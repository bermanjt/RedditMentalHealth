0,"When does drinking a little and watching sad videos become a problem? I've been doing this a few months now and I've been wondering if it is a real issue. At daytime I feel fine, I can smile when I'm having a good time, but when night comes, I just feel so hopeless. I resort to alcohol to idk make me sleepy? Maybe I enjoy feeling a little tipsy. And then comes the part where I listen to sad music or watch depressing videos to make myself cry. 

Does anybody else do this? Like, on a regular basis? This isn't me on every single night, but let's just say it's most nights of the week.",08Jun2019,3
1,"Two different issues at least I've got here.
My life is a depressed mess, i've not got friend's really and am unsure how to make any. My social skills are not good and I've got anxiety.
A recent breakup with my gf (f39 and she is f33) and also suffers from mental illness has left me devastated. I live for my fur babies, if i didn't have them I've no idea where I'd be.
In process of trying to find a therapist, I've always got along better with male psychologist, i had an awesome one for almost 7+ yrs before he retired and was awesome so we're trying to find me a new psychologist.
I feel like I'm hanging on by a frayed thread.
I'm actually the one who broke up with my exgf. She was really hurting me and i did not want to take the pain anymore. We both have our issues. I put my heart on the line and actually tried talking and she did try too. She told me she loved me for over a month i really fell for her.
 Anyway after not having seen her a few she canceled our plans out of nowhere and i was crushed. Despite the both of us texting lovey back &amp; forth. She was too into her family and didn't have friend's either. I broke it off, i am beyond repair. We should have started as friends and i should have said something yet I've never been really assertive.
I don't know anymore. I'm almost 40 and a broken human.
I'm willing to give any psychologist a chance at this point. I don't know what else to do. It's impossible to make friends since my social skills are horrible. 
Please, I'll take any advice that's kind. Constructive critism is fine. Please know i can't just go out there and make friend's, it's not easy as that for me.",08Jun2019,1
2,"Am i having a breakdown? I dont know whats going oncor how to describe it. Im just afraid. Of what i dont know, my life should be perfect: lots of friends, schools going good loving family nice hobbies. Yet i feel stressed. I sleep to little, not because i worry a lot, because i dont want to sleep. Yet in the morning i dont want to go to school. I go a week without being happy and then, when joking with friends, i realise i forgot what happiness is. My father had mental issues because of his abusive dad. Im afraid he things of himself as a bad dad because of it. He is messed up but I love him. I watch way to much youtube, if there is nothing new i rewatch the old, afraid of not being distracted from life i guess. When youtube stops music comes in the picture. I listen a lot. Nf, em, xxx, they make me happy (or distract me from the sad?). I just want control i guess, i dont want to ask for help, thatl give control away. I dont like God, he'll take control away i dont like the way i am right now. Maybe itll pass, maybe not. Im just so apethetic, I want change but i dont want to change i want to talk to anyone, yet i want to scream as loud as possible. I am not here for help or consolidation, i just wanted to write down what i feel. Its two thirty in the morning so i go to sleep now, goodbye.",08Jun2019,1
3,"I am plagued by the feeling that no one really likes being around me. And I know it's much more than just a negative unrealistic perception on my part. I suffer very badly from difficulties socializing in public with people I don't know well. At home I can be social and likeable, but at work and other public gatherings  I'm painfully shy and awkward. It's not a lack of social skills either. I know and am aware of what good things to say to people.....its more of a situation where I'm anxious and put on the spot and have difficulties following through. 

It's becoming a real problem for me because I have trouble coming off as a normal person during things like work, parties, weddings, funerals, etc. It feels like people actively try to avoid me and dont like me because of it. 

Does anyone else have this problem? I see a therapist but I can't get help for this. Every time I bring up that it's a problem and I need help with it I get told I'm fine and don't need help.",08Jun2019,1

5,"Every time I post something that has to do with my mental health, I feel it's a path down being judged as weak or being inadequate. My drinking habits has been less than helpful, but I've been driven to hopelessness, so in hopes that anyone might understand I've contacted Reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

I've contacted Ellen Degeneres for help. I've contacted Dr. Phil for help. I wanted some semblance of popularity to assist me because I've grown up in a city of ""popular"" and ""rich"" people that judged me my entire life if I wasn't like them. I don't blame all my problems on celebrities, but I feel heavily influenced by them. I realize that being ""popular"" in that community meant being cruel to those who couldn't defend themselves, but it felt too good to regret my actions, and even though it should be ""easy"" enough for me to absolve my childish ambitions I'm stuck feeling an immense sense of dread and doubt because I don't have the pull of the gifted, so thus I've made a negative name for myself in other communities because I know I'm not popular enough despite my constant attempts to be the best in my field. No one wants a washed-up, government-dependent leech.

Recovery is hard and I am willing to do the work. My ideal program would have more than one individual therapy session per week as well as groups and classes.  

Looking at reviews online can be daunting so thought I would extend the search to more strangers on the internet! :)

Any suggestions or feedback on your stay would be much appreciated. Thanks!",08Jun2019,1
8,"Some time ago when I lived in my depression and my anxiety clouded my mind I felt like there was something wrong with me. I know everyone feels this way at some point in their lives; but I felt it like I feel the wind ripple through my skin and chill my bones on a cool winters eve. You could say; some people are stronger than the inner voices (some are stronger than the unkind things bullies say) and some are strong but fall victim to the crippling pain of mental illnesses. I know this to be very true. Everyone has their own demons they fight within. Recently I realized just how odd I am though.

I’ve been living without depression and anxiety for a couple months now; some 2 or 3 months ago it was a roller coaster of emotions for me, without those issues weighing on me I’ve been seeing myself for who I truly am. But; even just before I fought my anxiety and depression I couldn’t understand how people were concerned about how I was planning to concur my illnesses... I told myself for the past 3 years that I should get a job; nothing too extensive just part time work local to me. For three years I let the depression tie me down to the bed, the couch, the kitchen table and chairs, to the inside of my own mind. For three years I let the anxiety eat away at my mind telling me about all the things I have done wrong, how people were watching me, the lady behind me at the market was talking about me, I let my illnesses consume me. What was my approach to fighting these emotions; these mental blood suckers who were killing me slowly??? To get the darn job I had been telling myself for three years to get. To go out and challenge myself in finding a place that I would be forced to interact with people every day I worked. My therapist and other folk in my “treatment box” thought that was counter productive; they thought I should continue therapy and get myself better under control.

I did what I wanted to do and man was it scary!

I put in an application to my local dollar store and sat for 2 weeks waiting for a phone call or nothing at all even. I waited and every day I would remind myself that I am not going to allow my depression to bring me down or my anxiety to shut me in. Finally I had to go to the store and buy some things; as soon as my partner and I arrived I said “I’m going to check on my application while I’m here.” I was nervous the entire time I walked into and through the store.... I was bottling it in but I felt my anxiety slowly creeping up as I approached the check out counter. While checking out I asked if the manager was in. I was determined to win this fight against my anxiety. He was; checking folk out at the next register. After checking out I told my partner to go ahead; I’d be out soon. I stood waiting for his line to clear and when it did I introduced myself and from that moment my anxiety cowered in my stomach. I got the job; that very day I was interviewed and started before the week was out. 

You see; I know I’m odd, because I am me. What I want people to get from this is;  no matter what stage of recovery you’re in, whether you haven’t started to recover, you’ve just begun, you’re working on it, you’re nearly where you want to be or you’ve recovered, you are an incredible and individual person. No one is like you; no one is as strong as you, no one is as determined as you. Not even you know what you’re truly capable of doing until you do it. I won the fight and have recovered from depression and anxiety. This won’t work for you. Why???? Because you are you and just because it worked for me doesn’t mean it will work for you; just as every medication, doctor, therapy style, method of treatment, or facility won’t work for everyone. Mental illnesses aren’t a one size fits all.

Be you! Stay strong! You are loved! You are lovable! You are meaningful! You have purpose! You’re not you’re mental illness; don’t let the diagnosis nor the pain of your mental illness consume you as it tried to do to me. It’s ok to seek help; to try and do things differently. You will get better. Yes relapse is real for mental health too; you can heal from it again and again so long as you... Never Give Up!",08Jun2019,2

Each day feels more and more hopeless.

12,"Being able to openly admit without judgement to people in your immediate surroundings, whether it is work or family or friends that you are feeling mentally broken down should be socially acceptable. Not only socially acceptable it should be the individual's duty to admit to others around him that his mental is being damaged. That way the others can support them, are aware of what's going on, and attempt to foster understanding between a group of people. This way we can start to take care of our people and individuals before we move onto solving the bigger problems.",08Jun2019,4
13,"I’ve been seeking help and receiving treatment for years now but every professional I see avoids answering this question.

I used to be so happy, energetic and stubborn despite being bullied my whole life. I tried to stay positive and wanted to believe in the good in people, and when there wasn’t good I just blocked them out. I was extremely social with people who where nice and loved spending time with friends, I had hopes and dreams and a vision of the future, I was so strong willed, it was near impossible to get me to do something I didn’t want to 

It’s been a few years since I broke and my personality and general outlook on the world has changed drastically. I feel empty, I always have this empty feeling like somethings missing, I no longer have any real control over my emotions and I haven’t felt real joy in years I’m either neutral, sad, angry or just emotionally exhausted,  I generally hate people as a whole, I feel absolutely no empathy towards other people  regardless of their connection to me, I don’t even know how to react and act like a person anymore, any extended time around people causes me large amounts of stress and often angers or upsets me, I can no longer watch tv as even shows I once loved just aggravate or upset me after a short period of time and my already bad memory had graduated to horrible, I forget things that happened seconds ago and I find it hard to even remember what people look like. I’ve just become weak willed, I no longer have the willpower to fight, argue or even commit to anything I don’t have to, the exception being if my anger boils over then it’s just f**k everybody I’m doing what I want, after which Im often exhausted and sleep for 15+ hours

I just want to feel whole again, I’m sick of being empty, I’m sick of wearing mask over mask over mask so nobody I know worries, I’m sick of feeling myself getting weaker and weaker as time passes, I’m sick of having no idea who I am anymore",08Jun2019,2

15,"For the past couple of years I’ve been experiencing mood swings. Each “up” and “down” usually lasts a couple of weeks. On the upper end of the spectrum, I am very happy but also tend to make bad decisions (once I broke up with my boyfriend and bought a house. Another time I impulse bought an expensive car. Both things seemed like good ideas at the time). On the lower end of the spectrum I find it difficult to keep up with work and other aspects of my life and mostly just mope around and drink and overeat. 

Obviously it’s an issue, but I’m not really sure how to go about getting treatment. First, most of the good mental health professionals are not accepting new patients. Second, the only times I ever feel like I need treatment is when I am at the “down” end of my cycle. I managed to make an appointment once, but ended up cancelling it when my mood improved.

21,"Five things Men don’t like to talk about and How they ALL happened to me

The walls of my community hospital gleam in a stucco patterning and a Koi pond shimmers in the atrium. On any day, It is a happy place. Candy stripers wait to provide direction and support, a chaplain usually wanders, and most of the people you see are coming out, not going in. It’s not the hospital that’s special, but the town we live in; quiet and charming, on the coast. In all regards it is the ideal city for peaceful living. The ideal city for peaceful living, that is, if you aren’t thinking about swallowing a bottle of Ativan and chasing it down with Belvedere. I happened to be feeling that way, and it finally got too powerful for my logical brain to fight it.
A term I would come to learn over the next few hours is Anhedonia, the inability to garner pleasure in simple daily activities. I would also learn that as a man, I make up a startling statistic: 75% of suicide victims in the United States are male. Every twenty minutes, a man in the United States takes his own life. Yet men are the least likely to explore mental health treatment, and as a kind psychiatrist put “often end up in the coroner’s office instead of that comfortable couch.”
So what led me from sober, listening to country music, to curling up sobbing in front of a crisis worker? I’d say the answer is simple. I mean, the music couldn’t be THAT bad. The past five years though? They’ve been hell. I have destroyed myself with vices, my brain hurts, I can sense the regrets in my bones. My living situation is hell and I’m lucky to even have that. I thought I could be the fat cat,  and it turns out, I’m kind of just a fat mess. I use the word fat erroneously, because over the last month, I lost 20 pounds from stress. The worst part of it all, is the dishonesty: I haven’t talked to anyone about any of it. Not a dime or cent. Reddit is a great place to stay anonymous and explain how you’re doing, but it’s also a great place to pretend to get things out. I made that foolish mistake.
Five years of hell started easy enough.
 My parents were moving after my high school graduation and I didn’t want to go with them. I had slipped up my last year in school, smoked weed, skipped class. There was a couple angry incidents with Mom and Dad and there was even an arrest: I fucked up at prom, provided my entire party bus with alcohol, and caught a “contributing to the delinquency of a minor” charge. I can attribute this behavior to something specifically. My brother, who had a history of hitting my mom and threatening her, and a history of sabotaging my life in the weirdest ways possible, was finally removed from our home and I was the only child left. I explored my freedom from under my brother’s thumb. My parents, happy to be left with only my ADD to deal with and no death threats, may have let me have a little more freedom than usual too. I wanted to be cool, to fit in for the first time, and I took it way too far. 
In hindsight, this is one of the biggest regrets I have. If I had just moved with my parents, and stopped being a little asshole, I could’ve gone on to college and even been in a happy career right now. On the day before their move, I approached them and told them I didn’t want to go with them, that I had a girl I liked who would have a place for me to stay and friends I could keep there in town and I honestly wouldn’t take no for an answer.  
My parents had put up with enough, I think. 
     Watching them drive away in their moving van after the arrangements were made, I was the king of the world.
     That lasted for all of twenty minutes when I realized the girl who was going to pick me up didn’t like me as much as I thought, my suitcase was gigantic, and NOONE was coming to help me. A normal person would call their parents then. I decided I was smarter than that.
A random friend fit me into his day, and soon I was off at a random house, smoking pot and talking about big dreams. A couple beers with the random friend led to an agreement. Crash out here, get a job, find a way to live and then move on. Sounded easy enough, all things considered. I’d gotten paid fat by the relatives for graduation, and I figured I could save up enough for an apartment quickly.
The summer after graduation for a couch surfer is an interesting thing. Lots of new and amazing things to spend your money on, a total lack of adult supervision, and, for some reason, a total disregard for the things your parents have spent the past 18 years teaching you. I went nuts. I worked at a pizza shop (barely) I had drinks every 
night, smoked my pot, and forgot my purpose entirely. I awoke two weeks later to a cup of hot chocolate and a message: a different place had been found for me, and I needed to vacate the premises; the friend had managed to find me a job and another couch but he’d about had it. Off I went to the next “adventure”.
This was where things started getting dicy. We were a house of all young men and there were parties every night of the week. The head of the house was my manager at work, and he was right there getting drunk with me, so structures fell apart completely. 
I distinctly remember the night that set this house on fire at the foundations: A guy named Tree got mad and tried to fight me, (also everyone else) a guy named Duke had to help me carry a girl to a taxi because she was too drunk to stand, the head of the house caught someone snorting cocaine in his room and assaulted him with a shillelagh. Tree kicked the door down to his bedroom and the bathroom. A hamster I had adopted got thrown over the fence. We got evicted from that house.
The move out week I shrugged off responsibility as usual and left everyone else to clean while I went to my first festival: I had a threesome with a guy and a girl there and spent the entire week in a drunken stupor. It wasn’t exactly my “first time” but it was close enough to my loss of virginity that I felt like a rock star.  While there, I met yet ANOTHER guy who was willing to let me crash at his place. This one dragged me all the way to Missouri to help him work on his Dad’s ranch house. 
 Dad had one rule while we were there, and of course I broke it. He didn’t want me touching his daughter. His daughter and I had already been talking for weeks before I came to the house. She was the hottest girl that had ever paid attention to me. It took me all of two days to break said rule, and before long, The dad found out. I thought he was going to kill me, but instead he told me I had to move on from his house and find a place to go. I knew I’d fucked up and didn’t argue, I was way too lucky to be walking on two feet with no broken teeth. The sexual act itself was embarrassing to say the least, I lasted less than thirty seconds. I laugh about that sometimes, because that thirty seconds royally fucked up my life. After this terribly long backstory, that brings us to item number one.

                                                  Sexual Abuse
   The next phase of my life gets pretty weird.  Maybe I should start by saying however crazy, this happened to me, and I've been carrying it around with me for far too long. For years I believed the lies someone told me, how he had proof that everything was consensual, not realizing that I was just falling into his trap again and again. 
      After my friend’s dad kicked me out, I was pretty desperate to go anywhere I could to remain off the streets.  By some miracle ( at 22 the miracle is now more apparent to me) I scored a job at a traveling zoo that runs a course from Virginia to Georgia, stopping at county fairgrounds and community festivals, sometimes doing college lectures and rescue efforts as well. I thought I was happy as can be, feeding and caring for monkeys and kangaroos and even a big tiger. I was a dumb fucking kid.
      Over the course of six months from October 2013 to March 2014 my boss, (we’ll call him Bill) raped me 5 times. When I came back to the establishment in 2015 to false promises he raped me again. He convinced me that it was all consensual and he promised me things, but when I didn’t want to do it, he would coerce me harder and harder until I gave in. he drugged me on three separate occasions with opiates to have his way more easily. He insisted on not using protection because he was allergic to latex.
It started early on, when I first arrived to work at the zoo, although for him, the planning probably started when he picked up the telephone and heard easy prey on the other line. The funny thing is, when I called him to ask about the job, i was suspicious of his establishment. Something didn’t seem right. I called him out on it, said his pitch sounded like bait, he got upset and hung up. I called my mother to tell her about the job prospect and how it sounded weird and together we looked online. This man was famous. He had animals on the today show. His monkeys were in movies and perched on actor’s shoulders. I fucked up. I called him back apologizing.
      And of course he accepted. The next week I was on a bus down to the zoo and there we were, in the midst of a carnival, training monkeys and riding camels and horses and all was well for a few days. So i thought.
     The first night i got shitfaced at a party the fair was throwing. Bill noted my attraction to alcohol.
        The first weekend, Bill saw the flirty attention I was taking to look at a gentleman in the crowd. But Bill also saw the same flirty attention I was giving to a female in the crowd. Bill took note of my sexual confusion.
I remember the first night we drove together in the main semi, after the fair was over and we were packed heading to the next location. His tone got more and more sly as we talked through the night. I remember him telling me stories I would one day find out were lies, but at the time, I trusted him and they awed me. I was a sheltered kid and I didn’t know any better. And then I heard him say “ why don’t you give it a little wiggle?”. I looked over and he had his fucking cock out. 
     I’m 18, alone in a semi with a guy who’s bigger than me, away from all known family and friends, traveling to god knows where in the middle of the night. The situation has delved into creepy as hell and it’s all my fault, but I do it, because, what the hell, it’s only a cock and i can’t lose this job and be dumped in the middle of the road. I wish I had made him pull over then. I can’t  BELIEVE I didn’t realize how BAD that situation was. I had no idea how hard it would traumatize me. Time number one.
 In november we made our way to Savannah, Georgia, for an annual festival at a racetrack. Bill had a partnership with a hotel there and they paid a contract to stay on the track for the entire month, bringing our animal activities to the public attending. Of course, with that contract came hotel rooms, and that’s when my hell really started.
     The first time, Bill brought all of us to the hotel to sleep ( it didn’t happen very often, because usually we had to stay with the animals and make sure they were ok) and at the last second, pulled a sneaky move and told me I’d be staying with him. Him asking me to give him a back massage ( which, again, far away from my family or friends was a request that kind of had to be honored) ended up with him being naked, and that turned into him forcing me to take my clothes off, because he just wanted to see, and before I know it I’m in the middle of his fucked up fantasy. Another man using you in that way without your permission is probably the worst feeling I can describe, and that time fucking hurt. I can remember how it felt to this second. I thought about leaving that night, but where the hell was I going to go?
     And then that happened again. And again. He made me send him text messages “telling him what I wanted him to do to me” and I would just make stuff up because I didn’t know what else to say. This was the clincher. I knew the second I’d try to tell someone, these messages would come out and nobody would ever believe me.  He’d had other interns before me and I’m pretty sure he did this with all of them. 
       The third time he brought a bottle of pills and told me to take one. It was oxycontin and it made things a little bit easier. This whole time he convinced me if I told anyone, my life would be over, he’d out me to my family, he’d tell them all the nasty things we did together.


     On the fourth time, I finally had the strength to leave. I waited until night, I made it as far as the hotel itself from the racetrack before I realized it was cold and HE realized I was gone. I think he knew I was going to tell the police so he begged me to come back. He bought me a plane ticket home to my parents that night and he told me to take a vacation. I don’t think he was thinking very clearly. I never got on the return flight. I never wanted to see him again.
     In 2015 I began to miss my animals, badly, and the trauma from the previous events hadn’t fully taken over my life. Like the dumb kid I was, I decided to give Bill another try. I rang him up and he told me everyone out there missed me, and if I came on down, We would talk about how things were better (there were other problems I was having beyond the obvious one with Bill).
I made my bed on the couch at his place when I drove down, because someone was in the spare room, and i thought that would be sufficient enough to keep things pg. I was wrong. I hadn’t even been in the house for 15 hours when Bill decided to pull his shit again. I told him I was going to yell out and he still put his hands down my pants. I should have yelled. I left again that night, drove all the way back to my home in california, and I told myself that that was the end of bill. I couldn’t prove he raped me, so I needed to move on with my life. Rape crisis centers aren’t for men. Going to the hospital and saying “ I was raped” has to be the most degrading thing one could do. It put a new respect for people, not just men in my heart. If I can’t do that as a big strong tiger trainer guy, how can we expect women to do that everyday? Women are by far stronger than men.

                       HOMELESSNESS
Let’s take a step back. Based on the other events happening in my life around this time, you can probably guess I ran out of places to go after my first adventure with the zoo. I came back to California in 2014, and after a whirlwind of parties and reunions I found out the sad truth: No one had a place for me. My actions in each of those houses led to that, I’m sure. I don’t know how I managed to get a hold of a tent or sleeping bag, but  I had just visited my parents a few days ago and I sure as hell wasn’t asking for more help.
    I found a group of people in town that I knew to be bums and they took me in gladly. I don’t think I’ve ever found a more accepting group of people than the ones we see huddled in bus stops and parks. The first stint of homelessness wasn’t terrible, actually. I had a good job at a bike shop and they let me borrow the bike for a ride “home” everyday. That combined with a decent paycheck led to an easy go round. Around town I was known for taking care of my fellow “travellers”, and I have to admit I loved the gypsy lifestyle. 
  But, it was cold. The coldness pervaded everything, and before I knew it, I had grown very ill. I knew I had to get off the streets and fast.  I managed to find a transitional home for young adults my age, and being on the verge of death quickly helped me secure a room. 
Here, I met some of the worst role models I’ve ever had (I’ve had some doozies), and my life started to really take a turn down a hellish path.
  I sort of thought these three were my best friends, and over the years, they’ve certainly gone out of their way to protect me, but without them, I would never have left transitional housing and I would be well on my way to a good life. We stayed out every night until just before curfew, smoked pot, drank, all things we knew we weren’t supposed to do. My friend Kirk  snuck girls into his room. Someone hid a lemon under another resident’s bed and left it for months, leaving them to wonder where the smell was coming from.
 Kirk got caught one night, by the police, with his plastered underage girlfriend’s pants down in the street in front of the house. He went to the drunk tank and barely avoided a statutory rape charge. 
 
       The rest of us got a drug test and a thirty day notice to vacate our program.

It felt like there was no point staying somewhere where we couldn’t have the fun we were having, just to be thrown out in thirty days and falling into homelessness. So I adopted a three-legged dog and left two days into my grace period. I swear to god my future self slaps my younger self in the face every time I remember this, but off I went to the streets again with my new best friend. 

     This second bout of homelessness was brutal. If I hadn’t had the dog, I think I probably would have killed myself. Around this time my city passed laws restricting the homeless population and started regulating hard. For someone on his second round in the streets, this was really discouraging. The rules from the first round had all changed, and I was pretty lost as what to do. Some of the worst memories come from this period of time. I remember being huddled in the middle of my tent with a knife out one night because my mate had fallen asleep with food wrappers on him and the racoons wouldn’t go away. I came to my tent one day to find my entire life’s possessions gone, drawings, photos, memories, even my Passport and Birth certificate. To this day there could be someone running around with my identity and I’d never know. I got sick again, very sick. I cared more about that dog than anyone else though, and I always made sure he had food to eat before I did. 
      It was around this time that I met Maya. Maya has been faithful to me for 3 years now, even when I can’t say the same for myself. If anyone has had it harder than me, it’s probably her, always helping behind the scenes. She even stuck around when I ran off to the zoo that second time, taking our car and our cat with me. Maya has forgiven me even when I can’t forgive myself for the things I’ve done. 
Even she isn’t a superhero though, and this camp-out lasted much longer than the first one. She understood my predicament and brought me food and supplies when she could, helped me get around. She introduced me to her parents as her boyfriend and made me feel like I was part of a family for the first time in a very long time. She cleaned me up, taught me how to drive, stuck me in a suit and got me a job selling cars. We moved into a house in Marina and life seemed like it was good for a while.

I don’t know why I never talked to anyone about my homelessness. There were so many people I could’ve reached out to for help, ut the loss of my dignity and my profound sense of pride kept me in a horrible situation.


                                                     REGRET
      Contrary to my past predicaments, my ability to endure in less than ideal situations is slim to none. I got the heroin rush of selling a few cars, but the money was quickly spent. We couldn’t seem to save it. We bought a car instead of saving up. I constantly took trips with my friends up to San Francisco.  My girlfriend and I started fighting. 
    My Cassius was a good dog, hopping along wherever I went on his three legs, and every single person I knew loved him. Our landlady? Thought he was the spawn of satan and went out of her way to make our lives miserable about him. Eventually she hit us with, “get rid of this dog, or get out of my house” and even though I was heartbroken, I looked round for someone to take him. 
     We had a few people take him, but it turns out Cassius was more heartbroken about leaving me than I was of him. Everywhere he went he whined and cried and begged to be brought back to me. I re-homed him with a guy who owned a boat, and boat-guy brought him back the next day. The harbor patrol threatened to remove him because the dog was crying so loud. That was my buddy.
         We couldn’t leave our home and our landlady was getting worse and worse. She was a drunk, and when she drank she would get mean, and one day she busted in, told us to either take the dog to the pound or leave.
                    

                                        We took the dog to the SPCA.

They told me my dog was too aggressive to be put in with the others and he would probably be put down if I surrendered him.
    My heart broke. How is a three legged dog going to hurt anybody’s lost pet or the massive collection of pit bulls the SPCA seems to gather daily? I couldn’t imagine my buddy, my best friend being put to sleep on some cold ground somewhere away from me.
     So I signed him in for euthanization instead. I went back there with him myself, and I held him as they put that needle into his body and he went limp. I cried over him for longer than I was supposed to. They had to make me leave. I didn’t have enough money to get ashes or pawprints or anything special. I could afford the empty space in my chest.


The landlady gave us a notice to move out the next week. Fucking bitch.


We found somewhere else to live and went, but it was too late. My motivation to do anything was gone. My best friend was gone. I slipped up at work and stopped selling cars. I got in fights constantly with my girlfriend. In all fairness, I should have sensed something was wrong mentally back then.
       I started regretting everything I had ever done, coming back from the stupid zoo, all the homeless bullshit, the pills I had to take to even be a functioning member of society. I started missing my animals at the zoo. They had always been a source of refuge and comfort. When I reached a breaking point, I called Bill and I went back. That was the fifth time he took advantage of me and from there, I was pretty much lost.
      I should have talked to someone. Anyone. I should have known better than to force myself into that awful situation again. I was back home to an upset but happy maya but we had nowhere to live. I had quit my job and left spontaneously, maya had gone to stay with her sister, and that two days put us back on the streets.
          We started staying in hotels, sleeping in our parked car, staying in the tent up at the campgrounds. To cope I would buy alcohol, pot, anything to take the thought of what an awful person I was away. Maya just loved me. Maya gave me what I wanted because she wanted me to be happy.



                                                      SUBSTANCE ABUSE 
   I got more and more involved with drugs. A friend of mine manufactured Dimethyltryptamine, and I started dosing it almost weekly, as if my trips would help me see the light in my situation and get out of it.
     They did the opposite. I started to be disgusted with my girlfriend, disgusted with my life, disgusted with the person I’d become. I asked maya to help me move to L.A, and she could go live with her parents again, and she conceded; For the next few months, I survived alone with her finances in the heart of hollywood. I met superstars and even worked at a famous celebrity’s restaurant for a while.
       I fell in love with a different girl. I started cheating on my guardian angel. Her family was beautiful, and she took me riding on her horses. We shared a passion for veterinary work, we had the same interest in movies and books, we were outcasts, in a way. I explained away why i was living in hotels and airbnbs and for a while, I was as happy as can be.
        Then the regret and depression hit.
I found myself wanting to be home with maya, and home I went. I moved in with Kirk and his girlfriend and maya stayed at her parent’s house, and we started the struggle all over again.
    Being back home, I feel back into the same ways, smoking pot and drinking heavily, dosing with psychedelics. I found a hotel in the town next to me where the manager partied with us in the owner apartment, and during a one week bender, I started into Heroin and Cocaine. A girl named Chloe tested my relationship again. Thank god I stuck with Maya. No matter how bad my life is now, I thank her and the lord every day for the slap from her that got me out of that hotel and back into the light.
       After three months of not being able to find employment, we decided again that my town was not the place for me. I went off to Denver with Maya supporting me from afar. For the first time I had a house and yard and I thought I was happy. I stopped abusing drugs completely, and started sticking with cannabis and alcohol.
                                                   

                       ISOLATION
      In Denver I had perhaps the best of my experiences. My roommate ran a puppy rescue and I helped her with it daily. I started going out and making friends, and the weird places they took me would break me out of my shell a little bit. But the past couple of years had finally started to catch up with me and I now had a safe sheltered environment to curl up in. I was somewhere I trusted. 
     I remember my very first panic attack. It was at a bar called Machete in boulder.  The air round me got all fuzzy and I felt like I was hearing the world through seashells. I felt like I couldn’t breathe and I just wanted to escape.
     At this point in my life I had started operating with the understanding that the things happening to me were my fault and my job alone to deal with. Several people, including my roommate, started suggesting mental help.
   I went further and further into my shell. Things like Postmates and UBEReats kept me from having to leave the house. When I did go out, I put on a happy face, but I was constantly looking over my shoulder. One night, I heard scratching and pounding at my backdoor; I grabbed a knife and stood at it, prepared, only to find my roommate coming through it, terrified that I would have such a reaction. I ignored all these signs.
    I only lasted a year in Denver, and destroyed nearly every relationship I built by flaking out on plans, arguing with friends over seeking help, and generally being stagnant. Eventually, Maya had enough of me being far away and ordered me to return to Monterey.

     We moved in with DMT guy’s old roommate, Daniel, and for the next few months, I stayed in doors and we bickered with each other constantly. I hated my life and had noone to talk to. I started making my way through 2 bottles of wine a night, and spent my days playing video games or sleeping. 
               My brother came to town two months into this, and my girlfriend, feeling sympathy, told him he could crash indefinitely. He’s still here. He’s lied about every single situation that led him to this moment, including his military service, whether or not he’s been a police officer, and the reason he isn’t allowed to see his kid anymore. Every day with him is another day of drama. 2 weeks ago, he attacked me, and that triggered memories of him beating my mom as she screamed for help in our bathrooms and kitchens, of him lying to my friends at school in the weirdest ways to sabotage my life, of his psychopathy in every aspect of life not directly advantaging him. He’s a monster, but he’s a monster that gets away with everything. He’s definitely a hard person to be around, and his presence here led me to the clinic. My time at the clinic was short-lived because I had to go home and deal with my brother causing problems in the house. 
   
    
 Since writing this he’s been caught impersonating a police officer, removed from my home, and the stress level is a tiny bit better. He’s off somewhere in Colorado, and we’ve kind of given up on him. I hope one day he gets his life together. I hope that for myself as well. I haven’t gotten much better, but every day is a new day and we’re taking it one step at a time. I hope my story can help someone else not make the same mistakes I made, and encourage others to speak up if someone is hurting you or life is getting you down. Writing this was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, and at the end I see that it doesn’t paint me as the good person I thought I was. Try to see where your life went south and learn from that moment, because I sure haven’t. #:#",08Jun2019,1
22,"Hi, I am a 13 year old so i haven't been able to experience many things yet. The reason that is important is that I could be depressed and have no idea. because I have not been able to experience enough to differentiate. Now that you have an idea of why I would be confused i will get on to the problem at hand. This started in the summer of last year (I am homeschooled) and school was starting again in 2 weeks (I don't know why i remember this so vividly) and i was playing a game on my phone (It was a pinballl game with different themes (I was on the elder scrolls theme)) with a TV show in the background (Dinotrux Netflix Original like I said i remember it very vividly) the day went on as you would expect a 12 year olds day to go played some games chilled out etc. that was the last day i remember being able to think straight. ever since then school has been an extreme challenge. now to the actual problem I have always been a smart kid but since that day if I use my brain too much i have a mental breakdown and i have no clue why (also something else weird which may be normal i can remember things EXTREMELY well but i can't access them  example: math problem 9 \* 8 my brain will have the answer subconsciously in an instant but it will take my conscious about 10 -15 seconds to reach the number) if anyone has any idea what this is and/or what i could do about it I would appreciate it immensely",08Jun2019,2
23,"I know I can't fix a problem without first knowing what it is, but I'm doing exactly that. I have no clue as to what the fuck is wrong with me, and yet I try to fix it anyway. 

Anyways, I work 3 jobs currently, one of which I have had for over 3 years, but across all 3 years, I have failed time and time again to get even a single employee of the month award. I pass everybody in my field stat wise, and I'm usually quiet and keep to myself. I never really dog on anybody outside of solitude. I have also applied for manager twice, both tries met with failure due to my ""overarching mood."" When I asked what this meant, both times I was told it wasn't because of rudeness or anything, but that I ""Just give off a saddening aura."" I took a class for a whole year on how to manage stress, still feel like I have learned nothing important, and as if that which I did learn has had no effect. I've basically given up at this point, and so I tried to go back to art, because I used to be good at it when I practiced a lot. But now, I have nowhere near enough time to practice and draw enough to make any money on it. I usually work 80 hours a week, most early morning to late night due to overlapping shifts. I can't even draw hands well anymore. 

The only reason I haven't offed myself yet is my damned dog. I love him more than anything. I may want to kill myself now, but I cant do it until he passes of old age. He at least deserves a good life, what with all the love he's given me. Other than my dog, I've been alone my entire life, since my only two friends moved across the country. One died recently in Arizona due to getting caught in gang violence. And the other is a 300lb beggar, that still lives with his mother, and gets angry when he has to help out at home, even though he lives there for free and is supplied everything he could want, even a gaming computer in the $2000 range. For free. Complains about the connection at his house.

Maybe I just spend too much time comparing myself to others. Regardless, I'll be gone as soon as my dog leaves.",08Jun2019,2
24,"I've [22 M] spent the last 5 years trying different medications and CBT methods for major depression and anxiety, but I've still found myself self-harming and relapsing over and over. I have the tendency to bottle everything up and I have a hard time telling even my closest friends about what I struggle with. It's almost been a year without self-harming, but I've picked up the habit again.

I recently went through an abrupt ""break-up"" (there wasn't really a label on what we were) and after some reflection on what I can do to better myself and cope differently, I realized that some of my self-harming urges come from pent-up emotions and frustrations. 

The guy I was in a ""relationship"" with was the only person that I had ever opened up to completely, and I was really trusting of him. He had offered me his support and I took it, but he ended up being someone I somewhat regret confiding in. 

During an argument we had the night of the break-up, he snapped (to be fair, I was drunk texting) and brought up the fact that I needed to ""just stop"" with the self-loathing because it was *annoying. I had never imagined hearing that from him, especially after believing he'd be there to point me in the right direction, at the very least, if I'd ever broke down like that. It's affected me a lot more than I initially thought, and I think it might've actually been what triggered me to self-harm again. Always telling myself that others might be annoyed with me was the exact reason why I never felt comfortable talking to anyone. 

All of that being said, I'm absolutely terrified of losing another person I love because of this. I know that not everyone would react that way, but I've lost all courage to talk to my friends about my mental health, regardless of how close they are to me. I'm working out and trying to learn how to play the guitar, but I still get strong urges to cut every so often. I've also tried meditating, red markers/paint, rubber bands, and ice as an alternative, but I can't say they do very much for me. Has anyone found any other alternatives that work for them? I'm really sick of seeing more scars on myself.

TLDR: I think I resort to self-harm because I struggle to confide in anyone and I'm looking for alternatives to cutting. Any free CBT programs or something similar that people have had success with would also be a great help.",08Jun2019,1

I overeat, maybe that's a stress thing but I don't know. I feel lazy, which only makes me feel worse about myself. I'm socially awkward, and struggle with talking with people and maintaining and making relationships. I just don't want to feel like crap anymore.

27,"So, I'm not really sure how to put this so I guess I'll just try and make some sense of it... At the beginning of this year, I became very anxious regarding school,starting. I had done rather well the year before and so the last thing I wanted to happen was muck up my last year. So of course, the only thing that went through my mind was exactly that. I know this sounds odd, but as a response, I would hold my breath until I had 'corrected' the ‘wrong thoughts’ my bairn had told me. Half a year in, it's affected me more than I thought. I CANNOT CONCENTRATE without hearing voices of other people talking in my head or having sudden emotions that are simple not normal or required for that situation. To put this into context, my biggest fear was being arrogant over my previous successes as I hate arrogant people. So now, of course, these voices say exaggerated compliments etc when I don't want them to. Yes, I am aware that the fact these distinct voices exists is a warning sign, but I need your help to try and tell whats wrong. Hopefully at least some of this made sense.

Some other facts I should mention, I am 15 and this issue has existed since before puberty. Yes, I have told one of my closest friends about this, she reccomended a therapist because she has one, but I don't like strangers.

32,"I wouldn't say I have depression but rather, every time I (20F) come home from college, I start feeling really down, unmotivated, hypochondriacal, and constantly have existential crises. I find that I'm always thinking about the same few things everyday. When I'm at school, I'm like the complete opposite and I have a lot of energy and ambition. Whenever I come home for break, I get very nostalgic and think about my childhood in a regretful way. For the majority of my summer break, I've been spending time at my job, outside with friends, or studying in my room.   
My parents are almost always in a grumpy, passive-aggressive mood and are always spitting sarcasm at each other. I just find it very difficult to have genuine conversations with them. They almost never discuss or communicate in healthy ways. My parents fret over the smallest, most insignificant things and when they project their annoyances onto me, I just comply with them and do whatever they say. In a way, this makes me feel more depressed and apathetic. Because of their attitude, I feel like I am the reason why they are always upset and that I am never good enough. 

I know that they love me very much but I find it hard to spend time with them if most of the daily things they do stress me out and make me feel depressed. I want to spend more time with them before I move out but I don't know how.

34,"I have avoidant personality disorder and one thing I do is CONSTANTLY think like as if I'm talking to another person.

The thought is if I think how they act I'll start being cool. I think like this constantly. Is a good strategy for reducing these thoughts simply just putting a stop to them? It's not as easy as it sounds, I tried it for a few minutes, I have to remind myself literally every 1-5 seconds and it was mentally exhausting but also it felt somewhat freeing and gave me a sense of normalcy. Is it a good strategy? I understand it's not gonna get rid of the feelings, but at least I'll be able to think consciously of an emotion or what I want, like thinking ""i'm nervous"" (something i was never thought i was able to do until earlier today, normally i get a bad feeling but i can't describe why or what).

40,"Hello all.

I have been struggling with a mental issue for years, and I have no idea what it is. I’ve searched multiple areas of Google, and am still lost.

For years, I have felt like people that I know have been watching me. I don’t believe it is a paranoia thing, nor do I think they sneak around and watch me from afar. Basically, if someone is of interest of me in my life (not necessarily romantically), I’ll believe they’re able to watch me wherever I am. I’ll even talk out loud as if they’re listening to me. Sometimes I’ll adjust my behavior/what I’m doing to tailor to what they would find interesting/cool, almost like I’m trying to make them believe I’m a cool person, or to think I’m interesting. 

When I take a step back and think rationally, I know that there truly isn’t a way for them to actually watch me or know what I’m doing, and I get embarrassed by this habit, especially when someone walks in on me speaking to myself.

45,"This is going to be a pretty long post, and I apologize for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 10 years old, something traumatic happened that either directly or indirectly became the catalyst of lifelong anxiety.

My life became ruled by anxiety, always looming over everything, making it near impossible to function in almost every aspect of day to day life. 

It stayed with me through everything, even if I wasn’t worrying about anything specific in that moment, I would still have anxiety as if it was a part of my being, in the same sense that thoughts are an integral part of the mind, even if you’re not thinking of anything specific, you’re still thinking.  

Some of the specific areas that would be the focus of my anxiety were; 

Completely mundane and trivial things (eg. Swearing, thinking negatively about someone etc.)

Anticipation (eg. If there was something scheduled for 3 months in the future, I’d be dreading it every day until, not being able to focus on anything else.)

Delusions that never happened (eg. Thinking “What if I did something wrong or bad that I just don't remember, therefore rendering me powerless to even address it” and/or “What if I did something wrong or bad in my sleep while sleepwalking” and/or “what if I did something bad or wrong on accident, but really, I subconsciously wanted or intended to do it, and I'm just trying to convince myself that it was accidental” etc etc.)

Irrational and excessive worries (eg. A family member leaves somewhere, and if they’re 2 minutes late getting back, or if they weren’t answering calls/texts, my mind would immediately start formulating worst case scenarios for what may have happened to them. I would have to be pulled out of school for days to weeks when one of my family members would leave on a business trip.)  

Tying into the Irrational and excessive worries often included a kind of “all or nothing” type aspect, where if I had some commitment I would always think it was over if anything happened. (eg. If I was dating someone and I talked to another person in a flirty way (or at least what my mind decided was flirty), that would automatically nullify the entire relationship. Like “Oh no, I did this therefore there is no redemption, it’s already ruined so there is no point continuing on.”. It was the same thing about me thinking I was going to hell, “I did this, no redemption, there’s no point in even trying anymore, because my fate is sealed.”)

An example of one of the delusions I remember having from when I was a child; 

What if for some reason I had a pill (eg. Tylenol, Aspirin etc) in my pocket for some reason unbeknownst to me, and unaware it was even there. While I was walking down the sidewalk, I went to pull something out of my pocket. But in the process of pulling my hand out of my pocket, the pill fell out onto the ground, where someone came along, picked it up and ate it, then died because they were allergic or whatever else. Then that means I killed them, and I’m going to hell.  

In the earlier years of my anxiety, it was underscored with heavy guilt and the constant thought that I was going to go to hell.

It didn’t matter how inconsequential, or how trivial the thought that I was currently brooding over was, it always left me in despair and the thought that my entire life was over because of whatever I was anxious about in that moment. It would eat at me and my conscience to the point of tears, keeping me in a state of constant mental and physical anguish (I was always sick and in physical pain, it was the worst in my stomach, like there was acid eating at it). These things weren't just like every now and then, it was literally all day, every day, constant, perpetual guilt, anxiety, fear and despair. It took over my life, it dictated literally everything I did or didn’t do. 

All of this gave rise to a form of OCD, where I would have to confess my delusions to someone, and they would have to assure me that I wasn't going to go to hell. Doing that would give me very brief and short lived relief for a few hours, until something else would inevitably creep into my thoughts and start the cycle over.

It became a compulsion, to where I would need to confess, or else I couldn’t do, nor think, of anything else until I did. It was just as much of a compulsion as my other, non-anxiety compulsions, like having to check that the stove wasn’t on a dozen times before I could sleep, or having to shower in a specific way, lest I have to take another shower right after the first. 

I would have to make multiple phone calls from school daily to the person(s), so that I could confess whatever delusion was eating at me at that point, and be assured that I wasn't going to go to hell.

When I was a little bit older (mid to late teen years), I did make many attempts at living a healthy life, forcing myself to go out and do things like hang out with friends, get jobs etc, but none of it was ultimately sustainable. 

I got a TBI in 2008, and it whether it was just coincidence in the timing or if it was the cause, the anxiety escalated to the next level. I ended up dropping out of school, because it was doing far more harm than good. I couldn't learn, socialize or engage in anything, so I just stopped going. I started doing drugs to cope, mainly just opiates and benzodiazepines to which I became addicted. Mostly because for the first time in my life, my anxiety would subside. As one could imagine, things started going down the drain pretty rapidly. 

After some time, I ended up getting clean, and this is my 6th year of sobriety. But all of the anxiety just went back to how it was before I had used drugs.

It really is difficult to communicate just how severe, debilitating and overwhelming all of this was on me without sounding like I’m whining about all of it.

Throughout the years I would see many many doctors, therapists, psychiatrists and other specialists, being in and out of several different psychiatric facilities and trying a very very vast amount of different medications, all of which did nearly nothing, if anything at all. And by many, I mean dozens upon dozens of different meds, close to 10 (+1/-1) stays at 6 different psych facilities, and even more doctors. I eventually quit trying to get help from the medical community when my doctor and 2 other people (The 2 other people worked at the hospital as well, I don’t know why all 3 of them had to come and talk to me. I don’t remember who they were or their titles) told me that they wanted to get me into ECT treatment, because nearly everything else was exhausted. I never tried it, mainly because of financial reasons. 

Around the beginning of 2018 I started really losing the energy and will to keep fighting with my anxiety in making attempts at socializing, employment or anything else, I was quickly becoming too tired for it all. In May 2018, I could only muster up one last attempt at beating the anxiety, and if it failed, then that was it. No more tries, I would just accept it and let it consume me, because I was just done. So, my plan actually ended up working very well, and I was feeling optimistic about my future. But it eventually all fell apart, because why wouldn’t it. 

So I just gave up. I was frustrated, angry, bitter and sad. It broke my heart. So in the wake of that failure, I started to become very reclusive, to the point where I would only leave my apartment maybe once every 2 or 3 months (the last time I left my apartment was back February 21st of this year)

I don’t know what happened, but sometime after my attempt had failed, I became more and more apathetic, emotionless, uninterested and uncaring about anything. I stopped having any type of desires and goals, like my brain just flipped a switch and turned everything off. 

For some reason, not only my anxiety, but every emotion is gone. I don’t get happy, sad, worried, excited etc etc, I don’t even get bored. Someone could tell me that my legs needed to be amputated and I literally would not care even a little bit. Literally not at all. 

Any desires, goals, interests or motivations became moot as well. I have no desire to do anything at all. I don’t care about making and maintaining relationships, getting a job or planning for the future in any way. I’m not doing any of this on purpose, it all just happened. 

I did used to fantasize a lot about being like the emotionless, stoic badass portrayed in movies and games, but the reality of it is much less romantic. It’s kinda just “meh”.

I’m just wondering if anyone could help explain what’s going on and what happened for my mind to make such a dramatic shift. Why now? I’ve been trying to suppress my emotions and anxiety for my entire life to no avail, but then it just happened when I stopped trying? 

I also want to be clear, I’m in no way complaining about my current situation, it is a hell of a lot better than having to deal with the constant anxiety that I used to have. I apologize about the length of my description, I just really wanted to emphasize just how much of a polar shift had taken place.",08Jun2019,1

48,"So I'm super procrastinating. I got released from a 72 hour mental health hold 7hrs ago. This is the summary I have time to give. I have been taking 200mg lamotrigine for 6 months (for major depressive order) and vyvanse 40mg for over a 1 1/2 year (for ADD.) Prior to my mental hold I had a plan to kill myself. I was found with a gun next to me with only 1 bullet and, it was in the chamber. It wasnt a lack of self worth or even a complete feeling of hopelessness. I know I am a loved, valuable member of society, my life would be missed. There are people who would be devastated by my departure but, I feel as though the sooner I'm out of their life the sooner they'll heal. I just dont understand why people should go through the misery of life. Context I also tried to kill myself at 17 and 8. Suicide is something I think about on almost a daily basis. It doesn't matter if its been a great day or bad day. But when it's been some bad days in a row it gets worse. For years I've thought I've had it undercontroll. But it came back in an undeniable way. That's how I ended up In the hospital. I own a couple businesses and had some new businesses go sideways. Barely make money but love it. Recently hit a wall. Had to get money from parent's, friends and family. I couldn't feel worse. I also have bad habits, use recreational drugs, drink and could offer more sacrifices for my success. I know my current circumstances are none but my own fault. I do try to make the best decision for the moment but often forget the future. When I got out of hospitalization I immediately went back to drinking and some of my bad habits; the reality of the shitstorm I'm in the middle of also started to hit me again. I soon started thinking of suicide again. I lie to myself all the time. This time I swore to myself to maintain this blog and, that I cant kill myself unless I'm 3 weeks completely sober minus the drugs I'm prescribed. This will be my journey to sobriety and suicide; or triumph over misery. I guarantee if you stick around you'll see I have one of the craziest lifes ever.

Today, I relapsed. 

I had a panic attack in the car with my mom on my way to see my doctor, because of me remembering the extreme amount of emotional abuse I’ve endured from a friend... and I opened the door while she was driving full speed on the highway (I didn’t throw myself onto the highway, I’m safe), then I just cried and cried and cried and had another panic attack. 

But then I calmed down enough to see my doctor, and my mom and doctor both told me I’m improving a lot and doing really well, and that everyone goes through ups and downs in their treatment so that’s fine.

52,"I just saw something that didn't happen and I'm a little concerned.

An hour ago I was in the kitchen, listening to music and dancing with my 1,5yo while my wife was preparing some breakfast next to us. I've seen her suddenly lift her head from the sandwiches, look to the left and walk out of the kitchen in a hurry. Not thinking much I followed her with my baby still in my arms. We looked for her in the bathroom, then a room next to it, but didn't find her there. She couldn't have climbed the stairs so quickly without me noticing so I was quite confused where'd she go.

I was very surprised when upon returning to the kitchen I found her there serving the breakfast.

""Where did you go?""- I asked

""I was here all the time""- she replied

""No, you were not, I've seen you walk out the door, that's why I followed you.""- I said concerned

""The one who suddenly walked out the door was you, I thought you're just taking Mila for a walk around the house.""- she told me eyeing me suspiciously

I then proceeded to explain her what I saw and she was growing more and more worried as she told me I've seen something that didn't happen.

It's the first time I notice something like that, but can' be sure if it didn't happen before without me realizing.  It was morning, I was sober and rested, a little distracted but not daydreaming. I had a very slight headache but nothing else was unusual.

53,"Hi! So I have a mystery that I haven't been able to pin down for years due to too many overlapping mental health issues that could be causing it (or another issue I haven't been diagnosed for yet.)  


Basically I have this weird phoenomenon I've had as long as I can remember where I randomly replace words with other words that are associated with them, including opposite words. For instance: I might be trying to write ""I love you"" but then i will look up and see things like ""I love I"" or ""I hate you"" or ""we love you"". Or I might think ""I love cats"" but say ""I love dogs"" or ""I love lions"". I might also be saying ""something was broken"", and then write in a different tense ""something is broke"". This happens while typing mostly, but also sometimes while speaking or hand writting. It also gets worse when I'm under stress or discussing stressful topics.

&amp;#x200B;

In the course of an hour of typing (where I see the issue the most), I will make these kinds of little mistakes relatively frequently (about 5-10 or so and probably more that I don't notice). Most of the time I will catch them upon rereading what I typed, but occasionally I'll post something that was a typo and it will sound absolutely horrible. For instance, I sometimes will have a small word replace itself in a text message and then it makes what I'm saying sound like I'm being a horrible person. This has been the area it affects my life most, because over the course of my life I have had a lot of social interactions both in person and over online where a single typo can lead to me loosing relationships or hurting otherwise strong relationships.  


Additionally, this seems to only happen when I am speaking in english. When I program, for instance, the only time I might experience these issues is with variable names. Other than the names I don't seem to have many if any typos in my work.

I'd say there wasn't a single long conversation with an acquaintance where I didn't lie at least once.

56,"My friend (21M) has always had poor mental health. He was abused as a child and has attempted suicide once as a teenager before we met. I know he’s experienced suicidal thoughts a few times while we’ve been friends but he’s never acted on it.

He agreed to get professional help around Christmas time last year. He has been medicated since then for anxiety, depression and psychosis but it doesn’t really seem to help him. He continues to have symptoms like hallucinations, advanced paranoia, insomnia then sleeping all day, deep depressive episodes. Every time he sees his doctor, the dose gets upped.

He recently contacted me to let me know that he’s been feeling very suicidal lately. I asked him if he feels the same as the time he attempted to kill himself and he said that he does.

I let him know that he will always have my support but that I alone cannot pull him out of this. I essentially begged him to talk to his doctor and tell him how he feels. I told him that medication alone cannot fix this and that he needs more advanced treatment. I have told him in the past that I think he would really benefit therapy and I brought it up again in this conversation.

He is currently unemployed and told me that he can’t afford to go to therapy. I tried to explain that there are treatments covered by his healthcare provider and that the doctor will arrange a payment plan for him. He didn’t seem interested in asking his doctor about any of this and told me that everything I was saying was too much for him to read (text conversation) and that he probably wouldn’t bother reading it later either. 

I told him that I wasn’t going to forget about this and that he needed help. That I couldn’t let someone I care about hurt themselves knowing that he can be helped. He apologised for bringing it up and told me he shouldn’t have said anything. I know him and he’s going to try and pretend this never happened.

I believe my friend to be a risk to himself. He has self harmed and attempted suicide in the past. He refuses to speak to his doctor. He was forcibly hospitalised after his previous suicide attempt which is why I believe he doesn’t want to tell anyone about how he feels, out of fear that he’ll be committed again.

I can’t lose him. He may not be able to see it, but the world would be a poorer place without him. I want to help him but I don’t know what to do. If I believed that he had hurt himself or was going to attempt suicide again, I would call emergency services immediately. I don’t care if I’m annoying him, he needs help no matter how it makes him feel toward me.

57,"I’ve been with my husband for 5 years and we have two children together. He is abusive. Each incident that has happened I did my part and went to counselling with him, trying to give him a chance when he said he wanted us to work and he would make the effort to change.

As this goes on I feel myself pulling away from him emotionally and I don’t have that willingness anymore in my heart. He is in the sweet stage now after another rage a few days ago, talks about the books he is reading, and i tell him that’s great but it’s like I’m dead inside. My head tells me “yeah yeah, you’ve heard this before...”

The turning point was last year, when he came home drunk and shoved me into the bed frame. I had a 10cm bruise on my thigh. His sister found out about it and had the hide to tell me it was my fault, I must have provoked him, he wouldn’t hurt a fly, “he’s given you everything you ever wanted”. I was broken after that. In a strange way I don’t understand, that cut worse than his abuse.

So I’m here again, in the honeymoon phase. My heart isn’t in it but I feel like I should be. Leaving is so hard especially with two kids under 3. It’s humiliating. I feel humiliated after what his sister said to me, like I’m scum of society. Like I’m inconveniencing everybody and making it uncomfortable for them. I hate showing my face in social events because it feels so fake. We aren’t happy, it’s embarrassing that people know what we’ve gone through.

I have a fear of eating in front of people, cooking meals for people, hell even just cooking when someone is in the kitchen. I get so nervous that they will either judge me, make fun of what I'm eating or cooking(!?!?!) 
The thought which I'm sure you're gathering might be is that have I made a subconscious fear with food because I associate it with ""giving love/showing love?"" That's why being rejected with things around food hurts me so much?

62,"Greetings. 

  
I have never posted here before. I believe that in order for the readers to grasp my problem, I have to tell you that I live in eastern Europe, outside of EU and that many modern day mental illnesses are, unfortunately, either looked down upon or not considered to be real. I am facing the second of the aforementioned.

I have always had troubles keeping my focus on one single assignment/task. Whether it's something required from me (like school, sitting in the same chair for 45 minutes, which to my mind seem like an eternity of not moving) or something that I am genuinely interested in (like reading books), I just never really was able to involve myself as much as I would really wanted to.  First, I thought I was lazy. Maybe these are thoughts I acquired by listening to my family and/or friends. I don't know. What I do know is that eventually I started to think that I am always the dumbest person in the room. 

Unfortunately, I am aware that that is probably not the case, but yet, despite reason, I still feel as if I am. I can't keep up with my everyday chores (I've been planning on making the bed for the past 4 hours now and I still haven't done it), I always have to force myself into doing things other people seemingly do with ease and even then I often fail to find the motivation to go through with it in the end. I could say for myself that I am a ""thinker"". No, rather an overthinker. It kills me. I literally feel as if I am unable to scratch beneath the surface not because I am not smart enough, but because my brain already switched to another mind flow and is now involved with something else completely. This process occurs numerous times everyday and it can be rather rapid, so I can never focus and pinpoint my thoughts, develop them.

&amp;#x200B;

 Whereas most people have no troubles with engaging in a routine, I always seek and never really find thrill in new things. The only real thing that hasn't changed since my childhood was my enjoyment in gaming. I can do it for 5-6 hours straight and I find it to be my personal drug simply because IT PROVES TO ME that somewhere deep inside I actually truly CAN focus on something, anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I already mentioned, my society does not take me serious and considers me lazy. Even if I am lazy, it does not exclude that I feel as if something is DIFFERENT with my focus when compared to others. I went to a medical doctor and told her that even though I really want to read a book, I can't do it for more than like 20-30 pages after which I read words, but am unable to even connect them into full sentences, yet alone a meaningful text as a whole. She told me that I should stop reading and blatantly laughed. It hurts. It hurts me that I can't even go to a goddamn doctor and get professional assessment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some other traits I would like to mention are my constant fidgeting, never knowing what to do with my hands, rapidly bouncing (like a drummer) my leg, biting lips, etc. 

What I would like of you is to provide me with some literature or documentaries which would help me learn more about ADHD, specifically ADD, and suggest how I can find out whether or not I truly have this disorder. Any advice would be really well taken.

 I hope this post reaches people because I feel as if I am on an empty island sending a message in the bottle with one word letter inside - HELP!!!!",08Jun2019,1
63,"Hi! I am 21 and I am Italian.

Since I am 17 I have been struggling with depression (on and off). My first major depressive episode started few weeks after I started smoking weed daily (in 2015). In 2017 I tried several psychedelics out of curiosity (tripping once a week for two months), and after that period I decided not to use them again because I realized that they were very powerful substances. Last year (2018) was rough for me because in January my mom had a stroke (from which she recovered pretty well), I  had a strange relationship with a girl (it started with me selling her some drugs but soon I realized she was addicted to ketamine), and I abused DMT (I know that I had decided not to take psychedelics again, but I had always wanted to try this one). This drug lasts for 15 minutes, so it was easy to smoke it too often. This is when things started to get strange, because I started to feel pretty ""out there"" in December 2018, until in January 2019 I had my first manic episode. The psychiatrist who visited me said it was a manic episode, but it was a dysphoric experience. I'm going to try to describe it.

It started one night, in the end of January. I noticed that my mind was racing. Thoughts started getting faster and faster. I tried to read a book to calm them down, but I couldn't even read a single sentence without losing track of what I was reading. My attention span lasted few seconds. I couldn't sleep because my mind was so active. It felt very similar to an LSD experience (without hallucinations, even if colors did appear brighter). This lasted for two weeks. I couldn't leave home anymore and had to turn light and sounds down because my senses were heightened and I couldn't stand anything loud or bright without getting irritable. As days went by, I started to think that I had permanently damaged myself. I started connecting many previous events of my life as if they were subtle signals which predicted my insanity. I had never felt so miserable in my life. At the same time, I wasn't depressed. I recognized all the beauty in my life, even if I couldn't enjoy it.

I went to the ER and they gave me bromazepam which did almost nothing (except allowing me to sleep more). I took it only twice. Anyway, after two weeks (early February), my racing thoughts slowly subsided. I started recovering but I became depressed and anxious because I couldn't understand what was going on. I went to a psychiatrist which diagnosed me with bipolar I and prescribed me a medication (valproic acid and sodium valproate). I decided not to take it unless I get another manic episode. I think that drugs and psychological stress may have played a role both in my depressive episodes and in  my manic one. I haven't been using drugs since January and I have been doing fine except for the fact that I am a little bit shocked for what happened to me. What do you think? Is it possible that I don't have bipolar disorder and suffered from a mental breakdown instead?",08Jun2019,0

65,"Apologies in advance – English is not my first language and I’m writing this on my phone. 

Yesterday my best friend and I had a little fight and when talking it out started a conversation about my mental health issues. I have dysthymia, probably had it for over 5 years and am in therapy since about 7 months. I rarely tell my friends when I’m not doing well or feel depressed because I always had the fear that people wouldn’t know what to say or wouldn’t understand why I was feeling sad just because I oftentimes didn’t understand myself. I know that my best friends are there for me and that I can turn to them but it costs me so much effort to open up to someone about certain stuff.
So while both me and my best friend were crying yesterday and talking quite open about stuff she told me that it would help her to know how I’m doing instead of me putting on a mask when in reality things are not going great.

To hear her say this felt like a little relieve and once again showed me that she’s not judging me and truly is a great friend I can turn to.
I hope you also have people in your live that you can turn to. Even tho if it’s rough and difficult to open up it can be such a relieve to talk to your loved ones about your struggles.

Although it was a good and much needed talk she said something that had me thinking all day. She said that sometimes she feels like she can’t talk about her struggles cause in general I’m doing worse. I absolutely don’t think like that and want her to know that she can talk to me about whatever’s on her mind. 

How can I give her the feeling that her problems are valid too and that she doesn’t have to treat me like a raw egg?",08Jun2019,1

when i was younger i was physically and mentally abused by both my mother and my father. my mother would yell and scream at me about how much of a piece of shit i am, and she still does it now. my father used to beat me and a couple years ago he hit my head on the floor. my father has stopped physically abusing me and our relationship finally started to get better right before he went overseas for military reasons about a year ago. i’m glad we were able to improve our relationship, but my mother still tells me how much of a piece of shit i am and how i will never get better. what makes it worse is that i am trans(FTM) and when we get into an argument. she has the audacity to mock me about my gender identity. she doesn’t support me in the first place with my life decisions(though being trans is NOT a choice). it has had a huge impact on my mental health and i took to self harming about 2 years ago. i’ve asked to get therapy but my mother keeps “forgetting” to make appointments and i just keep getting worse. is there anything i can do? i really want out of this situation. i’m 15 and i want to know if there is a way i can get out of this household. i want to be able to dress more masculine and not be ridiculed for wanting to be comfortable i my own skin. i hate hearing the wrong pronouns come out of my own mother’s mouth. it hurts. being called shit constantly makes the pain even worse.

-struggling with dysphoria, anxiety, family issues/abuse
-i live in the US, specifically Florida
-i am trying to convince my mother to get me therapy
-my father is overseas

i’ve always been scared to talk about this because i was never 100% sure if it was abuse. i’m very sorry if abuse was not the right word to use in these situations. i also want to note that from these situations i started to have trust issues, i’m scared of loud noises(from parents yelling, screaming, etc.), and my anxiety worsened. someone did suggest i get in contact with a doctor to explain dysphoria to my mother, and i am working towards that. and if you read through all of this, thank you for listening.",08Jun2019,1

While walking, she began talking about her counseling sessions, this was fairly normal as we often talk about that kind of thing as well as the things in her past that she talked about with her counselor.

Sometimes we even joke saying we're each others therapists for how much she opens up to me about haha

We talked for ages while walking but she suddenly says something along the lines of ""yeah well, I think that's enough depressing stuff, how are you doing?""

I kind of froze, I wanted to speak but couldn't. I just sort of smiled and laughed.

I've been suffering with a few things lately and it just seems to be getting worse. Mainly the suicidal ideations are getting more intense. In fact, just today, I was considering the possibility of me getting drunk and if it would make it easier to end things. So,not nice things at all basically. 

I've been wanting to talk to her about it but it was like I didn't have a voice anymore. I wanted to say something like ""I've kind of been dealing with some stuff a lot lately, just trying to deal with it best I can"" or just anything that could have let her know that I wasn't okay. But instead I just said after a very long moment of me pretending to think ""Aaaaah why is my life so boring!?"" in a humourous manner and we just laughed and started talking about other things.

It's been bothering me a lot because I've been beating myself up saying that I need to tell someone I trust about whats happening to me and there's literally no one I trust more than her.

77,"It makes it severely difficult to work on my anxiety when there's a financial burden overhead that keeps growing. Not working for almost 2 months put me behind and the pay I make would be reasonable if not for the hour long drive.  Makes it difficult to even land a second job. When things keep going wrong (car repairs, previous employer taking inconsistent taxes and now my state is coming for them, etc...) it adds to it and pushes me further into a spiral. The hundreds and hundreds of jobs I've applied for have led to nothing (3 interviews in 5 months) and it's really dragging me mentally down a thorn covered gravel road. There's almost zero chance I won't be snoopy with anyone I interact with anymore. It's becoming a mountain that just won't stop growing steeper and the tools I'm given to climb it aren't designed to take that route. Any other route taken that I can use just allows it all to keep growing and leaves me stuck. At what point do I just give up and accept that life has no upside for me. How do you date when you can't survive paycheck to paycheck?

I’ve been struggling with showing up to important events such as work and school sometimes. It seemed to have stem since my dad passed away when I was 13, I’m 20 now in university. For some reason on random days I just get this strong feeling and use any means possible to convince myself not to go to work that day, or school that day or whatever it may be. I was really bad in highschool but I took an extra year (grade 13) and really seemed to get back on track. I got into university and did great so far.  I just started a new job a little over a month ago and for some reason yesterday morning I got up and I just didn’t go, I called in sick for no real reason.

Mind you this sometimes happens with sports too. 

Does this happen to everyone but they just suck it up and go? I don’t know why I do it sometimes, I enjoy school and sports but I still do this.

I visit a non-profit counseling center for a free session with an old man (like in his 70's), cluttered office packed with stuff given to him from clients. 

He has a Masters in Theology, none of the staff has PhD's. 

The non-profit brochure shows a staff with M.S. &amp; LMFT, LMHC designations.

Non-profits suck. The people I spoke with lied to me and used me as a pawn for my signature to get grant money.

They all know each other in this area too because they refer needy people to each of their ""bogus programs"" for signatures to get grants.

Why can't people be honest and speak the truth? 

Why do they give false hope, and deny my reality?

Its like an addiction to them, they send me on wild goose chases to partnering non-profits who do nothing to find solutions.

They keep people poor, give out stale food from pantries, and vouchers for used clothes.

I talked for an hour in my therapy session, calm and composed but said I am in crisis.

In between he'd say, ""ok"" or ""I don't know anything about that"" or ""you don't seem depressed,"" or ""yes, that's right,"" or ""so what did you come here for?""

My situation is complex. The therapist man agreed. He didn't know what to say. Some people can't admit that there are no solutions to some problems.

It's as though others out there whom I've spoken with who say ""keep trying, dont give up,"" have blind spots and do NOT recognize that when money runs out you do have to stop. 

Some people can never get back to work ever again. Many people are not disabled, but people like to push that disability shit onto me like a drug bc its all they know.

Not everyone is disabled. 

I told the therapist:

""Not everyone who commits suicide and who completes it is mentally ill.""

""For some people who suffer ligitimately due to financial and societal cutoffs, they have two choices:""

* die on the streets due to economic and healthcare deprivation.

Or

*  end their suffering thru their own means via suicide.

People will throw out Medicaid, food stamps, food pantries, shelters, shit jobs, Uber, all the typical data dumping useless ideas,  thinking that the aggrieved person has no brain.

Economic deprivation does not mean intellectual deprivation.

Not everyone can get the income they need (not want but need) to take care of themselves.

Some people will choose to exist in subsistence level poverty, begging for handouts.

Others have lived the best life they could; traveled, worked in careers and obtained all the necessary education only to have aged out of the workforce.

Not everyone has family.

There is nothing left to live for.

I told this very elderly man, that suicide is the best option, I have a burial plot and money left to bury me.

He stood up, said time was up, and ""okay, you can come back and talk if you want to.""

I left. I'm sitting here in my car making out directions with what to do with my body when found.

84,"Background: family gatherings are really tough for me, as I have a lot of unresolved issues with them. Has been like that for almost my whole life, but it has been getting worse with my mental health issue and me trying to open up about it to them. I am walking on eggshells around them and compartimentalise a lot. Plus they have a knack to make me feel guilty about everything. 

I was at my nephews baptism and way trying to be away from people after socializing for a few hours. I went to sit on a swing to be alone. I was already a bit on edge because I spent 2 days with them so far. 

At some point they called me and told me I had to come there and say goodbye to everyone but it just felt too much (my mental health is still pretty unstable even with the meds). I started to get quite a bit of nausea and told them I could not get up right now, and said goodbye from afar.

They the proceeded to tell me I had to come there, and that I was not behaving alright and everything. That sent me spiraling into a panic attack and everything was spinning around me, while the nausea got worse.

A minute later they told me that we had to get up because we were leaving. I said I could not, and they kept calling me and telling me to come on and get up, which made me feel even worse. I was lying on the swing and could not get up, and they were angry because I was making them be late and we had to leave now now now.

At the end my sisters boyfriend came to me and helped me out of the swing and supported me until he got me back to the car.

Now I feel insanely guilty about having had a panic attack with all of them around. I am usually in control around my family and I feel like having had that panic attack means I lost that control.

None of them seems to realise it was panic, they seem to blame it on the sun and such. But I still feel insanely guilty and bad that I broke down.

I feel even worse that when I got to the car, none of my parents asked if I was alright. Think my mother is sulking because I ""acted out"". It took my dad about 15 minutes to ask if I was feeling better. I think it makes me feel even worse because it makes me feel like they don't care about me.

* What could this all mean? Why am I feeling this way?

Hey all.

So, for as long as I can remember, I have always struggled to ""fit in"" with people. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I was hospitalized as a kid for like 11.5 years, accumulated (not exaggerating) and I wasn't really exposed to a lot of socializing. Maybe it has to do with the friends that I did make ended up dying. So many of my friends and people I cared about died. They were regulars, and seeing them go from being upbeat and positive about life and then reduced to skin and bones and literally drowning in their own mucus really got to me.

The friends I did end up making beyond the hospital used  me. They told me this--they only use me for my videogames, my pool, etc. I was told this in 7th grade. I've always had trouble making friends/keeping friends. I've become flakey,  apathetic, and all-around feel like I don't fit in anywhere.

I tried going to school for psychology/biology. That didn't work out--I got bored. I did well when I really applied myself (got B+ in computer science, all 100s on my labs), did really well in philosophy, but I didn't do anything with them. I just got bored, and moved on to the career I am in right now.

And it doesn't matter what career I am in, that sense of not fitting in with the career choice will not disappear. If I was a nurse, I would start questioning if I could really handle it. If I was a retail associate, I would question why I was in this when I knew that, intellectually, I was capable of doing better. If I was in bookkeeping, I would question why I am wasting time adding up and keeping track of numbers that are meaningless to me.

It doesn't matter. I just don't feel like I fit in, but I feel like, overall, my choice is right for me. I did really well in programming (high 80s/90s when I really applied myself and had enough concentration power to devote). When a depression spell took me, I failed.

But now I am in a career. And my depression waxes and wanes. One moment, I feel great--like everything is working out fine. But then when I start feeling fine, I begin to ruminate on minor mistakes that I have made, and I completely hyperbolize the impact of it in my brain. For ex, coworker raised his voice at me, I thought I was going to get fired. The next day, he was buddy buddy again. Another ex, one of our group members said ""Do you have 15 minutes that we can chat tomorrow? I need to run some things by you"", and my mind went immediately for ""She is going to kick me off of the group because I am not competent."" but it ended up being that she handed me even more responsibilities.

88,"**I am safe. I am not at immediate risk**

I suffer depression but can't use antidepressants due to health issues and therapy has been no help at all. My depression is 'high-functioning' so I don't stay in bed all day, it just means I exist and sometimes I get a really low mood, I experience suicidal ideation daily but most of the time it's just thinking and rarely am I actively suicidal.

Therapists sometimes ask me how I deal with being suicidal, I don't know I just do - I mean, what's the alternative? Death. It honestly feels like because I don't try to kill myself they decide I don't need any help to deal with suicidal ideation.

The typical advice is call a suicide hotline but they just give cookie cutter responses so don't actually help. I have no friends or family either. 

In terms of my depression things like exercise, meditation, etc. doesn't help. I need very real practical things to change my life in order for my depression to be dealt with, unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any suitable support for me. 

I need some sort of way of pulling myself out of low moods and from committing suicide.",08Jun2019,3

Hello guys, 
I live a happy life and I am a very optimistic person, but every time this happens I get depressed. 
When I see or meet a girl and I like her then my life gets a mess.
Then I just get tired, depressed and obsessed with this girl so easily. 
I can’t stop thinking about her and I am a big overthinker so I get
really tired about myself.
When I forget this girl after a few weeks or months then my life is good again. 
But I have got this problem like 4-5 times and when I see a new girl I like it just
Happens again. 
Just two times I actually asked that girl out but got rejected two times. 

 And yes, last year a met a girl from my local gaming community. She was pretty when I met
Her but I had no feelings for her back then but I developed them over time. I don’t know her
Very well and she is just being friendly. Today she again showed up at our meeting and I have had a great day. 
I just don’t know every time this situation happens what I need to do. 
I get confused and really depressed I like a girl but it would lead to anything. 

How can I avoid or help these situations?",08Jun2019,0

Or that one friend that really likes to push your buttons and aggravate you. Maybe that one friend who is always there for you, but in their anger they take it out on you. You can try to be there for people because you feel like they need it, but sometines the best thing to do with toxic friends (even if they have a mental health issue) is to cut them off. Dont be ashamed of cutting off people that are detrimental to your health. Your health is your wealth, and don't dare let anybody step on that. Friends that downplay your feelings so it feels that it doesnt matter, or only make their anger and pain matter, simply are not worth it. You deserve friends that come over, smoke you out when you don't ask for it, take you out and make you feel good, hell even if all they want to do is talk, those are the friends that are worth it. Friends that actually take time when they can to be a real friend. You can try as hard as you want, but if they aren't actively working to better their own toxicity, honey, it's time to move on. You're worth more than that. Sorry, had to let this out because had an issue recently with someone.

I've never really put any thought into how that might affect my mental health and/or how I approach relationships, always living under the assumption that it didn't really affect me all that much outside of simply being upset about losing my father.  Recently I have become aware that this might not be the case after having heard something regarding mental illnesses I struggle with being related to the loss of a parent at a young age.  I find that looking for the source of an issue makes it easier to address or cope with, so I am just wondering what mental health issues are common for people who lost their parents at a young age so I can be paying special attention to symptoms of those in myself.",08Jun2019,0
99,"Her name was Angela. I was in 11th grade when I found out she killed herself with a gun. I had just gotten home from my cousins Bar Mitzvah, she had apparently killed herself the night before but my Dad did not want to tell me until after this fun occassion was over as to not ruin my time (my Dad found out from our family friend which was Angela's step father). I remember coming home and hearing the tremble and trepidation in my dad's voice as he told me. I remember completely breaking down and feeling this shattering despaired feeling in my chest and falling onto my couch sobbing and yelling. We did not have any mutual friends because she lived in another state, but our families made the commute almost every weekend during the winter time so we would be able to see each other. I remember traveling to go to her wake and having a giant line outside the building for people coming to condole the family. I remember seeing her mom completely collapse with grief, no not even that, something stronger and more heartbreaking. Her mom's screams and sobs still echo in my mind whenever I think about it or get reminded from watching crime shows. Angela was the first person in my life that had died. In the years since I have lost 4 family members, and recently found out an old middle school friend also committed suicide.  Yet, when I think about other people I lost, I am sad and I miss them, but the feeling does not unhinge me. When I think about Angela, I want to cry. I get so down and my heart breaks everytime I think about her. My parents don't understand why it bothers me so much, expecially after 7 years, or why it affects me more than another family member I lost. I can't answer them. Maybe it is because with the other family members deaths I could easily picture their last moments and that brings my closure (3 were old age/dementia , and one from battling cancer). But with Angela, there are a lot of possibilites of how she did, if she suffered, if it was quick, how gruesome it would be. I keep imagining what it was like for her mom to find her, expecially after having her moms reaction at the funeral in my head. I feel like I keep retraumatizing myself everytime I think about it. I miss her. I wish that when I think about her I don't get this deep feeling of despair anymore and I could function better.

100,"I was diagnosed with trauma about half a year ago. I didn't at the time have it in me to talk to my counsellor about all the other things that plagued me. I'm going to ask now because earlier today I realised that that could only be the stem.

To put it simply, I went to my counsellor suspecting I had depression. Ended up with the above diagnosis. The counsellor wanted to refer me to real therapist but I never visited her again after that because I was scared.

What I've tried and failed to mention to her are the voices in my head and the incredibly detailed and reoccurring images in my mind. I, of course, wanted to just live with it. That is, until today.

I've realised that I have major gaps in my memory. I completely don't remember anything that happened in the year of 2013. It's not fuzzy or anything. It's more like I've never lived it. There is nothing there, nothing that relates to that year. Supposedly, I had a bad injury that year. But I don't remember anything about it. Didn't help that there's no mark once it was apparently internal. I would usually not worry about these thing because I'm chronically forgetful(not really because events are usually crystal clear but I do forget a lot of things like important work and dates and things to bring etc). But a whole year seems suspicious. Especially when I can remember small things back till age 4-5.

106,"Okay so i did a tiny overdose on some anti anxiety pills yesterday which also apparently make you sleepy (the pill can help insomniacs so I suppose they’re sleeping pills too right?)

anyway so I found out how sleeping pills can kill you more peacefully than other pills and whatever- but yeah to get to the point, I purposely took 7 at once when you’re supposed to take 1 or 2 a day. YES obviously I know 7 is not enough to kill myself, I’m fully aware of that. 

I took them as I wanted to just sleep for a whole day or so - instead I slept the same amount of time I usually do? It’s weird cause after an hour of taking them and feeling a bit woozy from them, I felt pretty much normal the rest of the night and today.

I suppose I’m just a little confused why I didn’t sleep longer. The drug is called “Passion flower” it’s the only drug in the house that I’m able to get to as mum doesn’t trust me with any other drugs. I think that’s because Passion flower is more herbal so far less dangerous if you do overdose on them? 

Actually, because it’s like herbal stuff, even if I took the whole packet it wouldn’t kill me would it? Because herbal stuff can’t kill you can it? Not that I want to overdose to kill myself I’m just curious 

I’m genuinely curious, would I die from taking the whole packet (20 pills) of it or not? Surely any pill can be dangerous if you take excessive amounts of it. I’m not planning to die but if I am going to in the future, I don’t want to waste my time and money taking something that wouldn’t even harm a fly

110,"Hi!

I recently completed my first year of college and, towards the end of the academic year, classes and assignments really started to stress me out (there were lots of other factors too - its been fairly crazy). When this stress and anxiety got too intense, I got a severe UTI accompanied by body aches, abdominal pain, and headaches. I also missed two periods in a row. The physical symptoms stressed me out more (my mind always jumps to the worst explanation...like cancer or some other fatal ailment), which made the physical symptoms worse. It's really a vicious cycle. 

Just as the year ended, and my stress was finally beginning to subside along with my physical symptoms, my dad and my aunt got into a massive fight. This fight meant a lot of bad things for my family and for a trip that my friends and   
I had planned (that we couldn't get money back on), and I got super stressed out again. This time, the abdominal pain came back worse than it had been before, along with my other symptoms, and I came down with a fever on top of it. And again, I started stressing about my health, which made everything that much worse.

The fight sorted itself out, and there's no issue anymore, so my stress and anxiety is beginning to subside again, thankfully. But how can I prevent this from happening again? It miserable, and quite scary to be honest. I was sick for a third of my freshman year because of it, and really don't want to repeat that until I graduate.

To give some backstory on my situation I guess, I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for a few years now. Lately my job has become *incredibly* stressful. I've been contemplating suicide for months, and every morning I wake up sobbing, dreading going there. I've broken down crying there on several occasions, and on others I've just completely blanked out and disassociated to the point I don't know what's happening sometimes. I have been trying to look for alternative work, but everything is so soul crushing and I've had no luck. I live with my parents (i'm doing my best to save up to move out but between me and my partner's own pretty abusive situation it's really hard for us to save, and we can't afford anything currently), and to be honest my  Father is very emotionally manipulative and abusive. He's draining to be around, constantly belittles me and everything I do, is very homophobic, doesn't have a job so me and my sibling are forced to pay a lot of our wage just to have a place to live, and is basically the cause of a lot of my anxiety. He's done some other bad things I don't really want to get into. 

Basically lately, I don't know whats been happening to me. I'm used to how I usually am with my mental illness, but this seems to be a whole new level. I'm barely sleeping, and when I do it's incredibly vivid and strange- often nightmares. I'll wake up to sort of sleep paralysis type strange things, like blood on my walls, or hair growing across the ceiling. Just the other week I dozed off and within ten minutes woke up screaming that I didn't know where I was, feeling like I was drowning, and scared my girlfriend a lot. I apparently threw myself across the bed and started bawling and screaming and couldn't calm down. I don't really remember it, just the sensation of being unable to breathe. Just after that thought, I started freaking out because I felt like I was being watched and someone was there, it scared me so badly I started crying again, but nothing was there, and I was wide awake. Again today, something similar happened. My girlfriend was patting my hair and we were just chatting and suddenly I had this sense of utter panic, asked her to stop and then just. Broke down. I couldn't stop sobbing and I kept feeling like something was there to hurt me, like there was another presence in the room, like I could see something after me in the corners of my vision. I've never felt such fear in my life. 

I know that's not normal at all. It's terrifying, and I'm scared of telling anyone what's going on because it sounds so outlandish. My girlfriend knows a little but I've been telling her it's just nightmares and stress but I really don't know what's happening. I'm so frightened and don't know where to turn, what this could be, if I'm just being dramatic.

114,"Hi! 

So I’m an incoming freshman in college and this summer my partner and I want to make a story based game on people with depression and what bystanders should do to help close ones with depression for a summer project. 

The game is text based where people choose different paths that can lead to different endings (similar to Walking Dead and Life is Strange). The choices that the players choose could lead to “good” endings and “bad” endings. The main objective of the game is to teach what exactly depression is, signs of it, and what to ideally do when a close one has depression. 

What will be mainly important from this project is not only teaching about depression, but also to present data of what is the most common choices that people made and what choices have others have deviated on, opening a discussion of what the data could mean. 

The biggest problem with this project is that my and I have little knowledge of depression and how it affects people’s lives; we also want to create a respectful story that helps put a light on mental health that takes depression seriously, so we want to try our best to keep the story as accurate as possible. 

So that being said, if a game were to be based on depression, what would be needed to be shown in the game? What misconceptions should we not touch on in the game? And lastly, what can someone do if their loved one has depression?

116,"Throwaway account but I’ve talked about these issues in the past so it’s not like I’m good at hiding.

I’m a 15 year old boy with anxiety, HOCD, and ADHD. Lately I’ve been going through some depressive symptoms as well as some anxiety attacks due to remembering some trauma I have. 

A lot happened back then. 

Basically, I was catfished during the summer of 2018. The person who catfished me tried to manipulate me and was extremely abusive.  They also tried to change my sexuality which failed(because that’s impossible. But since this is a big part of the anxiety).

And another thing that ended about a year ago was a situation I had with someone who used to be a female friend. They falsely accused me of sexual harassment and she really hurt me. This happened during the school year before the summer of when I was catfished.

Anyway, at the time, one of my favorite movies was “Thor: Ragnarok” and this is around the time I started getting into comics as I’m a huge comics fan.

So, just today I started watching “Thor: Ragnarok”; however, that sparked memories of the catfished and it started making me feel regressed. Every body sensation, how I felt in my own body, everything came back. I actually felt regressed one year back and  then I’ve felt that way all day. I also felt super disassociative today.

I also kept accidentally typing this in the past tense while typing this as if I was talking about one year ago. Maybe it was something else doing this. Idk :(. Now I’m worried that I’m putting the past into today by saying it in the present tense. Idk what’s going on. I’m super super scared :( :( :( :( :(.

I liked one of my best friends and so did she at the time, but I got really jealous and clingy and manipulative and hurt her and other people I cared about. I got a wake up call and started changing myself.

G, the girl I liked, blocked me out of her life for a while, but our friend A stood by my side and was one of the reasons I changed and she was there for me. After two months of G being gone she all of a sudden came back to be my friend in about November. She said she was still mad at me but still loved me. She unblocked me everywhere and things seemed normal. I did tell her I was still working on my apology. 

About the near end of April, our school band posted about an interest meet. It was something I really wanted to join along with G and A and our other friend groups. When I was asking A questions about the meet, she said she wanted it to just be her, G, and our/their friend J. This made me feel excluded and I knew if I went to the meet that night, I’d have a breakdown and possibly even go back to my old ways. So I did the best thing and stood home and tried calming myself. After that I started noticing that G hadn’t seen my story posts lately. I assumed maybe she’s going through something or is taking a social media break. I didn’t think much of it, not like I used to. 
(I found out later that they had already started rehearsing for the auditions that I WANTED TO DO TOO. A told me if I joined the team for band, then G would drop out. I ran all types of scenarios in my head if I joined, so I just backed out. Part of me felt like it was a way to get me out. It hurts so much when I see them all together doing something I wanted to do with them together.... they get to bond even more but I don’t...)

I talked to a teacher about joining the school paper and I asked A if she could ask G if she wanted to join. A said that she knew her answer would be no. Then it kinda hit me: I checked her insta account and her tumblr account and saw she blocked me again. I was so confused and so anxious wondering why when I didn’t do anything this time. A said I didn’t do anything and when I asked why she blocked me again (keep in mind I wasn’t pissed but very confused and a bit sad), she said she couldn’t say. I was being kept in the dark mostly. I said “Why would she come back if she were just going to leave again?” 

A said “You didn’t give her a choice.” This pissed me off but I didn’t show it. I didn’t do anything manipulative to her over the last 6 months and even before when she blocked me. I kept my space, I changed my mindset, I did everything in my power to be a better person, but it’s my fault she came back into my life? That just didn’t even make sense. A said how she stood by her best friend/sister, but why didn’t she decide that ages ago? What changed now? They don’t even tell me.

Anyway, A also mentioned that our friend group was talking about kicking me out. And this gave me even more anxiety. I found it funny how later they’re deciding this shit now. I asked my best friend H some stuff and he said G realized I have her intense anxiety. I don’t know her feelings, and I guess I could understand it, but at the same time I don’t. For this entire time of six months, what have I done, or what makes me give her anxiety? I’d genuinely like to know tbh. 

A stayed my friend for a few weeks more before she blocked me, but in that time I noticed some off things with her. First of all, when I left my class one day, I saw her and G in the hallway. When they saw me they immediately ran away from me and were smiling and laughing for some reason. This hurt me. A was still my “friend” but just ran away from me like I’m some monster. Like I’m the bad guy. It just made me feel so bad. Second, she stopped coming to the east side of the school for lunch. Trust me, I knew she was avoiding me, but I told myself “Maybe there was some people she wanted to see.” Whenever I asked if she would eat with me and my friend, she made some excuse ig? And third, she muted my story too. Basically, she faked her friendship with me until she was ready to drop me too. I didn’t respect that. I’m not stupid. Just say it to my face and be honest. Being faked hurts even more. 

All in all, i hate most of this. This whole situation is something I think about everyday as well as my regret. I know I’ve come a long way to change, but I hate there was no closure. No honesty. Nothing. I was just kept in the dark. It felt like being pulled on a leash. One moment I’m out of your life, the next I am, the next I’m not with no explanation or common reason this time as well as all the other stuff.

I wanna tell my friend H how I feel on all this but I know how he feels about the whole thing. I feel like if I say something he’ll think my feelings don’t matter because I wasn’t this victim. 

One friend I expressed this to said I’m the victim this time, G and A at this point are just being very immature. That it’s good that I want to try bringing closure and actually giving my apologies out since they don’t want to. 

What do you think I should do? I know I should move on, but since were in band and have a whole camp and marching season ahead of us I know I’m going to have so many breakdowns and such. 

Am I the victim this time? Do I deserve this? Am I doing the right thing? Tell me what you think. Give me some advice. It puts me in a, as people call it now, “dark place.” Because I hate all of this and I hate myself and honestly I feel so guilty and I can’t take the pain anymore.",08Jun2019,1
118,"I (F25) have experienced some childhood trauma as well as I was raped when I was 21. I can't talk about anything to do with my past or I just start bawling. I'm not trying to be dramatic when I do it, it's just I've never had an appropriate outlet to really let all the things I held onto out. So the even slightest mention of anything I turn into a puddle. I know this isn't healthy for me or any relationships I intend to have. 
So I told my mom I want to see a therapist. She asked if I felt like I need medication (she also has anxiety and is medicated). I told her if it was decided it would be necessary then I would try it. I feel like it's possible the therapy alone, actually being able to unseal all these works of my past, could be the real key for me. Not a cure all I'm sure, but at least I could maybe get to a place where it doesn't rule over me. 
Wish me luck as I have a consultation this week. I would like to post an update in the future to let you all know how my progress is.",08Jun2019,11

120,"I'm well and truly in an extremely bad place in my life, I feel I have no one to talk to. Every action I do brings me cringe attacks; I've never felt so alone in my entire life. I literally do the most to get someone to notice I'm in pain, but they just don't seem to realise... Even if I say it clear as day. I don't want to die, I just really don't want to be alive. I'm feeling trapped and suffocated. I want to run away but it's not an option and Its not a good idea to do. I've been to numerous counsellors but they do not get me, I just have so many problems, they don't even know where to start... Even they don't take me seriously but I cannot keep living like this.

121,"Sorry for the long post and potential mistakes with my grammar, I’m dyslexic. Please understand I am only speaking for myself here and I really want to learn and know more about other peoples experience within their countries system. 

If there’s anything that I’ve noticed from my experience in the mental health system, they absolutely rushed the gun with getting to a diagnosis and pumping medication to close the case. But in my experience, none of it helped, the medication effected my heart rate, weight and (waiting on scans) may have even caused permanent damage to my liver. The meds made me numb, robotic and emotionless. My girlfriend (at the time) didn’t how to react because I wasn’t myself, I was worse in fact but just really boring / ‘brain dead’. 

If there’s anything that truly helped it was taking a break from everything and focusing on positive changes for myself. Work on things that intrinsically motivated me and staying away from negative values (buying new clothes, social media, drugs / drinking, toxic people and environments). Basically a complete change in lifestyle. I realized that once I felt more comfortable with myself (still anxieties and panic attacks), it was about nose diving into new experiences, if I didn’t like them, I’d just leave, it’s no loss to me, at the time it couldn’t really get any worse and I made conscious decision not to regret something I deliberately pulled away from, started to really take the whole responsibility for my actions approach a lot more seriously. 

I have a list of traumatic experiences when i was younger that lead me to drug addictions and ended being in a toxic relationship where I was gaslighted to point of nearly losing my sanity. I wasn’t legally ticking the boxes for the meds he put me on but the doctors heard all of this and jumped straight into antipsychotic medication, when after discussing with a solicitor, was done prematurely. I was baffled but I realized I didn’t really have a choice at the time. I went with them and well, you’ve heard the rest. I understand I’m predominantly speaking from my own opinion on this and completely understand if someone is having hallucinations, undiagnosed disorders from an early age or has already attempted to take their life, the red flags are there so the doctors are forced to act as quickly as possible (sometimes even mildly aggressively). I guess I’m basically saying that finding your own comfort zone, even if it’s just one person and working on gaining new experiences to change my perspective and perception on matters, it helped so much more than a pill. Just clarify I was being treated for Depression with Delusional Disorder but myself and my parents have arguing against this. Being able to actually self reflect and change perception and grow as a person really helped me than anything the care I was given. I’m really interested to hear anyone else’s experiences on this or if they’ve ever found articles that go with or against my point. With the stigma surrounding mental health I kinda feel a discussion about experiences in care could be beneficial towards developing a better understanding on the alarming increase in mental health cases.

The purpose of this submission isn’t to put down the health care system, they do save lives, but the media can’t use that as a headline. I’m genuinely just looking for peoples opinions and If you are having suicidal thoughts and ever need help, seek help.",08Jun2019,1

Created a throwaway account for this.

My 40 year old daughter has been through a lot, has ptsd, social anxiety, clinical depression, yet deep down has a good soul.
She was in an 8 year abusive lesbian relationship. She was able to end it with help from a Women's Center and her own willpower.
She's moved back home a couple years ago.
Recently she reconnected with an ex girlfriend of hers, hoping for a friend.
My daughter is not very assertive, she tends to go directly to anger, yet has the insight to know her anger is based on hurt.

The ex-girlfriend she saw for over a month, she won't talk much about it other than to say the ex (who has her own extreme mental problems) led her on out of revenge (they dated a decade ago). 
My daughter just wishes to be friends and is upset about putting her heart on the line for her ex, who doesn't care.
Apparently the ex of my daughter is so codependant upon her mother it's unhealthy, as she's unable to live her own live autonomously.
My daughter is at her wits end over all this, she doesn't care if she lives or dies. She's mad at herself for not being assertive enough to tell her ex she wanted to take things slowly. (Apparently her ex has low self esteem and my daughter didn't want to upset the applecart any). She is also desperate for friends.
At any mention of impatient, my daughter goes off and I'm afraud for the worst or she will take off. She's suffered trauma in inpatient mental health settings before.
She goes from being extremely angry at her ex (who is not ready for any relationship until she can seperate herself from her mother, imo) to indifferent.

It seems a constant battle that cannot be won. At 40 years old, my daughter has nothing to live fir aside from her pets. Yet i fear that will only last so long.

She was doing a lot better while dating her recent ex, yet since that relationship hit the fan, she can barely function day to day.

It's a lot of details to get into, I'm not comfortable sharing them all on the net.

What can i do to help my daughter? She's been through over 20 years of therapy, has no hope.

At least with her ex, they were able to bond over pets, similar mental illness. I've not seen her that happy in years.

She told me she's laid out her heart on the line for this girl, who she claims could care less, took her for granted and is just following what her enabling mother telks her- I'm qouting my daughter.

I've a fear things will get worse. 
Can anyone recommend anything that would help? My daughter has clinical depression, gave an ex a second chance and it has semmed to only trigger her.
She will refuse inpatient at any costs, even her life. She really has no life, she just doesn't care.

She told me i was a bad mother for not caring as her ex-girlfriend's mother sided with her ex. (Reason why they shouldn't be together).

My daughter is a ticking time bomb. I'm unsure how to help her. 

Any advice is appreciated, yes I've checked into NAMI and all that.",08Jun2019,1
124,"I get no enjoyment from life. I have no friends, no social skills, no job prospects, no possibility of being in a relationship. I go to work, feel miserable, come home, sleep and repeat.

125,"So, I'm new to Reddit. And the accepting I have a problem thing. (I've got Asperger's Syndrome).

But, I think I'm starting to develop an actual problem. 

My last breakup involved me being told I'm going bald, too fat and going nowhere. 

My life since, has been constantly striving to get into shape, mostly, my upper body. 

But I'm not sure that has been the reason for a long time. 

I went from 100 kilos (220 pounds) to 81 kilos (178 pounds) in about 6 months. And I was happy. 

But it didn't stop there. I want my upper body bigger (my legs are already huge, when I was playing rugby I could squat 210kg) but I'm constantly terrified I look fat. 

I've got this issue where I put on weight, and my arms look bigger, then I starve myself to make my stomach tighter, but I've never managed both at the same time, and I'm worried I'm doing myself damage, I don't know if I've got a problem, or if I'm just compulsive. But I feel dirty if I eat, and dirty if I don't work out at least 4 times per week. 

Just want to know if anybody else has a similar scenario, and what their advice is. What I can do?

My mom is one of my favorite people in the world, and I’ve almost never been hurt by her words. People do have it way way way worse than me. And I know I’m being irrational. But now I feel like I can’t tell her the silly things that make super self-conscious, upset, or worried.

So I don’t know what to do with that now. I do all the stuff I’m supposed to do, I meditate daily, I work out, go to therapy, and take my medication... and I thought I was getting better but I still can’t cope with stress. I can hardly even recognize when it occurs.",08Jun2019,1

136,"Essentially what the title says.

I'm 29 years old and have had the worst mental relapse since I was 18. 

I've been self-harming again and am struggling more and more to keep the intrusive thoughts away.
I feel like a failure. I cut again for the first time in ten years. 

On the outside, things are great. Successful, handsome husband. Twin baby girls, only a few months old. I work part time with abused animals. I've just graduated my college course with all distinctions. 

I'm known in our area for always smiling and being happy. I'm very involved in our community. I'm ridiculously good at hiding this. I've been burying it since our babies were born but lately it's gone from manageable ""blue days"" to pure hopelessness and terror.

Things should be perfect. I have a good life when so many others are suffering for legitimate reasons.
Instead, I lie in bed on the nights my husband is working the late shift and I cry and cry, hoping I won't wake up. 

I either feel nothing at all or else pure cold despair. I don't actively want to kill myself but I daydream about being hit by a car, or having an aneurysm, anything. 

I'm a coward, I can't even bring up the courage to kill myself. 

I worry I'll be a shit mother to our girls. I love them more than anything but I feel if my mental problems are returning, they, and my husband, would be better off without me. 

My husband was not with me when I last had severe mental issues and I don't think it's fair for me to inflict this on him.

I have a history of physical, mental and sexual abuse from an ex partner when I was 15-17 and I never got help for it. And now I'm scared to because it was so long ago that I feel I have no right to complain about it now. 

Every day I'm trying to think of reasons to keep going and every day, my mind shoots those positive thoughts down.

I'm lost and I am terrified at what I am capable of. My mind is sinking to deeper and darker thoughts, thankfully nothing like harming my family, it's only things like me ""falling"" down the stairs and dying or being stabbed and killed by someone if I am out jogging. 

I am scared of myself and I don't know how to handle this suffocating fear.

Tldr-: don't want to kill myself but I wouldn't mind dying.",08Jun2019,2
