0," TL;DR Although I didn't want it to happen, ask for it or anything like that, it is my responsibility to live with the aftermath, go through the recovery process and ultimately move on.

  
I wrote [this](https://medium.com/invisible-illness/the-hardest-truth-of-childhood-trauma-584e1f426061) blog post a week ago, and have had a lot of positive feedback about it, so I wanted to share it with you all. In it I talk about what happened to me, how I was impacted and ultimately how I moved towards recovery and acceptance.

My experience is of course my own, but for me at least, when I realised that it was on me to heal and that anger/blame/resentment was counterproductive to that healing, I was actually able to make some real progress. At my worst I was suicidal, self harming and struggling with addictions.  


I want to make it clear that nobody deserves trauma in any manner. However when it happens, the victim needs to take actions to help themselves (see the therapists, do self care, exercise etc etc), because hoping the the perpetrator will fix everything is folly. Whilst anger, rages, resentment and sadness towards them feels sadistically satisfying, it too has little ability to heal (particularly if it is the only actions taken down that path).",04Feb2019,1
1,"I have an appointment with a therapist after seeing my doctor and he was somewhat confused when I told him that. He let me know other disorders I have but he said he wasnt too sure about the lacking of emotions that I imitate them because I just cant feel them.

It's just something I have done for a long time.  For example, I sense the mood in the room is happy. I tweak my cheeks higher, raise my eyebrows and smile. If someone is telling a joke you widen your mouth, squinch your eyes, and let out laughter. There is a little more then that but I just dont feel it. It is such a chore to imitate it. Sometimes I misread the mood and look like a complete fool which makes things worse.",04Feb2019,1

4,"Hi everyone, I’m posting because we (my husband and I) need some advice on a sensitive family situation. 

Husband’s grandmother (we will call her Grams) and husbands mother (we will just call her mom) live together. 

Some back ground: Mom was involved in a serious car accident when he was a baby which caused the onset of schizophrenia. she was diagnosed while my husband was young and was medicated for a short time but does not take anything currently. She actually is coping quite well and my husband has said that she has actually improved over the years. My husband used to live with both of them before we got married and they’ve both been in rather good health.

Grams is a physically healthy (as far as we know) 69 year old who has over the past 5 years or so started to isolate herself and become a hermit.

She was an avid church-goer and had a nice circle of friends there as well, but started withdrawing from church at around the time my husband and I got married. She started just not going to a few functions and then stopped cold turkey. She claimed that she stopped going because it was too political and that people at the church were in cahoots with her employers and that they didn’t like they way she was doing her job, so that was that. Then she started saying that people were trying to run her off the road on her way to and from work. Long story short she eventually retired from her job as well because it progressed to the point where my husband was begging her just to quit so that (he hoped) these perceived delusions would go away. So now she stays home with his mother and never drives or leaves the house unless she comes to our house. She stopped answering the phone for her church friends and they stopped coming by to see her because they didn’t feel welcome.

I tell you all this because over the past few years she’s slowly gotten worse. My husband goes to see her twice a day to check on her and his mom and we always see her on the weekends. She’s now saying that she believes there is an electric current that is running through the house and makes her body feel like its buzzing, and generally makes her feel sick. Some days are worse than others but she doesn’t feel this “electric river” (as she calls it) when she leaves the house or when she’s at our house, but feels it intermittently at her own house. She’s told us many theories as to what is causing this electric river from it being the WiFi to the water company in our town placing some sort of special pipe under ground. My husband has urged her to go to the doctor to make sure there’s nothing else going on and she flat out refuses and says that they won’t believe her and that doctors just try to “put old people down.” As in, they are going to kill her. 

The electric river thing has gotten so out of hand that we gifted Mom a wooden tea box that I hand painted for her, for her birthday and Grams is claiming she can feel it buzzing and won’t sleep at night. Mom told my husband that she was going to have to throw out the tea box or give it back to us because Grams is driving her crazy getting up and down all night and saying things about it. My husband again urged her to go get checked out and she won’t.

We don’t know what to do. She has isolated herself completely, will not leave her house unless she’s coming to our house, and the “electric river” business is getting way out of hand. We are concerned for her as well as Mom who lives with her, but we don’t know what to do since she refuses to go to a doctor and is even afraid of them. 

I’m obviously not a doctor, but I am under the impression that her issues are probably more mental than anything else but she, again, would never agree to see a professional.

Does anyone have any ideas as to what we can do? 

I’m just at a loss and my husband is worried sick and I don’t know how to help. 

Thanks for reading",04Feb2019,1
5,"I’ve never been diagnosed with any sort of learning disability or anything like that. No dyslexia, ADHD, autism, etc. But I’m finding that it’s getting harder for me to form sentences. It’s mostly when I’m just speaking. I know what I’m trying to say but I just can’t get the words to come together. If I try to go too fast then what I’m saying can be like 5 topics in one sentence and it’s really fucking frustrating. It’s even getting hard just to ask my teacher if I can use the bathroom. I know, I’m fucking idiot. I usually just try to avoid talking, which makes people think that something’s wrong with me. This has only been coming on for a few months now.

6,"I won’t reveal too much information about myself however, what I can say is that I suffer from several mental illnesses. Because of these, I have an IEP (individualized education program) which means I am given more attention in school by physiologists and teachers. These people are supposed to be trained in dealing with mentally ill or disabled children and for the most part they have been. Until this year. I’m a sophomore in high school and because of a manic episode I had freshmen year, I was placed in a program for mentally ill teenagers. The three main counselors are to put it nicely extremely rude and insensitive. I hadn’t seen this before (if you don’t count kids peace) and I was shocked at the way they treated me. For instance, when I suffered a panic attack. the counselors got closer and started to invade my personal space. For those who know about mental illnesses, the one thing you’re NEVER supposed to do when someone is having a panic attack is to invade their personal space. This went on for around 20 to 30 minutes. What happened next was absolutely unacceptable. One of the counselors  started calling me autistic. I happen to not be autistic. She kept insisting that I had autism; even when I showed her my IEP she wasn’t even sorry. I have been called this throughout my entire life mostly by kids and parents but never a teacher let alone a counselor. Someone who is supposed to help you  feel safe and comfortable would never call you autistic. An it’s not just me, they act this way to all of the students in the program, they will talk down to some as if they’re mentally challenged, force a student to do something they don’t want to do, and grilling students to the point of tears. I had told my parents about the situation and they were infuriated. I wanted to get this message out because people who struggle with mental illness should not be treated in this manner. Have any of you ever experienced an event like this? If so, comment your story.",04Feb2019,1

8,"I recently got a job promotion, one step closer to my dream job. 

I've worked for the same company for 2 years and got the promotion pretty much on my 2 year anniversary. When my Managers asked all the other staff who they would like to replace the previous manager, they all picked me; makes you feel good.

Fast forward to about a week into the promotion, I feel like I'm in to deep. Everyone is expecting me to be this superstar manager, but I feel like if I make the tiniest mistake I'm letting them down. I also feel like I ask stupid questions, and repetitive questions as I have a learning disability (they dont know) in which it takes me longer to learn things than most people.

9,"Gonna start off by saying I’m completely fine and have no intention on harming myself. Just, I have no idea how to make myself better that is actually possible for me. 

I’m probably just going to ramble on because I have nobody to express my thoughts to. 

Death is terrifying to me. Like, I don’t believe in god. I wish I did. I wish I believed that we go to heaven or hell. But I’ve had doubts about it my whole life. Even as a kid going to church. Now for myself, I know for a fact that I don’t believe. To me, dying will be just rotting in the ground. But what about mentally? In Christianity your physical body rots but your mind goes to heaven or hell. But what if you’re just trapped in your own mind for all eternity? What if you never really die, your body just stops working? What if your consciousness knows you’re buried 6 feet under? Or what if you’re cremated? What if you’re still conscious when you’re burned? What if you can feel it? Then what if you’re still conscious as a jar of ashes? 

There’s a million what ifs and they all terrify me. This is why I wish I could just believe there is a god out there and that I knew 100% I was going to heaven or hell. 

But this is my thought process. Every time I get depressed. 

I get upset and depressed, I think that I need to die, I think about how I would do it, and then I think about this. And now I’m depressed and scared shitless and sometimes crying. 

Idk what else to say now so I’ll stop",04Feb2019,1

I can’t tell my parents that I don’t trust them because they will then pry and the whole thing will repeat.

I also imagine myself in love songs with my “ideal guy,” this past year I’ve been hurt several times by several guys. It makes me feel pessimistic about love and the only time I can feel good about it is imagining a made up boy. The thing is I do this a lot. I listen to music for most of the day. Most of the music I listen to is musicals, therefore I’m daydreaming about this a lot.

13,"Before I say anything, I know I have my faults, I will admit some things about myself in this post that nobody knows about.

I’m a 14 year old male, when I was younger (about preschool to 6th grade) my dad would get very angry about small stuff and lash it out on me since I was the only male in the house. He would pick up furniture and threaten to throw it at me and threaten to hurt me. As I grew older I started to become more and more void of emotion. I always have been a “troublemaker” in elementary school I was known as a bully, but I wasn’t aware that I was, I just did things without thinking. In late 7th grade I started to get into juuling, which I’m sure all of you know what it is. I ended up losing my juul and quitting, but then I got my hands on some weed and it became a habit. I want to address that I’m not at all a dumb kid, I have been told by psychologists that I’m intelligent and much more developed for my age. But just because I am intelligent doesn’t mean I make the most intelligent decisions. I fell in love with pot and would smoke it every night. I  got my friends to do it too, and it was something I felt helped me bond with them. But my friendships never felt even, they have always felt like I’m trying to keep the other person on a hook. In early 8th grade I began to use my friend to help me shoplift for a business where I would steal gaming mice and sell them on eBay. I made quite a lot of money from that but since I didn’t have a secure place to store it other than PayPal I ended up spending it all due to my impulsivity. I recently figured out a method of exchanging Amazon cards for Bitcoin in which I would buy weed on the deep web, since I was tired of my dealer being unresponsive and slow. But I had another problem, I noticed my 2 closest friends starting to distance themselves from me, so naturally I tried to keep them close by guilt tripping and other tools that failed. Soon enough I accepted that they are no longer my friends and I gotta move on. Before they distanced themselves I had scammed a guy and found out he was talking shit behind my back and punched him in the jaw in the locker room, I got suspended for 3 days and was recommended to go to a psychiatrist by the school counselor since I didn’t show any signs of remorse. I went to the psychiatrist and the first time I wasn’t very open about anything but the second time I told her about everything and I think it made me feel a little bit better. I’ll be starting therapy soon, which will be an interesting experience for me. But the advice I’m looking for is how should I go about finding new friends because I feel like I have very limited options because of how different I am from everyone else it’s like I have to put up personas for people which can be annoying at times. Incase you’re wondering I have become self aware that there is a chance I’m a narcissist. I’ve been told by my friends, and I have done extensive research on the topic as well. I’m just looking for some advice on how I should find a new group and specific things I should do and not do.",04Feb2019,1
14,"I have a lot of mental disorders. It causes me stress in my life and school. I have ADHD,ASD, Dyscalculia, and NLD. Im also seeing a dr to see if I have Psychotic Depression. I dont think I have that but my parents and teachers do. 

I feel so overwhelmed all the time. I have to take medications for my ADHD. I forget sometimes. My parents trust me to remember because I am 19. When I forget to, people notice. I also get overwhelmed because of school and projects. I have to do more math practice because of my learning disabilities. Im getting so anxious from math. I learn concepts slower than everybody else.  I get sent out of class to work on my math almost everyday because I get frustrated or I talk to the person next to me too much. They dont like that. 

Im having more violent outbursts at home. They cause me to feel broken. It upsets my family. I get angry and swear alot. I also hit myself. Some days I get angry at little things. I have weeks where I just feel irritable and Im hard to talk to. 

I have a hard time communicating my feelings sometimes. Im fully verbal but describing how I feel is hard. I describe it wrong and people get mad. I dont know how to fix this. Its why my parents still go with me in the drs office. I confuse doctors sometimes apparently. 

My mom and dad want me to get a card that says my diagnoses so that certain interactions go better.

16,"I remember the exact date and year  and moment of the first ""outbreak"", it's something that stayed with me and is still happening in some variations tol this day. Over the years I've come to realize, that even though I have a pretty broad and rich vocabulary, and I can usually express myself quite well with words, when trying to explain this specific mental phenomenon, people (even ""professionals"") stare back with a clueless look, sometimes trying to lead me to answer very narrow and specific questions (it's understandable why) like: ""so it makes you feel... sad? depressed?"";  


It's a cognitive thing it happens ""in response"" to certain feelings and emotions -- the feelings that arise from becoming  aware to good qualities of yourself, especially through the eyes of someone else (think, the moment you realize a person has a ""crush"" on you, or ""values"" you somehow, sees some quality of you, which highlights it) -- the feelings that arise when experiencing ""human solidarity"". Basically much later I came across the notion of ""Flow"" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow\_(psychology)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))), and what I am describing has some similarities to  that, in the sense of a ""rewarding"" feeling, and a feeling of ""self worthiness"", of ""becoming aware to your place in the world"".  


Now those scenarios, sometimes trigger an unwanted mechanism, where as when the ""good feeling"" starts to rise, something happens, which I can't fully explain - but it's as if a mental ""opposing force"" acts against the ""good feeling"" -- ""saying"" that ""it shouldn't happen"" -- then there's this ""clash"" between the forces, there is a feeling of severe cognitive dissonance  -- eventually resulting in feelings of stress, anxiety, fogginess.  


Does that make \*any sense\* to anyone? Do any one have some clue of what I'm talking about, and can suggest some clue or suggestions for directions to handle it?  


I've only recently discovered that certain \*Dopamine"" inhibitors pills \*affect\* this situation, makes a change  
(while in the past I've been offers stuff related to Serotonin (SSRIs) which didn't help or change things --  
and I'm still experimenting with that, with help from a psychiatrist.

I spent most of my teen years in and out of psych wards for depression, and my diagnoses have ranged from depression and anxiety, to borderline, to bipolar 2, to psychosis NOS. I read somewhere in my file that I'm very ""diagnostically ambiguous"".

My most recent diagnoses and the ones I agree most with are borderline traits and schizotypal traits, but because neither of these are full-on personality disorders, I still don't feel like I belong in those communities. I don't relate to people with BPD because I don't struggle socially in the same way.

25,"[Throw away for obvious reasons]

During secondary school (I was 15-16 at the time so middle school I think for Americans) and puberty I had lasting spouts of depression. I never did anything about it because I assumed everyone got depressed time to time so I just kept on keeping on.

But occasionally I would transition out of depressive episodes (without realising) to a point where I felt almost on top of the world. I would feel invincible and have grandeur illusions about myself. Thinking that I was the best person, understanding the world and the universe in a way others couldn't, feeling like I was the centre of life and literally couldn't die. 

It wasn't until I started getting depressed again that I realised those thoughts weren't normal, but I've never told anyone this until now. These thoughts started to come back after I broke up with my GF late 2017 but I didn't notice that I was falling into it again. 

This time was different however as I actually started acting on my thoughts of superiority. I felt like a new overly confident person and because of the positive feedback I was receiving from my new personality my ego was hugely inflated. This is when I started abusing drugs, pushing away the people close to me, ruining relationships and generally acting recklessly.

Looking back I definitely have some regrets and currently I'm dealing with depression, mild paranoia and insomnia. 

I need to know if this was just me being stupid or if I possibly have a disorder and if it is disorder related what can I do to prevent myself from transitioning back into reckless behaviour.

I'm not sure if it's like true depression or just some jacked up pubescent chemical imbalance. 
 
 I guess the reason it started was when my brother turned around 10 he's been absolutely awful, he's pretty much the stereotypical mischievous kid but with minor tourettes, ADHD and ADD attached. He really never has seemed to care about anyone other than himself and will throw fits not unlike that of a five year old when he doesn't get his way. Every time I've put my trust in him he's just ended up blackmailing me or straight up betraying me. I've lost all faith in having a brother who I can relate to and in this period of time I have caused myself to want to be as far away from him as possible as a person. Over the years I have become increasingly socially inept, wimpy, and have become an all around antisocial. Because of this, I have developed a feeling of loneliness (even with friends and a girlfriend), self loathing, and uselessness. It kills me to think that the source of my problems seems to stem from my brother (although he may simply be the scapegoat) and I find myself dreading existence because of the fact that I hate myself because of my little brother. He radiates negativity to such an extent that his constant screaming and yelling and arguing and crying has caused my entire family to be in a constant state of stress. Eventually, my mom got leg cramps, my dad got shoulder cramps, both of which related to stress, and I now have stress caused neck and back pain that can be quite awful at times.

 Moving on from the possible source, I had my mom get me checked out by a doctor for anything out of the ordinary about my thought process and personality. The doctor recommended I see a psychiatrist and then handed my mother a list of therapists to choose from. She took a couple looks at the sheet in the car and then decided that ""I'm only sad because I'm not man enough to try to get better."" This is not exactly what she said but it's what I gathered from our conversation. I could have completely misunderstood her for all I know. I've never been to great at understanding people. But tobasically be called a pussy by my own mom for something I've been feeling hurt quite a bit. After that I sort of stopped caring about what I feel and how my family feels. I don't like being around my family at all anymore come to think of it. I would much rather be alone. And that's exactly how I feel, alone even though there's a world of people outside my door. This disconnect from my entire family has made my homelife almost sickening to me as it gives me enough time to overthink a few random things and then proceed to have a freak out. I've never been really good at making sense so this probably feels more like some dude's incoherent ramblings to read so I'll just leave it at this, am I right in assuming that I may be depressed or minorly bipolar, and is there ever a real, lasting light at the end of the tunnel?

My family’s never been supportive of mental issues anyway, my anxiety has reached an all time low. It crippling, I feel like I can barely function. I have voices that tell me to not eat, I usually listen. Stress and anxiety from moving to college  gave me T-E, (telogen effluvium) which makes your hair fall out. In around 3 and a half months I’ve lost about half my hair, which used to be the part about myself I loved the most. I have no one to talk to, the only way I have to cope is to drink it all away.

35,"As a teenager, I just called them phases. But I'm getting too old (30) for this. I sometimes get the urge to completely change who I am. And it's usually an image of myself that I call one of my weird phases. I was gothic, I used to skateboard, then I was preppy, it's constantly changing and it's so upsetting. Because I end up upset with myself and urgently feel the need to change my image and I'll keep this image for awhile, and then I'll change to something else. I go through moments of being sure of myself and then moments of pure confusion and not knowing who I am. It's like my sense of self has completely eroded. I suffer from depersonalization, but I'm not depersonalized right now. Or maybe I am? How do I stop this? ",04Feb2019,1

However, instead of committing to a depressive spiral, or another attempt, I expressed my pain through exercise. I told myself, ""If I'm stronger, then I can help to catch those other that may fall."" So, the burning of my muscles was my pain, with each push-up and sit-up, I continued to listen to the music until my mind exploded into an array of light.

37,"Hey all, I need help. A bit of backstory: throughout my gcse-college I suffered from pretty bad hypochondria, (this small headache IS a tumor and so on) but it disappeared for a while after leaving college. Recently its made a  s t r o n g comeback and its worse than ever. I can be doing anything I would normally do and suddenly I just remember whatever it is I'm worrying about this time and it fills me with such a sickening sense of dread and hopelessness that I just don't know what I can do. Its like a switch in my head that just kills me inside at any given moment. Its gotten to a point where over the last few days I've been losing out on probably 3-4 hours of sleep every night (my sleep schedule was already pretty messy already tho) due to the endless worry that comes with being alone with my thoughts. My all time greatest fear is that one of these times ill be right and I really don't know what I would do if that happens. Its 5:30 in the morning here and I've been in bed for 6 hours with 0 sleep. Pretty sure I have a cold also so its a bit of a vicious loop of: 
I feel bad -&gt; ah yes I'm dying -&gt; (cant sleep) super tired = feeling even worse -&gt; see I told me I was dying (and so on).

43,"I've always wanted to talk about my symptoms that I had since I was a child. I'm a 25 year old adult turning 26 years old in few days. I have problems such as not being able to distinguish where to put an ""s"" after a word, not being able to use correct prepositions in sentences, lacking very basic general knowledge, lacking memory, not being able to understand sentences well when reading out loud, etc.

**Here I will list out few of the example problems that I can think of for now:**

1. Not being able to distinguish where to put an ""S"" after a word

* I would use ""head phone"" or ""head phones"" or ""ear phone"" or ""ear phones"" interchangeably.
* I would say ""fishes"" when there are a lot of fish instead of ""fish""
* I would sometimes say ""feets"" instead of ""feet""
* Any ""question"" or ""questions""?

1. Not being able to use correct prepositions

* I would say ""holes on a tree"" instead of ""holes in a tree""
* Can't distinguish difference between ""turn onto something street"" or ""turn into something street""
* ""Drive on left or right lane"" or ""Drive in left or right lane""
* ""get in the plane"" vs ""get on the plane""

1. Lacking very basic general knowledge

* If I was asked what did George Washington do, I would just be like he did something with the 13 colonies, and I wouldn't be able to elaborate further on it......
* I didn't know tourist attractions like the Grand Canyon or Niagara Falls were owned by the government. I thought they were owned by some rich people.
* I wasn't able to distinguish between the word mammal and animal a few days ago and had to google ""mammal""...
* Right now I can't distinguish difference between ""reptiles"" and ""amphibians"" and I will have to google them to see the differences.

1. Lacking memory or attention

* Even though I played blackjack or Texas Hold 'Em Poker numerous times in the past, if I stop playing those card games for few months, The rules become very blurry in my mind and I will have to google the rules again.
* In middle or high school, I always had to go up to my teacher after he or she had read the instructions for something to assure I have everything right.
* I have hard time understanding some movies or shows without English subtitles.
* If I talk I sometimes get lost in my words and stutter and make up weird words to fit the sentence because I can't think of a word at the moment.

There are soooooo many more problems to list. These are just a very few I can think of as of now. Is this like a mild learning problem? Does anyone else experience these kinds of problems in their daily life? Am I really lacking mentally compared to normal people?",04Feb2019,1

To recap I’ve never truly believed in myself and basically never tried my best at anything and I’ve never really been too passionate about anything. All this came and bit me in the ass real hard, it’s my first year of high school and I missed the info days for my classes because I’m apart of some special program for tech kids. Seeing as I missed the info I didn’t know what was really going on and that made me really stressed, like a level of stress that I’ve apparently never experienced. I only know that because for a solid 4 weeks I would have visual hallucinations at least twice a week. At first they were kind of scary but by the first week I just couldn’t care any more. They were still there but I wasn’t freaked out by them, even if they got arguably scarier, as in shadow people. Anyways they still happen from time to time but since I’ve been on a break for the past while they seem to have slowed down quite a bit. I guess what I’m asking is of what I’m going through in terms of the hallucinations is something that has a name and if I’m taking my hallucinations the right way. Thanks I guess.",04Feb2019,1

Are we even sure about chemical imbalances as I've heard people talk about? Sure, in extreme cases this seems legitimate, but what about things in the middle? Humans have got by without the the idea of psychiatry/psychology/etc for most of our history (I think) and why do I think now, I somehow am entitled to have someone listen to me? I don't want to complain. Materially, I'm fine. Financially I am secure. My life is more than ok. However I feel uneasy, anxious, and like an outsider. Every time I join a group of people I feel like I start to feel a sense of expulsion even when I try hard to be 'normal'. When I'm not trying, and am more myself, I tend to spend a lot of time in my head thinking about tangential ideas so I find it hard to stay focused with people and especially groups. I've always considered this to be me thinking critically, but I find it hard to turn that mode off. If talking about topics I enjoy I am extremely engrossed by them. I try to suppress this when talking to people normally as to not seem strange. I've always been this way though. But maybe that's nothing special. I find it hard to know what's normal and what's not. I feel like I need to find enough people who don't feel my way or do what I do in order to legitimise that I am somehow different. I'm so confused.

65,"[I have already posted this in the bipolar subreddit but the majority of comments have been removed by mods or just disappeared before I could read them (says 25 comments but there is like only 12)]

During secondary school (I was 15-16 at the time so middle school I think for Americans) and puberty I had lasting spouts of depression. I never did anything about it because I assumed everyone got depressed time to time so I just kept on keeping on.

But occasionally I would transition out of depressive episodes (without realising) to a point where I felt almost on top of the world. I would feel invincible and have grandeur illusions about myself. Thinking that I was the best person, understanding the world and the universe in a way others couldn't, feeling like I was the centre of life and literally couldn't die. 

It wasn't until I started getting depressed again that I realised those thoughts weren't normal, but I've never told anyone this until now. These thoughts started to come back after I broke up with my GF late 2017 but I didn't notice that I was falling into it again. 

This time was different however as I actually started acting on my thoughts of superiority. I felt like a new overly confident person and because of the positive feedback I was receiving from my new personality my ego was hugely inflated. This is when I started abusing drugs, pushing away the people close to me, ruining relationships and generally acting recklessly.

Looking back I definitely have some regrets and currently I'm dealing with depression, mild paranoia and insomnia. 

I need to know if this was just me being stupid or if I possibly have a disorder and if it is disorder related what can I do to prevent myself from transitioning back into reckless behaviour.

Should I talk to someone qualified about this or am I just being paranoid again? ",04Feb2019,1
66,"A few years ago, I was sexually assaulted at a party. When it happened, I didnt realize what was happening because I was extremely intoxicated, but once I sobered up, its always felt icky. Fastforward to Friday. Ive been seeing this guy for a bit and we decided it was time for me to meet his friends. He took me to his apartment and his friends were great, but he was very touchy (like hand on my thigh, poking my stomach, playing with my hair, laying on me, at one point, nibbling my arm) and during the entire time he was touching me, I felt totally helpless and kept having flashbacks to my sexual assault. I went home and sat with my friend because all I wanted to do was cry. Ive felt incredibly shitty since this happened and Im trying to find a way to end things with him. 
I guess what Im trying to ask is one, what should I do, and two, has anyone had flashbacks that felt more shitty than the actual thing that happened? ",04Feb2019,1
67,"Hello good people of r/mentalhealth, I'm asking to help my girlfriend overcome her trauma that has been crippling her life.

My girlfriend and I met in highschool and now we are dating in college. For the half year we are together, I began to see a big problem that is worsening my girlfriend's life day by day: dealing with trauma. To elaborate, she has trauma from childhood scholiosis, and she would abuse drugs to ease the emotional pain. She would also react violently when I try to talk to her about the trauma, making me feel helpless.

The trauma comes from a scholiosis that is still lasting. Ever since childhood, she has been suffering from moderate scholiosis. During her childhood years when she was 8-14, she put a pause on school to traveled all over the world for years to find a doctor  who can hopefully cure the illness. As a result, she has underwent numerous painful treatments for years (bracing and exercising that was too painful to let her sleep at night). As those exercise had only successfully stopped the scholiosis from worsening, they did not cure the disease. For years through now, she has dealt with the illness.

The problem began when I see her abusing drugs and harming herself to deal with the trauma. Whenever she feels stressed and anxious because of the trauma, she would do laughing gas to ""ease the pain"". Moreover, she would self-harm to ""distract"". Recently, she had withdrawal symptom from quitting laughing gas, and her painfulness and potential addiction concerned me very much.

She always refused to quit drugs or to talk about the issue. We had some talks and arguments about her drug problem. All the time she would attribute her drug addiction to her experience with scholiosis, which is a subject I dare not talk about: she would cry painfully and make threats to stop me from talking about it.
Moreover, because her trauma comes majorly from seeing doctors to no curing results for her scholiosis, she hates the feeling of going to a psychiatrist or psychologist because that is similar to the very source of her trauma.

I feel helpless and bad. My talks to her had been all bad and unfruitful, so much that they would all end in her crying, and me getting frustrated and feeling helpless. after the third time of that kind of talk, she wouldn't talk to me for two days andI think I really am fucking things up by being unhelpful to her issue and narcissistic to my thinking about her dealing with the issue.

I Really want to help her but I think she needs a professional to help. I really have no idea how I can stop her from going into drug addiction and deeper emotional grief. So, dear friends of r/mentalhealth, what are the things I can do to help her?",04Feb2019,1

71,"Hello folks. I come to you today with a very heavy heart, disturbed and extremely worried. 

I have a friend who I have known for quite some time. They recently went through a breakup and quit taking their medication (an SSRI). Bipolar runs in their family, but they were not diagnosed with it (as far as I’m aware). 

Basically, since I began talking to this person again, they have been exhibiting frightening behaviors. Staying up all night, not eating or sleeping barely at all, sending 40+ videos at a time, uploading long rambling videos to Facebook in which they slip into various different accents, referring to themselves as a warrior and calling me by very, very absurd mythological names.

They have told me everyone around them is saying they are manic, and that they are very angered by this because they are just hurting, not manic. But it’s EXTREMELY clear something deeper is going on. The eyes don’t look right. The speech is disorganized, they are hypersexual, overconfident, and insisting they are in love with me and going to marry me.

This person flips at the drop of a coin if you say the wrong thing to them, and as much as they say they “love me”, has lashed out and said incredibly, deeply wounding things to me within an hour of the previous confession. It makes very little sense.

How can I help this person without sending them off the deep end? I don’t know their parents, but they live with them and have been telling them they need help, but not taking any action. I don’t wish to talk to this person anymore, as they are scaring me a lot, but I’m worried that they have no one else. Is there anything I can do to encourage this person to seek help ASAP and disengage without getting hurt in the process or making things worse?


Thank you ",04Feb2019,1
72,"First off, I want to say that I have not been diagnosed with ADHD or seen a specialist. I am looking for advice to see what my next steps should be or if there should be any at all. Tell me your thoughts. Here are some of my symptoms.

 1. I crave instant gratification more than anything. I spend countless hours watching meme videos and the like on youtube. I know I should be focusing on long term goals but I can rarely motivate myself to sit down and get started on things like homework and projects. When I can get started I'm gittery and distractable. My grades have also slowly been slipping over my last two years at university.

 2. I'm completely lost in group settings. In groups of 4 or less I do perfectly fine because I can get a read on the overall vibe, but any more than that and there is way too much input and I end up shutting down. I then either sit there silently or remove myself from the situation entirely.

 3. I am much better at expressing my complex thoughts clearly when I'm drunk. I know this might sound true for everyone but from what I understand alcohol works as a depressant in the system the same way Adderall works on the system of a person with ADHD. When I'm sober it's like my mind is a fog and most of the time I can only verbally express surface level thoughts and nothing deeper.

 4. I have an incredibly difficult time sleeping and maintaining a decent sleep schedule. I usually play video games at night and a lot of the time I find myself staying up very late. I've tried toning down screen time before bed and reading but when I close my eyes I cant shutdown my brain. Many nights I only get a couple hours of sleep or none at all and end up passing out from exhaustion some time in the middle of the next day.

 5. Routines in general are very hard for me to stick to. I've tried to use planners but I always end up putting them aside and just do whatever I want in the moment.

 6. My family does have a history of ADHD and depression. Multiple members on both sides.",04Feb2019,1

74,"I'm a 17 year old female from the United States just trying to vent or figure out whether what I'm going through mentally might be cause for concern. Sorry for any formatting errors, I'm on mobile!

I have been seeing therapists/ counselors pretty consistently since I was 13. As of right now I have not gone to an appointment in almost 5 months.

I have had terrible social anxiety and self image problems for as long as I can remember. I started to get hormonal and angry in middle school and then when I hit high school (14) it got really fucking bad. Terrible depression, anger, unstable emotionally, started to get manipulative and mean and toxic to those around me. I then got into a lot of trouble at school and home, and attempted suicide which landed me in the hospital. Following that I was diagnosed bipolar (just turned 15) by a psychiatrist who I began seeing every week. We were trying a shit ton of new medicines off and on for two years with no real positive outcome from any. I was on multiple antidepressants, mood stabilizers, Vyanse at one point, stuff like that. I had two other hospitalizations, most recently at 16, which led to another (new?) diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. 

I feel like this might sound far fetched and like I'm throwing terms into the mix to get some weird story but this always was weird to me too. My doctors at the hospital said they couldn't formerly diagnose me til 18 but my psychiatrist said he was very sure about the new diagnosis as well as the previous one of bipolar. I was always uncomfortable with my treatment because I felt like I was becoming really complacent and just trying different medicines and terms with this doctor on the off chance they would work. I also bounced around with therapists a lot. Looking back, I have no idea what was even wrong. I 100% don't see myself as bipolar anymore.

After years of constant medication and no end in sight I was just really numb and felt the worst I have ever felt in my entire life. 

I don't feel like that anymore- I've been off all medication and therapy since October. My issues now are just weird. I don't feel depressed and low the way I used to but the way I'm taking care of myself and my mind the past few months is absolutely terrible. Self care is at an all time low and I still don't feel very interested in anything. I picked back up smoking weed from October to December and smoked every day like high to high, barely ever sober. I drank heavily a couple times too. Eventually I felt the urge to try bigger stuff and knew I could find harder things where I live. it was really frightening so I just quit smoking cold turkey and everything, gave my cigarettes away gradually which I had also taken up, etc.

This brings me to my current situation. Being off all medication, drugs, alcohol, therapy, has made me feel really really clear headed and introspective. Which is a good thing. But also, I think I've just been constantly dissociating 24/7 and I don't know how to deal with that. I've read vaguely on depersonalization and dissociation and stuff and I don't know if that's what's going on. Basically when I do literally anything I feel immediately taken out of the situation and I'm not connected to it. I'm not floating above myself but I feel like I can't ""stay in my head"" or just enjoy a situation for myself. I used to cope with productivity issues when I was younger by pretending I was in a movie or that someone was watching me in order to feel? validated idk? Lmao this all sounds very strange to put into writing. It's come to the point where I can no longer choose to just pretend to be witnessed as happy from afar or just act like I'm in my own show- my brain literally automatically does this to itself and I feel really confused and rushed and awkward when I realize I'm a person, I'm me, but I'm painfully aware of that. I don't like functioning and I don't even know how to function without feeling detached from my person and emotions. I feel like I'm seeing myself from the outside in and the inside out at the same time, it's really fucking weird. Im probably going back to therapy soon haha, but I just want to know if anyone has any thoughts on what could be going on or a good baseline on how to describe better whats happening when I go back to counseling. I literally do not have any connection with myself looking in the mirror and feel like I have no personality traits or anything, and I block out 70% of my life because of insecurity and weird shit that I think about on the daily. So I can't remember if this is even vaguely new for me- its just happening everyday dozens of times. I don't even feel sad- I'm more happy right now in my personal life then I ever have been. I just feel disconnected and really strange.

I'm so sorry, this was a rant. I would really appreciate any insights or support anyone might have. if anyone else is feeling similar stuff I would love to talk about it!!

TL;DR: i don't know what to do, feel invalidated, scared, and lost. 

I'm somewhere on the autism spectrum, (have been told its on the high functioning side, with aspergers syndrome), diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, might have ptsd/c-ptsd, some form of depression, and general anxiety.

I've honestly never had the best mental health, as I was bullied all through my primary school and high school life, never any friends, or close friends, until high school, of which they're the closest friends I've ever had, and a few since finishing, been the ""boy who cried wolf"" to my family, always been told that I'm an idiot, and not the smartest person out there, family have said it as well, parents almost always chose my friends, and said friends always hurt me in some way, been a little emotionally disconnected from people because of that, family, and having no friends.

It doesn't help that my family are a bunch of narcissists (I don't think I am, but am going to undergo test to put mind at ease, and have proof I'm not one), all have a quitters attitude (I don't as I never learnt to quit or give up), all are prideful, to the point of never asking for help (I'm guilty of not asking for help, but mines more towards being a fear, than pride. And if I need help, will ask), feeling like a slave and scapegoat, and always being invalidated by how I feel. All of my suicidal thoughts and ideation, to my family, are ""childish, and stupid"", and that I should ""grow up, and get over them"", as apparently I'm too old to be having them...

I'm living at my sisters, but have 2 weeks to find somewhere else, or do all the house work + the outside. The annoying thing is, is that she's never home, yet expects the house and the backyards to be immaculate...

I was at the hospital last year, in November, because I felt I was going to kill myself (the thoughts, ideation, and some sharp stabbing sensations kept happening), and today she said that she won't ""fall for it"" again, if I admit myself to hospital...

Funny thing is, is I feel safer around my friends, and away from my family...

I have proved to myself in the past that if I even half apply myself that I can easily make it to the top of my classes, but that status only is mine for  a week or a week and a half before I deflate my effort and stop trying all together while boasting of a high GPA. 

	

	I boast about a lot of things, and to be fair, there has not been something that I have picked up and not come to an early understanding about. but I boast and the feeling a weird pressure to just stop trying and  never continue to try gain a deeper understanding of something washes over me.- I show shear complacency with long term failure but short term enjoyment. This weird pressure I feel is always accompanied with the ideas of severe stress, sometimes I can not force myself out of bed, and then by a physical feeling of my brain just being squashed from the top down.  I get the pressure when I feel stressed about something or depressed. 

The funny thing is that I love momentary stress the bigger the better. I can handle doing a lot very fast at once, and actually love being overwhelmed- I feel like I am thriving and can breath deeply; Yet I will always eventually shut myself down after prolonged exposure to a long term stress-ant.

	Somehow, I want to string this response to, child hood issues that still persist. My mother and Father always fought and so divorced when I was young; However, their fighting continues and the some of the first things I remember was having to try and mediate between the two- I do not know how I could ever do that being so young as to just have formed lasting memories. They fought and fought and still do fight to this day. And to this day I still have to try and mediate this fighting, and my involvement has increased with my age. This fighting has also spilled over on to just me as well. I remember having to call the police once because I was so scared of my father. I remember his grabbing my hands telling me he was going to break them, I pushed him down and ran to my room, I was in middle or high-school- all of these memories flow together and yet still have gaps. 

	So who knows, maybe there is a connection of feeling stress at school that reminds me of stress at home, or maybe I am using that as a crutch of some sort for not wanting to do my work.

It may sound strange but I don't feel sadness or regret. I've endured many sad occasions in the last few years and caught myself being hurt once and it was when I was very very drunk. I've lost close friends and family and I feel so bad saying I haven't found it hard to move on. I find myself doing acts of charity just to preserve the feelings of others or just not make them mad , when these actions and their results don't bother me at all. 
The other day a dear friend accused me of something (later proven to be not true) and after the accusation threatened to never talk to me again and in all honesty it didn't really bother me. I still went on about work, study and life as usual. He later apologised and I felt no satisfaction or relief.
I've found myself to be more reclusive (in my room reading , listening to music , ps4) since leaving high school but nevertheless meeting my friends frequently.

83,"Hello,

A few years ago I attended therapy after realizing that I was being a huge piece of shit to my ex and my now current girlfriend. I was abusive (emotionally) and just a fucking psychotic cunt. I believed that they were the problem and not me. Long story short, I started going to therapy to stop treating my girlfriend like trash.



And it did help! I'm a much better person now and still with my girlfriend. 



I had a childhood full of abuse and all that good stuff, left me pretty messed up as I've recently discovered. Much more than I thought I knew. In 2017 I dropped out of college due to mental health. I spent 2017-18 mostly working OK jobs and just thinking about what I wanted to do with life. I couldn't think of anything, I'm not passionate about any career path, so I decided I just wanted to make money and applied to be a pipefitting apprentice. 


Last October, I got the letter that I passed the exam and interview! But I didn't feel happy. I got such a bitching letter of acceptance, I was going to get paid 22.60 starting, incredible for a someone who just turned 20 with no higher education! But I felt numb. 



A month later, in December. I got sent out to my first job. Good foreman, good people, good pay and good hours. I was on the path to be able to support myself and my girlfriend by myself. My situation was looking bright as fuck. But I still don't feel anything. I still feel numb, I still feel irritated and nothing really entertains me like it used to. I just feel like I'm going through the motions. I want to just die, but I couldn't bring myself to do that to my girlfriend and cunt parents. 



I want to get therapy. I want to ask for a layoff from my current job and FOCUS completely on mental help because I feel like I'm just at a block. But I feel like it's too late. I don't have insurance and therapy is expensive. I feel if I apply for medi-cal or something once I leave this job that I wouldn't qualify due to how much I ""used"" to make. I don't know what to do. Please help me. I'm sorry if this info is convoluted or all over the place, I can provide more information if needed, tried to keep it brief.

She's helped me from the depths of self-hatred, frustration with who I am in a world that seemed to fit anyone but me. However, by no means, is therapy a cure-all. On the contrary, many individuals point to it being a waste of time or at worst, counterproductive to their needs. (And needless to say, even in the time of writing this I've been struggling with low mood likely as a result of the expectation of graduating in course that I no longer am interested in. That's another story though.)

Perhaps at my worst last year all I needed was someone to talk to about my thoughts who would respond non-judgementally and accept my flaws for what they were and nothing more.

That said, she has broached a subject that I wonder whether more attention needs to be given to. Being ""perfect"" is, after all, more a myth and less of a truth than most will admit even as we admire those around or afar from us in being ""better"" at certain skills or traits.

86,So I have this friend that suffers with depression and I seriously want to help her but I don't know how.

87,"I don’t know where exactly to post this, but I figured in this community hopefully someone else can relate and has a few tricks:
Firstly, I live in Canada, and the cold part too. 
It’s been snowing, grey, and cold since November at least. I can really feel depression setting in now. It’s been probably two weeks since I last saw the sun, not even exaggerating. It’s horrendous. I am so lethargic that once I’m done work I’m basically done for the day. I try to keep up my regular workout schedule, and I take vitamin D daily. My anxiety has spiked too, and everything just feels unending. 
Does anyone has any tips for feeling better? I can’t move or travel right now, as it’s crunch time at my work and I really can’t leave. I already exercise and try to live a healthy lifestyle, but I really miss the sun and being warm. I actually wake up and just wanna cry because I can’t continue to feel like this until winter is over in April or May (yes it sometimes snows in May here). ",04Feb2019,1

Fellowship Health Resources (FHR) is a non profit organization which had a team named Assertive Community Treatment Team (ACTT) which specialized in assisting any of us with mental illness.

This team has been by my side for two years now fighting with me in my struggle for a healthier mind and for the tools I need to be independent in maintaining such.

It’s my experience that ACTT is always in your corner for the pursuit of happiness and a better life. The team offers its patients a psychiatrist, therapist, vocational specialist, forensics specialist, nurse, substance abuse specialist, and peer support.

Any of you with ACTT should be in very good hands and receive excellent information on how to manage your disorder symptoms and grow to become more independent in the process.

If any of you have any questions about this health provider or program, please let me know and I’ll do my best to answer.

Again, this health provider is FHR and the team is named ACTT. 

Again the program is for those with mental illness and psychotic symptoms. 

I know many with Bipolar, Schizoaffective, and Schizophrenia qualify for its services.

I'm in a very stressfull part of my life right now, and could really use some help in surviving this.

I'm 21, working while looking for a new job due to distance, applying to universities, finishing my language education (I'm an immigrant), coaching gymnastics and working at a red cross shop as a volunteer. 

All of these things are necessary right now, as I need coaching to help get into uni, and volunteering to get experience in working in a store to get a job, a new job to be able to work and study, and finish the language school to get into uni. 

All I have to do is survive until next fall when school will (hopefully) start, and when I will have found a new job (again, hopefully), but I feel the stress eating away my mental well-being. On top of this, my boyfriend is depressed and we are focusing on getting him back on his feet, so if anyone has any info on how not to burn out, I could really use it.

TL;DR I'm stressed due to a huge amount of things that need to be done, and I need advice on how to manage my stress.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend Angy is 20 and has had mental health issues for years now; anxiety, depression, low self esteem, etc. I've recommended her to seek help and go to therapy multiple times but economically she depends solely on her parents, and as the title suggest they aren't helpfull.

Her brother Rob, 15, was found crying at the high school's bathroom. The principal, who seems really caring, called the parents to inform them. Instead having an understanding approach, they said things like ""If you don't get good we'll have to take you to therapy and spend the money"". Now, as Angy explained to me, Rob hates their parents wasting money because their struggle with it, and even though he is young understand clearly the effort that takes earning it. Taking all this in account the things their are telling him come across as manipulative, and it honestly makes me really sad.

Their aren't  any better with Angy, with her they didn't even consider therapy, even though they acknowledge she has problems. Everytime she tries to talk to them about it they just get angry and shut her down.

Talking with her we reach the conclusion that 1) Her mother has or had her own issues, but her family just teached her to keep it all for herself, and thats exactly what she is doing to Angy and Rob; and 2) Her father doesn't understand what mental healt really is so just ignores it.

I tried to help Angy and advise her on what to do next, since I had issues too but thanks to therapy now I'm doing great. I told her to talk to the high school principal, he helped her before, about whats going on with the parents. Also, even though she can't pay for therapy, thanks to the National Health System that is implemented in Spain everyone can have access to free health care, which includes mental health. 

She will change doctors, being that the one she has assigned now is shared with her parents. Once that is done, she will asked to be referred to a psychologist. Angy is afraid of hospitals and thinking of all the things she as to do makes her panic, so I recommended her to make it step by step.

&amp;#x200B;

All this situation makes me sad. Parents should be more understanding of their kids struggles and keep their mind open. Their attitude makes me think this will end in either Angy or Rob exploding, or them draffting away from the parents.

It escalated to the point of us sitting in our bedroom on the floor both of us crying. When i mention abuse I do not mean physically. That is important to note however I can't help but wonder if I emotionally degrade him. We went to a super bowl party which has never been my thing and I should have stayed home because this has been the cause of arguments in the past. I'm an introvert as well as bipolar depression, anxiety, and OCD. I have a tendency of getting very riled up and yesterday I went too far. I admit to being very belittling to him every time I asked a question and he gave a response, I was upset we stayed at a friends house later than I felt was necessary and therefore lost control of my temper and yelled at him for making us stay late. I realize now how inappropriate that is and how the situation should have been handled better.  He mentioned if we weren't married he doesn't think we would be together and sometimes he would rather kill himself as opposed to staying in this relationship. He has been so amazing and supportive through every aspect if our life together but now I think he's got a breaking point.

122,"Right, I have a bit of unpacking to do, please bear with me. A few months back I posted here in a desperate attempt at gaining advice. My fiancee at the time was going through a very difficult period because she had been diagnosed with BPD and was immediately put on an inappropriate medication. We did what we could on dealing with the fuckery that is NHS mental health. All while this is happening I'm living in the US while she is in the UK. It took them 3 months for them to finally listen, 2 of those were spent in the hospital for her.

&amp;#x200B;

We spent 2 years together; lots of traveling between us, time spent on the phone, and incredible moments together. Not without our hardships either. Drug addiction, self-harm, loss in the family, insecurities, and issues that seemed insurmountable. We made it through. Being with her made me whole, it gave me hope and it showed me that I can do things without fear. I proposed to her in what couldn't have been a more perfect setting. But again, it wasn't without its rows and difficulties. We made it through.

&amp;#x200B;

The day after my birthday she was admitted into a psych ward. We still spoke on the phone every day but I can see the changes being made in her. Her grandmother passed away during that time, who she was incredibly close to. Things started pilling on, and in hindsight, I see that I might have been a little too rough with how I spoke to her... too often. We argued every day, about meaningless things. But that never scared me, it never made me waver in my dedication towards her. She had an episode where she got sectioned.

&amp;#x200B;

I was able to scrounge up some money to buy a flight to England to see her for the holidays. From the get-go, things felt different. This sweet amazing girl was jaded and cynical. On edge literally all the time. Admittedly, I might not have been in the best of mental states. I had/have a vast amount of insecurities and uncertainties, and I'm still slowly working through it. So it wasn't an amazing time for either one of us. The entirety of that trip is a blur now. Her actions raised a lot of questions, she was dodging questions, keeping secrets, started smoking and was starting to rely on a lot of unhealthy coping mechanisms. I flat out asked her if there was some sort of unfaithfulness going on because those were the red flags that were going off for me. And from there, it was a ticking clock to the end. I believe her when she said she didn't but something was off. From there she was becoming more detached from me. Answers got shorter, the affection was all but gone, and I was starting to feel alone in a different country and in someone else's home. She ended our relationship outside of the psych ward. Every single one of the reasons given for ending it was something that could be talked about and figured out. The last time I saw her she took off on a sprint heading toward the street. I chased after her. Her last words to me were ""get your fucking hands off of me.""

&amp;#x200B;

There were a lot of points that were made on her part that I could understand as something that would cause attrition in a relationship, but none of it was justifiable (in my head) to end an engagement. Apparently, the nurses and other patients were giving her advice and telling her to ""rethink her choices"" when it came to me... which seems unethical to me. A month has passed since then. She was taken off the medication (3 months after asking for it the first time), she's been discharged, and back at her parent's house. I sent her flowers for her birthday, and spoke to her briefly over the phone. She was very cold with me, and when we spoke of what she was up to she informed me that she wasn't going to be traveling to the US for her job this year. Instead, she had applied at her local Lidl. I am not putting down the job or the people that work in something similar, but it shocks me to see that she has decided to possibly give up on a career that she fought tooth and fucking nail for. Knowing her, and who she is/was, I see that she possibly has given up on herself. I can't imagine what drugs they're funneling her now, and I put money down on the fact that she might not be getting the treatment she needs. As much as I love her parents, I know they aren't going to speak about this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I fear for her. I still love her immensely, but I fear she is teetering on becoming part of the cycle of being perpetually in and out of the hospital. I want to do something for her but I don't know what. I want to move on but I feel an empty hole in my chest every day because I might have lost her. I can admit my mistakes, and I can see where I might have approached something wrong but I'm only human. I only did it because I wanted to help. I want her to see that she isn't alone, she doesn't need to give up. I promised her I would never give up on her, or us, and I don't want to give up. I still see myself with her, and our lives together. Part of me still holds on to that very small slither of hope. I'd like t think I am a stable and logical person, but I'm not. I was only trying to be that way for her. I still don't understand what happened because in the context of our time together, this seems like just a speed bump.

I'm not trying to have a pity party. I'm not trying to justify my actions. The only goal I have for writing this is my own catharsis, and to tell each and every one of you... please don't give up. Don't give up on yourself. Don't give up on your loved ones. Don't give up on each other. Love each other unconditionally. Don't be afraid to speak up. I took for granted what I had and now there's a possibility that it's gone. I still thank NHS mental health for trying even if it might've been misguided at times.

124,"^This.

I've been in agonizing emotional pain for more than five years but I never got the help that I needed. This is mainly due to the fact that my country's mental health services are really superficial and professionals don't really pay attention to anything besides depression and anxiety. Here, if you go to a psychiatrist, no matter what symptoms you're describing, they're going to diagnose you with anxiety or depression because they don't really distinguish between the various and multiple mental disorders and personality disorders as long as you didn't try to kill yourself or kill someone else (if you haven't done desperate things, they think it's nothing serious, so they don't care about a diagnosis unless you really try taking your own life). I've been going to different psychiatrists for years now and everyone tells me ""I just need some kind of change in my life"" which is a stupid thing to say as a mental health professional. To put it simple, they don't care. Now I'm not going to complain about it anymore, but I feel like I am severely sick. I can barely function on a daily basis and getting out of bed feels almost impossible. I suffer from really bad derealization and depersonalization and I feel like I have huge gaps in my memory, to the point where I don't remember 50% of my past. I don't really have an ego or an identity and everything seems strange and foreign to me, even friends, family and things that I used to love. My symptoms have been shifting during the past few months and now I feel like I've become rather numb instead of dissociated. I can't summon any feelings for anything and I can't feel any kind of love for my family or anyone else. I lost interest in literally anything and nothing makes me feel good or happy anymore. Moreover than that, I feel like something might be wrong with my brain chemistry, since I can't get drunk or high anymore (the most recent example is about two weeks ago when I tried to trip on DXM but instead felt NOTHING after a relatively strong dose...two days ago I drank huge amounts of alcohol and I didn't get drunk at all). I feel like there's nothing that can actually improve my state of mind and my perception on everything is absolutely fucked. I just feel like giving up because, no matter how much I tried to open up to family and mental health professionals, all they did was ignore me and say that i'm ""exaggerating my symptoms"" (I tried telling mom that I felt ""out of my body"" and just couldn't recognize her face anymore when I was looking at her and she laughed it off, saying that ""such things don't exist"").

128,"I am a 36/m married new dad in Tucson Arizona. In the past, I have had some issues with anxiety and depression. That was about 18 years ago.  Job stress, being a new dad, and regular adult stuff has caused me to slide back into depression.

I would like to talk to a therapist to make sure that I am my best self for my wife and son. Here’s where I have run into a problem. I can’t seem to find a therapist.

Over the last several months, I have called 10 different therapists. Only one has called back, and they only met people during the workday and did not take insurance. The rest either didn’t call back at all, or had phone numbers that just went to a full mailbox.  Almost all of the people who had voicemail messages said that they do not take insurance in their messages.  To be clear, I am leaving a very professional message(“hello my name is x, I am looking to set an appointment, please give me a call back at your convenience.”).

I found these therapists on psychologytoday, and through my health insurance provider(united healthcare). Looking through their list of therapists, I already had a hard time finding someone that was in affiliated with a religious organization, drug rehab, or over 75 years old.  Because of that, it was especially troubling that almost to no one called me back.

After reaching the end of my rope, I talked to a few close friends to find out if anyone had a therapist they liked. Obviously that was very uncomfortable. I got three different names from them. Two of them called me back, and one did not. Both of the two who called me back did not take insurance and we’re not taking on additional patients.

This whole experience has left me very downtrodden about the prospect of finding a therapist. I’m not sure where I should go from here. It seems crazy that no one takes insurance or will call me back. Does anyone have any advice?

When I do simple tasks like homework or watching tv I think, ""wow, one day I won't be doing this because I'll be dead.""

Usually the thought escapes my mind after a day or 2 and I won't think about it again for a while. This time, though, it's been at least a week and I'm still thinking about it. It clouds my thoughts and makes everything I do feel sad and a little meaningless. I know I probably have decades of life left, but even that doesn't reassure me because that sounds like decades of anxiety. Does anyone have any tips on how to overcome this? Therapy isn't an option.

130,"Hi all. For intro, I'm an 18yo male. Still in high school.

So, I'm not in a happy place right now, and my mind seems dead a lot of the time, as if someone turned down how much power is running through my brain so now it's just... there.

I dont know what I'm feeling but it certainly isn't happy or sad. It's more like a blank feeling, and I cant really feel anything emotionally. I've ended up cutting my forearm a bunch of times to feel that relieving sensation after a cut, if you know what I mean. My first day cutting was Thursday, but already my forearm looks like it's been dragged through the streets. It's just, it has red marks all over it.

I want an escape. I want someone to not just tell me everything's going to be okay, but also to comfort me and hug me. I know this sounds stupid and it just makes me sound like a horny piece of pathetic shit, but I just need to get this out somewhere.

My only form of genuine, meaningful contact besdies my parents is my English teacher who I've emailed several times to ask for extensions on homework assignments, and she knows what I'm feeling. My other contact is my cousin, but she works and she cant talk often. I know it's because shes just busy, but it feels like I dont matter to anyone except my English teacher and my parents.

I posted earlier on another account, and someone commented that I may be depressed, but I dont feel like I deserve to be depressed. My life in terms of tangible things is pretty great, except for my social circle, but my parents are incredible and I have no fucking reason to feel depressed except that I feel left out, but even that is something that everyone endures, so it feels like I should just deal with it and suck it up.

Every time I cut myself, I feel like an idiot, but it just feels so relieving. What is wrong with me?

I've stopped planning ahead. In many ways, I've stopped caring. I haven't applied for any internships or any jobs. I haven't fixed up my resume. I don't care about spending money on pizza or fast food or whatever. It just doesn't matter anymore. I don't matter anymore. 

In these moments, I almost wish that I had the balls to do it. I think I accepted long ago, probably when I was a child or in my early teens, that my life will most definitely end on my own. I just wish it could happen before things get to bad.

I wanted to host a discussion regarding the upcoming genetic technology known as CRISPR. 

If you do not know what CRISPR is, this [link](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/genomeediting) will explain it quite thoroughly, but I will give a brief description here. CRISPR is a group of genetic technologies that allow geneticists to alter, add, omit, or switch genetic material in an organism. A sort of biological ""copy-paste"" if you will. It has been hypothesized that CRISPR may be able to alter genetic material for an organism in gestation, giving way to a possible trend of ""designer babies"". 

Aside from cosmetics it has been hypothesized that CRISPR could be used to prevent or curtail physical and mental ailments. Around a year ago, I found myself in a conversation with a woman speaking in a class of mine regarding the struggles and virtues of individuals afflicted with autism and down syndrome. I had asked her: ""If technologies such as CRISPR were refined and put into common use, would it not be ethical to prevent mental afflictions, including autism and down syndrome"". I was and continue to be in favor of preventing such diseases, she was not. She claimed that the practice was ""playing god"", and offered several more arguments she believed to be valid against my contention. 

So, after being reminded of the issue recently, I decided I would see how an impartial demographic feels about this issue. I am an agnostic when it comes to any claim, so I ask this subreddit: what are your thoughts on this? 

&amp;#x200B;

I look forward to your responses! Don't feel like you have to agree with me, be honest. Thank you for your time, and your participation. :)

My bosses and I are all confused. As a worker I am an employers dream. I work hard, Triple rate, and get along with everyone. But I'm tardy. Nothing crazy just 3 or 5 days a month I'll be between 5 and 15 mins late. It has cost me every job I've ever had. Now if I had a solution to this I wouldn't have an issue. I've tried everything in the book. I'm at the point where I'm trying to find the core reason. Maybe I need my meds adjusted. Maybe they have the wrong diagnosis. It's not that i dont want to go to work i just either lose track of time or accidentally sleep in. I dont think it's a huge deal because I used to be so much worse but me getting better about it has come to a stand still. So has my diagnosis. At one point I was thought to be schizoeffective. Right now I'm under the category of having stressed induced psychosis, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and hints of borderline personality disorder ( my psych thinks I have it, my therapist is adamant that I dont, I think I show mild traits of it) also were now thinking ADHD is somewhere in this mix. 

What are your thoughts?
Do any of you guys have issues with timeliness and work?
What other mental things might factor into this issue?
And other than things habbit wise, what are things I can do to try an improve?

Losing jobs sets me back and can be really discouraging. Being able to work, have a good outlook on life, and doing extremely well considering my diagnosis has made it basically impossible for me to get help with things like SSI or disability.

139,"**TRIGGER WARNING** 

Today, I saw shadows walking in my kitchen. I was so scared I grabbed a knife and walked into the room. No one was there. I was home alone. All doors and windows were locked. It was a hallucination. I paced the house for an hour with my knife before I calmed down and finally put it away. I told no one.

Today, I saw worms crawling on my ceiling again. Like most days now, I know they’re not real. I stare, trying to make my broken mind see through it. I could not. I’ve told no one.

Last night, I heard someone breaking into my house. I grabbed my gun and stood at the top of the stairs. I heard nothing, saw nothing. It took a minute or two to calm down enough to get back into bed. 10 minutes passes, I hear it again, grab my gun, run down stairs. Everything is locked. No one is there. This happens 3 more times over the course of one hour. I finally am able to fall asleep. But wait, Seconds before falling asleep, someone is standing right next to the bed. I yelp and punch. When the sleep fog clears no one is there. It was a hallucination. I told no one.

Today, my house was on fire. I could see the smoke, I could smell it. I ran around trying to find it. My boyfriend walked in. He asked what was wrong. I asked if he could smell a fire. He said no. I pretended to laugh it off, while starring at the smoke behind him. I barely got away with telling no one.

Today, I broke. I did drugs I didn’t recognize last night, in a manic impulsive fit. Coming down I hallucinated so intensely I started screaming. my significant other held me until it was over. He chalked it up to the drugs. “Don’t ever take a drug unless you know what it is.” He told me. I told my sister. I felt she didn’t believe me, she laughed it off and also chalked it up to drugs. I knew it wasn’t just the drugs, But exacerbation of a illness I’ve always had. But I told no one the truth.

Today, I scrubbed my bathroom wall for 30 minutes straight, because I couldn’t tell weather or not the yellow spots I was seeing were smoke stains, water damage stains or a hallucination. It was a hallucination. When I realized, I cried, while continuing to scrub, because I couldn’t stop. although I knew somewhere in my mind that they were not there, I didn’t at the same time. my OCD had taken over and they were real stains. I HAD to clean the them. My anxiety took over, it might be a leak, what if the house collapsed because we didn’t know there was water damage. After I got the willpower to force myself to stop, I cleaned myself up, went into the living room, and pretended I didn’t have a psychotic break, and an anxiety attack in the bathroom for 45+ minutes. I told no one. 

Today I believed that the government was watching me. I have a scar on the back of my neck(real). Aliens abducted me as a child, to implant a chip. Now the government can watch me through my own eyes. This has been a reoccurring belief since I was 9. Someone had told me god saw everything I did. So I pretended he could see through my eyes. The fantasy got more elaborate. Pretended turned into belief. The belief in god waned, the belief in government corruption grew. It over took me. And now I’m plagued. I vaguely told a therapist about it once. She told me I’m bipolar with psychotic tendencies. I’ve told no one how frequently it happens.

I had a breakdown today. I’m exhausted. I’m so tired of battling my own mind on a daily basis. Trying to pick out what is reality and what isn’t. Trying to control my mood swings. Trying to beat my insomnia. Keeping secrets...I cried, and sobbed. I considered self harm today. For the first time since my mom died. I’m not safe. I’m not ok. I can’t go on like this anymore.

When i visited first I had some ""Material"" e.g extreme overreacting, trouble sleeping, trouble eating etc.

But now I am feeling ""better"" - i dont have trouble sleeping anymore, eating is still a problem  (NOT! ED related - im having this trouble for several years now and I learned to live with it. My health is also pretty good - not malnourished or anything else)  and I am feeling pretty neutral maybe even a bit empty? Which is kind of cool for me because i resigned a long time ago but i acknowledge that that is neither good nor healthy.

Since I am having problems with taking me and my depression serious the lack of ""material"" makes me really afraid to go there again. I know i have some serious problematic views, behavioral patterns etc. which I am fully aware of but would rather be treated by Talk Therapy instead of medications.

Has anyone an Idea what I can (or should) say to the doctor? Not getting medication would confirm my views that I am being overdramatic and I would cancel these appointments before I am starting to invent problems.

I reconnected with her and it went great; she didn't blame me for the breakup or anything and we both came to terms that it was just a terrible time for a good relationship in both our lives. The difference between how we handled it is that she had friends to go to, and eventually formed a relationship out of one them. I don't resent her in any way for that, and I'm actually really proud that's she's been able to put away the past and be mature enough to talk to me as a friend.

148,"I started seeing this girl a little over a month ago. Things have been sublime. Truly. Early indications are really good. 

She deals with some anxiety issues that I am unfamiliar with at best. Yesterday she had a bit of a moment that I wanted to help with, but I couldn’t. Whether it was because I didn’t know how or maybe she didn’t want to open up? 

She told me to just let her work it out in her head and seemed otherwise fine today. 

I just feel helpless. Coupled with the fact I am a giver at heart, I wanted to do something. 

Is this something that I need to just step back and let happen? Or is there a way I can support and help without being intrusive? ",04Feb2019,1
149,"So I’m at a point in my life where I feel lost. My existence feels aimless, and I have no idea what direction to go in to find meaning and happiness. 

The way I was raised. My school work was everything. It was all I was ever praised for, all I did, all I really knew. 

My social skills, physical health, and other hobbies were never allowed to develop. My parents have a lot of issues, and mid junior year, my mom basically had a breakdown and decided that I wasn’t allowed to take the sat or apply for colleges.
My whole world felt like it had collapsed. Everyone I knew was going forward with their lives to a college they loved, and I got left behind. 
I ended up moving in with my friends family because things got so bad at my house, and since then I’ve worked lots of minimum wage jobs. I tried to be optimistic that things would be so much better after I left my toxic house, but the lack of intellectual stimulation at my jobs and even the people I met made me feel empty. 
For whatever reason, I haven’t been able to connect or make friends anywhere I’ve worked. I really tried, but it didn’t happen. 

I’ve spent close to 2 years now working shitty jobs, feeling aimless, worthless, bored and unhappy. I’ve been putting off going to jr college because I have this overwhelming fear that most of the people there are going to be like all the people I’ve worked with, and I won’t be able to connect with them. Then I’ll be paying money, and giving myself more work to do while not having any of the enjoyment of a social life or good intellectual stimulation. 
And for some reason, I feel like if that happens. It will break me. 
(P.s) Also, my parents don’t help me at all financially. But they make too much for me to qualify for any fafsa need based aid until I’m 24. I’m 20 now. So what we schooling I do I’ll have to pay for myself.
I know this may seem like a silly problem. But I can’t seem to find any meaning or direction, or feelings of social acceptance on my own, but when I was in school I had that. I just don’t know what to do, or how to do it. Thoughts?",04Feb2019,1
150,"It's been three nights in a row when I would fall asleep, and start having weird ""dreams"" that leave me in a sleeping-awake state. They are like commands of my mind, such as go outside for a run, eat this, talk to this person, and I would have super vivid dreams about daily things I do. But then I wake up in the middle of the night crying and confused, feeling needy and kinda scared of falling asleep again. I wanna know what are those dreams-commands, they repeat themselves after they end. ",04Feb2019,1
151,"After a rough appointment with my dr. to discuss my medications...I stopped taking all of them. They changed my dose and style of a medication from an extended release to a twice a day higher dose...I felt like they weren’t really interested in helping me and I was frustrated.
I don’t see how that change is going to help the side effects I was complaining about. I think I got blown off because I was stupid and admitted I had taken something I wasn’t prescribed a few times to counter the side effect.

So I didn’t pick up the new pills. And I missed my next dose...and the next. And 2 weeks of doses. For the first 4 days I felt phenomenal...then i started remembering why I’m on medication. By the end of the second week I was on the floor in a ball crying over nothing, shaking and gasping against my racing heart. I took my pills the next day, one of them anyways not the other that I suspected made the side effects worse. I’ve been taking my old medication for the last 6 days, im...ok. Definitely better than crying on the floor. Definitely not as good as I felt coming off the medications.

I think I’m tired of paying people to pretend to care about me for 20 minutes at a time. I’m tired of seeing a stranger over and over. I’m just another patient to them, same shit as the next and last person, another brick in the wall. I feel like they can’t even remember me when I come in, they have a million other patients and it’s a factory line of pills and pats on the back. I don’t want to do any of it anymore. And the idea of more sit down therapy is even worse to me. I already biffed that up by withholding a ton of symptoms and issues. Don’t want to keep beating that dead horse. It’s been agreed by every specialist and dr I’ve ever seen that it’s more than can be tackled with therapy alone. I’m just imbalanced. I want to quit going to anyone at all, But I know I haven’t found the right medications...

I feel like I’m looking down the barrel on this. On this medication I feel good enough that I at least know I want off the pills so I can focus and finish a damn sentence (that’s the side effect I’m struggling with) but off the meds I’m...I’d say a suicide risk but it’s more a suicide guarantee.

Sorry...I guess I just wanted to vent my frustration with the entire system of mental health and how exhausting it is. ",04Feb2019,1
152,"A little background on my brother:

Has a long criminal record, he has alienated himself from most of my family. and has a long drug history including but not limited to: Marijuana, Mushrooms, Meth, and likely others.

He contacted me in 2017 saying he was involved in some FBI case as his girlfriend was a potential witness. In the end the case apparently went no where.

In the past few months he has started messaging me that he and his girlfriend continued the investigation on their own and are now worried people are trying to kill them. I couldn't get them to contact the police. 

I found out my city had an FBI branch so I reached out to them with the info my brother sent me, and I also contacted the local police to check in on him (we live over 1,000 miles away from each other)

The local police stated that he sounded like he had some mental issues going on but he was not a danger to him self or others at the time.

Since then, he has sent me tons of photos of various mug shots 
claiming there to be some criminals comprise involving cross-dressing pedophiles that are wears masks of other people to disguise themselves, he's mentioned the FBI, CIA, and DHS are all involved and has mentioned the group was in charge of the OKC bombing as well as other horrific acts over the years and now they are after him.

He won't listen to me, and thinks that I am crazy for not believing him.

I am the only member of the family he has reached out to about all of this as he is not on speaking terms with most of the family.",04Feb2019,1

155,"I don't know where else to put this, so here goes.  My 12 year old daughter has suffered from depression and has cut herself a few times over the last year. We're in one of the worst places for mental health care (Northern Nevada), and have struggled greatly to get her the care she needs. Super frustrating and long story a little shorter....she finally got started on an antidepressant. Two days later she started having a terrifying visual hallucination. At first I took her off the antidepressant praying that was the cause, as it can be a rare side effect. But then we found out she'd been having auditory hallucinations for about two weeks, but since they were only noises like pounding and footsteps, she didn't realize (or want to realize) what was going on. So unfortunately, not caused by antidepressant. 

The only way we could get her in front of a psychiatrist before April (countless hours spent on the phone begging anyone to see her and this is the earliest...April and on a cancellation list) was if she did a partial hospitalization program (PHP). We agreed to the 9am to 3pm, Monday thru Friday program. We drive 45 minutes one way, but if it'll help her, I will drive as far as it takes!! The psychiatrist saw her the very first day and started her on Risperdal. Doc stated that she doesn't believe it's schizophrenia, but rather hallucinations caused by depression. (I've also had her regular doctor check her out to make sure no physical cause.) We're now on day 12 of the medication. I know it can take weeks to work, with full effects in 2 to 3 months, but now her hallucinations are even worse! The auditory has changed from just noises to both noises and voices. The already terrifying visual hallucination now talks to her. She sees a misty, dark monster/man with glowing red eyes and a Cheshire cat smile that never leaves. How absolutely terrifying for anyone, especially a 12 year old girl!! She knows the difference between reality and the hallucinations thank goodness. Last night she kept asking and making sure there was nothing on her face, because in the mirror she saw a large scar on her forehead that doesn't exist. Then she saw her dad decapitated! She's absolutely terrified, doesn't understand why this is happening and feels like she's crazy! Basically, things are progressing rapidly in my opinion. The PHP is a complete and absolute joke. It's basically super expensive day care for 12 to 17 year olds. But it's the only way she can continue to see the psychiatrist. (Nice way to hold parents hostage.) She has a therapist she's seeing once a week also. 

Why am I going on and on? Because her dad and I are at a loss as to what's happening to our daughter. I'm not 100% behind the major depressive psychosis since she has none of the other symptoms. But the only other causes for her age, that I'm aware of, are pretty much schizophrenia or a brain tumor! (I'd love a CT scan just to make sure, but no one will order it.) I'm looking for anyone who knows anything about adolescents with hallucinations or has had any personal experiences. I'm an exhausted mama who feels so helpless. I don't feel like anyone is taking this seriously enough while my poor little girl is suffering greatly. ",04Feb2019,1

157,"You know that lady who changes her mind six times before she orders a coffee? Or the friend who can’t decide whether she wants to go on a road trip with you or not? Or the work colleague who obsesses over the new haircut that she hates? Or the person who cancels on your movie date at the last minute? You may call her annoying, but 18 months ago that person was me. I couldn’t make a decision to save my life, because that’s what anxiety looks like.

I think that I was born predisposed to anxiety, but perhaps it would not have smashed me the way it did had my life not been filled with what once felt like an unending rollercoaster of grief and trauma.

Or maybe it would have. I’m not sure.

Eighteen months ago, I thought I was crazy. I went from someone who had a successful career in child welfare and emergency veterinary nursing, to someone who couldn’t even go to the shopping centre alone. I went from a cardio gym-junky and health food guru, to a person who would completely freak out every time someone picked up a knife or a pair of scissors. I went from being completely independent and living alone, to someone who was scared to be alone.

It’s taken me 540 days to feel brave enough to write about my mental health breakdown-or as my close friends and I call it, my Brittney-Spears-head-shaving-fiasco. I know that all things related to mental illness are not easy, but it was anxiety and intrusive thoughts that absolutely rocked me to the core of my very being. Soul-crushingly tough and embarrassing to talk about – hence, why it’s taken me almost two years to share my story.

The anxiety I’ve experienced throughout my life has never really been textbook, or should I say, it has never been social media text book-because that is a thing, right? I’ve never experienced a full-blown panic attack, I’ve never hyperventilated, I’ve never been struck with blurry vision or sweating. For me, it was a little nausea and increased heartrate, but mostly it was a head so full of thoughts that I would sometimes feel completely out of control, so much so that at times all I wanted was to go to sleep and never wake up.

In 2017, following an abdominal surgery and 10 weeks off work, things really started to become unbearable. I would often have thoughts of slashing-not cutting, but uncontrollably slashing my arms and my feet – and I’d even sometimes have thoughts of hurting my cat, Levi. Anyone who knows me knows how much I adore my cat, he has been my closest companion for many years, so why would I ever want to hurt the one who holds so much of my heart?

The truth is, I wouldn’t. But anxiety is all about, ‘What if?’

“WHAT IF you kill your cat? How could you live with yourself? WHAT IF you drive off a bridge, but you don’t die and you’re paralysed? WHAT IF you grow old and go to a nursing home where the staff hurt you? WHAT IF your brothers die… wait do they even like you anyway? No one likes you. Everyone you have ever loved has died or left you. WHAT IF it’s all your fault?”

And no, I wasn’t hearing voices, I was suffering with anxiety and intrusive thoughts: Unwanted, horrific and disgusting thoughts. Thoughts that scared the life out of me. It was as if my mind had been hijacked and I got to a point where my mind was confused with reality, and it was scary.

Really scary.

Horrible and gruesome scenarios would often come and go, and at first, I fought hard to continue on with my busy life. Of course, no one would have ever known how bad the disaster zone of my mind really was. I tried giving up coffee, natural remedies, yoga – lots of yoga, prayer, but to be honest, nothing worked; and I went from an independent woman who had once travelled the world on her own, to a fragile girl who was scared of everything – especially her own mind.

The more I tried to harness these thoughts of gore and suicide the more savage they would become. I guess it is kind of like when someone tells you that you can think about anything in the entire world, but you are not to think about a puppy – what are you going to think about? Yes, a puppy. Well, that was sort of like what was happening to me, but I wasn’t thinking of a cute little puppy…

From what I have read, these types of intrusive thoughts are actually pretty normal – everyone has them, but more often than not they come and go too quickly for you to catch; but for someone with anxiety these thoughts don’t just come and go, they linger and the longer they linger, the more you focus on them and therefore the more you panic. It’s a nasty cycle.

At first, I was too embarrassed to tell anyone about my state of mind, mostly because I didn’t want people to think that I was some psychotic monster, but also because I’d always prided myself on being strong – I’d lost so much in my life, but I was always strong and I was always kind, someone to be admired; or, so I craved. Eventually I got to a point of breaking where I had to choose: choose to live or choose to die, because in between was too hard.

I chose to live.

I called my aunty who lives on the Central Coast (about an hour north of where I was living) and I asked her for help. She then graciously invited me to come and stay with her. So, I resigned from a job that I loved, I packed up everything I owned and I brought a second-hand caravan (‘Two trailer park girls go ‘round the outside…’ Yeah, I know!) and with the help of my cousin, I renovated my soon to be home, and we moved my gypsy van onto my auntie’s property.

The renovating process in itself was very therapeutic, but I needed more than just physical labour; so, I found an amazing local GP and she prescribed me with anti-anxiety medication. And although starting the medication was really scary, it was my only option – live or die, remember. Each morning, with the encouragement of my cousin and my aunty and uncle, I would gingerly take half of my prescribed dose.

Fast forward a few weeks and I started going to the shopping centre, but never alone. I reignited my love for almond chai lattes and thus gave me an excuse to visit the shops every day. It took about a month for me to start to visit the shops alone, and part of that courage was fuelled by the girls at the local café. They were nice girls and I knew that if I felt unsafe whilst doing my groceries, I could go to them – yes, they were sort of strangers, but I trusted them. Earth angels.

My medication was increased twice and although I was very wary, I followed my doctors’ orders – live or die. Within time I started exercising again, I began with walking my cousins’ gorgeous dog, Bo. The therapy and feeling of safety that an animal can bestow on you is unfathomable.

I’d like to tell you that the intrusive thoughts stopped straight away, but they didn’t, however they did ease.

After three months of not working I decided to return to casual work. Counselling children was too intense for someone recovering from mental illness, so I returned to my other love, veterinary nursing (yes, animals and children, no wonder I had a breakdown, right?!!) that being said, before my first shift I had no idea how I would react to being back in surgery. It turned out that I was fine. Work was good for me, it kept my mind busy. I am now currently working fulltime in both general and emergency veterinary nursing. Maybe one day I’ll return to counselling, maybe I won’t. I’m not sure yet.

My recovery has been a journey. A journey of choices – live or die? A journey of tiny steps – one almond chai latte at a time. A journey of being brave, of being real with myself. And I am doing so much better. Have I recovered completely? Well, I’m still taking my medication. I enjoy taking my medication, I see it as a blessing, so if I’m on it forever I’m completely ok with that. Last year I travelled interstate on my own and last week I drove to Sydney on my own (this in itself makes almost every person I know anxious!) and in September I plan to travel overseas on my own. My anxiety and intrusive thoughts have gone, but I think that mental health preservation will be eternally on my agenda, and it should be on yours too.

We, collectively are humanity and we must learn to be real: real with ourselves and real with each other without fear of rejection; we must learn to listen without judgment and love without agenda – everyone has a story.

If you are experiencing intrusive thoughts believe me when I say, you are not your thoughts – and you are not alone; neither do you have to yield to them or be defined by them. YOU are beautifully and wonderfully made. And although you might feel crazy and feel like you want to die right now, be brave and choose life. There is a plan for you, I promise.

158,"I've had my ups and downs but now I'm at a complete standstill. Everytime I get passed a ""big problem"" in my head, something new or old fills the void. My therapist told me these are ""displaced emotions."" I described it as my mind latches onto whatever negative thing I can think of first and fixates to justify my sadness or anger or whatever negative emotions I feel. That being said, I'm pretty much spent at this point. I'm miserable. I can't get over events from my past and I can't stop feeling so shitty. My spouse is so extraordinarily supportive but I can't do it anymore. I waste every ounce of goodwill given to me and I am so obsessed with past events it's insane. My spouse has no one here but me and yet I can't stop being such a downer and nutjob it's destroying her life. She might not see it, but god damn I am a mess. I feel sick to my stomach and want to no longer exist more than anything.

Just over a year ago, I was relatively successful career wise and excited about my next move. I was happy, confident, and sure of myself. I knew I was ""somebody"" and that despite it all, my flaws or problems or things that didn't work out, my mantra of ""life goes on"" was true. Now, it's a curse. I can't stop stressing and worrying 24/7. I am so afraid of upsetting my loved ones. My best friend of like 12 years told me they are no longer my friend. I just cried for like a half hour about a dog we surrendered, regretted it, and were unable to get her back because my wife made a passing comment about it like a week ago. Yet, days prior I had seen pictures from that era and didn't really think twice. I'm completely fragile now. I don't even know what will set me off. I'm so completely scared of myself and my future. I feel like I never engage my wife or make her happy, and when I spend time playing Xbox with friends or myself I feel like dogshit. 

I am convinced I need to be admitted to a state hospital at this point. I can't take care of myself, let alone those who depend on me. I am not a contributing member to society but I can't seem to find any traction to get admitted somewhere. On top of that, my spouse would end up screwed over financially and I would just ruin more lives in the process. 

I'm so lost. I don't understand these feelings or why my mind thinks how it does. I'm so full of regret and shame and guilt and pain. I tested high for depression and anxiety, and have been told I have PTSD. I was prescribed cymbalta but I'm afraid to take meds and the doc said they didn't care if I took it or not, said it was my call.

And as far as i can remember, i have anger issues, and slowly I'm starting loosing my mind. I always think about killing but never did something, i had my times when i was really angry and catch myself thinking how to kill my dogs or family, but i would simply isolate myself from them until this kind of stuff end.

161,"I've always been a pretty depression-prone person, even as a kid. Since puberty, I have had issues with anger, ruminating on things, and connecting with other people. But last January, during my freshman year of college, was the first time I went in to a fully fledged depression. For two months, I was crying pretty much every night and often during the day, I wasn't taking care of myself hygiene-wise, and was generally a zombified nightmare to be around. However, after finding a new passion and making a lot of very good friends over the rest of the semester and the summer, I pulled myself out of the hole. I basically threw myself into my schoolwork and professional development. Since then, I have been the most academically and professionally successful I have ever been. I was pretty sure that I was happy. I have been reflecting on and thinking of that depression last year as something that was over and that I had learned from. The problem is that I realized I'm still living in fear of its return. If I have even a day where I am not doing a lot of work I feel that spiral of depression thinking slink back into my brain. This weekend, I did only an hour or two of work and spent the rest of the day out with friends or ""relaxing"" but I couldn't stop my mind from going to those places that made me catatonic this time last year.

I know this isn't healthy..... 

As the title says, I'm about to break up with my longterm boyfriend. I am 100% certain that I want to break up, but I feel so so bad about doing it :( I also don't really know how to initiate the conversation. In the past, my bf has completely shut down when I have tried to bring up anything that bothers me, and manages to flip it around and guilt trip me. He tries to make himself into a martyr by saying things like ""I know I'm not good enough for you.... I hate myself"" etc. So somehow, our relationship problems get pushed to the backburner and I end up comforting HIM. 

Anyway, his manipulative tactics definitely get into my head and make me feel shitty for even bringing up our issues, even if it's just through a calm, rational conversation. I'm at my wit's end; I don't know what to do at this point. Please help me so I can move on with my life without wallowing in guilt :(

Perhaps not „actively” as in: actually cutting myself or hanging myself, but it’s exhausting to function in any way and it’s especially hard to have to force myself to move from the path of a moving car etc. A lot of my mental power is just used to avoid „passive suicide” like that or just literally trying not to lie down on the floor and not move again.

166,"I'll try and explain the situation as best as I can. We are both 22. 

Me and ""Ben"" have always been good friends. It started in middle school where we just instantly clicked and we have maintained this friendship throughout high school and university as well. As a result, I've always felt like I could discern when something was going on in his life or when something was bothering him.

Over the past few weeks, and even months, I have been noticing some concerning changes in the way he has been acting and who he has been spending time with, etc.

It's almost as if he goes through periods where he is super paranoid about things, for example a couple weeks ago he was telling me how he thinks that his parents are trying to sabotage his university studies because they don't like what he chose to study. He didn't go super into detail regarding his parents, but he said that he thinks that his parents are intentionally causing him stress by burdening him with family issues so he will not be able to focus on his studies. As well that his parents are ""probably"" talking to his professors about him and ""influencing"" their opinions of him. 

He also accused me of wanting to sleep with his ex-girlfriend, which I have NO interest in as I have been with the same girl for almost three years. He of course didn't have any proof of this so he did drop it. Just super bizarre and out of place statements like that. 

Two weekends ago, he asked me if I wanted to go to a party at a friend's house. I said sure because I like to have a good time as well and honestly I knew he had started hanging out with some new people so I was also curious about who they were and he was practically begging me to go to the party with him, so I did. 

Well, when we get there, I immediately can tell that it is a ""bad scene"", so to speak. There was a lot of bizarre and sketchy people there and I just felt super uncomfortable. At one point, Ben told me he was going to the bathroom, and when he came back, he was acting super wired and accelerated. He was definitely on some kind of drug, but what kind I'm not sure as I'm pretty naïve on the subject. 

Another situation that I can think of is that he has starting dating this girl, who is so extremely not his type it's uncanny, and after two weeks of knowing her, already has a tattoo relating to her. Incredibly fast and weird relationship that I honestly see spinning out of control. 

All of these stories to say that I don't know what is going on with Ben. A lot of this behaviour is super uncharacteristic of him. I know he has struggled before, but not like this. All of this behavior has almost been escalating to a point now where all of this stuff is happening and I don't know how to help him or what to even say to him about my concerns (if anything). 


Do you think I'm overreacting with my concerns? If not, do you think I should try and talk to Ben about my worries? What should I say to him/how should I say it?

tl;dr: My friend's behavior is spinning out of control and I'm worried about his mental health. ",04Feb2019,1
167,I show a lot of signs of BPD as well as being diagnosed with depression and anxiety but I’m not taken seriously because I’m young. I tried to seek medical help but I was disregarded and it fucking kills. I don’t want to keep on living and I’m basically out of options. ,04Feb2019,1

169,"To put this post as short as possible, I’ve been self harming since I was 13y/o. I’m 23 this year. Sure I haven’t been self harming non-stop, There have been breaks here and there for months/years etc. But it’s the only thing I would ever say I have ever been addicted to and it is my only coping mechanism. My mother drinks and smokes to cope and is addicted and I understand it only because of my self harm problems. She obviously doesn’t approve of my self harm (nor do I hers) and wishes i didn’t do it but has never made me feel horrifically guilty for them which in my opinion makes me less likely to in the future. As well as this, she is super understanding that both mine and her addictions/coping mechanisms are equally as harmful and bad for our health as the other, just one is clearly more visual.

My boyfriend however is the absolute worst. He seriously lacks empathy. He will be so quick to tell me he hates it when I do it (fair enough) but will also threaten me with leaving me if I continue to do it - as if that will stop me when I’m blacking out from overwhelming emotion and practically in the same mindset as someone who’s going to kill themselves. I always try to explain to him that like any time he’s stressed or we argue he will go have a cigarette to “cool down” “because he needs it badly” that it’s literally the same thing, a coping mechanism. He used to be understanding for a time and even said “if you don’t self harm I won’t smoke anymore” and honestly? That kinda helped for a while. Because I wasn’t stopping myself for me anymore, I was stopping entirely for him. But then it became toxic when it came to a time when he caved and was like “this is too much I’m going for a fag” and I was left feeling like there wasn’t anything to stop me.

It’s especially hard for me because I spent a long time having every time I opened up to my mum her drinking or smoking more and that made me feel like I was the entire reason for her addictions. And for him to do the same with smoking every time we argue reminds me of that pain and it gets too much at times. And I always feel like I deserve it for making everyone struggle so much they have to resort to their coping mechanisms.

Would appreciate some advice. If you agree/don’t agree. But either way just a bit of a rant.",04Feb2019,1
170,"TL;DR: The story below is an optional read, only loosely related to the question. Big question is how do you all feel about meditation? Has it helped any of you? If so, how did you start?

Let me tell you all a story. I'm 23, am in college, and I have classes Monday-Friday. On Mondays and Wednesdays, I have a Plant Taxonomy class, with a relatively strict professor that has a locked-door policy (if you're late for class, you aren't getting in), and a no-makeup policy if you miss a quiz, exam, or lab (unless you have a really good, documented reason). Well, today, right before that class, I got hit pretty hard by a panic attack (have a panic disorder). I was supposed to take a quiz at the very beginning of class, so I could not be late and could not skip class. I walked to his office 5 minutes before class and said something along the lines of ""I'm sorry for springing this on you, I don't have this documented with the university, but I have a panic disorder and am beginning to have a panic attack right now. Is there any way I can wait outside and try to ride this out and rejoin the class when this passes?"" And he said ""Well, we have a quiz you know."" I said ""I know, this directly conflicts, and I can grit my teeth and try to power through it in class if I need to, but it's going to be incredibly uncomfortable."" He said I could wait outside the room, he'd call me in for lecture when the quiz was finished, and I could take the quiz at the end of class. So I sit outside, try to calm down. He finally calls me in, I sit in lecture and take notes, and then start to relapse and have another attack. I stay seated and try to ignore it, but its growing bigger and bigger the longer I sit there. By the end of class, my chest is aching terribly, I feel like vomiting, and I'm sweating profusely. He says ""I'll be ready to give you the quiz in about 10 minutes. Okay?"" I hesitated and said ""Sir, my chest has been aching terribly the entire time. I understand if I can't make the quiz up, but I'm debating going to a doctor, this isn't typical."" Surprisingly he said okay, for me not to worry about the quiz, go to the doctor and make sure I'm okay and I can take the quiz Wednesday. He ended up being extremely nice and understanding, but I wanted to get through the semester without having to tell a professor I'm having a panic attack, as it was very embarrassing for me. I really don't want that to happen again.

All that to say this: is meditation a viable option for staving off these attacks? Has it helped any of you?",04Feb2019,1

174,"So I met with a psychiatrist for the first time today and was prescribed Zoloft. I’ve dealt with low grade but long term depression and anxiety for many years and have been in counseling. I agree with the decision to try medication, but I’m wondering if it would be a good idea to wait until after a vacation I have planned next week. I’m worried about potential side effects completely ruining the vacation instead of my normal gnawing anxiety. ",04Feb2019,1
175,"My self destructive thoughts tend to stem from my hatred towards my condition. So as easy as it might sound to “just be positive” or “just smile”, let me tell you, that it’s absolutely not. It’s hard to accept that no matter what I do, for the rest of my life, I’m going to be in limbo with my emotions. It’s extremely difficult especially because my mood swings don’t have a rhyme or reason, I just start feeling a certain type of way and then in turn, the self destructive thoughts start back up because I’m pissed at myself for always being a downer. The last couple of months have been bad for me. I stopped taking my meds, which caused me to have not only my bipolar symptoms, but I was also going through withdrawals. I dosed back onto them, and for the first week I felt really good. After that, it’s like I’m right back to where I was mentally when I wasn’t taking them. Extremely terrible depression. I’ve been in a low and stuck there for 2 months. I’ve pretty much withdrawn from most everyone at this point, because I feel like being around me is just too draining. And I get so tired of being told to smile. If I’m gonna smile, it’s gonna be because I feel happy. Not to make you feel more comfortable in my presence. I know that most of my issue is that my medication is off now, but thanks to the lovely healthcare system, I cannot even see my psychiatrist until the middle of April. So here I am, already 2 months into an extreme low, and still have 2 more months of just sucking it up and dealing with feeling like a piece of shit until I can get my medication situation figured out. 
Moral of my story here... 
to anyone who may think that I’m being grouchy/bitchy/a downer because I barely say I word, (&amp; apparently have resting bitch face) I really hope that you can understand that I’m just doing my best to exist right now. I’m constantly fighting an internal conflict that feels like it will never end. If you see me crying, don’t worry, it could be any one of my 20 billion emotions causing the tears, and it’ll probably pass very soon. 
Please don’t ask me what’s wrong, most of the time I don’t even know and that’s the most frustrating part about it. 
I’m sorry, because I feel like a total bummer, man. And that’s the last thing I ever want to be. But I’m here. I’m trying my fucking hardest. And I’m not quitting. So don’t quit on me. Please.",04Feb2019,1

Maybe things would actually finally improve.

Just seems that that was the quiet before the next storm, I'm sad every night and sometimes sad in the day too now, I feel like a big sack of worthless shit and those dark thoughts briefly made a return earlier.

Hey guys, its me Mr.Throwaway here. (I mean I don't really know why I'm using a throwaway, only two of my friends know my actual reddit account, and my story is so fuckin specific and my typing and that username might be a dead giveaway, so if they do read it they will probably suspect its me straight away, but if they were to ask if this was me I'd just deny it and because I said that here they would be like ""HMMMMM"" but because they wont be able to be 100% sure it was me I think it would be funny, anyway my thowaway username is way better than my main)The title may sound exaggerated and maybe a little Cliche, but I really do feel like I'm sabotaging myself. I've alwayshad mental health issues but they really manifested themselves around the end of highschool and when I first started College (I'm from the UK so I was 16). In Highschool I was bullied alot and I started to get alot of anxiety and self-confidence issues, this all came to a head when it was the day of my Physics GCSE exam. In Highschool I \*LOVED\* physics It was my dream to go on to become a physicist and I had my whole life planned ahead of me, in year 10 I got awarded with a university bursary, which would mean if I went on to study physics in University I would be granted 6 grand, which was pretty sweet especially because the bursary was supposed to be given to the year 11 student who showed the most prospect but it was given to me instead (which was kinda awkward cos I had to go to the end of year, year 11 awards ceremony to pick up an award when I was in year 10 I was so scared xD) because of this my dad and his wife would always brag about me to everybody whenever I visited. Physics felt like it was all they talked about when I visited which was kinda weird, I never really bonded with my dad much but it was nice to see him so proud of me but it did put a tonne of pressure on me. The thing is though, is that although I was getting excellent grades in physics, my grades in maths were faltering. All of the above kinda cumulated into my first (of many) panic attacks in my life. It was 4 hours before my exam and I was about to go in early to study with my friends, when I Froze in front of my front door for about ten minutes before walking into the kitchen and sitting down for 3 hours not able to work out what was happening. I sat there for hours, before my older sister, who due to some pretty fucked up family issues I never got along with that well, found me and gave me a pep talk, It really meant alot to hear that from her, I always felt unloved by my sister but that meant the world to me. I ran to school and arrived maybe 30 or 40 minutes before my exam and all of my friends were waiting for me worried sick, I burst into tears  I wasnt able to concieve what in the ever loving fuck just happened, and hugged all of them, I was a pretty closed off guy back then so that actually was a big thing for me, I cried until the exam began, I aced that exam btw. (well kind of I was 2% of an A\* so I only got an A but I'm not picky an A was great)

Some similar shit happened after that, but I got counselling from a teacher and my mum organized for me to see some doctors in the summer holidays, but for some unknown reason I just couldn't express myself,  I couldn't Pry my fucking problems from my mind, I knew something was wrong but I could never figure it out. So my issues were just pinned to Anxiety, and I was Sent to group counseling for a few months which just made me feel worse.

Anyway, when college started, I loved it, I wasn't bullied anymore I made alot of friends and I was only doing subjects I was interested in (Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Maths, The four fuckin horsemen). But my physics and maths grades started to plummet, and I kept on forgetting homework, and I started finding it harder and harder to get in on time. Eventually more and more occasions like that physics exam one started popping up. One time I froze outside my maths class and stood there for 50 odd minutes before running off and crying in the park, and one other time as soon as I saw the college as I was walking there, I had a panic attack and just sat in a back alley crying looking through fuckin LoL item builds for like 4 hours until I could go home without my mum realising I hadnt gone in. It was like I was trapped in my own mind, like I was someone else entirely looking out of a foggy window SCREAMING at my self to just fucking move but nothing it was fucking torturous. Eventually it all got too much for me and I spent more and more time avoiding college until I stopped going all together. This was around Christmas. That December was the first time in my life I had ever Contemplated suicide, it sounds dumb but you see, it felt like my life was crashing down around me, my life long goal snatched away, I felt like I had disappointed my family and my friends, I was confused about my future for the first time in my life, and on top of that the depression that had been growing for that last year or so was worse than ever, like a god damn black hole in my gut ripping me apart. Eventually, I realised though that, even though I wanted to die, I was scared of dying without a idk legacy of sorts? I don't want to die without leaving an impact, like as selfish as it sounds I've fantasised about how much I'd love to sacrifice my life to save someone else, not because of some selfless heroic nature inside me, but because I'd die but I'd also be seen as a hero and remembered when I die, so because of that, I pushed forward desperate to get my life back from myself.  


It took me Idk three months or so? Something like that for me to recover from the Pit I was in I was helped out by a new friend I met who eventually became my first girlfriend which was nice, she helped me feel better about talking about my problems and opening up, and also being with her really boosted my confidence (omg I said that they wouldnt be 100% sure but that last point was so fuckin specific there would be no doubt in their fuckin minds WHY IS THIS ON A THROWAWAY WHEN IM NOT HOLDING BACK THESE KEY BITS OF INFO, I guess its hard not to? I mean I could of written this more vague but idk I like going into more detail.)   
Anyway come that spring/summer I was applying to get back into that same college, eventually I succeeded and got into a triple science BTEC the qualification wasnt as good as the 3 science A level I wanted but that was fine as long as I got to do science, I had realised now that I wanted to learn psychology I wanted to do anything in my power that no one would have to go through this sshit this awful life I was going through. However many of the teachers there had heavy doubts after what happened the year before and it was incredibly hard to persuade them that I should come back and that I could handle another year, it was only the help of an incredibly nice and supportive teacher I had the year before vouching for me, that they changed their minds. Right now I don't blame the teachers that had their doubts, but back then I was so fuckin angry  that they would try and get in the way of me trying again, because back then I \*KNEW\* I would succeed that second time, I mean I COULDNT fail, especially after how I felt the last time, God knows how awful I would of felt if this happened again, but as you can probably guess I did, I did fail again, it took me a couple of months longer to crack this time, but in the Spring, due to my Steadily Decreasing Performance, and attendance, due to the exact same reasons as the year before I was expelled during a very tearful meeting between me, my mother and my teachers.    
That year wasnt a complete failure as that year it was the first time I opened up to my friends about my issues, one of my proudest moments of my life was when I was walking to class, when I suddenly froze hid in a corner and burst into tears, instead of hiding or running away like I would usually do, I texted my friend asking him to walk me to class. He came out of the cafeteria straight away, ignored the fact I was crying said hi like he would usually and said ""aight, lets go to class"" he talked to me about everday stuff and treated me like a normal person, he didnt patronise me or worry over me, he just walked me to class. When we arrived I gathered my self for 5 minutes while he talked to me before I gave him a hug and went in. I was super proud that for the first but sadly last time, in my life I won over whatever the fuck happened to me. On top of this I started 1 on 1 counseling and group counseling, I never felt group counseling to be very helpful, but 1 on 1 counseling was quite helpful.

There's a problem with 1 on 1 counselling I had though is actually something that I don't think I've mentioned yet. I feel like I'm multiple people, which is weird, the two ""people"" feel like they have the same personalities but also like they completely lack empathy for each other. As in one moment I will be begging my self to get over my fear of dying without an impact because I just WANT to die, crying and crying, staring at a wall, my heart going crazy, being in a deep foggy swamp, unable to move forward, the fog so dense that I can barely see my hands in front of my face, just wanting to lie down, give up and drown, but the thought that I might be just 10 more minutes from a reprieve to this hell that keeps me going, and then 5 minutes later I'll be laughing and ignoring anything happened. To clarify, I always feel that blackhole in my gut, but when it starts to suck me in I feel like another person, unaware that anything was EVER ok, begging to be saved but not being able to go into the next room and ask my mum to save me. Suffering in silence KNOWING IT WILL ALL BE BETTER IF I GET HELP BUT UNABLE. But as soon as that goes away I know I felt bad, but I don't care I think its funny, I laugh at myself, I know that I SHOULD CARE but the fact I know I should care but dont want to try and care makes me laugh the absurdity of my situation is so fucking funny to me, and its SO HARD to remember the times when I'm Swampy,  when I'm feeling ok, If I try if I REALLY try I can force myself to remember, but I rarely think to do that, and usually it ends up with me entering a bad state. On top of this my none bad self has an uncanny ability to not give a shit about anything, or maybe thats the wrong way of putting it, I am almost afraid of caring. See usually I enter these bad states when I think too much, which is why I often bombard myself with stimuli as when I have a lack of something to occupy my Brain, my ears and my eyes I start to freak, which makes it so fucking hard to do stuff like play guitar and draw and read and write and design my DnD stuff and Painting my models and designing shit and researching science and history and clean and wash and do normal shit. Anyway as soon as I start thinking about my life and things I need to do I start to freak out, I really have to think HARD to occupy all of my brain and ONNE HUNDRED PERCENT focus on something or have distractions while I'm doing something otherwise my brain will start going into bad places and I'll start to think about that black hole and The fog will return. So caring is not really something I enjoy as a lot of the times that includes alot of thinking, and especially when said caring is caring about my own future and myself so I tend to avoid caring and thinking about myself because that means I'll start to think about that bad. (However one exception to this no thinking thing is talking, I LOVE TALKING TO PEOPLE, even if Im an anxious little dongus, and as weird as it sounds, I fantasise about talking to people about things I enjoy and kind of talk to my self about the things Im interested in and would love to think over more, which in itself allows me to think about that shit. (However one exception to this talking to myself being an exception to the no thinking thingy is that whenever I talk to my self about myself, I am no longer fantasising about talking to others, I am straight up having a conversation with myself about my self hatred and how FRUSTRATED I am and how retardly absurd and funny I find it all, but how much I feel like I'm suffering but how I feel like I'm weak for suffering like this, BUT HOW I KNOW IM NOT WEAK FOR SUFFERING LIKE THIS EVERYBODY WOULD, I know that but I keep telling myself that I am weak. Also it doesnt feel like the two mes that are talking are 2 different people, It feels like Im talking to myself and debating myself about the things about myself Im unsure about which is everything? God I dont tfucking know.))   ( I imagine all my use of weird brackets in weird places is confusing, I hope its not even though, I'm actively, currently doing it, I just like writing how I would talk, I go on a lot of tangents, but then again, I could edit this and get rid of all this confusing shit, but idk I dont want to, it wouldnt feel natural, I want this message to come directly out of my head, I don't want it to read like a history essay or someshit, Idek why tbh Its not like it would take away from anything.)  
Jesus fuck back to the point, So this poses 4 problems with counseling and even seeing doctors. One would be when Im freaking out in a bad place, whatever, I physically, well mentally, but kind of physically cant go. If I had an appointment tomorrow and I had to get up at say, 6AM, I'd probably get up at 6AM, but if that day I started to get enveloped, fog would slowly start to Wrap around my head, I'd mindlessly get ready to set off but all while I am doing so I will be actively telling myself in my head, ""you can't go in, you wont, you know you wont, you know how you feel, its impossible."" and I'll keep getting dressed, not in a rush VERY SLOWLY like a fucking zombie ,all while telling myself ""No, shut the fuck up, Im going to iM going I CANT NOT GO I NEED TO""   
but why am i not in a rush, I havent put my coat or my shoes on yet and I was supposed to leave 20 minutes ago, ""Why are you still getting ready, you know you cant make it, you have failed again"" and at this point, I will either give up, curl into a ball and let the fog fill me until my mum eventually comes into my room and says something like ""wasnt you supposed to go????"", and Im not the type to lie, I used to lie to my mum about why I wasnt going places, but nowadays I just tell her, shes always disapointed in me. If I leave I will make my way there as normal SHOUTING IN MY HEAD ITS ALL OK IM JUST GOING TO ARRIVE AND ITS ALL GOING TO BE FINE, But I do know that I wont go in when i get there, the only reason I left the house is to comfort my self to pretend for 10 minutes that im not a pathetic waste of space, that I can do it, but I know I cant, and Ill arrive Ill see the location, my heart will sink and Ill turn around and walk home.   
And the other problem is that if I wake up not feeling bad, I'll still get ready, but I wont rush I wont even think ""errr its 7am already you NEED TO GO NOW"" I wont think of the time, Ill just mindlessly thoughtlessly follow the motions with as many distractions as possible, and when I leave the house, Ill put on music, (I cant leave the house without music, I need something to listen to, and without music without that to listen to all the noises i hear outside will freak me out and Ill start going into a bad place) Usually as soon as that music is in my ears and Im outside, Ill notice the time ""WHY THE FUCK DID I LET IT GET THIS LATE"" Ill freak out and rush to the appointment in a panic. Very rarely Im on time, usually Im late, When Im late I start to think I cant help but think what are they going to say whats going to happen I should be there Im not Im late, I begin to entrap myself once again, Frozen I dont know what to do, sometimes I do go in when Im late most of the time I dont  
On top of that, If i even get to the session, I'm usually in a calm state, because heres the thing I get anxious BEFORE I get there once I arrive, Im calm as can be, but as soon as I get asked ""so whats up"" or ""whats the issue"" or whatever, I go blank, what the fuck is the issue???? I mean there is one, I know, its my mental health theres something up with it, what is it what is it. usually when a doctor asks me that I go silent for a few seconds get frustrated and  say something along the lines of ""I dont know, I think, maybe, I mean its like Depression and anxiety I guess, BUT ITS NOT JUST THAT, but I guess its just depression and anxiety...."" and they either give me a perscription for anti depressants or tell me to go to group counseling. The one on one, Counseling is better, when they ask me whats up, I struggle to answer and they see that, they pull answers out of me, usually after a counseling session I FEEL LIKE MYSELF, because Im tellingthem about my problems and that puts me into a little bit of a bad place, but the fact Im talking to someone about it, naturally Im joking about it, Im laughing about it, which puts me inbetween these two places. When Im on my own I cant Laugh and joke AND think about it, but when im in a counseling session they force me to in a way. But again that usually takes the majority of the session to get me into that state. ive only ever had two one on one counsellors, 1 was just a highschool, history teacher who cared and allowed me to speak to them, I will never forget them, and the other was a College counsellor who I got told to have sessions with after my first failure. She was always worried when I would laugh about my suffering and about my self hatred and my situation, she thought I had some kind of dissociative dissorder and understood my problems talking to doctors so gave me a letter to give to them explaining her experience counseling me, but the doctors told me that she was wrong and said it was probably just depression and anxiety. I was always laughing about it, she never saw me in a bad state, until one day my then girlfriend found me, frozen in the prison of my own mind, I can barely remember it, but she Grabbed me picked me up and took me to the counsellor, the counsellor saw how much of a wreck I was, I was not in that body at the time, felt like I was watching through third person, tears swelling, mouth gaping, eyes red, shaking, when she saw me she rescheduled her current appointment and brought me in to talk to, I was in that state for maybe 5 10 minutes talking toher before in a SNAP, I wiped away the tears, apologised for the inconvienence laughed about how much of a nuisance I must of been, and started joking about the situation, I KNEW how fucking strange that was, but I didnt particularly care, it was really REALLY funny.   
Also I just remembered this and didnt know where to put it, but one time maybe a month ago I was in my room when I started to fall into that black hole, I silently Cried and cried it was the worst I felt in years (the start of this story happened in 2015 so its been about 4 years) anyway, I was wracking my mind trying to convince my self to let my dreams of making a name for myself and leaving a legacy go and just fucking kill myself and end the suffering, I told my self how ridiculous I was sounding, I  cant I CANT DO THAT JESUS, when I suddenly thought ""my fucking god I NEED TO TELL SOMEONE NOW i NEED TO JUST TELL MY MUM, but I wont will I? Ill just start laughing and not caring and just fucking open a youtube video"" thats when I smiled to my self and was like ""omg im literally doing that now ahahahahah FUCKING HELL THIS IS SO RETARDED AHAHAHAHAH I CANT BELIEVE IM THIS FUCKED UP AHAHAHAHAH"" so thats probably like a problem? I mean Im laughing about that as Im writing this.  


ANYFUCKINWAY JESUS, when we last left of the TIMELINE, I had just failed to get through my second year of college, Shortly after this, I started to isolate myself, I really started to hate myself and because of this I distanced myself from my then girlfriend and unfortunately we broke up, tough break, it was a fuckinnnnggg rough breakup as well, but we are all cool now  it was mostly my fault it was so rough. On top of all this, I hadnt succeeded to get through a year of college twice in a row now and my friends were all moving on to university, they were all so successful and I was so proud of them all, BUT SO GOD DAMN ENVIOUS, I DREAMED ALWAYS DREAMED OF GOING TO UNIVERSITY, GETTING A PHYSICS OR A PSYCHOLOGY OR A FILM DEGREE IM INTERESTED IN SO MANY THINGS I JUST WANTED TO LEARN AND GET QUALIFIED AND EXPERIENCE THAT UNIVERSITY LIFE. so that summer I was in a REAL bad place, but I gathered my self, I told my self, that I was going to I WAS I NEEDED TO, succeed that third time, the college I was in wouldnt let me get a 3rd year, So i had to move to a different one, no biggy, unfortunately they didnt think me capable of doing a triple A level or a triple BTEC course so instead they said the only course I was capable to was a health and social care qualification (which to be fair was kind of fucking insulting to those in the health and social course, what are they less than triple Science guys??? I mean christ people in the health and social course have to do internships in old peoples homes and in mental health care places on top of their coursework which isnt exactly fucking easy, Imsure if they can succeed in that they can succeed in the triple science fuck AND I Heard that same story in a lot of the students many of them wanted to do A levels but told that the health and social care BTEC was the only thing they were capable of, fucking bastards). The thing is with this third time is that by now I was 18 turning 19, while the people I was in class with were like 16, on top of this I knew no one in the college and soon as all my friends were now living successful lives in their universities I was all alone, and it was incredibly hard to make friends with anyone in that class, because for one Im awful at approaching people and 2 all of them were fucking cunts xD. Well not all of them, most of them were quite nice admitedly my personality just clashed with many of theirs, only one or two of them were really cunty, HOWEVER I did make one friend in that university, she was basically me but with tits so we got along quite famously xD. Unfortunately though she moved to a different college (we still hang out every now and again) so I was alone again apart from the few times I managed to meet her or go join my friends in uni, but those occasions while amazing were rare, as Im not exactly from a rich family, and the times Ive tried working I fucked it up fast and was fucking terrorfied, which I still find pathetic cos i dont want people to think Im lazy, I swear im not fucking lazy i just cant do it.

Eventually I sabotaged my self again though, It was maybe this time last year when I stopped going to college again, when I failed again. I always used to say "" Hey, third times the charm right??? WHAT COULD GO WRONG "" Id laugh, I \*KNEW\* I was going to succeed that third time, I didnt have a doubt in my mind, Until well I failed. shortly after that I visited my friends uni flat, I think we played poker, and played a little bit of super seducer, and laughed and we might of filmed something for one of the rarty Films i make , and as I lay on their sofa at night, everyone was asleep, I cried, all their friends were so nice, EVERYTHING WAS SO NICE, I just wished I could be with them, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE US THREE AGAINST THE WORLD,  They are so much better than I am, I love them so much because they can get through anything, I dont tell them enough, I layed on their sofa knowing I wouldnt be able to go through a 4th time I begged my self to just go to their kitchen and slit my wrists, I BEGGED AND I BEGGED BUT I COULDNT DO IT, I CANT.  


I havent mentioned my father since one ofthe first paragraphs, hes not a big part of my life, but I do visit him maybe once or twice a year for a weekend or so, it took me a whole year to tell my dad I dropped out of college the first time, Man was he angry, he was so disapointed, his wife was worse xD, I remember once In a pub before I told them, they were bragging to their friends about how I was doing triple science and maths and how proud they are and how im going to go to uni and go do physics and then how I wanted to get into quantum physics and I sat there hating myself How the fuck was I supposed to tell them what on earth do i say. I didnt tell them because they would be disapointed in me and I was right, I shouldnt of held that from them, my relationship with my dad as always been strenuous, I love the guy, and He loves me but my god He doesnt make an effort xD, He never payed child support, He hardly ever came to visit and he hardly ever got me anything for christmas or my birthday, and obviously that shit doesnt mean anything today, but when I was a child that was a big deal, I mean its not like he was strapped for a cash either, I remember one time him promising me to take me and my sister on a cruise, and how he'd buy us passports and it will be amazing, my mother isnt exactly well off so that idea sounded like a fucking dream, but nah never happened, he went on his fuckin own, and when i was little twice a year he'd go abroad with his wife and her kids and my uncle, cousin and my grandparents  never once did he bring me, my brother or my sister. I still havent been abroad yet, but it didnt even need to be abroad I just wanted to spend time with him xD the most exotic holiday ive been on was blackpool for 3 days with my mum, it was one of the best weekends of my life, she was so strapped for cash, but took me to as many places as she could, even extended it by a day. And he complains that I dont send him christmas cards anymore xD. Admitedly, thats just my petty way to get back at him xD.

but yeah I spent 6 months after i dropped out of college half heartedly looking for a job, knowing I was too scared too afraid of both the social aspect but mostly of failure I knew was going to happen. My family were all so disapointed and for good reason, I was pathetic, stuck in my room leaching of everybody for months but it would always fcuking sting, whenever my brother, mother, her asshole boyfriend or my dad who thinks he knows me, told me to get one, it was always said in a patronising way, well apart from my mum she was more supportive about it. BUT I KNOW WHY OF COURSE THEY WARE DISAPOINTED OF COURSE THEY ARE PATRONISING WHY WOULDNT THEY BE.   
anyway I got a job around August, I was lured in by the promise of managerial training, and big money, but of course it was a fucking scam. If any of you guys know the ol' Direct sales Slave circle Scam, you'll know what I got into. I worked maybe 50 to 60 hours a week and the most i made in a week was £100, I tell people thats why I left. That isnt why I left. I knew I was in a scam, but I was so desperate I just wanted to make it work, I had seen the warnings I had seen the signs but i was SO GOD DAMN DESPERATE FOR SOMETHING IN MY FUCKING LIFE TO WORK OUT, I stuck with it, but naturally my fucked up mind started to  stumble, so ultimately I had to leave. Luckily The scam required me to be TECHNICALLY self-employed so i wasn't ""fired"" per say which might have left a scar on my already pretty fuckin barren CV. I left that scam late September, and since then I've been quarter heartedly job hunting. everytime I get a job interview, I know it wont work out, theres no fucking hope for me,  I almost never went i always crumbled. I always failed, This is the longest period of pure self hatred and pure darkness Ive been in, I have no money, in fact Im in fucking debt, When I got that scam job I THOUGHT I would have steady pay so i fucking stupidly signed up for a phone contract   
So im currently about £180 in debt, so that means no more going to see my friends, One time my friends payed for me to see them, but I dont want to be more of a leach I cant do that again.  
My friend managed to set me up with a job though, I start training tomorrow, Im so terrorfied of stumbling again, because, For the first time before starting something new, Im not 100% sure Ill succeed, I know Ill fail, I know Ill just fuck it up again, and what do i do then? On one side, I dont want my Hope to die, Ive always been a happy go lucky ""OF COURSE I CAN DO IT JEEEEEEZZZZ WHY ARE YOU DOUBTING ME"" kind of guy, When I do things Im either full of real confidence or false confidence, even while doing things that scare me like talking to girls Im full of confidence in my actions, but thats all gone now. In 2015 after my first failure, I shook away the darkness and screamed at the sky that I could do it, that it was just a stumble and Ill stand up and fight through the pain, that in 10 years someone will write a fucking book about me and some student will read through it like ""oh darn what a cool guy, he had a tough youth, cool guy I want to be like that guy"" because they had to. I had to make a difference, I had to, EVEN IF IT WAS FOR ONE GOD DAMN PERSON.  Theres no hope now, I still laugh I still joke, but theres no optimism now, theres no happy go lucky, i just put on a masquerade.   
I'm so scared.",04Feb2019,1

I have been working on this website for months, and I am happy with how it is turning out. I have a section for prescription medications but also discuss alternative treatments for depression like supplements and music therapy. I hope this is helpful. ",04Feb2019,1
180,"For over a year now I’ve been ruining totally myself. I haven’t wanted to do anything or talk to anyone. I’ve shut all of my old friends out and now have none left. I’ve also been shutting out my parents, and going through all this has shown me that they don’t care about me. Everyone at school knows me for never talking and for always ‘Looking like I want to kill myself’. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’ve permanently fucked myself and there’s no coming back from what I’ve done, not just to myself but to my friends. No good friend just cuts themselves off from their friends. What can I even do anymore?",04Feb2019,1
