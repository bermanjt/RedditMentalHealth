0,"I honestly feel like my therapist and school counselor are the only people who accept my feelings as actual feelings, if that makes sense. 

My family says they are supportive, but I always get responses that don’t help. “When I was your age...” and stuff. Sure, but your experience wasn’t the same. I have an OCD diagnosis, and I have a strong suspicion that I also have depression but I can’t say that I have a diagnosis for for that. I hate to be that edgy person who says “You don’t understand me!!” ... yet I just don’t feel like anyone does. 

School matters to me.  I want to go to college. I want to be an entomologist because I think bugs are pretty cool. I care about my life, but mental illness makes it so hard to act like a normal person. Some days, the fact that I have to get up and go to school can not register in my head. I can’t make myself move from my bed.

But nobody asks me what the root of the problem is. My mom just hounds me/takes away my phone or something. “Everyone has to go to work and school.” Is what she always says. And I know that. I also understand the idea of trying to teach me by punishing. I shouldn’t get away with skipping school, but it’s not something within my control. I’m trying really hard. 

The other thing is, a lot of the time my emotions will be blamed on hormones. I won’t lie, I guarantee sometimes when I’m upset it’s definitely just being a hormonal kid. But I wish that wasn’t everybody’s go to. People I meet online don’t usually believe me when I describe mental illness.",25Nov2019,1
1,"Back in May I started taking Lexapro for my anxiety, months later I've turned into a zombie and couldn't tell if I was real.

During the weaning off phase I've starting feeling depressed and frustrated about my job, life, education, new PC issues.

It's been around a month to 2 since I've stopped taking my meds. I'm more anxious than ever before, I feel frustrated, most nights I lay in my bed doing nothing (I cant mentally bring myself to use my PC with its current issues), and I keep imagining different ways to kill myself.

I don't know what to do, I feel like I was better off before taking the stupid lexapro. Am I depressed?",25Nov2019,1
2,"Hi all,  


I've had anxiety for pretty much all of my life (I just got off birth control after 8 years, which I think might have made it worse). 

My anxiety is mostly consistently worried about the future, psyching myself out because of something that \*could\* happen in the future, as well as being too anxious to meet people because I'm anxious that they won't like me.

So I've taken the steps to see a psychiatrist this week and starting on anti-anxiety pills.

I realize that they'll take a couple of weeks for the full-effect, but honestly, I'm not sure what they do?

I know a lot of people take them (the slow-acting ones, the ones that are technically anti depressives). But what do they do? Do they change the brain chemistry so the constant worrying about anything/everything are gone?

I'm also seeing a therapist, so that doesn't have to be suggested",25Nov2019,1
3,"For about 3 months, I have been having a pretty roller coaster time with my mental well being, gender and what my purpose is. I'll break it down.

August: Missing girlfriend, seeing her again soon. Starting to have thoughts about being transgender (MtF) but only an interest, not a thing I specifically want.

Late August: Argument with girlfriend. I talked about my feelings, she took it as me being trans and she had to leave me (she was attached to me and vice versa). I convince her otherwise.

September: Meeting girlfriend again, except she's hanging out more with her friends and less with me.

Late September: Last argument about trans. We break up, I come out to others. Positive-ish support. Then, decide to come out to parents. After a very emotional talk with them, I realise that I was not nearly as trans as I thought.(understandably, it sounds like they are trying to stop me doing this, but I am oversimplifying this for the fact that I don't really remember anything anymore.)  Tells friends and they start to think (at least I think) that I'm doing it for attention. Feedback starts becoming very neutral. 

October: Argument with a friend over something completely unrelated. Friends begin to distance themselves but over the next month I began to come back to them, with some big bumps along the way.

Let me mention, along the way, I was losing my sense of life and becoming irrational, quick to anger, having massive mood swings,  making poor decisions, etc.. all the bad stuff.

Now: I have a massive mood swing. Start a fight with one friend with everyone else watching. Attempt to apologise when I come to senses but I've already hit him twice, spent the next hour in shame and isolation.

I'm distanced from everyone but one person who wasn't there. Nobody believes that I'm losing my mind and actually are making extremely passive aggressive hits at it. 

I don't know if I'm okay to just attempt to ride my life out until I get away from them and chasing passions like music, but should I be attempting to widen my friend circle just so my life in the week isn't a suffer fest of sadness and waiting for the day to end? I have a feeling just writing this that I've answered it, but I guess it must help to get it out. Thanks.",25Nov2019,1
4,"So I have so many issues.... I need help so please give me some advice, this is a last resort.... ive tried therapy ive tried a lot of things. rehab once, inpatient, and lots of different meds.... im only gonna limit this to one subject at a time so... this is a little backstory and just one of the issues I have.

anyway that out of the way, lets start out by saying... something is wrong with me. or rather, I completely am convinced based on my reoccurring behavior and mood and emotions that I am crazy, I'm sure I just don't know what flavor. … I don't really know where to begin... I think the best thing is to just start at my own hypothesis as to where afew of my crippling problems starts. so obviously my childhood. 

I grew up isolated. My grandfather bought a huge piece of land on the east coast to start a dairy farm. He had left a dangerous and abusive upbringing in a very poor state (not saying which) but lets just say its deep south.  anyway he had a wife and two daughters. one of which is my mother. long story short I grew up on one of the three houses built on the isolated property in the deep woods, my mothers, my grandparents and my aunts.  

just some backstory on my situation growing up. anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest thing in my childhood that I feel like stands out to me maybe a huge sense of sexual disfuntion I feel today..

&amp;#x200B;

so … when I was maybe 5 or 6.... me and my mom and dad and sister were all watching a movie in the living room, everything was fine we were all having a nice time and I decided I needed to use the restroom. 

I got up and went to the bathroom that was adjacent to the living room, they basically share a wall, and I did my business. but then..... I had a habit as a child …. of exploring things. of mixing things. so when I was about to wash my hands, I froze.... before I turned the water on.... and I … I thought what kind of things am I going to find underneath the sink to mix together and make a magic potion with? (lmao I loved to mix shampoo and soaps and pretend it was like a love or beauty potion.... ) so …. I dove under there with some curiosity...  and in the back of the cabinet... there happened to be some brown paper bags...

my curiousity peaked... I reached forward and dug around in them only to pull out what felt like a magazine...

yeah... it was a very.... very hardcore magazine... like...….. NOT PLAYBOY, like deep maxim stuff...… 

I felt like a jolt of electricity strike me as I flipped the pages, I felt inherently this was something I was not supposed to be seeing but I coulndt stop looking. seeing back it makes me think this may have begun my addiction to dopamine release. 

and then... I had somewhat of an addiction started for the next two weeks. I felt myself compelled to sneak away and look at this forbidden thing 10 times a day. until...… my mom picked the lock and flew the door open before I could ever explain away why I sat there in my dungaroos splayed out on the floor with that smut book clearly open in my lap. 

she..... she screamed. she screamed and snatched me off the floor.... I was like 6 and I wont ever forget her sorrow and loss in her face and It took me so many years to decern that look. …. yeah so she snatched me up and sat in the living room with me in a chair sat opposite of her not looking at me... the look on her face, her persed lips, her tears still making silent trails on her cheeks. and we sat there and waited for my dad to walk in. her vision was like lasered in on the door unmoving for more than 30 minutes. 

so he comes in and she immideatily starts screaming to the top of her lungs "" you have ruined our daughter!!!!!!! you don't know what innocence you've stolen from her!!!!!!!!!!!"" 

 I cowered into my chair as small as I could be. … They fought violently all night...… the next morning they acted as if nothing happened.

and they always have.... I mean sometimes over the years its been brought up a tiny bit from time to time..... but still... its always presented as a joke... some past awkward parenting moment....

&amp;#x200B;

I have such bad sexual disfunction and I honestly think its because of this. 

I am married, I have three children, but I haven't had sex in like two years.... not really. I mean small things that always feel super forced..... I live under consant and unrelenting sexual pressurization from my husband.... I feel fucking sick everytime I think about having sex. like its wrong.... like im gonna get in trouble somehow.... like I get the feeling im going to be sent to the principle in middle school every time my husband pushes and pushes for sex and I force myself because otherwise he gets abusive. 

&amp;#x200B;

there is so much more to the story... so many more current problems I have... but.... If I get any replys to this at all or advice.... then maybe ill make more posts....all I know is that this is the last place I have to turn to these kind of issues and I really really need the help. for real. help. help me. theres a fucking trunks worth of abuse of all flavors in here. let me know

5,"I'm 28F, and I'm a failure by every sense of the word. I was a cocaine addict until two years ago when I quit cold turkey. It did bad things to my brain, and I really can't find anything positive or enjoyable. I don't ever want to use drugs again, even marijuana, but I always feel the way I did that led me to drugs in the first place.

I sit around for hours just daydreaming about random things. Sometimes I drive around in my car and just do the same. I'm sick of working boring jobs that have no change or challenge to them ever.

I have poor relationships with my family and no friends. I'm pretty sure I'm asexual, and the only reason I'd want marriage is to not be lonely, which is a terrible reason. If I got with a man, I'd just be a leech off him. I have no good qualities to bring to a relationship. Not being a cokehead is the bare minimum of what men are looking for.

I wanted to be a writer as a little girl, but I'm too far behind with that for it to work out. I just want a way out of this other than drugs and suicide.",25Nov2019,1
6,"Title says it all, but here’s the full story:

Last night I had one of the worst panic attacks in my life. It went on for hours, my thoughts moved too fast for me to process, I scratched my wrist, and I genuinely believed (and vocalized) that the only way for this pain to end would be to die. I also said stuff about not feeling that I deserve to live. 

My roommates panicked, prevented me from taking my medication (I had a few drinks a few hours before), and got 6 EMTs involved, who kicked my roommates out of my room, called my parents off my phone just to have them listen to my hysterical sobs, screamed at me for not calming down, accused me of being on hard drugs, blocked me in my own room, and forcibly strapped me in a gurney while I screamed because my panic attack was escalating out of control. They told me I “lost the privilege” of walking because I couldn’t stop crying. My roommates saw all of this. 

(FWIW, the hospital didn’t admit me because they recognized it was a panic attack and just let me calm down and leave with my parents.)

The roommate I’m closest with has been an absolute angel. I hear the others whispering about me in their rooms, about how fucked I was, and now they ignore me in the room (not that I’m actively trying to seek them out). I’m ashamed. I’m so fucking ashamed of myself. I honestly deserve all of this silent treatment for being such an asshole. 

How do I deal with this? Normally I get along really well with my roommates but now I feel like a freak and keep crying randomly every time I think about it. I see my therapist tomorrow but I really need help",25Nov2019,1

13,"Tldr at bottom

preface: she has a long history of substance abuse/mental health issues, but has spent the last 10 years or so in recovery, in and out of rehab and relapses. A lot of this story is broken, or has missing details because she tells it to me in very fractured, wish washy ways. I live in Louisiana and she is currently in California so there is not much I can do. She wont ever tell me her exact location at any time.

Basically she is convinced the government/FBI/police/Secret service, something, has been watching her f/sitting/standing outside of her apartment or the past 3 months, and she finally, suddenly left her job with no notice and drove 4 hours away to Sacramento. She has very little money, no where to stay, and at this moment is driving to the ""hood"" to have someone take the ""tracker"" off her car, and I am seriously concerned for her safety. 

I've asked her why she thinks this, and at first she tells me she has no idea maybe ""they"" just dont want her in town bc shes not ""one of their people"", this is Reno, NV, were talking about.

I asked her when did this all start and she later reveals to me that, 3 months ago, she was hanging out with someone from her recovery groups, and ""accidentally"" ended up in this trailer that is in front of his house that happened to have a a very very very large amount of meth and cash in it. Apparently, someone tried to tell her to take some of it, not as in to steal it, but for what ever reason is currently unknown. She ""says no"" and leaves the trailer. When she gets out front she notices a sketchy car pull up, who she suspects was the government or who ever. Then people who were standing in the yard yell her name and say go out back, so and so has something for you. She began to suspect this was some kind of set up by the government people to get her caught with drugs and send her to jail, which with a history of prior charges would be especially bad. 

After that she said she had noticed the same cars and people either standing out side, or sitting in their cars by her apartment. A month into this she turned up at her relatives house, dirty disheveled, and speaking nonsense, they called the ambulance and she spent 2 days in a psych hospital. She later tells me this was a culmination of the stress of being watched and it finally got to a breaking point where she just lost it.

Its been 2 months since then and she called me a few days ago at 6 am and tells me she moved to Reno. I had no idea of these previous thoughts, or that anything was wrong at all. I ask if she has somewhere to stay, or a job and she says no but ill figure it out I always do. I call in to check on her the next day and I can tell something is wrong as soon as she picks up, her mood is completely different. She realizes it was not very smart to leave her stable job, with no place to stay and begins to tell me the whole story that I have laid out here.

There may be more to the story than she is telling me, I suspect it may have more to do with the large amount of drugs instead of the police, and she just wont say that outright, she could be in actual danger from tweakers and doesnt want to tell me. Right now shes driving around, flipping out saying they are getting closer, and she cant take this much longer. Begging me to tell her what to do and I am at a complete loss. 

Any Advice at All would be appreciated

Tldr: Mom is having a paranoid breakdown half the country away and ; is driving around with no money and no where to stay, thinking her phone and car are tracked, wont talk to me in detail over the phone. Wont go to a mental hospital or call the police bc she thinks they are in on it. And is asking me to tell her what to do to escape all this.",25Nov2019,1
14,"Hi, if you're reading this, I hope you are feeling well. If not, I know you will find it in yourself to feel better. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for about ten years, and I finally went ahead and got help this year. Turns out, the stigma that I had been harboring about medicines was the only thing I needed to get out of my way. I'm currently not depressed or anxious anymore, but I'm working towards a lot of things along with my medications, therapy, self-help habits, and materials and mindfulness, etc. There are always days when I feel skeptical about this, but this needs a relentless pursuit. Only now have I realized the importance of self-care and how it is completely normal for emotions to come and go. I have been very apprehensive about posting here or even talking about my journey or struggles because I have been judged all my life, and I was and still am, scared. But I'm talking about this because I want to help. 

Whoever you are, if you are reading this, this is a sign. A sign that your inner critic is not bigger than you. In fact, your bully is downright illogical and never adheres to reality. This is a sign that you are a wholesome human being and the fact that you have joined a community is a massive indicator of the undying hope in you. 

I'm so so proud of you because you are choosing to fight and live. With the right resources and help, you will fly. And I'm so sure of that because I've been where you are or were before, and although our narratives are different, we must have had at least one shared problem. In that, you are not alone.

So this is a declaration, that there is a light within you, not at the end of the tunnel.

I am looking for peer support as well so that we could write to each other and support each other during our healing process. So if you need a friend to talk to, I'll be here, I might not be on time due to work and school, but trust me, I'll be here. 

You are worthy and I am proud of you, friend.",25Nov2019,1
15,"Sorry if this ends up being really long, I'm just going through a lot right now and I need somewhere to vent about it. I'm a first year university student, and I feel like my whole life is falling apart.

First, I worked ahead a year in high school (graduated a year early) by taking extra courses online and at night, which took a huge toll on my mental health. When I was deciding what university to go to, I narrowed down my options to two programs, and went back and forth between them for two weeks. I'd choose one, tell my parents it was my final decision, and then cry and cry and choose the other program instead. I went back and forth like this until I HAD to make a decision, and I chose to stay at home and commute to a school I didn't want to go to, and knew wouldn't be a good fit. The other option was a program all the way across the country, which would be super expensive and I didn't want my family to have to pay that money (but also, they sort of guilted me into staying at home, which is another story). I did my best to start the year with a positive attitude and an open mind, but I quickly became unhappy, unmotivated, and overwhelmed. My university is literally known for its high rates of depression and suicide, and for having an administration that does nothing about it.

It turns out that the program I chose isn't for me, so I'll be switching into a different program next year. I will be applying for a different program within my university, which I'm not super stoked about but it's a better fit than my current program. I'll also be applying to a program at another university across the country, and am considering two other programs that are also not close to home. Unfortunately, the program I'm hoping to enter into is only offered at a few universities, none of which are close to home. I definitely love spending time with my family, and am grateful for the support they're able to offer me here, but I think it's important for me to pursue a degree in something that makes me relatively happy/excited to learn. My parents are supportive of me switching programs, but not so supportive of the fact that I might end up at a university that is a 4 hour flight (or 2 day drive) away.

On top of this, my family is under a huge amount of stress because one of my parents has an injury that will restrict their ability to function/help out for at least a year, and we're also caring for a VERY ill, very irrational elderly family member. My parents are working so hard and me and my siblings are trying to help out but it's just not enough and we're all feeling like we're at our breaking points.

I've also fallen back into depression. About 3 years ago, I was severely depressed (things got pretty bad). I never told my parents about it, because they were under enough strain and I didn't want to be a burden to them (also, my relationship with them wasn't the best). Eventually, I was able to work through a lot of those feelings, but I never fully recovered, and the stress of the past few years of school didn't help anything. Over the past year, I've found myself becoming very unmotivated and unhappy. I'm a total type A person, I love learning and have always been passionate about learning anything and everything, I always put 110% into my work to make sure it was something I was proud of. Now, I sit down and try to read a few pages of a textbook, or answer a question, and I just CAN'T. It's not that I don't want to, and it's not that I don't try; I want to and I try to buy I just CAN'T do anything. I feel like I can't absorb information, I can't focus, I can't think. I haven't been feeling super sad lately -- and feeling a deep sadness was a huge indicator of my depression the first time around -- so I've been going around thinking ""this isn't depression this time, I must just be stressed and unmotivated"". Well, I've realized that it IS depression, I feel totally lost and alone and not at all okay. I'm stressed out of my mind to the point that my hair is falling out and I have constant tension migraines, and I just don't know what to do.

Every day I'm just going through the motions, I don't feel joy or happiness, I'm just doing things for the sake of getting to the next day until I'm done with this semester, or done with the year, or something. I'm a completely different person than I used to be, and I don't like this person that I have become. I'm not myself anymore.

I've been toying with the idea of taking a year off from school. I would just take next semester off, but a couple of my courses are full-year courses, and I feel like I should finish those (because otherwise I'd lose all the hard work I've done). I'm planning to take a light course load next semester, which I think will be a bit helpful. I'm considering taking the next school year off, to work (I love the outdoors so I'd probably work at an outdoor education centre with a few friends) and try to improve my mental health and coping skills. When I've mentioned this idea to my parents, they're not very supportive. They aren't entirely opposed to taking a year off, but they've repeatedly said that they don't understand how taking a year off will improve my mental health -- they think I'll go back to school feeling unmotivated and overwhelmed because I'll have taken a year off from the rigours of a university course load.

I think that if I end up switching to a program within my current school, I'll definitely take a year off. I hate this university and pretty much everything that it stands for, and how it makes me feel. I think a year off would help me feel sane enough to keep going to this university. But if I were to switch universities altogether, I'm not sure if it makes more sense to take a year off to work so I have a bit more money to afford going out of town for school, or if I should just go and start and see how I feel about it.

I know I should talk to my parents, but they're seriously about to crack with the pressure of everything going on in our lives right now. I'm not sure I want to add to that. There's a free walk-in mental health clinic near my university that I'm planning to go to tomorrow (though it'll probably just be me ranting and crying for an hour), and I'm hoping that the therapists there can help me figure out how to talk to my parents about this. They know that I'm not doing great, but they don't know that I'm depressed. I also just feel like I don't have time for regular therapy until the end of this semester, so I kind of think I should try to wait until January if I can.

Yikes, sorry this is so long. I guess I'll stop now. A sincere thank you to anyone who read this far; I know I'm quite a huge mess right now and I'm glad to have collected my thoughts a little bit.",25Nov2019,1
16,"For clarification, I do suffer with depression, and have ADHD

This is why im making this post, Im about 3 weeks clean off taking MDMA every week for the last lets say 4-5 months and lets just say that I've really only just got out of the phase of, Massive Massive Serotonin Syndrome.

And then I also use ketamine regularly, because it really helps with depression. Not overboard so that shouldn't be a concern

It sort of just subsided a few days ago, but heres the weirdest thing.

Well on to the main point; at this point I know my brain is actively recieving emotions and I know that they are happening, let me give an example

So my dog died the other day, and Instead of breaking down into tears like I did last month when my first dog died, I was very sad, but my body wasn't reacting

Its like something has changed in my brain chemistry and its really strange and hard to describe, like all of my emotions are in check

Now whether this is the serotonin syndrome heavily impacting my brain, or this is the ketamine actually helping my depression (which I believe to be the latter) 

Then wow, i actually feel somewhat normal and like my emotions are all good and im not reacting like I would beforehand

20,"first off I wanna start by saying I suffer from depersonalization and bpd

ok main point. 

title. over the past year or so my social life wet from nonexistent to near thriving back to completely fucked. im a college student and throughout high school I was never ""popular"" but I was a football captain and part of the schools drama club and kinda knew most people and most people knew me. anyways I struggled through highschool even still with depression and anxiety and the previously mentioned disorders onset from middle school bullying and physical trauma. but I guess the fact I had friends and had stuff to do kind of made those things always the second thought and never the most prevelant aspect of my life. but that changed post graduation. all my hobbies were gone and all my ""friends slowly drifted away say for a few. and that made me realize I was alone. now with nothing going on except my college course which subsequently made me more miserable all my thoughts went towards my failing mental health. because my ass got more and more depressed my girlfriend at the time, who id been dating a year and a half broke up with me as I was to much negative energy. eventually I dropped the course and started working part time again and eventually full time waiting till the next fall season to start school again. over those six months I hit rock bottom more than once and kinda fell off the wagon started drinking to fill the time on weekends when I wasn't working. anywho skip to the fall season. I dropped alchohol outside of casual drinking and enrolled back into college. met a few friends and started dating someone new. my life felt like it was getting better. skip till a  month ago when everything fell apart. my girlfriend cheated on me with one of my closest friends since middleschool and dumped me for him meaning I lost to of the closest people to me. than comes the worse stuff. not 3 days later midway through class I open my phone and see a pic of them together and see hpw happy they are and I broke inside. it triggered me and I had a panic attack in class. doing my best to hold it together the friends in my course start asking whats wrong and the one kid I felt close enough to already disclose my issues with I guess was in a bad mood. he just tells them about my issues and starts mocking me for having an episode. I broke into tears I realized I was alone again as they laughed with him. I got up calmly and grabbed my stuff and left halfway through a lecture. after this I left all groupchats and deleted all there numbers to get away. I still go to class but its literally 2 days away from when I hit rock bottom for the first time last year and i realize im back where I was. alone and feeling worthless and tired. I really don't know where to go. I love manga and music and video games but now they don't even bring me joy. just feels like a chore to do those hobbies now and idk where to go from here.

21,i’ve been depressed and so tired and i don’t know how to talk to my parents and every time they talk to me i just get to irritated and my mom looks like she’s about to cry (probably because i got caught with some stuff(drug related) a little while ago and she’s disappointed in everything i do) and i just can’t be with them and my friends are okay but they just don’t really seem to interested in me emotionally and i feel like they’d be okay without me and i’ve been trying to get a therapist for months but it’s not working or something and my psychiatrist is actually shit and makes me feel like an idiot and basically overall i’m just so tired of being alive and all i want to do all the time is eat and get drunk or high. i don’t want to do this and i don’t know how to tell anyone. i don’t trust anyone and i wouldn’t even know where to seriously start. my parents were never ever emotional to me growing up and my close friends haven’t always been super warm and trust worthy. being emotional is so uncomfortable for me and talking about what i’m going through is so hard to do without joking around or something. i’ve tried so hard to show people without words but they aren’t getting it. i’m so unhappy with life i don’t know where to go.,25Nov2019,1
22,"I worry and I overthink a lot. I was expecting to have an important talk with my girlfriend about a fight we had and what I learned from it. It was my idea. I spent the whole day worrying that she doesn't think it's as important as I do and won't want to talk, but I reassured myself ""it's gonna be fine and we WILL talk because she agreed to"".  But all day it seemed like she was stalling and not texting back. Early in the day I even asked her ""Do you even want to talk today?"" and she said yes. But finally it was getting late and I told her that I was worried she was avoiding talking to me. She admitted she was and she doesn't have the stamina to have a lengthy conversation with me. I got really upset when I realized I was right all along and ALL DAY I was practicing healthier thinking habits, that turned out useless. I hope this makes sense. I want feedback please, anything.",25Nov2019,1

27,"Hi, my name is Josh! (He/They) I'm a bit new to this group and to reddit in general, so please forgive me if this post violates any rules or group social norms.

I am a queer and disabled person\* who the last two years have seen thrown across the country three times, and I have finally begun to establish myself in Boston. Because I am unable to work, I am fighting for SSI and currently waiting for the decision of my Appeal Hearing. My most immediate goal is to have sustainable housing, medications, and care for my therapy snake\*\*.

\*Queer in terms of both gender and sexuality; disabled both physically and mentally

My current activities are limited by my disabilities and financial instability, but I am far from being idle. I am a writer and singer with plans to publish my work. I study history and languages, work on my own constructed languages, and spend my time in museums whenever I get the opportunity. 

\*\*Niallán (ball python, pictured in the link below) is legally considered an Emotional Support Animal, as he is vital to my health but not one of the few animals federally accepted as a Service (Therapy) Animal. (ie; not a dog.)

I try to be active within my communities, helping to organize existing events, moderating discussion and resource groups. I have also recently started to stream on Twitch, where I share my love of gaming and singing while discussing mental health, queerness, polyamory and disability.

I plan to return to school once I am financially stable, so that I can pursue a degree in theatre; this focus would include all of the skills I'm aiming to hone, including delegation of tasks, interpersonal communication, and emotional evocation. Presently, I cannot afford the books and fees that would not be covered by the FASFA, especially because I would likely need to remain a part-time student (9 credits or less a semester). My grandfather, bless him, has been continuously growing a college fund that will pay for the direct tuition fees, granting me the ability to return to school if I can get the stability to cover the rest.

I am actively working on goals and objectives for the future while trying to make ends meet as I battle for SSI and proper treatment. My goals for when I am financially stable are as follows: 

\- Go back to university/college and graduate (made possible by my generous and loving grandfather, who can cover the tuition but additional prices, such as textbooks etc).

\- Create/produce educational programs and videos about my mental health, my snake, and how they're related.

\- Fundraise for my community (pay it forward/pay it back).

\- Organize/create community events such as TransCon Boston, Queer Spoon Cabinet, and others.

\- Advocate for consideration, recognition, safety, and fair treatment towards and within my community.

This month especially has brought significantly higher expenses in bills, student loan payments, and lack of usual DTA assistance (which I am in the torturously long process of fixing). In total for November alone, I need to raise $1007 more to stay afloat. This is a daunting, terrifying number, and one I cannot reach on my own. Please, if you have anything to spare, small donations come together and move mountains. Or, in this case, build survival rafts.

41,"Today 17 years ago I was born, 11/24/2002. The last proper party I had was when I was 6, and nobody showed up to that. Ever since then I was celebrated occasionally, my birthday falls on thanksgiving so twice now I’ve been forgotten. Since I was 10 I haven’t been able to be happy because I always get screamed at for the most menial things by my father.

Today was no different than the rest. I woke up this morning and got the normal happy birthdays, and my grandparents gave me 30$, which I thanked them for a lot, I really appreciate being given money. My girlfriend came over (the only reason today wasn’t total shit), and we all went out for dinner. First they picked out their seats before me and tried to shove me with the least wanted. Second when I tried to order, my father questioned the way I was ordering it in front of the waitress, and I had to succumb and just get it how he was telling me. After my girlfriend went home I decided to relax a bit and talk with friends online.

It was one of those JackBot party game packs that you can play on the Xbox. I waited a bit and then decided, “you know, todays been decent enough so far, let’s play with them.” After going to play with them, I entered the game first on accident. Some background, the first player to enter the game gets to say when all of the players have joined, and they can start the game, that’s it. My father freaks out on me that I didn’t let him go in first, and calls me a control freak that needs to feel like I’m in power.  I wanted to leave, but I decided against it. I told him that I didn’t want to be yelled at on my birthday again, and he said I was throwing a hissy fit and threw it in my face. I played 2 games (which weren’t fun anymore) with them.

They had hinted that they were going to get me something that I’d like, but before I went to bed I asked, and they said they had nothing. I didn’t get a gift, money, or even a card. They said my dinner was my present, but they do things like that for my younger siblings on theirs and get them nice gifts. So I was disappointed in that. I went back to talk to my friends online because I was down, and after I had to be off my electronics (9:30 enforced bedtime). I found out that they watched an episode of a show that I liked without me, and wouldn’t watch it again.

Am i wrong in being sad or disappointed by any of this? The past 7 years have been like this, and the past 11 have been disappointing birthdays. I feel like I shouldn’t have been born, I wish that I didn’t have to get up tomorrow. So can someone tell me how to make myself better?

49,"Hey everyone,

I thought I’d come here and ask, seeing as many of you might know or have some ideas. I’m scared to go talk to a doctor, or divulge the full truth to my family. I don’t want to just be medicated and told to go away.

Lately it dawned on me after yet another round of tough times and changes in my life that I’ve been depressed for large segments of my high school/college life. I seem to get depressed very easily, and it’s a deep reclusive depression that takes a long time to fully snap out of. I can think of at least 3 episodes in the last 5 years that resulted in suicidal thoughts for periods that lasted over two weeks. It weakens my confidence beyond belief and I become reclusive, exhausted, judgmental. I find myself contemplating a career in the military (much of my family has served) but it seems to be more from a romanticized death sort of view — like an honorable way to spend my life.

During these periods of deep depression I have no energy and it’s hard to get up at all. It becomes existential depression and I get really moody — up one minute, a few good days etc then contrasted by feeling deeply terrible the next. I feel anxious and out of my own control. On the surface though, I seem pulled together enough. But in reality I’m letting stuff slide, not taking care of myself, eating properly etc. 

Looking at my life like this, it’s come to feel like one giant series of episodes — really happy for a  bit but melancholy sometimes, then thrown off into deep moody depression. Depression contributed to ruining a few relationships too. I get really clingy and I hate it.

Where should I go? Is this enough to be worried about? Chances it’s something bigger, or likely just a minor issue brought on by tough times in life? Thank you :)",25Nov2019,1
50,"I apologize for the length but I’m afraid to omit anything. I’ve been in and out of treatment for depression, adhd, and anxiety (including panic disorder) since I was 12 (I am 28 now). This past year and a half has been both traumatic and stressful for me (someone i loved choosing to abandon me, loss of friends leading to near complete isolation outside of work, trouble at work, and the same depression i have experience from early age). This has caused me to develop an irrelegular sleep pattern (I have the strong need to nap for around 4-5 hours immediately after work, then can’t fall back to sleep until around 2-3 AM)  Additionally, i have moderate-severe GERD which is sometimes unresponsive to medicine (I’ll get to the connection to that and my mental health later). 

A few months ago, I started having panic attacks daily at work. These sometimes resulted in hyperventilation but more often my symptoms were numbness and tingling in toes and fingers, sometimes i could feel what felt like a jolt go down the length of my body, derealization, chest pressure and incomfortability, and would wake up gasping for breath as my body tried to shift into sleep. Occasionally, I had an unstoppable urge to lurch forward or shake my head. This occurred around a time when my acid reflux was in a bad state. I went to a physician first, not thinking these were panic attacks, and he referred me to both a new psychiatrist and new gastroenterologist, due to the acid reflux and the fact that I would have panic attacks after every meal. Additionally, he diagnosed me with oral thrush, and questioned whether i was prone to infection, as my lymph nodes were swollen. I am currently seeing this psychiatrist who has prescribed me adderall XR 30mg daily, lexapro 20mg daily, and 1 mg Xanax as needed. Since seeing my psychiatrist and starting these prescriptions, my panic attacks have lessened in intensity and frequency, however I am still concerned about the involuntary movements. I did not think these were symptoms of a panic attack. 

3 months later and I have had an endoscopy performed revealing a hiatal hernia, I am currently awaiting surgery but my GERD symptoms are much more responsive to the medication at this point in time, I am still struggling with sleep but have turned down the sleep medication due to the number of other medications I am on and the fear of serotonin syndrome, and while my panic attacks have lessened in frequency, recently I have been noticing these involuntary movements are starting to occur more frequently. I’ve noted this occurs when I am sitting or laying down the vast majority of the time and is paired with heightened feelings of anxiety. Some examples of the involuntary movements:

-laying in bed and my head starts to shake very fast from left to right for about a second
-sitting in chair my body lurches forward
-Laying down, i have a hard to resist urge to move my legs and arms
-sitting/laying and lurching with the urge to swallow (which i am unable to do during this time)
-laying down (to sleep) my eyes wince, my shoulder jerks up and down (either side depending on which side i am laying)
-drifting to sleep, my body lurches forward and i am gasping for breath

A very important note which could point to these being panic attack symptoms is that they go away nearly immediately after taking a Xanax. 

Are these symptoms of a panic attack or should I be concerned about something else? My psychiatrist doesn’t seem to be concerned, but she only meets with me for 5 minutes once a month",25Nov2019,1
51,"Okay I'll start from the very beginning. I smoked weed for the 4th or 5th time at a school basketball game in the parking lot, I returned inside with no feeling of being high. After sitting down, it all hit me at once and it was if my vision zoomed out, and my mind started moving a million miles an hour, so in short I was tripping and had a very terrible high. I woke up the next morning and felt fine, a little groggy if anything. I did not smoke weed after that experience. A week later, not having smoked since the night of the basketball game, I was sitting in my physics class, and suddenly I felt that super high terrifying feeling and my perception of reality was all messed up. I went to the school nurse because it was the only thing I could think of and had my mom pick me up, this terrifying feeling which I will label as derealization or depersonalization (dpdr) lasted well into the next week. When I first returned home I laid down and was shaking violently and breathing super quickly, having a panic attack I assume, I had never had a panic attack before this experience despite being medicated for depression and anxiety. Alot of time passed and the effects of dpdr had faded but still were constantly on my mind which fed into several panic attacks. After awhile I decided to try smoking weed again for some stupid reason after feeling this. I got super high once again and felt the terrible effects. My girlfriend drove both of us home, she was high as well, and as we got to my house, as we were driving onto my road, my whole physical world began to loop. We drove past the same sign and towards my road almost 20 times before we finally turned for real, and the same effect happened when turning into my driveway. I know this is happening in my head because only I experience it, but it is terrifying nonetheless, I though I'd be stuck in the loop forever. The same effect happened to me while I was driving a few more times over the next couple weeks, and began to fade as I distracted myself, to the point where I had no more time loops. Now I smoke cigarettes every now and then, like one pack lasts me a month. And after having a very stressful and anxious night, I took a drive and had a cigarette, I then experienced the time loop effect again, I passed the same sign and set of trees about 10 times in this wierd alternate reality that I was trapped in. I pulled over finally after trying for awhile, and then continued the drive home once I was slightly calmer. This most recent loop happened tonight. I can find no other evidence of others experiencing this loop effect online, other than a few cases where people used psychedelics or smoked large amount of weed. I am just desperate for a diagnosis or a cure of some sort so I can move on.",25Nov2019,1

It can help one give up bad habits and stop overindulging. It is a good crystal water bottle to carry when trying to quit smoking drinking or other addictions, it works by clearing the energy field of negative attachments and influences then it creates a shield of spiritual Light around the body.

57,"  

This is me. Here is some background and explanation.

I have always lived with anxiety. It runs in my family and my home life exasperated it. I can tell you that it has affected me in more ways then I care to admit. As a child I would always have nightmares. They would be about falling but then graduated to fighting a foe, but no matter how hard I fought, I never did any damage. They later developed into dreams in which I would be eaten alive or fighting to avoid that outcome. I would be chased by some kind of monster or animal and fight to survive. I did have night terrors as well as walk and talk in my sleep. I still have those dreams to this day though they are much more graphic and violent (I avoid violent movies like the plague because they will manifest themselves). I could never go to sleep. I would stay up for hours in fear of something coming to get me- and not the normal “I’m a kid so I’m afraid of the dark” fear- my brain would tell me that I was going to die. Something was coming to kill me. I could only sleep with a light on so I could be aware of my surroundings. Any sound would cause a jolt of fear that would snap my eyes open. I knew there was no such thing as monsters, but my extreme and irrational fear told me otherwise. I would wake up in the morning exhausted. I was known to sleep in until 1:00 pm whenever possible. I would be told to not stay up late watching T.V. so I don’t get up so late and miss the day- I never told them the true reason for my late nights. I remember frequently waking up early for school crying from being so tired. 

As a child I developed Trichotillomania (a form of anxiety and self-harm that involves pulling out my hair). I didn’t understand what it was at the time and no one really thought to look into it. I remember being relentlessly teased by my siblings about my hair being everywhere on the floor and the embarrassment and shame I felt because of it. I would deny it, but they knew it was me and I knew it was me. I dreaded going to the hair salon because I would always get the same question about my bald spot and short new hairs growing. I always replied with I don’t know. I would get the same look as she cut my hair. 

My first panic attack was at age 13. I developed depression. I will not get into this part of my life because my story would get too long and I revisit these years as little as possible. During this time, I did more to harm myself and I can tell you that I would not be here if it was not for my (now) husband. He saved me. 

By now you can see I have been battling anxiety my whole life. As I have gotten older, I have channeled my anxiety in a somewhat positive way. When I was in college, I would throw myself into my schoolwork to constantly distract my brain. As an adult now knowing more, I have learned what my hair pulling is from and I stop myself when I start- though I must confess I relapse sometimes, and I like to keep my hair up. I have also started to clean if my anxiety has gotten too bad or I have a panic attack and I do this all day on my days off if I don’t leave the house (if my husband is working). Over the years I have battled my anxiety and have managed it pretty well. That being said, it has not gotten better- I have just been managing it better. 

I have to tell you, and this may seem crazy, but my brain truly hates me. I still have such horrible, bloody, graphic nightmares that may last for weeks. My brain was at least 50% of the day in panic mode (that has recently changed). It is constantly telling me that I am in danger. I am going to die. Something is behind you to kill you. I can’t walk at night without my heart racing and every 2 minutes I need to look behind me. It’s almost like clockwork. I try to fight it, but the fear and uneasiness just intensifies. I give in rationalizing that “what’s the harm in looking back”? I can be in my own home during the day and my brain will try to tell me that something is coming to kill me. I cognitively know that there is no such thing as the creature my brain is convinced is real and I know it is all fiction. The feelings of fear and panic aren’t. Vacation hotel stays are difficult.

Needless to say this has greatly affected me long-term. I feel anxiety over anything new- a movie, a new restaurant, a new piece of furniture- anything. I know this is stupid, trust me I know, and I hate it. I also developed a fear of being eaten alive my animals (it is obvious where that came from). Nature walks are not pleasant for me. I force myself to do things. I like roller coasters but the panic attack I endure while waiting in line is hard. I feel so physically sick by the time I get there but proud once I get off. I have a crippling fear of heights, but my husband and I recently climbed Mt. Le Conte (6,593 ft)- I have pictures to prove it! I was terrified the whole 10 mile hike. We are travelers (well, my husband is so I am by default) and my husband helps me in so, so many ways. Yes, my anxiety is always there, but I push it down the best I can. I enjoy the experiences and try my damnedest not let my anxiety keep me from living my life.

By now, you may have gotten the impression that I am managing it okay and I am living my life and it’s a relatively uplifting story (not blowing my own horn lol). Sadly, to say, you are wrong. I have recently lost my battle. It started four months ago. I became very forgetful- not remembering words, activities coming up, not knowing where I put things, forgetting what someone told me not 3 seconds before. This scared me. My brain was so organized and methodical before, my husband and I joke that I am (now was) the “finder” I could find anything he was looking for or lost. Something was very wrong- this was not me. I went to the doctor and the blood test turned back normal (he blamed it on my birth control which I still am a little mad about and disagreed strongly with). So, I did a little research online. Look, I know you should not look up medical advice on the internet. I am not encouraging to self-diagnose and it does not in anyway take the place of a healthcare professional. However, I read a few (credible) studies stating that long term stress can lead to a chemical imbalance which can lead to the frontal cortex (memory being part of it) not working correctly. I was floored and it made A LOT of sense. 

I have managed it my whole life and I thought I was doing well but this possible reality has showed me that I was just kidding myself. I couldn’t do it alone- I never could. I thought I was winning my battle, but I wasn’t. I’ve lost. For the last few weeks my anxiety has completely taken over and the only time I don’t feel sick both mentally and physically is when I am distracted. I am now constantly stimulating and distracting my brain with cleaning, work, YouTube, organizing, music, anything. I have stayed in bed some days with my husband hugging me for hours before I finally force myself up. My nightmares have come back. I have a therapist now and I cried and cried at the thought of it. (I have absolutely nothing against getting mental help, I just felt like it was another sign of my defeat at the time). I am glad I am getting help and I have accepted the fact that I may need to take medicine (I have a psychiatry appointment coming up) to help with my anxiety. I really, really, really don’t want to take medicine for it, but I am tired of feeling this way. I am tired of being tired, sad, emotional. I am tired of my anxiety tainting almost every moment of my life. I am tired of feeling my heart beating out of my chest and a pit in my stomach. I am trying to stay optimistic and tell myself that even though I have lost the battle, I will win this war. 

Although I don’t know my own outcome in the near future, if you are going through the same things, don’t do it alone. Get help because it does help.

59,"I have BPD, and like many people with BPD, it could be the result of childhood trauma. Physical, mental and emotional abuse from mostly my mother. I am now 23 and still struggling to move on, emotionally. 

My biggest struggle, probably the only one I’m stuck on as other matters don’t seem so important anymore, is the fact that I have lived a loveless life from birth to present. I suffer from knowing that love, in all the different forms it could take in a human’s life, is something I’ve never gotten, and I will never get. On top of a loveless childhood, I was blessed with every socialization inaptitudes known to man which impairs my ability to make friends, and no ability to feel sexual or romantic attraction/desire. I’m not religious, but if I were, I’d be convinced that I must have done something wrong to a divinity for them to guarantee that I stay loveless. 

To move on with my life, I think I need to accept that this is the life I got, and it’s okay if I only ever have myself. But in order to start that process, I think I’ll need to let go of my inner child who’s still yearning to be loved, reassured, cradled and cared for.

I haven't been emotionally distressed recently, or at least I don't think anything that's happened these past few weeks has stressed me out other than testing and such. (I'm currently still in school.)

It's not the first time I've dealt with this feeling. In the past before I use to feel this way and I'm trying not to follow the same path I went through back then. 

But I know I do feel as if I'm not good enough. Not good enough as a friend, or a girlfriend, or just as a person in general. I feel as if people can find someone better than me, someone who can lighten up their days better. (Typing that out actually kinda made me hurt a little.)

I don't understand why I feel this way. The people who I'm surrounded by are wonderful, but yet I feel pathetic for being who I am. I understand if this is all very vague.

Things have gotten better for her since then, but recently I've noticed she is increasingly depressed. I just got off a call with her after comforting her for a while, but I know I am not enough. I am not a medical professional, and I am not qualified to help her with this the way I know she needs. She talks to me often about her mother, who has been emotionally abusive her whole life and is prone to bouts of anger during which she shouts and says many hateful things towards my friend. 

I've suggested to her multiple times that she receive therapy, but she always says that her family cannot afford it and that her mother would be furious if she asked. I've suggested that she go to a free mental health group at our local church, but she tells me that she does not have a ride, and her parents would not be happy with having to take her on Wednesday night, as her father does not have off. They do not have insurance, and she has been told that if they ever get it, it will be for her brother who has medical problems of his own. Both of her parents work. 

She has not been going to school for a long time and would kill me if she ever knew I said that. I don't know if it is relevant, but I'm worried this is contributing.

Although she does have a job, she has very little money of her own because she apparently gives her money to her parents to support their expenses and two family members who they took off the street a couple of months ago. She despises both of them, as neither of them is very kind or does anything to help around the house. 

She comes to my house once a week to play D&amp;D, and she goes to our Youth Group on Tuesdays. What can I do to help her, or is there anything I can tell her to do to teach her how to help herself? She will be 18 in December, but cannot drive.",25Nov2019,1

As the title says, im too emotional.  My regular depression aside i find myself slipping into crying fits and panic attacks very regularly at a literal drop of a hat.  I was mostly ignoring it, just putt the issues out of my mind, but its reached a point i literally cant do basic daily activities because i feel guilty over nothing, or thigns beyond my control.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some examples:  Today on twitter i saw a short comic about a black cat being hit by a car.  It clearly wasnt real, but the comic had an old lady who looked after the cat as it was a stray, and death allowed the cat to see her before taking him away.  Then in the next page another black cat was in a shelter bein gignored by everyone, and was about to be put down for being too old and unwanted, and the same old lady from earlier happened to see it and adopted the cat before it was put down.  In the final pages death was showwing the cat that died to the old lady again and the cat recognised the older cat as its mother, and the old lady who took care of him.  And it ended there.

&amp;#x200B;

And i jsut broke down crying, like... out of nowhere.  Yeah it was a very sad story, but had a happy ending, but i couldnt stop myself from breaking down and crying over it.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example, an acquaintance on twitter (friend of a friend sort of situation) is having a hard time finacially and tweeted asking if someone would just buy them a pizza, or send them a few dolalrs for food... And i was able ot stop myself from crying over it, but i couldnt sleep becuase i felt guilty.  Im not extremely finacially stable right now myself, I have like $140 in my checking, and less then $900 in savings, and if ANYTHING happens that will BARELY cover rent for 2 months.  But i felt like shit becuase i couldnt help this person i had never even spoken to.

&amp;#x200B;

In my final example i saw a tweet of someone who had been deported almost in the dead of night, unable to pack their own clothes, and ending up stranded in new york city without their tablet, or clean clothes, and less then $50 in their pocket and again, i broke down crying, over someone i DID NOT KNOW IN ANY WAY.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I feel horrible every time i hear even the tiniest story of someone in trouble or asking for help, and i cant stop myself.  Ive asked friends how they deal with hearing these stories and they just shrug it off and say to ignore them, or not worry about it, but i cant, ive tried,  ijust cant not think about them.

&amp;#x200B;

78,"Tonight something rather scary happened with my girlfriend and I. I could use the advice of someone in neuroscience or mental illness study for advice.

She was sitting next to her bed, I was standing in front of her. Yes, we were clothed. As I bent down to kiss her on the forehead, she began making a haunting noise that sounded like choking and she began to convulse and shake as if it were a seizure. This lasted about 10-15 seconds before she came to, looked into my eyes, and looked away. She asked me ""who's with me?"", ""Am I clothed?"", And ""Did I scream?"" She then told me that when she looked into my eyes they weren't mine, they were someone else's and she felt terrified. 

What could this have been? Was it just a seizure? She said she hadn't had anything like that before. How can I be ready for the next occurrence? Thanks in advance for any advice you may have.",25Nov2019,1

82,"Hi everyone, this post is about my best friend Brian of about 8 years. We are all good friends from home and now go to college, the three boys went to one city and live together and the two girls went to a city two hours away and live together there.

Living with Brian the last three years has really opened our eyes to him. In short, he prefers to isolate himself than socialise in the sitting room, he's extremely anxious and has a lack of self confidence. He is dating one of our friends in the other city about two years, and is extremely possessive and controlling of her. She has said to me that she now realises she is too central to his life and he doesn't have much outside of our friend group, he also thinks she is more attracted to me and gets visibly upset and agitated if we talk in front of him. In three years of living together, he has not once brought over a friend from college, gone to someone else's house or even mentioned someone he's friendly with. His behaviour has bordered antisocial and its very noticeable, the other room mates (4) all asked me and my other friend individually if he was depressed. 

Me and the other friend think he's depressed, but he has given up on helping Brian, and I'm reaching thar point too. I've sat him down and outlined how his habits are worrying and he needs to see someone about it, to which he shuts down the conversation saying he's not depressed. He told his girlfriend I said he should see a counsellor and she told him he should just to keep me quiet, because she said she's too afraid to suggest it herself. His family have sat him down and talked to him about suicide and self harm, and send him to an *energy cleanser* about once a month which is just ridiculous, especially considering his father works in the medical profession. 

I don't know what to do about it. All of us in the friend group agree there's something really wrong with him but I feel like I'm the only one trying to fight it. Usually if I suggest it he gets angry and gives me the cold shoulder for a few days. What can I do to help him? The other roommate has given up and said he's just weird and doesn't even want him as a friend anymore, and suggested I ring his girlfriend, tell her everything that has happened in our city she does not see and *hand the case over* to her. 

Does anyone have any advice? I'd greatly appreciate it.",25Nov2019,1

I am a 21 year old student. Ever since I was 12 years old I have suffered from Anxiety/Ocd. I was kidnapped at the age of 10 and that has made me paranoid since then till this day. For the past 4 years my ocd has been at an all time high with this year being the worst. I have thoughts about how I am a bad person, how one day I will hurt myself and how I will die miserably at a young age because of some disese I have in my body.

Because of mental illnesses this is my 4th year doing a 2 year college program. I swear to god, I cant bring my self to study. I cant focus on my studies, because the stuff that is happening in my life right now are really exhausting. I cant stop thinking about them. I am scared, I am weak I am not making excuses. My parents dont understand, they're your typical asian parents that dont believe in mental illnesses, even my physical illnesses for them are excuses. They wont let me get treated. They think I want sympathy and an excuse for my failures. 

I dont have any friends. I dont have anybody in my life that I can turn to that remotely cares about me being alive or dead. My best friend, my only friend told me Im an attention whore and the things I do are because I am playing the victim card. I wish, I had someone to discuss my problems with, things wouldve been so much better.

I live in a society where leaving your parents doesnt exist. I live in a society where I cant just call authorities and demand that they talk to my parents. I live in a society where talking about mental health means you're bad in some way and that these things dont really exist.

What do I do, I am losing myself. I have failed at life, Im stuck doing my college program while all the people at my age are gonna graduate 2 years from now. I am devestated and I am tired.

85,"So I’ve been suffering on and off with depression and anxiety for around 7 years. Sometimes I can go months without any symptoms etc. However, as brilliant as this is, it just hits harder when it comes back. 
I’m at a very low point atm. Feel like I’ve basically cried for two months. Just feel angry and sad and numb, etc. 
I’ve recently come to the realisation that the only ‘pro’ for living is my family, and the fact that it would destroy them if I ever did decide to ‘end it’. That fact almost destroyed me in itself. It doesn’t seem normal for someone to have only one pro for living. 
I’ve been on different meds, tried CBT and it just doesn’t seem to help. It barely makes it bearable. If anyone has any advice or tips etc, it’s would be greatly appreciated.

I only gave two weeks left in my fall semester, but idk if I can make it. Right now I feel like everything has been an overreaction, but I was sobbing and feeling completely hopeless 30 minutes ago.

Is this cause to go check myself into a psychiatric unit? Or should I try and wait it out for the mood stabilizer I was prescribed to kick in?

91,"Things are really hard at the minute. I feel like I've hit a brick wall.

Rolling out of bed in a morning is impossible. Water on my skin feels like acid. I don't want to get up, I don't want to try. I don't want to do anything anymore.

I got a diagnosis over a year ago, and all I have to do is make one phone call to book an appointment to see the psychiatrist again. But I just don't want to.
Last year they met me twice. Then I was diagnosed. Borderline personality disorder. Dissasociative Identity disorder. Panic disorder and some De-realisation to top it off. I never went back. 

Over the past 2 weeks I have written down everything I can think that they would need to know about me. Atleast 20 pages of symptoms, thought processes, events, delusions, patterns in behaviour, the abuse I went through.

I plan to tell them when we meet that I would like to meet someone for a few months and reconsider my diagnosis. I don't even know if I think it's wrong, my Grandma is schizoaffective and suffers badly, I'm scared they didn't know me well enough to really understand me.

This shows me that somewhere in there I'm willing. I don't know what I'm hiding from and why it feels impossible.
I don't even know why Ive come here to write this. I feel incapable. I've lost all interest in everything.

92,"Hi. I don't know if this is the correct sub to post in. Sorry if it's not. I'm 33/F/married for  16 years. Not sure if that's relevant. I just want to furnish anybody who could offer anything in the way of advice with all of the details about how I am currently living. I'm in the UK, Wales.

I've been suffering from generalized anxiety disorder and agoraphobia. I was diagnosed about 8 years ago. I have attempted suicide a few times. One time was serious enough to hospitalise me for a week. I was so close to achieving my goal.

They gave medication which I haven't been taking properly. I don't even know why. I feel they prescribed with me very strong benzodiazepines. I feel if I were to take these daily, it would add to my problems as I would then become addicted to them. I hear that being addicted to benzodiazepines is an extremely bad position to put yourself in. 

Anyway, recently my mental health has been getting extremely severe and I have been having suicidal thoughts etc. I don't even look after my physical hygiene like I used to and I'm not keeping up with looking after myself regarding household chores and financial obligations etc. 

I am wondering if anybody in the UK can give me some phone line or helpline numbers that I can ring so I can talk to somebody and get some advice from experienced people. I have talked to my doctors in the past, but at the moment I feel like that to go back to my GP,  that's my my last option. The reason for this is because I have agoraphobia and a simple trip to my GPS office alone is extremely anxiety inducing. Also, when they assigned me a psychiatrist, the psychiatrist in question turned out to be my mother's next door neighbour, I had an argument with this psychiatrist many, many years ago. The entire interaction was and she offered no help or advice during our session. You could have cut the tension with a knife between us both doing that appointment. That psychiatrist appointment has made me absolutely terrified of any further counselling or therapy of any sort.

If anyone knows of any good UK helpline phone numbers or resources would you kindly share them with me please?

Any advice of any sort would be greatly appreciated as I am suicidal at the moment and have secluded myself from most people I know-except for my husband and it's not fair on him. He has his own mental health issues and to top it all off he has epilepsy. His epilepsy has created further anxiety within me because I've witnessed his horrific seizures. 

so any advice is greatly appreciated and badly needed. I am feeling desperate.",25Nov2019,1

95,"I disassociate a lot. When socializing, when stressed. I can't think clearly when it happens. I shut down completely.

I get stressed, angry, emotional easily. I worry a lot. My family, particularly my father, brother, and uncle also have poor emotional skills. I was a class clown in school that got good enough grades. I never listened to anyone growing up.

I have a hard time focusing at work. I often have urges to create the unimagined, even if unrealistic. I seek novelty. It's almost like I'm too perceptive or intuitive or obsessive or creative, to an extreme. I know these behaviors are wrong a priori or a posteriori, but I still engage in them. I have a hard time changing.

I get really anxious when holding a serious conversation with a coworker. Which results in the conversation being short, awkward, and negative. It invokes a negative emotional response, fight or flight, where I'm almost crying but not quite. I maintain little eye contact or force it. I can tell the other person is uncomfortable.

Sometimes I feel like an imposter. Sometimes I'm overconfident in my knowledge and abilities. I never show people the vulnerable side. I fear what I don't know. I have the unrealistic urge to learn everything.

I have poor sleep patterns, poor diet. I quit playing soccer which was once my passion. I kind of shut out my friends. While we still talk it's not on the level it once was. And I've developed the attitude that I'm not sure I want to be friends with some of them as we are different. And it may not be good for me to constantly get negative feedback for my actions as I often do. I have trouble with the opposite sex. I'm 24 and I've never had a significant other. I have a high libido.

I isolate myself. I avoid social situations. I spend a lot of time alone, which was not characteristic of me growing up. I introspect a lot now, but I'm not good at it. I get nowhere looking within, I get lost in the weeds, lost in my mind. I think I'm an extrovert and a thinking type. Which makes it even more demoralizing.

The way I behave is uncharacteristic of how I view myself. I consider myself an independent thinker, skeptical, social but antisocial to a degree, witty and clever. I want people to see my point of view. But I'm not confident in myself anymore. I don't voice my thoughts or opinions. I avoid disagreement or confrontation.

When communicating I'm either really anxious, energetic, or assertive/angry/confident. Anxious around most people. Energetic around select friends or coworkers. Assertive/angry/confident when I'm trying to impress people. Whatever given mood I'm in is often to an extreme which can be off-putting. Angry can scare people. Energetic can scare people as well. It's like my emotions are just out of whack.

I have a hard time even developing my thoughts. Where I used to see the big picture I don't anymore. It's foggy now. I'm not even sure how accurate the things I'm saying truly are. I have a hard time understanding even myself. I have trouble answering simple questions, or performing simple tasks. I'm a natural at understanding complex systems conceptually.

I use music, meditation, sometimes exercise to cope but it only helps in the moment. I quickly slip back into the negative state. I listen to music or have the TV on to distract myself quite a lot.

I think I first started experiencing anxiety when I was in 9th or 10th grade. My face would get red and I would do everything to hide it. The anxiety has gotten worse over time. I'm not sure I developed ideally. I grew up in a small town with not a lot of people like me.

I can speak well when I'm not anxious with good rhetoric. But I'm anxious most of the time. I'm not suicidal. I've always been too proud.

I'm not good with small talk or meeting strangers.",25Nov2019,1
96,"Hello guys. I have a friend who is a real drama queen and driving me and my friends crazy with his attitude. For example we all on Skype chatting and having fun and he says out of nowhere that he won’t be playing with us over the weekend because he doesn’t want to speak with us. Normally a person would ask why and why does he feel this but we figured out that this is the reason why he says these things. To summarize he says something and forces you to ask about it. He seeks attention all the time and we try to not go into these games for example a week ago he said that he is in hospital and can’t come to school. Nobody answered this message and about an hour later he admitted that he was joking. Or another example he tells you something which he says is a secret and don’t tell anyone etc etc and then an hour later he messages you “btw you can tell the others”.

97,"I don't know if this is the right place to post, but I'm going to anyway. I very rarely post as I hate talking about my mental health and people making me feel worse, but this needs to be said. Over the last month or two, I've been helping someone out with their mental health and making sure they're ok. They started getting attached to me and I've tried several times to keep it as ""friendship"" based as possible, but there's been several occasions where she's backed me into a corner, and it's been extremely difficult to fight my way out. There's been some serious issues lately where I've gotten into a relationship, and she's threatened to hurt herself/ attempt suicide. She told me late last night that I have two options: leave my girlfriend who I've only just gotten with and get with her or stay with my girlfriend and let her attempt suicide. I tried talking to her carefully, but she wouldn't listen. She eventually went to sleep, but when I woke up this morning, her ""friend"" messaged me saying how the person I've been helping is ""now in hospital and she seems to be in a bad state"", and that whenever she wakes up, she needs something positive to wake up to and so I should be her boyfriend so she's then ok. Her ""friend"" apparently went through the messages she sent and learnt just how ""in love"" she is, and that she's ""trying all she can"" for me. This whole situation is tearing me apart, because I don't know if this ""friend"" is the person I'm helping in disguise or if something's genuinely happened, I just don't know. It makes me feel so guilty though, I feel like a really bad person. I kept telling her that I want to help her all I can, but backing me into a corner and threating to hurt herself or attempt suicide is scaring me and I don't know what to do. She's done this several times before, where she's threatened to hurt or attempt suicide if I don't break up with my current relationship and get with her. I just have no clue on what to do anymore. She keeps saying how I'm her ""last shot at having a boyfriend"", even though she's only 15. I'm 17, and she just keeps obsessing over me. It scares me way too much, and the way she's treating me is manipulative, I know, but I'm trapped, because I don't want her to do anything that could finish her, but at the same time, it's affecting my mental health (just over 8 years), and is forcing me to fight more and more just so I can help her, let alone not really having a chance to talk to my girlfriend due to having no choice but spend all my time helping this girl and making sure she doesn't hurt herself. I'm not sure what to do anymore. Her ""friend"" isn't helping me when they told me that the girl I'm helping is currently in hospital and that the only way she's not gonna do anything else is for me to get with her (which I know if I do, I won't be able to leave the relationship as she'll go all manipulative again to stop me from leaving), and it's breaking me down.

98,"Hello everyone. I've been recently struggling a lot with my mental health, and I was hoping to get some answers, or some support here in this subreddit.

I am currently 19 years old and I study parenting and housekeeping for people with disabilities/children, specifically in terms of psychology. My interests in psychology stem from the very thing I have been struggling with for pretty much my entire life.

At 5 years of age, I was diagnosed with ADHD. My parents really didn't like this, and did everything in their power to not give me any medication, nor any sort of support (for example by bringing me to a clinic), but these things were forced upon them when the children's institute demanded to give me some sort of help. With 7 years of age, I was then put in a mental health clinic with other children, until my mother finally backed down and agreed on giving me medication. From 7 to 14 years of age, I had to stuff down 30mg of Ritalin every morning, and then 10mg more Ritalin every evening into my throat. The medication has always helped me stay calm and collected, but I was never raised properly to actually deal with my diagnosis.

I had always hoped that, like in most cases, I'd grow out of my ADHD or learned to deal with it, but this simply didn't occur to me. I am now 19 years old, with extreme problems regarding attention span, concentration, social skills, and of course, mental health. Because of my ADHD, I am simply not able to perform well on any assignment I am getting - nobody close to me understands ADHD at all, and brushes it off as 'being lazy'. Now I am in danger of losing both my workplace at a kindergarden, aswell as my school in which I am studying.

It's really hard to tell a teacher that I can't perform well because 'of a mental illness'. Nobody buys it.

I was thinking about getting Ritalin pills for a temporary fix again, but it simply doesn't feel right.

What am I supposed to do? This is the lowest point of my life, and I can't figure myself out.

103,"So, I had these ""anxiety"" attacks since I was 7, (after my parents divorced and I blamed myself alot) couldn't sleep and wanting to automatically throw up, having the same thoughts everyday and can't stop thinking about it. 

Now that I am 16, it progressed to years od being constantly sad, crying almost everyday, blaming myself, anxious feeling about everything, trust issues, jealousy. I was raped by my ""best"" friend and her other friend when I was 14. (parents don't know about this and in any case I am not planning to tell them)

Currectly I have understanding boyfriend, I am with him for 2 years almost. He was always optimistic and supportive. But I can see that my issues have hurt him alot, he got more sad and he even told me it's too much for him already. I did things when I was younger that I regret and I keep mentally self-harming myself (on purpose making myself sad and jealous and being passive agressive) even tho I don't want it.

So what I am gonna talk about happened before few time but lately this is common for me and almost everyday thing. I get so anxious and sad and every possible feeling of blame or regret, confusion, not being able to know what to do, reality seems so fake, that all of sudden when I am in middle of my ""break down"" I start biting myself hard into arm or fingers, kicking myself, punching hard in the head or stratching till I strach off bits of my skin or things around me. I cant control it. 

I told my mum about this many times but she has been through stuff too and she keeps repeating herself that she has it harder and that it's all because I am girl and teen or zodiac sign cancer. (I don't believe at all in zodiac signs) And whenever she sees me in this state, she says she will not let me go out with friends becauw she keeps blaming them for how I feel and what I do and I keep telling her it's me. Asked her many times to sign me up for psychologist even psychiatrist but she won't and I can't do anything because I am underraged. Tried called help line but they never helped me.

104,"It’s a debatable topic as to whether or not psychologists actually help. That’s why I’m asking you, strangers of reddit, to give your opinions on the topic as I am desperately in need of a second opinion (third and fourth opinions also being sought). 

To give a bit of insight into why I’m actually considering seeing a doctor, I’ll start with the basics. I’m a nearly 18F, I have been struggling with my mental state since I was nearly 14 and have never talked to anyone, friends or family, about my issues. Ever. But it’s not like I’ve been making any attempt to hide the fact that I am troubled. 

The closest I’ve gotten to explaining the way I am is by using the words of others. “It’s like you have multiple personality disorder.” - this is something my own mum said, albeit as a bit of a joke but nonetheless true. I’m not saying I literally have DID or anything, more like I’m just very... how should I put this? Enigmatic. As is most of humanity, but we all have our quirks, don’t we?

My quirkiness is that I have a tendency to switch moods incredibly quickly and act like an entirely different person. Different thoughts, feelings, attitudes, the whole shebang. Except I’m still one person. 

A good example of my personality being completely whack is that one moment I hate people, deeply and fiercely despising humanity, then the next day I suddenly become rational and believe that acceptance of everyone for who they are is key and that there is some good in humanity. Now this could stem from the fact that I have little to no emotional attachment to the people outside of my family. It’s complicated. There are more examples, but this post would be 7 A4 pages long if I explained them all. 

I get depressed often, but also severely angry. I can get annoyed at myself and others and have a habit of running through imaginary conversations in my head and imaginary scenarios, even if some of them are purely at myself. I do it so often I can’t say it’s a healthy habit. 

The idea of seeing a therapist seems fun, relieving and scary all at the same time. It would be fun to see their reaction of my behaviour and mind, see whether I can surprise or shock them, taking things further and further. I feel if I were diagnosed with something it would be a relief. Just to know whatever the hell it is I’ve been struggling with for so long, because at this point it has driven me crazy more times than I can count. It would be relieving to be able to just be honest and let out all of the thoughts that have been knocking around in my head. But it’s scary to think that by their definition I would be “mentally ill” because what I have is not an illness. I might still be struggling with the things that go on inside my mind, but being troubled is not the same as being ill. I am merely human in a way that does not conform to general beliefs and standards. Also, what if I can’t be helped? I figure this is simply the way I am, what if there is no getting better? What if there is only handling the current situation? Maintaining rationality? What then? Am I suppose to just live this way for my entire life? 

TL;DR 
I have deep seated, annoyingly persistent issues with my mental health. Is it worth going to see a psychologist?

108,"I have very conflicting feelings about mental hospitals. Like when I was inside, even the good wards where there was therapy and when I was treated like a good human being, I couldn't wait to get out because 2-3 hours without anything to do was agony and unbearable. When my phone shut down and I was left alone with my books and my thoughts, I couldn't even sit down and read a book. I have fond memories of it yet I remember when my discharge was extended, I got very bored. I ended up singing to myself and pretending that i was in a recording studio, not for real though.For those which were unbearable, even if I were very suicidal I rather not go in. I was pacing around the whole time like a wild monkey, talking to fellow patients and I was singing to myself again. I couldn't quieten down to focus and read a book. But I realised my thoughts were less jumbled and somehow I wasn't overstimulated by stimuli from the outside world. Regardless, I felt safe inside the good wards, away from the stresses of the outside world.

When I am not working, I think of how I should be a productive member of society, and work, having something meaningful to do. But then sometimes I rather huddle up under the covers, watch youtube videos in my safe space, where I don't have to measure up to my employer's expectations. But the disposable income is nice.

Then when I am with a group of people, sometimes, I want to be alone. Then when I am alone, I want to be with a group of people. I want to huddle up in my blankets and watch youtube videos. It feels so safe.

When I went overseas, I wanted to go back home and vice versa. Idk why. My first trip to Australia, although my mum was panicky and angry all the time I was having the time of my life.(My internet friend was there in Australia and he showed some dodgy behaviour) My second trip, I wasn't feeling it. 

There are times I want to run off to another country to explore the world and have fun. Soak in the cultures and have fun clubbing. Used to love clubbing and going overseas but I feel that these desires have dimmed for me. But the dream of becoming a youtuber/famous person who makes money/tv host is still quite enticing for me. Maybe because I have been changed by religious experiences, idk.",25Nov2019,1
109,"Hi r/mentalhealth 

I didn't know where to turn, so I thought this would be a good place to start. 

In the last 6 months, I have undergone a series of changes all at once. Moved to Florida by myself for my first major job, away from family and loved ones. Moved into my first apartment. Adopted two cats and become a new pet owner. Went through a break up. Overall, I feel like I am having to get my shit together all at once and everything is about ready to come crashing down. I have struggled with immense immense mental health issues all of my life. Diagnosed bipolar, diagnosed BPD, and severe PMDD. Prior to getting this new job and my life flipping upside down, I was relatively stable. Life was running it's course and I was okay, but I was on the path to nowhere. Working as a barista and sleeping on my grandma's couch/floor. Waiting for my long-distance boyfriend to come to his senses and swipe me off my feet to begin ""our""life in California. (spoiler: it would have just been me tagging along in ""his"" life) 

During this time of healing and reflection, I put all my effort into making something of myself. Making something of my life. Perfecting my resume. Perfecting my LinkedIn. Taking care of my health. Putting myself first. 

Through putting myself first, I lost a lot... but I am also in the process of gaining even more in return. 

However. I'm in a deep hole. Where I live in Florida, I have to wait months for a good psychiatrist. I couldn't get a primary care appointment until January either. The walk in mental health clinics are either equivalent to jail or I have to shell out hundreds of dollars that I don't have because they don't take my insurance. 

I'm at a point where I either have to travel hours to get get decent mental help, put myself in more debt, or wait months at the risk of getting even worse. It doesn't help that I'll make one phone call for a doctor, and then when they tell me they're either not accepting new patients, can't get me in until January, or are out of network, I lose all hope and confidence in finding help and end up isolating for another week and failing to make another call. 

I'm missing days of work and under performing, becoming more impulsive, and losing myself more and more as each day passes. 

Reddit, what can I do? Am I not trying hard enough to find a doctor? Am I just throwing myself a pity party? I can use your advice, help, wisdom, guidance... anything. I am tired of being my own worst enemy and simply want to be able to live my life.",25Nov2019,1

113,"Hello all,

I have come to this forum for advice and help. 

Just a brief background about my sister who we believe suffers from mental health. Since she was 14, she has suffered from hallucinations, negative thoughts and ideas. These thoughts and ideas provoke her, making her paranoid about others, super angry and even violent towards us. She always has these ideas where she thinks she knows more than anyone, no one can advise her because she becomes very aggressive towards that person. My parents didn’t think this was her. So they arranged for her to see a private psychiatrist. He was seeing her until the age of 18. He diagnosed her with bipolar schizoaffective disorder during the time and prescribed with medication. 

But after 18 she refused to see him, refused treatment and told my parents that they were wrong. She’s now 30. Everyday we lived on edge. She would be verbally and physically abusive to all members of the family. We didn’t know whom to seek help from. We tried asking the GP, but he said she has to volantarily seek help. We cannot force her. Many times we’ve had to call the police to stop her from hurting family members. But when the police would arrive, she would completely change and accuse us of abuse. 

Later, She found a partner and they got married. They had a beautiful baby girl together. But unfortunately her partner has separated from her as her abusive ways have got out of control and she was abusing him physically. Her house is a mess. She has food in the fridge dating back 2 years. She doesn’t change the baby’s nappy on time and she is often too distracted with confronting someone for not doing as they were told by her. 

Social services got involved because her gynaecologist spotted something wasn’t quite right with her during her pregnancy. We were always trying to find out what’s going on but she would compulsively lie and pretend everything was ok. She wouldn’t even let us in her house. Social services decided after a very long period of time that she was inadequate as a mother due to her possible mental illness. They said if she gets diagnosed and follows a mental health plan then her baby would have still been with her. Baby’s custody has been given to the father who lives separate. There was also a court order made by her partners brother because she physically tried to hit him and his wife on more than one occasion. The father lives with his brother and the brothers wife for the time being. 

On the day her baby was given to the father, my sister went to their home and was screaming and yelling outside the home. We intervened and told her she can be arrested for breaking the court order and begged her to come back home. She refused, swore at us and threatened to be violent towards us. The social workers were informed by the father of the baby and the police arrived to arrest her. We honestly don’t know what to do. When she had previous episodes, we would also call the paramedics. But she would completely change her persona and they would think we are at fault. 

Please help. How can we save her? How can we make her see someone for help.",25Nov2019,1

115,"So I'm absolutely terrified of going to the doctor at the moment to determine whether or not I have bipolar disorder.  Like looking back at things I did a couple of years ago. I have no idea how I hadn't picked it up.  

I'm going to give some examples that I feel are pretty evident that I had it but never picked up on it. 

5 years ago:  in my final year of highschool I ended up spending about a month and a bit investigating the holocaust and was convinced that it never happened and it was a plan by the Jews for some reason.  Shortly after this I went into a depressive state feeling quite guilty about the whole situation and unsure as to re-integrate with my cohort.    Never seeked any help. 

4 years ago: no distinct memory of any hypomanic or depressive state as I was using marijuana, lsd, and MDMA quite regularly  and failed my first year of University. 

3 years ago:  I ended up going on a sexcapade of approximately 15 partners in 3 months, discussing dropping out of my science degree to do fashion design and almost going through with it.  Afterwards if felt an extreme guilt about having so many partners and switching into something I had absolutely no knowledge about. 

2 years ago: I had watched a video about another countries government system and was determined for 3 weeks to change our current government system. Ended up dropping my gpa (our gpa system is a max at 7, and a pass at 4) from a 6.5- a 5.5 as a result of it occuring around exam time.  A couple of months later my ex-gf dumped me and I had my worst depressive episode.  Stopped all drug use. 

1 year ago: I ended up day trading and becoming profitable, I lost most of my gains because I was determined that the new song by Kanye West ""lift yourself"" was highly correlated to the currency pair I was trading at the time. Ended up losing ~$20K and immediately went into a depressive state which got worse when my most recent recent ex-dumped me. 

1 week and a bit ago:  depressive state ended mid shift at work.  Ended up breaching company policy and received a warning doing something that was completely unwarranted.  


Really dunno if any of these would classify as hypo/manic states? 

I dunno if it would be bipolar as I only had one depressive episode where I wasn't able to function and that was the first time I got dumped.  Like is it possible to be bipolar but still have high functioning depression?",25Nov2019,1

119,"Hi everyone

I am after a bit of guidance to any lituriture on, any theorys or even someone's opinion about my own personal exsperiance. 

I have struggled with social anxiety since I have been 18 years old know 23, and have recently started with the help of councilling to manage my anxieties a lot better and am am the best place I have been in years.

The question however that I keep pondering is why my father didn't give me the support I needed when I was  going through a hard time.
My farther is a mental health nurse and has worked in the field for little over 35years.

I have tried to have the conversation with him in the past and felt like the conversation was completely avoided, my trust in his exsperiance of being passive around it led me to believe it was normal way of thinking.

This seems strange that someone who practises  was unable to help there son and I guess  im looking for answers as to why. I wouldn't like to ask my farther as I feel as though that conversation may make him become upset and maybe have feelings of why didn't I help him.

So to avoid this I am after some thoughts as to why this may happen. So far I have found that he may of seen severe mental health therefore a anxiety problem may seen not to severe. I also found on a podcast the theory of unacceptance when it's you own family with issues however, have not been able to find anything further.

121,"When I have a bad day, I sometimes put on sad music and feel a need to simply *emote*. As I don't have a therapist right now, I write stuff out. IDK why I feel like I should share it, but I guess I wonder how other people and if there's anything they do that helps. I'm not sure this helps other than trying to identify whats up with me that day. Wall of text incoming, read at your own boredom.

Today is a bad day. A bad day is when I don't have the confidence and motivation to face the world. It often starts the night before. A sense of dread, for reasons I can't identify. Clearly there's something about going to work that gives me anxiety and takes a toll on my mind. And it always has, I think. I've never been consistent, there's always a time when I can't face doing something, and so what do I do? I don't face it. I put it off. I find little routes of excuses and lies that I can play out to manage the damage. The damage always comes eventually though, if not later than certainly the same day, from myself. The guilt and shame of how I feel and what I allowed myself to do. I punish myself. So why didn't I just get up in the first place? There is this thing where if I am late, I can write off my whole day as I treat it as ruined. I even lied to my partner, but I am thinking of telling him when he gets home. 

I wish I understood why this happened to me. I find it so frustrating not clearing understanding why. There are many things that I feel I have on my ""to-do"" and sometimes they are clear, but often they are fuzzy. The path to goal completeness is fuzzy, and I have little guidance because it's up to me to figure out. I think that weighs as pressure on myself which turns into anxiety. Can I do this thing? I don't know how to do this thing but I convinced myself and others that I did, now what do I do? Then there's the workplace itself, this brand new environment with literally hundreds of people I don't know, some of them kind, and some of them not. It's strange how in this way people don't really notice if you're there or not. Just say you're working from home and that's it. There's no pressure from there, in fact if there was more pressure I'd be more inclined to actually go, and then I'd be fine once I am there. Why am I always needlessly dreading things? It's as if I betray my future self because I get excited about something and zone in on a goal that I want to achieve, only to then have to feel the burden of the responsibility I gave myself later on. I guess I put some kind of high expectation on how I will follow through, and then I tend not to fully follow through and this all seems to add to this pressure cooker of things I put on myself. Lo and behold, when the weekend is up and I didn't spend time cultivating these feelings, I wake up on Monday and want to hide under the covers and wish the world not to notice me, not to need me, and not to judge me. But of course, I am the world, judging myself. I am a master of the art of ""getting away with"" this kind of behavior, taking it to the brim of breaking point. If there's a road where I can ""bunk"" off with little damage, I take it, but not without shame. Because we all acknowledge that this is lazy. Laziness is bad. Not doing work when you are paid to do it is bad. I understand this. But then I put myself into these doubly negative situations, and why? It doesn't help. Maybe the society today holds little meaning to the general survivalists' in us that we just realize this pressure to be seen and judged in the way society accepts, is just a tough burden on some of us. Every once in a while we realise we don't want to be around people who don't know us and don't accept us, because it's so tiring performing the act. I just want to be, and not to think about it so much. But I want to be a nice person to be around so it's important to me to not just ""be me"" without thinking in a large workplace. I must contribute! Nothing much else to say now. Guess I'll get back to trying to turn a bad day into a productive one. Because some positivity is better than none.

2019 has not been kind. I lost my most important person in the world and, ever since then, I had been feeling a silent chaos kicking in. It was unsilenced when more recently I was left alone by the person who made me open up to trust them during these darker months of my life. 

I have been holding on, but right now I'm feeling as I'm getting back to that black hole again, quite similar to the feelings and thoughts from before.


What do you do when that happens? How do you cope with the negative aspects of life when your lifeline has been cut? When it gets you again when you have no strength left? When you have to battle your own mind to make the most intrusive thought stop from running wild?

I believe I have ADHD, however, my social anxiety is stopping me from asking my doctor, I don't want to be made fun of by my family.

The reason I feel as though I have ADHD is my severe attention defecit, and the fact that I can't do anything I do not find stimulationg, or it's at the very leaat extremely challenging. Back when I was 10 - 12 I remember my brain being hyperactice as fuck, and I couldn't keep a straight thought in mind. I was generally extremely hyper-active. I had become depressed and developed a severe brain fog feeling, which I still have. I have also taken several ADHD quizzes online (I know, not entirely reliable), they all say ADHD is very likely 

There was one time where I said I actually want my hyper-active brain back, I think it's still there, just covered by my extreme brain fog.

Social anxiety is preventing me from getting a job or going out, luckily I manned up and got an appointement soon for my anxiety, and hopefully they give me something

I want to ask my doctor about my symptoms, but my family is nosey and I have trouble lying on impulse, so I don't know what to do, please help

I don't want to sound like an idiot who ends up not having anything wrong with me 

Any advice wpuld be appreciated",25Nov2019,1
131,"Im spiraling and im not sure I can stop it.  

I was 50 pounds down last April, working on losing more, I was going slow and steady doing it the healthiest way I knew how to.  I focused on not over indulging, getting plenty of vegetables in first and just trying to keep it clean and lower in calories.  I didn't want for anything in my ""diet"", if I wanted it, I had it, I just accounted for it.  I was so proud of my progress.  I have been morbidly obese most of my life.  I was finally doing something about it.  

I was a long time smoker.  Id quit for a period before, but it didn't stick.  I kept telling myself, ""Ill quit when I get to a normal weight."".  My quit story is a long one that I shouldn't get into now but basically I had gained enough confidence in my dieting lifestyle and was quilted I mean motivated enough by my son and my desire to live a long life that I quit.  It was with the help of Chantix.  Which for me was an absolute miracle drug.  I smoked my last cigarette in April, ive been quit now for nearly 8 months.  

In June, because of how much Chantix improved my mental state I realized how things could be.  When I was getting weaned off Chantix I was not coping well with my anxiety/stress/life...I told my doctor about my state, and she said that my levels of anxiety and symptoms of depression were a bit higher than what she would consider normal.  I got put on Lexapro.  Which has been great.  

Immediately after quitting smoking I had begun gaining weight at an alarming rate.  But everyone told me I would, that everyone who quits smoking gains weight.  That it will taper off.  Just focus on staying quit.  Everyone told me not to worry about losing weight right now.  That after im a legit confident non smoker I can go back to getting the weight off again.  

Well, it began to taper off at about 20 pounds gained, I was yo-yoing a lot though, tickling 30 pounds once in a while.  It was about July when I decided to get back on the lose weight train.  Id been a non smoker for a few months, was having great results with the Lexapro.  My mood was steadier, I was no longer despondent about so many things, the light in my life was brighter.  

But it wasn't working.  I felt like I was doing everything I was before when I was successfully losing.  What was different?  Was I snacking too much?  Was I drinking more booze?  Not enough vegetables?  I wasn't using my calorie tracker and logging as much, but I never did before either.  My style was always intuitive with a calorie tracker used more as a way to audit myself once in a while when I was at a plateau.  

I got discouraged, had a little bit of a Fukitol attitude about tackling weightloss.  I wasn't trying to gain though.  Id tackle the losing a bit later.  So im cruising along in life, taking my nightly pill of Lexapro, continuing to stay quit, im still a non smoker, some heavy life things arise.  I've got a good friend that has been successful where I have failed.  You'd think shed motivate me right, or id at least be very happy for her?  Im ashamed of my feeling about it but Im more irritated by it than anything else.  Her success just reminds me what a failure ive been.  

October, I quit biting my nails.  Weird.  I had been a chronic nail biter/knuckle biter skin around my finger biter, general gnawing on my hands my entire life.  When my nails would start to bleed or sting, id gnaw the skin around them.  When there was no more id gnaw on my knuckles.  My hands are hideous, well were.  Im not sure what was going on in my brain but I suddenly thought id try to quit biting them.  I did.  Id tried that a million times before and I was never successful.  But I implemented the same efforts that failed in the past and this time it worked.  My nails are longer than they have ever been in my life right now.  

Most recently, November...i've begun noticing the effects of my weight gain.  Aches and pains for no other reason than my body crying out from the abuse ive inflicted on it in the form of whatever ive been filling my face hole with.  Im tired, fatigued, my lower back is hurting me, my plantar fasciitis is coming back, im a bit more out of breath.  These are all the things I noted that improved when I lost weight.  This makes me unbelievably sad.    I was once elated at how spry and youthful I felt, my feet didn't hurt anymore, nothing hurt anymore.  It was great motivation to continue losing weight.  Now thats all gone, I mean back, its all returned the things I once so proudly rid myself of.  

This morning I weighed myself...yup, just as I feared.  Im now at a grand total of 45 pounds gained since April 14th.  In the last 7 1/2 months I have gained 45 pounds, but I also quit smoking, &amp; quit biting my fingernails, and began a long term prescription of depression/anxiety  meds.

I dont even know what to think... or feel...im some kinda way and I dont like it.",25Nov2019,1
132,"I'm probably the most depressed I've been in a long time. I utterly hate my life. I want to quit my job but I think to myself that i cant do anything else. Hell I cant even do my current job well. I have no more passion for it. Everything else I look at I dont think I can handle. I'm not good at anything and I just bring down everyone who comes around me. I dont bring anything to the table for the world or society, and I really just want to end it. Yeah it's the easy way out. But atleast it would be something i can succeed at. Not that I would. I cant do that to the one person who can put a genuine smile on my face. But it doesnt stop me from thinking, this would be the one good thing you did for yourself.",25Nov2019,1
133,"Hey everyone, 

I am currently developing a mental health app with a computer science team at my local college. This is in no way a promotional post - this bad boy doesn't exist yet and would be free forever anyway :) Here's the pitch: 

Let's build our mental strength together by turning our lives and health into a strategic game: A day-to-day RPG where we're the hero, and we level up our stats such as confidence, anxiety or depression reduction, and energy. 

Check in daily to complete mini-tasks, track your metrics, build habits, and learn new mental skills for EXP. Launch campaigns such as the 5-day meditation challenge, and collect badges or rewards to celebrate your progress.

There are plenty of mental health apps on the market: most of them focus on very clinical language, with a more calming and relaxing feel. We are building something that is more exciting, adventurous, and even a little addicting.   

Here are some of the names I really enjoy, but aren't quite right (let me know your favorites). It is of course, hard to brand an app with a common word that is likely already taken. We are thinking about creating a new word, a common misspelling of something, or combining words together. 

Helm - Both as a helmet (which has cool mental health connotations) and as being the ""captain of your own ship"". Variations could be Healm, Helmr, or Yelm (Helm in Nordic). 

Forge - A place where you can grow and create amazing strength through challenges. 

Hearth - A place to gather around and feel safe, refresh yourself, and go over the day.

Ara - Stairs in Maori 

Qala - Build in Zulu

Sana - Heal in Latin

Path / Pathr, Vital, Fortify, Upward, Vival...

I am truly hoping for your help, please leave as many options as you would like, especially making new words! I am hoping something just pops out at us. Additionally, if you have any interest in this project and have skills such as programming, graphic design, animation, graphic design, etc, and would like to potentially volunteer some time, please let me know. I am an entrepreneur myself and always strive to pay for work, but right now everyone involved is being fueled by passion only. 

Hope to hear from you soon!",25Nov2019,1
134,"A little bit of background info. I'm a 32 male, married 2 kids ages 2.5 and 7 weeks. I was pressured into having the 2nd kid and I'm having a really tough time coping with her. It's making me resent my wife. I have anger issues. I have for quite some time, I used to punch holes in walls but got tired of patching them, now I resort to abusing myself, not cutting myself or stuff like that, I'm too much of a pussy for that. Usually just smacking or punching myself in the head pretty hard. I can't take other people crying, and my wife is an emotional person who will cry at the drop of a hat, combine that with the 2 kids crying all the time and I'm in a constant state of rage. I won't hit any of them, but I tend to scream and yell at them and it can sometimes be pretty mean stuff. I can't help it, I don't have any other coping mechanism. I've never been to therapy before but I'm really starting to lose myself and I don't know how much more I can take. I hate my job, it just drains me emotionally and physically. I'm on call 24/7 for a week at a time every other week and then when I come home I have to deal with 3 crying people and it's beginning to be too much for me to handle. I don't know where to turn, I'm at my wit's end. I just need help but don't know where to start or even how to bring it up 5o my wife. I don't know if I just need to be medicated or simply just have someone to talk to, so I'm here turning to internet strangers who may have dealt with similar experiences.

138,"Ive been feeling really down for the past 3 years. It got worst last year but with that I also started developing something new that i dont even know if it has a name or not. I feel like i am better than everyone. I am smarter, more talented and i have a better personality. But at the same time I know that everyone else is better than me. They are more talented, loved and accepted. I am nothing compared to them but at the same time i feel superior. I keep calling people dumbasses even though i know i am dumber. With the bullying that started this year, it got worse. Am i a narcissist? Or is it something else. I would really appriciate if someone could help since my parents refuse to take me to a therapist.


A little bg info; i was one of those ""gifted"" kids who knew how to read before elementary school and was better than everyone from my class. But as i got older i became dumber since i never learned how to study. And ended up dissapointing everyone who once had a faith in me.

142,"I'm 23F. To cut a long story short, I got my first job when I was 18 (technically volunteering but they later hired me) in an office that dealt with the public, and left that job when they could no longer afford to keep me when I was 20. I worked full-time and while the office itself was a lovely environment, I struggled massively with the working hours. I'm not sure if it was the anxiety or the depression that it made it so hard to get out of bed and go to work for eight hours every day, but either way, I used to lie in bed and have panic attacks after my alarm went off in the morning, and I had multiple mini 'breakdowns' that resulted in calling a suicide hotline and I tried hard drugs for the first time. I called out of work several times over the course of working there, sometimes faking I was sick, because I felt so panicky about going into work. I always felt terrible about it and would beat myself up for not being able to just suck it up and get on with it like everyone else. It was a messy time, to say the least. 

I was kind of terrified to work again after that and I ended up not having a job for a long time, and was medically written off from working because of the depression. Last August, I finally got a job working part-time in retail. The hours were better but it was an awful place to work. I hated it, my boss was terrible with people, and I had no motivation whatsoever. The panic attacks returned. Thankfully, I was told I was no longer needed there by January this year, and I can't say I was sad about it. 

It's been a really long year of not having a job again -- I was stricter in my job search and told myself I only wanted part-time work. I felt like I was limiting myself too much but it's paid off because now, I've been hired to work in a fantastic office! I won't say exactly what the job entails for privacy but I will be working with members of the public often and a lot of the time, it will be teenagers. It's also your typical office role some of the time too. It's part-time and at the moment, I'll only be working 25 hours over four days a week. It feels quite perfect for me right now. 

It starts a week today and I'm getting nervous. I'll have to get used to early mornings again and try to be okay with the occasional stressful situation at work. The employers are VERY accommodating and even have a quiet room if you need to go and sit for five or ten minutes to feel calm. They know about my mental health history (bar some gory details... I didn't want to tell them about suicide attempts and drug use). 

But I am terrified of letting them down. I want to know if anyone has any tips on keeping calm and keeping motivated to go to work and do well.",25Nov2019,1
143,"(posting again)

I have BPD, and like many people with BPD, it could be the result of childhood trauma. Physical, mental and emotional abuse from mostly my mother. I am now 23 and still struggling to move on, emotionally. 

My biggest struggle, probably the only one I’m stuck on as other matters don’t seem so important anymore, is the fact that I have lived a loveless life from birth to present. I suffer from knowing that love, in all the different forms it could take in a human’s life, is something I’ve never gotten, and I will never get. On top of a loveless childhood, I was blessed with every socialization inaptitudes known to man which impairs my ability to make friends, and no ability to feel sexual or romantic attraction/desire. I’m not religious, but if I were, I’d be convinced that I must have done something wrong to a divinity for them to guarantee that I stay loveless. 

To move on with my life, I think I need to accept that this is the life I got, and it’s okay if I only ever have myself. But in order to start that process, I think I’ll need to let go of my inner child who’s still yearning to be loved, reassured, cradled and cared for.

She has a few friends and works part time, but it only takes her out of her house a couple of days a week and when she is at work she won’t eat.

Hurting yourself isn't the solution: I'm really not doing it to hurt myself, I do it to relieve stress from my day to day life.  
It could be unsafe: I don't cut myself deeply at all, I do it only for the blood so why would I?, I also clean my blade before and after use and of course i clean my cuts.

those pretty much are the only ones I seem to find, I don't really want to go back to cutting but it seems like there is no downfall to it, I could get out of bed and socialize normally with it, now it's very hard to.

To be honest, I don't know what kind of response I am expecting to get, I just want to know what you would've done in my case since I sometimes feel exhausted and happy at the same time. I am a guy (16) by the way.

So: It basically started pretty much a year ago when I told a guy I've known since 3rd Grade that I have a crush on him(lets call him Steve); I was 15 years old. Over time we've become friends because we started to play this one game with another friend of us(let's call him bob). I would've considered bob a school mate back then and he basically was Steve's best friend. Days have passed, we used to hang out more often and whatsoever. One time Bob wasnt able to come hanging out and I asked Steve if I should come anyway. He told me he ""don't know"" so I assumed that I should rather stay home. However, today I wasnt able to come since I am sick (Bob and me are on the same school and Steve is working now). Steve asked Bob if he wanted to come anyway and at that point I got envious and angry. I couldn't even eat anything I prepared because I had to puke. What I was thinking at this particular moment was that Steve and Bob had a greater time without me. I don't know if that's because I may still have feeling for Steve, personally I'd like to go on and not love him but there is some strange feeling inside me whenever I'm around steve, its not a butterflies in the stomach feeling, rather a feel of safety since I can trust him. (I once texted him at like 4 am how bad I was actually feeling about my sexualitiy and social life etc.). I don't know how to feel and to act. I used to vomit every day because I was mentally struggling, it's the first day of a long time I vomitted again. I don't want to be the odd man out (the third wheel). They often ta lk about things I don't know of, such as movies I haven't seen. (Of course I can't expect them to ask me if I know XY so we can talk about XY) One thing was some kind of inside joke of both of them, I felt pretty left out. This whole Situation sounds like me getting into a group of friends and feeling awful when I'm not involved in everything because I have the fear of not being truly wanted but rather tolerated. I am thinking of maybe telling him that I think that way. But I couldn't think of a response if I was in his place, so I don't want to do it because it might be awkward for him but at the same time I want to, just to get clarification. I think I might just be overthinking.",25Nov2019,1

151,"I am 19, in my first year of uni. I have been advised to see a doctor but I dont know I can. I fear I have may have schizotypal personality disorder, I have all of the symptoms listed on the NHS. At first I was advised they were the symptoms of schizophrenia, but on reading more it seems like schizotypal personalitt disorder, as I am willing to accept my auditory hallucinations are a product of my own mind and do not represent external reality.

I have occasional auditory hallucinations, about once every ten days. It is always a female who whispers in the same voice, the whisper is loud, and what is whispered is simple ""fuck off"" ""fuck off and die"" ""you dont belong here"" once: ""you should kill yourself"". The voice will appear when a female is walking past me, the voice seems to come from the directiom of the female, but is closer. I have no intention of killing myself or of listening to voices with no basis in external reality. I have of course thought about killing myself, everyone does and I have not thought about planning it. But I know I wont do it, for the reason that my relatives would be left behind. I guess I am religious in that one way, I care about them even though I would be gone, and even though I am the sole observer of my reality, so how could consequences past my death have any meaning to me. Yet, I do care, this would always stop me. Sometimes I have hope of a better future, but the trend of my life is downhill. I do not have any evidence things will improve.

I am very alone. I want a friend more than anything. I do not know how to get a friend. I can not identify with anyone, I find it hard to be around groups and wont talk to anyone in a group unless told to. This is the greatest problem in my life. I have been alone for 6 years now. You might say I have my family, it is not the same at all. I need a friend. I might think about this differently to most people. I do not care about number of friends just one would do. I do not know how I would explain this to the doctor and I do not know how much of a medical issue it is. No medicine can bring me a friend, I am alone. I know my future will be alone. I have no evidence to suggest otherwise.

I find it impossible to focus for useful lengths of time on work that is not urgent, and even when it is urgent my attention always switches to sonething else periodically. This makes university work consume a lot of my time with little achieved.

I find less and less motivation to do anything. I used to enjoy programming. I do only what I have to for my course. I have lost motivation for playing the guitar, I have played for years and I am still shit. I took up taekwondo recently, I enjoy that more than anything else. Other than that I spend a lot of time browsing Reddit, I do not have motivation to do anything else.

I am afraid of going to the doctor. My best guess of what they will do is ask me some questions, then send me for a psychological evaluation. I guess I will be given counselling and drugs. I am afraid of the side effects of the drugs. I at least have my physical health, I do not want that to be taken from me.",25Nov2019,1

I feel like I’m supposed to do something important, like save the universe or some shit. But maybe I don’t feel like that.

156,"Imma try to make this kinda short. I first met Alicia when I was 17, that was 2 years ago. I played video games a lot, made my own character in one and got really attached to how I thought she would “act” in my head. I’d have imaginary conversations with her and would imagine what she’d say like she was a real person. I kept this up mostly out of my own boredom for maybe 2 months until her responses slowly became autonomous. After she started “thinking” freely on her own she talked everywhere we went. Always commenting on things we observed whenever we went about our day. I lowkey felt like a weirdo but went with it because the company was nice. 

2 months after Alicia started talking she figured out how to control my body. I was kinda stressed from the fact that I was close to failing 3 classes and was having a bit of a breakdown when she “moved” herself to the front of our mind. I felt my thoughts cloud up as I was just a silent observer of what she was doing while in control. We only used it for stressful situations since then. 

Fast forward like a year, I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for 5 months now. I was also writing a massive story and was pretty mentally invested in the main character. One night things got pretty bad with my ex and I was having a huge breakdown until Michael (the character) started talking just out of the blue. He told me everything’s gonna be aight and that he’s there for me. I thought he’d be different from alicia and that my mind was just kinda playing tricks on me. He never left lmao. During the rest of my relationship with my abuser he could “take control” and think of responses to calm him down better than I could. 

Idk who these people are tbh. I know everything about them. They have their own hobbies, likes and dislikes, and personalities. We have a schedule where they can pursue their hobbies on their own and no person feels left out tho it’s kinda hard with my new college schedule. We have this weird mind space where I can see them and imagine them and their faces and bodies are really specific. 

Now that I’ve left my abuser and a lot of stress is gone we all just kinda live our own separate lives. Somehow it just works and we have this perfect scheduled system of what we’re gonna do and we all cooperate. I wouldn’t leave it for anything. I just don’t know who they are. I’ve never had childhood trauma. I don’t disassociate at all, but the closest thing that they could be is alters I feel like. I’ve been to two therapists and they have no clue at all what’s happening lmao. I don’t want to “cure” who they are, I just want to know more about them and how to better explain it to my friends and family.",25Nov2019,1

I can’t scream. I can’t cry myself out. I can’t do anything but feel stupid. I feel nothing but loneliness and it really has me wondering what I should do with myself. I think about killing myself a lot, but I know I won’t do it because I’d kill my parents with me if I did. But I feel like one day it won’t matter to me and the fucked up thing is that I’m already looking forward it.

159,"So, after an entire year of screaming until my throat gets sore, I might’ve actually found a way out of this shithole after trying literally everything else. So my counselor called me and I told asked her about how I could get my disability put into my name and she told me I would have to talk to my doctor about it. So I called up my former counselor’s place where my doctor’s at and got in touch with a nurse. She transferred me on the phone to this other woman who told me that I would need to petition the court to get it put in my name (or somebody else’s) and put me in touch with this other woman who could help me out with that and she told me I’ll be able to get in touch with her when I see my counselor on Dec. 2nd. So that’ll be great. I’ve been trying on and off to get out of here for the last four years, but only started breaking my balls trying everything at my disposal until around March or so of this year. My mother currently has my disability money, and she quit her job just to live off it and hasn’t worked a job since I was first put on disability back in 2015 when I was 17 years old. But since I’m 21 now, I should be able to handle my own finances and even if I can’t get it put into my name, I could at least have it transferred into my grandfather’s bank account because my mom is clearly too fucking greedy and incompetent to handle my fucking money. So it’ll be great until the 2nd comes. I’ve been angry all day everyday since the 6th of March (my birthday) because of a whole list of things, but namely my disability money that my mom has been sitting on her ass living off of. While this help came from counselors, but at the same time, the help really came from me mentioning it because my last counselor was a stupid cunt who didn’t know what she was talking about. 

And just to think that I went through all this just to see this day happen. It got to the point to where I was calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline several times almost everyday for months. It got to the point to where I was committed twice this year: the first time voluntarily, but the second time involuntarily for two weeks because of all my family issues. And just to think that after 8 months of trying I might’ve actually hit something really makes me feel good. This is the first time I’ve gotten any kind of good news this year. I hope next year will be much better than this one was.",25Nov2019,1

163,"Be it friends, (ex)girlfriends, I find it hard to break things off myself and try to find resolutions by communicating with them, even if it's incredibly hard for me to have such vulnerable conversations. I cannot help myself from seeing the best in people. Sometimes, if I can't talk to them face to face, I write to them, which they can read in front of me or away from me, and get back to me on the subject. My goal is to resolve differences, if they exist. Because it's obvious no two people are the same and we may or may not think alike.

However, I rarely get this chance from people who I feel I'm close to. Especially people I've been in a relationship with. Breaking things off with friends who stop communicating still feels easier (but by no means easy) than waking up in the morning, realising the girl I was serious with has broken off things with me without much of an explanation.

It affects my productivity, hurts my self esteem as I wonder if I was asking too much of them even though I notice some red flags in their actions too. I constantly ruminate about how things could be if we could sit and talk and understand where we come from, so we can handle and revise our expectations from each other.

I keep wondering why I seem to have these intense relationships with women, but they don't last long. Everytime, I try my best to not end up where I am, but everytime, I still end up in this place - broken up with, without answers that could help me become a better person.

168,"Hi. My name is Madison and I’m 15 years old. Recently, I’ve gotten to thinking about my life and it hasn’t made me very happy. I need some advice so I’ll start from the beginning. 

Ever since I could remember my mom has been a heavy drink and a smoker. It wasn’t really a problem until I started to get older and learn about alcohol abuse and the damage cigarettes can have on a person’s body. My mom is a sweet woman and the best mom I could ever have. Although, there are two sides to her. There’s mom, my sweet a loving mom. And there is Nadalie, the mean woman that comes out when she drunk late at night. Nadalie is a completely different person from mom. But for the sake of this being easier to read I’ll just refer to my mom as mom. So, my mom is always complaining about how she never sleeps. She been complains about this for years. On top of that she complains about her joints hurting and a multitude of other things. My mom probably gets about 2-3 hours of sleep every night. When she is drinking at night she is really mean too. She’s never hit me but sometimes she calls me names like “lazy-ass” or some other things. She tells me that I never do anything even though I help her out whenever she asks me too. When I try to talk to her about her addiction it always escalates. The last time I tried to I started to cry really bad because I was worried for her and she didn’t even care. She just told me to go to my room even though I was crying my eyes out right in front of her. 

My stepdad isn’t any help either. He and my sister supply my mom with the beer and cigarettes simply because they don’t want her to get mad or argue even though she will regardless. I tried to talk to him about my mom’s addiction and I stared crying again and he just told me to stop wining and to calm down.  I confronted him about being an enabler but he doesn’t think he is. He thinks this is all funny and that he isn’t doing anything wrong. He thinks as long as she has her beer and cigarettes that she will be fine. 

I feel like I’m at a crossroad. On one hand I want to leave my house as fast as I can because I can’t handle being the adult in the house and I can’t handle all of the screaming and fighting and such. It’s way too much. I also think it’s the only way to get my mom to see that she has a problem and that her problem isn’t just affecting herself but everyone else. But on the other hand I’m too young to leave sadly. I don’t have anywhere to go. If something happens that I call authorities or something I don’t want to have to live with my real dad because I don’t speak with my real dad any longer. Also, my step dad told me that if I leave my mom will probably have a mental breakdown because she so attached to me. Like I’m her golden child. I don’t know what to do and this has been break me bit by hit my hole life. I know it’s only going to get worse and there’s nothing I can do about it. I just don’t know what to do to help myself if it gets too bad. 

I guess I’m asking for advice on how to deal with this. How am I supposed to cope with an alcoholic parents and an enabler? Is there any way I can find a place where I don’t have to deal with the fighting and I can work on myself? I don’t know what to do at this point.",25Nov2019,1
169,"I am a fourth year dental student and will graduate in May. Ever since I started dental school, I knew that I wanted to specialize. I worked so hard the last 4 years building my resume for the speciality I wanted to work in. I had near perfect grades, I was President of multiple student organizations, I published research, I did hundreds of hours of volunteer work, I spent thousands of dollars on continuing education courses. I had so many sleepless nights the last four years trying to keep up with everything. I lost many of my good friends and my boyfriend because I couldn't make time for them. The Dean of my school went through my resume with me and told me it was one of the most impressive he has ever seen. And yet here I am, spending another holiday alone without anything to show for it. 

Everyone said I was going to get in. I applied to 13 schools, I got 1 interview, and 0 acceptances. My school had about 15 people apply to residencies and everyone else has gotten in. Most people had 8-9 interviews. I had 1. I've tried to rationalize it every way I can. All the way down to lying to myself and saying ""all of them were guys and I'm a woman and there is still a lot of sexism in dentistry"". 

It doesn't matter though. I wasted four years of my life for absolutely nothing. My family is telling me to suck it up, I'm going to be a dentist in May, so I should be thankful. They tell me to work for a few years and reapply. My friends from back home are all celebrating engagements, wedding anniversaries, their children's birthdays. I gave up all of that, moved across the country with my cat, and didn't even achieve what I set out to do. I put everything about my life on hold for nothing. I'm so far behind on applying for jobs for after graduation that I'm going to be stuck working for some bad corporate office where an office manager without a dental degree makes all of the decisions for me.  

All I can do is cry. The realization of me not getting into a program finally set in about 2 weeks ago. As more and more of the people from my program are sharing their grand plans for graduation, the more it hurts to see. ""My four years of hard work has finally paid off!"" What about my four years of hard work? 

A few years ago, I was diagnosed with MDD and GAD. I can't even see a therapist or anyone now to talk about all of this. I'm in clinic M-F, 7:15am-5:30pm with a 45 minute lunch break if I'm lucky. All I do is go to clinic, come home, and go to sleep. I've gained 25lbs. I constantly feel like garbage. My anxiety is starting manifest in physical ways and it's all for nothing. I can't sleep at night, so my doctor put me on prescription sleeping pills, but then I'm too tired in the morning, so I have to use more medications to wake me up.  I have no idea what to do with my life and I can't bring myself out of this self-pity bubble. I'm tired of people telling me I should be thankful for what I have achieved. I'm tired of people telling me they are shocked I didn't get in. I'm tired of everything.",25Nov2019,1
170,"Hello. I want to share my thoughts and feelings with you. I am contemplating on suicide for a while, I am 24 years old; I did not turn into the person that I was hoping to become. I have no ""real"" connection with friends nor my parents. I feel like there is no more need to flutter. To be honest it has been long time when I started to feel depressed, given up on everything; every aspritation and every motivation that I had. I believe It was like when I was around age 12 or 13. Since then I am going with the flow anyways. At this point in my life; I am facing everything is harder right now, and the flow that I have surrendered myself lead me to a point where I have no real friends, no connections that I would have wanted, nor the hobbies I would like. From this point It would be so hard to make things as the way ""I want"", because of the psycological baggeage, emotional beggage and many missed chances of earlier ages. I feel like a dissappointment. Not to my parents or society or my friends. But I feel like I have let down myself and age 24 I believe is not the optimal, nor satisfactory age to face this after 12 years of autopilot. So I am really giving up. My only thought is what would my cat do, If I would die. I am already living alone with no visitors, my parents even though they would be sad I believe uncounsciously they saw it coming, they would understand. Beside that there is no one to feel sad dearly anyway. 

I couple of times diagnosed with different disorders from different doctors : like depression, social anxiety, borderline, ocd etc. At this point I am aware of many things about myself that can be diagnosed as this and that; yet the point is ultimately; I am not living the life that I want; as I deserved because I did literally nothing like last 12 years in the direction of my aspirations, my dreams. I didn't set a goal. Now I am in a point where I want to change things but It is so hard with all the baggeage and many of the chances are perished since I came to 24 with doing literally nothing.

171,"Hi all, this weekend I was first on scene to a fatal car accident. Me and some friends tried to revive the casualty with cpr but he was long past gone.

174,"Hello!

I started seeing a therapist (psychologist) a month ago. I have been diagnosed with BPD, with a strong possibility of Bipolar. I initially started to see her because I believe I have DID.  While DID hasn't officially been diagnosed yet, it's still on the table as we suss out the situation. I also have been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder with Anxiety and, separately, Post-Partum Depression. Season Affective Disorder is a big part of my life. I have a history of alcohol abuse. In short, I have a lot of co-morbidities, and what my therapist calls a ""complex mental illness"".  I have significant childhood trauma and attachment issues, as you would expect.

Understanding the nature of my mental illness really does explain a lot, and I've felt like I've had breakthrough after breakthrough in understanding my psychology and why my mind operates the way that it does. Despite the intimidating list of diagnoses (some of which have certain a stigma attached to them), I'm feeling hopeful and optimistic. I've been in a good mental-space for the past 8 months or so and am actually happy, so I went into therapy with a positive frame of mind. 

I've been going to therapy once a week. We spent the first 3 weeks of therapy going over my history, and then at the end of the fourth appointment she presented her diagnoses and stated that she wanted to work on treating the symptoms - helping me to regulate my emotions and working organizing my life - instead of labeling me. This is great, because it is exactly what I want. 

However. During the past two sessions since then, she's just wanted me to talk. She listens and provides insight when appropriate, but it's mostly just me talking. I have *a lot* to talk about, especially given that I've been having breakthrough after breakthrough, with great deal of insight that I didn't have before. But yeah, it's mostly just me talking, telling her about my insights and breakthroughs.

Is this normal?  What should I expect from my therapist? Where should I suggest we go from here?",25Nov2019,1

176,"I am currently going to therapy and it has helped a lot. I'm doing Cognitive Behavior Therapy and I've learned some good coping mechanism for anxiety and establishing boundaries. But I have mixed feelings about my therapist.

I want to preface this with the fact the she is highly competent and knows her shit. But I hate going to see her. I know the nature of CBT is that it's uncomfortable and I'm not weirded out by my therapist or anything. I just dislike her. She had me hospitalized my very first visit (I had suicidal ideation) and later, when I expressed concerns about it potentially causing me to lose my job, she brushed me off and said to stop viewing it in such a negative light. She also said ""even though I could have had you committed, you went in voluntarily which speaks to you commitment to recovery."" Uh sure but I still had a police escort and she was pretty awful about the experience. (I get she was frightened because the patient before me literally tried to stab herself with a pencil before I got there but still this wasn't a bright spot in my history either.) 

 She also doesn't seem to think my progress is ""enough"". Like I'll say something like I made an effort to be social, which is something I struggle with, and she says that I could do more. She says I have become complacent in my career and I should do more, be more, completely move away to further my goals. The thing is I teach Junior College and the next step up is administration which I don't want to be. I've never wanted to be admin because I know I would hate it. 

Tl;dr My therapist constantly moves the bar, disregarding progress I have made by saying I should do more. She is competent but I hate going to see her. Should I get a new therapist or keep the one I have? And/or how do I suck it up and get over the fact I dislike her?",25Nov2019,1
177,"**I am not suicidal and I make no active attempt to harm or kill myself.**

I   live a very good lifestyle. I am very healthy, I exercise almost  daily,  I am vegan, I limit my sugar intake, I spend a lot of time  outdoors and  in nature, I drink plenty of water, I visit the doctor as  necessary, I  help out people whenever possible, I try to live as  ethically as  possible, I have great and healthy hobbies, I live in a  great area with  awesome people, I regularly volunteer and help with  charities, I clean  up public and natural spaces whenever possible, I  have a loving and  caring family, I spend a lot of time with my pets and  do fun things with  them, I am very friendly around people, I have  great friends and  regularly spend time with them, I do well in school, I  am smart, I  travel quite often, I visit local businesses and farmer's  markets, and I  am a part of a few great clubs at school (including the  swim team on  which I am pretty good).

However, If I died tomorrow I wouldn't care at all (not that I'd have much choice). I **DO NOT**   make any active effort at killing or harming myself, and I try to look   after my mental health as much as possible. But I don't really care   about myself much. I don't share much with people because I figure that   they wouldn't care much about it, because I know that they wouldn't  care  much about what I'm talking about because everyone seems so self   absorbed. I also hate boasting, or talking about myself, and I much   prefer to listen to other people and what they have to say as it seems   far more interesting than what I have to say. However, I have been told   that I am very funny and I find it easy to make people laugh. I also   have a very relaxed sense of humor and I find lots of things funny   (light, heavy, dark, PC, slap-stick, etc. humor of all kinds) and I love   to laugh.

But  like I said, I  don't care if I live or die. I'm not scared of death  either, I feel  like it's a silly thing to be scared of. While driving, I  often think  about what would happen if I drove into oncoming traffic or  something  like a barrier or wall. Tasks require a lot of motivation to  complete,  but I can find the motivation and I get stuff done, but I am  constantly  getting distracted by other things. I feel like I don't ever  fully  connect to people and that they all find me weird. I never want to  be a  bother or burden to someone else or interrupt what they're doing  or  future plans, so I don't like to text or talk to people over the   internet much. I also distrust the internet and what I do on it (but   that's unrelated and more a paranoid socialist type thing).

I   have a tendency to say really dumb, or do really dumb things that I   think ends up hurting and distancing people, but I never try to, and I   hate making people feel bad and distancing them. I hate developing   romantic relationships with people as I don't want to be attached to one   person and tend to have more friends with benefits type relationships   and platonic relationships, as well as regular friends. I feel as  though  I never develop true connections with people and I also tend to  hurt  and break relationships really easily without meaning too. I tend  to go  in waves as to how often I talk to or interact with someone,  which sends  mixed messages and makes for weak connections but I seem to  do it  regardless of how hard I try not to.

I   also have a hard time reading my own feelings and regularly feel kind   of empty instead, so I force myself to do other things and ignore those   feelings. I struggle to determine if I'm feeling happy, or anxious, or   mad, or sad, or excited, or romantic, or comedic, or lazy, or full of   energy, etc. so I usually just show or act how people would expect me  to  act, because I don't feel much (good or bad) so I figure that I  should  show something. I spend a lot of time with other people, and  they seem  to have fun with me, but I always feel that they're hanging  out with me  out of obligation or pity and that they have a million  different things  that they'd rather do. Most of my friends don't share  the same interests  as me, and the people who do are people that I find  really weird, which  makes me nervous that that is how I'm viewed by my  friends even though I  know that I am very different to them.

I   have lots of hobbies that I do, that I enjoy (I think), like candle   making, cooking, baking, running, swimming, cycling, programming, doing   techie stuff, gaming (video games and board games), eating new things,   exploring places, brewing kombucha, hiking, and driving. I do a lot of   those to relax and try to focus on ones that make me healthier and   happier.

The world also seems like  it's becoming such as terrible, dystopian  place, and I really want to  be able to make it better and help other  people in less fortunate  situations than me (such as becoming a doctor,  working for a charity,  or becoming a politician that actually works for  people, not  corporations), but at the same time I feel like I would be  less of a  burden on everyone and the world if I died and didn't have to  consume  anything else or have the potential of hurting more people and  the  planet.

I  don't know if any of  that stuff is related, but like I said before, I  don't care if I live  or die. Either one seems just as great to me.

179,"So it turns out my friend and I both experience sexual and romantic intrusive thoughts and develop pseudo-crushes based off of the desire to protect or ""fix"" someone. And we've both developed these pseudo-crushes on each other. 

For context, we have been buddies for about a year now and share a mutual bond based off having been used and abused in prior friendships. I'm not sure about how it is on their end, but I know on my end I find it much easier to be vulnerable with them. This is the first friendship I've had where we will both try to support each other emotionally and encourage each other to grow as people. They let me know their boundaries and we have open communication about our mental health. 

Now, the pseudo-crushes. Both of us experience intrusive thoughts that can cause us to become obsessed with a person. For me, I know that this means I will go through all the phases of a crush without actually being attracted to a person, or even experiencing it in regards to people I am repulsed at the thought of having a relationship with. It can also mean sexual thoughts about people or things that it is not at all appropriate to have these thoughts about. For both of us, it can turn into a kind of ""savior complex"" where we feel we must unconditionally love a person in order to ""save"" them. This can develop on any person, regardless of our sexual orientation. 

I went off on a rant the other day in which they helped calm me down before ending the conversation as it was becoming too stressful. I guess the mood to be vulnerable hit them too, as they decided to share about the trauma at the root of their mental health issues. Then they told me about their pseudo-crushes. And that they had one on me. It stems from a dream they had a couple months ago that involved us confessing our love for each other. They are fully aware that they are not actually attracted to me, but still suffer from intrusive thoughts about us being in a relationship and hoped that by sharing this fact that the thoughts might finally go away. 

I haven't shared this with them, but I had also experienced these thoughts about them. Fortunately, after starting a medication to help with my anxiety my repetitive thoughts mostly are under control. But I am still afraid that I might be secretly attracted to them and thus want them to be attracted to me. Part of this is because they have been so caring towards me, something I rarely get in friendships and consequently tend to latch onto. I also don't want to tell them this as it might make things worse.  I am now also afraid that I am taking advantage of them by being open about my mental health, as this might be causing them to feel they have to help me and fueling their thoughts. While I also experience intrusive thoughts, I never received outside help to deal with them. I have no idea how to help someone else who is dealing with an issue similar to mine. I don't want to accidentally hurt this person but I want to help. I'm just not sure how to.

tl;dr friend will develop intrusive thoughts about being attracted to a person. This time that person is me. I want to help, or at least not make it worse, but am not sure how to. Ideas?",25Nov2019,1

I have talked to someone in the past but I did downplay my symptoms, and I also felt like the doctor didn’t take me seriously. That’s how I feel all the time, that no one will take me seriously or they will just judge me when I explain how my mind really works. “But you’re a pretty girl” is what I remember the last doctor saying, as if that meant anything. Are pretty people not allowed to have problems??
I am so miserable. It has effectively ruined my relationship and I know is the reason my boyfriend of 8 years will not marry me. He told me today that he just wants me to take care of myself, thinks I’m an idiot and has no idea why I think I could ever be a parent (being a mom is my dream.) He said I’m making his life miserable because I don’t know how to be an adult. I told him I think about driving my car off the side of the highway into a ditch almost every time I’m in it. NOTHING MATTERS. Before this, I was standing there threatening to kill myself. I’m sure he thought I was being manipulative, but I really want to die. I feel like I have nothing to live for. I’m 26 and have no accomplishments, I’m in school but I hate it. I hate my job too. I have no friends. My head is filled with negative thoughts ALL of the time. I’ll have a good week or two where I feel on top of the world and I start making appointments, doing things I’ve been putting off forever, etc. The next week I’m back to feeling like I can’t do anything, canceling plans, skipping class. It makes me sound so pathetic but my boyfriend and our pets are all that I feel I have to life for. If I wasn’t worried about making someone else depressed, I don’t think I would be here now. 
I feel like a crazy person who is only getting worse every day, and I don’t know how much longer I can live like this.

183,"I'm a 22 (F) So, a little bit of background I grew up with a father who was an alcoholic who sexually abused my sister and while I wasn't directly victim or witness or even aware at the time, I always had this unshakeable fear that he was going to attack me and so I spent many a nights paralyzed with fear staring at my bedroom door ready to attack. Since, I got to college I started struggling with anxiety, depression, and being  jumpy/ startled easily. I currently am graduated and seeing a therapist. Although I've tested positive for for bipolar II, and PTSD on all the self check tests I'm not actually diagnosed with anything formally or taking any medication. Anyway for a while I've been doing amazing, I stopped drinking a lot and have been getting more regular sleep, and all my symptoms have gone away and I've been less likely to be triggered by past triggers. 

So last night I was leaving an AMA party and I got a huge since of dread and fear. Which is weird cause I had stopped being afraid of walking alone and men etc. Anyway I avoided the alley I usually take and got in my car to leave. I was parallel parked and so as I pulled out my car was perpendicular with the road. A red sports car came speeding around the corner at 80 mph and was on course to T-bone me driver side (most likely would have killed me) I screamed and they slowed enough and I managed to accelerate out of the way but we were a few feet from collision. Usually this sort of thing wouldn't bother me but I think the aspect of actual assured almost death really set me off. I almost started crying ( I never cry) and I took several hours to calm down before I could fall asleep.

This morning I was opening at work at Stbx and and a mobile order came in for Kerry (which is my dad's name and spelling) this is a regular customer we have but it always shakes me a bit. I know it's not my dad because he lives across the country and doesn't know where I live or work, but at the same time I got the order the door opened and an older man walked in looked right at me and smiled and I thought it was my dad or someone he sent or something and I freaked out and started having trouble breathing and after helping him, I  took quite a while to internally calm down. Since, I've had anxiety and super hight heart rate all day and I'm jumpy and can't seem to calm down. 

I just wanted to know is this symptomatic of ptsd or is it normal to get triggered like that by an incident completely unrelated to my trauma and revert back to old anxiety patterns so quickly. If anyone has any experience with this kind of thing is it generally temporary or will I have to put excessive work into myself again to get back to where I was?

184,"Everyday I see all of these people who have it way worse than me in terms of mental health.  
I'm receiving significantly more help than them, even though my issues are way smaller.

Yet everyone treats me like I'm ill, and honestly, I'm scared I accidentally made my situation seem worse than it actually is.

I just had such an odd but refreshingly beautiful *truly* human experience. 

I was leaving a particularly difficult therapy session where I cried most of the way through. As I was leaving my therapists office I booked it to the elevator because my puffy red eyes and the potential that I was going to burst into tears and shatter into pieces was happening and I wanted to get out of there as soon as I could so if I broke down it wouldn’t be in the lobby and I could just get outside. 

I clicked the button to go from the 5th floor to the lobby while I stood alone in the elevator. Then the elevator stopped one floor below me- a different floor of the therapy center I was at. 

A young 20 something female presenting human came into the elevator and stood slightly in front of me. I heard sniffling and realized she was silently, bravely trying to contain her crying. Their faux fur coat hood obstructed my view of their face but I could hear the restraint. As we stood there descending in the elevator I just thought to myself very mindfully “here are two people who are hurting in the same space, each going through something different but feeling pain and yet we stay silent.” 

For a moment I had the urge to reach out and hug her. I felt the same way as I walked half a block down the road behind her, with her cries still being stifled the whole time but audibly getting a bit louder. 

I chose not to touch her because some people have trauma and would be startled if you touch them so I didn’t. But that’s the only reason I didn’t do anything. To respect that she might be startled by my intentioned loving and empathetic touch. 

But to have two humans together in a box descend 3 floors and not acknowledge each other was powerful. I don’t know if she noticed me, if she knew it was okay to cry in front of me because internally I was still crying. 

The silence of two peoples hurt was ear shattering. Painful. Sad. But the most visceral human experience I’ve ever had. 

My eyes are open, I saw another persons humanity and we were linked in one way or another. We stood in silent solidarity. Resilient, we stood in tandem in our hurt. 

I hope they are okay. I hope they have someone that can hug them in the way that they need. In the way I need right now. But instead I sit here on my hour ride home on the train now filled with a curiosity, heaviness, sadness and yet peace. I hope they know they were seen and not feel invisible.",25Nov2019,1

188,"So as the title claims, I realized today that I have dug myself into a burnout hole in every way and I don't even know what I need anymore. Part of that is professional drive (attorneys aren't known as happy people) but part of that has been a long long long time is not having my needs respected. My dad never really respected my needs, even though he tried his best. Then I had a boyfriend who spent 10 years not respecting my very basic needs (and putting his penis where it didn't belong repeatedly) and then I met my husband, who for a long time was not the most supportive partner (he has since figured that out). 

Now my husband and my therapist ask ""what feeds your soul?"" And I have no idea. And my husband wants to give me what I want, but when he asks what movie we should see I always pick the one I know he will want and consider myself happy to be doing something with him. I can't think of my needs and wants. When someone asks me what I want for dinner I genuinely don't know. When they ask me what I need to rejuvenate I just don't know. I feel so hopeless.

I've done it since o was a kid. A feeling of hopelessness and self hatred leads to outbursts of self rage and self inflicted harm.

I don't know what to think anymore, I'm almost certain they don't like me anymore. I've been nothing but an annoying burden this whole semester and then some. 

I've screamed at friends, ignored their advice and just want to wallow myself in pity and finally regret. 

I don't want people to like me anymore. I want them to hate me. i want to feel miserable and awful and become the worst human being to live. I want people to look at me and say what an awful freak that is. What kind of r****d does this? What kind of fuck cries about test and grades besides privileged assholes who don't get A's (even though I'm a mediocre student at best).what kind of idiot screams at not being able to accomplish things that are rated or scored or leave other people's opinions on me. Fucked up a simple conversation well congraduations today we're whipping ourselves with a belt alone in your room until your roommate comes back and you need to pretend you were taking a nap otherwise they'll hate you even more than I know they already do. 

Today I had a debate assignment and knew I fucked up and ruin not only my grade but my teammates so what did I do? I went outside the class while the next team were debating and bashed my head into a bathroom wall until the scab on my forehead opened and I had a bump the side of an actual egg. 

I want to get beaten up, I want to feel pain I don't want to feel good anymore I want to be alone and have everyone know what kind of freakish monster I am. I don't want sympathy or pity anymore. I don't want help. What I want is to die, alone, unconnected, and numb. Reminders of a better life only make the right choice harder. 

Therapy will just make me a competent loser

Tutoring will make me a smart but unstable freak

Taking a break will make me a depressed potato.

I want to feel horrible as it's the only thing that gets me up in the morning. ""How ars we fuckinh up today? Who will hate you now?

192,"About me:  
Male 21 from the Netherlands 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately five not been feeling too great mentally.

I'm not exactly certain what causes it, however below I describe a few things that might contribute.

**Health:**

For about a year now I’ve been dealing with some (minor) health issues. These are generally things like stomach-ache and nausea. Usually in the morning I have a nauseous feeling, which sometimes lasts throughout the day. This nauseous feeling usually goes in pair with the feeling of something (mucus?) stuck in the back of my throat. Due to this I have the lingering feeling of having to vomit all the time. This feeling is made worse when I eat something, due to this meals are usually not something I look forward to. I’ve been to the general practitioner several times with these complaints. Each time without results, except linking it to either stress or sleep deprivation. Both of which I don’t feel I am subject to in all situations where I have the complaints.

**Relationship:**

At the moment I have a girlfriend who I love really much. I am however scared to death that if she finds out im not 100% mentally sound, she’ll leave me. Besides that, I’m having the issue that my health complaints come in the way of my relationship with her. For example whenever were out for diner, me not feeling too good after eating, always seems to ruin the mood. I feel that it might be ruining fun and nice moments. Another issue im having is that it costs me a lot of effort to be social. Usually when it’s just her and me, everything is fine, but I find it really difficult to be with more people(like her parents) especially when i'm already not feeling too happy.

**Stress:**

I’ve recently been trough a pretty stressful period in my life. This was my graduation, this just didn’t go as planned and caused me to almost succumb to the stress. However I’ve finished my graduation about 3 months ago, so I doubt Im still stressed about it.

Besides that a different factor of stress might be, that after my graduation I’ve gotten my first full-time job. However due to me really liking this job, I doubt that it’s causing me stress.

**Further worries:**

Besides the issues described above, I have a lot of trouble thinking about the future. I’m scared of what the futures is going to bring and how I should deal with it. I'm also unsure what I want to do with my life, due to this I usually go hide in places I’m familiar with.

Besides that, I do a lot of thinking about the state of the world and humanity, something I shouldn’t do because It causes me to lose hope very quickly and gives me the feeling everything is falling apart.

**Ramifications:**

That I'm not always feeling happy mentally has a lot of impact on my daily life. Mainly in way of being to scared to make life altering decisions. 

I'm also very concerned about not bothering others with my state of mind, so I usually just hide it, or if found out, downplay it so people don’t worry about me.

Of course I have good days where I’m in a good state of mind, I however have the feeling I’m in a bad state of mind more often and often.

I have no idea what to do, and I’m scared to tell this to anyone.

Any tips would be greatly appreciated

That sounds like an exaggeration, but minus using the restroom, I haven't gotten out of bed. We have a 2 bedroom apartment and one room I used for PC gaming and, incase I was off and up late and she worked early have a bed in there. 

So we have been sleeping separately... well she's been sleeping. Every time we talk about it we both cry and say how hard it is. I'm crushed. I literally can't do anything. I'm currently on disability due to a back injury, so thankfully work isn't something I have to suffer through. 

I can't eat, I can't sleep. I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm almost 30, I have no savings because my wife has been studying to become a Veterinarian and I have been working to support us, paycheck to paycheck.

I understand what pain is, emotional pain sucks and I've felt it sometimes, but I don't think other people can actually feel it, because I don't feel what they feel.

200,My mind is somehow allergic to happy mood. Everytime I feel happy and enjoy something (for example having a good time with my best friends) my mind turns around after some minutes of joy. Then my mind turns totally empty and sad and I'm nearly crying and just want to run away even tho on the ouside I'm still happy to others and the situation is the same as before when I was happy some minutes ago.

201,"Call me weak. I would agree. But I just feel like I won't like my own future. I'm gonna try to explain why as quickly as posssible.

So ever since I remember, I was always excited about my future. I mean, all kids do is getting prepared for their future really. So at primary school, I always wanted to be an adult, like most kids, and I always knew what I wanted to do later. Then at high school, you notice that life doesn't work like that. For me it became hard to decide what I wanted to do, but I still was never really stressed about it. However now I've left high school, and have already tried 2 studies I didn't like, and I absolutely hate the thought of my own future. There's simply nothing that excites me. I hated school, but went with the thought: 'If I'm doing well at school, I can get a job that I will really like later!' Now I realised jobs are 10 times worse then school.

(Bit of a rant): My mind just can't deal with the adult life. We're all being treated like a bunch of numbers. And we're being slaves to humanity. No, I rather had just survival of the fittest. Even though that means I would've probably been dead already. We have to work 4 or 5 days out of every 7 dammit. Doing the same, OVER and OVER. For the rest of our lives. What a waste!!

I just can't see myself working in a few years. There are no jobs available for the passions I have. Everytime I read a job or study description, I feel super stressed and depressed cause of how boring and stressful it sounds. I don't think I can do it.

I always told myself it's some sort of sesional depression that people in my age always seem to fall into, and didn't make a huge deal out of it. Since I like discovering the new so much, I know every corner of my town and the couple surrounding ones, and have met many people along the way. I'm okay with that, it's just who I am. But I am tired of seeing the same town, the same people all over. Day in, day out. Every weekday and twice on weekends. It's gotten to a point where I geniunely fear taking the routes I always take, just because I don't want to run into someone I know - Which with my past behaviour is more than very likely. It's like watching an old movie on repeat, hoping for that one new scene that never appears.

I have tried many things to cope with this. I take a different route at a different time to work every other week, I try to meet up with new people from further away (while having to keep travel cost in mind) or just hit up strangers over the web, I go swimming twice a week and go to a different indoor swimming pool every month or so, and so on. Basically do all I can to not have a fixed routine while (hopefully) not alerting any mutuals about my issue. It worked the first couple months, but there's only so many ways to go to work without taking thrice as long. I also don't earn a lot for my country's standards, since I am still just an apprentice.

I have thought about travelling more or even moving out, but whenever I try to make specific plans I remember that I by far don't earn enough to get to a standard of living where I can in any shape or form really change anything. Moving out with a friend into the same flat won't do either, since I'd much prefer to live alone. Guess I just like being alone, looking back at my solo vacation as well. Since moving out isn't an option I probably have to bother my parents with my presence a couple more years lol.

Now, the reason I don't tell myself it's ""muh sesional depression"" anymore, is that last night, at around 1AM, I was standing in front of our bathroom sink; A knife in hand. I stood there, ready to cut myself. Just thinking back to it scares me. Why? Because I was so desperate to get hospitalized, or get in a clinic, or just get literally ANYWHERE in ANY WAY that was not near my house, my friends, my workplace, my family, my bed, my everything.

I have yet to tell anyone about this. I am planning on getting professional help if this does not improve in any way over the next couple days, but I first wanted to search advise in like minded people, perhaps someone who's been through something similar. I know, Reddit shouldn't be considered a ""trustworthy"" place for advice, but I have gotten so many great and kind responses to every issue I had on my old account. It feels wrong to not look out for someone here, like a missed opprtunity.

I want to finish off by thanking everyone that looks into this subreddit's posts and actively supports their authors in their need for an ear. You are truly amazing people, the world needs more like you. If I could give you a cookie, I most certainly would!",25Nov2019,1
204,"hello. i’m a 16 year old girl, a daddy’s girl, but i don’t know what to think of my parents. on one hand, they give me almost everything i want and support me in normal teenager stuff. i would say i live a good and privileged life. but on the other hand, i’ve been dealing with sleep disorders and reoccurring mental health issues since i was about 12 and they don’t make an effort to try and treat them anymore. i don’t necessarily want to see a psychiatrist for my mental illnesses but i’d just like them to notice or acknowledge that their daughter is suffering, because they think i’ve been healed for like 3 years now but the truth is i’m not, and even though i try to throw hints they don’t realise it. and as for the sleep disorder, they tried to treat it at first but they gave up like 2 years ago because they wouldn’t let me take sleep meds and melatonin didn’t work, so i pretty much get yelled at every day for waking up late or, and when i try to explain to them that i really can’t control it my dad looks like he doesn’t really care or know what to say, and my mum always says it’s just a phase and i’m completely normal and i just need to make a choice to wake up early. she seriously doesn’t get it even though i was diagnosed with insomnia 3 years ago, back when she still cared. are they unsupportive where it really matters or am i just a spoiled self pitying teenager?",25Nov2019,1
205,"M21

I’ve had diagnosed depression for 5 years. In the last 3 years I made a trip to the hospital every 5-7 months for meltdowns because I bottle everything up. Ive made massive progress this year towards getting better. The last hospital trip was 1/6/19. But I’m still not out of it. I have rough patches. Often. 1-3 days at a time and I usually fight my way through it. But on the weekends or Mondays I tend to slip up. I feel crippled and weak and have no desire but to sink into my bed and into blackness. 

My parents are very hard on me and expect a lot from me. I don’t always do things quick enough after they ask me, or do things how they expected them to be done. And I hear about every little thing. My mom shits all over me when I’m having a bad day and lay in bed or play video games to get my mind off it. 

I try to explain it to them but I cannot find the words nor will they open their minds to a different perspective where you can’t actually see the illness someone has. They call it an excuse and continue to break me down.",25Nov2019,1

208,"I didn’t quite believe it when the pharmacist told me. I’m 7 weeks overdue on my refill.

I know I miss a day every here and there, but 7 weeks!? I’m completely blown away. How did this even happen?

My mood has been really freaky for a few months now. I thought it was because I’m not working, not in school, spending so much time applying to jobs.. 

But I guess this medicine was actually balancing me out?

I know that’s a stupid statement... I was already on an anxiety medicine &amp; was having a nervous breakdown from work. The dr prescribed a second medicine, the one I keep missing, to keep me from losing my mind.

But since I’m not at that job anymore, I assumed it was incidental. I take the first medicine every night, the second was just over-the-top medicine.

... is the pharmacist going to tell the dr? I hope not. I’m embarrassed now.",25Nov2019,1
209,"Hi, I am a 21y/o guy who is going through his first depressive episode for about 10 months now. It is mild to moderate. My psychiatrist and I believe it started when I moved from home to start college, and I lived alone and didn't make friends quickly. I am on sertraline and going to my psychiatrist regularly and it has helped me a lot. I feel much better now but not 100% yet. 

My main fear right now is recurring depression. I read on wikipedia that 80% of people who suffer their first depressive episode will experience at least one more in their, with an average of four in a lifetime. I obviously don't want that and I wonder if my depression will return. Now, obviously nobody can know if I will but I wonder if my situation might not be one where it will return. See, my depression came alongside a sort of ""quarter life crisis"" and I wonder if, when I get past this and get used to being and adult, maybe I wont have any more episodes (unless something really bad happens in the future, but assuming it doesn't)?

People who suffer from depression caused by divorce, poverty, abuse, etc (none of which applies to me), might suffer more episodes, but I hope I wont once I get past this transition to adulthood.

210,"I \[28M\] have been dating my gf \[28F\] for 3-4 months and I'm probably going to break up with her. It just kills me because I've been in a very bad mental space for the past few years after breaking up with my ex of 3 years and dropping out of grad school. I feel like I'm a very needy person right now. My current gf just can't give me what I need. We've discussed the fact that we maybe just aren't that compatible and it's just very disheartening. I see a counselor about my anxiety and depression and my gf is also very familiar with my issues as well. I just hate that I have to go through with this all over again. When will relationships get easier? I just want to meet someone who genuinely cares about me and gets me. I'm already dealing with a huge empty hole in my life, and having to break it off with this woman will probably make it feel worst.",25Nov2019,1
211,"I'm at a point of frustration now where I don't know what to and feel paralyzed by the thought of trying to get past this. 

I got laid off in early October. Wasn't too heartbroken, I didn't love the job. But I had a good routine: up early to go to the gym before work, eating healthy, never happy at work or fulfilled, but the stuff around it was good.

Since I got laid off, I've basically avoided all or most healthy habits I previously had in favor of playing video games. It's all I do now. I'm avoiding the gym. I don't get out of bed, I stay in bed to check my phone. I talked to my therapist about it, she gave some suggestions (go to the library, try a little bit of the gym) and I've ignored those. 

I haven't found another job yet though I'm looking and have had some freelance work in spots. Money is going to be an issue sooner than later, so I'm definitely stressed about that. 

This is a problem I've had in the past: a couple months of relatively stable habits and good direction forward before abruptly halting them for one reason or another. I don't know what triggers in me but once I stop something I stop it entirely and avoid it like the plague. I know the gym will make me feel better. I know reading books is better than video games. But I just don't want to do those things. 

It feels like I have my circuits messed up, and that for some reason everything points to, ""avoid at all costs. go play or just do nothing instead, it's easier."" I don't know how to rewire my brain to realize that I need to hold myself accountable, that my success is only going to come from me doing something about it, and to take my life more seriously. Sometimes I feel like I'm just floating through it with no effort and I don't know how to wake myself up. 

Would really appreciate any thoughts or ideas to help me with this.",25Nov2019,1
212,"When I was a late teen, I found comfort in writing. Poetry, specifically. Once I got busy with college, it kind of got pushed to the side. Now, several years later, I find myself going through another tough time in life and something that helped me so much once before seems so hard to grasp now. I've tried writing at times when my mental health was good and I've tried at times it was bad.  Those who express their thoughts and emotions through writing, what has helped you to be able to continue creating?

214,"My ex fiancé is currently serving 5 years in prison for continuous domestic violence and violation of a protective order. 

He absolutely ruined my already messed up mental health from living with a narcissistic father , being drugged by a heroin addict and molested repeatedly and being drugged and almost being kidnapped at gunpoint from I can only assume sex traffickers .

I now have a traumatic brain injury and scars all over my face, loss of feeling in one of my fingers , from my ex bf . I have never in my life remembered dreams but for the past year and a half I have had terrifying nightmares every night, at work I am jumping though my skin with anxiety and notice that I jump and get crazy anger when startled by the slightest loud noise.

215,"Hi everyone. I'm in therapy for depression and anxiety but there is a thought, or deep belief, rather that keeps on popping in my head. It's a bit out there, so I was wondering if any of you suffering from mental health issues ever think that way.
I believe I am not supposed to be alive because I have too many defects to be viable, were it not for modern medicine and the sympathy of others. I would have never made it past infancy, were I to live in a nomadic tribe. I have ENT issues, am very near-sighted, and have always been extremely sensitive. 
And because I believe I am not strong enough, or even human enough to be able to hold my own, I believe I have no right have lived this long already. I guess it's kind of an imposter syndrome. Can anyone relate?",25Nov2019,1
216,"I posted here a week or two ago and I wanted to post a follow up. 

1. My anxiety about guns got even worse after the Santa Clarita shooting. I actually had to leave an after school club early because it got so bad. I told my mom who was doubtful but told my school counselor about it, who said that she would talk to me. She hasn’t yet and I feel like this is an urgent issue. One of teachers recommended that I try meditation, which has helped a little bit.

3. You guys said that you thought I might have disassociation so here’s more that I’ve noticed since my last post.I noticed that I have felt like I’m falling every time I disassociate and every time I think about disassociation it happens. I have also started getting a little depressed and not wanting to live anymore. I haven’t self harmed but I don’t know what is causing this. 

4. Do you guys have any advice or tips to help with this? 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",25Nov2019,1

218,"Does it sound like a statement right out a 1-percenter's kid? Something he'd say as he spilled champagne on his pink Versace pants? Ok boomer.

Anyway, this is a sentiment I see a lot with people I know and from what I read online. My personal reason that I got pretty bad anxiety which means that being at any workplace feels nightmarish for me to even think about. To top that off, I'm not really disciplined at all. A common reply to this is ""just get your shit together, be more disciplined, etc"", which I don't disagree with. I can be disciplined about grinding for something if it's for something I want. If there's a job I want or a direction in life I want to go etc.   
But like a lot of you I don't have something in mind that I want to strive towards. It's not depression, it's just that I can't see something that I actually would want to do. But who cares right? I mean you do you, just do what you feel like doing man. Yeah sure, I can accept that idea to some extent but let's not pretend that people are happy with you when you're unambitiously just sitting at home playing video games. Do I just need to buy the who-cares-mentality? The problem is that I do care. I do want to do well, I do want to have good relationships and earn good money and make something of myself. But I don't have the drive, the vision or the power to do so, I don't have the ingredients for it.
