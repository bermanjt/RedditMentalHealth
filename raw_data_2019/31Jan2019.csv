0,"My sister has a severe mental illness and requires long-term care. But she's poor, I believe her insurance is Medi-Cal or Medi-Medi. Are there any state-run facilities that could take her long-term? All of the privately run facilities I've looked into are too expensive for my family. How would I go about finding a good state-run facility? The last time she tried to commit suicide she was released from the hospital psych ward after only a few days. I'm worried if she doesn't get longer-term and continuous care she may succeed the next time. Thank you.",31Jan2019,1
1,"How does a woman who has an extreme facial deformity  deal with difficulty dating and resentment for men, with thoughts like ""men only care about my looks"". This eventually turns into inability to value herself with thoughts like ""my value, as it is precieved by others, is based primarily on visuals and as I get older that value only decreases"".


On one hand I can't tell her that men don't care because she can totally tell how things have changed. On the other hand, accepting that her looks are what prevent her from finding a partner makes it really easy to have low self esteem... How difficult is it to find yourself attractive when the world you live in doesn't reflect it..

She desires affection but she rejects the idea to protect her ego. 

A therapist is exactly what she needs, but what approach does one take to be at peace with her condition.",31Jan2019,1
2,"I’ve been studying up on psychopaths lately and think I’ve come to a profound realization that I have many of the qualities I’ve seen in them. These traits are as follows: (disclaimer/ I’m not trying to toot my own horn at all just trying to disclose all aspects of me)

I have a large ego that drives everything I do, I’m overconfident, goal oriented and persistent. I have trouble with empathy if I think that the person isn’t acting in a way that I find rational and can blame on their own “incompetence”. I have trouble seeing my own flaws and have to have them pointed out most of the time, but can realize them once pointed out. I have have pretty high intellectual abilities and am always in other people’s heads trying to figure out their motivations and predict them. I have lost all “feelings” since the age of 18. I’m very extroverted and get pleasure from human interaction and conversation, and am constantly making moves to appear to others how I would like for them to see me, often changing based on the person and what I think they want. I need to be in control. And I don’t really like to be touched. I’ve maintained a steady girlfriend for 6 years and I love her, but it’s not a feeling it’s in my head, I KNOW I love her because of the qualities that she possesses. 

I’m just confused cause I hit all the marks, but I feel that I would never do someone harm for my gain like the stories you hear. I genuinely love people and animals alike. What am I? Is this a common thing to have? Or am I just being delusional and attributing a false personality to myself?

I was thinking about some more examples earlier this week racking my brain about this subject but I’m sure I’m leaving many things out.  Thanks in advance.",31Jan2019,1
3,"I dont know why but i have been physically and I guess emotionally unable to cry. The last thing I cried from was the ending of a damn video game and I'm pretty sure that was in 2015, maybe early 2016.

The closest I got to shedding a tear was a month or two ago and it was out of pure anger. And it wasn't even the tearing up part, it was barely the sniffling part of crying.

It's not like I'm not sad. I've gone through cycles of general sadness to intense depressive episodes and very close to cutting and/or suicide.

I've tried letting myself feel sad. I've tried watching emotional videos, etc. I've also tried forcing myself. None of it works, which really sucks because I remember feeling better after crying.",31Jan2019,1
4,"Past events taught me at a young age that human contact is bad and, generally thanks to a fairly dissociative and obsessive brain, I just sorta internalized that. Now I have trouble dating due to having trouble getting actually close to anyone. It took YEARS to open up to people I've known since forever. Since I'm an outwardly open and talkative person, this seems weird when i tell my friends about it, and when i do ask, the answers usually aren't helpful (not blaming them, they're just coming from a completely different angle). Any ideas on working on letting people in? I don't want to constantly seem unavailable

Yeah, I've got a therapist and all that",31Jan2019,1
5,"[WARNING: This personal story references themes of suicide and potentially traumatic experiences, once I start talking about intrusive thoughts.]

You’re taking the train. Probably reading something on your phone, perhaps the news, social media, or school notes to prepare for your upcoming lecture. You happen to glance up and notice the guy sitting in the seat next to you, clearly struggling with something. He’s clutching his face, almost clawing at it, slowly rocking back and forth, panting in exhaustion from some ailment you can’t see. Worried, you lean over and ask if he’s okay. He lifts his face towards you, a distraught look in his eyes and says in a hushed, desperate voice:

“I can’t hear my eyes!”

How would you react to that situation? What do you think is going on with that person? He looks crazy but he is clearly suffering. This is in fact an experience that I could personally live, if someone were to notice my struggles in public transport and ask if I’m okay. I probably wouldn’t respond the same way, but that would be the only thought going through my mind.

I have Tourette’s syndrome. I too, before my diagnosis this summer, assumed it was the “swearing disease” just as you probably thought if you have heard about this disorder somewhere from the media. It is in fact a much deeper, more complex condition than most think. 

Tourette’s syndrome is a neurological disorder that causes me to have multiple tics, which are involuntary movements and sounds. I jerk my head and crane my neck. I hit my stomach, chest, neck and face multiple times a day. I cough and squeeze all the air out of my lungs as much as I can to the point of making my ribs sore. I let out high pitched squeaks when I know no one is around me, if I am successful at holding it in until I’m alone, that is.

And of course, the swearing. Involuntary obscene language is one of the odder, more complex tics that only about 10% of people diagnosed with Tourette’s exhibit, much less than what is portrayed in media. Being a part of this group, I’m lucky enough that I can almost always hide and suppress these exclamations in public, but the same cannot be said for the majority of those suffering from this socially isolating tic, which is categorized under a separate comorbid condition called coprolalia.

Since Tourette’s is a neurological disorder, I was born with. I had tics all my life, but they were milder and less frequent. I would sniffle and clear my throat often, or knock my knees together as I walked. Luckily, they practically disappeared in my late teens. It’s only over the summer that they progressively and quickly got worse. 

The important issue about Tourette’s that brings me back to my story is one that is mostly unknown even to those who know about the disorder. Tics are not always completely involuntary. Sometimes, they happen on their own without any warning and with no way to prevent it. Most of the time, they are actually compulsions, much like those found in OCD, where instead of completing rituals to get rid of mental anguish, intrusive thoughts or anxiety, tics are done to get rid of physical distress. In either case the mental or physical discomfort is caused without reason by the disorder.

An intense and sudden uncomfortable and irresistible urge appears at the location where the tic needs to happen, which can feel like a build-up of tension, pressure, or a really bad itch. Completing the precise physical or vocal tic required temporarily relieves this discomfort. Yet choosing not to tic worsens this feeling and becomes excruciating, just like what you would feel if you stopped blinking for as long as you can. Our bodies are riddled with eyes that need to be blinked in a specific way, at random times, all day, every day.

The worst thing that can happen with Tourette’s is being unable to complete a tic for whatever reason. You are being deprived of the option to relieve this quickly building distress and panic sets in. This is what occasionally happens to me as I ride public transportation.

You see, weirdly enough, I have a vocal tic with my eyes. You may in fact be able to replicate it yourself. There is a specific way that I learned to blink my eyes such that it produces an ever so soft clicking sound. I don’t know if it’s the humidity of my eye that’s sticking my eyelids together, making a sound similar to smacking lips when I open them again, or little bubbles of air that get popped. Either way, it is a sound that is very low and even I have difficulty picking it up sometimes.

The problem then arises when I’m on the train and my eye tic starts up. The low rumbling of the engine, the friction of the train tracks and the whooshing of the wind outside, even though these noises quickly get lost as quiet background noise, are sometimes enough to drown out the sound of my clicking. I find myself in the scary scenario where I desperately need to tic, but I cannot complete it, because I lack the necessary auditory component.

I try blinking my eyes harder. I cusp my hands around my eyes in desperation to attempt to amplify the sound. I hold my breath to get rid of any noise I can. If nothing works, the discomfort becomes maddening. I start sweating. I lose my breath. I clutch onto my seat, my face, praying for the next stop to come so that the noise can stop and I can finally hear my eyes.

If I’m lucky I can catch the clicking sound and get a bit of relief, but only in one eye. Now there is an unbalance, one eye produced a click, the other needs to click as well, and the struggle restarts.

This obsession with symmetry, the feeling of my body needing to be even on my left and right sides, is a symptom of OCD. When going through the diagnostic process for Tourette’s back in August,  my psychiatrist agreed with me that I exhibited a few symptoms of this similar condition, but as the meeting was focused on my Tourette’s, and that my symptoms did not appear severe enough to impact my life too much, a diagnosis for OCD wasn’t warranted at the time. It was left at being just a hunch.

But when you’re left lying on your bed fighting off intrusive suicidal thoughts instead of studying for your final exam in two days, it’s more than just a hunch.

During the finals period before summer break started, the build-up of anxiety for the upcoming exams triggered abnormally intense intrusive thoughts, something I hadn’t realized till then that I struggled with. Although I wasn’t and am still not in the least suicidal, they focused a lot on themes of suffering and death.

“You could die anytime, anywhere”

“It could be extremely painful, you could die in a fire”

“You don’t want that, should just guarantee yourself a painless death, take control”

“You should want to die, you’re always at risk of a painful death”

“You should want to die.”

So on and so on, when all I wanted was just to study for my math course. These thoughts scared me, it felt like my brain was trying to convince me to become suicidal, and I fought back. But resisting these thoughts only make them worse as I realized. Like a sinister parrot insisting on squawking in your ear that won’t be shooed away.

“What’s the chance of getting in a bad car accident? Your house burning down? You should just get it over with and end it all.”

Over and over, hours and hours. I had to defer my final exam because of this. It’s a pretty good hunch if you ask me.

The constant background brainstorm in my brain of random thoughts jumping from one to another, most likely caused by ADHD according to my therapist, probably doesn’t help much with these intrusive thoughts either.

Another very little known fact about Tourette’s is that the vast majority of those with the disorder also have OCD and/or ADHD, and are more likely than average to suffer from other issues as well, such as anxiety, depression, autism, and as mentioned before, coprolalia.

Although I knew since I was 6 that something was off, being aware of my tics and certain obsessions and compulsions, I had kept it all bottled in until I was 20, when the sudden increase in the intensity of both these issues pushed me to seek professional help. Until then I simply didn’t know what was going on with me, or who to talk to, or even how to describe the things I was going through.

Lack of awareness and discussion about mental health is an important and impactful problem for many who struggle in silence like I did for most of my life. In fact, most cases of Tourette’s go undiagnosed for many years, and many never get a diagnosis. Lack of awareness also leads to misunderstanding and mistreatment towards those with these conditions, and Tourette’s syndrome is definitely not excluded from that.

I managed to gather the courage to seek help by myself. I got my diagnosis for Tourette’s at my university’s psychiatric services. I now have all the necessary accommodations, for which I am very grateful, and I was taught great coping strategies for anxiety. I will continue my appointments with a psychiatrist here to pursue diagnoses for OCD and ADHD, if I do in fact have them.

Even though this is quite late in my life, I still managed to get the help I needed, and this in part thanks to becoming more aware of not only the very real issues of mental health in our society, but of the many options that are out there to provide help. Public presentations at college and online stories and testimonies were my main source of information.

I hope to be able to convey the same inspiration through my story to help any of you struggling. You can get help. You deserve to get help.

6,"It's incredibly painful for me to interact with people. 
When I get home, my mind and body are tense. The thoughts of what I said keep popping into my head sometimes even for the next 2 days. My mind keeps playing what I said, however there is no emotion associated with, and there is no other kind of dialogue associated with the pictures playing in my mind.

I know I have to work if the bills are going to be paid. But I can't leave because people will look at me then and they'll know. And I know that isn't rational. 

I'm almost 40. I'm scared to leave the house and also scared to talk to delivery people. I don't want to talk to anyone who isn't my husband or my adult children. I'm scared to go outside or talk to strangers.

10,"I have a really bad attention span when it comes to doing independent work, especially with things like English or WHAP where you have to read a lot. This is a problem that's increasingly getting worse and is now affecting how productive I am during school. It's bad enough that I barely do work at home because I get easily distracted, now I can't work well at school either for the same reason.

If there's the slightest bit of noise happening, I can't focus. It's too much for me and I get anxious, frustrated, and overwhelmed. In classes, during tests especially, people shouldn't be talking anyway, so I get even more frustrated because it's super disrespectful. Even when I have ear plugs in and it's almost silent, I can't focus because my mind easily wanders.

I'm not diagnosed, but I'm 99% sure I have maladaptive daydreaming, and sometimes daydreams are all I can think about. If something is boring to me, I daydream. If I'm reading something that actually interests me, then I end up getting too into it and thinking about it for too long. My mind can never get to the point and stick to it for more than a couple of minutes.

It also mentally and emotionally tires me when I do focus. Today for example, I had 2 classes in a row with tests in them. By the end of the test in the 1st class I was feeling a little tired. Once I got to the next class, though, a giant wave of mental and emotional tiredness hit me. I didn't even get halfway through the test bc the tiredness mixed with my usual lack of focus made it impossible to work.

If anyone experiences/experienced the same thing and wants to share about it and what helps them, it'd be greatly appreciated. This is an issue I'd like to fix before college, and getting diagnosed, therapy, medication, etc. is not an option for me.

TL;DR: My attention span is horrible and when I do focus I get tired. If anyone has input or advice, it's greatly appreciated.",31Jan2019,1

15,"Hi, everybody!

I’m going to try and make this as short and to the point as possible.

I’ve lived with depression and anxiety since I was 14 years old. At 21, I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and, just recently, I was also diagnosed with OCD. I’ve been in and out of the mental health system, and luckily I’ve found an absolutely phenomenal psychiatrist, a great therapist, and medication that’s done wonders for me. I also have supportive friends and family. I am stupidly, ridiculously lucky and — I think — privileged. My reality is nowhere near the reality of millions of other people living with mental illness, and that absolutely kills me.

I sat on this idea I had for awhile, and in Spring of 2018 my younger brother began facing thoughts of suicide. That was when I began organizing my mental health project with two good friends. We have created an Instagram (@bloomingbrainproject) to be a mental health companion. We are still in the very early stages, but we’d like to progress into educational videos and begin advocating for what we REALLY need in the mental health system — more beds, shorter ER wait times, more accessible therapies. In the mean time, I need your help.

Currently, we’ve been asking our followers Q&amp;A’s regarding their mental health to create educational posts. We post their answers anonymously. If you would like to help us out, please reply and let me know. It would mean the world to me. If you have more questions first, I completely understand and I’d love to answer what I can. Just let me know.

18,"I'm just going through a very severe depression at age 24. I have so much anxiety and pain and I'm just downright miserable.

I talked to my therapist about my pot smoking. He said that smoking once a week is considered heavy smoking. Because of the heavy amount of THC in today's pot. And because it stays in your system. He said it interferes with my antidepressant medication and prevents me from getting better. The medicine is making me feel better, but the pot gets in the way of that. And according to him, getting high is more important than feeling better. I don't even have any pot right now and won't be getting any until maybe next week. It's not a big deal and I'm not freaking out that I don't have pot...

And he said that using it for long periods of time can lead to increased depression and anxiety. And that it takes away your motivation. Makes you irritable.

I''ve always felt bad about myself. And now I'm taking a medicine that is supposed to make me feel better, but I'm getting high which is preventing me from getting better? I guess I want to feel bad and perhaps pot is making me feel bad which is what I'm used to and don't want to change?

I used to get off on feeling bad. Feeling bad is how I deal with things.

I have a lot of mixed and confused feelings about this. My therapist said that if I was content and comfortable with myself, there wouldn't be any need to get high. And that with pot, a successful and content and responsible person would only use it once a month or one every six weeks.

He said it was no different than an alcoholic who drinks after work because he had a stressful day.

Do you ever feel a tingly sensation sometimes? I've been feeling a nervous sensation in my back...like an uneasiness or something...I think it's anxiety...it just kind of hurts or something? I just feel...uncomfortable. It's like an uncomfortable sensation on the back of my body...like my back area...

My therapist says I was at 1% better...and now I'm at 20%...I have a lot of work to do he says...

Do you think I have a lot of issues? I feel...miserable...uncomfortable.. I just...want to get better...and be...happy. I've never been happy...my mother just wants to see me happy and I can't do it....I'm very scared of the future...

Today was hard...just going to my therapist appointment was so...hard to realize all of my issues...I just feel like such a mess. I feel helpless and pathetic. I have such poor self-esteem

I'm only 20% better and it's scary how much work I have to do..I'm just so nervous and uncomfortable with myself and who I am...

Growing up my sister and I fought a lot. I had severe depression and anxiety. I had to take psych meds and go to therapy. Still on heavy medication and heavy therapy.

She hated me. She was embarrassed by me. I was such a mess in school and was constantly bullied and made fun of. I had no friends and was just miserable.

In college, we went to the same school, and I was just so pathetic and horrible she didn't want anything to do with me.

We never got along. Always fought and bickered. She constantly called me names and told me to kill myself.

She wasn't nice to me.

I never really called her names or anything. I was very submissive, weak, shy, and stupid. I barely passed high school but graduated from college. College was so much easier than middle and high school.

I have a lot of trauma. I'm just such a complete mess and depressed and miserable.

I'm miserable. And what's worse is my sister knows about my secrets and issues. She found things that I didn't want her to know. I used to touch women inappropriately in crowded hallways, and she saw me touching a girl. I quit doing that and haven't done it in years, but the pain is still there.

She moved far away to California and is successful and happy. While I'm stuck at home miserable, lonely, and working a shit job. I feel like a loser, a failure. I feel so unhappy and it's hard to change.

She came over for Thanksgiving and we sort of made up. I apologized for being so shitty and that I'm trying to change, and she said ""Thanks you can do it""

We are friends on facebook. I actually had her blocked for a while but readded her.

We don't talk. We never talked. I'm artsy and she is into science. We just never had anything in common and she hated me so much growing up.

Due to my severe depression and anxiety, I caused a ton of pain and stress in my family.

I have a lot of issues that I am working on in therapy.

I've been texting my sister pictures of her dogs and cat. I think she enjoys them, but never replies.

I asked for her address and sent her a package with some tshirts that I used to wear that no longer fit that I thought she would enjoy. It was supposed to arrive on Friday, and I don't know if she ever got it because she never texted me about it.

I just feel so horrible and unhappy about myself.

Should I text her again and apologize and say how I'm sorry how I failed as an older brother to her?

She never texts me or anything. She never asks how I'm doing or anything like that. She never asks how therapy is going or anything like that. It's like she doesn't care about me or love me...she says she loves me and she gave me a hug...but she doesn't talk to me at all or anything.

My dad also has trouble with his own sister and they fight all the time as well.

I don't know what to do. I feel like I failed as an older brother to my sister. I should have been there for her and took care of her, but I couldn't even take care of myself. I just fucked up so much and I feel so guilty and ashamed of myself. I'm just such a failure as an older brother.

I don’t know what happened, but today I just felt really fucking depressed. Just sad and disappointed in myself. I’m just so miserable and lonely and unhappy.

And it’s fucked up, but I was thinking about suicide again. And it makes me cry to think about and it really hurts and I know it’s not the answer. But I was thinking of buying a hand gun and killing myself. I know that’s horrible and not the answer. I don’t know why I keep thinking of it.

I’m just so unhappy. I feel so terrible. My therapist says I’m making progress, but it’s just so scary how much work I have to do. I just am overwhelmed. And my parents think NOTHING is wrong with me. My mother thinks that me being miserable is okay and that I don’t need the medication and it’s time to come off it. I’m just so miserable and unhappy and I feel like I’m in pain and I just don’t know what to do but keep talking about it.

He says I have all the tools to be happy but…I just can’t seem to figure this out. I just am having a hard time getting better and it hurts and it’s hard and I just feel so fucking confused and lost and scared..

I'm also a Cancer sign. A big cry baby. Do zodiacs mean anything?

I’m cleaning the basement right now, but these emotions are really draining. I just can’t seem to feel happy. I just can’t seem to feel okay with myself and that’s why I really want to buy a gun. I’ve been working and saving money and I could do it. But I’m not going to. It’s just a thought. I’ve had suicidal thoughts ever since I was a little kid.

I just hate myself. I’m just so unhappy and I don’t know how the hell I’m going to get through this. My life has just always been constant misery and sadness. I grew up sad. I’m always sad. Something is always wrong. Something is always bothering me. I’m always unhappy. People say I always look sad and ask what’s wrong and I just can’t figure it out. Why did I end up so fucked up? I just want to get better but I just feel so fucked up and it’s really hard sometimes. I feel like such a fucking freak. I just can’t even take care of myself. I feel so helpless and pathetic

I don’t know why today was so hard, but today is very difficult.

I’m going to call the suicide hotline. I’m crying like crazy right now. I’m not going to kill myself. They are just stupid thoughts. I don’t know what happened, but today I just felt really fucking depressed. Just sad and disappointed in myself. I’m just so miserable and lonely and unhappy.

And it’s fucked up, but I was thinking about suicide again. And it makes me cry to think about and it really hurts and I know it’s not the answer. But I was thinking of buying a hand gun and killing myself. I know that’s horrible and not the answer. I don’t know why I keep thinking of it.

I’m just so unhappy. I feel so terrible. My therapist says I’m making progress, but it’s just so scary how much work I have to do. I just am overwhelmed. And my parents think NOTHING is wrong with me. My mother thinks that me being miserable is okay and that I don’t need the medication and it’s time to come off it. I’m just so miserable and unhappy and I feel like I’m in pain and I just don’t know what to do but keep talking about it.

All I know is just to talk about it. I call the suicide hotline. I talk to you. I talk to my therapist. I talk to some friends. But this pain just won’t go away. I just feel so fucking bad and it’s scary and painful and things are just really hard right now and I don’t know how I’m going to get better. My therapist says there is hope for everyone.

He says I have all the tools to be happy but…I just can’t seem to figure this out. I just am having a hard time getting better and it hurts and it’s hard and I just feel so fucking confused and lost and scared..

I’m cleaning the basement right now, but these emotions are really draining. I just can’t seem to feel happy. I just can’t seem to feel okay with myself and that’s why I really want to buy a gun. I’ve been working and saving money and I could do it. But I’m not going to. It’s just a thought. I’ve had suicidal thoughts ever since I was a little kid.

I just hate myself. I’m just so unhappy and I don’t know how the hell I’m going to get through this. My life has just always been constant misery and sadness. I grew up sad. I’m always sad. Something is always wrong. Something is always bothering me. I’m always unhappy. People say I always look sad and ask what’s wrong and I just can’t figure it out. Why did I end up so fucked up? I just want to get better but I just feel so fucked up and it’s really hard sometimes. I feel like such a fucking freak. I just can’t even take care of myself. I feel so helpless and pathetic

I don’t know why today was so hard, but today is very difficult.

I’m going to call the suicide hotline. I’m crying like crazy right now. I’m not going to kill myself. They are just stupid thoughts.

I don't know why I am going through so much pain. I just don't understand any of this. I don't know what to do. I think I might have to see my therapist once a week rather than every two weeks.

I'm just such a mess and don't know how the hell I am going to get better. It's overwhelming

My therapist says there is hope for everybody. And my last therapist says that everyone deserves happiness. I just don't understand why I keep crying and feeling so fucking bad about myself.

I’ve taken a couple different medications so far (Zoloft, Xanax, Lexapro, Celexa, Ativan and Klonopin). Klonopin was the only thing that truly worked and it still does. It’s the only thing that makes me feel like a functioning adult.

 The only is issue is it has ruined my focus as well as my memory. I have stopped taking it for those reasons alone and am working on natural ways to improve my memory and focus. 

I know you guys are going to recommend therapy and I know that works but things are BAD. I have horrible fatigue (which somehow Klonopin completely demolishes) and feel like I’m ruining my life by being afraid all the time.

I’m 21 and I’ve got plenty things that course through my head. Lost my mother at a young age and grew up in my step family. (2 siblings same mom) (their father remarried with two more children) 

I feel like that’s normal for a young person but it’s gets to the point where I feel as if I’m on auto pilot. Like a mental road block when it comes to critical issues. 

“We’re not even gonna go down this road because who knows what kind of stress it will bring.”

I become very passive about things. 

“Well, I mean it happens.”

I want a backbone but I don’t want to be aggressive like I lash out to be sometimes. 

I want to be assertive. 

I have trauma and have been through counseling before when I was younger. 

I don’t have health insurance and it’s been soooooooo friggin intimidating to set up any kind of appointment anywhere. 

I finally did. Finally. I deserve help. You deserve help. Fuck, WE ALL DESERVE HELP. 

I thought I would be okay. Manage on my own. But wow. There’s so much more of my life I need to live and sometimes my actions don’t reflect me and I don’t want to push people away due to that fact. I am tired at 21 and I need help because I cannot live and love the rest of my life like this.

23,"The title is pretty much as literate as it can get. I have a lot of trouble with keeping my mind ""quiet"" or calm. I guess content is a better word to use. I just tend to think a lot. I think much more than i speak which i know is sometimes seen as a good thing but it backfires so much.

For example, I'll think about something I said to someone or how I said it to someone and worry over that. I know that's pretty common with most people but I can't help but wonder how they handle it. I also deal with a lot of paranoia due to possible having a hyperactive mind? I don't know. 

I haven't been diagnosed with any sort of mental illness and I've had plenty of chances to see a therapist as a kid but I was never willing to actually go to a session. 

The only kind of thyrapist I've been to was my old elementary school counselor but nothing serious was ever brought up or handled there.

But back to the subject, I do tend to worry a lot; over so many things, big and small. I've had many people tell me not to sweat the small things and everything like that and I know its good advice to follow but I just don't know how to follow it. Not exactly.

When I start to think, I think about it all in so much detail. I look into every positive and negative possibility. Of course more negative than positive. I've gotten horrible panic attacks from this. I hate it so much. I feel like it's a barrier to how I'm maturing and handling different experiences.

I guess, what im asking is, how do I shut up that small voice in my head that's always judging everything? That's always telling me not to speak to people that I like speaking to out of fear of saying the wrong thing or saying too little or too much? Or bringing up all the regretful things I've done over and over? I know all of this is extremely common too but it's hurting me way too much.

Should I go see a thyrapist as soon as I have the chance to or is there a more personal way of handling this successfully? 

I also ship off to the army for basic training on the 4th of February. I'm hoping that the mental breaking process will do more good than harm but I don't feel so sure about it as much. I know there will be a thyrapist of some sort there but I really do not want to risk getting discharged.",31Jan2019,1
24,"My girlfriend is 23. We rent housing together, she works remotely. Tries not to leave home without me and scared of strangers. She had an authoritarian father and ward mother. Not in contact with them. 

We promised to help each other. 

But on a present day. She does not behave respectfully, sabotage arrangements. Procrastinates things until I do it myself. For example, cleaning. She's forgot, she has no time, although there is time for games. Do a cleaning once a month, just before the arrival of the homeowner. Does not want to clean up after themselves. If my requests are beneficial to her, then she performs, if not, searches for excuses and transfer a task for later.

&amp;#x200B;

Stubborn . Does not tolerate even the slightest hint of criticism, dissatisfaction with her behavior. If earlier she agreed to change something, now she offers solutions, where I must to adapt.

In conflict  or criticism  or uncomfortable questions, behaves according to a pattern:

She says she does not want to discuss it.

Closes and goes into rejection. Give me the silent treatment. 

At the same time growls, shows a anger if i continue to asking the questions.

Beats the wall \\ pillow \\ bed. Throws items.

&amp;#x200B;

The last time I asked to behave respectfully, firstly she demanded to be left alone, then began to growl and made the sound of her headphones louder.

When I came up and tried to take her hand and calm down, she's hit my hand and then threw a headphones at the laptop screen, kicked the table, turned it over and broke laptop.

Now she walks and pretends that everything is fine and I didn’t have to touch her.

She does not want to admit that her agressive episodes, this is unstable, says that I did poorly to her, that I did not listen when she asked not to continue. That is, I am responsible for her disruption, I am guilty, all responsibility is on me.

&amp;#x200B;

When asked what to do with her hysteria, she advised:

Do not look at me when you are dissatisfied.

Do not raise a bad topics.

&amp;#x200B;

If earlier I thought that she was an immature child or a protest teenager, now I have big doubts about her mental health.

You can ask why I live with her? Love addiction. Secondary benefits and she's helps to  pay rent for a housing.

25,"Hey Reddit! 

I’m just your average college student with a diagnosis of ADHD and I’m struggling a little bit with how Adderall effects me. Affects me? Effects me, I’m sticking with that one. Anyway. I’m very new to the drug. I started taking 5mg dosage thrice daily in December, then I graduated to 10mg in the morning and a 5mg in the late afternoon if I need it.

I’m not sure what’s causing my agitated state, but I’m noticing I might be more prone to overstimulation and to having a hyperactive brain that I can’t shut up, but honestly, I had these problems before I started taking Adderall. I can’t tell if my problem is being exacerbated by Adderall or if Adderall is doing little to no help (and might help more with increased dosage/more time to get used to the current dosage) or if Adderall is doing literally nothing, and any symptoms malignant or benign occur purely from reading that these things can happen and effectively placebo-ing myself into feeling these symptoms. 

Also, I don’t know if this helps any of you figure what’s up with me, but I’m 18.
It’s hard for me to know if any of what I’ll read from you will help, seeing as you don’t know me, but I figured I’d give this a try. It’s at least giving my brain something to do instead of go wild flinching at and chasing down every little new idea.

27,"Something I've been seeing an increase of lately, mostly on Facebook but a bit on reddit too, are statements generalizing *all* people with mental illness(es) and lumping them in one kind of box.

I struggle with multiple mental illnesses. I've volunteered my time to talk to others struggling as well. I've seen and heard a lot. Some interactions end up wonderful, while others not so much.

A mistake I see happening a bit is that people, mostly those not afflicted, assuming their experience with someone mentally ill is what everyone else's experience is.

And lately I've, unfortunately, gotten in a few internet arguments about generalization and use of words with people that aren't being receptive to understand or learn. It's a bit disheartening as some of these people have been in position of power or very popular.

It is true you can attribute certain traits to a mental illness. How else would you be able to diagnose? **However, the same MI doesn't affect everyone the same way.**

This is where words especially matter. You *could* say, for example, ""People with bipolar disorder shouldn't ___ because ___ will happen.""

What would be more emphatic and truthful to say is to word it like this instead: People with bipolar disorder **generally** shouldn't ____ because **it is possible** for ____ **to** happen.

I find wording things the first way can quickly cross the line into ableism and offensive accusations. For example, someone on Facebook said, ""It is terrifying being around someone with mental illness.""

These kinds of statements do nothing but further stigma towards mental illness. When I had pointed this out to said person, they spat swears at me and that she has a right to feel that way, because someone with a mental illness hit her when they were having a PTSD episode.

It would be fair to talk about this in the sense that her fear being valid because of her incident, but it is completely unfair to make blanket statements as she had done. I suggested that she find resources to help her understand mental illness better, but they refused to listen.

I'm sure many of us on this sub can relate to the feeling of being generalized or unfairly judged due to stigma, and I'm not trying to preach. I just needed to vent because it gets exhausting constantly having to see sweeping statements of things that are not true. People tend to get fixated on the notation that having an MI can cause something negative to happen, while neglecting to see that an average person without an MI can also do something at any time that could possibly lead to something negative occurring **too.** We're all people.

28,"Three years ago I was diagnosed with PPD and was prescribed Lexapro. After an allergic reaction after nine months I switched to Paxil. Three months later I (stupidly) listened to my PCP who advised me that I didn’t need the meds and should stop immediately. Within 3 days I was in full blown withdrawal. I had to slowly taper myself off for the next 10 months and then I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and put on Lamictal. That was a little over a year ago.

In September I found a someone related full-time job at a nonprofit I’m passionate about. I poured my heart and soul into it 100%. All of my energy goes into my job. It is very high stakes and stressful and I’ll admit my sleep and health have definitely suffered as a result. But being so focused on my job helped me mentally - its my ONE thing to be proud of. Today our department director sent out an email saying that our numbers are too low and that they are unacceptable. Our department is only 3 people and 2 of us have only been taking our own sales since December so obviously our numbers should be lower. He said that this isn’t an excuse and that we have all just been sitting around doing nothing. I know that I’m too sensitive but this hurt me so badly because I try SO SO hard every day. I literally got hives on my drive home from being so stressed, and then threw up when I got home. Then of course, I cried.

And I’ve been on medication and been to therapy for all of it but it’s really not cutting it for me. I feel so hopeless and so low and I really don’t want to do this anymore.

Both of my biggest escapes are gone.

Sleeping and video games. 

I can’t bring myself to sleep anymore since I’m plagued by nightmares every night and wake up extremely stressed and filled with dread and it’s such a pain to deal with.

And video games are becoming much harder for me to enjoy.

I’ve started having compulsions when I’m playing for the most meaningless things and I don’t know how to deal with it.

Half the time I can’t even play because I spend an hour turning my TV on and off because it doesn’t turn on how I want it to and if I try to play without turning it off and giving in I get extremely anxious, to the point where I feel physically sick.

Another thing I’ve been doing is in Sea of Thieves, you can pick your weapons from a weapon chest, and I’ve just been scrolling back and forth between the weapons for hours trying to make sure everything’s perfect. It makes no sense to explain but I just get extremely anxious and feel the worst emotions possible.

School is getting harder and harder as I start to lose trust in my friends since I’m getting more and more paranoid for no reason and I’m trying to end relationships with people I’m close with so nobody gets sad when I inevitably die because I’m super paranoid about that too.

I’m having a really hard time right now.

In Canada we have this BellLetsTalk thing going on and it just makes me feel ten times worse since everyone is posting about how you should always make sure everyone is happy and how mental health is so important but I’ve been silently suffering alone for so long and I can’t do it anymore.

I hate therapy, it’s really not for me, but I feel like even just a group of friends going through the same thing would be amazing. We could play games together and talk about our problems and stuff.

But sadly all of my friends just talk about their next session where they’re gonna just drunk and stoned as hell and I’m sitting here uninterested in messing with my brain anymore than it’s messed with me which in turn makes me feel more pathetic and weak and like I’m not meant to be here.

I have social anxiety and it's something I've been dealing with my whole life and I'm used to the things that come with that, and at first I just thought these symptoms where another offshoot of my anxiety but they slowly have been getting worse and more prominent in my day to day making me think it's something more than just that. I'm not here looking for a diagnosis, I just want some other people's take on my situation and maybe some advice on some steps I could take.",31Jan2019,1
49,"I spent five, very difficult months without it.

It’s been two weeks of taking it and I’m already doing so much better. I can’t believe I was dealing with the anxiety for so long! No more calling in to work. No more ulcers from all the excess stomach acid produced in the attacks. I don’t have to be sick every day anymore. I can live again. 

Everything else I take has at least one negative effect (Paxil being almost entirely negative)– except the Buspar. I would definitely recommend it for anyone dealing with GAD. It lessens the physical anxiety response a lot.

50,"Guess this can be triggering for people with panic attack so if you are feeling down please do not read

Me and my boyfriend had a flight about something extremely stupid yesterday and I asked him I can do for him to make things ok and he gave me the most stupid answer you can give someone that is struggling with mental health: I want you to be happy (or at least the same meaning as that)

I cannot give that to him?! He has said that to me so many times and I can't do anything to just fix myself and become someone I'm not because I have had this for years and is honestly having problem separating my mental health to my personality. I just simply cannot give that to him and I am so extremely tired of trying to not show it to him

I freaked out, I lost control and started screaming and hitting the pillows in the sofa. I wanted to tear all hair from my head. I do not even remember half  what I said. He got frustrated and screamed back at me and stormed out of the room and I just... Collapsed. I cried like a maniac, just saying ""no, no, no"" all over and keept on screaming, walking around the room like a animal in a cage. I wanted to hurt myself so bad and I have not felt like this for at least 3 years. I thought I was fine. I thought I was doing well, that I could be better but after 3 years I ended up in the same spot again.

The panic episode ended with me running to him screaming his name and collapsing on the floor infront of him and lost myself to the spiral. When I got back to my senses he were there holding me telling me I was fine and doing one of the things he knows helps me when I'm having anxiety. But he has never seen a full blown panic attack like that and I'm so fucking embarrassed. I should be better that this! I was better then this!

We sat there in the floor for a while, he gave me some water and I asked for forgiveness for yelling at him. And then he said one of the things that makes me love him so much: you were not irrational, some of the things you said makes alot of sense. He always sees me behind the panic, he knows it's just... A sickness and not really me. He tried telling me that in the floor but my brain was a bit foggy, it still is. He then made sure that I went to bed and got to sleep. 

Now it's morning and I'm at work, feeling lost and like I'm not good enough. How am I going to be able to look him in the eye when I get home? How can I be the person he wants me to be without stop being me? How are we going to be happy together if we only drag  each other down all the time, he with wanting so much more if life, go in adventures but due to depression never getting there and me that gets sensory overload as soon as I'm away from home for more then a day ?

for an example the one thing everyone says is the first step is to tell someone. that you have people who care about you, you just need to tell them and they will help you. i don't have any friends only my family and i have been telling my family ever year that i need help and i am scared of myself since i was 12 and have gotten no help. im 18 now and feel so betrayed and embarrassed about how weak i am. i feel like sometimes i don't want to get better because they don't deserve to see me good after how bad they have treated me like i deserve this. i dropped out of school when i was 14 and have been home bound since. i leave the house 1-7 times a year and i am suffering. i have asked my parents so many times for help when i was minor that i stopped all together because of the reaction. it was always like i am hassling them i am unappreciative of what they do for me and i shouldn't ask for more or it was brushed off as a maybe and was ignored.  they are abusive parents and i know i need to get over it but i have siblings who i thought where there for me and have recently shown me they are not and it has hurt me a lot. i had a suicide attempt 2 weeks ago but i was too scared to make my siblings feel like it was their fault.  so i told them what i did and they all just yelled at me and blamed me and didn't call anyone. my dad didn't even get out of bed when they told him he just yelled at me and told me to get my shit together. i just had to push through the medication i took. i shook all night and didn't feel conscious for 2 days after. nothing has been said since than and i feel so lost. i do not want to be a burden and i know it is not their job but what is family for then. i feel thrown away now that i am an adult and now i know it is my responsibility but i just don't know what to do. what do i do where do i go i don't have any money and my health card (canada) that would cover my stay anywhere is expired. and if i do get help what after that i go home for my family to treat me so bad and make me feel worse i'm an adult but i don't feel like one i am so lost i need someone to help me please. my plan for my future feels like just to become a junkie and maybe laugh sometimes with people and one day my heart will stop and my family wont know where i went.  any real help is gladly appreciated i feel pathetic like this like a kid but i am one i haven't been anywhere since i was 14 i am ignorant to everything. ty.",31Jan2019,1
55,"I am a senior in HS with strong academics and a strong interest in Computer Science and have a programming job.  


I have had pretty bad relations with my parents due to 3 divorces and a below average living arrangement. I am not some rebellious kid that is venting that my parents are dumb, but I know for a fact that they are average / below average intelligence and I don't resent them for it.  I am extremely ambitious and want to be successful so badly to the point where I think something is ""wrong"".   


When we argue (almost never now but when it happened in the past) we threw insults back and forth and got extremely angry to the point of yelling and one time even hitting me repeatedly and forcing me to go stay at a friends house for a few nights. Obviously this is partly due to my immaturity during that time and my lack of self awareness to know that the argument was pointless and I should have just listened.

Now, about 1.5 years later I feel like I lack emotion. Don't get me wrong I have friends and love to shop and travel, and with my job I have a lot of freedom to eat out more and get into fashion.  


When I argue with my parents now I don't feel anything like anger or the urge to cry like I used to, in fact I keep a level voice to the point where I sound cold. I ""love"" money, not obsessively but to the point where I without thought reject going out with friends almost 95% of the time in order to work. For example I have skipped every single one of my high-school dances / sports events even though I have a pretty large group of friends. I tell myself things like I won't help my parents even in the future because they didn't help me (in fact they are in debt and leverage money and are super cheap with things, for example not paying for small things that are necessities and telling me to ""see how it feels to pay for me"").

57,"Have major depression and GAD with a history of starving myself as a self-harm method. Typically in depressive modes during the school year I barely eat or get enough sleep. 

For about a year now I’ve become more conscious about my weight. I looked at old photos of myself between 120-125lbs and I felt horrified. I thought I looked fat despite being at a healthy bmi (I’m 5’2”). I remember freaking out because my clothes started getting snug and I was scared to go above a size 6. It was awful enough being a size 6. I’ve started feeling a lot more sick and haven’t been able to eat very much. Because of my schedule (in college) on Monday and Wednesday I don’t have time for a meal until after 3 and I don’t really like or eat breakfast but have at least tried to eat a granola bar or donut in order to take my meds in the morning. Whenever I do eat it’s usually junk food. The dorm’s cafeteria food being just “okay” has made it worse for me to eat a full meal. Now when I try to eat I can’t finish, even when my portions were small. A lot of times I don’t want to eat because I feel sick. I’ve also gotten scared of gaining weight. Last time I weighed myself I was 104. (2-3 weeks ago) But now I look in the mirror and I can see my ribs more and I’m worried I’ve lost more weight. My mom keeps pointing it out ever since I started losing weight (I actually had gained weight during that time BECAUSE I was starving myself) and now I think my friends are starting to notice my eating habits. One in particular questioned me about having not eaten all day, and I unconsciously started saying “It’s fine, I’m used to it” but cut myself off too late. I ended up making it more obvious after I started stuttering and panicking because I realized what I had just implicated. It wasn’t the first time I’d told him I hadn’t eaten all day. He didn’t press further but I started realizing that it’s a lot worse than I thought. I’m not restricting because I want to punish myself, but because I just... dont want to eat as much anymore.

I don’t really think it’s anorexia. I’m eating, but it’s not a lot. I can’t eat much because I get nauseous easily. And I’ve been a lot more worried about my weight and my body overall. Sometimes I just feel averse to food and get sick even thinking about eating. But I force myself to. 

Im getting out of a depressive episode right now, and while life is honestly going really great I’m still struggling with my own health, especially physically. My lack of sleep and exercise partnered with my struggle to eat i think contributes to this cycle of constantly feeling sick and anxious. I want to break out of it but I just feel... sick and confused and scared. I don’t know. I just really needed to vent. I have friends and my parents knew about my periods of unhealthy eating but nobody knows that I’m going through one right now. I’m scared to tell anyone in real life. I want to get better but I just feel overwhelmed.",31Jan2019,1
58,"Not sure if this is the correct sub to post this, if It is not please remove the post mods and direct me to the correct one if possible.

&amp;#x200B;

(Note this beginning is going to sound strange so bear with me) About a year ago I made an observation that at any given point in time we experience THAT as the present. I thought about this a lot, as in like ""Woah I experienced last night as the present but now its already this morning."" I know that is strange but I found it interesting. At some point I began using it to get through difficult things, like if I knew something I would not enjoy was going to happen(lets say a presentation in class in front of a lot of people for example) I would realize that from my future self's perspective It was already over and I was at home comfortable etc. This was not something that was on my mind often, but it was there. This is where other parts of my personality began to conflict with that view. I am Christian, and although from my beliefs I  should not be afraid of death necessarily, it petrifies me.  Although I consider myself Christian, small doubts have made this fear worse as I question if I would just cease to exist.(Note I do not wish to convert from Christianity, nor do I wish to change my religious beliefs). This slowly spread to the fear of death from my mother and father, as they are rather old for my age, each with certain health issues, especially my father. Once I moved to college(In my second semester of freshman year currently) It got worse again. I would fear waking up one morning to get a call that my father or mother was dead. That stayed with me most nights for a while, and still does sometimes. 

&amp;#x200B;

This fear has started to warp how I experience life, since I start thinking how easy it is for me, my girlfriend, parents to just suddenly die in a freak accident. If I do not hear from any of those people via text for more than a couple hours my mind starts racing thinking how they are dead etc. Back to the initial statement, that thinking about how the future is the present in a way compounded with these fears, and now It terrorizes me that the day I'm at my mother, or fathers funeral is already here, or what scares me more is I am on my own death bed dying, or already dead. I get that the chances of me living a long life are pretty good, but with that warped view on experience/time its as if I am about to die any second. Most nights when I go to sleep I let my thoughts wander as I drift to sleep, but ever since I have been afflicted with this I spend nights thinking about these fears and emotions, scared, sometimes crying, and overall furthering this crisis.  A day does not go by that I do not think about myself or my loved ones dying and its started to impact me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am unsure how I am supposed to tackle this. The college only offers three free therapy sessions so even if those could help I would only be able to get limited help. The only person I discuss this with, even a little bit with is my girlfriend but I don't think there is anything she can do. 

&amp;#x200B;

(Another note, I don't have my license to drive. At first it was laziness and lack of a reason, but now its out of fear since I always remember how likely it is to die in an accident, or how easy it is to mess up driving, make one small mistake, and either kill me or my passengers.)",31Jan2019,1
59,"I can memorize all kinds of crap, but I forget ordinary things like names of characters from shows that I watched for years or simply words that I use frequently.

It's weird, but it's the only medication that also makes me have fewer/less intense suicidal thoughts and calms my intense self-hate, ironically it doesn't help much with anxiety at that dose. I take the smallest daily dose that helps to reduce the frequency of breakdowns and prevents my brain from melting/self-harming. At higher dose it could probably smash my avoidant personality disorder with a brick, but even without side effects I know it would be a lie, not a real solution.

63,"I don't know when I started to feel broken. I've had issues since my parents divorced when I was 11 - self harming, hyper-sexuality, sneaking out at night (I looked at the stars, but still). After my grandmother's death just over a year ago, I know something changed. I used to be able to do things and now I can't. I know I need to get help. I saw a psychiatrist on Dec. 10 and was prescribed Prozac and it helped at first but now I just feel numb as ever. I just sat in line on the suicide help chat for over an hour before I gave up. I'm failing in school (or at least I will be, the semester just started), my personal relationships are lacking, I'm increasingly distancing myself from my friends, the things that used to matter don't, I smoke weed daily to try to not think about my ex boyfriend and my dead grandmother and my childhood, hell I smoked cigarettes for the first time at a party last weekend and tonight I went out and bought a pack and smoked two! And that's because I was out of weed! Right now I'm just unable to do anything.

I just don't know what I'm looking for in medical terms. I had a boyfriend in high school who went to two different mental care facilities so I know what I'm thinking of but my insurance doesn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I need help. I think I need real, professional psychiatric help. Because I'm not happy. Honestly, I've been thinking about suicide a lot more lately. I know I won't do it because of my mom, but I shouldn't do it because of ME, yknow? Like I should want to live for myself, but sometimes I just don't. Sometimes it feels like everything is crushing down on me and I can't lift the weight or fix anything. I want to keep up appearances as this happy go-lucky girl, your typical college student, but I don't know if I can keep that up anymore. I don't know if I can keep telling myself ""fake it til you make it"" because it doesn't seem like I'm going to make it right now. I feel like I'm going to ruin my future by not doing well in my classes now but I also feel like I don't even have a future. I'm just so lost. 

&amp;#x200B;

And what sucks is in the morning I'll wake up and think, ""Well last night was weird"" and never think of it again until the next day or week when it happens. I smoke weed everyday because I've begun to rely on it to not think or feel anything. I can't keep this up. I don't know how to talk to my mom and tell her I need to take this semester off to go live in a care facility, even though we just paid thousands of dollars for this semester.

Whatever im going through is ruining my relationships and preventing me from doing basic shit like returning calls, leaving my house, and talking to my family. I feel like im constantly nervously obsessing over one thing or another.  Im currently in online school because my anxiety got so bad in public school I would uncontrollably throw up and was constantly sick to my stomach. Once i left in 2017 i cut off all of my friends from my old school and my first girlfriend without any explanation because talking to them became so incredibly stressful and I still feel like a fucking awful person for it. (A big part of cutting them off is that im in the closet and if my family found out i had a girlfriend i dont know how they would react so i became paranoid theyd find out). Over the rest of the year I was unmotivated, numb and miserable and when i wasnt that i was overwhelmingly anxious so in October of 2017 i asked my dad if i could see a therapist again and a week after i asked I was dropped from medicaid. Since then he tried getting me insurance again and i no longer qualified for the options he could afford so he said he would pay out of pocket for the sessions. he tried making an appointment once and gave up when they never called him back. Since then i have repeatedly asked but he always says ""okay, well we'll see"" and then nothing happens. I continued to feel unhappy and miserable for the first half of 2018. around august i started to feel better and finally thought id be done with feeling like shit for good other than being anxious. Now im starting to fail online school because I havent returned my teachers calls in weeks. I begin to panic, hyperventilate, and feel like im choking when i even think about calling them back. Ive also stopped talking to most of the few friends i do have because even just keeping a conversation going and returning their text has become exhausting while the friends i do gather the energy to consistently talk too im paranoid ill loose.

71,"So this is kinda hard to explain but basically, for a really long time now, i would say i was ""dissociated"" in some way for more than a year. Since about sometime 2017, something i've recently been fully aware of is that for some weird reason, my head would try to PHYSICALLY FEEL stuff like noises, sounds, and even movements that i see. For example, if im listening to a song, i'll FEEL each sound sometimes in my ears, sometimes my ears and a little bit of throat, i know it makes no sense but its the best way to describe it. I think i started off doing it intentionally for some reason and subconsciously continued to until it became natural. So by doing this, it really changed the way i experienced stuff and i feel like doing that was a result of me not being fully present. Since i've been aware i've tried to make it go away by just being in the present and getting out of my head, but it's harder than i thought. Something that i find weird is that sometimes when i try i'll have brief seconds of forgetting everything and just being in the moment but then my arms or maybe my chest or both will start feeling super tense and have me feeling nervous so i'll just go back. I think a lot of this is me overthinking but i don't know. What should i do? Should i see a therapist? ",31Jan2019,1
72,Yesterday I had a breakdown and forgot I had lit a candle but cause I was having a breakdown I left the house to clear my head got a phonecall saying my room was on fire went home to see what had happened I opened the door and my family started beefing me then my dad said he's gonna knock me out and I had a crazy panic attack and broke my car windscreen. It was so weird one minute I was at my house the next minute I was 20 mins away with a broken windscreen.,31Jan2019,1
73,"I feel like I am a really bad boyfriend/friend/person to a degree, which is why I don't seem to easily connect to people and not have friends at all, and people tend to generally have a dislike to being with me. 

In general, I am a rather negative person... I criticize a lot on other's habits and ways of living (those that stem from personal will and decisions). I tend to dislike a lot of people too, mainly based off the other point, and more often than not I think that my pressence is not wanted or desired, eventhough I don't necessarily make it known that I dislike someone by body/facial expressions, or telling them. 

In the past, I was physically and emotionally abused by my mom. Although she was highly protective and loving, I think that her desire to keep me safe and desire to make me be a better individual took her in the wrong direction and lead to her behaviour towards me, which I now seem to emulate. I curse just like she did, I am resentful just like she is towards other people, I am not good at social events just like she is, and I don't do any sort of drugs just like she insisted on me not doing. 

Now, enter my girlfriend... She is the true definition of a physicologically-stable person. She had a super normal childhood with a mom that took care of her all of her life, a good, hard-working dad, and although her family had their own issues, none of them were particularly bad. In general, she has trouble understanding how other people feel when going through problems (not necessarily me but her friends). For example, she has a few friends who complain about how sad they feel and whatnot, and she tends to feel a little bored of listening, and goes with the usual, but I 100% understand them and am emphatic towards them. 

Now, in our relation, her lack of true psychological problems has helped me be a good individual towards her. I respect her with all of my heart, help her with any other problem she might have, love her unconditionally, and overall she does the same with me and we both have built a strong and mature relationship over the course of our 4 and half years, with a few tiny discussions here and there that we have been able to talk and find solutions and possible commitments through. 

The thing is -and where the problem lies- that there are 2 parts inside of me that govern my head and thoughts. My rational thoughts, which is what has helped us get everything we have gotten so far at a personal level (trust, empathy, honesty, love, respect, learning from mistakes etc.), and this is the reason why she is with me and keeps her by my side everytime, since I am able to understand what goes wrong and fix it for a better future for us. 

And then, there's the ""evil and toxic"" side of me, which I believe may be the negative thoughts rooted in my head from my self. I try to not let take it over our relationship, but I can't prevent it from taking over me. Whenever she goes out with a specific group of her friends (which I don't really like), my evil side gets mad at her and sad? that she hangs out with them, and posts pictures of them on social media. However, my rational side knows its perfectly fine for her to hang out with whoever she likes as long as she's safe, so a struggle inside of me happens. Of course, rationally, I tell her to go and have fun and take pictures (the irony). But internally, I suffer since that dark part of me dislikes it and it makes me feel terrible and adds up to a depression I've been having about my relationship with people. 

We have enough trust for me to talked to her about this whole thing, and she does her best at trying to help me. However, she and I understand that she cannot stop seeing friends, or posting pictures she likes just because I don't. And rationally, I understand it, but irationally, I don't and that drives me nuts, and it frustrates me to not be able to complain about it, or see any changes. 

This struggle drains me mentally, and as I have said before it all adds up to my lack of social skills, and general inability to do a lot of things, and results in me feeling great sadness, frustration and many other feelings. 

How can I deal with this mental struggle? Thank you for any tips. ",31Jan2019,1
74,"I’ve only recently come to terms with my mental health even though I feel like I’ve been suffering for years. It’s only been this year that I’ve actively sought help. I feel like it’s beginning to be disruptive towards my education, I struggle to make it into my classes which in turn just makes me feel even worse about myself. Even though I’ve talked to my personal tutor about it and I’ve been going to counselling, I still feel like they don’t get it and that all the meeting are just part of some procedure they have to go though...they don’t really care.

I feel like I was doing well up until now. Today I’m having a bad day, I feel very alone and inadequate like I’m not trying hard enough especially since it’s my final year at uni. I am frustrated that I even feel this way about myself because I just want to be able to get on with my day but instead I’m unable to get out of bed. ",31Jan2019,1
75,"Hello there! I’ve never posted here on this subreddit before so if I do anything wrong please inform me and I’ll correct myself. Its 3 in the morning and I guess I just needed to ask.

This is not something that’s happened until recently but sometimes when I hear specific names or usernames of people I begin to panic. 

For example, around 6 months ago an acquaintance of mine named Taylor began to separate me and this girl (his best friend) I was in somewhat of a relationship with (and my first relationship nonetheless) until finally he asked her out himself and they started dating which cut me out completely. Now whenever I hear/read the name Taylor I immediately grow tense. The back of my neck begins to tingle, I can feel myself sweat and there’s a sudden “thud” of heaviness in the center of my chest along with the urge of wanting to run away or barricade myself of some kind and can on occasion grow hateful. After several minutes it slowly goes away and is replaced by an overwhelming sadness or a hollow feeling depression/ lack of motivation or energy.

The same goes for a “cam girl” that I knew my ‘girlfriend’ was into. I remember her telling me that she had gotten off to her videos because the cam girl would just post videos of her mashing her boobs together and immediately I felt myself grow tense and emotional with the same symptoms. I actually only decided to post this because I had been scrolling through another subreddit only to find a post of hers with the same username and got to the point where I began to cry. 

I don’t mean to sound whiny or pathetic or anything like that, honestly I just want to know why this happens or if it’s even normal? Before 8 months ago I’ve never experienced anything similar to this that I can remember... if I did take up your time however I deeply apologize. ",31Jan2019,1
76,"I have been made to feel guilty for all the things I have went through in my childhood, from abuse to neglect- even though I know they weren’t my fault I can’t help but feel guilty. I have been to therapy before but was told to leave by my guardians- however, I am going to return in a few weeks to a new therapists which is two years later than the first.

I was just wondering if anyone feels this way and if they have any tips on how to cope with it?; because it is known guilt is one of the worst things people have to deal with.

77,"Hi guys.

I am wondering if I could get some help/advice on some herbal medication I am taking for anxiety and depression.

I am currently taking St Johns Wort, the standard bottle from Holland and Barrett (Maximum Strength) 284mg capsules, twice daily, so approximately 600mg daily.

It has helped me immensely with my anxiety and depression, and have been taking it for approximately 7 weeks now. But I feel as though I get quite anxious sometimes physically, and feel that maybe upping the dosage may help.

My question is this: I have read many studies online that say the standard dose for taking St Johns Wort is 900mg daily. I don't understand why all of the St Johns Wort products I have found in the UK are so low dosage compared to this? There are some 'One-a-day' tablets that are only half of that (450mg). So I'm hesitant to up the dosage to 900mg because the bottle says not to - is there a reason for this? Is it safe to take 900mg like all the studies suggest? Are they just covering their backs by greatly reducing the suggested dosage on the labels?

Any advice and help would really be appreciated.

Many thanks!",31Jan2019,1

79,"I am a sixteen year old girl and have always been hypermotional. I've been struggling with my mental health since I was thirteen. I spent the first two years of high school with a constant feeling of anguish and oppression on my chest, i was suicidal and practiced self harm daily. I thought of ending it all many times but never did because the love i felt for my friends and family would always stop me eventually. I got help and i've been taking meds for almost a year now but they never seemed to work. I started alternating severe mood shifts and complete apathy and then, probably as a coping mechanism, my emotions just shut down. I haven't felt a thing since the start of 2019. I tried  to commit suicide two weeks ago and i was hospitalized in a child neuropsychiatry ward for a week.

Any tip is well accepted.",31Jan2019,1
80,"I’ve vented to people recently but, while they did respond and try to support me, I feel like they did it just to shut me up (this is one time I’m praying I’m overthinking it).  So, this is my last ditch effort to get my story out:

So, I’m on the spectrum (High functioning Asperger’s) and I was always the outcast/exploited (for intelligence, not trying to be cocky so I’m sorry if I come off that way) person in social groups and I developed social anxiety as a result.  Once middle school hit, I got consistently depressed and developed trichotillomania (like what the one woman had on “My Strange Addiction; hair pulling and consuming which has stuck with me but more so hair twisting and less eating).  My parents, not knowing any better, started punishing me for it thinking I was acting out until my barber of all people diagnosed me due to some reason I’m forgetting now.  As middle school marched on I was admitted to therapy for expressing me wanting to die (and what they didn’t know was I was writing suicide notes in Chinese either because: I meant it but I didn’t have the balls to go through with it or to vent stress and have nobody understand what I was writing).  High school came, Freshman year was me just being depressed all of the time and when Sophomore year came around, I met me (now ex) GF of 3.5 years.  We were in love but one night we got into an argument and she nearly ODd on her depression meds (then my therapist berated me and telling me how bad I was for arguing).  Junior and senior year were slightly better but I started using games, snakes and m*********** as coping strategies (censoring because I’m not sure if it’s allowed, but you can guess what that is).  Freshman year of my college career at SUNY ESF began and I was super depressed because I had separation anxiety and never overcame it until then, however I made some friends (who I lost because I was still clinging to my anti social ways).  Spring semester arrives and I was super depressed again (it’s been a cyclic pattern ever since I had it) and a friend asked if I wanted to hook up with her, and me being depressed and lonely (long distance didn’t sit well with me) said yes.  However I instantly regretted it and called my GF ago confess...needless to say it took forever to mount that hurdle.  Sophomore year came and all was well however depression and anxiety kept spiking and waning and it was physically draining, but still good since I got to nerd out over snakes.  Now come my Spring semester and I broke up with my GF because of her driving while high and making fun of it (she knows my stance on drugs and still did it) and I’ve relied on friends to vent to and they sort of articulated what they said to make it seem like they care while they probably don’t since whenever I try contacting them they open my message it and read it, but never respond (they’re probabky busy but I doubt it because their SC stories say otherwise).  Now I’m basically nothing but an exhausted introvert whose disorders are getting to a point almost comparable to that of when I was in middle school and I’m drained of the fighting I’ve done for 8 years and I kinda just want it to stop: the anxiety, depression, numbness, hair twisting, lack of friends.  I just want to finally rest and have days where I’m happy and go-lucky.  I don’t know what to do anymore...",31Jan2019,1

83,"Ok so last summer I was 13 and was a junior counselor at a kids camp. A junior counselor meant I was just volunteering and there were older actual counselors. So each week we went to a different camp, so I was only at this certain camp for 2 days. So the first day I was there, a 19ish year old approached me and asked me if I wanted to hang out with him. I said yeah thinking nothing about it. So we go to the pool with the camp and he's hits looking at the kids and he randomly goes ""you look like you've had a rough life"" and I just brush it off and I'm like ""okay??"" And he tells me how when he was my age his cousin raped him but it's no big deal and he forgives his cousin even though his cousin is in jail now. Again, I didn't know what to say so I just brushed it off. Here's where it gets really weird. I was feeling super awkward so I started to like do some standing up stretching (I get really awkward when I'm nervous) and he goes ""what are you doing"" and I go ""opening up my hips cause I have gymnastics later today and I want to be ready"". (Yes, I didn't think that though that was really stupid to say) then he goes ""open them up a little wider"" and I was so uncomfortable I didn't do anything. So we just continue on and he looks at me and starts telling me which kids who are in the camp (who are six and seven) are going to be ""stoners"" and end up in jail and stuff. Doesn't that seem a little inappropriate to say to a 13 year old?? So after the pool trip is over we go back to the camp and he's like ""wanna open up those hips again?"" And at this point I'm triggered so I snap and I tell him to stop, but he still did it even louder almost so the kids could hear just to annoy me. It was All variations of ""kids did you know your junior counselor opened her hips for me??"" Or ""open your hips just for me"", etc. I ended up going back to the camp on the second day I was required and he kept bringing it up. Opinions on how I should handle this??",31Jan2019,1

88,"Reality is a beautiful thing and I miss out on it a lot. In my experience their is nothing more depressing than being able to only live 10% in the present moment. 90% of the time I live in my own head, creating stories and constantly thinking about what could go wrong only to completely forget and/or ignore every good thing that has happened to me or has been said to me. I forget my accomplishments, exponentially second guess my ambitions, and beat myself up over things I have no control over. This mental story telling is happening 24/7 and getting up in the morning is honestly the worst part. I have dreams of things that I had in the past that I no longer have now and wake up back into my mental prison. ""Just kidding, your still a loser"" My brain will tell me. I tell myself how things could have been different if I made a different choice, How I ruined my relationships by being too insecure, How I missed out on chances to be happy, how I failed to meet a goal because I didn't try hard enough etc. Its as if I'm living in a never ending nightmare. A Nightmare that filters reality and turns it into this evil thing, even if the environment and the people in it are good. My brain is like a broken garbage disposal in which it allows all of the good times I had and the memories associated with it to go down the drain but it filters out and keeps the bad memories in my head for another story.   


Consciously I am very aware of myself and my mental process. I have heard a wide range of vices and tips on how to deal with anxiety that I try to ingrain into my psyche everyday. I have seen professionals for it that have given me meditation exercises to further help control my mind but it all comes back after I finish meditating.   


I study mental health a lot as I'm very interested in the social work field so I have come to find out a lot the struggles we face in our daily lives but yet I cant take my own advice because so many of my issues lie buried deep inside my unconscious mind. Something so big and so dark lives their, It is intelligent and it often hides itself and ruins my communication when I try to get help for it. I can believe that this matter has even gone as far as to becoming spiritual. I can believe that I'm haunted by a dark spirit that is planting the thoughts into my head rather than it being my own thoughts.  


 I'm open to exploring treatments on a spiritual level and treatments that work heavily with the unconscious mind. If you can relate, what have you done? ",31Jan2019,1

94,"So I'm 17 and I've been rejected from further therapy (therapist shortages; thanks Ireland's mental health department for those cuts) so I can't go to therapy as I'm not deemed as ""bad enough"" I.e. I'm not about to kill/harm myself so there's no room for me, even though I have chronic stress, anxiety and depression. 

Furthermore, my parents refuse to acknowledge anything is really wrong with me as they're of the mindset of ""there's no reason for you to be sad/stressed/ youre making it up"" etc as I'm sure many of you have heard before. So I can't talk to them about what I'm going through as most of the time when I feel bad it's because of them or they make it worse. A previous therapist suggested medicating me and my mother wouldn't allow it and as I'm under the age of signing for myself I couldn't get it.

I'd like to talk to my friends but unfortunately when I do it becomes an unhealthy and toxic situation where they get upset over what I'm talking about and I end up relying on them and taking my bad mood out on them. My girlfriend is really sensitive to it and again I turned it toxic by almost using her as a therapist unintentionally and she got the brunt of my bad moods. We've had discussions that she can't be my therapist anymore and I completely understand it was unfair so I've stopped telling her most of the stuff I go through.

I do frequently try self care and self soothing or whatever and it works but only to a minor degree. I tried bullet journaling and i do regular exercise which do help but not enough. 

So I have nowhere to go. Anytime I talk to my parents, they call me a pity party and tell me to suck it up, friends and partners I hurt. So where can I go?? I'm too poor to afford any online therapy which I would be happy to use and any free forms I've found aren't very good. So I feel trapped. Is there anything I can actually do or should I just grin and bear it?? Cause I feel like I'm going to explode as I'm in a very stressful exam year (leaving cert) and it's severely impacting my grades. I'm open to anything honestly because I don't see any options currently. Thanks for reading if you do, I'm just in a bad place right now.

Tl;dr: I'm a teen with shitty parents and I'm in a bad place with no one to talk to and no access to any form of therapy. Is there anything that I can do?? Thanks :)",31Jan2019,1
95,"I am at a very confusing time at the moment and my anxiety levels have gone up which has caused me to start thinking everything I do. 

I moved countries a bit over a year ago and got a full time job which I dislike because of the company's policies, I feel like they do not suit my own values and have started to think about quitting and moving back home. This is making me extremely scared as I left for a lot of reasons. However, while being back for Christmas I felt as if things had changed and I might feel like I fit in but now being back I feel the opposite. 

My relationship with my family had always been awful until I moved countries. My dad has anger management issues so I was beaten up a lot as a kid if he didn't have weed or if we did not obey the rules my parents had set. My mom is very judging and would rather blame you than take your side. Due to this I was a very shy and quiet as a kid which led to me getting bullied my whole life by my parents and the kids in my class, never had friends. I did tell my parents but they would say I am a liar and just trying to get their attention or that it was just my own fault for being who I am.

My mom would also call me fat and lazy, say I would never get a job and that I look like I use drugs everyday. This went on for years and ruined my self-confidence. They have now said they are proud of me but I am scared of disappointing them by moving back. 

When I turned 12 I would spend all my free time in my bed as I had no friends to hang out and was scared of people, started cutting couple years later. Parents found out and said I am an idiot. This went on until I was 17 and started seeing a psychiatrist to which they did not react well as my parents didn't think depression is real and that going to see someone about this is crazy. 

During this time I also had a boyfriend who helped me with a lot of my issues and I started taking medication for depression, massive thank you for my him and the meds as I was able to attend school and felt better. However I broke up with my bf a year and a half later and stopped meds about a year after that due to me moving. 

Thanks to my family and all the bullying in school I dislike everything about myself and am scared of people as I feel they will hit me or yell at me if I say something wrong. I am also scared of eating as I feel like I will gain weight, I am normal weight atm after losing 20 kilos but I have feel it is not enough. I just don't want to worry people... I am scared of complementing myself as I feel like this is very selfish and even thinking to myself ""I look good today"" feels inappropriate and extremely selfish. 

I have noticed this all is affecting my relationships and social life way too much as I tend to feel like there is no point because people will hate me anyway or that they dislike and I need to constantly ask them what they are thinking about and if they like me. I hate doing this as I know how annoying it is, I find it annoying myself. 

I also have a lot of issues with my sexual life as I have been raped twice in my life and got sexually abused online as a teenager for 5 years. 

I made a mistake of sending nudes with my picture on them to a guy online after he told me he likes me. To a bullied 13 year old who had no one else that was a thread to hang on to and I would do anything he asked me to. I have no clue who he actually was or where he is from and hate myself for doing this. I blame myself all the time. I think he shared them to other people on the app as I started getting messages from random guys asking me to send them pictures and videos. At first I refused but after they started threatening me saying they know where I live and that they will come and kill my family I gave in and did what I was asked. Never told my parents as they would have just blamed me and I already knew it was completely my fault. Eventually this led to them asking me to do stuff live on a webcam through Skype to which I agreed. My ex taught me stay calm on these instances and just block them, I would call him every time this happened and he would talk to me until I calmed down. 

This has given me a lot of problems with sleeping, especially alone as I feel that I am not safe and need someone next to me. This is still a problem and I cannot get past it, smoked weed for a while but it gave me more anxiety and almost made me unable to leave the house so I stopped. I also feel that saying no to people asking to have sex is rude and will force myself to sleep with someone if I have to. 

I feel numb and am unsure of how I feel most of the time. I don't know if I am happy or if I am just faking it due to doing so for a long time in the past. I am tired and feel as if I am the worst person alive and sometimes think I should have just ended it when I was 12 to save myself from all this. People keep saying it will get better but I have tried my best and still feel this way. Is there something wrong with me, I feel like I am crazy for feeling all this. 

I am sorry for ranting, I just had to open up about this as I am too scared to pick up the phone and call those helplines as phone calls give me anxiety and because of living in a foreign country I don't know how to get help, tried googling it earlier. I also never told my psychiatrist about the online things and got raped after stopping to see her so I have never gone to anyone about these issues. 

I also want to apologize if this all seems like it is everywhere but this is how it phrased in my head. Thank you for reading and sorry again for opening up like this.",31Jan2019,1

I’m on tons of medication and some for depression and anxiety but nothing works. It never works. When I try to see a therapist it always ends in a screaming match. I don’t have any privacy with my psychiatrist because my parents insist on being in the room with me even though I’m 18.

101,"Hello there,

I've moved out from my dysfunctional family some months ago and am now in a new city starting over. It's stressful. A family is letting me stay in their attic until I find a flat, but they are dysfunctional too. I can't find a place of my own, I feel like a burden. On top of that I am really lonely and too anxious to make friends in college. I talk to people every day, but it's been three months and I wouldn't call anyone my friend, really. I realized that my broken home is still impacting me. I don't know who I am, now that they aren't forcing me to be someone I'm not anymore. Especially over the last few weeks the sky feels like crashing down on me.

My last therapist said I had PTSD, but I'm not so sure. I have surreal dreams of meeting myself in alternate versions, I can't stop thinking about all the things I ever failed at, I constantly feel the urge to scratch the skin of my back and my scalp as well as ears are itchy from the inside. Sometimes I think of perforating my skin, but I have never done that and mentioning it feels pathetic. I also am extremely anxious and detached. I want to connect to people, but I hate talking and I feel like I have nothing to say. Sometimes I think I've already had or heard every conversation ever in the world. 

I think I might be at the turning point of a manic phase. I've experienced one before, but I was never diagnosed. I seem like a very normal quiet person from outside, but I'm really lost. While looking out of the window on the metro today I saw a crisis center. It's 6 minutes away from my home and I really feel like talking to someone. I just don't know what to say. And I don't think I'm having a crisis. At least not more of a crisis than usually. I'm a little scared of going there and not being able to say anything. My last therapist assumed I was ok when I didn't have anything specific to talk about and actually declared my treatment successful when it wasn't. I've made an appointment with a new counselor in April 2019. But I think I might have lost the will to talk to someone completely until then. 

Should I just go to the centre now? I don't feel like it's enough of a crisis. Even writing this makes me feel like a pity party.",31Jan2019,1

103,"Im 22 yr old, Male. Everytime anything in my life reaches a point of hardship or challenge, whether its a hobby, school, work, etc, I feel terrible. I start thinking about how bad life is, and how I'm a pathetic person that deserves to suffer. I am too sensitive and fragile that even the littlest problem or struggle I face makes me consider suicide, and go into my room and sleep away the rest of the day. I've been like this for as long as I can remember, and I've seen over 9 different therapists and an IOP program. I try to remember that this is all just a part of life, and its inevitable, but I just can't face it. Anytime I do face it, I end up getting no where, and need to rely on others to handle it for me. 

My mom is unfortunately the same way, and I basically inherited this from her. I honestly feel like I would be better off dead, no more pain, no more suffering.

Mainly because I don't want to ask again but also because I really feel like a fucking idiot because I need someone to help me.

105,"On mobile but feeling compelled to write this so bear with me.

This is could be completely anecdotal and I'm just speaking from experience.

I've been treated for GAD and panic disorder for four years. Last summer I started experiencing severe stress symptoms despite my medication being generally effective for the past few years. 

I was having sleep jerks, random palpitations, unexplained moods, sweating more than usual, vertigo, and constipation. 

I thought something was seriously wrong with my body so I saw a gastroenterologist, a dietician, an ENT, my psychiatrist and my neurologist. 

My tests were fine. They all advised that I reduce stress. My psychiatrist and I spent the majority of our time together discussing how psychiatric medications, although very effective for most lifestyles, have a hard time competing with lots of stress hormones running around in the body.

Im in my late twenties, trying to advance my career and generally function at a high level. I figured it was time to get critical about the stressors in my life.

The two major things that stuck out within the first few days were: realising that putting off responsibilities made me more anxious and stressed (this was fairly easy to fix with a little discapline) and video games not only caused me to be more tense and moody depending on the game but triggered stress responses while I was playing them!

Playing games my whole life I figured it was a form of stress relief so analysing how I felt was difficult. 

I cut out intense games right away, anything that had competitive online multiplayer. I felt pretty good most evenings after that. It made sense, not being tense or even upset every ten minutes should improve my well being. 

Then I started gauging how I felt when playing challenging single player games. Things like Dark Souls, DOOM, some of Breath of the Wild. This was interesting for me. If I had a long day at work and came home to play one of these games I typically wasn't too thrilled afterward. I would get frustrated easily at the game mechanics, beat myself up for not doing something correctly, and sometimes have weird outbursts as if I'd actually made a huge IRL mistake like a fender bender except this wasn't real life and my reaction was completely inappropriate.

If I played these games on a chill Saturday morning at home I noticed the first hour or two we're typically enjoyable. I'd find humors in mishaps, generally play the game better, and taking time to actually enjoy the game world and what not. But after a while I'd notice stress responses bubbling up, neck and chest tension and sweaty palms mostly. I didn't like how I felt if I played for extended periods of time either.

So at this point I felt pretty defeated and a little upset at myself for doing this for years and not noticing my body (almost literally) shitting the bed from stress hormones. I decided to go a couple weeks without any video games.

Within the first couple days I noticed I had more drive and energy to accomplish immediate responsibilities and chores, things I'd be frustrated to handle after a match of ranked Overwatch. I would do things like come home from work and start tidying up for when my girlfriend got home so we could just enjoy the evening together. 

However, the wanting of playing a game came around eventually. I figured the healthy thing to do was trying to enjoy playing a game for little while rather than avoiding it because I was scared of stress. Fast forward another few weeks and my usage is typically an 1-2 hour session every few days. And I only play when I really feel like it, I don't mindlessly turn on my PC or Switch just cause I'm bored.

This feels much more balanced. When I play a game it feels like it did when I was a kid. It's exciting and fun, not stressful.

I'm going to add here that I've made other lifestyles improvements with the extra time I have from cutting out a lot of gaming time. I've been exercising more, cooking for myself more, going to bed earlier, handling chores in a timelier manner. Obviously these have made a huge impact on my mental health as well but I still think it started with tapering something that was unhealthy, too much games.

Going to end this with the disclaimer that this might not have as big of an impact with your mental wellbeing but it did for me so I thought I'd share my experience.

Thanks for reading.",31Jan2019,1
106,"I’ve been diagnosed with what’s called Dependent Personality Disorder (or DPD for short). Here is the story.

All my life I’ve always felt like I couldn’t be alone. Since I was 17 I haven’t been without a girlfriend for more than three months. I just can’t stand being by myself, I like to have a romantic partner around literally 24/7, it makes me less anxious.

I also have never been assertive. I’ve always been really friendly and try to make friends with anyone I come across. I’ve also wanted to make a connection with every girl I saw. I am obsessed with the feeling of being loved and wanted. I needed constant approval from everyone.

I always placed everyone else’s need above my own, so if I needed to go to work but you needed to borrow my car to go to the park, I would call out of work to make you happy. I also love it when people make decisions for me. Tell me what to wear. What to eat. What to drink.

When I get a criticism, I take it REALLY hard. If someone says I’m stupid or anything like that, it makes me extremely sad. Their validation means a whole lot to me.

When I’m alone, it is he most miserable feeling of my life. I constantly crave a connection and a friend that I can just have on the phone, I don’t even need to talk to them. Just having someone there is comforting.

Over the years it’s gotten a lot worse. I didn’t really think about it or think it’s a problem until just recently.

I recently went through a breakup after we dated for 7 months. This is the first girl I’ve ever actually feel like I’ve felt in love with them. Others I’ve dated for 2-3 years each and I never felt like I’ve actually loved them, I just kept them around hoping I would just magically wake up one day and be madly in love with them.

My ex broke up with me on my birthday in October, and I begged and begged her to come back, and we got back together a few days later. She broke up with me again on Christmas, this time blocking me on everything and dating a new guy the same day, even though we spent Christmas together with her family.

I call her every day to hear her voicemail. I text her all the time even though she doesn’t get them because I’m blocked. I’ve realized it isn’t even her that I’m missing, it’s just contact with a girl. I’ve been really anxious since we broke up and it’s driving me insane. I’ve stopped eating and sleeping and I attempted suicide about 3 weeks ago. I wouldn’t wish this hell on anyone. I wish there were others like me.

TL;DR I suffer from DPD and it’s been extremely rough.",31Jan2019,1
107,"I am really hoping someone can give me some advice! I have never suffered with either ocd or obstructive thoughts in my life until the last 2 weeks (I'm 22). I have recently been trying to treat my pcos and hormonal acne myself by taking a combination of saw palmetto, myo-inositil, vit D, zinc &amp; vit C. While doing nothing for my skin I started to feel very anxious about a month into this combo of vitamins. (I have suffrred from anixity and depression in my teenage years but have been totally okay since about 18) Then came the obstructive thoughts! They came slow like little worrys, then I started imagining horrible things that little brought me to tears even more so because I have a 18month year old daughter and alot of the thoughts were things happening to her. The more I had the thoughts the more anxious and upset I was getting so I totally stopped everything. I was okay for a few weeks and believe it was the saw palmetto that was causing the obstructive thoughts.

Is it possible this combo of vitamins has gave me OCD for life?

108,"Hello everyone, I'm 19, and I'm very confused about myself and why I do the stuff I do. I feel like I fake everything all the time and I need someone to help me understand where my behaviour is coming from.

 When I was 16, I started cutting and trying to lose weight in unhealthy ways. Looking back at it, I was never seriously  mentally ill. I think I did that kind of stuff just for the ""aesthetic"" of the sad pretty girl. Cutting wasn't an obsession, I did it when I wanted to and I was able to control myself.. same with the ""eating disorder"". I tried to purge one or two times but I couldn't, and I never tried again.. but in my mind I was ""bulimic"" which was just not true. 

However, I had really low self esteem and my mother noticed it, so she took me to a psychologist. This to me felt like I had accomplished something, I was so happy and relieved than my parents noticed me! I felt validated, even if I knew I wasn't going to get a diagnosis (because I wasn't really sick!).

 The psychologist was an horrible match for me and didn't help me at all. Every session I just lied and lied, trying to say what she wanted me to hear. But after my mother took me there and actually noticed me, I stopped cutting and restricting.. I think it was because I was doing it just for the attention, and after I got that I didn't need to do these kind of behaviours anymore.

After one year and an half, I don't regret any of the stuff I did. Actually, I'm happy I used to cut. Sometimes I use this as an excuse to make people pity me (it's horrible I know). For example, with my ex girlfriend: she was depressed and self centred. I wanted to break up. I used the excuse of my ""fragile emotional state"" and said she effected me negativity because of my past. I even showed her the cuts. Honestly, it was an excuse, I was just annoyed with her..  

Last month, I don't know why, I started restricting again, and now that I don't live with my parents anymore, I can restrict harder. I'm actually in a 48 hour fast right now. But even as I type this, I just can't help feeling like a fake attention-whore. I know that in two weeks I will start again to eat normally, so why am I doing all this? Why am I faking an ED, which is a really serious illness that can kill people? I am so disappointed in myself. 

This was probably a confused rambling. I'm sorry. I'm just very very confused...

111,"I have never dealt with mental illness before, certainly not on this level. My SO and I have been together more than a year and pretty early on he told me about his severely dysfunctional and abusive childhood. He was in therapy and on a grocery list of medications for anxiety, depression, and ocd among other things but really kept a lot of his symptoms under wraps and seemed to be doing well. He was always very open about communicating with me when I asked about meds and side effects any time they seemed to be concerning. 

Things seemed good earlier this week when he suddenly began behaving oddly, almost like a sleepwalker. He was incoherent and slurring his words, not remembering things and unable to distinguish dreams/hallucinations from reality. When he finally came out of it and started making sense what we pieced together was terrifying and we still have no clue what caused it. After an emergency visit to his therapist, he decided to check himself into an inpatient treatment center. I was shocked, and have not stopped crying since then (I rarely cry). I have so many questions:

\- What is going to happen to him and will he be okay?

\-What DID happen to him to cause this?

\-Why didn't I notice the warning signs/get help for him sooner?

\-How can I continue to support him without getting completely overwhelmed myself?

I am the stable, strong person a lot of people depend on and I feel like I failed him in a way. I also miss him, worry for our future, and don't know what to do next. I made an appointment with a therapist for myself because I don't feel right talking to friends or family about this (with respect to his privacy). I am trying to stay calm and think of this as a good thing, a way he can get evaluated and be in a safe place and get better. But do people get better?

114,"Hi all,

So, recently I've another  attempt at seeking help from a mental health professional and was diagnosed with depression (which I've already been diagnosed with three years ago, so it wasn't surprising as I didn't get much better) and histrionic personality disorder. 

 I didn't really know what HPD was, so I looked it up online after the session, and I was kinda surprised. I've been extremely shy and introverted my whole life, people actually make fun of how quiet I am. I also have no sexual experience at the age of 24, and I begin to suspect I might be asexual. I also tend to overthink and overanalyze things too much, and I have strong suicidal and self-harm tendencies.

I'm reading all these stories when learning their diagnosis helps people understand their own behavior and experiences, but in my case it's something completely opposite.  

Should I maybe consult with another doctor for a second opinion?

117,"Hello, I am not sure exactly what I am going to say in this post, but I am looking for some help on how to help a friend. I am sorry if this post becomes very long. He was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and has said to me and our friends that his psychiatrist believes he is in a state of mania. This all happened sort of fast last year and he was forced to take a semester off of school. Now that he is back in school, he has been acting very strange and I am not sure how to confront him about it. He talks to himself nearly constantly, sometimes switching voices and asking and answering questions to himself. It is hard to tell whether he is talking to me or himself, and when I ask him if he would stop talking to himself, he either says there is nothing wrong with it and keeps doing it (could be for up to 10 minutes straight before he addresses me again) or ignores me entirely. I also have reason to believe that he stopped taking his meds. Before he was diagnosed with bipolar, he was on meds for anxiety and suddenly stopped taking them altogether because he thought he felt better. This was when he was removed from school by his parents and his behavior started and eventually he was diagnosed with bipolar. Now, I asked him how he thought his new meds were working and if he was taking them and he would not give me a straight answer. These are just two of my biggest concerns among some other small ones, but this is as much as I can post right now. 
If there is any advice on how to deal with him talking and rambling to himself or to make sure he is taking his meds please let me know. ",31Jan2019,1
118,"In six months I’ll be 21. I made it. I made it your guys. I fucking made it. 

I have been struggling with bipolar disorder II for all of my life, but had only been diagnosed with it two years ago. Until about eight months ago, I was in and out of hospital. I had to drop my last academic term because my grades were so beyond fucked that I couldn’t get them back up. I took the Fall off too because I definitely was not going to make it count if I came back. I told all my friends that it was financial issues. 

When I was sixteen I set a reminder to kill myself on my twentieth birthday. When that reminder popped up last year over the summer, I deleted it without hesitation. 

I’m happy. I’m finally finally happy. Is life perfect? No. But I’m WORKING on it. I’m friends with people who make me feel like I’m a worthwhile person. I don’t have a boyfriend but I do have someone who I really enjoy the company of right now. I have parents who love me and a cat back home who misses me and I love being alive. I love being fucking alive. 

My life was hell that I could not deal with. I still have those demons and they still keep me up at night. But I have goals that shout louder in my head.

I am reading a lot about the BetterHelp controversy lately and I have a question concerning the service itself and the way it works: would you like to use a platform like it if it wouldn't be run by non tested ""experts"" and only gave your data to licensed therapists you were referred to by the site and agree to meet?",31Jan2019,1
124,On nearly a daily basis I have a longing to run away. Not permanently. I love my life. I have a great job (not a passion but it takes care of life) and an amazing family. Yet I cannot shake this urge to leave on my own for awhile. I married young - my high school sweetheart. We started dating freshman year and have been together for nearly nine years now. He really is amazing. His sixteen year old sister moved in with us recently and she's great too. I am living with bipolar depression. I've contemplated medication on a regular basis however have never muscled the courage to go through with taking it. I don't necessarily feel suicidal as much as I just want to leave everything and everyone behind. Part of me really doesn't mean that but another part of me craves solitude. Am I a bad person? I have no intention of leaving. No plan. But I can't shake the urge to not go home after work. To get in my car and just drive somewhere until I decide it's time to go home. Is this normal? Is this serious?,31Jan2019,1

126,"I am experiencing a weird state of mind. I am 45 years old man with an okay job and a good family.  While my job is okay, I don't see any meaningful growth here, so I need to move on.  I have been trying to change this job for about two years but I haven't had any luck. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I need to keep working on my skills and applying for jobs until I get another job and I have earmarked certain things I need to do. But my mind just doesn't want to do it; it keeps on finding excuses to avoid doing what I should be doing.  There is no motivation. As a result, I feel guilty at the end of the day that I have wasted another day without doing anything to achieve my goals. But that guilt goes away after a few hours and I am back to my old ways.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, my mind is generally calm ( I meditate) and I am happy with my family relations.  I work out regularly and read a lot of books.

How do I get out of this state of lethargy?

127,"So this is kind of weird and the title doesn't perfectly describe what I'm dealing with. It's not that I can't stop thinking about things that happened or that I'm dogged by mistakes I've made, things like that. Sure, I overthink some decisions I've made, but that's a matter of mindset, I'd say. The ""issue"" I'm talking about consists more of flashes of extremely detailed recall of events in the past, some recent, some not so recent. These are so detailed that I feel like I could pretty much reconstruct my entire life day by day if I wanted to. For instance, I recently went on an extended trip abroad, and on occasion I will get these flashbacks to it where I feel like I recall almost everything, the people on the street around me, the way the road turned, how the food tasted at one specific meal. These flashbacks are in an odd way kind of debilitating because they're so detailed they're all I can think about and they take genuine energy to snap out of. I mean, it is kinda cool to be able to see what my mind can reconstruct, but recently it's been getting to the point of interfering with my work, daily life, etc.....

128,I can’t explain why I’m going through what I’m going through but I’ve been trying with all of the strength inside of me to stay strong for years now. The pain I have suffered has been too much for me it’s been consistent for years now. For years I’ve been breaking down in pain feeling like I can’t do this anymore I can’t live this life anymore. It would be so relieving to think that I could leave this world and be free from the pain and suffering but no matter how much this hell im in hurts there’s no way out. I have a beautiful daughter that I could never leave. I could never leave her I love her so much she means everything to me. I’m so tired of suffering. I don’t want to live my life anymore.

130,My abusive and alcoholic father passed away last month. I hated him. We haven't been in contact for years. I didn't cry over him and I didn't feel anything but everything has been extra hard for me lately. I recently relocated to a foreign country where I don't know if I can get help in. I have no one around me to talk to. All my friends and family are in another continent. I'm being very high functioning because I just started a new job and I can't let my mental health damage that but putting up a strong front is draining the life out of me. I'm spiraling. I have some suicidal tendencies which I haven't had since I was a teen. I haven't been eating right. Haven't been sleeping well.  And I constantly feel like I have to work twice or thrice as hard to attain the things that others get so easily. Things that were handed to them on a silver platter that I have to fight tooth and nail to get even a fraction of. I'm beginning to think if it's all worth it. If anything is. Everything I desire is years away from my grasp. I'm having massive tidal waves of sadness and anxiety wash over me every now and then throughout the day. You know how they say life is like a rollercoaster and no matter how low you get you're bound to get up again? Mine feels like it's been going down for years with no sign of going up anytime soon. I'm not exactly a weak person. I have lived through the shits and came out the other side fine. But I just feel like I lost it. Like this was the tipping point. The hair that broke the camel's back or what have you. What if it never gets better? What if I never achieve the things I want in life? What if I'm still not happy even when I do? Coming here was supposed to be a blank slate and a fresh start and a stepping stone for me to reach my goals. But this blank page just feels more and more tainted. I need to get out. I don't know how long I can do this before I crack. But I'm in no position to crack. I don't have that luxury. I don't have the luxury to have feelings right now. I don't know anything,31Jan2019,1
131,"I don't know how to begin this post so I'll just take it from the start.

In 2012 I started suffering from anxiety and panic attacks. I got help and 6 months later I was back on my feet. The anxiety wasn't gone but I had learned how to cope with it and it no longer controlled my life as it had done before. Or so I thought.  
I started having suicidal thoughts way more often and intensely and I started drinking a lot. I tried to party my sadness away and I surrounded myself with like-minded people. Everything started spiraling out of control. I woke up in the hospital after a night of partying and I decided to really try to take control of my life again. I met a girl who became my girlfriend, everything was going better, she moved in with me, I finished school and I got a job.  
Me and her were happy together and life was pretty good for the next 3 years. But I started to feel like shit again and I went back to drinking and partying. Nothing made me happy. I used to travel a lot to compete in e-sport tournaments, my biggest passion in life, but I didn't care about that at all anymore. It all happened so fast, it was like someone flipped a switch. I changed a lot, me and my girlfriend would fight all the time and I didn't help out around the house. I would always be too hungover to be around and I was never happy. She broke up with me and moved out, breaking my heart completely. I really loved her (still do) very, very much. Life became unbearable. I would drink every day after work, alone. Again, 6 months later I decided to get my shit together and I started to look into studying in another town. Get away from the all the old memories, start fresh and meet new people. I applied for a school and I actually got in! I was very happy for a few days, but from april - august I don't really remember much. In august I moved in to a dorm, I started studying, got a part time job as a DJ and made a lot of new friends. But I couldn't shake the feeling of dread.

I've been living here for 6 months now. I feel like I have done everything I can to become happy again. I've been dating a lot but I am completely unable to feel anything for the women I meet. It's just temporary company and I've ended up hurting a lot of people which makes me feel like shit. I can no longer sleep at night. I get panic attacks again. I worry about everything. I'm falling behind in school because I'm always exhausted. When I drink I don't worry, but obviously the next day the anxiety is waaay worse. I've tried to find things to do that are productive and healthy to occupy my mind but it feels like I've lost the ability to socialize sober. I've been trying to get back in to the e-sport I used to play, but I get bored within minutes. I enjoy going to quiz nights at the pub but I find it hard to be sober unless my company is also sober, which they never are. Everything has gotten out of control. I procrastinate everything. I have no energy to function as a responsible adult anymore.

The past is looping inside my head 24/7, and when I try to imagine my future I see nothing. I fake laugh when I'm with friends, because I feel empty inside. I am paranoid all the time. If I hear a car outside my hearts starts beating really fast. If someone looks at me on the bus I feel like they are about to expose me. I don't trust people anymore, I don't talk to my family anymore. I'm always worried about the police coming to arrest me or that someone is going to expose me. I delete my facebook account every other week. I hide from my dorm mates. I don't know what I'm afraid of, I have nothing to hide or expose but the feeling is so strong that I can't control it.

I can't even cry anymore, I can't feel anything but worries.

Anti-depressants have not helped. I also stopped taking them because I became convinced that they were turning me bald, again without any reasonable evidence.

What do I do? What is this?",31Jan2019,1

I sometimes feel like nothing will ever change and that therapy and medication won’t make me a different person, especially since I’ve always been this way. Even if I had a job I doubt it would be better then a another high stress-low paying job that most people work because they aren’t smart/talented enough to finish college or just don’t live in an area that offers better. My therapist ask how I’m doing and don’t know how to respond. I’m still miserable! I’m still just stuck in my room playing video games all day! What exactly did you expect to change?! They talk as if the medication is supposed to transform me into this awesome person that I never was to begin with. How can therapy and medication work if you’re Forever stuck in a bad situation?

136,"I’m not sure if this is the place to post this but I’m starting to feel like this is consuming and ruining my life. 

So for the past couple months if not years I’ve had this really weird thing where I feel like there are two different sides of me. I have a nice and happy side that is increasingly beginning to feel like a fake persona or facade that I have in public which is alright. However the other side of me scares me, when I was younger it used to just be when I was angry, I would turn into a aggressive monster and fight people almost as if a switch flipped in my brain and I would go off on people in some cases straight up attacking them. However now it feels like it has gotten worse, instead of attacking others it gives me really dark thoughts about things that make me disgusted I can even think things like that. I have found that when I’m in this “side” of me I come across as callous, which no emotion whatsoever and sometimes feel like a psychopath. Not caring about others even those close to me and just turning all care and emotions off like a faucet. I try me best to control it and only show my “good” side in public but now when compounded with the stress of my life I find it increasingly hard and I live in fear because when that switch flips I can completely destroy the relationship that I have with someone, driving away friends or offending family members. I have tried various tests online but I have never got any formal ones because I fear that I will worry my parents (I’m 16) and I fear the results I may get back. When I tested myself online I showed multiple markers for high functioning autism as well as psychopathy, sociopathy and borderline personality disorder. I know this probably just sounds stupid but that I can use this is just a place for me to vent about my fears and see if maybe anyone can come up with ways for me to overcome or at least suppress into submission my darker side before it ruins my life in a way that a apology won’t fix.
