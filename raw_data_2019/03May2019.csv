0,"Hi. I've created this account specifically to ask for some advice. My very close friend lives across the US from me, in South Carolina, and has had many awful experiences with medical personnel there. A year and a half ago she was committed by her family to her local institution, but all they did was hold her for two weeks, change one of her medications, and let her go. She was far worse for wear afterwards, more depressed than before but terrified of trying anything. Recently she's been in a bad place again, to the point where I almost called her local police on her before something else intervened first because she was on her way to jump off a bridge. She lives in Gaffney, her family is dirt poor, she has an inherent distrust of hospitals/doctors and a HATRED for cops, and I don't know what else I can do.   


I'm really scared I'm going to lose her, and if it comes down to it, I will call her police. Better alive and upset than dead. That being said, I don't know of any alternatives that we could use first to prevent that from happening. She struggles with so many different things that I wouldn't even be sure of what to say were I to call. I've tried looking up alternative resources in her area, but all of them either seem god awful or way too expensive for them to possibly afford. What can I do to help her?",03May2019,1
1,"To make a disclaimer, I'm not asking for a professional diagnosis and am aware that I should seek professional help- I'm more so asking if my behavior is emotionally abnormal (also I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression disorders, so my greivances with my emotional state could be due to just that):

I hate weddings, I hate the dancing, the crying and the fun people are having seems superficial to me and makes me extremely uncomfortable.
But, if I went to a ballet, I would find it beautiful and would become very emotional (even to the verge of tears).
When a friend is trying to vent about something they deeply feel about, again, I feel so emotionally unvailable and unable to respond in an empathetic manner (though I try)
But if I see a group of flowers that look and smell appealing, I'll emotionally respond.
It's almost as if I can respond emotionally to things that aren't necessarily sentient as apposed to things that are. In fact sometimes I genuinely dislike it. I understand things like humor, social ques, and internally understand such things as intimacy as well, but outwardly, even with my close friends I find it hard to express love, but when they are gone for long periods of time I miss them very very deeply. It just seems very strange. It's like in the present moment I can almost be sociopathic, but internally and after the fact, I am anything but. If you have any opinions I would be very grateful. Thank you!",03May2019,1
2,"I was in English this afternoon. The desks are put together in rows. I sometimes talk to my seatmate. I dont contribute to class discussion though. I'm nervous to do that. 

We were talking a lot about many different topics ranging from medicine to school to memory loss. I like talking to this person. It's nice. I do not talk to many people. Anyways one of the topics they brought up today was mental illness. They aren't very educated about it. They think that people with mental illness are violent. They also think they are scary. They also believe that most mental illnesses are from external stuff. I didnt know what to say back to them. I didnt say anything to them. We switched the topic. I should have educated them but I didnt want to out myself or make them think I was weird. What should I do the next time the topic is this?",03May2019,1
3,"I always thought I was pretty normal. I was never really a ""happy"" person, but I generally got on with things without too much trouble.

People in the past (primarily family members) have told me that I ""need help"". I always figured since I was still just getting on with life they were just being overdramatic.

Lately however (and I think it's been going on for a long time, but I only just figured it out) I just can't handle silence. Even for a few minutes. 

If I'm not constantly distracting myself with something (TV, movies, YouTube, work, making this post, etc) I just start... Thinking. It's never anything good, always along the lines of thinking about mistakes I've made, or how I hate my job (I don't think I really do, but that's where my mind goes), or about how I can't ever imagine a future where I'm actually happy, or why even bother with life any more. 

Right now, I honestly can't remember the last time I was genuinely happy with life. Not even sure what I'm supposed to be aiming for.

Now I'm still just getting on with things. Still going to work, still getting by at college, but surely this can't be how everyone feels? I can't imagine this is normal. I'm always tired, I can't sleep properly because trying to let myself drift off just end up with more thinking, and keeping my brain otherwise occupied makes it difficult to sleep.

I don't know what I'm trying to get out of writing this, maybe just another few minutes of distraction.

Maybe, if anyone else has been like this, tell me it gets better?",03May2019,2

5,I’m going to prom with a guy my friend set me up with(to just go to prom with each other) and we eventually got to know each other kinda  and he seemed kinda down when we were getting prom tickets I asked him what was wrong later and he said he had a lot on his mind and that he was nervous to go to prom with me. He wouldn’t tell me why. Then he said later on I just want you to know I really want to go to prom with you and that’s why I’m nervous.

8,"I had to go to the special ed room to do math practice today. I'm not in math this semester. I'm behind in my abilities though. 

I have a hard time doing word problems and remembering how to do stuff. Today was good though. I feel a bit more confident. I got guided through the problems when I was doing them. I felt a bit frustrated because of repetition and not getting it. I sort of felt embarrassed. 

I failed math last semester. It was hard and my teacher didnt like me or understand that I need extra time. They sort of didnt think about my IEP. They sent me out when I was on my phone, so that I could get extra help. 

I also have issues with processing what people say or what I read. One of my teachers used to call on me all the time. I would blush and it would take me 5 minutes to respond. I would also shake and blush when I had to read outloud. I can write really well and read well but reading outloud is hard. I jumble up words. I also do that when I speak. I have to rehearse  what I say before I say it. I sometimes dont use full sentences when talking. People comment on it. I feel like my brain and mouth dont work together properly. 


I also take a long time to learn certain things. People get mad at me. It makes me feel like I am unemployable because I would take too long to go through training. I have been in the special ed system since I was 7. Some people didn't believe I could complete high school. I'm almost done. I have one more year though. I have to retake math and work on improving other things.",03May2019,3

10,"I've been taking my sister's Klonopin/Clonazepam for the last few weeks. It feels like it's working for me but I'm also reliant on it,  and scared for when the bottle runs out. There's probably around 30 left. 

I'm don't think she uses them anymore because she has them stored away,  but I'm aware that it's still wrong. 

I can't get through the day without it because my own medication isn't cutting it. When I take it,  my anxiety calms down and don't feel like self harming anymore. It helps me get through work and school without feeling overwhelmed, and it helps me get a good nights sleep. 

 I'm seeing a psychiatrist this Saturday who will hopefully review my meds and prescribe what is needed. 

Should I be open and tell her about this?  I'm scared for her response but I also feel guilty. I would be annoyed if someone was taking from me.",03May2019,0

All my days feel like they sink into one of them, even the good ones are good because I get to be impulsive and not face problems from it.

14,"So, I live a fairly normal life. I'm doing online schooling because public school wasn't working out and for the first few weeks it's been good, I can keep up with the work and everything. The issue comes in when I try to do anything for fun or in my free time. I get done with school and have to do chores for my parents and it's ridiculous. I live in a house with six people (Mom, Step-Dad, Step-sis, Step-sis's GF, my sister, and myself) yet I'm the only one who does actual work around the house (I do pretty much everything except wash dishes and feed dogs) and I feel like no matter what happens it's always me pitching in, and I feel like it's taken a toll on every part of my life. I can't even listen to the music I like anymore, I feel like nothing makes me happy. Not to mention my household is full of tension around my household on my end. as soon as someone pulls up to the driveway I feel a sudden knot in my stomach. I love my mom and my whole family... well I did, but I don't want to see anyone lately. Not my aunts, not my uncles, nobody. I feel like my friends and family all resent me. I really wanna get out of this slump and get my life in order, but all I want to do is take a day off, and not be me for a day. I just wanna chill for one day, but every day it's the same routine and I feel like I'm in this pit and I'll never get out. I'm one person, but whenever anything, no matter how minuscule, I freak and I wanna hurt someone, or something, but not just anyone mostly my step-sister who I dislike because she gets everything she doesn't deserve, she doesn't deserve to live with us (she's over 18) she doesn;t deserve her job, she doesn't work hard, she doesn't work to move out (as you should at her age), none of it, yet she gets it all. I'm the hardest working person in the house and I get ridiculed for everything I do and it's not fair.

But, I have a breakdown nearly every day. I use to be severely emotionally and verbally abused daily. I'll be feeling great, then all the sudden when I'm alone, I'll disassociate and think of everything that's ever happened to me. I often imagine I'm talking to someone else, like my imaginary therapist, or a trusted teacher who I really like. I'll relive what's happened to me and express it to the imaginary people listening. It happens automatically, I dont force myself to imagine people there listening. 

Afterwards, I'll feel better, but I wont remember most of what I even talked about or thought about. What is this? I dont think it's PTSD. Is it just a way to purge built up feelings?

16,"Hi all. I have pretty severe ADHD and it brings about a lot of anxiety and severe depression. It makes my days pretty blue and I’m really starting to feel desperate to get out of this funk. When I took my prescribed Straterra, it treated these symptoms almost immediately... I’m ready to start taking it again *now* but getting in to restart my old prescription has already been a month-long process and could take at least a month longer until I can even see the right doctor for it.

My old prescription, which I have one refill and a 7 day supply of, is 60mg. What sort of effects would this have on my body? It’s been about a year since I stopped taking it. They aren’t expired and my refill is still honorable. I just want more information on what could happen if I jump back into a higher dosage without taking smaller steps to get from 0 to 60mg.

19,"Hello all, thanks for reading.

I'm not looking for a solution to this (unless someone knows one).  I'm just curious as to if anyone else has experienced this at all with SSRIs, as my doctor says it's the first she's ever heard of it, and she works on a campus and sees tons of students a day.

It's most common in the morning, right when I wake up.  For about 10 minutes, whenever I move my eyes, I can feel a sort of pressure around them that doesn't hurt, but is fairly uncomfortable and just a very strange and foreign feeling.  Even weirder, I can actually hear my eyes move during this time, too.  I would compare it to plugging your ears and moving your jaw.  That rumbling bass sound is the same sound I hear when I move my eyes, albeit a little less deep and a little louder.  As for the pressure feeling, the best way I can put it is that it feels like I have liquid all around the backside of my eyeballs and that the liquid moves when my eyes do.  I'm not sure if that's helpful at all.  Like I said, it's a very strange and foreign feeling.

I've gotten used to it by now and in the mornings, it usually dissipates when I get in the shower.  But occasionally this will happen during the day as well.  I'd say once every other day or so I'll have anywhere from 1 minute to several hours of this same sensation.  It's typically less intense than in the mornings but if I have a lot to do at work or I'm already agitated, it can be completely maddening.  Also, the one time I forgot my medication on a weekend road trip, I had this sensation for almost the entire weekend.  When I got home and took my meds and went to sleep, I felt fine the next day (aside from the daily morning sensation that I'd get anyway).

Lastly, someone may ask why I know this is being caused by the SSRIs and not something completely irrelevant.  I can't prove one way or the other, honestly.  But I've only been taking them for about 8 months, and I'd never experienced this before that.  It started happening the same month I started taking them.  So, I'm assuming it's the SSRIs but I'm open to any opinion.  Also if there's a better sub I should be posting this to that handles psychiatric medication or something, please let me know.

Thanks again!  Hope you're all motivated, content and hopeful.  I love each and every one of you and wish so badly that we weren't suffering.  But at least we've got each other. &lt;3",03May2019,1
20,"So I've been forcing myself to go out and socialize. I just moved to a new city and I don't have any friends (I used to have friends from high school, but I slowly phased myself out of their lives) and I can't seem to make any. I do have a co-worker who I enjoying hanging out with and I'll usually go do something with her every other weekend. My boyfriend goes out with friends about three times a week and I'll force myself to go with him to try to meet people, but usually I have to be drinking to relax enough to actually talk to other people... I do know this is unhealthy. I'm sure I have some form of social anxiety, but I don't have enough money to see a therapist so here I am!

I'm also obviously introverted, so I don't know where I can be more lenient with myself and where I need to improve. Here are the things I'm struggling with:

* I don't want to hang out with large groups of people. 4+ people stresses me out.
* I don't want to spend my time outside of work with people I don't like and pretend to like them. Example: There are a couple of people in my boyfriend's group of friends that make me feel like an outsider and I just don't want to be around that.
* How often is a healthy amount of socializing? 3 times a week? Once every two weeks?

It's always my mom or sister asking me to go with them somewhere or open my door or something of the nature. It never happens more than once in a row, so I usually don't respond if my mom or sister actually call me twice now. It kind of scares me, however it hasn't really impaired my life that much besides just terrifying me once every few days, because it could be the middle of the night in pitch black darkness, during a test, or just generally in the middle of the day. It's usually indecipherable if its really them or not.

23,hey guys im new to this sub just wanted to join in and share my life of stress. been living with mild autism/social withdrawal and sever depression/anxiety. when i was young it wasnt that bad until 13 became always upset at life dont know why. never had many friends due to my condition. during that aroung 2005 my mother became sick with breast cancer i didnt know much about the severity of this issue since i was young and dumb. eventually i matured all the way until now. during this process my mothers cancer got removed but years later around 2011 she became sick again this time in her liver. ( all these cancers were stage 4) and i was devastated since i saw my mother become depressed/sick mentally and physically and each day i saw she was deteriorating from healthy to more sick. god idk how i got this far becuz i felt like killing myself during those though times due to all this. since i was suffering immensely i decided to find religion which was Christianity and both me and my mom became christians. now i respect anyones religion and im not trying to bring anything here to preach im just telling story ( im not that type of extreme christian). all my life never knew god nor jesus until 1 day when i couldnt take it anymore i went to bed crying my butt of feeling this is the end and idk if its my brain or not but i actually had a dream of jesus and i know it sounds crazy since even myself was suprised i had that dream becuz i used to believe god didnt exist but not after what happened in my dream that he told me. he said some things that would happen in the future regarding my life which one of them was my mothers being cured of cancer. after the dream i decided to keep my life positive and continue on even though my moms cancer seemed uncurable. this past year and this year seemed my mother was getting somwhat better until i got bad news when i was with her in the hospital that she has stage 4 cancer cells in her stomach and that killed my faith completely. i literally became depressed and so so tired of life becuz i thought god was going to heal her not make her more sick. i blamed god recently for all this suffering god put in this world. i was at my lowest. right now im still here but barely making it mentally. my mom is still alive thank god at least but shes been suffering since 2005 until now for 15 years. idk how she made this far since most people like her 3 conditions die the first cancer since the chemo makes the person life very hard like hell. im just suprised my mom is still here. sometimes i ask why my mom and its hard.  is it possible for someone like my mom to live this long and what are the statistics since her case is like a miracle or something. i also need emotional support on what u guys think i should do now i feel alone since i have no one to talk to.,03May2019,1

Its there most of the time I think about him or any of that, but every so often it won’t be and I’ll be fine. Then came the crying.

27,"TLDR;  been off zoloft for a while.  tried again for two days, was very shaky for four days.  tried again again, same problem.  currently don't have a dr or psychiatrist to fix my meds, and would like advice on how to get new ones. are these symptoms going to go away and I need to keep going or should I stop trying with this med?

&amp;#x200B;

I've been off for a while.  It's really dumb, I get it, and I have no excuse other than I was in a very self sabotaging state of mind at the time.  I've never felt like this med did anything for me, but I guess it did something because now I can't enjoy anything. I get sex, and that barely leaves enough dopamine for me to be okay for the next half hour.

My biggest issue right now, is that I need to start taking my meds (zoloft + birth control) again, but I can't just pick up my zoloft and take it.  I will end up with nasty tremors for almost two-three entire days. It creates the physical symptoms of anxiety, from the heart racing and sinking cold feeling I personally get when I'm anxious without any actual anxiety attached to it.  Mentally, I feel fine, just really fucking annoyed because I can't function.  There are even times where I chatter my teeth.

28,"This'll be a long one, but I feel like I should just get all my thoughts out and in one place. For anyone who is curious total character count is just under 50% of the limit for this post. At the end the count is 19549/40000. So be warned.

So lets hop in with a little about me. I'm a male University student with a degree that will make me a lot of money when I graduate that I really enjoy. I'm a nerd, personality type falls into either ENFJ, ENFP, or ESFJ, and have a decent variety of interests. I have an emotionally abusive mom (hello mommy issues), a family history of depression/mental health problems(set up to fail genetically!), and come from a very religious background (Roman Catholic - I do not practice anymore). Currently in a mixed place with really poor emotional stability and can't rely on the people I was able to. I've dealt with depression/anxiety for years (12ish now). Had some intrusive thoughts about dying earlier and figured I needed to reach out in some way. Let's go on a journey of how I got here now.

&amp;nbsp;

So I was around 10 or so when I first remember being depressed. It might've started before that, but that year was when I first remember it affecting me, and boy did it. It was caused by a loss of friends mixed with heavy bullying. I almost killed myself that year. I thought about it frequently and wished I wasn't so scared of dying. I got made fun of by the guys because I was weird and nerdy and different. I didn't really have that much confidence going into that so I didn't handle being made fun of well at all. In the short term that was the most painful part - getting laughed at, belittled, and humiliated. What was overall worse in the long run was the way the girls treated me. I was treated like less than dirt just some examples - largely pretended I didn't exist, avoided me as if I was diseased, and acted like I was contagious with the plague or something. Between all this myself esteem was non existent for a long time, my hope for the future was and still is quite lacking, and I became quite closed off.  It got better a bit for the rest of middle school. I got back with my friends, but never quite as close as we were. Dealt with some physical possibly even sexual harassment from guys (there's a possibility that I'm Bi, but I don't think I'll ever explore it because I'm really uncomfortable around guys in that sense). Its been a long time so a lot of stuff is fuzzy from back then, but I know things briefly got better before graduation. We had some sort of retreat thing, and it felt like I had developed a connection with a lot of people guys and especially girls (this was more or less a first for me). We had a church group thing that I went to where it was especially nice. It was a brief reprieve, but everything seemed to settle back to where it was before pretty quickly. The church group thing was still nice, but outside of that it felt like no one really wanted to include me. A lot of people stopped going after awhile so it ended up leaving me cut off. I learned I really liked being connected with people and hugs were probably one of my favorite things. Left me even more miserable after because I felt more left out. But I graduated, moved on to high school, and got out of that portion of my life.

&amp;nbsp;

So I didn't really have a good base to start with heading into this chapter. I had big plans to make friends and fix it, but anxiety and a lack of self confidence had me end up sitting in the corner playing computers games and just generally not being social. The bullying ended up picking up right where it left off - same song new people. It was an all guys school (which was probably good at this point since it was less crushing to my spirits). I still went to the church group thing, and it was nice because there were a small number of people who I felt connected to. It helped me get through the week, and I was pretty religious for my first couple years of high school. I ended up finding a friend group towards the beginning of my second year. It was super awesome. I played games with them online and hung out at school with them. I got really into board games especially. It kind of went downhill quick though. I think I pissed off one of them with a rude comment and he blocked me online, and since I was the new one to the group they played with him over me. It was still relatively fine at school for the rest of the year. Eventually they all blocked me online though. 3rd year it started to go downhill (they were never really friends - surprise). Many of them got their licenses and started leaving school early so no board games after school. I was slowly being edged out of the group even though I was in the same homeroom as many of them. It ended up getting even worse 4th year when I got borderline suicidal again (not as bad as when I was 10, but still sucked). I felt trapped in a group that wasn't friends because outside of them I had even less, and at least I could pretend I had friends. 

&amp;nbsp;

So gotta go back a bit, but onto a different point because I don't know where exactly it fit in and can't make the transition. Over arching issue of loneliness. So I mentioned issues with my mother earlier, and here's where those will really come into play. I never really felt loved by her - narcissistic, emotionally abusive, judgemental, etc. I mentioned before how the girls thing was worse in the long run. I don't know when exactly I started feeling it (might've been anywhere from when I was 10 or 11 until 16), but I just really wanted to be attractive and have a ""girlfriend"" and go on dates etc. I desperately clung to the little bit of hopes I got from hugs from girls at the church group. Ultimately ended up backfiring hard because I asked one out to a dance, got turned down ""politely"" (later found out the reason she couldn't go was a lie), and felt worthless. This mixed into the 4th year suicidal thoughts a lot because I felt hopeless, alone, and worthless. I also ended up latching onto some college girls (roughly 3rd of 4th year I don't remember which) for attention (its complicated met them because of a friends older sister at a family Halloween party thing). One of them treated me like a creep (I was texting her way too much, but I also just didn't realize that at the time and if she had just told me I probably would have backed off) and I don't remember why I stopped talking to the rest, but probably my fault in some way. I was borderline heading down the path to become an incel (fortunately I did not). I also met a girl at university orientation (we do it in the spring even though semester is in fall). We talked a bunch over the first half of summer, and I worked up some courage to ask her out and got turned down and ghosted. Around the same time I ended up posting on the depression subreddit a couple of times. Got a response from an older woman who was willing to talk and listen. I was desperate for attention and immediately latched on. At some point she asked me some vaguely sexual questions and I got excited and encouraged her to ask more. Ended up forming an online sexual relationship. She did a lot for me with helping me sort through some of my shit, giving me encouragement, and giving me an outlet for my loneliness. First semester of college I made a lot of progress with her help in overcoming some of the more pressing issues of my depression. I got a new look which helped boost my confidence, she helped me explore my sexuality which helped me boost my confidence, and also pushed me to grow myself and work on myself. Having that support I was able to move forward quite a bit with a lot of the face level stuff and even some of the deeper stuff. I felt more at home in my own body, I felt more comfortable with my personality and interests, and I learned how to socialize in a healthier way. It was probably good for me, but probably not an appropriate relationship (she was married and was going through a rough time in life). I ended up fucking it up anyways. Haven't talked to her in a long while. 

&amp;nbsp;

Gonna focus on my University experience here it won't be super well structured time wise because I remember a lot more details, but its difficult to put it all in order. So during my first semester I successfully made a girl friend through class. I'm still friends with her now. We were never super close, but she cares and will talk to me when she has time. I also had/have a dog. There was one dog my first two and a half years, but she's gone now (cried so hard), now I've had another for a year that's a very good dog. They've helped me handle loneliness somewhat. I went to counseling my 2nd semester and got over my anxiety for the most part (its still there, but I can manage it fairly well). I was also on medication for a while, but it didn't really help much even when the dosage was increased so I just stopped taking it. My depression tends to be pretty cyclical. I have a rough base area and slowly slide down deeper and deeper into sadness before I crash hard for a little while and reset. The medication just extended that cycle and made any positive emotions feel more muted while the negative ones were just as bad. I have a good group of guys that I'm friends with and that's helpful. I'm pretty involved in an organization. I met an incoming freshman the summer before my sophomore year, and we hit it off really well. I was super into her, and we ended up cuddling a few times over summer. I had never cuddled before so it was pretty amazing, and there's just one moment that sticks out where I felt comforted and safe. It was probably something I should have felt from my mom when I was a kid, but it was the first time I remember that feeling. It was happiness like I hadn't felt in who knows how long (if I had ever felt that happy before). Its kind of bittersweet though because we aren't friends anymore. I still had toxic behaviors and was probably a little emotionally abusive and super clingy. It was more my fault than anything, but that friendship fell apart. I tried to be a good friend, but was quite misguided and pushed her away, and she was really flaky and kind of pushed me away a lot and made some of my self esteem issues come back. Ended up crashing hard between that friendship falling apart, taking on a major leadership role in an organization, and realizing the subject I was studying was not for me. I barely passed my classes and was borderline suicidal at the end of my sophomore year. I got better with time. I focused on being more comfortable with myself and reflecting on how I was and how I could improve. I also lost a lot of weight (I was a bit chunky coming to college, borderline obese at the end of my 2nd year, and have gotten back down to a healthy weight now). It was mostly better eating habits (CICO is pretty damn wonderful IMO), but I also did exercise more by walking the dog usually several miles a day. Big take aways were being more reflective on how I acted and how I could improve and that cuddling really helped my emotional state. I switched majors and my grades shot up and I really liked my classes. I kind of stabilized a bit more, but still just struggled with loneliness. I tried talking to girls a lot in class and stuff, used tinder and every dating app I could (albeit pretty ineffectively until more recently), and even messed around with going to parties and stuff. Its still a struggle for me because even though I can rationalize that I am attractive (not a 10/10, but like 7/10 or something pretty realistically), and that I am worthwhile and deserve love, Its just hard to believe it because I have had minimal luck with finding someone that's attracted to me/would want to date me. I did make a friend last February that's been super awesome and a friend this summer. The one in February had been a rock for me for the last year. She's an absolutely phenomenal person, super understanding, patient, and caring. If I'm completely honest I would really want to date her, and I tried asking her out, but got turned down. We still became good friends despite that though. We would hang out and go on hikes, and sometimes chill out and watch movies. It was honestly felt like the best possible thing for me because I still wasn't really ready for a relationship (I'm still really not), but having a close female friend was just nice. The other friend is pretty cool too. We're not like super close, but we have a hobby in common and will hang out and do that. We hung out and cuddled once too which was great! Either way between the two of them I've been getting better at healthy friendships and just managing my loneliness better. Other things before I get into the current issue I have ... I had a one night stand from tinder once - only time I've had sex. I've had the chance to fool around a little outside of that, but its always ended up being a onetime thing. The one night stand was good because I felt very stigmatized with being a virgin, but all the one time things kind of suck because I am much more of an emotional and long term person so I always end up feeling sad. I never intend for them to be onetime things, but I end up being ghosted after so \\|'_'|//. I've had some pretty in depth talks with some of my guy friends and its helped being able to vent, but they aren't able to provide much support. I feel like there's other things I can't think of, but I am blanking right now so I guess its time to jump into current issues.

&amp;nbsp;

So the less close friend I hung out with got in a relationship over Christmas break. She's super happy and I'm glad, but she has a lot less time for me in general which kind of sucks. I was relatively stable for most of this school year (I have my ups and down, but I've managed it well). I have been in a down trend on my cycle in January/February (oh boy Valentine's Day!) so I hung out with the close friend that will cuddle with me and stuff. I got through the day for the first time in years without crying my eyes out and being incredibly depressed. It pushed me back in my cycle, but it also set up this cycle to be worse. She had mentioned a tinder date previously and had plans to hang out with the guy again. If I'm being honest the idea kind of upset me, but we're just friends, and her happiness is important to me so I dealt with that. I knew if she got into a relationship the cuddling would be a no go. Which as much better as I have gotten, I still rely on that a lot from time to time to stay in a more stable state (once every month or two is usually enough). I know its not healthy, but I haven't really figured out a way to cope with being lonely (username reference haha). It helps and I have a lot of other stuff to focus on that is much more time sensitive than emotional problems. I need to graduate, get a job, and be financially independent in the next few years (I plan to cut off my mom to help my mental health). There's a lot of unknown and foreign stuff here, and I'm not good at handling change super well so I'm trying to prepare myself to be independent and do my own thing and be able to support myself. Its a lot, but I'm scared of moving back in with my parents and never moving out because I'm too scared to figure it all out and be independent. Either way knowing that a relationship was pretty likely kind of put my bottoming out lower than normal because one I'm really dependent on the cuddling/attention and two because if I'm totally honest I really really wish we could be more than friends. I'm not going to claim its perfect or even close to that, but rationally she's got a lot of what I would want from an SO. We have really good chemistry on a personal level just like talking and joking around and stuff, she understands that I have mental health issues (I don't think I've ever gone super in depth with her, but she knows the important stuff) and is patient with me/puts up with my neediness/supports me, she genuinely cares for me and makes time to me and talks to me, and we just have a good balance of similar interests without like too much in common so we can be our own people, but still do stuff together. I know part of it is that I've just never felt cared about in this way (like ever), and so I am latching on because it couldn't happen as she's just not interested and even though I don't like that I have to accept it. It sucks seeing someone you are crushing on be with someone else. She is in a relationship now, but we'll get to that in a minute. So since February I've been on the downtrend. I had a mini crash in March due to a show I watched that got me really emotional, but it wasn't the hard crash that is coming. So with this I have been doing a lot for my organization and keeping up with school pretty well. I actually took a major role halfway through the semester and am taking an additional major role for next semester. The one I took first is a super crucial role and is putting a decent amount of stress on me, and I just had a lot of deadlines in school (thankfully the biggest ones are over), and I screwed up my grade slightly in one class. So over the last few weeks I've been getting drained because I have so much that I am trying to do and while I really enjoy it, it still just takes a lot of work while being in an emotionally rough state. My plan was to try and stabilize by hanging out with my friend (the one I am pretty darn close to) and cuddle and make it through to summer where I'd have a lot less stress and could just work on my emotional state. Well this is where shit really has hit the fan for me as you can see where its all headed. Well it was my birthday a bit ago so I had hoped we'd be able to hang out and cuddle then (Honestly I put all my eggs in that basket because that's all I really had to hope for). I was semi aware that she was in a relationship (not certain, but putting two and two together I knew in the back of my mind), but I just really was desperately hoping for that attention. We did end up hanging out, but it was a hard no on the cuddling thing which confirmed my biggest worry - no more cuddling. Hanging out was nice and helped a bit, but I ended up super upset (set myself up for it). I am still just in an emotionally fucked up place. 

&amp;nbsp;

I really want to reach out to ask for help, but the guys I've talked to really just don't do well at empathy and I'm just not as comfortable around guys (see way above), and the two girls I talk to are both in relationships and with my current state it is unhealthy for me to try to reach out for help because a portion of that would be the physical attention. Its not really healthy to just bottle it all up though either and I should reach out. That's about the current state though - not reaching out is really unhealthy for me (I know from experience), but reaching out also isn't a good option because I'm in a particularly unhealthy emotional state. Its really fucking me up, and I kind of start to reach out before stopping myself and getting more upset and repeat. I can't have an emotional crash either because I have to finish out the semester well, keep up with my responsibilities which are super important to the organization, and I start my summer job right after school ends.

30,"I’m nearing the end of a semi shitty childhood. I live in upper middle class suburbia, so I could be much worse off. My mom is very mentally ill. There’s too many years worth of shit to get into but I’ll offer up some highlights. My dad used to be pretty rich so she put a hole in the condom and trapped him into marriage. (She has admitted this.) I’ve had over 20 pets I can remember in my 15 years of life and never more than two at once. She just always gets rid of them as soon as I get attached to them. She’s just generally very ocd and unstable. She repeats everything she says 4-5 times. She’s gotten my dad fired from jobs and dragged us into debt. She always needs a new car, phone, and/or house. She faked a wrist injury to get my dad arrested. She threw my computer at me once, although she really does not abuse me she’s just crazy. I have videos of her threatening to beat the shit out of me until the cops come.  There’s a lot more I’d rather not publicize. My point is that I fear that the depression I’ve always suspected I had is beginning to evolve. If I end up like her I won’t be able to handle it. I feel like I’m experiencing mania. All day today I was on a high, and my thoughts were racing. I could feel myself bothering everyone around me because I couldn’t stop myself from talking. All of a sudden in my last class, I felt my eyes tear up. A wave of sadness came over me and I just needed a good fucking cry. Nothing particularly bad happened, I was just suddenly not okay. Some more background info: I’d like to consider myself pretty intelligent. I have a decently high iq, as my iq score granted me admission to the gifted program in second grade and I’ve maintained my place. I just do not apply myself. My biggest fear is getting stuck in a 9-5 job I hate. I’m constantly paranoid about my wasted potential but not enough to actually do anything about it. I refuse to apply myself to things I don’t care about, and I definitely don’t care about the vast majority of my classes. I don’t mean to sound arrogant, I’m just being lazy.

So it is not as if I WANT to eat gross things as much as I imagine how disgusting it would be if I did. For example, opening a can of cat food. It looks/smells disgusting and I both imagine what it would be like if it got in my mouth or if I just ate it. If I walk past a nasty sandwich in a bag on the sidewalk I wonder what would happen if I ate it and how gross it would be. Then I get disgusted.

I was caring for someone's teeth at work (Im in CNA training) and her teeth were basically rotting. Stuff is coming out all over the brush and a part of my brain goes into ""what if that got put in your mouth?"" Or feeding a resident ""what if you spaced out and started eating using their utensils?""

Is it normal to want to meet your partner more than once a week? Both of us have demanding jobs and I always try my best to make time for him. Both of us have our own social lives too and I get that we don’t necessarily have to mingle the two. 

I am mindful about the fact that both of us express love in different ways and I always try my best to make him feel loved, since we meet once a week and the phone is our only medium of contact.  Just btw we live about 1.5 hours away from each other via public transport. 

I feel neglected by him. I have to walk on eggshells because I know, any talk about our relationship and he shuts down. We love each other a lot and the only way I know is because he’s cried in-front of me once during a discussion when I mentioned I feel ignored. He gives me warm cuddles and kisses to which im very grateful. I don’t force him to say I love you and I don’t mind that he says it to me once a month. 

I have history of depression but I managed it well, not letting it affect relationships around me and haven’t relapsed in about 5 years now. Over the years I have worked on my self confidence/self love and maintain a healthy lifestyle. I don’t know where i’m going wrong. I have shrugged everything off before because I never wanted him to feel im clingy. 

I am not going to lie though. Since a week this has been catching up with me and I have only been crying. I have tried to have loving and honest conversations in the past about how I feel. We were away for holidays for about 2 months ( I went out with my family). I tried initiating some intimacy by sending him a few sexy pictures but kinda got shot down. In low moments like this I cannot help but wonder am I not attractive to him?  Is it too much to want your partner to make you feel loved and special like once a month? Is it too much to want to have conversations on phone with him 2 days a week and not just have transactional conversations on text?

My appetite is suddenly gone. I only want to sleep. Im constantly crying. I need advice. Should I seek a therapist?",03May2019,3

I tried putting in both headphones and blocking everything out w my music but I could still hear people talking and the audio from the video and it was stressing me out a ton. luckily my psych teacher said we could leave at any time during our lessons on mental health and he wouldnt ask any questions so I walked to a stairwell in my school that nobody goes to and just cried for a few minutes and tried to calm down. after a while I went back to class then went home after. when I got home I layed in bed but I would get random itches and they irritated me a ton. this has happened a few other times, does anybody have any explanation for this? anything helps, thanks",03May2019,5

39,"-disclaimer- I am aware a diagnosis can only be done by a professional. As a warning this is really lengthy.

Im  F17 and I need a second opinion on this before I bring it up to my mom. Im not sure when this started but I will try my best to collect my thoughts as I tend to ramble. I have not been diagnosed with anything since Ive never seen a professional to begin with.

When I know my stepfather isnt home I cant help but stand up constantly to look out the window. I cant sit still thinking he might be home and hearing loud music outside only makes it worse (he listens to music really loudly in the car and thats how I know he is home at times). He isnt abusive in any way but he makes me nervous because he tends to complain about any little thing. When he is home, I watch my every step worrying I might do something wrong. Similarly in school or just being out anywhere, (this amplifies more when I am alone) I cant help but look around me every couple of minutes and feeling uneasy with the people around me. You never know when someone could be following you or watching. Alone in my room I'm nervous of doing small/normal things like dancing in the mirror because I feel like someone or something could be watching and judging me. I stop myself from *thinking* personal things in fear of someone being able to hear. 

I have trouble making friends because I think people secretly hate me or might use what I tell them against me. I also have a hard time keeping a conversation with new people bc I feel like they dont care about what Im saying and I am boring them to death. As a result, I only have 3 friends I talk to on a regular basis. With my best friend, I try the best I can but have trouble connecting with her emotionally no matter how much I try. When something happens, I try to forgive the person but the annoying grudge refuses to go away. I sometimes can go *days* with little to no talking to my friends. Im not angry or anything like that, I just dont feel like talking, but we still walk to class together and things like that. This never happens to me when I am at home. 

At this point, I can't even be in a relationship. Im always scared the person is cheating on me or that they only asked me out as a dare or prank. I dont interrogate my partner or anything like that because I know its abnormal and this isnt actually the case. Also because they might tell people around me that I am a crazy gf or something. My longest relationship is 6 months with atleast 4 breakups in between (this freshman year). This way of thinking has me in the dumps emotionally, only going away when I break up with them. I feel so insecure about myself and that my bf is thinking of leaving me for someone that isnt as bad as me. Sometimes, I am too nervous to ask to go to the bathroom during class because it feels like everyone is staring at me, calling me stupid, ugly or judging me. When I do go to the bathroom, if another girl is in there, I dont dare look at myself in the mirror (not sure why but probrably scared of thinking I have been looking ugly the entire day and feeling embarassed)I dont talk much at school so when I get home I cant help but talk and talk and never get to the point because I have so much to say and feel like no one wants to listen. (like I am right now) I always daydream about stupid things like performing something in front of the school, like a song (I cant sing tough if Im going to be honest) instead of focusing on what Im supposed to be doing. 

Sorry if this is a mess this is my first post ever and im scared shitless of judgement and someone I know finding this (even though the chances of that are next to zero) I have suspicion of having paranoid personality disorder (I can check off most of the symptoms) but want to make sure Im not being overreacting before I tell someone.",03May2019,8

Most everyone has been hospitalised for self-harm or suicide attempts. My friends and I are nowhere near suicide today. We all use each other as a support system, and it's wonderful. 
However, I can't stop thinking about what would happen if one of them did kill themselves, or if they just died in an accident or something. I usually have this fear, but it was recently made way worse by a demonstration our school did.
Before prom, they had the fire department come in and stage a fake accident in which several people are injured, and one dies. My closest friend, being in the drama club, volunteered to be an actor, and he was the one that ""died."" I can't put into words how fucking hard it was to watch firefighters pull his limp body out of the car, put him into a body bag, and then put the body bag into a hearse. That fucking broke me. As far as I can tell, this hasn't really had this much of an impact on other people who are also close to him. This was weeks ago, but I can't stop thinking about it. That made the idea of what would happen if he killed himself so much more real. I don't know what I would do without him, or my other two friends. I wouldn't be able to handle it. I can barely handle making myself dinner most nights. 
DAE deal with this fear? How do you learn to live with it? Should I tell him about how I feel? Is there literally any way to do without without sobbing in-front of him and risk overwhelming him?

44,"When I met you my sophomore year I thought that you were a very kind, caring person, and I was right. I’ve never met someone who truly and honestly wanted what was best for me as you do. It feels really great to know that there’s someone who actually gives a damn about me.

I know that you have a lot going on, but you always make sure that I’m okay, and I wish I could tell you how much I appreciate that. I wish I could just tell you how much I want the best for you too.

When you feel sad I wish you’d be able to talk to me more freely and not feel like you’re burdening me, because not being able to know when you’re down is what burdens me the most.

Wondering when you don’t answer my messages if you’ve attempted suicide again is what drives me insane, even though I know you’re probably asleep. Forcing you to come over at 12 am when you start talking about suicide then not mentioning it once upon your arrival makes me so sick to my stomach. Seeing the bags under your eyes and staying up until 6 am talking knowing you would’ve been alone all night if I hadn’t called fills me with worry.

I’m just dying to know that you’re okay, and to help you when you’re not okay, because I don’t know what I would do without you, I’m scared to lose you, and I’m scared to tell you that. I’m scared to make you feel like you have to keep yourself happy for me, because I don’t want that.

I want you to honestly tell me when you’re not okay. I want to be able to support you when you start struggling with suicidal thoughts and ED’s again, if ever you do. I want to know that you don’t feel a crushing isolation in your problems because you don’t know who to talk to. If you feel alone I want to be there for you as you have been for me.

It’s so incredibly hard to know that you’re struggling, I just wish that you’d let me in to help.

26 | F | NY (for background purposes)

Recently, my boyfriend encouraged me to quit my job. I have a lot of mental health issues and I was just quickly deteriorating mentally, I couldn’t cope. And before that I had jobs just as bad. No matter how much I argued that I couldn’t do that and leave everything to him, he would reassure me. And then he told me to take a break for as long as I need before trying to look for a new one because he’d rather me be okay than anything. God, it was like the biggest weight had been lifted off my chest and I’m learning how to breathe again, finally. Things were kind of starting to look up!

Cut to two days ago. Our roommate drops this bomb on us that they’re going to break the lease and we have until July to figure out what we’re going to do. Now, NY is expensive. Like, even a small studio apartment is 1500/month around where I live specifically. And trying to find somewhere cheaper with a cat? It’s like trying to find a lump of gold in a pile of dirt. And just like that, this 10 ton weight of guilt is laying on me. I can’t help but feel... useless. Like my very existence is a burden. It’s like, holding a job right now is about impossible for me because of my mental health; but not having one just puts all of this on him. Even just yesterday when we talked about it, he said he doesn’t mind carrying us because me being okay is the most important thing right now. And that I support him with other things. But it doesn’t change how I feel. Selfish, weak, like literal trash. I’m worried about him. He has a good job but if we find a new place, he’d be paying for... everything. I don’t know how to live with myself. How can I be a good person, a good girlfriend, if I leave this all up to him?

If we can’t find anywhere to live, we have to move back in with his god awful, physically/mentally/emotionally abusive, mean, tyrannical mother. Who hates me and takes no measure to hide it. In this tiny ass room that my cat will have to be cooped up in bc he’s an indoor cat and they don’t care about him since he’s mine and they leave all their doors open all the time for him to get out. 

I just feel... like I shouldn’t exist. Like it would be easier on everyone at this point.",03May2019,1
47,"Hey guys. Within the past four or so months, I was prescribed Paxil after I finally decided to take years of anxiety into my own hands. It's felt great and has been working really well. I recently got into a bit of an argument with my girlfriend that evolved into a somewhat productive discussion: Since I've been taking the meds, I've been extremely less affectionate with her than I had been before. Really low sex drive, not a lot of real physical intimacy of any kind, even the most minor things. I guess I haven't really paid attention to that since I've been more focused on battling the anxiety. A couple weeks or so ago, I only had a few pills left and wouldn't be able to get to the pharmacy for about a week, so I started rationing out my meds, taking some off days. Not smart, I know. I guess she had noticed that on the days I wasn't taking them, I was a lot more outgoing with her, we had sex for the first time in weeks, and I generally seemed like myself again. What I'm worried about is that the meds are essentially zombifying me, where I'm not feeling the negatives of anxiety, which is great, but I'm also not feeling any sort of euphoria or excitement. Does anyone else experience this? If you do, have you found anything that helps to overcome it? I've finally gotten to a good place mentally, but don't want it to take a toll on my emotional relationships with people.",03May2019,1

Extreme anxiety attack. Stayed in school because important lecture to attend (all the while struggling with the severe anxiety). Get home, hubby and I have to drop off one of our cars at mechanic. Traffic anxiety adds to my already high anxiety levels. I'm depressed and hating myself. Try to let everything out about how im feeling to hubby. Wrong time as he is stressed and we argue about our differences (he's very extraverted and doesn't understand why I, an introvert, doesn't enjoy talking a lot). It was a stupid argument that turned into me cussing at him for being frustrated with me when ever i open up because I'm never happy with who I am. I cry and bawl and sob so hard I feel sick. Just now barely starting to feel OK.  

My husband is actually a very good guy and does his best to support me, but stress levels due to financial problems created a spark just right for our argument. 

As much as I love him and appreciate what he does for me, he just doesn't understand how ****ing hard it is to deal with the daily struggles of anxiety and depression!

Years later, I had gone fully down the rabbit hole. I was obsessing and preparing for a situation that would probably never happen. Over the last couple of years, my mind has taken every opportunity to ""defend"" itself against people that it perceives is going to harm other people. Which is pretty much everyone. 

I will be having a really nice conversation with someone. For whatever reason, my brain believes that this person is going to hurt me. My brain then imagines myself ""defending"" but really just hurting that other person before they can hurt me. I can't seem to understand if it is some kind of unspecified threat. Or if it is based on physical or emotional based attacks. 

It gets worse. If I touch a tool or think about a tool and my brain will combine the two and it gets much more violent.

59,"Hi guys,

I started dating someone last spring. At first we were great together- practically inseparable and had a genuine connection. A few months into dating, we started having some issues. He started going through jobs pretty quickly and eventually got to the point where he stopped trying all together. His behavior started becoming more and more erratic/paranoid. It became pretty apparent to me that he’s been struggling with some type of mental illness, though I’m not entirely sure what. Things escalated, I begged him to talk to a doctor and he refused. Our problems came to a head in early winter and I made the difficult decision to break things off. It wasn’t that I didn’t love him,  I just couldn’t handle the weight by myself and the gravity of the situation started affecting my mental health as well. His family was in complete denial and enabled the situation, which only added to the tension between us. After our breakup, he completely shut me out. Wouldn’t speak to me or acknowledge my existence. I figured it was out of anger, so I let him be. 

We recently reconnected after months of silence. He explained that after our breakup, he completely alienated himself from his friends and family. He  ruined his relationships with l the majority of his support system. During this time, he believes that he was watched by the government and that they were hacking into his electronics. He didn’t leave the house for quite some time and feels that he has PTSD from it. Now knowing this, I can’t help but feel like our breakup was the catalyst for this episode. And I’m afraid that us being in communication again may only trigger additional issues for him if things don’t work out. He still won’t speak to a mental health professional and is in complete denial. I genuinely do care about him and want to do what’s best for his mental health. I don’t want to repeat this cycle/hurt him worse/hurt myself. 

I apologize if this doesn’t belong here, I’m just hoping to get some insight. Those of you struggling with mental health issues or have loved ones with mental health issues, how should I approach this? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Feel free to private message if you don’t feel comfortable posting. Thank you.",03May2019,2

It started like this... 5 years ago i had a terrible reaction to something i thought was weed (never figured out what it actually was). After a couple of hits i passed out and when i woke up i was having weird abstract visual thoughts in my head that i can not describe to you even if i tried, also i was hearing my thoughts out loud and i couldn’t tell if i was saying what i was thinking or if it was just in my head. mind you there were about 6 other people there and they all smoked the same thing  i did and had no reaction.  

The next day after i went home, i woke up and everything felt normal until i got into social situations. In social situations i would never have anything to say. people talked to me and i just gave them straight answers or just casually gave them like a fake laugh for a response.  and when i was forced to talk i had no conscience of what was appropriate to say or not. i remember i would say shit that was just down right  ugly or weird that made people uncomfortable and i would not care. Complete absence of a social conscience. i feel like everyone has a little type of anxiety or something that goes through your brain to let know you just did something stupid. As this goes on for weeks and i start to notice that my attention span, focus, energy, emotion, vision, sense of smell, taste, hearing also all go down the gutter too. I used to be really smart but this resulted in me not caring about school at all and just sleeping in class all day. When tests came i would still know how to do the problems i had already learned but i would need constant reminders of the first step. almost like the formula to do all the problems were at the very back of my head i keep having to pull them out.. when doing the work i already knew how to do it would take me twice as long and twice as much the effort to do it for some reason. i would go over the same step over and over again knowing it was simple but brain would just loop. on top of that i felt like a complete moron when trying to learn something new the Lack of taste had me eating food i originally didnt like, because to me everything tasted the same. at that point i had no preference of any type. even music that i used to love just became noise to me.  

after this there was a couple of months of me spiraling down to having no emotions at all. during this period i wouldn’t have even called myself depressed i literally just felt nothing. This lasted about 3 years.

1 year after this emotionless period, i still had the abscense of social conscience along with the abscence of my opinions loss of of my brain power, but however i got emotions back but i felt like i felt every emotion besides happiness. At this point i would say i was depressed... very depressed... this was probably the darkest point of my life. i lost a lot of friends and family members, and my  music  production creativity lost all my creativity and lots of other things that just went wrong. i just felt like i had nothing. I would also have this weird obscure mixture between sadness and anger for no reason that drove me insane. i started to hit brick walls and shit and yell and cry and do weird shit on instagram like spam the same picture on my story 20 times in a row. id yell and say mean cold hearted shit to my friends and people that loved me. the shit was terrible. i even went to a therapist and psychiatrist but didn’t continue either because i felt like the therapist was just saying psuedo bullshit and the psychiatrist was just so quick to give me drugs that could easily fuck up my mental forever. so i figured none of these dickheads are gonna really help me.

74,"Hello everyone. Sorry for the long post.

Long story short, almost 20 yrs ago I had a burnout, followed by major depression and a BPD (borderline) diagnosis. I had lost job, career, insurance, roommate, and almost all of my ""friends"", so the depression was well grounded.

After 3 gruesome years, of which I won't go into details, I finally found a psychiatrist who nailed the diagnosis and my healing process began. In the following years I met my husband, got married, and a year later could go off the medication to have my first child. For 9 years everything was fine and dandy. I had other kid, stayed at home caring for them and became a ""house manager"". I got fibromyalgia after the ordeal, very common, and luckily I manage it pretty well.

Then came a rough period. Several deaths in the family (one of them a parent), a move, financial troubles (I have to sue someone over the payment of a house I sold), and my son being diagnosed with ADHD, amongst other daily things (appointments, chauffeuring kids around, etc etc) became suddenly too much to bear, so I'm having a relapse.

Fibromyalgia flares up, I feel depressed, continously tired, drained of energy and very unstable. As it happens sometimes, the second time one is much more aware, so I reacted immediately, called my doc, who prescribed the good old combo again.

Now, to the point. I *am* coming out of this 2nd burnout, slowly but surely. I know and I'm very aware that it takes time and patience. But the biggest obstacle lives at home and sleeps with me. 

My husband can't deal with this aspect of me. He met me while still ill, he knew about the possibility of a relapse, I informed him well. And yet he lives in complete denial of my condition. Even worse, he gets angry at me when I'm irritable (I try to take time-outs to avoid yelling to my kids, I try to rest better and take care of myself), to the point that yesterday he yelled at me that he's ""tired of this situation and he can't believe my selfishness"". I told him, it's my responsibility to take care of myself in order to get out of this crisis and function normally again, not only for me, but also for the sake of the children. But he would have none of it. Right now he's become a toxic person for me. If I'm depressed, he leaves me alone. If I'm overwhelmed, he complains he has to go to work and I don't have to. If I'm down, tired and in pain from the fibromyalgia, I'm being lazy.

I'm not at a very good place right now. I don't have suicidal thoughts, but I fantasize about running away Forrest Gump-style.

Any tips, insights, experiences to share? I'd be very grateful for your input.

(PS: my kids are great. I explained them my current mental illness like a ""mental flu"". I'm unwell, I need to rest more, take my meds and take it easy for a while until I feel better. They got it quickly and are OK with it. I clash a bit with my ADHD boy, but we can even compare our symptoms and talk openly about our impulsiveness and forgetfulness and how we can get better. They are a handful, tbh, but they are loving and when I apologize for being a witch, they quickly forgive my impulsiveness.)",03May2019,1

76,"I moved in with a friend for a few months to save  a little money while I wait for my sisters lease to be up. My roommate recently broke up with her boyfriend. Since moving in, I’ve noticed some drastic changes. She’s losing a ton of weight. She suspects someone is hacking into her WiFi network and bought new equipment. She’s quick to accuse many of our close female friends having had slept with her ex boyfriend. The women who have been closest to her in our circle of friends (I assure you, they’re not) And when confronted, she denies it. She’s so quick to write people off, and I feel as if she isn’t herself at all. I don’t think she’s been actively going to therapy either. What do I do? I want her to get the help she needs.

78,"I was feeling severely depressed, it happens to me every few months. It’s usually around March to October and then it starts again during December and ends by January. It’s always like this anyway. 

I asked my parents for a psychiatrist but they suggested I talk to them. I told them i felt uncomfortable doing that but they tried to force me to do it so I just shut up and pretended like it was okay.

Anyway, for a few months I’ve been really stressed and depressed but suddenly one day I felt all calm, didn’t even feel hurt by anything and I just wanted to die. I don’t know how it happened but this numbness about not feeling hurting or not being happy or sad is scaring me.
Before when I thought of suicide I felt scared about it because of the pain but now somehow when I think about suicide I don’t feel as scared or scared at all by it. I feel like now the only thing stopping me from doing it is the necessity of it? I don’t feel hurt enough to end it right now, i don’t feel hurt at all but I feel pushed to the edge at the same time. 

I don’t know how to explain it fully I just need help, what if I do it? I don’t know how to approach this.
These few weeks I’ve been thinking so much that I go to sleep after 2 AM.  I’ve been getting only 4 hours of sleep and I don’t feel sleepy at all. I even tried to sleep, no phone, nothing, in a nice cold room but my body felt agitated and irritated, I keep moving and getting annoyed.

83,"I tried posting something like this in another realm. But just like the gyms I try to force myself to go to, I got talked down to by all the wannabe drill-instructors on their ""positive-angry"" tick. Essentially, when it sounds like someone's remotely complaining or stating a grievance, they shove ""positive thinking"" down your throat in a threatening or derogatory manner.   


That said, I see and feel the physical and health aspects of doing cardio and muscle workout. Clothes beginning to gradually fit a little looser, you begin to move quicker without much difficulty,. etc But overall, I feel as though nothing changes in my head when I'm exercising or during those few times I wasn't chunky in my life.   


There was a small time in high school and in my mid-20's where I was more physically active than I am now. Not much of a gut, more clothes fit, and I was moving alot quicker on my feet and on my bicycle. Then for whatever reason, I was still acting like I normally did while fat. Didn't talk to people all that much, never attempted to start any relationships with women, was irritated by the smallest of things., etc  


I don't know. I feel as though getting strong and fit does the same to me mentally as doing next-to-nothing and being in bed if I'm not working. The only things that seem to bring any of that ""euphoric"" joy to my head are decidedly, non physical things or slow physical things; long road trips in my car or motorcycle where I don't have to worry about getting back home too soon, going target shooting at the range, exploring certain areas on foot or bicycle, playing with model trains or RC vehicles, eating, drinking.  


I just feel the fact of physical exercise making someone happier is different for all of us. For some, they'll definitely get their feeling of high and mighty. For the small minority of us, it's nothing more than a chore, along with picky eating, to help us live a little longer and move a little quicker. I still try to keep in mind the importance of physical health and attempt to cut down calories/sugar, while also hitting the gym 2-3x a week for a few hours at a time.

87,"So, without giving too much away about myself, I’ve been in the Navy for almost a year and a half.  I’m losing motivation to even go out and make myself happy.  I’d rather just sit in the barracks and play video games or even lay in bed.  It’s starting to creep into my work life too.  I don’t feel like doing any of the work assigned to me and I hate going and working out and such.  I just feel like crap all the time and I think it’s starting to develop into a mild form of depression.  I don’t really have any friends because I’m moving all the time.

Before joining, I worked at Starbucks and loved my job.  I hung out with friends regularly and kept myself pretty busy.  I used to run a lot and keep my body healthy.  I usually felt pretty good about myself and even though I had lazy days, it’s nothing compared to what I’m dealing with now.  Like, it’s such a chore just to do laundry and keep my room clean.

What can I do to help keep me out of this mindset and stay healthy?  I want to eat better, but the only thing I have access to is a microwave.  I don’t think I need to see a therapist about this because I know I can get myself out of it.  I just need a road guide to keep me on track so I can start to prioritize things in my life that will make me happy again.

Due to shitty conditions in China I moved back to my small town in Southern Europe to work in a company that doesn´t provide good conditions. In addition,  I hate this town, there are no challenges in my current job and I have the feeling that I am surrounded by people who only want to be alive, no improvement or living. **I feel wasting my youth here.**

I’ve been confident, and I’ve been the encourager in my household, and I’ve been the “just don’t think about it, everything really will be OK, take it easy, be happy,“ person for a long time. I remember at some point being fairly disappointed with how I ate and took care of my body.

And slowly but surely, I have slipped into just being a mess of bad habits and anxiety about everything. *And I just noticed it all, and I’m afraid noticing it made it worse.*

I jump to worst case scenarios. I am constantly scared about money. I am finding myself short tempered, and everything from discovering that I didn’t get time off I wanted to having voice to speech misinterpret my dictation on this post just makes me want to launch into a spitting tirade of foul language. This hasn’t led to a desire for violence, or any desire to unload this anger directly at anybody, thank God. Just very easily frustrated with situations.

I’m not comfortable for an instant without my phone on me. I’m pathologically addicted to Reddit and Facebook. Name any amount of time that you think would be unhealthy to spend on social media, and I am probably well beyond that amount of time. By hours. I can’t seem to function at all without some entertaining distraction.

I love preparing meals, and what I prepare is pretty darn healthy. But I love salty, fatty, carb heavy fast food. I waste money and time and my health on it almost every single day. I can’t seem to just say no to it. I feel completely addicted. I can have a whole meal prep Sunday (shout out to r/mealprepsunday) and come Monday afternoon I want to pick up Burger King.

I know I haven’t always been like this. I don’t understand what happened, or how I let it happen, or how to get back to feeling OK. I’m 33 years old. I’m not a kid. I thought I had a decent handle on how my brain works at this point. I’m afraid that I’m just going to get stuck like this, like the cement is going to dry and this is going to be what the next half to 2/3 of my life is like.

I’m embarrassed to even be posting this because for all I know I’m just being an overreactionary wuss and there’s nothing that would really be called a mental health problem here at all. I feel like by posting this maybe I’m just looking for an excuse or something for my own bad habits, but I’m just not sure what else to do here.

My wife has shown me in a thousand ways that she loves me, and she appreciates all the times I picked her up when she was down. But I feel like that comes naturally to me, and she’s not especially sure how to handle it herself. She hasn’t needed that from me in a while, as she eventually came to realize perhaps she did need some professional help, and is now on medication for anxiety, and is absolutely kicking ass at life.

And then I feel awful if I dump stuff on her, because I realize we can’t always rely on other people for our own stability; some folks are great at talking things over and others aren’t and that *doesn’t mean they’re bad people* and it puts a lot on them if you just need to dump day after day.

99,"Ill jump right into it...

I'm 17 &amp; have struggled with generally poor health and moderate to severe anxiety and functioning depression for a few years. I often have poor memory and extreme difficulty in recalling concepts or words (like yesterday, I couldn't remember the simple word ""moron"" when talking to a friend &amp; it didn't come to me until 3am!). I've always been a good student and I love to read, but lately I find learning very difficult due to decreased brain function and it's not getting better. It's truly worrying me now. I've also noticed my mood, outlook on life and behavior progressively deteriorating for the past 8 months. As if that's not enough, I'm homeschooled and my school work has been suffering a great deal. I eat super healthy and go outside plenty but haven't had any desire to pick up any of my various instruments or skate for months now. Also I don't have any history of drug abuse (aside from a porn addiction &amp; sugar and caffeine :P). So I've literally noticed decreased intelligence in so much as understanding concepts and analyzing things, an inability to connect to people and art, music, or books and a general disassociation and an incapability of true empathy. These aren't caused by the depression. It's my head. It never feels right. I feel incapable of thinking and never want to learn nowadays, it's very difficult. My head is literally 100% blank most of the time and I dont remember things or think straight.

I now believe all my mental troubles are the manifestations of ""brain damage"" caused by solvents such as paint thinner (but I didn’t even use them that much :(. Im a rather sensitive bodied person and have an immune disorder so It makes sense that continuing to use them every now and again would do damage. I’ve increased my use of them over the past few months and have watched my mental health deteriorate and only last night did I realize it may all be because of my use of them. A few google searches confirmed my fears as far as the symptoms and I furthermore learned of the neurotoxicity and damage to the CNS paints and solvents have (which I knew of but was never fearful) and the fact that the brain damage brought about by them is more or less permanent. I’m really scared/upset.

&amp;#x200B;

**The story:**

(Feel free to skip to the end cause this is gonna be long and it's mostly for me cause im an idiot lol. Also excuse the occasional curse word :P)

I love to paint. Spray paint mostly. With that comes some use of solvents. When I was 14 I went to work with my grandfather regularly one summer. He does upholstery and builds/fixes furniture and I'd help paint or finish the stuff often and there was usually a good amount of paint vapor in the studio and I liked cleaning up the messes the paint left on the floor with paint thinner. My health started declining soon after as my skin would become really red and itchy and I'd get little red spots everywhere and headaches/brain fog and insomnia like you wouldn't believe. So I'd wear a mask and gloves most of the time and avoid the vapors but it was no use, so after about 2 months of getting sick every couple days I stopped going (shame cause he payed me good too). I was allergic to paint.

I never made the connection to the following but for the following months my health would continue to deteriorate. I'd be tired all the time, my joints hurt, I didn't sleep well, I couldn't think straight or remember stuff, light bugged me, little noises bugged me. My brain was bugging out. My skin was bad, eczema acne rashes etc and I lived in that hell for a few months before I got it sorted out with an allergist and he gave me some meds, a diagnosis involving my immune system and a diet to follow cause I already had gastric disorders and supposedly the chemicals in canned and preserved foods were harming my body. Ok, I slowly but surely was getting better. I did paint every once in a while though but was careful not to get it on me or breathe it in. Soon after, that same year, around November, I was hit hard with a bout of depression for literally no reason, I felt so fucking bad and didn't recognize myself anymore, it was scary. I told my parents, nothing came of it, I ate healthy and worked out here and there and read and did me and it subsided enough to write it off. I went the next year feeling kinda tired and unhealthy and complained to the doctors but nothing came of it. I got hella depressed again for a situational reason but I dedicated the next few months to bettering myself. that was last summer and I became the healthiest I've ever been.

Then in November, I did a mini paint project on an instrument of mine and I touched and breathed in a lot of vapor cause the clear coat didn't stick and was cracking and pulverizing constantly. I got sick. The symptoms subsided. A month later I realized I was really lonely and felt lost and got progressively more depressive and my mood deteriorated, I noticed this, but I blamed it on other reasons like me not getting out enough or doing worthwhile things but it didn't seem right. I felt myself slipping. So I took up skateboarding and art. I used sharpies and markers plenty and after about two weeks they made me really sick. Inhaling the fumes caused my throat to swell a lot among other things. So I stopped &amp; recovered. I still needed an outlet cause im getting more and more depressed so I take up painting again, this time hard core. I got into graff earlier this year. I got plenty of paint on my fingers and breathed in plenty of paint thinner and mineral spirits but I didn't care cause painting made me feel alive, even if I felt sick the next day or had a headache that night. I stopped about a month ago for a few reasons.

Now yesterday, I got some paint thinner to go buff (remove) some writing I left somewhere I regretted (a playground :(, I felt like shit that day and didn't tag it, just wrote ""keep peace chief"" and a heart balloon but I still felt bad). I touched it and inhaled plenty. I didn't sleep till 5am and had a panic attack at 1 in the morning cause I didn't remember what the hell I want out of life lol. I couldn't remember who I was and I knew it was the fault of the solvent. Then I did my best to think but my brain power/cognitive abilities were utter garbage so it took me about an hour to come to basic conclusions. One thing that blew my mind is that every damn time my mental health got worse could be traced back to the fact that I'd used paints, or solvents, or sharpies, or chemicals a month before. It was a ""Fuck..."" type moment. My brain feels so numb at the moment and I can't focus on anything and im disassociating heavily and nothing carries any meaning.

102," I have a mental illness that I have a hard time explaining to anyone, including doctors. But I've been living with it my whole life (28 years) and I'm desperate at this point for a normal life. Here's the situation.

So I have these ""scenarios"" that play out in my head. Sometimes they're just normal everyday events; sometimes they're really intense situations or arguments. However, when these things occur in my head, I verbally say everything out loud under my breath that I would be saying in that situation. For example, if I'm imagining getting into a massive argument, I will automatically start verbally responding under my breath, just loud enough for the people around me to hear me essentially talking to myself. I am literally completely unaware whether I'm thinking my response in my head or saying it out loud unless someone else tells me they can here me. To me, it just feels like I'm thinking these words in my head and not out loud. I can't control this at all unless I dedicate 100% of my focus to holding my lips shut. But if I do that, then I can't use that focus to accomplish other tasks.

To make matters worse, it's as if my brain adjusts the volume of my talking depending on how well I can hear myself. So if I'm wearing headphones in public, I'll start talking at almost full volume since I can't hear myself at all. I currently take antidepressants (I was suicidal in high school) and they actually help because I don't have super intense scenarios playing out in my head. However, the scenarios in my head, no matter how intense or relaxing, FEEL so real that it's like my body can't differentiate it from reality, even though my conscious mind can.

I've been dealing with deppression and anxiety on and off for a few years now and it seems to keep coming back worse and worse. 

 I booked a therapy appointment when my anxiety and deppresion was peak, I couldnt be around anyone even my family, I couldnt leave the house i was just laying in bed all day, couldnt even speak to people online, zero motivation or energy, I really wasnt feeling anything at all.  The last few days I've been feeling really really good, I've got a ton of energy, i just feel great, I know i shouldnt because i havent done anything to improve my situation but i just feel great.  I'm just really nervous to go if there isnt anything immediately wrong, i've never been to therapy before and its kinda freaking me out",03May2019,1

It used to be worse, I used to wake up feeling panic and dread,  and before that I woke up with a jolt, panicking and feeling like I couldn't take it. Now I wake up with anxiety and dread, everything that bothers me comes running to me all at the same time, I feel like I wish I'd died in my sleep. Every morning makes me wanna die (I also exhibit the signs of just plain not being a morning person, but I'm not talking about that). 

In the mornings, I feel sick in my body and my mind (I always feel sick in my mind but more so in  the morning). I feel like, well like I said, that I wish so bad I'd have died in my sleep. I feel like I'm going through drug withdrawal. 

I sleep during the day because my nighttime sleep doesn't do much for me because it's restless and tiring. Whenever I sleep during the day, it's good sleep for some reason, it is peaceful and I wake up feeling like I actually rested. That's how I used to sleep when I was a young child.

107,"First off..  i know where i am wrong, i know i am miserable, i know i don't have any correct justifications for the way i feel... or think.. so please spare yourself from commenting those.. 

I (24M) and my Girlfriend(23f) are on a long distance relationship. I am on a loan for my education and staying in Germany from the past 6 months. My girlfriend however stayed back in India. She has a best friend and he is very wealthy. Handles his fathers business and doesn't think twice before purchasing something.. she and him are best friends from 7/8 years and i am pretty okay with it. I met this guy, she kept everything clear from the get go and i was cool with it. I still am. 
We are fighting a lot now a days and she and I both aren't in our best stations mentally.  I am overthinking a lot and leaning onto anxiety and depression... i wasn't this way. 
That guy always wants the best for her and takes care of her in such scenarios. He visits her place every once in a while and i am completely fine with him.. she kinda gets these panic attacks and i am grateful for him being there to look after her in her sickness. 

I am not that well off economically and come from a middle class background.  I really want to buy many things for her and my parents but actually can't considering my money situation. 
We kept it this way and she knows this.. we kept it clean from the get go.. (3yrs) that economically we will split everything, share everything until we are in a position to lavishly spend. This time was different, when he visited her place... gifted her an Ipad, an Alexa thing, and let her shop for around 30k INR. He spent around 1500 EUR or 1600 USD just like that  because her mood wasn't right. 
I meanwhile sent her a package from Germany, containing the souvenirs i picked up for her when i was in Prague. She received them today. 

Some how both of these things happening at the same time put me into an emotional overdrive,  i just imagined a situation when she wants for something in the future but we have to think twice to afford, because she clearly likes costly gifts and she likes being pampered.  
What if i am not that good enough. . What if i don't score up to their level of pampering(gifts and all). What if she wants more and i am incapable, i know that she won't,  she doesn't care what i am money wise or what i am gifting her .... but what if she doesn't want anything from me for that same reason. I feel down somehow hurt, somehow feel like i am poor and ain't doing anything right. 
I don't know if i should feel this mixed emotion of happy, jealousy,  insecurity, fear, sadness. I cannot justify anything that i am feeling. 
No body is wrong in this situation... not her, she didn't ask him to gift anything,  not him because it was just an act of kindness al be it a costly one. 
What should i be thinking.  
I feel like i have been strong handed, this overwhelming feeling of insecurity money woes is killing me. I feel if he had thought of me before  atleast once maybe he would understand how i felt? Maybe he doesn't know or realize? But then again why should he? 
Maybe if she thought twice before accepting the gift, of how i would feel? Maybe she did, maybe she trusted me enough that she knew i wouldn't feel this way even of she did accept the gift? 
Maybe i am letting everyone down? 
Maybe i am the problem?


I don't understand and i am not very stable right now people.? 
Any advice for me, on how i can be less miserable,? Or how i can improve myself?



P.S. also they have a history together, once he proposed when they just became friends and she rejected him saying she didn't feel that way and still doesn't.. i am sure of that.. he seems cool with it and also they don't speak about it that much.


TL;DR : My girlfriend's best friend(M24) Gifted her some very costly things and it made me insecure about my( m24)  position economically.

116,"My tharapist thinks I have rage issues. It seemed reasonable because I've been going over alot from the past that makes me very angry when i think about it. 
Also, things have been tense between me and my girlfriend. We get in what i think are big arguments maybe once every week or 2. The arguments are about 5 minuites long and end in what i think is me yelling and walking out and after i can collect myself we usually talk normally, work it out, and apologize. I feel emense guilt from yelling at her but also justified because she is unreasonably mean when we argue.

Asside from anger, I usually just feel extreamly calm or melancholy most of the time. I rarely feel happiness or joy. When someone close to me dies.. nothing, if I'm hunting and dont kill something fast enough.. nothing. My girlfriend has a rough day at work and is crying.. nothing. Im sympathetic because i know I'm supposed to be.

After talking to my tharapist ive decided to work on my rage. I started by talking about my anger issues to my girlfriend and roommate. They both laughed at me. Turns out no one in my life asside from my mother, my tharapist and me think i have rage or anger issues.

My girlfriend doesnt like the fighting, but likes how we fight. She says the things i think i say to her out of anger are usually just honest truths or something thats been bothering me. After i say it she likes that we both can calm down and speak about it honestly. I told her ""yea but i yell at you"" and she says asside from when she kissed another guy i have never yelled at her our entire 3 year relationship. 
Apparently, what i think is yelling and being out of control is just talking sternly. I can accept that behavior from others, just not myself. 
I get very angry when i talk to my mother. My mother always says I'm violent and out of control. She was very emotionally and physically abusive during my childhood. My girlfriend and roommate confirmed that i sound frustrated during conversations with her but still am not yelling. I dont realize it though. 
Stress makes my head cloudy and i cant think clearly. 
That's why my girlfriend and i never are at eachothets throats for more than 5 minuites. I need a minuite to stop, breath and think clearly before i continue an argument or conversation. Thats why i excuse myself during fights, grab a glass of water or take a quick jogg if im feeling particularly upset.
As a child my mother never gave me that minuite. She would follow me and corner me and continue the argument. When i got bigger and tried to walk away, my stepdad would grab me and hold me down for my mother to continue her point.. often taking advantage of the fact that i was being restrained and hitting me. There was no escape. So i kicked, and screamed and fought. Going over my past and thinking of my lack of escape makes me angry.
The fact that in my late 20's i cannot visit my mother because she will still attempt to attack me this way, then she will say it was my fault. It hurts me deeply.

As an adult, my contact with family is structly via. phone. I think i need a minuite to process, let go and think clearly and I'm finally at a place where i feel can give myself that. Inspite of this my tharapist thinks that I'm actually just supressing my rage and not dealing with it.
Maybe i am. I dont understand my feelings and I dont know where to start.
Its hard to work through it when your partner doesnt think you have rage problems. 
None of my ex's do either. They always told me they were supprised when i was upset about something.
I worry that I don't know how to feel anything. 
I worry that maybe my girlfriend and i are having problems not because im angry but because i dont feel love. Shes not very loving to begin with so I'm forgetting what she needs. I dont feel it, it doesnt come naturally. I just copy it from others.

This is just my side. Im curious to know if anyone else with suppressed rage issues has similar experiances?",03May2019,6

119,"**My Issue:**

When I was suffering from depression (caused, in large part, by an undiagnosed case of ADD), I was always able to logic out that it was just a chemical imbalance and not go through it. When I went on Zoloft at 32, the mood swings and suicidal thoughts decreased, but they were still there. Again, though, I could reason out that it was just the chemical imbalance in my brain. However, when I started Adderall at 36, everything became clearer, and my biggest frustration was lost time. I never learned motivation, acquired any marketable skills, or built a reasonable work history.

Throughout all of this time, my wife has had to be the primary earner AND the responsible adult, which, in combination with issues she has from her own youth, has fostered an anxiety disorder within her. Every time I've tried talking to her about getting therapy, I've (unintentionally) gone about it in the worst way possible, and, at this point, even bringing it up makes things worse for her. 

Last night, after a lot of tears, she told me that she had been thinking that she was going to give me until June, and then assess whether it was worth it to keep going, or just get a divorce. It lead me to have a completely logical revelation; if I die, she'll get my life insurance ($50,000), but if I live she either gets continued stress with me, or a divorce where she won't have to worry about me anymore. I'm currently working as an UberEats delivery driver, making about $300 a week, because it's the highest paying job I'm capable of getting, and I still need to learn self-motivation. I'm mentally where I should have been at 19-22, so even though I'm trying to make up for all this lost time, I don't think I'll be there anywhere near that soon. 

If I get a divorce, I'm not even sure I'll be able to afford a place to stay. I'm almost 100 pounds overweight. I'm always had trouble forming deep connections with anyone, so I have no friends, and it feels very late in life to start making them. I may be able to meet someone else, but I worry that I probably won't.

As such, *I would literally be worth more dead than alive.*

I woke up this morning, and I'm having trouble convincing myself I shouldn't do it. I worry for my children, but I've always carried a large level of anxiety that I would ruin them anyway. I was able to convince myself that my wife and I could balance each other out, but if we divorce, then there's not even that anymore. I would try a suicide prevention line, but they don't know me, so any kind of positive affirmations they'll give will do nothing.

So for clarification, 20/F living in Michigan and myself and my boyfriend have been living with a roommate (old friend of his and a family friend) in our apartment. Said roommate went away for a couple of months for work and while gone apparently suffered from a psychotic break. After suffering a series of intense paranoid delusions (thinking everyone was after them, that there was a group out to get them), they were sent to the hospital for a few days and we've been getting updates from their cousins who live in the area. After being let out of the hospital, they've decided it would be best for him to take some time out from his work and come back to the apartment. Me and my boyfriend are homebodies, he's a college student and I work from home, so we're happy to have them back to help them recover however we can. The trouble is we weren't expecting them to arrive in the state they were in. 

Since coming back last week, their condition has been quite extreme, mostly them sitting around the living room and kitchen very tensely and rarely engaging in conversation outside of mumbling for us to stay away from the windows or be careful about people who might be out to hurt us. It's led us both to feel very tense around them (and in the apartment in general) and uncomfortable with what to say - it's hard to even spend time together as they're quickly overwhelmed by any music/movie/game. They've also usually been quite good about picking up after themselves but since coming back have just started loving food, drinks and dirty dishes all over the place, and we feel uncomfortable confronting them in their current mental state. In our own home, we feel confined to our bedroom with occasional trips to the kitchen. 

Mostly I'm just posting here in case anyone has advice, because we both really do love our friend and only want to make things as comfortable as we can for them. Thanks to anyone who reads this and has advice to give.",03May2019,1

132,"Hi all,

I have been trying to consider what is going on in my brain and can't nail it down. I have been having intrusive sexual thoughts since I was a teenager. I have been dealing with it by compulsively masturbating for years now and I really want this to stop. I experienced childhood sexual abuse and was molested by an older friend of mine when I was about 10 years old. I am not sure how much of this I blocked out but I can remember various times that it happened.

These thoughts have caused me to act out in many ways that I am not proud of. First of all I become absolutely obsessed with attractive women that I know or just women I pass on the street. I immediately think about having sex with them and sometimes I will think about them for days at a time or they will reenter my thoughts months later. I basically can't be around female friends because I am nervous that I will try to sleep with them (it has happened before and I was successful) and it is causing me some serious distress due to social isolation. I have cruised for gay sex before (I am very much not gay or bi and have really explored this over the years) and became obsessed with trying to have casual sex with men and women. I used Tinder for hours a day just hoping to find someone to sleep with and used to frequent Craigslist personals when that was a thing. I routinely seek out porn or cybersex for hours at a time. It is basically the only thing I do for ""fun"", but I recognize that it is really just a way to get relief from compulsions. Just looking at porn makes me feel better even if I don't masturbate at all.

I have bipolar II and have had a lot of other compulsive behaviors in the past (drinking, drugs, cigarettes, food, fasting, exercise, etc) and I wonder if this is related. I haven't been hypomanic in about a year now and I am curious if anyone else has had this experience and if it is even related to BPD or something else like OCD.

134,"Ok, I'm going to try to keep this as brief as possible but please bear with me. There is a TL;DR at the bottom.

My (25F) step dad Brian's (41M) mental health has been steadily declining for the past 6 years and I don't know how to help. Brian has spent his entire life enduring tragic circumstances, including a devastating spine injury that has left him in horrendous nerve pain for the rest of his life. When you look at the events of Brian’s life, it can look like he is just perpetually unlucky. He’s had an array of weird illnesses: pleurisy, seizures, tumors, scarlet fever, glaucoma, mumps, salmonella….the list just goes on. He is (and has been since childbirth) unhealthy. To add to this, Brian is a smoker and lives a generally poor lifestyle: no exercise, consumes little water and little food. Despite this, Brian has always been a hard worker. He maintained a 4.0 in graduate school while working 60 hour weeks as a retail store manager and raising 2 kids. He is an extremely smart and genuine person who has always worked hard.  

HOWEVER. 6 years ago things took a bad turn. One day, we get a call that Brian has been taken to the hospital because he had a heat stroke at his job. He had to be off work for a long time and after some thought, my parents decided that it would be best for him to not return to work for a while. My mom decided that she would work two jobs and let Brian take a year or two off to regain his strength, focus on his health and take care of his two kids (7F and 8F at the time). This would be good, I thought, because Brian would finally get healthy and we wouldn’t have to deal with the costs of childcare.

The plan was for Brian to regain his health, finish his degree and then return to work but that’s not what happened. What happened is that Brian became completely depressed. He began staying up all night watching anime, web-surfing and sleeping on the living room couch all day long. He would wake up at 4 or 5 pm and watch TV with his kids. He did not partake in cleaning the house, exercising, socializing or anything remotely healthy. He did not take his kids out to play. He smoked a pack a day, drank 6 cans of coca-cola a day and never left the living room couch.

As you can imagine, this was very disruptive to our household and I became increasingly resentful of him. My mother was working her ass off at two jobs and then coming home to take care of EVERYTHING because Brian couldn’t get off the couch. There were fights constantly and all Brian could ever say was that he was in too much pain and was too depressed about his economic (defaulted student loan debt and poverty) and his health situation. When it came time for him to start working again, he wouldn’t apply for jobs so my mom had to apply for him. Finally after 3 years of 24 hour couch, my mom got him a job at a shitty government call center making $40,000 a year. But he couldn’t appreciate it. He didn’t want to work. He said that a $ 40,000 call center job is an insult to his Masters degree from Penn State and he will never be able to provide for his kids with it. So he reluctantly started working again but his depression continued to worsen.

Fast forward to today, Brian is still in the same 40 k job that he loathes. He has no friends or social interactions with anyone but us. Even when he is with us, he never looks up from his phone. He is scrolling endlessly on Facebook 24/7, doing nothing but reading inflammatory political articles. When we do talk to him, he is extremely pessimistic and increasingly paranoid. Yesterday, he was started talking erratically about how the government is tracking our every step and how we need to be careful about declaring our political beliefs because at any moment, “they” could decide to kill us, like they did MLK. He will explode and go out hour long tangents about the health care system and how it is destroying him, etc. To him, everything is devastating and hopeless. Any rebuttal is met with complete indifference and all our pleas for him to get help are ignored. We have called his parents, called his sister, begged him to talk to a therapist, to go to a hospital or do ANYTHING and he just won’t. He barely communicates with his kids (12F and 11F now) and my mom is on the verge of leaving him despite truly loving him.

What can we do? He will not see a therapist and refuses medication. I love Brian, he is a very nice and generous person but his mental illness has been hurting our family for too long.
 

TL;DR: My (25F) step dad (41M) is a sweet, intelligent and genuine person but he has become increasingly mentally ill and it is hurting everyone in our family. He refuses to get treatment, but he is becoming more isolated and paranoid every day. How can we help him?",03May2019,1

137,"I have always had anxiety but have always been really good at hiding it i.e. even though I feel internally anxious, I have always been able to be very social and carry conversations really well. Everyone I've met has always complimented me on my social skills and ability to get along with anyone.

Now recently I don't seem to be able to do this anymore. My anxiety is even worse and I can barely string a sentence together. Even with my good friends I can hear myself talk and it is very disjointed and uncertain, which makes me panic even more because it is obvious I feel anxious for whatever reason.

Has anyone experienced this before? I'm worried my anxiety is just taking over or something, but I'm hoping its temporary?",03May2019,1
138,"I’m (21F) in treatment for OCD and depression currently, I take sertraline for both.  I feel relatively comfortable with both diagnoses- I feel like they describe my mental problems very well and I’m most likely on the right course of treatment, I don’t think I have any other mental illnesses. 

It seems like the NHS wants me to be more ill. I recently saw a dr who thought my OCD symptoms were actually a sign I was in the early stages of psychosis, which I very much disagree with, and everything has just got worse since then. They now think I have a personality disorder, and I’m supposed to go to an assessment to confirm this and start treatment. 

I can’t help but feel this is all excessive and there’s nothing wrong with me. I’m doing much better with my depression and OCD on my current medication and I don’t notice any sign that I’m more ill. I also feel like other people would definitely notice if I had something as serious as a personality disorder and the people I’m close to think I’m fine. But it’s hard to know for sure. I feel like my doctors are trying to punish me or something, and I don’t know how to get them to listen to me. 

Does anyone else have experience with collecting diagnoses they feel are incorrect? Any advice would be much appreciated.",03May2019,1

Days we can sit in silence, thoughts tumbling deafeningly as the time passes by. Waiting for our hopes and dreams to tumble into our laps. 

Our pain hidden behind, hide and seek, laughter and the pitter patter of feet.

 Our hearts filled with overwhelming love and joy as your mind clouds with thoughts, sending them into termol. 

That sinking feeling, coming and going. Fear crawling up your spin, doubt rushing your veins as the day flows. 

Hiding behind the doors just so you don’t have to face the world outside. Pretending, it’s ok to stay a little while more. 


Anxiety, depression and mental health isn’t something to be ashamed of. We suffer alone, hidden in dark. Unpolished gems waiting to shine in the sun, glimmering away with a twirl. 

Five years I’ve lived with it, recently I’ve made improvements instead of standing, hiding and living in the dark. My improvements may seem small, yet, they are huge accomplishments. 

Don’t hide your glamour, share it, spread it and be it! Don’t let mental health rule you, speak up, scream and shout and learn to live free!",03May2019,1
141,"For all my (39m) life my anxiety had been telling me no one likes me, that everyone I meet is laughing at me behind me back, taking the piss out of me. I can imagine the most ridiculous scenarios for ways people must be excluding me from things (things that aren't even happening).

I feel a pressure in my chest, the urge that I mentioned before, sometimes I even start ""softly"" shacking, and my mind is like: ""please end, please end, please end"" and "" finish it, finish it, finish it"".

I start to feel hot, also. 

It even happens when I'm actually doing nothing, and It's like, I have an urge to finish something that I'm not doing.

I tend to stop to relax a little and tell myself: ""calm down, you can't finish the thing like this"". But as soon as I start over I feel agitated again.

145,"I was abused in multiple ways as a child (verbal, psychological, physical, neglect, sexual) by multiple people including my parents. There was a time when CAS was called on my house but they never discovered the extent of things and I stayed in that situation. I am quite open about stuff that happened. But for some reason I still can't stop ruminating over things sometimes. The thoughts distract from my life and make me less productive. It's also hard to connect with people when these memories are running through my head and they are happy. Does anyone have resources for coping with past abuse that was never fully acknowledged?",03May2019,2
146,"I don’t think this is a mental health issue but my family doctor has no explanation for me.

Basically the issue is like this:

When the sky looks like a stormy ocean I feel like I’m under water. My face gets puffy and my vision gets narrow. But most of all, my mind is completely clouded, It used to put me in a bad mood but now that I recognize the cause I can manage my emotions much better. With ADHD, this stormy mindset makes doing anything really difficult and I get nothing accomplished until the sky begins to clear. In my city it’s often overcast and therefore I have several bad days per week. Sometimes I can even predict when it will get overcast, I can feel the pressure build and if I lose focus, the clouds roll in soon after. Strong winds also accompany these symptoms.

For reference, I’m a personal trainer currently. My income is based on my clientele. I do work 25-35 front desk hours weekly so that’s steady pay, but it’s not for much at all. Most days involve me waking up at 4:00 am and working front desk until 10. Afterwards I usually train 2-3 clients until 11. I then head home and take a quick nap, then head back to the gym at 2:30ish for a workout. 4:00-5:30ish is spent prospecting on the gym floor. 5:30-7:45 is training more clients. 7:45-8:30 is more prospecting. I usually leave the gym about 9, go home and get to bed as quick as possible. I’m usually in bed by 11 or so after taking some time to quiet my mind. Get back at up at 4, rinse and repeat M-F. Saturday I usually have 1-2 clients then work front desk for about 6 hours. Sundays I try to relax but feel guilty after a few hours of relaxing when I feel like I could be out doing more marketing for myself and what not.
