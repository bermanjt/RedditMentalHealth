0,"I'm severely depressed and in some pretty dark places. I tell myself I want to die all the time and how I want it to stop... But I know I won't ever do it. 7 years ago my brother attempted suicide twice and it left me in a pretty bad way. I've seen the other side. I don't want my family feeling that way. Is this normal? The thought of being free from everything is amazing, but I saw what it did to myself and my family. Am I 'allowed' to be suicidal but not want to do it?",11Aug2019,1
1,"Knew him for over 20 years and found him on Facebook just three months ago. He knows who I am by the way. I didn't know who the person in the photo was after I posted a photo of me and him on social media and he found me and said it was him and even said he was friends with my aunt. I told him it was nice to meet him again and he didn't respond though. My cousin wrote on his Facebook wall saying ""how's it going Brian? You were talking to my cousin, Serena (me) the other day"" three months ago and tagged me in it. Would it be too late to post a comment and say: 

""I know this post by cousin Theresa was made three months ago and I'm a little late in commenting, but, I remember you from when I was a kid, just didn't know what your name was at all, but I recognized you in the family album. My mom told me many years ago that you moved away to Mexico when I've asked about you as a child. I just want to let you know that I think you were one of the coolest and nicest people I've met in my childhood :D"" 

Does this comment sound flirty, weird, or odd? Many people have told me it was. He's almost 50 and married so I have no intention on hitting on him.",11Aug2019,1

Since that first notification, everyone had been on edge since. He passed away a couple days ago now and tensions seem even higher. Everyone in my family has been prone to just snapping at each other for no good reason other than the stress of his departure. I just want to run somewhere at this point as I just can't take it anymore. I miss him but the stress from the aftermath is tearing me apart. I feel numb, empty, crazy, and a bunch of other rapidly fluctuating emotions. I feel like I have no one to confide to anymore.",11Aug2019,1
4,"Hello!

I'm a 24 year old male from england, this is my first ever post on reddit and I came here after I experienced (at least what I believe to be) some mild hallucinations.

The most recent hallucination was while I was laying on my bed in the dark while watching TV, after the show I was watching skipped to an ad, I started looking around the room and noticed that the shadow from my lightbulb was twitching, this didn't scare me but what did was when I looked directly at the shadow and it kept twitching around 3 inches at a time from the left to the right, the shadow would stay in the same place for about 2 seconds before twitching again.

Intrigued by this I decided to stand up on top of my bed and noticed the shadow has stopped twitching, I then laid down again and it started to twitch again.


About 4 moths before (around 1:30 am) I was laying down in the dark, with the TV on, scrolling through Facebook before I decided to get some sleep.


I had shined my phone light around my room to look for the TV remote and noticed the the center of everything I looked at suddenly become enlarged, worried I decided to look at my hands to see if the sane thing would happen and sure enough they become enlarged.


About 11 moths ago for about a month I stated experiencing mild auditory hallucinations, the most common one's were people calling my name, hearing my phone ringing and hearing the sounds of animals.


I come from a neglectful background but I have never experienced any form of physical abuse, although my older sister had dropped me on my head when I was 1 but I didn't receive any noticeable injuries (never went to the hospital about this).

Is this something I should get checked out?",11Aug2019,1
5,"hey, just found this sub. i (21f) don't know if it belongs here but i would like an outside opinion. 

I've been dealing with depression for a while now. i think I also have anxiety issues but I'm not exactly sure. i wanted to pose this situation to you guys and see if someone could possibly help. 

i over think everything and it's starting to ruin my perspective on life. my best friend asked me to be his girl and i was ecstatic, but we decided to wait until after a semester of me being away (same state, just different cities since I'm going to grad school) to make sure we aren't just blinded by the fact that we're together everyday. but since he asked I've thought about any and everything: if I'll make enough money for a house and child, if he'll be able to graduate in the spring, if he'll actually want to be with me after us being apart for weeks. my other two best friends seem to be hitting it off too (sounds like a tv show or something i know) and i can't help but compare us to them. the other guy seems to have his life together (we're young so i can't expect my guy to be the same) and is smitten with her, while we're already used to each other but i keep having the same thoughts that he only likes me bc he's been sad before and I'm always sad, so we have that emotional connection i guess. I've seen how he acts when we do things that i enjoy but he doesn't really care for- he shows that he's disinterested, while I'm open to enjoying his interests if it makes him happy. i feel like a bitch saying it but i feel like there's reasons why i shouldn't date him but i can't see myself with anyone else. i snap myself out of it and then the cycle starts again. 

i start to get excited about dating my best friend and hopefully marrying him, then i look up costs of a wedding and a house and how much i need to save for a child and a car and how the job market for pharmacy is going to implode soon so I might not get a job and my depression will worsen to the point where I'm crying on a daily basis again etc etc. i don't know if this is anxiety to an extreme or overthinking. i don't know how to stop it without feeling like I'm absolutely lying to myself that things will be okay. it's gotten to a point that I hold resentment towards everyone bc im making myself so sad while those two are discovering romance and i feel like I'm just a back up plan.",11Aug2019,1

Anyways, onto the story.

It started in 4th grade, I was bullied a lot and it was relentless until 6th grade. The teachers didn’t help, and one time I ended up getting in trouble for telling on the same group of boys too many times. My parents didn’t really help me either as they are they type to say “suck it up” and stuff like that. My parents are also very traditional and are against LGBT+ and a lot of the things that are very relevant in today’s society. I also had terrible mood swings when I was younger, and I always got in trouble, even though I couldn’t control what I was feeling. 

Part of the reason why I was bullied is that my Mother is very protective of me. I wasn’t allowed to play video games until 5th grade, and I never watched TV until 7th grade. I couldn’t relate to anything anyone in my class talked about and I had only two friends. They sort of understood, and their houses were an escape for me. I would go over and I learned so much. I watched Phineas and Ferb, I learned about Minecraft, and I started to learn a lot about the world that I was sheltered from. 

One of the things I learned about was LGBT people. I had never really heard about this before. At the end of 6th grade, I realized I was bisexual. I KNEW I had to keep this a secret from everyone, or I would basically be disowned and bullied for being bisexual. I also grew up in a very catholic area, and probably wouldn’t be accepted by my community as well. 

2016-2018

Now onto 7th grade. 

7th grade was a huge change for me. It was the start of middle school. This was a much bigger school, and much bigger workload. There were so many kids, and I don’t like crowds. Luckily I had classes with my friends, and my elementary school bullies disappeared. I also had a massive crush on a guy in one of my classes, and this didn’t help. My mood swings also started getting much worse, and I started harming myself. Truthfully, I also believe this is when my depression really kicked in, but it wasn’t diagnosed until recently so.. 

8th grade was bad. I had classes with my friends sometimes, but I also had classes with my elementary school bullies. I had so much anxiety going into those classes but luckily they acted like I didn’t exist and mostly ignored me. I also had the issue of becoming part of a much bigger friend group, there were nearly 20 kids in our group, and my friends became more distant, but luckily I made new friends. These two new friends, J and A, and I became inseparable. We did everything together and told each other everything. 

In the September of 9th grade, I made the mistake of telling them I was bisexual. I also told a few other friends. And they were good about it. J and A were not. J made fun of me, and A mostly ignored it. Until they started telling people. So I had to make a choice. Either tell everyone, or let it be a rumour. I told everyone. Posted it on my social media, and most people were accepting. There were also the people who bullied me too. New people, and a lot of them. I got shoved and tripped a lot. Called a TON of names. J and A were no longer my friends. One day I asked them to hang out during lunch, and I beat the shit out of both of them. I stated harming myself even more. I also started vaping. I still sat with the big group of around 20 kids at lunch, but it was really awkward. So I purposely did stuff to push people away. I blamed a lot of stuff that I did on many people and pushed all of those kids away. 

I then went on a vacation with my family, and as I was driving with my Dad, we noticed a car pulled over. We decided to stop and help out. The old man was having a heart attack. My dad called 911 and told me to do CPR (I had my credentials) and I froze. Completely fucking froze. Paramedics showed up. Man is dead. I could have saved him, and his last breath still haunts me to this day. His face is always in my nightmares. 

That was near the end of the school year. I started harming myself a ton and started having suicidal thoughts. I decided to tell my parents I’m bisexual, I got kicked out for about a week. I lived with my cousin, and I got addicted to weed, and other drugs there, lots of pills. My mom took me back in and said sorry, but she still mostly ignored that I’m bisexual, she doesn’t hate me for it, she just doesn’t mention it. 

July 17. 1st suicide attempt. Slit my thighs, and tried to bleed out in the bath. Mom found me. Diagnosed with Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and Attention Deficit. 

August 20. Swallowed a shit ton of pills. Had to get my stomach pumped 

September something. Tried to jump out of a moving car and missed the concrete pillar I was aiming for. 

The next few months went by pretty uneventful, I started harming myself less. My drug problem got worse 


2019

My drug addiction got really bad in March. I came to school high or drunk nearly every day, and the drugs were messing with my anti depressants. I finally stopped cutting in March. I realized I needed to change. I quit ALL DRUGS AND ALCOHOL FOREVER on April 22nd. I gave myself two strikes and I’m out. I used one of these strikes recently when one of my friends tried to kill himself and I couldn’t cope. So one more time and I’m off the wagon. 

After I quit, everything got better. My mental health improved a lot. I feel good now. I feel mentally stable. I’m able to get up in the morning and I feel like I’m worth something. 

So here’s the moral. No matter how deep you dig yourself, you’re eventually gonna pop out on the other side. It will get better. I care for every single person who is going through problems and I urge you to PM me. I’d love to help you. I love every single one of you and I hope you got something out of my story. Don’t be afraid to share yours. 

TLDR I went through a ton of shit and it gets better",11Aug2019,6
9,"I no longer hang out with the few people who tolerate my time. My best friend has completely checked out in his own nihlistic world-view, fueled by an unchecked depression, that he refuses to seek help for. 

I have not been with a woman in 2 years, and stopped dating, feeling I have nothing to offer anyone. I also have come to the conclusion that I am still in love with the one woman I've ever actually genuinely loved, and wanted to marry. I've done everything I can to move on: date, fuck, drink, drugs, therapy, delete all social media, become a workaholic, travel, isolate myself, etc... I have no hope in rekindling, and I am accepting of this. I wish her nothing but the best, and she always has me in her corner.

My therapist is essentially an emotional punching bag. I had a lot of loss around the time of my ex leaving me. One: a close, long time friend and confidant. She died of an overdose while trying to rehabilitate. The other: my mother. A rare form of cancer took her at a rapid pace. I spent one of two weeks prior to her death in a mental health facility due to a suicide attempt. I checked out when my dad came to visit and said she got worse. I spent a week watching my mother turn into a husk while black death poured out of her mouth.

I've had a rollercoaster with meds. I think I've found a balance, but I'm still depressed. I can't bring myself to participate or do things I enjoy. 

I just want to leave everything and move to another country. I'm not delusional in thinking this is an answer or a potential out for me. The thought is relieving. 
I no longer drink. I occasionally have an edible to sleep. I don't ingest any other substances. I've recently purchased LSD. I don't want to take it recreationally. I want to learn or change my perspective. In my 20s I frequently ate psychedelic mushrooms. But the edification was only derived from horrible experiences towards the end of my use. 

I want to have a positive experience. I want to be a positive being. Enthusiastic about waking up. I want to find pleasure in my creative projects and pleasure in being with people again.

Sorry. I'm lost. I just needed to vent, I guess.",11Aug2019,138
10,"I've been using weed for about a year now every couple weeks, with consistent dosage and strain (edibles), but for some reason I have been getting worse lately. I have been becoming increasingly more paranoid, have more auditory hallucinations, and am having delusions while high. I kind of thought this was normal for the ""high experience"" but now I'm not so sure. When I'm sober I have these symptoms sometimes, but they usually aren't strong enough for me to act on or believe in them. Recently, they've been getting stronger. I talked to my psychiatrist about it because last time I got high I believed I was dead. I don't want to get into detail because it is really distressing. I believed this for about a day, but it keeps coming up while sober.  


My psychiatrist told me to stop using weed, which was a shock to me for some reason. I didn't think it was that big of a deal, I thought he would tell me to use less or to switch strains or something. I've spoken to doctors about psychosis before (before I started using weed), but they never really took it seriously because I had enough insight to know things were not true/real.   


He mentioned that because of my family history I could have a vulnerability to psychosis. I'm on antipsychotics (3+ years), but I thought these were just for my treatment-resistant depression. I haven't been diagnosed with anything related to psychosis (to my knowledge), but now I'm really worried. Is the weed the cause of all these troubles, or do I have an underlying problem that weed exasperates? Does anybody else have similar experiences?",11Aug2019,3

12,"I don’t think this is triggering but wanted to add a warning just in case.
Sorry for the length of the post.


For warning, I’m not writing this post for attention or a pat on my back... I’m writing this post because I want to shed light on a topic that I get a lot of criticism about from family, friends, and people I have crossed paths with in every day life.

I used to self-harm, I struggled with anorexia at times, binging and bulimia at other times. I was in a constant state of self-loathing. I absolutely hated myself. I was always comparing myself to other people, I never measured up. I was never good enough. I went on in this cycle of self-hatred for over three years before I reached out for help. When I reached out everyone assumed it was for attention, they didn’t acknowledge the fact that I hid it for so long. They just thought I was being an attention whore. So I started pretending like I was magically cured. When in reality I was more dead inside at that point in time than I had ever been. I started trying to get myself committed because honestly I felt safer there than anywhere else. I felt understood and for once I felt like I mattered. But every time I had to leave it the hospital and all of my friends I had made... It was like I delved deeper and deeper into that dark cave of depression.  

Nobody wanted to help me through it, nobody wanted to try to understand,  nobody wanted to talk about it or even look me in the eyes. 
They just wanted to throw more pills at me and hope it would be fixed by morning. It never did.

I had given up completely and tried to kill myself. 
I was taken to the hospital and once I was cleared I was taken to a behavioral health center where I stayed a few days and was discharged to the care of a therapist who was really really sweet.
She made me feel at ease and always knew what I needed to hear or what I was having a hard time with at the time.

With the combination of therapy and anti-depressant + anti-anxiety meds, my depression got more and more manageable. I was getting out of bed, I was going outside... I felt alive for the first time in years. With my depression under control, me and my therapist started working on getting my self destructive behavior under control. I eventually stopped self-harming after many hard months and many relapses. Don’t think that I still don’t have days where I want to cut again or that I don’t have days where I question my existence... cause I do. I’m not immune to the struggles, I’m just better equipped to handle them.  

Now brings me to the point of this post. 
I don’t hide my self harm scars. Now when everyone sees them they think I’m not covering because I’m hungry for attention which is never the case. I am the kind of  person who prefers to not be the center of attention, I’m very shy and have social anxiety so talking isn’t my forte. 
However,  when someone asks me if I’m ashamed of them... 
something in me arises and I look them in the eye and with confidence I say... 
I wear my scars with confidence, not because I’m longing for sympathy or a pat on the back... but because they show where I’m coming from, they show my past struggles, the battles I have fought and have come out the victor, they are a reminder of the times life thought it had me knocked out but I got back up kicking and screaming, they tell stories about how I walked through hell and back and survived... So no, I’m not ashamed of my scars. They are my battle scars. Each one tells a different story and there isn’t a single story in my life that I would erase because they have shaped me into the person I am today. 

So to the person who came through my checkout line at the grocery store... I am not ashamed. I am not ashamed of my past or who I am at this moment in time.

I do not cover my arms... because I am a different person. I finally love me(most of the time). I am confident in my skin. I do not need to cover up or change myself. 

I am a survivor. I want other people who have or do struggle with self harm to see that it’s okay, the pain, the sadness, the self hatred, it doesn’t last forever. Eventually you will see better days. So be who you are. Don’t let anyone still your sparkle.

Don’t give up
Don’t back down
Love yourself
And always
BE YOU!",11Aug2019,2

I’ve known that I have mental problems since I was about 12, and got antidepressants from my regular doctor. I have since been taken off of them, for various reasons. I haven’t been doing well, to put it lightly. I suspect I have bipolar disorder, even though I was being treated for depression/anxiety. I had a very bad experience with hospitalization in the past.

15,"2 years ago, I cooked with oil for the first time. Deep frying. My mother had never fried anything besides bacon, so I thought it was supposed to boil like water. No thermometer. 

After the house filled with smoke and it wasn't boiling, I decided to scrap the idea of frying my food.

Google, what do you do with hot oil? I didn't want my cat to get hurt. I threw it outside like Google said. Google doesn't know how to cook. Wind blew. I got 18% of my body. Nothing in my face or groin. Got 2 trips to the burn unit, months of PT, 9 donor grafts, and an auto graft. 

I cooked when I was healed. Mostly beef, but someone else had to drain it. The sizzling startles me... The ground was wet when I got burned.


Months later, not much cooking besides chili (someone cooked for me due to work+baby). I'm coooking mac and cheese as I type this. This is my trigger tonight. 

Too much water boiled away (pre noodle). I get a measuring cup and add more. Water drips down the side. It sizzles onto the burner, I jumped. I readjusted the pot and got that over with. 

Then the steam was hot. Obviously. I didn't want to waste a cooking spoon, so I used a regular spoon. Steam is hot. It's scary.

21,"My husband confessed to me two nights ago that he thought he was unfaithful to me three weeks ago. He claimed that he didn’t remember until a few nights before when he had a flashback of a woman giving him a bj at a bar bathroom, but he couldn’t remember talking to her, who she was, what she looked like, how they got there, anything. It didn’t make any sense, and I didn’t believe that he didn’t remember anything about the situation. 
He has a history of anxiety, and has been showing more and more signs of bipolar disorder and has been drinking way too much for probably about 6-7 months. 
After his confession he has stopped drinking and started going to AA, but it’s only been two days. 
So, today he keeps trying to piece the night together, and in what seemed like a manic state to me, decides he has to go to the bar and get video footage because he’s convinced he has not actually done anything and it was all a figment of his imagination. 
There is no video footage, however, I spoke with the bar owner who was also there that night, and the bartender my husband had (name was on receipt), and they both say nothing happened. In fact, there was a very large birthday party for a gay man, so there were barely any women at the bar at all. 
I don’t even know what to believe. It would be so out of character for him to have been unfaithful, but he was definitely black out drunk. I can’t believe he would confess to something unless it happened, but he has also been telling me for a few weeks that he has had a hard time distinguishing dreams from reality (he said this before this incident happened). 
Anyway, is this even possible? Can he be a functional person but also be in such a bad mental place that his brain makes up situations like this and he doesn’t know what’s real? I don’t have these particular  mental health issues so even though it’s unbelievable to me, I don’t know if maybe it’s possible?
I don’t want to just be the naive wife, so I’m turning to y’all to give me thoughts. 
And yes, he obviously needs help with all of this either way. He has been waiting for an appointment with a psychiatrist for almost two months (it’s this coming Tuesday) and he has already committed to being in AA and also going to counseling.",11Aug2019,1

I’ve always had a habit of biting my nails since I was a kid. As I got older it was more connected to my anxiety, but recently I’ve been picking at my fingernails and toenails so much it’s been causing me physical pain. I’ll try to clip my toenails and notice one is out of place and completely fuck up my foot. I have given myself multiple ingrown toenails, and small infections (red/irritated/painful)...my feet are disgusting though - in my opinion. I’ll also pluck hairs that don’t need to necessarily be plucked. Right now I have a nice ingrown hair on my bikini line too. I feel so unattractive and stuck.

33," 

Dear mom,

You don’t know, and it breaks my heart that I can’t allow you yet to love me more because I might scare you. Do you remember one time I got terribly sick, quivering with cold sweats? You woke up and whispered, “Stop doing that. You are scaring me.” You are so brave.

One Saturday morning I went to an HIV hub and got myself tested out of curiosity. That the rapid increase of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)[ cases](https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/217903-numbers-global-hiv-aids-cases) among males here made me anxious, but knowledge is more empowering, I thought.

I was confused when the counselor told me I got a reactive status. I hadn’t shown any terrible symptoms we saw on some sensationalist dramas. My awareness on HIV and Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is thorough. Most of all, I have never remembered a recent unprotected sexual encounter, except for my ex-boyfriend who is HIV-negative, and a very few guys 10 years ago.

I couldn’t help but ask, “Sir J, when shall I die? Can I join you for lunch?”

Sir J sighed and said my imagination on HIV being a death sentence is far from what’s really happening.

The 3 of us ate at the nearest eatery. With their low voices, they told me to think of my next phase as a form of self-care, not as a survival mechanism. When we’re done, Sir J offered to pay the bill for us.

My dark, self-deprecating humor set in, so I said, “You won’t let me pay my meal and my fare because I will die soon.” They didn’t laugh.

Mom, that day was overwhelming for me that I went back to the hub and joked to them about how my life was a wreck: that I might be fired from my job; that my ex-boyfriend whom I still love might stop talking to me once I disclose this to him; that my virus will sever my dreams of going abroad, my wish to be a triathlete, and my quest to find someone who will love me.

Sir J and Ma’am A reassured me that people living with HIV now are leading healthier lives, and my overthinking isn’t helping me. Besides, even if the test is very accurate, the confirmatory result from the laboratory can only declare my being HIV-positive.

Sir J stalked my Facebook account and came across your picture with dad. You took me back to childhood, Mom, and suddenly I wailed and hyperventilated, my face buried on Sir J’s shirt.

He embraced me, told me it’s okay, and said, “Do you want to know a secret? I have the virus too. But now I’m undetectable.” He showed to me the bottle of antiretroviral (ARV) pills inside his bag.

I held his hand and thanked him for letting me know I am not alone, but he needed to leave me to attend to some clients. I just needed to cry it all out and compose myself so you wouldn’t see a trace of pain as I arrived home.

My ex-boyfriend once visited our house, but you knew him as my friend. We lasted for many years, in spite of me being away from him and being a cheat. You sometimes ask where he works now, because of all my friends who had dropped by my house, he hadn’t come back. I assure you he is by far the kindest, most tender, most fragrant person I know. And I will not replace him as my best friend.

Against my peer counselors’ advice (they told me it’s safer that I would only tell this to one person, and that’s you), I told him everything. I joined him in the hub where I was tested, because the one nearest to him was reported to have rumor-mongering counselors.

He tested negative, Mom. He had moved on with someone else too.

We hadn’t talked since and I felt pushed away, but to be seen by him was my greatest privilege.

One Sunday morning, I saw Sir L, one of the peer counselors in the hub. He said he only had two hours of sleep because of his schedule. He paused and said, “By the way, the laboratory sent us your confirmatory results already.”

“So HIV-positive, huh?” I expected for the worst, but wished for him to say another.

He nodded.

“Can I see the paper tomorrow?” I had no plans on knowing my body was in shambles. I just wanted to sound unaffected.

“Sure.” He offered me water and bread, but I refused and walked home.

The new reality was something I can’t handle, so I went home not meeting your eyes. I sulked in my room the entire day, both lightheaded and wanting to vomit.

The walls of my room separated your oblivion from my depression, Mom. It’s a dark place in here. It’s embarrassing to admit I had often thought of ending myself. I had known abandonment too well, and I had known debilitating isolation too.

With all the precarities I had grown, I never claimed to dare greatly at this. But it sometimes surprises me to not betray myself by choosing courage.

You would’ve been proud if you knew [my first essay on HIV](https://opinion.inquirer.net/122133/a-day-in-the-life-of-an-hiv-poz-25) had saved lives and forged strong bonds among HIV-positives, and even HIV-negatives who have nonetheless suffered almost the same sadness as mine. We both could have drowned in the anonymous display of love and prayers my new friends had offered.

The world has its way of surprising me too. I see how nourishing the world is when I wake up without discomfort from flu. I see beauty on the sidewalk when a blind street musician continues playing with a friend assisting him. I see hope with every news on HIV research. I see self-worth as I share my insights to my friends, bright-eyed and nodding.

I can’t wait to be ready to tell everything to you, Mom. I’m excited to tell you what I have read on one AIDS survivor with only one CD4 count but is now healthy because of effective treatment. I’d be clear on explaining to you what it means to be [undetectable](https://www.avert.org/living-with-hiv/antiretroviral-treatment/what-does-undetectable-mean), and I'm leaning towards that.

I didn't wait for a year to be an HIV activist, because in one way or another, I had advanced the cause through writing. I would like you to visit the hub and get to know the people who have helped me cope with the disease.

Despite all these favors, I can’t promise to get any better. There are still times I shrink and hurt myself. But I believe I am enough, Mom, and that’s enough.

Sincerely,

Your son

I recently transferred to university as well as got married to my best friend, which is awesome! However, this university is about 3hrs out and I can't do hardly any of my courses online due to lab/fieldwork requirements. So, I'm moving closer to school and I'm experiencing even more depressive episodes and now baby anxiety attacks. I'm excited to be continuing my education, and I know people have to deal with long distance relationships all the time, but damn. I want to cry everytime I think about it, and the date just keeps getting closer and closer. I cant stop thinking about how hard it's going to be not being able to see my favorite person everyday, not even hug them...

Fortunately, my husband has been amazingly supportive and understanding with all of this. We're planning to use our weekends to see each other, and that should help a little. Plus smartphones have video chat now I guess, so I can give that a whirl. But still. I'm so afraid I won't be strong enough to handle this. I've never considered myself physically or emotionally strong, and yet I'm trying this of all things. If anyone has any suggestions on handling ones mental health in situations like this please free to let me know. 💚 



Tdlr: starting a long distance relationship with my husband due to college. How do I cope?

Note: all universities in my area are several hours out except one, but the program I need is really bad there. They do a lot of shady shit so-to-speak and they're way more expensive.",11Aug2019,1
35,"Im 19, trans guy, fumbling around college (i like lab work, and Im trying to figure out what type of science i might like to study).  Ive got a close friend. Im kind of nerdy, and ive never had a relationship. Not really good at spending time at one thing. Ive not been diagnosed with adhd or anything, but everyone suspects that I have it. workout. Stopped taking anti depressants almost  a year ago. I had a job this summer. Didnt go well. I got super anxious and didnt feel safe around my coworkers. I quit.

 I dont love anyone. I dont know why. I love my mom. We have some rough patches. I dont know how our relationship is going to come out in the end. Conversion therapy + years of repression have marked me in ways i cannot express. Last night, i had a dream my highschool principal was sacrificing me to God. I woke up sweating. I havent been there in almost 2 years.

Most days things go right. It feels a little too easy. Considering how hard life was before, and how little it's all actually changed. 

Ive got a lovely little life. But it doesnt feel like my life. Theres nothing pushing me forward, other than my dispassionate curiosity. 

Life feels like a bunch of patterns. Lots of strings connected to each other. That's all it is. Strings connecting things to other things. Nothing is actually it's own thing. Im almost convinced the world isnt real. Like there's a hidden world below the surface of this world. We cant touch it. I know this is all nonsense logically. But that's what I think. I sit and look at my cat and think of every fiber in him, and what makes him him and what makes me me. When i go longboarding, I can't help but blur the lines between me, the road, the board and the wind.

Its like, if I squint, I'll see how blurry the world is. How un real it is. No one matters. I dont matter. Im just connections. Atoms mashing into each other- empty space- a wave across time. A mere note in the symphony of the universe. I am nothing. It doesnt bother me, but it makes me wonder if I'll ever experience life like a normal human being. I feel so distant from everyone. I don't like it. I want to be present, and I can be, but I can't help but see the connections as I live in the moment.

I'm partially convinced that everyone I talk to is an illusion.  Thats half true. My perception of my friends isnt my friends identity, and I created a false understanding of them. I cannot truly know my friends. Maybe they arent real and one day I'll realize ive been screaming at a bunch of rocks. Regardless, I listen to their problems. When they ask me about my problems, I don't know my own. I also struggle to share them.

Im fully capable of functioning. I have high marks in university. I have maintained two friends for 6 years. i thoroughly enjoy working with animals, and despite this i am rather more of an extrovert. I just wish I understood the need for material objects, for love, for passion better. I want to feel human because i don't right now.",11Aug2019,1

38,"Just a disclaimer, I don't think I've ever had a serious mental health issue - just that maybe I'm emotionally weak or dramatic or unable to handle life because I've been so sheltered?

But I think I remember after puberty sometime, I went through an existential crisis, and being anxious that something bad would happen at any given moment. I also had a lot of obsessive compulsions? It might have had something to do with the fact that my grandmother at the time was passing away, but I think I was always kind of an anxious / obsessive / perfectionist kid growing up.

My parents told me to suck it up and I didn't want to upset them (also another compulsion). So I started mindlessly watching YouTube for hours just to stop thinking. 

Everything started dying down little by little as I learned how to cope by myself and as I just got so tired of everything. I reasoned that if things were going to happen, then there was nothing I could do to stop them from happening. Sometimes I just felt very down or irritated, enough so that my teachers noticed and occasionally asked if I was alright. I never really noticed it at the time though and thought I was just having bad days.

But when I started taking all higher level courses later on, I feel that my anxious thoughts translated to school instead. I finally was free of all my compulsions (mostly) but started really obsessing about school. Sometimes I'd find someway to punish myself because I was so angry with myself for not studying or not turning in an assignment. I procrastinated, but I tried so so hard to get straight A's. My anxiety and obsession calmed down near the end of high school. I almost stopped caring until right before my major exams came at the end of the school year - where I freaked out and started cramming again. 

During summer, I still was very nervous and freaking out about registration three months away for college courses. Even when I did register, I obsessed over whether or not I made the same choices. 

My motivation level and anxiety level seriously plummeted throughout the school year. I try to force myself into caring but I honestly can't. I know how important school is to me but I can't seem to start my homework. I spend hours everyday scrolling through the internet, and what's worse is that I really enjoy it. I try to feel guilty or develop discipline, but I can't. I try to punish myself, but I just don't care. I get irritated whenever my family tells me to go do something else, like go out, or take care of myself because I feel like I should be doing homework, but I let myself procrastinate anyways. I just have no motivation anymore and can't seem to care about anything anymore. 

Is it possible to heal in the wrong way after some kind of mental health crisis? Has anyone else gone through something like this?",11Aug2019,10

40,"Hello, Idk how to start this, I guess I’ll say I’m 21, have diagnosed GAD, Panic Disorder, SAD, Manic Depression, BPD (borderline personality) and know I have other things yet to be diagnosed (soon as I start therapy in a few weeks, the last doctor I saw suspected I also have bipolar depression, schizophrenia and a few others just to give you a general idea of what’s up there) I take 300mg of wellbutrin/bupropion a day, and have for a year and a half, I don’t even notice any side effects anymore. I was trying to fall asleep tonight and all of a sudden felt electric shocks throughout my whole body kinda like lightening or like being electrocuted, I could feel myself shaking and tried to move but hardly could at all, I opened my eyes to try and find my dog to try and get her to help or do anything and saw nothing but black, but the tv is on so it wasn’t dark at all, also I could hear it but just barely and I had to really focus to which was pretty much impossible. I could hardly think at all which is unusual, I overthink literally everything. Not knowing whatever was happening I panicked and had an anxiety attack, I have no idea what that was or what happened but I’m terrified to try and sleep again.. the closest thing I can find online is “brain zaps” but it was through my whole body really intensely not just my head, and almost everything i find is saying something about SSRI withdrawal but I haven’t taken any SSRI’s in about a year, (wellbutrin/bupropion is an NDRI) I wasn’t feeling intense anxiety either until it all of a sudden started.

42,"i’ve been diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder and anxiety for 4 years now, so i’m not asking this not understanding what depression feels like. 

my friend will send me messages about how terrible she feels on occasion. and she always makes it sound really bad and won’t talk to me about it. ik she used to self harm pretty badly and has suicidal thoughts a lot, so it stresses me the fuck out. 

about 90% of the time i text her about something, she’ll completely ignore whatever i say beforehand to say what she wants to. this happens even when what i said is really important. and when she does acknowledge it, it’s very short. i don’t know if she’s doing it bc she doesn’t care or bc she’s depressed and is too focused on that to pay attention to me.

but it’s hard for me to think that she doesn’t care, even if evidence shows that. we write together, and in a little over a year, we have written over 100k in writing. someone who doesn’t care doesn’t do that. 

the main reason she makes me anxious as hell is that she ghosts for days at a time after sending messages about how bad she feels. i can rarely see her in person, so i have no idea how she is. she’ll come back days later like nothing happened, saying her parents took her phone. i have no doubt that they do sometimes, but she’ll also ghost when i know she has her phone, and it hurts when i know that. i don’t know if i’m being clingy by worrying when she doesn’t text me back the same day- im trying not to be.

it also feels like i can’t be upset with her about anything. the main thing causing me to make this post was actually her completely screwing me over in a game (yes it’s a game, but we had promised to 100% be on each other’s sides and i had stayed true to that). honestly it wasn’t that upsetting, but i was mad in the moment. plus she gave some bullshit excuse. i left the game since i died at the very beginning bc she killed me. we were on vc since it’s rare to meet face to face, so i didn’t talk for a while. a few minutes later she hangs up and says her parents were yelling at her and hasn’t talked to me since- i heard her parents whenever they talked to her on vc, so i’m calling bs. almost feels like she’s guilt tripping me and that i can’t ever be upset w her.

she always gives excuses for not responding to things or for not acknowledging what i have to say, and i don’t know if it’s the truth or not. on one hand, it makes me feel super clingy since i’m anxious about how she is. but in the other, it really makes me feel insignificant since she’ll just text whatever she has to say even if i was opening up to her about something serious. or she’ll turn the conversation into something about her. 

i guess bottom line is, is she manipulative or am i just sensitive/clingy? and if she is, is she doing it purposefully or bc of depression? and id like advice on how to confront her and get her to change this behavior (being ignored/made to feel not important is a trigger from childhood so it hits hard) without hurting her?",11Aug2019,1

45,"  I grew up in a middle class household in the Philippines and had attended into a Catholic private school. Our daily routine had went from 8AM-4PM with a total of 6 core classes (This specific schedule had started when I was in 1st Grade I believe). I was raised mainly by grandma as my Mom and Dad had worked overseas. My Grandma is a sweet woman, she truly is, she always cared about what what made me happy and honestly helped me have fun through out the stressful constraints of this hellish schedule. The schedule by itself had really affected me, in which my social abilities were lacking and my overall self - awareness plummeted as all my energy was focused on always making my family proud of making it to the honor rolls (Our school had an annual event celebrating the highest GPA’s in each class passing certificates and medals, of which I had only been able to get a bronze.)

   Fast forward to when I turn twelve, my mother decides it’d be best if move there with her in a rural town near Chicago where a lot of her friends live. We didn’t actually have a home there, instead we lived in my mother’s friend’s house for roughly about a year. My Mom and Dad always fought, because soon I later found out that my mom had gone crazy that my dad added a girl on facebook that she didn’t recognize. This petty quarrel went on for weeks, being stuck with grown adults in a random stranger’s house who are screaming over facebook really affects someone. This didn’t help the fact that I was new to a foreign land that I had no one to guide me with and no similarities with any other people around here.

  We ultimately decided to move down a bit far from Chicago, where we lived in a motel for about two months, then switched back to a Super 8 Hotel. These locations were always enclosed, one room suites which had always made it impossible for me to cry myself to sleep when I knew that things would get worse from here. Not much happened until we moved into an apartment in quite a rural area in which for about two years had been my most scarring moments as a child. Seeing my mother strike my dad with a frying pan to the ribs, watching my dad’s mental state deteriorate into a sad, desperate attempt to comfort me, seeing my Dad break his own laptop after what was basically a mental breakdown. It was only for the best that my Dad had moved up to Seattle, where he got a job as a dishwasher, providing what little he could provide while also giving himself his own leisure time.

  Of course, as soon as my dad had moved my mom started to talk to me about how lazy he was, how much of a slob he was. She always talked to me about how he was in an affair and wanted to “abandon” the family. My dad in the meanwhile who had called me was always sobbing in the phone, talking about how much he loved my mom and how much he missed me. Both of these combined didn’t sit well with young 13 year old me, and seeing as how my Dad had now moved I had to keep care of my little brother and do chores around the house. One particular evening was when my mother had went out with excessive makeup and lipstick on and told me that she was going to go out with her friends that evening. Of course that was a fucking lie, she decided to sneak out and have an affair of her own using my time up keeping care of the house and keeping an eye on my little brother while she decides to think that this was fair. I found this out after the man’s WIFE had directly messaged my father taking screenshots of both of their conversations with each other. I soon heard about this and learned that the mother herself was now single and having to take care of four kids after this asshole had divorced her and just left in search of another woman.

  I felt betrayed and used, I felt like my only use to her was to make sure that SHE gets what she wants, it’s all about her and not about us anymore. I contemplated running away from home, looked up details of the nearest Amtrak and the most cost - efficient ways to spend what few dollars I had lying around. I even went as far as to stack up on canned food and pre-made sandwiches in my backpack, waiting for an opportunity. Of course, this just never happens, too scared to do it, too scared of the aftermath. My mother saw my mental health deteriorating and did nothing but scrutinize me for such behavior. This again added to my low self esteem and overall addition to my already unhealthy lifestyle

  Here we are at present day, where I moved down South because once again, my mom has a college friend here. (These people are actually really hospitable and it’s honestly got nothing to do with them). I later figured out that during the summertime before we had actually moved out here that while I had taken my one-person trip back to the Philippines, my mother had once again kept meeting the same man I had stated two years back. My little brother would always tell me stories of this man in a Black Cadillac that my mother would be with, he’d always refer to him as ‘Guapo’ which was the cute little nickname my mother had given him. How cute it is ruining two families’ all for the sake of your lustful desires... Right?

  Anyways, I’m the new kid in the block now, my Dad now went back to the old habit of smoking and drinking and my Mom hasn’t said that she loves me since my birthday which was about 4 months ago. My mental health is unhealthy and I do notice that. I’ve taken steps to begin my weight loss routine and I’m actually quite social now surprisingly. I’m not an edgy teenager, I just want to live a life with a happy family and some good old friends. I understand my situation isn’t as severe as others, but I just want people to recognize me as a person, not a statistic. Always have my counselors refer to my problems as a statistic, never addressing the root of the problem. I hope to overcome these challenges soon mentally and both physically, Have a good rest of your day.",11Aug2019,1
46,"I just learned in my 30s that I’m bipolar. I remember going through a serious mental breakdown in my early 20s, but I honestly didn’t realize I was bipolar. But I got PTSD from assisting a coworker who got seriously injured and it set off a series of rapid highs and lows. I had another breakdown and my boss made me talk to a bunch of head shrinks and I got diagnosed.

I’ve been on an antidepressant, Escitalopram, for about 4 months. My psychiatrist suggested lithium but I talked with my doctor about trying to avoid something I thought was so harsh. 

I haven’t been sleeping well for about 2 weeks now. I am up late and can’t fall asleep, but when I do, I have these extremely vivid and lucid dreams that last forever in the span of like 4 hours that I manage to sleep. In the dreams, I have all these memories and interactions.... but then I wake up and I’m trying to figure out all these emotions I’m feeling from the dreams. The dreams feel so real and awake feels so fake. Its hard to determine what’s real and what’s not. How can I be sure this isn’t a dream when this is like my dreams and my dreams are like this? I’m not constantly in a state of confusion, but sometimes I forget that this is all real and it’s not a dream. Then I’m dreaming and I can’t be sure it’s not real. 

Is this a bipolar thing? Or a medication thing? I’ve been trying to avoid talking with my doctor because I don’t want to spook her into doping me up on something that’ll make me slow and fat",11Aug2019,3

I've let people who had nothing, life in fucking shambles, move in with me so they had a place and they could get things straight. Fucked me over every time. Go beyond what I ever should to help my ""friends"" whether I'm working with them or just hanging out. Literally get used every fucking time by every person that can fucking use me. Constantly, constantly the butt of every fucking joke that could ever be said. People think I'm weird. Every fucking person I seem to meet. I have fucking anxiety. I have a hard goddamn time starting conversations. Like give me a fucking chance please. I don't even do anything anymore. It's not even worth it. Why the fuck should I waste my time trying to meet people when this is the only goddamn reaction I get every time. I literally cant seem to get a gf cause I'm not constantly throwing punches and being loud as fuck. Got called gay last night cause I was hanging out with some people and I didn't want to get in a sand pit and fucking fight club brawl with some dude. Get made fun of a work constantly. Like I actually try. At whatever fucking job I have. Doesn't matter what it is. And I get made fun of for actually giving a fuck. Or cause people think I'm gay. Fucking seriously. Like I've seen people  who have tons of gay friend's, even hanging out with them, and make fun of me because they think I'm gay. If I wasn't such a pussy I would have killed myself along time ago. But I have the actual fucking depressing thought that my life will eventually get better. I know it won't. But I still fucking believe it will. I will always be left behind.

52,"I read a post on Instagram (from tumblr) and it was talking about giving freedom to your kids and making a safe environment for them to feel able to talk to you about stuff.

I felt as though my mum half did that, as I feel open to talk to her about some things. But I just don’t feel as though I can with a lot of things. Like my sexuality, my incredibly low self esteem,  how I considered suicide last year (I’m ok Rn though), etc bc I thought she’d laugh at me.

I love my mum, she gives me freedom to be able to do what I want as long as it’s safe for me and other people, and she gives me attention, I just don’t think she has a proper grip on the fact that her children can have mental health issues or anxiety. It’s weird bc she’s a teacher, she knows what a panic attack looks like, she knows what low self esteem looks like, but not on her own children.

But then it comes to my father. I hate him, I can’t talk to him about anything without him saying how it’s my fault or if I keep on talking like that no one will like me. He shows no interest in what I do. He doesn’t care what I do. I was home alone with my dad for a week when I was ten and I had to cook every night because he couldn’t cook. He never makes an effort and now that it’s obvious I don’t want to associate with him he’s trying to get my attention and talk to me BUT I CANT DO THAT WITHOUT HIM MAKING ME FEEL BAD!!!!! 

For example, I’m very strong in science history and music (random subjects I know they’re just what I’m best at), and I mention I had a science exam today, my dad asks how I went, and I said “oh I think I went really well! And my friends said that they think I would’ve done good as well” and not even a good job, or that’s great. Noooo it was “If you keep on talking like that you’ll sound cocky and no one likes a cocky person! You’ll end up with no friends” 

AND JUST UGH 

My parents fight all the time! Like not one day without a screaming match and I just want them to divorce so it’ll be over but then the next second they’re talking civilly! And I just feel like they aren’t as afffectionate as the used to be.

The only problem I see with them divorcing is what’ll happen to my three dogs?? How is my mum gonna make enough money to support her me and my sister (she’s a teacher at a special needs school), and just amughhhhhhhh",11Aug2019,5
53,"Hello all, I'm not too sure what to say. I would love to think perhaps I'm just unhappy right now. It started about a 3 months or so ago. I would like to start out by saying I left home as soon as I could and moved in with a life-long friend when I was 19, I am now 21. I was happy for the past 2 years, not really all smiles and everything but happy to live a life from what I was doing before which was playing games all day and buying make up. Anyways, about 3 months ago I changed I guess? I started to not feel like my normal self, I was depressed, nothing made me really smile or laugh etc. My friend told me it was just my period which I had started 2 days before these feeling appeared, but my period never affects me after really espically not for months . I tried being more active, going to the gym and watching what I eat, it helped a bit but I was still unhappy and after a month or more of going almost every day I stopped. My friend has since took notice of me being unhappy and has tried to be more helpful, she makes sure I eat, try to sleep and overall she really hates seeing me sad and she truly tries to take care of me because I don't want to really anymore. Since these feeling I stopped sleeping for long periods of time, I dont enjoy wanting to sleep, I don't enjoy food or even video games anymore. I simply read a book and try to escape which only brings me on the verge of more unhappiness. I simply am unsure as of what to do anymore. This tearing my life apart. I live in USA, Alaska.

I'm not looking for sorrys. I just want help, please.",11Aug2019,1
54,"    I'm very concerned because my mother has been acting very strange and impulsive for quite some time, even more so lately, and as of today, it was brought to my attention that she's been saying strange things such as the reason she enjoys going to the balcony outside of our home so much is because she enjoys ""listening to the tree frogs."" We live in the United States, so this is highly unlikely, if not impossible, for her to encounter those in our area. 
     Before this incident, she also has had a tendency in the past to make grunting noises like she's hurt and say things like "" No Satan. You have no power over me"" and make other argumentative statements directed towards the devil when she seems upset or stressed out. She claims she is speaking in tongues when she does this, but I've never witnessed others act this way when they've spoken in tongues at church services. (Pentecostal Christians will know what I'm referring to). 
     She has always been bad with money for as long as I can remember, and tends to make decisions based off of emotions rather than logic. For example, when my father was offered disability money and had to use a portion to give her back child support (long story), she used that money to buy a car just a few years newer than the one she had despite the fact that her old one still worked well, and she has a lot of student loan debt and other bills that are more important.
    Since my sister and I graduated high school, my mom has developed the attitude that she should not work while she is finishing up her college, claiming that school is more important, and God will ""bless her with a job"" when she graduates. She is paying rent with leftover loan money from school. She also has the same attitude about meeting new men, claiming that she won't have to find the right one, God will find him for her. (She has never went on a single date since my parent's divorce, despite the fact that it occurred years ago, and my dad has moved on). 
     Another concerning behavior of hers is that she has a tendency of getting very argumentative for several days, and then on rare occasions, this will be followed up by what I call one of her infamous ""blow ups"" for lack of a better phrase. During one blow up, she pushed my sister down and then slammed the door shut because she said she wanted to move out. During another one, my mom threatened to punch my sister in the face all because my sister was in physical pain from an accident and wanted the couch my mom was sitting on so she lie down comfortably. 
     Most recently, she has developed a weird obsession with the kitten my sister rescued after initially saying that we would adopt her out after she receives proper litter box training and gets vaccinated. She now not only insists on keeping the kitten, but she has been calling apartments that allow pets and seeing if there's one she can move into by September (Nevermind the fact that's less than a month, and most apartments make you wait a month or two unless they happen to have an unoccupied apartment right at that moment, which is kind of rare in my area). She never even discussed the idea of moving with us until my sister caught my mom on one of her calls with an apartment manager. She also freaks out when we bring the kitten to the vet, claiming that it will cause the cat trauma and gets upset if we even so much as suggest putting the cat in its carrier so she can be left unattended safely for a few minutes. 
     So back to the title question: is it possible for my mom to suddenly develop a serious mental illness, or have I just been oblivious to it all these years?  Either way, some advice would be greatly appreciated on how to find help for my mother, seeing as she absolutely refuses to seek therapy for herself.

TLDR: I'm worried because my mom uses Christianity to support her delusions, has claimed to hear animals that aren't even in our area, is financially unstable, has had violent outbursts in the past, and has recently developed an unhealthy obsession with our rescue kitten. Needing advice on how to get help for her because she refuses to go to therapy.",11Aug2019,2
55,"I’m an 18 year old soon to be college student, and for the past 3 years of my life, I’ve gone through spikes of depression. Most of the time it’s not even feelings of sadness, it’s just more like an overwhelming feeling of nothingness? When I’m in a better head and not in a full depressive episode, I can reflect and see clearly how I got to that point, but when I’m in that level it’s like I can’t escape it. I make tons of excuses on why I can’t hang out with friends (or excuses to call online friends) and I’m just tired of it. I know that’s it’s normal to need breaks and times to be alone, but to me, it doesn’t even feel like I want to be alone. It’s more like going outside feels awful, but so does doing nothing. All my favorite games and music that used to make me happy doesn’t anymore and I just have an overwhelming feeling of dissatisfaction with my life. I haven’t felt anything suicidal in quite some time, and I don’t really think that’s what I’m feeling now, but I guess I’m just hoping that one day I can wake up and feel refreshed with myself and my life again.

I have suffered bad with mental health for the majority of my life, this year has been so hard yet I've not faced some of the hardest shit this year that I've had to before and I just dont understand it.

I say that lightly as I've still had a lot to deal with this year, one of my friends killed themselves, a girl I was really into fucked me about and crushed my heart into a million pieces and my dad has been diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer. So even tho it hasn't been the worst shit I've had to deal with I've still got a lot going on and it sucks big time.

My problem is that I feel so numb, against it all.. I have absolutely nothing and it's so scary. 

I planned to kill myself last night, so instead I got so drunk I couldn't physically do it and yet woke up with my body full of cuts and slashes. Obviously decided to hack at myself with a knife instead of killing myself. A knife I can no longer find and am worrying my parents will notice it missing.

I'm currently on a waiting list to speak to a mental health specialist and a therapist but that seems a long way off, and I'm so scared I won't make it till then.

nothing.

I'll go from literally crying, feeling worthless to actually feeling fucking great. I'm literally better then everyone else. Confidence boosts so fucking much. Like bam. I feel GREAT. 

Anything sets my weird changes off. I can go from just chilling to holding a knife to my wrist considering killing myself over a simple frustration. 

Sometimes nothing feels real. Nothing at all. My hands don't feel on my body. This isn't real life. It doesn't feel like it. 

Everything is wack. My week can literally go from me chillin, to getting close to suicide to going out and spending the entire day feeling amazing. In 2 days?

59,"(TL;DR at the bottom)

yesterday, me and my girlfriend (long distance) were talking about Minecraft and getting her nails done, and today she thinks that I haven't wanted anything to do with her for 2 months.

it was around 8 o'clock yesterday when my girlfriend, let's call her C for short, dissociated. she didn't know where she was, but luckily I could tell she was down the street from her house. I guided her home and then we facetimed to make sure she was okay, which she was. she has gone out for some ice cream from the shop, so she was happy.

she then began to ignore my texts, and then I saw this one her story:

""single, depressed, and living my best life"" over a picture of the ice cream and Brooklyn 99.

it terrified me. my heart began to pound and I was shaking. I called her about 4 times before she picked up with a calm, yet dismissive, ""hey.""

she wasnt mad, I could tell, but it wasn't the tone we've had for the past 12 months. we spoke and she told me she was all good always, which of course I didn't believe. and then I asked her about her story and she hung up.

it took a long series of calls and texts to eventually realise she was still dissociating, and that her mind must have made up this story about us breaking up 2 months ago during her GCSEs. her and I are both 16, by the way.

eventually, she fell asleep on the phone to me and I was praying she would remember in the morning, like she normally does.

she didn't.

so now I'm here, begging for help on a subreddit. 

I don't know what to do, she still is adamant we broke up, and doesn't remember even the night before last, where I helped her deal with suicidal thoughts because of her dad.

normally I'm really helpfull with her when she dissociates, but now I don't know what to do. I can't lose her, (in regards of suicide) she needs me, and I need her. she makes me the happiest guy on the world and the. in the flick of a switch were nothing.

63,Hello all. This is my first time posting. I have been taking citalopram for 2 years and a year ago decided to start weaning off. I went super slow as even on the meds I had bad side effects 2 years on. I was on 2.5mg 2 weeks ago and decided enough was enough and stopped taking it. For 4 days I went 1 day on 1 day off and then stopped all together. I felt great for the first 3 days and then started to feel a little ill. Not depressed but went to a family meal feeling great and half way through felt extremely dizzy and then anxious. Last week was great. I felt better and better every day and then on Friday evening started feeling really anxious again. Even yesterday our food shopping got delivered and I felt anxious about that. I'm getting extreanly fed up now and although I feel better than I did a few years back I just want my life back to normal. I feel it all started from a flight with work when I started to feel nauseated and I have a fear of throwing up. I don't know whether to just do it and it will make me feel better again.

70,"Hey there. I've sorta been more realizing some things about myself that others dont have and like sorry if this doesn't..fit here I don't know where else to ask

dunno. not knowing what's going is really taking a toll on me.

for more info, I'm under 18 and never really gone to a doctor or anyone about this stuff

This is tricky to put into words really. I can't.. really seem to explain it. These feelings just feel like no. They feel like no is how I can explain it. 

I can't stand touch. Being touched makes me feel this sudden weird feeling of just feeling like I need to scream or just stop functioning at all

I can't explain it. It's just terrible.

I have to cover my ears when it gets even slightly loud. I cant handle loud stuff. The windows in the car can't be rolled down. On some days even above a whisper feels like no, it's bad I don't like it

some textures aren't good at all like
I can't.. like... The textures feel wrong. I start wanting to scream and just it's so bad it feels wrong, like..
touching dry paper makes me literally tense up and I just feel so so bad and it's a huge no feeling
a lot of textures spring me into a little thing of just no. I can't feel anything but no. I just feel like hiding in the corner and screaming because I can't take how it felt

I often destroy stuff or chew on things I'm not supposed to. Wires. Jackets. Phone cases. It's calming. I have to. I just gotta.

What's going on? I have so many weird things that bother me and it's really confusing me. Please give me a ANSWER if you know. That'd be really helpful.",11Aug2019,9

72,"My best friend has several problems in his head and for so long I was really understanding and kind with him, because I know how he feels, Im not fully okay either.
Since he got rejected from the university he applied to, he stopped drawing or doing any normal things. He spends his days with games and movies and tv shows. He stays up until 3 in the morning and sleeps until 2pm. It would be okay for some weeks, but he is doing it for at least a year now. He attended therapy for 2 weeks and he said He is better, and its not because of the psychologist. He thinks he can solve it alone as everything etc. Because he has anxiety and I think maybe he is depressed. And he has panic attacks, very negative thoughts.

Last night he was sleeping here with me and woke me up because he was near a panic attack so I woke up and tried to comfort him.
I asked him today to attend therapy again, but he says its too expensive and its not working for him. I have to say he is not poor, his parents make a lot of money, but he tries to get enough cash for a brand new PC. (At least he doesnt asks his parents to buy him a new one, he tries to put away the money he gets from them little by little.)

I dont know what to do anymore. I dont want him to get a job or go to school again. I would be happy if he would just do something productive. He is good at so many things, he could easily make videos to yt, because he even know the culture of that site, talking about movies or series. Or painting. I dont know, whatever.

73,"Very recently I (20M) was home alone while my mother quickly went to pick up my uncle, and as soon as she left the driveway a car slowly drove by and I got suspicious. It then parked across out driveway and a man with a mask one came up to the front door, I can see all of this as I was on my PC in my room which is on the first floor facing the street and driveway. At this point I was terrified and instantly tried to call the police. Then all of a sudden 4 more masked men rushed out the car and they all sprinted towards the door. I thought I was going to die I had never been so scared in my life. 

They break through the front door easily, it took them 10 seconds max, and one of them rushed up the stairs and came straight to my room. He threatened me with a knife and told me to hang up the phone and turn everything off. So I did.

He then took the phone and demanded me to show him where my mums gold was. He had the knife up to me this whole time. I tried to show him where it was and the other men followed me. They took all her jewelry and tipped the room upside down. 

They left and I was in shock, never felt like that before. It’s indescribable. Obviously I didn’t have my phone so couldn’t call the police again but luckily my mom arrived just a few minutes after they left. The police came and did what they had to, I have a statement which took 2 hours.

But this whole situation has been replaying over and over in my head and it’s hard to take my mind off how scared I was. And I know this could have been a lot worse but I never expected something like this to happen as we live in a nice area where there are rarely any incidents. I just want to know how I can get over this properly and what to do. If anyone’s been through something similar and has any advice please help",11Aug2019,2

75,"The last two weeks were extremely shit and I don’t know why. I just finally finished my apprenticeship in mid June. Meaning after 3 years of learning I’m now officially a software developer and can expect full pay. I’m 28 so it’s fairly late because I went to uni before and dropped out. So that should be a huge relieve for me. My marks in the finals weren’t to good but enough. It’s a three out of 6 while 1 is perfect and 4 is the minimum to pass. (I life in Germany, just tried to explain the system as short as possible)  I took some time off after my finals. The company I learned at wanted to keep me and they made a good offer so I decided to stay. Nice people, good pay, close to home and the promise to give me opportunity to learn more. I asked for some unpaid leave after my finals and I got it so I had 6 weeks of to visit friends and my parents. And then I spent two weeks at home, gaming, crafting, just doing stuff I like. I just moved to a nice flat with my boyfriend of three years, we don’t have money problems and I’m gonna earn like double then before. All in all a situation where people would say “No reason to be depressed.”, and they would be right.  


I started working on 1st of august again and just a couple days before I felt extremely down again. And it did not get better, I went back to work and while it’s kinda nice to see my coworkers again I’m just feeling so down and exhausted. I didn’t have much to do the first days, just checking if everything works and looking at old projects to get back on track. Organizing some stuff. This Friday I finally started to work and it all felt so overwhelming, without a real reason. Everyday when I got home I felt exhausted and could not motivate myself to do anything. Just started crying about nothing all the time. I’m also so annoyed by everything. Mostly the existence of strangers. Like people who happens to be on the train with me. The whole time I’m lowkey suicidal. Like not really but just I wouldn’t mind if a meteor would hit me or something. Yesterday all of that feelings totally went up, I had a fight with my boyfriend, nothing mayor, just a lot of feelings that boiled up. He went to the bedroom, I went to the living room, crying uncontrollably. And in that moment I just wanted to die. I just couldn’t see how I should feel better. Because there is not really a reason to feel that bad, so how should it go away. You could say, it’s lucky I’m so scared. I self harmed. Feels bad that I have done this again after such a long time and it didn’t even help. My boyfriend came and we talked and ordered food. It got a little better but now I’m sitting here and dreading having to go back to work tomorrow.   
 I only work 35 hours a week, one thing I asked for in hopes it would help with my depressions and maybe it will, right now I just need longer to work due to constructions. I know workouts are supposed to help, I haven’t been to the gym in weeks, first because I wasn’t here, then I tried but due to getting of my meds I couldn’t do a lot because they affected my body a lot. I’m so happy I’m of them now. And now I just can’t find the strength. Yesterday around noon we went to get groceries. We took our bikes, so it was like a little workout. Most of the time I were standing in the store completely disorientated.   
 I went to therapy but the hours my health care pays for are nearly used up. And I’m not sure it helped. I could try to get more hours but I’m not sure if I should. Maybe I should just call my therapist and ask for an appointment. But I’m not to sure about it.   
 Yesterday I just thought how pointless all of that is. I’ve had depressions for years. Not sure how long but at least a decade so they ain’t going nowhere. I will propably always have depressions, sometimes less sometimes more but I will always have to deal with it and I just don’t know if I want that and if it’s worth it. 

And also just looking at the state of the world right now does not make anything better. I feel we are all gonna die I a couple of years. Either because of the climate change or because of the nazis taking over. So what’s even the point in thinking about the future. 

That was a whole lot of rambling. I’m sorry for that. I’m not exactly asking for advice just needed to get it off my chest. It's not really the place to expect the thing that will make everything better.",11Aug2019,1
76,"Around 10 months ago my therapist told me that I was not ready to change and that I had too many barriers that could easily be overcome but I had too many excuses as to why I couldn't get past them. She called them ""paper barriers"". They weren't difficult, I was just unwilling.

When I was discharged she told me that I could always go back to talking therapies if I wanted to. The trouble is is that I don't know if anything's changed about my mindset towards therapy. I don't know if I'm willing to change now. I feel like I'm not but at the same time I feel as if I need therapy just so I can have someone to turn to. I just have a lot of trouble when therapist recommend exercises partly because I want everything therapy related to stay in therapy.

My last therapist wasn't bad btw. I liked her a lot and we got along with each other. Out of the 4 therapists I've seen so far she was the best one... and it still didn't work out.

77,"He has a problem. No way denying that. He now a days doesn't drink every day but if we have guests over or we have alcohol in the house you can be sure he drinks everything and then annoys everyone in the house.

He also gets a ""God complex"" when he's drunk and blaming people for not tolerating and respecting them. I'm angry and embarrassed. He is the only reason I would my future partners (if I ever get one) NEVER invite over to my house.

I don't want people to see what life I live. My mother doesn't make the situation better. She complains about him drinking but at the end of the day if he wants beer for breakfast he will get beer for breakfast because ""she can't do anything against it"".

They already fight all the time over it and my father has the deceny to not drink under the week as long as my mom is at home but when she is gone in an another country for work he even drinks under the week and the situation got once so bad that I moved out of the house for a night to a friend crying etc. And guess who got blamed for leaving the house and not wanting to come back home and ""blowing things out of proportion"" ME that's right. Having a 5 yr old sister makes it just worse.

I've known for ages that if I ever attempted suicide again it would probably be by hanging. What I'm trying to say is, should I be worried about what I think about especially the frequency? Should I tell someone? I then think if I was going to do it I wouldn't be typing all this up but maybe I'm a bit worried for myself due to the off chance.

80,"
I am so sick of people saying that beauty is ""subjective"".
Well, the choice of criteria might be subjective, but the criteria themselves are quite objective.
To illustrate my thoughts better: ""Big blue eyes with plenty of lashes are attractive"". Why people think it is beautiful is subjective, but the feature is objective. The size of eyes and lashes can be measured and compared, it is not an abstract thought. The further away you go from an ideal, the less beautiful you become (maybe only ""colour"" component is interchangeable). And that is with a lot of feautures of our body.

Yes, I can compensate it with my personality, distract myself with a hobby, but the reality is still the same - I lack the ""beauty"" asset and would only be the second sort. I can be a wonderful person (I am really not though), but I would be forever the second sort in the looks department (if not the third or tenth). No one (less than 0.01%, the exception proves the rule) would say that Emma is ugly. Almost no one would say that I am pretty. And definitely no one would consider me better than Emma.

Therefore, it seems that my body dysmorphic disorder would be with me forever :/ 

And I know that people would say that it doesn't matter etc.. but at the end of the day, you can say that about anything. Being kind is not everything because you can be exploited without inner strength, we all die regardless of anything we have etc. But I see how beautiful girls are treated, how they can sell their bath water, be admired by their fan base and boyfriends.

82,"I'm 20 years old, male. Been diagnosed with psychotic depression, anxiety and all that crap when I was younger. In case that's relevant. 

Anyway, my question is this : Why is it my body and mind seem to act so independently of each other? When I was younger I had panic attacks, but I never felt panicked. My body would hyperventilate and my muscles would contract to the point that I couldn't even move my fingers. But all the while I'd be watching and wondering why it's even happening. I'd talk, and wonder why my voice sounded so distraught when I felt fine. I got one once during MMA, doing sparring practice. I knew it was happening and felt my body go into a deep panic. But I didn't feel panic or fear. The coach sat me down and tried to calm me, but I was already perfectly calm. I've had 4 or 5 panic attacks in my life, none of which has made me feel panicked mentally.

I also feel like every emotion I feel is only there because I think I should be feeling it. If I laugh, I can stop and I don't know if I really even felt it. If I cry then I can do the same. I've been told I'm the most caring and considerate person many people have ever met. But there's not a single person I can honestly say I care about. I have a girlfriend who loves me. I got her because I feel the need for sex. But I don't enjoy sex. I feel like I should comfort her when she cries and be happy with her when she's happy. But the whole time I feel nothing at all for her. I always tell myself I just pretend not to care. Lie to myself so that I don't feel dependent. But when my father was diagnosed with a terminal illness I felt nothing but the worry of financial support when he's dead. When my ex that I was with for 3 years broke up with me, I didn't care. I told myself I should. But never did. Even my dogs dying felt meaningless. I know I'm not a psychopath or heartless. I feel emotional at times.  I just also feel like my body feels the emotion while I watch and wonder if I should too",11Aug2019,1
83,"I posted this in /r/relationships a while ago but they directed me here. All of the comments said he needs professional help. Before I start I will say that I have already reached out to his Mother, and he has his first therapy appointment next week. I'm mainly posting to help get a better idea of his issues and how I can help him in the future. I'm going to copy/pasta most of the old post I made:

*""He is quite an obscure man, and definitely a lot different than other men I have dated. Very sheltered as a kid and didn't really have a Father figure (he has said he would kill his biological Dad, and his best non-biological Dad died when he was 10). I would say he is quite neurotic because at one point he got extremely paranoid that someone was outside our door, and got his shotgun and pointed it at the door. I shouted to him (I was scared) to get back in bed. He also started drinking his hot coffee with a straw at one point because he found out he had cavities and didn't want to damage his teeth more.

He has a knack for coming up with ideas, and I have recommended that he begun writing/typing them to help keep them out of his head. One night he kind of freaked me out, because he began ranting about an idea to overthrow the government (he was thorough, and it involved violence). I pushed at him that I am against shooting people and I had enough. I told him that he needs to stop and you're scaring me. He went on about this for 30mins. He also wants to start some sort of law enforcement group that represent the people and are paid for by the people.

He has an obsession with weapons, and is a blacksmith making daggers. He told me once when we were first dating that he wanted to be a vigilante and even has an outfit put together. Whenever we have new friends over it's like show and tell/story time. He showed his friends his shotgun and I could tell they were uncomfortable with this.

He has complained about every job he has been apart of, and has made daily minutes long rants on Snapchat about his job and society in general (I told him to cut it out and he did). He wants to start his own business as he hates having a boss. He is a very disorganized person, and never has a linear process on getting ready for work.

He often gets sad about how hard it is to find new friends, and I tried to explain to him that some people are not prepared for you to go from 0 to 100 with your intense topics of conversation. He has had a lot of strange things happen to him, claiming he has had a spirit entity possess his arm. He was a problem child and he blamed it on his past lives (one as a viking, one as a solder in WW2), he claimed that his parents took him to a doctor as a kid and he has shown signs of psychopathic behavior.

A few days ago I told him to go back and grab another mug from the back of a store we were at because the one I grabbed didn't have a barcode. He didn't remember where it was even though we were there not even 5 minutes ago. I often have to repeat myself because he is off in his head.""*

----------------

Now skip to a few days ago. He went on another rant to me about his past lives, which was very disturbing and made me uncomfortable. He went on that he is concerned about this current life, and he wants to make ""memories that count"" and will be remembered in his next life.

He also said that he got his WW2 past life from a nightmare when he was 15. Saying that: ""It was so real that it had to be me."". He was first influenced by past lives from his first girlfriend. He also is close with his Ex who clearly has severe mental problems and cannot even drive because of it. I believe she really fuels his fire because she believes anything. He is now part of an Occult ""support"" group to help him through his past lives and existence in general. He sometimes blames me for not understanding this concept because I am a ""new soul"". 

I'll be honest here, I do enjoy the *concepts* of occult practices. But I only read about them for pure excitement for knowledge, and never preform rituals or spells. This has consumed his life due to (in my opinion) severe insecurity. Which has also affected him with anxiety, possible psychosis, derealization, and ego problems. It may also be fueled by his other mentally ill friends and occultism in general. At a certain time in his life he may have been very weak-willed and needed something to latch on to and make him feel important. It is just so weird to me, because when he speaks of these things his mannerisms seem like he's ""acting"" or playing a role. I feel terrible for him, and he really needs to let all this baggage go and not control his life.

I'm sorry this post is so long, but I hope I can get some clarification on what's really going on here. Please point out if I'm wrong in my suspicions because I'd like to get to the bottom of this. I'm looking forward to his therapy visit. Thank you all!",11Aug2019,1
84,"First time posting here. Sorry for the length. Backstory: I have BPD and have done a lot of shitty things in my life as a result, especially before I was diagnosed. Not an excuse, I own what I did, that's just the root cause of the behavior. 

So like the title says, I was coming clean to my partner about some shady things I did (snooping mainly) when we first got together. There were a few instances of it, and for some reason I thought only fessing up to one would ease my guilt enough and I could move on.

That didn't work and the things I didn't share ended up weighing on me to the point I couldn't eat. I shared another incident, that still didn't work, so I shared another. I even lied and said there was nothing more when he asked. Still didn't work. I realized I was being horrible and a coward and confessed to everything. My partner was completely forgiving and I felt better for a few days!

Then I started remembering other details about it. Over the following three weeks, up to now, little details would come to mind, often at random times. It was at least every other day, if not every day, and they gave me the same feeling as if I'd lied again. No amount of telling myself ""it doesn't matter"" helped even for inconsequential stuff, probably because I tried to convince myself the big stuff didn't matter when I knew it did. Keeping it in felt like ""it's a secret, it's a lie, and I'm a bad person for keeping it to myself."" The only thing that helped was telling him, but it started to wear on him. He couldn't get over it because I kept bringing it up, but I kept bringing it up because whenever something came up, I couldn't eat again. I was just tortured. A few times I could wait out the feeling, but it'd only come back stronger the next day. And then after I told him something, always thinking it had to be the last thing, something else would come up within a day or two. 

It's now gotten to the point that I'll think of crappy or shameful things I've done that are completely unrelated to the situation or to him in general, and still feel torn up about it until I ""confess."" Last night I ""confessed"" something, and my partner told me that he knew for a fact I didn't do that, based on the timing of what I was telling him. I realized he's right and felt fine the rest of the night, but now this morning I'm feeling bad about that same thing again.

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to stop it. It's like the thought just loops and gets louder in my head and I can't quiet it. I'm hopefully getting anti-anxiety meds this week, and I'm starting therapy again on Thursday, but in the meantime I'm spending most days terrified my brain is going to pop up with some new fact and ruin the day day. It's taking a toll on me and on my partner.

I know I went about this the completely wrong way in the beginning and that's probably why this is happening, but I need help. Any advice would be very welcome. I feel like I'm drowning.",11Aug2019,1

My dad is basically bipolar and my grandmother has been hospitalized for depression multiple times throughout her life. When she was raising her children she would often have emotional breaks and smash plates and shit.

These last two weeks have been basically unbearable. Suicidal thoughts constantly. Hardly able to get out of bed. No social contact. No hope for the future. I punch myself in the head daily at this point.  At one point I was in the shower and just lost control of my emotions and threw a fit. Throwing soap and bottles against the door. Soap and shampoo everywhere. 

Then last night I got home from work to find that my stepmom has moved my pepper seeds outside. A couple of other minor things happened and I just fucking lost it. I sobbed for like 30 minuets and my dad wanted to stay the night in my room. I think he was afraid I was gonna kill my self.

These issues started about 2 years ago and doctors still have no idea what the issue could be. All kind of medical tests (MRI, CT, SPECT, normal EEG, long (24h) EEG) do not show anything abnormal.
* Current medications (if any): Clonazepam (0.5-1mg per day)
* Include a photo if relevant (skin condition for example): Irrelevant

A little background: as explained above, I've been having vague mental issues for about 2 years. I've done many tests, tried all sorts of medications (antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti-epileptics,..) and seen many doctors (mainly neurologists), but so far a diagnosis could not be made. The doctors have no idea what's wrong with me and we arrived at a point where they tell me ""you'll have to learn to live with it"".

When the systoms started, I had been taking alprazolam sporadically (about 3-4 times per week) as I had these prescribed for a severe depression I had years before. I was still taking this medicine to calm down myself at times I felt it was needed.

At a certain point (around 2 years ago when the problems started), I found out alprazolam relieves my symptoms temporarily. I started taking it daily. Until this day, I have been taking 0.5mg-1mg alprazolam (xanax) on a daily basis. The doctors I've seen are not really in favor of it, but generally tell me they don't mind if this is the only thing that helps me getting through the day, as long as I don't start taking more because of tolerance. Although I have some tolerance against alprazolam, I can still feel it and it still gives me some relief. Because the psychiatrist suspected it might be a neurological problem, he switched me to clonazepam (0.5-1mg per day) a few months ago. Honestly, I feel no difference between clonazepam and alprazolam, so I've continued taking this.

I would like to stop taking benzo's. I have been thinking (parts of) my symptoms are actually withdrawal symtoms and I managed to live without benzo's on a daily basis before. I've discussed this with my psychiatrist and he told me it's up to me. I discussed a tapering method, but he said it's complete nonsense to taper off if all I'm taking is 0.5-1mg alprazolam/clonazepam per day.

So I've tried what he said and stopped cold turkey. He's what happened:

* Day 1: hard to concentrate, symptoms getting worse through the day. No relief from clonazepam this time. Falling asleep was hard, but I managed.
* Day 2: Symptoms much more severe, craving for clonazepam. I managed, but falling asleep wasn't possible anymore. I literally didn't sleep for a single minute.
* Day 3: Very tired, but still not possible to fall asleep even though I've been awake for over 24 hours. Symptoms less severe, but likely because of the tiredness. Muscle spasms starting to appear which only got worse over the day, flu-like symptoms appear. Again not being able to sleep: second night with no sleep.
* Day 4: I've been awake for 48 hours now without sleep. Very very tired, but no matter how much I try, falling asleep isn't possible. My body feels tired, but my brains feels like it's still active. I feel very ill now, needed to puke as well. I see things moving, even though I know it's not real. I think I'm starting to hallucinate, never before I experienced something like this.

At this point, I gave up. I took 1mg clonazepam and 30 minutes later I fell asleep for a long time. After I woke up, the flu-like symtoms were gone. Everything was back to normal.

Well, that's it for ""tapering isn't needed"". Honestly, I don't feel very comfortable with this psychiatrist, but I'm not able to find another one. I've done a lot of calls for an appointment outside business hours and the first available slot is Q4 2020 (not a typo). When I dropped my ""outside business hours"" demand, the first possible appointment became Q1 2020. I've actually waited this long to see a psychiatrist for a second opinion a few months ago and this second psychiatrist didn't even let me explain why I was there: he told me I belong in a mental institution (right at the start of the conversation, without ever seeing me) and shouldn't be seeking other therapists. He told me to return to the other psychiatrist and when I explained I waited half a year for this appointment to get another opinion, he literally said ""I just told you my opinion: Get yourself hospitalised inside a psychiatrist ward. I refuse to discuss this any further with you. Now get out."" The guy was a real douchebag. The reason I can get faster appointments with the my regular psychiatrist is because he limits his appointments to 20 minutes (constantly looking at the clock) and charges about 4 times the normal rate.

I feel stuck and I want to taper off benzo's, but the only psychiatrist I can see tells me tapering isn't needed and I'm overreacting when I explain the withrawal. I've seen some neurologists as well, but that was only for the medical tests, so these were 1-time appointments. The normal family doctor I see here (like a GP in the UK) tries to help me as much as she can, but also honestly tells me she doens't have any knowledge about benzo's and withdrawal and I need to see a psychiatrist for that. I asked if I could switch to diazepam (valium) and taper off slowly as this is recommended everywhere, but she doesn't really feel comfortable doing this just because I ""read it on the internet"".

Wherever I go, the Ashton manual is recommended, which basically says switching to diazepam and taper off 1mg every 1-2 weeks. However, I cannot find the reliability of this manual. I'd like to discuss this manual with my family doctor to convince her giving me a tapering plan, but before I do, I want to make sure this manual is actually a reliable source of info. Also, I'd like to know if such severe withdrawal is normal.

**TL;DR**: Taking 0.5-1mg clonazepam daily for vague mental issue complaints. Tapering off is bullshit according to my therapist because I take a low amount. Extreme withdrawal starts when I quit cold turkey. I'm unable to see another therapist for now. I wonder if the Ashton manual is really a reliable source of info and would like to know is it's normal that I go into withdrawal for quiting clonazepam when taking such a low amount.",11Aug2019,1

94,"I have a co-worker that is extremely high maintenance. They have some legitimate complaints about their position and the lack of support for it but I am realizing now that it's likely that their high stress level is just a baseline for them. At first, I did everything I possibly could to make their life easier, like I do with everyone on my team. But nothing helped. It's come to get to the point where I dread them coming into the office. 

This all came to a head last week. I have my own mental health issues (PTSD, anxiety, depression, signs of autism) and in a meeting regarding office space, they completely disregarded what I was asking for. I know I'm a lower rank than them, but I thought that they would listen to me because I've really gone above and beyond for them. All of this has resulted in me being in the worst mental state I've been in for over a decade. It's worn through my meds, and I'm just now realizing how much their behavior has mirrored emotional abuse I went through as a kid. Nothing is ever going to be good enough, it's just expected to go above and beyond and I will never get to a point where this person is satisfied or I get any sort of relief.

I'm fairly new to having a job in a place where there's so many political currents running through professional relationships. I'm also realizing that it's time to ask for accommodations for my mental health. We're supposed to meet about it this week and I'm so terrified. I keep thinking back on other things I've done and catastrophizing and worrying that either way, I'm screwed. 

So I've pissed off these powerful people and I feel like I've made a fool of myself and I just want to run away and dig a hole and disappear. I'm convinced they're going to fire me and I'll never find a job that I can stay in on a long-term basis because of my quirks. And that if I manage to keep my job here, no one will take me seriously ever again.  And it scares me that I'm so easily manipulated into prioritizing other people's crises when they obviously could not really give a shit about what I'm doing so long as they get what they want. I'm truly heartbroken that my work seems to have meant nothing to this person, and I'm also furious about it.

100,"Hello, 

This week I have experienced many panic attack and anxiety over something that is purely untrue. 
At some point I have developed the invasive “idea” that I am child predator. 

There is absolutely zero basis for this belief. I do not desire children. Have never inappropriately touched a child, have not ever thought about doing that. There is no invasive unwanted imagery or thoughts other then the overwhelming dread that I will become something I am not. 
It is debilitating. 
I am a family man. Happily married and have a child. My wife knows what’s going on and I talked to my best fiend this morning. They seem to think I have a lot of grief in my life after losing a lot of family members and I have constructed a self a wall of self sabotage to protect my self in some way. 

Even if the above self sabotage is truth, I need to seek professional help. And I did. But now I don’t know what to do. 

I did go to see a counselor on Friday and while I did talk to the professional about my personal issues , I never outright said I might be dealing with POCD. But I did say There was something I couldn’t share. Because I didn’t trust her and she didn’t know me.  At some point during the session she asked if this “thing” was “illegal” and I answered yes. 

I am terrified of telling my counselor the truth and then having cps or the police  called for something I have not done or will ever do. 

Any help or advice in this would be appreciated. I love my family. And I am petrified with fear that this is happening to me.

However he's also pretty horrible to be around and as much as I know hes not really in control I found myself dreading him waking up. What mood is he gonna be in? Am I going to be accused of something today? Is there going to be an incident? All things I sit and worry about.

105,"18 years ago i vas born in Bursa/Turkey. Maybe because im still too young but i remember most of my life since i was 3-4 years old. Most of my toddlerhood involved getting yelled at by people for not doing anything minor by the codes of etiquette.
 You don't want to sleep at the kindergarten? You get yelled at for being an incompetent brat because you can't go to sleep at 13.00 when tucked in. You can't even wipe your a** properly in a hygenic manner at age fecking 5. You just won a good long insulting session. Keep in mind this applies to literally everyone. Parents, teachers and all the people that can exist in a toddlers life. 
   Oh but the fun just starts. Imagine being left with a super religious (i hate zealots now probably because of her.) (I don't care if you are a mormon or wahhabi you are equally bad in my eyes. I can't stand religious extremism.) (parents didn't like her but she was willing to work for less) babysitter who is about to die for aprox 4-6 hours because parents constantly work or was just didn't want to contact me because they don't like ""chores"". Yes i was just a thing that required maintinance. Even then they paid someone else to do it. 
   When i started elementary school things took a 180 degree turn and now i was a gold bar that needed to be worked on so i can one day be presented as jewelery. 
   They were constantly inwolved in my education life but nothing else. He wants to go to a playdate. Hell no i didn't pay some crazy weirdo to raise my children so that they socilize. He must work MORE MORE MORE so he may be somewhat competent.
   I was never loved as who i was or simply as a child. NO if i wanted to be loved i had to earn it by showing exemplary exam marks or any kind of nation wide talent showcase. I can't count the times i was told to go kill myself simply i wast the first in at least the class. Trough this abusive behaviour, neglect, social exile from other students i somehow got into a wery prestigious high school. 
   It was this time that the abuse went out of control. Everything i did/say/behaved was harshly critisized. Yet i persisted in my ways of earning respect. I studied 12-14 hours everyday for the senior year. Previously it was 10 or more. I totally was in belief that once i start uni i would earn the respect that i deserved and needed. Three months before the uni exam i was forced to enter the military uni exam. When the results came my world was utterly shattered. It was 34k out of 400k. I mean for a regular student it was ok but for me it was a massive disappointment (i expected 5k at most). 
    Then just one month  before the exam i was in my room. At 02.00 my parents burst into my room yelling and cursing at me for being an incompetent son. I just silently watched. And then with the added fury of my silence my dad yells at the top of his lungs YOU ARE NOT THE SON I DESERVE. It was an emotional rollercoaster. It was the moment i derailed. It was the moment i realised i didn't have a childhood. For the last 12 years i worked day and night to deserve love and atention. I didn't have anyone to love me no friends no family no nothing. The only thing i had was my work. 
   A white canvas with a single straigt line in the middle is the accurate representation of my life. The only thing i knew and believed in was working. The only things that kept me going was the hope that maybe someday someone would love me and my academic success unconditionally. 
    And yet my world was going to be broken once again. The day that the results were announced left a deep scar in everything i believed in. I was at 93k out of 2.5million. It wasn't bad it just was a mark of the end of my academic success. For the last 4 years i lost my friends,prestige,personality,self and/or any kind of respect,not to mention the countless hours. And now at last i lost the thing that kept me going. With that i believed in my self to some degree. But now its gone.

The doctor came back and flat out said 'So it looks like you have severe depression with anxiety, with a huge risk of PTSD.' Kind of a shock considering I don't really feel depressed and notice myself exhibiting PTSD-like behavior. I was given a referral to a counselor that would visit the doctor's office every so often and made an appointment to see the doctor after a month. I did not visit the doctor because she took that day off. I did not reschedule. 

I told my whole family. My grandparents and mother said they'd support me any way they could. My father says the doctor is lying and gave me a wrong diagnosis. I'm not even sure if it was a diagnosis because I wasn't prescribed anything. The doctor simply suggested I talk to the in-house counselor.

109,"BACKGROUND DETAILS:

I’ve been at an amazing, exponentially growing, tech company for about 7-8 months. After a few months of “training” we move on to our sales goals in the business to business division. We have ‘productivity metrics’ that prove you’re putting in the efforts to meet your goal. - I have worked in sales and burned out several times from depression brought on by hating the sales process but, loving connecting with strangers. I’m #blessed ;) to be able to build rapport and gain real trust from my prospects/clients quickly. - when I signed on for the position it was account management and I thought this was a great way to utilize my talents without needing to sell. i have a few friends who are in account management, and do not do what i do. I’m basically turning and burning qualifying leads/spenders.

The month of June I missed 10 days, sporadically. A friend in my department died and my close connection with death thru (coming close but never) attempting to fatally harm myself. - I came back in July and led my team in sales because I feared I’d lose ANOTHER job and this place is great. - mental health isn’t well talked about even though they pose themselves as the most caring multi-billion dollar organization. My job has been threatened directly several times. 

SITUATION:

I scheduled a meeting with my department vice manager; my boss’s boss. She has weird feels towards me and I just revealed to my direct manager that I do have bipolar disorder. I came in last Thursday and just cried at my desk, I asked for a wellness day at 7:20 and he turned me down at 7:40. So I was then running behind which was icing on the cake. My numbers for the month are hideously low and I fear I’ll have a bad month and prove my incapabilities. —

QUESTION:

How should I steer my convo for best results. I seek empathy and for her to know i want to help myself and I want to do well for this company. I am smart and capable but, just not for this position. - they refuse the idea of me working from home some days, even tho that would solve the problem immediately imo. 

She’s younger early 30s, smart, success oriented and forms socially circles. Which I used to be a part of until my performance in Q2 landed me at 70% of my goal and more depressive traits revealed; for example, isolation, bailing on team outings, quiet, jumbling words, being awkward lol she obviously is aware of my friends death as he was her subordinate, that’s why I received leniency for those absences but, I’m viewed poorly now and certainly not first draft for upward or lateral movement.

There are so many details missing so I guess just ask, I fear it’ll be too long for interest already..

We're from Ontario, Canada.

The family is in a downward spiral. Family consists of mom, younger brother, older brother, sister + me. My sister and I have moved out and are the only ones to complete high school. The family has no structure, any rules are easily walked over without a consequence -  don't want to go to school? That's bad! I'm so disappointed! But feel free to continue your gaming at your leisure.

Nobody is healthy or cares about their physical/mental health. Mom stocks the fridge/freezer with frozen food, 10+ candy bar brands, a multitude of potato chips, all the pop, cookies, ice cream, everything unhealthy you could imagine, she has it. The house is in a state of disrepair and is disgustingly dirty - things only get cleaned in common areas and even then they aren't cleaned well, just enough to get by.

Mom has always been over sensitive, mentioning an issue that's in any way critical of her will result in crying in seconds and you're the bad guy for saying something -- or you're too hard on her -- or she tries her best and has always done her best as a mom. She smokes, is overweight and struggles to follow a diet / exercise, but has tried various times. 

Older brother (mid-twenties) is obese, has paranoid schizophrenia, is totally unhinged and could do something dangerous any day. Won't check himself into a psych ward because he believes he doesn't have an illness and that the government is terrorizing him (See [electronic harassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_harassment)). He has never emotionally matured and uses emotional blackmail to get what he wants out of our weak-willed mother. Impossible for him to follow a medication regimen as he has very little short term memory and my mother is constantly forgetting to remind him.

Younger brother is extremely obese (400+ lbs), gaming 16+ hours a day and avoids sunlight at all costs. He's been diagnosed with Asperger's and avoids all social interactions unless relentlessly pushed. Recently failed all of his grade 12 classes, went to exams and didn't fill out a single question. Teachers say he was on his phone all class, yet my mother did nothing.

My other family has said they'd like to stay out of it. Don't know what to do, any tips / opinions would be much appreciated. Thanks!",11Aug2019,1
113,"Honestly, this is just a rant about my own self-absorbed misery. If anyone has any advise or support, I could use it.

Where to start? First, I am a full time working mom, an army veteran, as well as a student. I am in a difficult marriage with a husband with severe depression. Because of his depression, I do 99% of the housework, child care, and pet care and he doesn't work, so I am also the breadwinner. He does go to school, and I don't want to take away from that but he is always home by noon and only has school 4 days a week and has so much more time than I do in his day. I understand I need to pick up his slack because of the depression and be supportive, but it is so frustrating because he refuses to get any sort of help for his depression. If he was, I would have more patience. 

I feel like I have absolutely no support. I am not close to my family and they live on the other side of the country. I had a hard childhood, so keep them at a distance. I was kind of close to his family, but there have been some recent family problems that is making me reconsider how good they are for me and my child to be around. I don't have any real friends because I don't have time to make any. I am always busy with work, school, my daughter, or housework. If I ever do make any sort of plans, my husband makes them impossible because he throws a fit. 

Basically, I am burnt out and breaking down. I feel like I have so much pressure and no way to really deal with it. My husband isn't a good support because he has his own issues. I would love to go to therapy, but I don't know when I would even have time. I'm just exhausted, stressed, and most of all, unbelievably lonely.

114,"Hello everyone I have a problem and don’t know where to turn. I’m 21 years old and for the last couple years I haven’t felt happy or sad or anything. I have a good job with regular raises. I travel around the world and I have plenty of friends that want to hang out. But even when a good buddy of mine died from a fentanyl overdose last week I didn’t feel anything. I don’t feel anything anymore and I don’t know what to do. I’m at a breaking point right now and I don’t how much longer I can keep going like this. I don’t know what to do.

116,"Okay, this is hard for me to type because I don't like to admit to myself that this is a problem, but in having a ""flare up"" of sorts and it's horrible. 

I have this constant fear of being watched....? Usually by photographs. I can't hang family photos on the walls, I can't hang band posters with faces on them,  even book covers and game cases....if it's got eyes/faces on, it freaks me out. I have to cover my phone cameras, CCTV terrifies me and sometimes the paranoia is so bad I have to cover the windows and turn the lights off. It's the only way I feel safe.

I know it's not normal, but where would I start in getting help for this? I'm in the UK and our mental health care is a bit lacking but I know I can't continue like this. I'm diagnosed with depression and anxiety but my family history is laced with bipolar &amp; schizoid disorders and I'm frightened that this might spiral out of my control some day. I've had dissociative episodes that catch me by surprise (luckily very rarely) and I'm worried that if that ever coincides with a flare up of paranoia, I'll be in a bad state. 


Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",11Aug2019,8
117,"I've been meaning to post this for a while now because a bit of insight or reassurance would really help me out but I couldn't muster the energy to write this down till today.

I'm 24 and last year, around October or November (Can't keep track of time too well) I was admitted into a private mental institution because my family wasn't sure I was dealing with my mother's death too well. Before her passing I already knew that something was wrong with me but since she was diagnosed with depression and some psychosis (they later said it was schizophrenia) I didn't want my mental problems to become too much of a burden. Ever since I was 11 or 12, I struggled with depression and severe anxiety, the latter coming from fears that I had growing up about silly stuff like people following me home or stalking me even if there was no evidence to back it up. It wasn't until I was locked up that I finally got diagnosed with shizoaffective disorder and borderline personality disorder which wasn't that much of a shocker because I learned how to cope with psychosis eventually and usually had people around me to help me out when I wasn't making much sense. Sometimes i would be in danger cause my thoughts would get really mixed up and I had a tendency to hurt myself.

I knew how to sort of deal with all of that stuff and I was doing really well after getting out because I was taking medications and going to therapy. (Klonopin, abilify and escitalopram) but lately something really weird is happening to me and I feel really lost and confused, also I had to stop taking my medication and going to therapy because I can't afford it and I lost all of my friends and people around me that would help me out in that way.

Everything that has happened this year has become sort of a mush in my brain and I can't tell what has happened or what hasn't, I can't point a date to any event and sometimes what happened in a month felt like it happened in a week. Im losing chunks of time; I would be at work one second and then I would find myself at home without knowing how I got there. It's really concerning and I have no idea what it actually is. As of right now I remember some of the things that went on but I don't really feel like they happened to me, I keep getting flashbacks that won't let me sleep. I'm dealing with so much regarding depression and anxiety but at least I know what those two are like. This is very new and very unsettling. Have any of you dealt with this? is it normal for someone who has been diagnosed with those things to experience this? I just need some insight.",11Aug2019,2

It hurts knowing someone that I’m so close to just thinks I’m a lyre, he also suffers from mood disorders but I also suffer from brain disorders aswell and I feel like he can’t grasp it properly because he’s not going through it and doesn’t experience it, what can I do to help people understand what’s going on in my head because I can’t find the words and I can’t open up like I want to because of the fear of it all.",11Aug2019,6

120,"I've spoken aloud to myself ever since I was 8 (17 now). I do this in whispers, conversing with an imaginary character who I decided to name after my bestfriend at the time, let's call him ""Tom"". I'm hardly in contact with the real Tom anymore, and ""Tom"" never shared any similarities with the real guy, so there is no connection between them.

Disclaimer: ""he"" - referencing my imaginary friend. ""him"" doing something is me pretending to be him, and I'm fully aware of this as I do it.

To talk to Tom, I whisper to him in my normal voice. ""He"" then responds back with a slightly deeper whisper. I tell Tom what I'm going to do for the rest of my day. I tell jokes to him, ""he"" laughs back. I tell him my opinion about almost any given situation, ""he"" responds back with his opinion. I don't know how I come up with his opinions, it's just second nature to me, I've never given it much thought. I suppose I'd say that he mostly agrees with me, offers insight that I would have otherwise expanded on if asked to by a real person. When he disagrees, he normally responds very reasonably. He might tell I'm stupid as a joke, but we've never been in an argument and he's never been mad with me. Very occasionally, he'll try to calm me down.

I haven't been diagnosed with any mental illnesses. I've always strongly disliked my appearance, have bad social anxiety and depression. However, I have people to talk to. Specifically one person who I talk to almost all day, and 3 - 4 that I'll get into conversation with every few days.

Thank you. sorry for the paragraph haha

Edit: I should mention a few more things:

\- I won't always choose to talk out loud to him. If I'm too tired, have a sore throat (for example) then I'll talk to him in my head. Again, imagining his responses.

\- I very easily switch off from talking out loud to him around other people, although I'm pretty sure my parents have caught me once or twice (when it's 3am I don't expect anyone downstairs hehe). Never been called out on it though.",11Aug2019,4

My younger sister has always been a shy person outdoors but fun and calm at home. She loved videogames and basically sports 'cause she copied her bigger 4 brothers.

She's 14 now but since july she started changing to an extremely angry person....(fyi we are muslim)

she never wore a hijab and no one forced her but she suddenly started wearing one and trying to hide her face in public more and more this july..

Now shes always scared and angry and saying shes seeing a certain monster or something thats dissing her or stalking her and making her angry but then she is suddenly back to her normal self aftee a few hours, she's happy and playful. We tried everything we can but medical help cause we live in a country where mental heatlh is seen as non-existent and your problems can be fixed by a spiritual healer(a sheikh/imaam).

Basically;

\- she became very angry person and quiet

\- she says something is stalking her, taunting her and dissing her. something imaginary

\- she has random mood swings that i cant understand why.

So, I’ve had SOOCD/HOCD(sexual orientation OCD/homosexual OCD) for a few years and I was worried I could turn myself gay.

I’ve also had a hypnosis fetish in the past and I’ve seen some mock hypno porn that doesn’t actually hypnotize. But today I looked at a “subliminal” gif that showed pics of hot girls and flashes of light as well as a spiral and flashing messages that were there for like a second each saying stuff like “brainwashed”, “Slave”, “happy”, aroused, etc and while looking at it I masturbated and orgasmed. I felt strangely happy afterward and I feel more homosexual and I’m just super super scared. I’m scared it actually did something to me :(. I want it gone :( :( :(. 

Is it possible that it actually worked? My sexuality can’t change right?

Just can someone please offer advice or support because I’m scared but oddly happy at the same time. Maybe it’s because I noticed the “subliminals”. Idk if they’re even real though. 

Can someone please please PLEASE help?

Could this just be my anxiety or OCD?",11Aug2019,2
125,"15 minutes with a man in a tie and a shiny plaque on his desk and I've been diagnosed with agoraphobia and PTSD. I agree with the agoraphobia, absolutely. I'm 25 [23 when I was diagnosed and prescribed meds I no longer take] and people scare the absolute shit out of me. I have this intense fear of leaving my house. My heart accelerates, my eyes dart all over the place looking for anyone who might be near me, my mind races with all the things that people are[n't] thinking about me.

I have people telling me I need meds. I have people telling me I DON'T  need meds.
People saying I just need a hobby.
I just need to go on walks.
I just need this.
I just need that.

TRUST ME I would love to go outside and not have a damn care in the world. I would love to have friends. I would love to be able to do the things I want in life.

I have zero passion for my art. None for my cooking, my job, my family. I have zero motivation to do anything but sit and zone out to mindless things like netflix for 20 hours at a time. I want to love things again. I want to be excited about anything at all.

I'm literally scared to be alone in public for more than 5 minutes. I start fidgeting, looking for all the exits, tuning in to all the laughing because  OF COURSE they're all laughing at me. But I know that's not true. No one even notices me in reality, my mind just fucks with me and makes me think they're all laughing at me. 

Commitments scare me.
I've never had a friendship for longer than a year.
I ruin them all. No, that's not a pity me, oh woah is me thing. Literally I sabotage my own relationships. I don't care after a certain point. I do things to them to hurt them and make them hate me. Then I block them and isolate myself. I shut my phone off for 2 months at a time and deactivate social media.

I need to see someone again, but my therapist was so uncomfortable. He would just listen and ask the vaguest of questions. You can't do that to someone who has severe social anxieties. You need to keep talking and help edge the conversations along. Not just say ""tell me about yourself"" and then allow 5 minutes to pass with zero talking because my brain has shut down and my anxiety spiked.

Idk what that is, a defensive mechanism? My mind just goes blank and I can't for the life of me think of a single thing to say.

My psychiatrist just threw pills at me. One of the meds I was on nearly made me kill myself. I took tweezers to my skin till my whole body was torn apart because ""the bumps are disgusting"". 

Another medication made me high and paranoid.   I was tripping out at work. I was so uncomfortable I wanted to scream. I must have looked like a tweaker. 

I'm tired of this. I'm tired of complaining and just existing till the next day. I want to live. I want to be apart of conversations,  not just stand there staring. I'm so tired of feeling more and more suicidal. I KNOW I don't really want to die. I'm just so low in depression right now that I feel like I can't do anything when in reality I can do everything.",11Aug2019,2

I feel empathy very heavily but i cant relate to people with feelings that others describe as sadness in anyway. I have been like this for aa long as I remember but what made me tginj something is wrong was that a couple of months ago my parents divorced (before got judge read everything). My sister cried like I don't know what my mom and dad was tearing up but what I was thinking about was when I could get back to watching my show. Later my rabbit needed to get put down, he lived for 7 years with some problems with his legs (maybe 2 weeks ago). My sister is destroyed but I don't feel much about it. It's all just foreign to me I guess. Another thing I have been thinking about is that when I'm bored or just not doing anything I tend to think of suicide. I don't know why I just find life meaningless and tasks in the day keeps me distracted. I think, I don't know though. I don't feel comfortable taking about me with people I know. I also don't want to get looked at as an attention seeker. My childhood (even though I'm only 13) has been perfect. I live in a nice house, we are well of, I got 2 amazing parents that go beyond and do everything I ask them for.  I got everything I could ask for. Still I regularly think that life ultimately doesn't matter and I could just end it. But I just don't have the energy to do it.

For example I refuse to go outside whenever I see a neighbour, who are all really nice just because i dont know how to react. Do I say hi or just blankly ignore them. If I get into any remote conversation with anyone I star fidgeting and getting really nervous. 

At school i am rejected by everyone apart from about 5 friends. They all would rather i wasnt there. Most dont tell me to my face, but i can tell just by the way they act. They never pick me for sport, complain if I stand anywhere near them and groan whenever I enter the room. It's horrible. 

I'm an introvert and dont like people. But I still hate it when they would rather I dont exist.

133,"By being a piece of human trash.

I don't think I myself have some major problem, but I do a lot of dumb stuff out of boredom, I guess. Stuff like running away, returning home still drunk, getting kicked out by our mother (and out of school, but that's a whole different story), I whored myslef out for food, cigarettes and drinks and have a terrible reputation amongst people I know and apparently even people I don't know. For some reason she knows about it. My guess is that our mother told her, which I think is irresponsible to bring a kid into it. But who am I to talk about responsibility.

I also do weird or innapropriate stuff at home, like walking around with scars on my arm and legs, I snapped and raged at her and even her friend who is now afraid of me. As far as the weird stuff goes, I told my sister countless times to hide her candy or else I'll eat it when I feel bad.

I'm worried, because she's starting to act out. She cut her arm badly when she hit and broke something, she snaps at our mother (even told her she's going to kill herself) and one time when I was out drinking she cried and peed herself. At 10. At least my mother told me so. There's still a chance she lied.

And there's also the fact that another our sister bullied her. I am the older sister who is supposed to be there for her. Instead I'm bitter and passive. I guess it's because it's hard to care about anything else when I couldn't care less about myslelf.",11Aug2019,0
134,"Hello all, this is my first ever post on reddit so be gentle with me if I get the formatting wrong or something. I have been lurking on here for a while though so hopefully not. 

Bit of context first. I will try to be brief, and will probably fail. 

Growing up, I spent half my time with my mum, and half at my dad's, from the age of 7 when they divorced. My mum is an absolute angel, so no issue there, but my dads house was very unpleasant. Both he and his new wife are emotionally and verbally abusive, manipulative and cruel, and all round arseholes. Also, they are both bipolar,  just to spice things up a bit (meeting in a psychiatric facility). Having met other bipolar people though, this was not the issue, the main problem was their awful characters. But it didn't help. Won't go into examples as quite a few, but looking back I was treated pretty damn badly whilst there. 

Anyway, I basically kept that a complete secret from absolutely everyone and dealt with it until I went to uni at 18. The need to get away was only amplified after my now step-mum was sectioned after nearly killing the younger of my two new half-sisters the summer before I left (through negligence not violence, she allowed her to play with her medication, only reason she is alive now is because she preferred the colour blue so ate the blue ones, if she ate the white ones she'd be dead apparently. Was a nervous wait finding out). I finally thought I'd got out. 

I went to uni, and finally got a good look at myself. Turned out I was an absolute mess, and almost immediately got hit by what I now realise was the beginnings of depression. Went back for christmas and during those few weeks my dog died, my grandad had a stroke and god mother was diagnosed with cancer. Didn't help matters. When I went back to uni, things went downhill super quick. I really lost the plot. Anxiety came in hard alongside the depression, which was spiralling out of control. Again, no one knew anything. I was apparently really good at hiding stuff, which makes sense given that's what I'd been doing my whole life. 

I started attempting to self-medicate with illegal drugs, who'd have thought that could go wrong. Initially it did help to be fair, they meant I could actually be around people without shaking from fear. Unfortunately,  I then had a psychotic period of a few months as a result of overdoing them substantially, and that absolutely screwed my brain. The combination of severe depression, an anxiety disorder, and psychosis, was a really unpleasant one. I was ripping down everything on my wall in the uni room convinced there were hidden cameras with people filming me in order to torment me further, genuinely terrified for my life, thought my friends were plotting to kill and torture me, kept seeing people lunging at me with knives when they didn't exist, and spent most of my time curled up in the foetal position at the end of my bed in the corner crying. Also, in the rare moments of lucidity, I would still be terrified, just from the fact I thought I was schizophrenic. My uncle is, one of my first memories is visiting him in the joint highest criminal psychiatric ward in England after he nearly killed his best friend with a knife because the voices in his head told him so. I thought that would be me. Turns out it was drug-induced and temporary, but I was convinced it was going to be permanent at the time.

At this point I was very much suicidal. Luckily, end of term came and when I got home my mum immediately realised something wasn't right. I'd lost about 4 stone in that term (around 25kg), was eating a sandwich every few days basically and was genuinely starving myself, but more than that I was an absolute shell of a human. Zero personality left, just a collection of overwhelming fear and terror. That was over 6 years ago now. 

Basically it took me 5 years to get back into society. For about 4 years of those, I didn't leave the house except to see my doctors. My dad continued to make things worse, my therapist ended up having to be in contact with him instead of me, and she described him as the hardest family member of a patient she'd ever had to deal with. After 3 years though he went to live in South Africa, and I actually started to recover. Before this I was one of the most extroverted and sociable people you could hope to find. Not seeing my friends for that long was hard. Wouldn't want anyone to be that lonely. I remember one night there was a party very near my house that I knew a few of my mates were at, and I sat at the window for 5 hours listening for their voices. I heard what I thought was them about 3 times, and it made my month. 

Thankfully, I am now off anti-depressants!! I completed my first year of university (getting a 2.1 in philosophy) and in the summer holidays was given the go-ahead to stop taking them. Was an unbelievable feeling. 

However, now the elation has gone, I've realised there's still more to do. I'm healthy, but I'm still being held back from becoming the person I could be by insecurities and the like. Basically, I can't get myself to start anything I want to do. I put way too much pressure on myself, to the extent that I get so nervous that I don't do anything. I really didn't do too much work at uni, despite being fascinated by it, and barely turned up to lectures although that was largely anxiety related. I love reading, but can never do it. Last time I did I was actually shaking. I want to continue writing a novel I started, and yet I tell myself it's awful and I can't bring myself to carry on writing. I used to be very into rugby at school and want to get back into it, and yet have managed to do some exercise precisely one time in the last couple months. The only thing I feel safe doing is playing video games for hours on end. 

I think it largely has to do with worrying about not being good enough. If I don't try, I can't fail, and I have a massive fear of failure and not being good enough, instilled in me from a young age by being told exactly that quite frequently. It's becoming so frustrating, I'm healthy and yet can't actually do any of the things I want to, and therefore can't be the person I want to be. It's really holding me back. No real idea how to counteract this. 

If you got to the end of that, thanks. Appreciate you taking the time to read. Any advice anyone would have on dealing with the kinds of insecurities that might be preventing me from doing anything productive would be wonderful. Have a good day everyone!",11Aug2019,1

Hello I'm new to Reddit I don't know if this is the right place to post this or if it's the proper title so please forgive any mistakes also, I have had this bottled up inside me for a long time and need to get it out

First, some back story my parents divorced when I was 11 and my brother was 27 my mom got custody of me and my two younger siblings and a restraining order against my dad he was a drunk and not a nice person but if you met my grandpa you would understand why. We moved away and I met my then best friend in sixth grade I'm older by about a year she was born in May of 97 and I was born in November of 96.

Side note I have PTSD and major depression

When I was 18 I finally got the chance to see my big brother again he lived with my dad and still dose my dad stopped drinking was doing his best to have a good relationship with me. everything was awsomewith my brother we went to paint ball games, played video games, ate out and all kinds of fun stuff untill I messed up I invited my best friend to a paint ball game with me and my brother and they hit it off and started seeing eachother I told them I wasn't comfortable with their relationship and we needed to talk it out to find where everyone was She was a known cheater and liar and was in love with someone else and my brother is a moron immediately after they started dating she started cheating with the guy she is in love with and stop hanging out and talking to me about three months later my relationship with my dad and brother started going downhill she moved in with them and started turning them against me saying all kinds of shit for the first year of their relationship she cheated with the guy she really loved I got the prof and told my brother he tells her he wants to break up she comes to me crying telling me she ""needs me"" when I tell her to F off she gets nasty yells at me then leaves a week later she tells my brother I'm out to get them and she is pregnant with his kid after about a mounth she ""miscarried"" ( just so you know she dose this all the time tells the guy she is pregnant to stop them from braking up with her then says she lost the baby). in march of the next year he wants to break up again (she is still cheating ) and a little bit later she says she is pregnant this time it was real. She had a boy and he looks nothing like my brother but what pisses me off the most is she talks about how she doesn't and never wanted the baby and she hates that it's ""my brothers"" with a small group of friends that keep it to themselves but made sure I could hear it when I was around (family reunions) i stopped going to family events because her and her friends would go out of there way to my it a bad day for me things like makeing sure I didn't get any food putting gum and sap in my hair she went as far as to tell everyone about my sexual history and the things I have to live with now I lost a lot of relationships after that I have multipule cusons and aunt/uncles that view me as unclean now ( most of my fmaily is mormon and some are catholic)  I haven't seen or talked to my dad in two years because of her my brother trys but I just can't do it the amount of toxicity that follows him around is too much for me to handle he brings the baby over once every blue moon so my mom can see him but I have to stay in my room with the door locked or go to a friends  becuse she is here I love my brother and dad with all my heart but she has made a healthy relationship with them impossible I feel alone and unwanted.

137,"This weekend I had therapy, got a haircut, went grocery shopping, went to a dog festival, went with my friends to an old carnival, made myself a delicious breakfast, went on a hike, and made myself a delicious lunch. Now, I just got out of the shower, brushed my teeth, and did a whole skin care routine. 

This might sound normal to some people. An average weekend of errands and social things. But I'm very mindful of all of it. Because not too long ago, my weekends were spent getting high or drunk and a lot of these simple things felt out of reach. Now I'm taking care of myself and I feel so much lighter. It's pretty neat.",11Aug2019,331

141,"I'm 14 and have diagnosed social anxiety. I'm also severely sensitive and get angry easily . (for ex: if someone says ""gotta go bye!!"" over text, I'll automatically assume they're just making an excuse to stop texting me because they hate me.) I cry a lot, about 3 times a day. Maybe it's just hormones but no one else my age (from what I can tell) has anxiety so bad as mine. I dont think I'm depressed, maybe a little but anyway, I cry a LOott. If I'm arguing with someone I'll get frustrated and start crying. If a math problem has me stumped for over a minute, I'll cry. If i'm embarrassed I'll cry which makes the situation worse. and so on. once at my piano lesson my face turned really red and i began to shake violently because I messed up a bit on my piece and lost my place, even though it was just me and my teacher in the room!! i felt a lump in my throat from embarrasment and i knew she was judging me so hard. just a few minutes ago i accidentally broke the zipper on my skirt and had a full blown uncontrollable breakdown even though it was easily fixable. help. is this normal?????",11Aug2019,9
142,"Buckle up this is a long rant... 

Let's start with the fact I am frustrated. I feel like I'm not getting heard when I say things to people and I know sometimes I am my own saboteur because I'm afraid to hurt those that love me but something is wrong with my brain.  I've never slept well.  Since I was little I was known to stay up till 7am and sleep till 11am and sometimes miss days of sleep.  I have a very long history of all the trauma and I come from a very broken family.  Most people I grew up with are dead and I have used different drugs. I'm dx PTSD, OCD, DID and EDNOS. With that comes the smacked on anxiety and depression but here's the thing, I'm not depressed at least not more than the usual person who's sad sometimes. No. I'm overwhelmed. My random bouts of crying come from panic not saddness. I feel constantly on the brink of a nervous breakdown and the last four months have seen this be the worst. I need constant stimulation. I can't be in silence or I start to feel physically ill. I'm easy to anger to these points of unfathomable rage over stupid things. I have an easy job and I'm enraged that it's too easy.  Someone talks to me, I can't see someone I want to see, my phone isn't working the way I want it, the store is out of something I wanted,  the train is late, I got enraged over needing to pee FFS. This has never been who I am.  I'm not an angry person. I self-harm.  I have on and off since 10. I need to stress I'm not on drugs and haven't used in a long time. But I self-harm. I think about suicide often but I also think about cutting open my arm and pulling things out of it. When I'm angry I think about stabbing the irritant but never will I ever do that. This is also new.  I've never been homicidal before. I don't think I'm seeing things. My eyesight is bad so little things I see that aren't there like something moving outside my direct line or if I see colors or spots or something moving across my vision I just chalk it up to eye injuries. I know something is wrong with me. This isn't me. Not at all. No one will listen. My excitement has been more outbursts and agitation undirected and flurry of project starting.  My suicidal moments are getting darker and darker. Harder to resist and harder to get help for.  Whatever is happening to me has me terrified of myself. I'm only 27. I can't live like this for the rest of my life. 

Sorry this is long typed out in a rush on a long walk.. I just don't know where to go for help anymore. The moment I'm in the hospital I just quickly trick them into thinking I'm fine and letting me out. I can't keep doing this. I need answers.  I need help.",11Aug2019,3
143,"I’m the youngest of 7. (24F). I was born and raised into the Mormon religion. I left years ago, after knowing for my whole life I would leave, and that none of the church made any sense to me. I also am a lesbian, so I couldn’t be Mormon and lesbian. 

Well since coming out of the closet last year, my family has been having a really hard time with me. I guess they thought there was still a chance in me coming back into the religion someday? But I’ve had my records removed and everything. 

My depression and anxiety has always been a big factor in my life. Big since leaving the church and coming out it has gotten much better. Though this year has been extremely rough. Had an abusive relationship for too long, cause that’s all I knew. That’s all I saw growing up. (Though I’m now in a really great and healthy relationship). I was jobless up until two weeks ago. Which didn’t help with my mental health. 

Barely any of my family have been supportive of me. My two brothers have been there for me. With one of them having been out of the church too. But neither of them have really really been there. Out of my 4 sisters I’ve only ever had a decent relationship with one of them. She’s 2 years older than me. She had two precious baby girls. They’re the loves of my life (besides my cats). They’re the only children I’ve ever loved. And my sister knows that I looove to see the pictures and videos of the girls. Well I just realized I haven’t seen any FB or insta updates. Which is strange cause she posts a LOT. Especially because she sells for rodan and fields which is an o line business. And makes posts for it daily. I don’t support her business as I can’t afford it. (And I see it as a pyramid scheme, sorry to anyone who sells it) Which she has always been ok with obviously. When I lived back in that state I would go to her parties she held for them too. But anyway, I haven’t seen anything from her, so I went to look at her FB page. I couldn’t even find it. I went to her insta, and I couldn’t see it. Said it was a private page. I was stunned! So I texted my cousin to see if she could see anything. And she said she could see her stories. Meaning my sister removed me from all social media. 

Yes I blocked my other sisters, cause they have been outright homophobic. To my face. One of my sisters told me bat every bad thing that happened to me this year has been my fault. (None is it has been). I’ve just had a stream of bad luck. None of my family (brothers excluded) would help me financially this year. I had to get a gofundme to try and make rent last month. If it weren’t for my new job I wouldn’t make rent this month. Though it’s gonna be really late.  

I’m just not understanding why my sister just older than me would remove me and block me? She’s always been supportive of me making my own life’s choices. I told her first and months before I came out that I was gay. And she told me she would still be there for me. When my dad told me her would even attend my future wedding, she said she’d walk me down the isle. But now that I have a partner who NB, she won’t speak to me. I messaged her last Monday, she’s seen it and hasn’t responded. I called her on about Wednesday to talk and she was super distant with me. 

I just don’t know what to do? Do I confront her?",11Aug2019,2
144,"I moved to Norway a year ago, after living for more than a decade in Dubai. It didn't feel like a choice, considering that it was either that or a move back home to Indonesia - I'd have to start over both ways, with language I'm not 100% comfortable with, but looking at how the world works we thought it was good to first go West, then decide where life takes us next. I'm 18 now; with most around my age that's just about the time where you let loose and start living your life like how you want it to be. However I feel like that is not the liberty that I have at the moment, although all it takes is a different perspective. 

I came to Norway hoping that the West would bring opportunities far better than I would expect in Dubai. 

When I attended my first class of what is currently the last two years of high school, I brought with me positive energy that a lot of people took notice to. However there was a few people in class that had issues with themselves, and created issues with others. There was one prominent guy though, who saw the 'potential' in me when nobody wanted to approach me (people were very shy), and we both sort of 'decided' that we would be friends, as we both saw in each other massive amounts of experience and wisdom unrivalled by anyone in class. 

I would describe my actions during my last year of school in Dubai as a little Machiavellian. I am no psychopath. But after meeting R (prominent guy), it became apparent to me that he was just the same as I was - but he was more of an asshole than I could ever be. Our thought processes were the same,  our list of decisions that we could make were the same, and first few months of being friends - and I think one of the mistakes was that we trusted each other (or he trusted me) too quick - was perfectly fine. I did what I wanted with the knowledge I had, became one of the presidents of the student body and blabla, but the trouble really started when I started to compare myself constantly to R. The fact that we were so similar, yet he was apparently more successful than I am created this envy within me. I wanted to be him real bad. This guy was hated by our whole class though - he experimented (and 'had fun') mentally with a lot of the people in class, and it contributed to an environment last year that sucked pure ASS. 

It was one of the big reasons why I started to compare myself. Although my wisdom and experiences were similar to his, he was just more willing and confident to speak up than I was. He had a clearer mind. Seemed happier than I was. And I myself was struggling with fitting in, finding friends and all - my class is really weird. When they are alone, they are bearable. But when my classmates are together, their collective hive mind is just so disgusting and toxic. It was annoying, There's another person, M, who took a liking to me for the exact same reason as R (albeit in other words). Throughout my whole life, I've always been able to intuitively tell who's who; some concepts of power dynamics as R used to say. And I just gravitated towards like minded people. I didnt feel like I 'vibed' with those that I feel are 'lesser'. But I could have fun, and that was the important stuff. 

R intensified the 'lesser' feeling. He called people like me and him 'smart', and as unwilling as I am to admit it, my naivety (which I have always had), fell for this charm. He always pointed out the 'smart' people, the people that could make something out of themselves, and the people who aren't 'smart' gravitate to (or get played by). I really wanted to know how to be him. Same thing with M, albeit more of me resisting it. With M, I used to get regular burnout. Both of these guys are narcissists for sure - I think I'm more empathetic. 

At the moment, I don't feel like I have a sense of concrete personality. When I am reminded of what I care about, I used to be indifferent - I used to force myself to care. Now, I am starting to get back into my own frame of mind. I feel a lot more negative nowadays tho. I don't empathise as much (but I am starting to), I don't think of solutions and ways to manipulate situations as much as I used to, I don't read between the lines and pick fishy things up as fast I as I used to, I keep comparing myself and what I do to literally everyone in my class, not just R or M. 

I don't even know if I really expressed myself in a way that would help you guys understand what I am going through. The only things that can calm me down is either music, or reminding myself of the good times I had in Dubai, or being reminded of why I do the things I do - my goal in life. My family. 

Please help me. I really don't know what I'm doing anymore and every single time I try to get a hold of my life I just somehow manage to fuck it up and start screwing up my mental. I wanna get back to the person I used to be. I don't wanna be a shell of the man that I was, when right now it's my family that needs me most. I've lost my interest in science, I lost my interest in maths, I can't even calculate some bullshit equation without being unsure of myself. How do you fix this? It's literal torture inside my head. I don't think I've ever been so anxious or whatever this is in my entire life. I don't want to peak in fucking high school man. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get my life back on track. Just please ask me to explain anything specifically if there's anything you feel missing.",11Aug2019,1
145,"I used to be EXTREMELY talkative, if anyone would listen to me, I’d be speaking. For the last year or so I’ve realised I talk too much.

I’ve had two social outings in the last 30 days and both times I saw people I haven’t seen in a year. I had no idea what to say. They’d ask me how I was and I would say good, and literally walk away. Or they’d talk about something and I’d just smile and walk away. I honestly don’t know how to speak to them or what to say anymore. I don’t want to stay like this.

148,"my mom is overbearing, dismissive of my personal issues, condescending, and berating. she flips out over my ""safety"" and needs to constantly be in control every minor thing, like when i eat, how i eat, my everyday routine. she will smother me with snacks and gifts and then in an hour call me ugly for no reason. she puts me down constantly. when i was little i watched her pull a knife out on herself, then me, then ran out of our apartment. i once argued with her because she wouldnt let me see my dad and she convinced she would drive me to his house but as soon as we hit the freeway she was yelling and started swerving the car and threatened to kill saying if she couldnt have me no one could. she tried to kill us in the car at least two more separate times growing up. that has stopped but i will never stop resenting her for it. i refuse to tell her personal details about myself and avoid spending time with her because i dont trust her. She says im clinging to the past but i will never forgive her especially since she is not sorry. everytime we talk about it she justifies her actions and says i couldnt understand her and its my job to be there for her. she lied to me about my dad, which left me partially estranged from him for my whole young childhood. he was always my favorite parent but i couldnt live with him full time until i was fifteen. however his wife never got over me. she  she made it too difficult to live with him and our relationship is broken again. she has always sabotaged everything since she married him. she told me to my face my dad loves her more. because all my siblings are on my fathers side, i dont have a close relationship with any of them. now that i am 18 he seems to not even care much about spending time with me anymore. it feels like he was just holding out til i grew up.

im a serial socializer and complete extrovert but i dont know how to keep people. ive never had a close relationship or friendship where i felt comfortable sharing things except for maybe my one best friend since third grade. i doubt if we had met so young and she had been exposed to things i was going through that we would have been able to connect. we have grown apart but hold a bond. she cant be there for me all the time.

ive had relationships ive pretended were healthy and intimate but they werent. i lied to myself. theres always an unbalance. my father and old friends have called me difficult to like because im high energy and lack a filter and poise. i often speak in jumbled broken sentences and i embarrassed them by for example laughing too loudly in the streets.

the way i get my social interaction is never by hanging out with good friends anymore but by meeting strangers and then quickly parting ways, or keeping an awkward acquaintance standing where we can be friendly but as soon as i start inching towards a closer relationship and thinking its safe to open up or build a real friendship, it ends. i get dropped or im the one who gets overwhelmed and disappears. 

i dont really trust anyone anymore. i dont have anyone in my corner. i dont know who i can turn to. i dont know what this means for my future, how i will be a mom, how i can ever be married, how i can have a healthy social group.

149,"""If I don't drink this glass of water in eight chugs my parents will die.""
Welcome to the mind of eight-year-old me.
And adult me, to be fair.

Great, yet another pointless post about a person who isn't even a frequent reddit user.
The truth is that I came here to pose a question, hopefully get a bit of help and delete my accoung afterwards because, honestly, even admitting this makes me incredibly uncomfortable.

Please keep in mind that I am not here to self-diagnose or get a ""diagnosis"" from anyone. 
It's just that I feel completely alone in it and feel like I need to know if there might be people that feel the same way.

Brace yourself, this will be a long text.

All my life I've incredibly concerned that something horrible will happen to my family. At age four my parents had to have long talks with me about how neither them nor I are going to die anytime soon and yet that lingering fear has always occupied my mind.
As a child I had a huge ritual that I'd perform each evening, a string of words by which I created a ""wall"" around everyone important to me in order to keep them safe. I must stress that I never, or at least not for as long as I can remember, believed that I was actually casting a magic wall or anything along those lines. It was just an urge I had in order to control the fear of someone dying. Nothing unusual for a child, I assumed, and maybe that's true.

Many children are afraid of the toilet flush, right? So maybe that's why I started to run out of the bathroom before it stopped in fear that something bad might happen to me or my family.

I remember that at some point I started to suddenly have to do everything twice. I had to take two steps at a time, always take an even number of chugs from a glass or steps through a room. Then twice became four times. Four times became eight times. It even got to a point where I repeated movements, which understandably freaked my parents out.

At some point when I read or saw something bad in a book or movie I started to jump afterwards. If I didn't, I told myself, the same bad thing would happen to me or a loved one.

Over the course of the years I've managed to overcome some of those things.
I took important changing points and dates in my life - finishing a school year, new year's eve, my birthday - to tell myself: ""From now on this will not have a bad effect anymore.""
And it worked - partially. I do not spend my evenings mentally setting up ""walls"" around everyone I know anymore. Hell, the mere thought of that makes me feel crazy.
I do not repeat the same movement over and over again to have an even number that ideally is around four or eight or sixteen, sixteen being the ""ideal"".

But these days I still jump after bad things in movies when I'm alone. Or after horrible thoughts.
I still cross the street in my hometown behind a certain sign and if a car passes by I feel like someone important to me will die.
I automatically take an even number of chugs out of a glass.
I always walk an even number of steps.
I leave the bathroom before the toilet stops flushing.
Hell, I accidentally threw my phone onto the ground because I told myself my SO would break up with me if I didn't throw everything in the air and jump - right there where I was on the open street.
Somw of those fears and rituals are connected to my hometown and house so I hope that it'll get better in autumn when I move to another city but I partially doubt it.

I am approaching my twenties and yet I flee from the flush in fear that my close ones will die.

Frankly, I'm feeling crazy.
I've talked about this to the person closest to me and understandably they've been confused.
I am not even a generally superstitious person - I KNOW that my behaviour is irrational and sometimes I can fight it. I can fight it in immediate situations in which my social life would otherwise be grestly impacted. I can apparently replace rituals with more harmless ones.

And yet. I've never met anyone with a similar problem and, frankly, I feel like a freak.
If anyone has advise on how to handle those thoughts or can simply show me that I'm not alone or crazy I'd be eternally thankful because, honestly, I don't know if I can ever eradicate this, no matter how hard I try.",11Aug2019,1
150,I am trying to come up with a list of self care activities that I can add to my daily life and some for when I need self care more than others. I would love to hear what everyone does for self care.,11Aug2019,5
151,"Hey please if you ever want to talk and or need prayers please ask! (Ephesians 4:32). You are struggling and don't know how else to deal with your pain. It's not your ""fault"" or something someone else and you are doing to hurt you. God wants to heal, wanting no one to perish but for all to come to repentance and belief in Christ Jesus our Lord. Galatians 6:2 says to ""bear one another's burdens.""
If you are struggling with self-harm yourself, please find help in a trusted adult right now. Even though these actions may seem like they help, they could eventually develop into even greater struggles like addictions to drugs, alcohol, or even eating disorders. In fact, you may be dealing with some of that right now. But, my friend, you don't have to suffer alone.
While all addictions are hard to overcome, help and treatment are out there and available—recovery and freedom are possible. We believe that no matter what you're wrestling with—self injury, depression, drugs and alcohol, body image issues, sexual addiction, or other areas of brokenness—God can heal all things (1 Peter 2:24; James 5:16; 2 Corinthians 4:16).
Is cutting linked to suicide?
Self-injury may not always be about attempting suicide, but the damage done while harming oneself always carries the risk of inflicting serious, and even lethal, results, regardless of whether suicide is intended or not. The continued cycle of addiction and self-harm, as in substance abuse and other eating disorders, can have a destructive effect on one's health both physically and mentally, and the struggles can worsen over time without treatment [2].
It's not too late to stop.
If you are practicing self-harm, please talk to counselor or pastor as soon as you can. Depression may be very real, but it doesn't have to be the end of your story. You have the power to make the choice to seek help and recover (Philippians 4:13). ""When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears, and rescues them from all their troubles"" (Psalm 34:17).
Cutting very often stems from a very low view of self, seeing yourself as worthless or invisible, which is totally countered and met by the reality of God's love. Listen to the words of Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew 11:28-30. He's talking to YOU: ""Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.""

Struggling in this world can be a good thing. We live in a fallen corrupt world/society. Pain and suffering can give you endurance, long suffering patience, and make you depend on Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior who died for our sins according to scripture, buried and rose again according to scripture. 

We must Repent and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ for the kingdom of God is a hand, Christ, God in flesh the Son of God is the one seeking, we are saved by grace through faith who God sent to willingfully die for our sins according to scripture, buried and rose again according to scripture (1 Corinthians 15:1-4, Romans 5:8, John 3:16, Romans 3:23-26, Ephesians 2:8-9, Isaiah 55:6-9)

Luke 19:10 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.

We are the ones hiding, dead and a slave to our sins. Luke 13:3 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
