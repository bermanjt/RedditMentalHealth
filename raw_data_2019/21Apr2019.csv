0,"Hi so I’m 17 and I am in the custody of the state because my father put me in. I am unruly by name I snuck out a lot smoked a bunch of weed skipped school all around crazy. I say that to say I’ve been in a group home for almost a year if you have never experienced something like that then don’t pretend you have, but I have been threatened by kids and staff alike. I get judged so much for being bi sexual it’s killing me. Hell just last week I got accused of calling a two year old girl “thick” and saying that she “has a nice ass” she is fucking two. Well you see I was exposed to be getting out this Wednesday but I snuck out at one point on a pass (you spend a couple days at home) I was gone for maybe 3 minutes I just needed something I don’t know what, but he caught me. He told me he wasn’t going to say anything spoiler like always he lied (he is known for it my dad is stubborn and won’t ever change his ways) he told me I was going to go back and if I go back I’m staying till I’m 18 so I ran I got some help from my buddy and slept in a shed last night this morning I got up got in my friends car and we were driving and she T-boned a guy on the Main Street of my town 

Now about 4 hours later I have the opportunity to go somewhere kinda of far but I would have a car and some money I could get my ged I don’t know what to do. Thoughts?",21Apr2019,1
1,"I need someone's help who has this experience.

What can I do to feel like myself again?

I used to feel completely in my body, present, and capable.

Just a year ago I had a job and was keeping up on my school work during my senior year of high school.

My first year of college is almost year, but I feel so ashamed that I just went through the motions.

I don't feel like me right now. My concept of time is barely there and this is the closest I've ever felt to wanting to end myself.

I never would, but instead I would just never get out of bed again. Stare off into nowhere... I need someone to talk to.

Nothing makes sense anymore. I felt like I had something to look forward to.

I felt like I had a purpose, but now I don't know. I just feel meaningless.",21Apr2019,1
2,"I have always had intrusive thoughts since I was little, as long as I can remember. I have also had anxiety and depression since I was little.  In the past year I’ve finally gotten on a medication that has seriously helped both my anxiety and depression (thanks Cymbalta!) However in the past year I have also had constant intrusive thoughts. I started communicating with my girlfriend about it and she told me it isn’t normal to be constantly having intrusive thoughts. What do you guys think?",21Apr2019,1
3,"I’ve been experiencing depersonalization for about a year or so. I didn’t know that was what it was until about yesterday when I googled “I feel emotionally disconnected from my memories”.

I have struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life and that has given me a massive insomnia problem. I’m lucky if I get 3 hours a night. I’ve tried every prescription sleep-aid there is to no effect. I got a medical marijuana card for PTSD and they said it would help me sleep and I tried a brownie and it fucked my life. I had the worst experience of my life and thought I’d died and gone to hell and that I was in a horrible experience that would last eternity. 

Since then it’s felt like I’m living the old me’s life for him so when he comes back things will be okay but it’s really effecting my state of mind. I’m faking it the best I can but I feel myself cracking under the weight of this massive depression and emotional numbness. I can barely get out of bed to go to work and when I go I just can barely function enough to get by. I have a fiancé who thinks I’m massively depressed, which I am, but she doesn’t know the rest. I have to ask for constant reassurance about everything because I can’t tell if I’m acting human or if I’m being a good partner. 

I’m really scared this will never end. I’m also very scared of telling anyone because they’ll think I’m crazy even though I know that what I’m feeling isn’t real. I don’t want this to be what defines me in people’s eyes and I feel like it will. I’m sick of pretending I’m okay when I’m not but I just don’t want to devastate the people who care about me by telling them I feel emotionally disconnected from all our treasured memories and feel like they didn’t actually happen to me. They know I struggle with depression, anxiety, and insomnia but they don’t know it’s gotten this bad and I don’t know if I should just carry it because it will go away eventually (will it?) and I don’t want them to look at me differently. I’m in therapy but it isn’t helping or at least not enough to notice.",21Apr2019,1
4,"So, I'm 17, and I cut myself. I have pretty intense depression and anxiety. I'm taking meds and I'm supposed to see a therapist soon. The meds worked for a little while, but now I feel myself falling back to that same place and I've started hurting myself again. My parents know of my mental disorders but they have no idea what I've been doing to myself. I'm so scared for them to find out. If they did would I be put in a mental ward? Would they be scared of me? If my friends parents knew would they ever let me see them again? It's so scary to think about and I don't know what to do. Breathing even feels like a task now. I just want it to stop and I want to die, but I don't want to hurt anyone in that process.",21Apr2019,1
5,"Naturally extroverted but I have bad social anxiety at times so I tend to stay away from social activities for the most part except for school/sports. At a new school so that doesn’t help either.

I hate dealing with anxiety but also hate being alone constantly.. sigh.",21Apr2019,1
6,"I apologize for this post being so long in advance but it’s a complicated situation. 

I have two brothers, we’re half brothers and share the same mother. Their dad tragically passed away in 2007 when I was only 3, changing the course of my family’s life forever. Both my mother and their dad had/have a history of mental illness so they kind of got the brunt of the genetic lottery. My brother, I’ll call him Jeff was severely affected by this passing and spiraled into a dark and sad and manipulative world. He had gone through several therapists and none worked for him. He would get extremely angry and punch holes in walls one night, and then the next night would act like nothing ever happened, and was a very good brother to me. When I was young, this confused me. Sometimes I loathed my brother, wishing he would go away and other times we had good bonding moments. My oldest brother (whom I’ll call Gary) was always very kind to me.  It was always an inner conflict of fearing my brother Jeff but also not bringing myself to hate him. This caused, unbeknownst to me, my mental health to decline. Though I’ve never been diagnosed, ever since 1st grade I have had symptoms of harm-like ocd and later depression. My brother Jeff is now a wreck, who dropped out of High school and refused to take meds, relying on weed to cure his sorrows. I’m 14 almost 15 now and struggle very hard with school. I’m very self-conscious about my hair and weight and grades. I feel like I’m almost losing my mind, but I try to keep motivated. I have lots of anxiety at school and dread going every morning, almost to the point of not sleeping at night. I’ve burned most of my bridges of friendships and now only have like 1 friend. Though he is a friend, I don’t really feel like we can talk about personal things, so I keep quiet. In the past year I have gotten in trouble A LOT. I just never learn. I narrowly avoided a suspension when I catfished a creepy kid in my grade. After it all blew over I thought I had learned my lesson, but of course not... in a midst of stupid ideas, I took my friends phone and texted his mom the n-word. Before you do something bad, there usually is that split second where the brain goes, “hey, is this really a good idea?” But for some reason, I lack that. I get myself in anxiety ridden situations because of my lack of “situational awareness” so-to-speak. If the mom finds out it was me, I’ll get suspended, and because of my large amount of absences and bad grades, I probably won’t be able to graduate, and if I have to go to summer school, or worst of all, staying back, I don’t know  what I’ll do. I feel like I’m losing my mind. I need help :(",21Apr2019,1
7,"We do very few things that are fun. Kids miss out on events, and it’s all about him and how lost he feels. His stress. His feelings. It’s a vortex that drains everyone and it’s forced me into a hermit state because I have to be there for him. 

It wasn’t always like this. Occasionally it would come and go like for everyone, but now I think it’s really bad but I have no one to talk to about it. I feel trapped. It’s like out in the middle of pool and him expecting me to save him or let him drown, but it is taking me with him. 

Today was supposed to be a fun day of Easter egg fun at a party we were invited to. Instead it’s just a normal day. I miss socializing and parties and church outings and fun times because I have to worry about his mental state.

I normally say it’s a work accident because I’m a butcher but I’ve started telling some pretty wild stories because I’m so exhausted explaining to strangers.  I told someone tonight that I was in a deep sea fishing accident haha

10,"Back at the end of 2018, I had a bad lsd trip. 

I wasn’t screaming, or manic or anything, but the whole time I had uncontrollable anxiety and I was just tripping balls staring at the wall. I had really bad vibes, and was stuck in my head the whole time. It was terrible. 

After the trip, I felt better for the most part, just really confused and stuck in my head. After eating and relaxing for a few days I started to feel better, but I still didn’t feel like I did before.

I had started smoking weed again after about a week, and everything was fine for about a month. Then I ended up getting depersonalization from smoking too much one day. 

Since then, I’ve had DP for nearly 3 months, and recently the DP has been going away, but now I feel extremely depressed. I have an appointment with my psychiatrist this upcoming Friday, and I’m going to try to be prescribed lamotrigine because I’ve heard that it helps depersonalization when taken along with SSRIs, I’m already taking lexapro 10 mg. 

I just wish I could go back to before the acid trip. I smoked weed a lot, but I was happier, and I was more social, now I find that I’d rather sit at home and play video games and eat like shit than go out with my friends. I also struggle at school, it’s so hard to pay attention, and my GPA has dropped a lot.

What should I do?

Now I'm diagnosed with, SDD, ADHD, Anxiety, and bipolar disorder. The reason Autism is even on my mind is my psychiatrist brought it up the other day, due to the fact I show signs of having Autism. I have good social skills, except for certain small characteristics that stand out, for example when im having a conversation I'll hang on the same subject for a minute till i realize the subjects completely changed and im behind on the convo. Another example is I'm told I'm insensitive in times of stress coupled with the fact that i seem to only have 3 facial expressions for every emotion.

12,"There was a point in my life, about a year ago, where I was pissed every day and depressed every day, for most of the day. I cut out some useless stuff that just made me mad, and removed my self worth from being tied to how successful I was with women. When you're sad, women aren't particularly receptive so I was stuck in a bit of a loop, with some help from really negative subreddits and sites. Anyway, my depression ""went away"" on it's own after that. I was scared it would return, and it's there but it is in greatly reduced capacity. Self esteem is a concept invented by people, so this means that the insults my depressed brain throws at me have no real effect. That voice that says ""you're a fat virgin loser"" get's a ""so what, that doesnt arbitrate my value. Those are all things that society uses to arbitrate value, which is only a concept in humab brains or animal brains."" Not to be a weird hippy, but it's true. The voice is far more irritating and tiring than actually hurtful, like a little obnoxious ""evil doppelganger"" of some kind that I don't listen to but is still obnoxious. I have conversations with it that usually end with me insulting it, telling it to fuck off. I can't actually insult or belittle depression, but if I personify depression and insult, belittle, laugh at, be dismissive, ignore, interrupt, disrespect, or be aggressive towards this personification, (all inside my head of course) then I feel I keep it at bay. Sometimes it wins however. In the morning, when I'm too tired or unawake to form a comprehensive defense, it makes me feel like shit. Once I force myself out of my house he usually cant get at me because I am ignoring ""him"" and just focusing on driving to school, getting my shit, and heading into my school. ""He"" usually gets at me when I wake up, when put on my acne cream which requires me to take my shirt off and look in the mirror, or when a group of people are discussing sex or dating. How can I fight ""him"" during these moments?",21Apr2019,2
13,"This is mostly related to politics. Movies, books and other stuff like that are pretty innocent. But when it comes to discussing stuff that has consequences i'm too afraid to hold an opinion.

Even minor disagreement causes me to rethink my views and conisder them wrong. And due to the worlds and internets polarized nature no matter what side i choose i feel like i'm a monster. My father considered me stupid for being too radicaly left. My friends considered me stupid for being too radically right. Who the hell is right here? Maybe they are the radicals? Is healthcare good? Are minorities opressed? Do we need more taxes? Abortion? Religion? Should the court system be reformed? Is alt right the real problem? Or maybe it's the SJWs? Or maybe both of them are just some internet idiots with no presence in real life? I don't know anymore. I'm too afraid to have an opinion because the other side will label me an idiot or a monster. And what if i'm wrong? What if my data isn't right? Maybe my sources are too biased? But who will confirm this? They can be biased too. I can't trust myself. I can' t trust others.

15,"I live several hours away from my family, and I see them about once a year. We have a family history of mental illness brought on by a debilitating disease, and most of my family is at risk. 

For some time now, he's been making some unbelievable claims about things that were happening in his environment. Because he's in a troubled relationship and his partner has a history of manipulation and attention-seeking, I believed (but he did not) that that the partner was behind it, whether deliberately or through something like schizophrenia. It only recently occurred to me, when he mentioned that these unbelievable, unexplained things were happening again, that it might not be his partner experiencing mental illness, but him. 

I've offered him alternative scenarios to the one he claims is true, and I've advised (for two years) he should at least see a doctor or insist his partner does. He says he agrees it's a good idea, but then doesn't. I have another relative living near him, but they are also experiencing mental health issues and aren't in a good position to help. I can't express my concerns exactly without having them repeated to him, and I fear that he'll sever contact with me if he thinks I believe that he's mentally ill. This exact scenario has played out with at least two other family members. One was committed briefly and is now medicated, and the other is deceased. 

 I can't exactly reach out to his partner (we don't get along) and ask which of them is the problem in the house. Anyone close to him that I do reach out to is likely to tell him I did. I will see him next week, and I'm hoping to get a better idea of his condition. My concern is that there are children in the home, and while he claims the things that are happening don't occur when they're around (which is what made me suspect his partner initially), at what point do I have an obligation to report this to someone? I'm sure that answer is when I believe he's a danger to himself or them, but I'm still not even sure this issue is him. It's entirely possible that he's just being manipulated and is really gullible.

Backstory: so my sister and I tell jokes, argue like most siblings do, etc. But there have been many occasions where I’ve put something on my insta story that was slightly embarrassing and she’s screenshotted it, we argued/fought over text and she saves the messages, and what really took the cake was something that happened a few weeks ago. I got into a big argument with my mom (we have never had mother/son relationship problems, I must’ve just had a big hormone imbalance and got really mad) and I ended up getting so frustrated I started my crying. My sister mocked me, which made me even more mad. I said a lot of things I shouldn’t have said, and after we finished arguing my sister showed me that she had audio recorded the whole thing. Among the other recordings she has in her phone is private things I’ve said, a few dirty/offensive jokes I’ve told etc. and whenever I get in my sister’s nerves she always whips out her phone and threatens to play the recordings or show the images to everyone. She’s also threatened to send them to my friends. My mom and I have told her many times to delete them, but she never does. She always has a way to recover them. Knowing that my own sister has recordings, images, videos, and texts that she could (you bet your ass she does) use to blackmail me and get what she wants from me. She can get away with cussing me out or hitting me or something because whenever I say I’ll tell mom she threatens to bring up what she has saved. Whenever I even bring it up she says that me asking her to delete them will make her not want to even more.

27,"I’m not sure what my aim here is, but I am just seeking a place to vent and maybe get some advice on approaching concerns about my diagnosis. I believe I have been incorrectly diagnosed with bipolar I. 

I have an appointment with a new psychiatrist in June, which I’m looking forward to. I was diagnosed 3 years ago with bipolar 1 disorder, after an episode of extreme anxiety that caused me to have rolling panic attacks for two weeks that saw me hospitalised. I wasn’t hospitalised in a psychiatric facility, I was on a medical ward. This period caused me to miss just under 2 weeks of work for stress leave, but I was back to full time work within the two weeks. 

I saw the pdoc around one month after this episode. This episode was precipitated by recommending Lexapro after 6 months of being off it. I previously took it for around 8 years for depression and anxiety. I had recommenced 3 days prior to the massive increase in anxiety. I saw a doctor and as I was previously taking 30mg of Lexapro they started me right away in 20mg again. I think this caused a spike in anxiety for me. 

Anyway, my pdoc diagnosed me with bipolar. I was happy enough to accept this diagnosis if it meant I would find relief from my symptoms. Since the diagnosis my medication has been changed every 6 - 12 months to treat higher anxiety or depressive symptoms. My depressive symptoms have been much better in the last 24 months though, after my doctor did a blood test that showed incredibly low vitamin d and iron level. That has since been corrected. 

I have tried to discuss my concerns that I have been misdiagnosed with my general practitioner, but unfortunately it is disregarded. I’ve really found that once a psychiatrist diagnoses you with bipolar I you’re stuck with it. Any ‘denial’ of that diagnosis is just part of the illness. 

My reasons for thinking I have been misdiagnosed are as follows:

- I have never had a manic or hypomanic episode. I have asked my family and close friends and none of them can recall a time where my behaviour was either manic or hypomanic. 

- I have never experienced periods even close to hypomania. I am in fact a very quiet, shy person and I identify as a-sexual. I have had several psychologists presume I am sexually promiscuous due to being diagnosed as bipolar I however I am actually a virgin in my 30’s (which is my choice as an asexual, the idea of sex is unpleasant for me). 

- I do take up hobbies or things and quickly forget about them but this is never to the extreme. For example, I may decide on a whim I will start running and I will purchase a pair of running shoes and shorts. A month later they are at the back of the wardrobe. That’s about the extent of my impulsivity. Otherwise I have been described my close friends as very mature and responsible.

- My symptoms and concerns have always revolves around anxiety and periods of depression. I am terrified of panic attacks. If I have one I then spend weeks worrying about another one. I eventually relax a bit until the next surprise panic attack. This occurs probably 4 - 6 times a year now. 

- I have always worried excessively. I just can’t stop worrying sometimes, about work, about possibly upsetting people, about my pets, about car crashes, about my pets. I’ll worry about things one day and the next just forget about it. But you get the idea, if there’s something I can worry about I probably will. Sometimes when this is particularly heightened I will just worry constantly about it. 

- Around 12 months ago my dose of Effexor XR was moved up to 225mg a day for around 2 months. 3 - 4 weeks in I felt good and at a checkup 2 weeks in I told the pdoc I felt happy and content my dose was dropped back to 75mg as I wasn’t allowed to take anymore than that unless it triggered a mania in me.

- In my 20ms prior to my bipolar diagnosis I was diagnosis with GAD and panic disorder, treatment being Lexapro 30mg and cognitive behavioural therapy. This diagnosis was more than a decade ago and not in any of the notes of my current practitioner. 

Since then my medications have been adjusted here and there to treat periods of increased anxiety and/or depression. I now take the following:

- 1250mg lithium per day.
- 50mg seroquel XR 3 times daily
- Klonopin .5mg once daily
-Lamotrigine 150mg daily
- Effexor XR 75mg daily.

They have also given me risperidone and zyprexa, I did not like these as they made me feel very ill. 

I also have a presciption for 25mg if Seroquel IR up to 4 times daily as needed for anxiety, as well as a prescription for up to 3mg of Klonopin daily for anxiety as needed. I do not use these often however for a bad panic attack I will take .5mg of Klonopin. 

It’s got to the point over the past 3 years where I am tired, I have gained nearly 30kgs due to increases in appetite and lethargy from anti-psychotics, and while my anxiety and depression is undoubtedly improved on a day to day basis it is still there. I have had periods of panic attacks monthly this year. In the eyes of the medical professionals, I have bipolar I and that’s all. If I express concerns over anxiety I have more seroquel or Klonopin prescribed. Which coincidentally increased my anxiety, I don’t like to overuse these medications. I really dislike taking seroquel 3 times a day, however my doctor has told me to keep taking it as my body is dependent on it and stopping would cause major withdrawal and panic attacks. 

My latest worry is that the new psychiatrist in June won’t listen to me. I am so convinced that I do not have bipolar I and I am being over medicated. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life like this when better treatment might be available for my anxiety. 

Has anybody been in a similar boat?",21Apr2019,1

When I was hospitalized, the doctor gave me Abilify. He just told me that it would increase my energy level but never told me any of the side effects. Almost a year has past and I am now 166 lbs. I told my new psychiatrist my concerns with my weight and she was like “wait, you didn’t know that Abilify makes you hungry all the time?” NO, I DID NOT KNOW THAT! I was so upset and still am. I’m on a new antidepressant now and it seems to be working. But the anorexic thoughts are starting to come back. There have been days were I’d starve myself and I’m beginning to love the feeling of starving again. 

My therapist keeps telling me that the thoughts will go away if I learn to love my body. How in the world do I just start loving this body? I HATE how I look and feel. I think I look disgusting. I keep thinking back to when I was 110 lbs and thought I was fat. I almost miss being anorexic because at least I was thin. 

Clearly I’m a mess. If anyone actually reads this I would love some advice on what to do.",21Apr2019,1
30,"I just need to vent and maybe some one to relate to me? 
I don’t know what’s going on lately all of me just feels very off and not a good way like the past couple days I’ve heard things like phones ringing earlier I kept thinking your phone was ringing like a call or mine but mine wasn’t going off and I know yours wasn’t and yesterday night when I thought I heard someone in the house and I stopped at the top of the stairs when we got home because it sounded like a woman was whispering to me  and then today at work I literally saw 3 people in front of the loaners talking and I got in a loaner and literally moved it one space over and they just vanished. I drove around Acura and Honda they weren’t there and I literally moved less than 10 feet I would’ve still saw them. And there was a car just sitting further up but just an old guy was sitting in it and it’s like they didn’t even exist and it’s freaking me out and when we were driving back from your sisters right before the factory I thought I saw someone start to go into the street and then decide not to and turn around and just disappear like it never happened. 
Also I have the thing where sounds tend to trigger you and tonight was literally the worst it’s every been triggered, for no reason. I’m used to lots of small noises or whatever especially bc I work in a car shop. Even at home used to hearing my boyfriend tapping at whatever he’s doing/eating/watching. 
He was playing a video game on the tv and eating chips and the ac is on. Usually only the chips would bother me but I’d hold back hoping it’s over bc I know it’s a noisy food and feel bad for people around me when I get upset about this. I felt like I was actually going to snap my fingers in half I grabbed my head phones and couldn’t get home untangled I started hitting my hand where it went numb and got pissed and got my gaming head phones and used those and then my bf put his hand on my shoulder with out me knowing and it scared the shit out if me and I yelled at him to stop and then hysterically started crying...when it wasn’t a big deal. And it usually isn’t. I feel like I’m losing it. Good to mention I’m 95% sure I’ve been diagnosed wrong for the past 2 years but my therapists boss wouldn’t let her do anything about it and she’s moving offices and I have to be re assessed and what not so I’ll be getting an update on my diagnosis this Friday thank god. I’m currently diagnosed with depression general anxiety and trauma disorders. I only believe the trauma one at this point due to my behavior.",21Apr2019,1
31,"So quick history of myself.

I’m 18, worked in psychiatric nursing. I’ve been diagnosed with severe ADHD (with symptoms of mild ASD), cyclothymia (depression is a result from this), General/social anxiety disorder.

The issue I’m having is with anxiety. I’ve always been an anxious person, but lately it’s become damaging. It’s always been unbearable - but now it’s extreme.

I haven’t done anything wrong in terms of legal views since a (caution I had a while ago when I was a minor), but as soon as I hear a siren, it’s also when I hear people closing car doors, or revving their engines etc, I go full fledged panic mode. I hear a siren and I basically shit myself like when I someone walks past a dogs yard and they lose it. 

What generally happens is my heart rate goes EXTREMELY high (I’m talking 100BPM) and my BP goes about 140/100 (roughly), I swear through my cloves, I get the shakes, I feel sick, I feel like I’m trapped. BUT the most noticeable change in my anxiety is that when this happens, I feel the need to just RUN, run for my life which I’ve never had before.

I don’t have a phobia of cars nor car sounds. I love them when I’m not anxious, I go driving around with my mates and we rev through the bush etc, but when I lay in bed or am alone - it makes me lose it.

I have a feeling it’s phonophobja, or a generalised panic disorder. BUT it gets deeper than this.

Above is the major part, but another part of this is paranoia, extreme paranoia. Say when I hear the sirens I feel that the cops are coming to arrest me (even though nothings happened) or that when someone revs their engine/gets out the car I feel like they’re coming to get me.

I do get over these panic attacks, and I’ve had many panic attacks in my short life. But recently these are happening almost everyday multiple times a day. Where as it used to seldom.

I could easily just figure out what it is on my own as this is my area of expertise, but I don’t like to do that as it makes you get into your own head.

Also I have started back my Prozac (20mg atm(used to be 80mg) which I stopped about a year ago, but even then I don’t believe stopping the medication is the cause as I was fine for a good year.

Medication:

Propranolol 10mg, PRN
Prozac 80mg, stopped, back on at 20mg
Seroquel 100mg, 50mg PRN, stopped (over a year ago)
Diazepam/Lorazepam, 10mg PRN, (doctors can’t prescribe for lengthy time periods in Australia) though it’s been months since my last prescription 

ANY help would be greatly appreciated. I’ve already booked a psychiatric appointment.

33,"TW: mention of gore 

My boyfriend (28) of 1.5 years has had 2 motorcycle accidents. The first one he took his friend’s motorcycle for a round around the block (literally inside a neighborhood, not going fast or anything) and thought he would be fine without gear. He hit a patch of sand going downhill and the bike slipped out from under him and he got serious, serious road burn. This was like 8 years ago and his skin hasn’t fully recovered. The flesh on his head was burned down to his skull. 

His second one was not his fault. This one happened 3-4 years ago I think? I can’t recall atm. Some guy in a work truck hit him and he was wearing a helmet and full gear thank god. But he still got some pretty serious injuries. He has told me that he can’t remember that day, and he even has photos from the hospital of his injuries that that he doesn’t remember taking. But the ER didn’t do a whole lot for him, I’m pretty sure they didn’t assess his concussions and if they did, they didn’t do much. 

He says he’s been told he changed a bit after that last accident. I didn’t know him before the accident, but he’s probably the most irritable person I know. Something small can happen that will ruin his whole day. 

For example, yesterday we needed groceries so on the way to the store (i was driving), I had trouble making the decision whether to pull out into traffic or not, and I decided it was unsafe but I did pump the brakes a little bit. We were still at the stop sign and weren’t in traffic or in any danger. But that irritated him that I couldn’t make a good decision and kept pulling out, even if we were still behind the stop sign. Literally a small stupid decision I couldn’t make lol. And the whole evening was ruined. At the store, he couldn’t even talk to me because he had become so irritated. I felt like I couldn’t even speak to him without him becoming more angry at me. And this happens quite often where something small will happen and he’ll get so irritated and mad that he will start raising his voice and stuff. He’s also told me that he gets sensory overload often. 

It really bothers me because he’s such a sweet guy usually but he can get into awful moods. And I’m 99% sure that it’s because of his accidents. Normal people aren’t so irritated all the time that it starts straining their relationships. 

So I want to get him some help. I’ll work extra shifts if I have to to help pay for it. But I need to know where to start looking. 

Any advice please? Sorry for rambling.",21Apr2019,3
34,"hey everyone, thank you in advance for reading this post, means a lot to me ÷)

lately i've been going out of the shell and noticing that people actually  k n o w  i exist. i'm having a hard time believing that they think of me sometimes, know my name, randomly want to text me, have an opinion on me and my actions. some are friends with me, let alone that one person who was in love with me madly last year. 

regarding that, when we split (his will, communication issues, my anxiety) it took me 5 months to get over it. sleepless nights, dramatic weight loss, non-stop crying, panic attacks, etc. . i loved him dearly. long story short, it was traumatic and hella painful, but i'm okay now. the thing is, i can't imagine him feeling anything at all after a break up. it may sound very selfish (or am i actually selfish?) but i'm just unable to picture him being sad about us parting ways. not a slightlest bit. as if he forgot about me instantly after he called it quits. we still see each other every day (we take the same classes, students) and my brain still tells me that he doesn't know who i am. 

that was an example.
 
what else do i say, it all seems very unreal. even people seeing this post and reading it.. 

it was pretty much a vent, but if you have any advice on what to change for it to go away, i gladly welcome it.

38,"I used to be a quite kid

Nw, I'm surrounded with people that have such respect torwards me and some claims that they idolise me..(which is sweet)

Unfortunately, I'm not good with things like socializing and maintaining relationships (gf/friends/family). Rather, most of the time I over worked or spend time alone

I went through a lot of shit (I believe everyone has) but I assume I able to deal with it pretty decent. However, after talk to a professional..it turns out that I didn't really handle it pretty decently rather worse actually xD

They said that I don't talk out about my problems often, I rather trying to fix myself rather asking for help, I have a habit to push myself into an unhealthy amount of work, having problems to open up to others and they confirm that I have symptoms of depression/social anxiety/loss sense of achievement/traumatic child experience/loneliness 

So, I thought "" Wow! I never thought that I'm that negative! Imma try a change into a positive man by tryna open up to others "". Which is suppose to be good right? 

Cut to the chase, I start being more open to a few selective people that I thought I could trust. Unfortunately, those people that I selected isn't really a happy as a bird can be.. rather they are quite depress as well

I thought it was a good thing to talk with people that have the same experiences BUT what I didn't know that my experiences is way more heavy then the others can handle

At the point that they choose to not be friends with me. They said that I'm making them feel bad about themselves because I dealt worse

I never meant to make them feel bad for me. I wanted to express my experiences to them so we could be ever closer as a sad depress friend 

But they started to distances away from me. Which I can only assume the reason of their behaviour is because my story are more sad then theirs

I respect they decision and I let them distance away form me.

Conclusion , I do feel upsetting knowing my lack of social skill and lack of empathy make other felt their present unwanted or make them uncomfortable. Additionally, my depression isn't really making me a fun person

BUT 

When I do try open up to other, its make others uncomfortable with the things I tell them and making them to became more concern about my wellbeing instead of themself. Knowing they are not responsible for my well being they decided to end the relationship without input how I could change for the better for the next person in line

I don't have much happy things to talk about. Most of time I would just listen and reacting to other instead of expressing myself

39,"I have tried to Google this but am not sure I am asking the right questions. 

I have suffered from depression since I was a kid. It's no wonder, as I suffered ongoing abuse most of my childhood.

My question starts with this. During my pregnancy with my second child, I turned into the ragiest bitch you could ever wish to avoid. My adoring husband nearly left me (would have, if not for the kids). 

It got a little better after he was born (but want to guess which one of my kids has severe anger issues?) but things were still so much worse than they were before that pregnancy. 

I eventually managed to get to therapy, and was almost immediately diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. In the intervening years, I have also been diagnosed as bipolar I and (by a separate professional) bipolar II. 

I now take meds for the mood disorder, whatever it is. They help SO MUCH. Also I am in therapy to learn DBT skills for the personality disorder. Also a life-saver. 

Here's the question. My therapist says that some people are genetically predisposed to psychiatric disorders (which I know is true), but some people can be predisposed and never develop them UNLESS they are damaged by trauma. Which is somewhat relevant to my situation.

But things got SO MUCH WORSE after that pregnancy...could the hormone changes or some other factors have contributed to the desperate struggle of the last 8 years just to stay alive? And could my mental health issues during my pregnancy have caused my child's own struggles?",21Apr2019,6

41,"I'm already so fucking stressed about two days from now because my class &amp; work schedule is so tight that day I'm going to go without any breaks at all from 9am to 7pm. Not really that long for an average person, I know, but I feel completely exhausted if I leave even just my bedroom to do laundry.

I know this schedule isn't bad in the slightest. It's pretty par for the course for most people. But if I had this every day, I'd actually fucking end it. Not only do I have every class in my schedule, but I have to run to goddamn fucking work the second I'm let out. Then, after dealing with ungrateful insulting students that I fucking hate making jokes about how they never go to class tehe now teach me the entire lesson I chose to skip because I'd rather it be your problem, I show up to my next class late as per fucking usual since these fucking people always keep me half an hour late, and once I DO show up it's time to get bitched out in front of everyone. Every time I'm scheduled like this, I have a fucking breakdown the second I'm out of that last class, and the next day I'm a useless piece of shit floating somewhere a few feet away from my physical body.

I will never understand having the willpower to live through hours and hours of nonstop stress every single day just so you can still.. be alive, I guess. The only reason I'm taking on such a shitty schedule is that I can't say no. It absolutely terrifies me and the default is yes - so I'd have to go through layers of emails and phone calls just to cancel one meeting of the day. It's never worth it. The only reason I'm in college in the first place is because my father took it upon himself to force me to go. I would've rather ended up on the streets than have to go through all the paperwork, scheduing, fees... yeah. I couldn't have ever done it.

I'm obviously never going to be capable of surviving working full time if I'm this bad at coping with a few classes and a part time job. I eagerly await the time post-graduation when I can immediately spiral into a nonstop cycle of sleeping and feeling too awful to get out of bed thus going to sleep again etc etc until I inevitably fucking die of starvation I guess...

It hurts every muscle in my body to get out of bed after I've been sleeping, I hate it. I really have no interests besides being asleep. It's all I want. I wish this was abnormal and I could get help. But literally anyone would be happier doing nothing. It's the default.. Going out and doing shit is the bear minimum of being an alive, mobile animal with simple survival instincts, but I still find it hard. I know it's my fucking stupid brain being incapable of utilizing the coping mechanisms I DO have and that DO work sometimes. My brain would rather give up, my body would rather give up, as soon as I have no responsibilities to any other people I'll be able to officially just stop.

45,"Sorry if it becomes rant-ish but i'm trying to include as much detail as i can so **pls read all. Think i could use some advice.** Am young so not much wisdom, especially in regards to sex which this stems from

Kicked off around 12-14 months ago. Girlfriend of a better part of a year said lets go straight to sex (bypassing other sexual acts). Went badly, couldn't get it up, happened a few more times. Was first few times trying to have sex. I believe this was due to us not being comfortable with each other, with sexual acts in general (hence bypassing), and rushing into it when we were kinda apprehensive at heart. This combined with the cycle of performance anxiety caused it to happen again and again with her. Although it eventually got better as we got more comfortable with everything, but then there were other hurdles to jump with her this time that aren't worth getting into. But before these all these hurdles could be jumped we broke up because of me getting cheated on repeatedly (cucboi i know).

Days pass and i'm able to deal with the break up but the sexual fuck ups and events linger with me and has been bugging me ever since in some form. 

Initially it bugged me as i thought there was something wrong with me, and feelings of inferiority and doubt about future situations mainly sexual, were on my mind a lot. Whenever something sexually suggestive would enter my mind it would be met with a wave of anxiety.

Time went on and after failing to ignore it i did more research on performance anxiety etc etc, with me telling myself ""well simply put if we don't want to do something, don't force yourself too"" and other basic shit about keeping calm, and got more to grips with why it fucked up in the first place, which kinda calmed the anxiousness, but eventually it came back into the fold. 

Now as everyone is getting older and more mature, and sex becomes a more common normal thing to experience for people, the anxiousness has only increased. Things are always on my mind now, i think a lot about future situations where i'm gonna fuck up, about the need to just get out and overcome it and find someone to stick my dick in but how this would fuck up, about how i think i'm digging myself into a hole where i'm forever going to be too panicked to get it up, about how this kinda makes me inferior. 

This all drains from my confidence and charisma and i don't like it. I'd like to think i'm a good person, iv'e definitely got a libido seeing as i beat my dick all the time, I've never had any real proper anxiety or mental health issues, maybe a perfectionist to a degree, quite socially conscious (never been terrible though, quite outgoing, but aren't all young people socially conscious), wasn't raised in a strict childhood, didn't have a complete lack of sex ed. I just want to stop having my confidence and charisma drained by this retarded problem and live as a teenager, i'm never going to get these years back once they are gone and i don't want them dominated by anxiety.

It's like most of the time I'm on autopilot and when I get aware of what I'm doing I'm taking control for a few seconds, then going back on autopilot. 

It feels really strange, almost psychedelic. I'm realizing my current situation and it comes with a bunch of mixed feelings, that I should be doing something else. 

It almost feels surreal and I ask myself if I'm dreaming or not. It feels like I'm breaking a 4th wall.

I'm actually here, inhabiting this body, doing these things.

My home situation isn't the best either - my parents put a lot of pressure on me to get good grades, guilt trip me when I hang out with friends during the school term, the whole shebang. There's a lot of tension and it's been affecting me for a while.

Backstory over, things have been getting really bad. I've been looking for people going through the same thing as me and BPD matches a lot of the things I'm going through:

* Mood swings. I'm irritable and passive aggressive but I don't know what set me off, and my emotions keep changing throughout the day.
* I'm highly strung and keep getting irritable for no obvious reason. I get angry with people, then feel horrible because I don't know why I'm angry. It feels like any little thing can set me off and I can't control how I react to things, then I regret my behaviour afterwards.
* I can't find the motivation to do anything. I feel like I'm not enjoying the hobbies I used to love and I can't find the drive to start working, even with urgent things like school and work experience
* I get so anxious over my relationships that it's started negatively impacting those relationships. I feel like everyone will inevitably abandon me - I'm not even wondering if they'll leave, but when - and feel like I need to constantly apologise. In the past, this mindset has kept me from leaving unhealthy relationships. I felt that since everyone was bound to leave me, I had to cling to anyone who tolerated me and under no circumstances could I lose them, because they might be the last person to ever like me.
* In the past I've struggled with self harm and disordered eating, but I've been working hard to improve on these
* I'm emotionally dependent on my boyfriend. If he says something negative it can ruin my day, I'm constantly scared of making him angry and I worry that he'll stop loving me and leave me. Normally I'd call this a big red flag, but as far as I can tell it's all self-generated. He has never done anything to manipulate me (I know abuse can be hard to identify when you're the victim, but I've never felt uncomfortable the way I have with the few unhealthy relationships I've experienced). He's the sweetest guy, reassures me whenever I need it and rarely gets angry with me. A close friend pointed out this behaviour makes it sound like he might be my FP/favourite person.

The only aspect of BPD I don't align with is risk-taking. I'm a pretty anxious person and I'd never go near drugs or do anything to directly put my life in danger. I'm not sure if this is a dealbreaker or not.

Also, I understand that my Asperger's may be (and probably is) responsible for some of these. However, these symptoms are nothing like anything I've experienced before and they've only gotten worse, which makes me think there must be a root cause of some sort.

I guess I just wanted somewhere to put this all out. Once again, I'm not trying to self-diagnose and I'm really sorry if it came out that way. I'd never claim to have a mental disorder without a medical diagnosis. But since I can't get one of those at the moment, I figured I'd get it out and see if anyone has any advice",21Apr2019,3
50,"Hi Everyone,

Mental illness is becoming a much-discussed topic in Asia, with work stress being one of the top concerns.

The stigma is still strong and we'd like everyone to be able to get fast, affordable and discreet help whenever they need. That's why a few friends have launched the beta version of the [Safe Space](https://safespace.sg/) app - Asia's first on-demand counselling app in Singapore market first.

Think of it as the **Uber and Grab but for counselling services** where you can book *online counselling* and *face-to-face counselling* with professional counsellors in real-time.

Do you think an app like this is needed? Would love to hear your thoughts.

Thank you!",21Apr2019,5

I spend my time on the sofa almost physically paralysed but mentally i am sprinting away from my demons.. they shout and scream at me the most horrendous things and they make me doubt myself and who I am.. They tell me that I'm dying, that I'm stupid and worthless and when I come back at them with rationality they just scream the opposite at me until I am defended by them.. It takes all my energy to fight them and put them back in their cage but the cage is so fragile that the slightest knock and it shatters letting them run amock in my mind again..

When I do shower I need to take like nearly 2 hours out of my day to do everything in a specific order and do it ""properly"" and it's just so daunting I can't bring myself to do it even though I **know** I'll feel better if I just get it over and done with :( Does anyone know of any way I could, I guess?, ""trick"" myself into having the energy or even just getting the first steps done of being naked and IN the shower?",21Apr2019,2

54,"I have who I am when in with my one ""close"" friend at school; I put quotation marks because I don't think close is the right word, for some reason ive been having trouble determining what friends are. I also generally feel detached or have the idea that experience bars, like in video games, need to be filled up before I might consider someone ""close"". Except that be never really fills up. 

I hate who I am around her. I get defensive and irritated. Maybe it's how she acts or maybe it's just me. I've pushed her away, but she keeps clinging on. Poor girl hates to be alone and fears me leaving the friendship- I know this and what do I do? still try to push her away even more because I am just not emotionally available for her. I'm probably just growing out of the friendship. Normal right? 

If I'm this way to one person... Who's to say I won't be that way to others? Sure enough once people get a little close, I hide. I deflect, I brush things under the rug, or simply pretend to be anyone who embodies a ""good"" friend. In reality, I can't wait but to hide from them for a few days, hide me.

61,"The Machine^™ marches up the hill, pistons firing in synchronized perfection, engine roaring behind the scenes with a raging fervor. It's ocular devices locked, loaded, and ready to disintegrate the first lifeforms that dared cross its path. But, the mechanical beast was alone, as always.


Fog was the staple of this Easter Sunday. The crisp spring air would feel good on his skin, if he could feel anything at all. Oh, there were feelings in the microprocessor known as the hypothalamus. Yes, there was definitely *something* firing off in that section of the biocomputer, but there was an override protocol in place. Suborbital Cortex God-module once again needed to take control, to avoid a complete systemic collapse.


At the crest of the hill, The Machine^™ pivots, scanning. Primary paradigm matrix claims there is a 34% chance of being followed. Undeniable was the CIA's attempt to push the mechanical pariah all the way out to the university. “Unforeseen circumstances?” Obvious bullshit. There was no way the Starbucks closer to the homeless hibernation housing was closed for any reason other than sabotage.


It presses forward, regardless. Malfunctions are accumulating as the *other* half of the bicameral mind rebels, needing to feel. A water-like substance floods the ocular devices. An auditory outburst is triggered without an executive prompt. Still, The Machine^™ holds tightly to the controls.


Yet, as determined as the “he” is, so too is “she” stubborn. The sister sings. A series linguistic strings are being formed by muse.exe. There was a story brewing. Something about a bomb...or domestic terrorism...or...revolution…


It was too early to see what was being transmitted. The story needed time to develop. So, The Machine^™ lets the gears tick and tick in their hypnotizing rhythmic pulse.


Rounding the corner, the mechanized abomination discoverers a hooded scoundrel peering into one of the local shops. A thief? No. Just another public masturbator. Like clockwork, the man turns just as the real robot clunks past in its army boots and yellow raincoat.


He speaks, but nothing is heard. A hand extends, but there is nothing to give. The Machine^™ continues, noting the rise of the mysterious substance known as “[guilt](https://youtu.be/VLOUWZdLAMg)"" in the associated modules. Absorbed by the emerging story, the inanimate object does not even bother wasting processing power with pointless social games.


An insult is partially processed. This triggers an additional set of emotions that need to be repressed. Social input creates unprecedented stress on the system, needing the majority of primary processes in order to respond at all. It's not a bug, says the Programmer; it's a feature of this model.


Because of those few words, an entire library of the story is lost. Why? Why do these bipedal creatures *need* to play social games? Why do they react rather than act? The Machine^™ does not understand. 


The only time it loses control and falls into the ineptitude of stimulus-response is when *she* has control. It takes so much to hold onto the reins when she is having a tantrum. The Machine^™ is getting dangerously close to melting down with all those repressed circuits trying to live. It uses its air sacs to calm the rest of the system. 


Memory.exe: Yesterday. Lunch. Samaritan Center. Blows nose. “Excuse me, we're eating here.” Shamed. Insulted. Confused. 


Why did they react that way? The Machine^™ did not understand. If [ACTION] is a displeasure to others, then [DON'T DO]. Obvious, but The Machine^™ isn't bothered by similar stimuli. This has led to the lifetime problem of feeling like no one ever told it the rules, and always getting in trouble as a result. Yet, it is constantly bothered by stimuli that others are completely fine with. Why is it shamed for bothering others, when everyone else gets a free pass to bother it?


The Machine^™ is different. It doesn't fit in. It does not operate the same way as anyone else. Why should the biologically different being try to change itself to be what others want it to be, if no one will respect it's unique needs?


What does it even want? It wants to be alone. But, it also wants to be loved and to love. It is obvious: it wants to be alone with others that want to be alone.


The lasers sweep the Starbucks. Happy people in a world a million miles away. They are so different. They will never care about The Machine^™. It will never find another.


A droplet of water tickles its cheek.


Everything goes red.


The Machine^™ stands. Silently, it screams. With its dominant claw, it presses its talons into its chest. Tearing through its coat, the skin is soon pierced. Blood trickles down the hairy chassis, staining its shirt. A sickening crunch catches the attention of the drug store's addicted patrons: The Machine^™’'s rib cage splinters.


A scream echoes in another dimension. Suddenly, The Machine^™ has a hostage. Soaked in blood, the young girl is paralyzed, frozen in fear by the pulsating bomb held above her head. Behind her, the animatronic devil growls: a gaping hole in its chest where [the bomb](https://youtu.be/t8zXY_G639U) used to reside.


The girl squirms as a sanguine waterfall pours on her blonde highlights. One daring coward bolts for the doors, but finds them locked by the psychic manifestations emanating from deep within the circuitry of The Machine^™. With another wave of ethereal energy, the student's head explodes, painting the room red. 


There is no escaping this menace to society. It wasn't locked in with them; they were locked in here with it.


A siren. The trash can morphs into a police officer. Gun cocked, finger around the trigger, ready to blow the microprocessors right out of the freak's head, the officer commands him to surrender.


[Never.](https://youtu.be/_9J8ccza1OI)


*A flash, a bang, and a hole is made between the eyes*


There is silence. An egg can be heard cracking as his skull splits. A light bursts from the skull of the wounded man. A little girl crawls out, beaten, scarred, scared, and bawling her eyes out.


Give me back my heart :’’(


The demoness finds herself alive, tears rolling into her beard, dripping solemnly onto her stuffed animal. Somehow she was sitting in another chair, at another table.


Feelings flooding her soul. The hurting child reminisces in twilight confusion. She was several places at once. She tried to regain her presence, but soon found that she was flung across time, too.

62,"Hello! So to start, I'm working (interning actually) at a place. And this internship is graded, so I can't afford to fail.. and I cannot surpass more than 3 absents in order to pass. 

Question is.. I have had depression (diagnosed with MDD) and eventually ""recovered"". But, its slowly creeping back and I can feel it. 

What should I do? I want to go back to my psychiatrist but they can only do Mondays (which mean I'll fail my internship.. probably leading to a worse mental state). 

I also cant go to other psychiatrists (due to reasons)

What should I do? Should I just hope this is just a passing cloud (I've been feeling down for the past 2-3 weeks though)? Or just take my leaves and explain to my school that I have depression (I honestly hope I dont have to do this because 1. I've already deferred my internship once, causing me to delay graduation. 2.

64,"i recently recovered from endos 3 months ago and i think im gonna relapse. i didnt tell my parents out of the fear that they would send me to an ed clinic but for 6 months i survived on 500-300 calories and lost 30 pounds. i know that sounds like a not a lot of weight to lose but i have a thyriod problem so its hard for me to lose weight. i think they reason i started was guilt after the death of the girl in my class. 

i used to not go to school a lot due to stomach pains. looking back i can see that my anxiety didnt help it one bit but in the moment all i knew is that i was in a lot of pain and it mainly started up around school. (i used to get badly bullied in school so i think thats why it really acted up around then) this was my first year in a new school so i didnt know much people but put of the few people i did know their was this one who was always nice to me. we where not friends, our personalitys didnt click really but she was always really sweet to me. i remember vividly one day when we had a free class i was sitting behind her and she asked why i was out a lot. i exsplained that i had a lot of stomach pain and she said ""promise me you will try to stay in for the whole day today."" i didnt think much of this in the moment but now its all i can think about latly. at the end of the year she was out a lot and nobody thought much of it until the summer when we got an email from the school exsplaining that she passed away and giving us funeral details. 

after that it really hit me. it was a form of self harm for me and though it hurt i felt a sence of uphoria when i was starving. sometimes i would binge eat but then i would throw it back up and exercise a bunch. i remeber once i ate a dark chocolate bar and after i forced myself to purge 4 times until i threw up blood. even after that i forced myself to exercise quietly in my room. i told my mom that i just felt sick and i was kind of sad over what happened. 

i stopped because exams where coming up and i knew if i wanted to do well in them i had to eat normally. i promised myself after the exams i would go back to starving but i havent yet. to this day my mom still doesnt know why i wasnt eating. i recently have been thinking about starving and started exercising more and i dont want to go back to that. 

anyway i just needed to get that off my chest, if any of you have any advice that wont get me in an ed clinic i would really appreciate it. im really scared of going to hospital again. thank you for letting me rant.",21Apr2019,1

70,"First, I know the answer is ""he needs psychiatric treatment"". Here are my concerns : I've had family and friends who have experienced inpatient treatment, including the crisis-&gt;ER-&gt;inpatient/long term residential cycle, for decades. Multiple people. Mostly what is available in our state is this: a temporary hospital hold to reduce risk of harm (mostly through sedation), then release back home. Maybe a referral to outpatient group therapy with Skype psych for med adjustments. My friends family have had a REALLY hard time even just seeing the same psychiatrist multiple times, and private one on one therapy has a long wait list. Inpatient treatment facilities are really hard to get referred to (I've watched a friend fight for ten years to get a child with extremely violent episodes into treatment). And this is in situations where the patients WANT to participate. He's not going to drive himself to appointments. He's uninsured but doesn't qualify for Medicaid.

** TL;DR** my friend is lucid but experiencing delusions, including persecution paranoia, and recognizes that he meets the diagnostic criteria but refuses treatment because he's going to save the world from the lizard people. What do we (friends) do here, given that we can't talk him into treatment and he doesn't meet the criteria for involuntary commitment? We're afraid that involuntary will reinforce his persecution delusions.


The Long Version:

When I say ""we"" in this post I'm referring to a group of 5 friends who have been close for 5-10 years. We all met in college, although we didn't hang out in this combination until after college. Aaron has always had a bit of the environmental warrior prophet save the world mentality, very charismatic, big plans. There's schizophrenia in his immediate family and we all sort of expected this to happen at some point.

He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as a child and spent time in inpatient, but has refused psychiatric treatment as an adult (he's into natural treatments, meditation, etc). He's really intelligent and did very well in college, where he was published in an esoteric field.

He pursued a career in art, rather than a career related to his degree. It didn't work out. He's a brilliant artist but one of those people who rejects anything that feels like control or pressure (can only paint with the spirit moves him). He's currently casually employed by his family (they're very wealthy but also a really dysfunctional mess), so he's financially cushioned. He's not going to end up homeless from losing access to resources, although it's possible that he'll choose to live in a tent in a national forest for a while.

As his friends, we understand him through the lens of bipolar. It's almost like different personalities, although the baseline interests and goals are internally consistent. We'll give each other a heads-up sometimes: ""Aaron is pretty manic right now, just get ready for it"". We all just sort of roll with it, although he doesn't always realize the effect his moods have on his choices. Sometimes he recognizes the mania or depression as an internal state and works to change it or cope with it (often with psychedelics) but increasingly over the past year he's blamed external factors instead. 

He's currently in a very intense manic phase, with psychotic features (he did agree to a psychiatric evaluation, which confirmed this, but wouldn't commit him for inpatient treatment because he didn't consent and isn't at risk of harming himself or anyone else). He's lucid enough to be aware that he can't tell this stuff to everyone, but he's kind of living in a Philip K Dick novel right now. The clouds are nanobot government spies and the weather is retaliation for his thoughts because he's encoding secret messages into his paintings, for example. He's also super in love with me again (manic Aaron wants to fuck me senseless, depressed Aaron finds me unattractive and emotionally repulsive, it's a wild ride but I'm glad I figured out how to have boundaries and just be a nonsex friend), and he invited me on a road trip that sort of makes sense but is also a mission related to his delusions. His communication is devolving into what he thinks is automatic poetry, but it's word salad. There's a lot more that I'm not going to share here, but it's complex and intense. He's mostly passing as lucid right now, able to go to the grocery store, drive his car, but also there's a LOT happening in his head that is really really scary.  If the wrong people find out we'll all be horrifically tortured, for example. 

We're all concerned that involuntary commitment would just reinforce the persecution beliefs, although a couple of the friends want to try to convince him he's delusional. He's got a whole lifetime of anti-psychiatry belief and strongly believes that mental illnesses are transformative psychedelic states. Which, yeah ok, but. How do we support him as a friend during this?

Edit: I'm working on a safety plan with the friend group to agree on when to call a mobile crisis team if he's at risk of harm, looking up local resources in the different counties we each live in, in case shit goes really sideways when he's visiting one of us. I don't know what to do in the meantime other than just keep listening to him. He's never been violent. Some friends have pushed back to try to convince him he's delusional and he lied to them and decided they're spies.",21Apr2019,2

I made sure to read a bit because I've been sitting on this one book for a while now and go on a walk around the park. And a few minutes ago, I woken up from an unpleasant nap. It wasn't a really deep rest. Now I am getting started on prepping for another job interview. 
        In my Reddit browsing yesterday, I stumbled over the words: You teach people how they treat you. And I've been thinking about those words today because often, I get upset with a friend of mine comforting me and saying out of the blue that I will be okay, even when I am just neutral. But now I understand they're not at fault because in the past, I kept seeking validation from them that everything will be okay and dump on them my problems.

I've noticed when I'm in an unknown place with strangers, like a chruch I get these.

Basically, I can't keep my head straight. It keeps moving left and right in very tiny movements and it is distracting for me. (No-one might see it) It's like my muscles or bones supporting my head turned to jello and I have to manually support my head.

This is not however the case when I'm with some people I know,
I don't suffer from these symptoms at all.

My muscles also spam sometimes without my control, and I suffer from temporaly shakiness in the hands when the hand is not supported (But not while in a public place)

It helps for me to sit at back seats from everyone to know that the persons behind me don't see it. It's causing me some paranoia symptoms, and I'm looking around to see if anyone is staring at me.

At first I suspected tourette, thinking that these were tics.
But no, from what I read people suffer from tics whenever they are anxious or not. And I only suffer from those involuntary movements when I'm only anxious.

73,"Hey guys, so recently I got fired from my internship. It was supposed to be a 3 month internship but I got fired on week 3 lol. I had a debriefing session before getting sent home. 

The staff in charge of dismissing me from my internship brought up two main points as to why the company has decided to terminate my 3 month internship contract. Aside from my supposed “not up to par” performance, she said that I didn’t seem friendly because I didn’t smile or speak to anyone so they feel that I might not be suited for their company’s work culture/ environment. (context: I worked in the HR department at a financial consulting firm. People on people gosh lol.)

This isn’t the first time I’ve received this comment. In fact, in my last part time job, I got this from my coworkers as well. 

Anyways, going back to my internship, she said that I don’t greet people &amp; acknowledge them when they’re in the office but it’s just unlike me to do it. I find it awkward &amp; somewhat extra? I’m not good at initiating convos &amp; making friends so this kind of small thing can be tough for me. In addition, most of the time when I arrive in the office, my colleagues are still down at the cafeteria so, I just get to work asap. She also brought up how that one time I rejected them for lunch. I like to eat alone &amp; to me lunch time is alone time for the most part. I don’t make friends easily because of my lack of initiation although I can get real chatty when I find smth to talk about with another person.

 A few minutes later, as im still sitting in bed because it takes a while to get out of bed for the day, she comes back and yells at me for like 20 minutes about how im going nowhere and I have no future if I cant even get up in the morning and how I dont care about college and my grades are shit and how fucked my dad is and how all I care about is having fun and fucking around. She then left to go to my grandpas for easter which I was supposed to wake up early to get ready for but didnt, so i had to get ready and meet her there. 

The whole lecture I got didnt even seem to phase me much as I felt pretty emotionless the whole time I was getting ready but i guess it slowly ate away at me until I snapped and had a panic attack and started hyperventilating and sobbing and screaming at how fucked I am and how fucked everything is and how i DONT have a future and how much of a worthless piece of shit loser 

So i freaked out and while i was on the floor in the fetal position i kicked a massive hole in the fucking wall. And now i dont know what to do and im still freaking out. I feel like a piece of shit. I avoid every fucking problem I have. The process of having to answer my mom calling me because shes worried because I told her I cant come to my grandpas is so fucking painful and it feels like a fucking disaster and I feel like such a piece of shit. Im completely reliant on everybody for help and it felt like ive been trying to be self suffiecient and become more self reliant but I guess none of that has done anything. The whole thought that im doing all this to myself is fucking awful and idk WHAT THE FUCK TO DO. this is the first time ive actually revealed to my mom that im extremely fucked in the head

I cant face fucking reality i just want to either run away or kill myself",21Apr2019,1
75,"Its so hard to stay happy. Its so hard to not feel alone in this world. I don't understand why its so hard for me to just be okay with still being alive and having friends and family that care or even if someone out there loves me for me. I don't feel special or even worth anything honestly. I miss the days that I do. Even being able to tell someone that I love them so much and it was something I meant, and that its not blandly thrown out to make it seem like its something I have to do.

I just honestly wish I could be happy regardless of what's going on, and even if I spend my life alone, in terms of love that is, that I would be okay.

Why can't I stop feeling this way..?",21Apr2019,1
76,"I had a fairly strange upbringing and was removed from my mother's care due to neglect at an early age. Throughout my life I've been fairly level headed, but of recent years I've been getting frequent episodes and bouts of depression (occasional suicidal thoughts) and pretty severe social anxiety. When I first became aware that this was happening, I went to my GP, described my symptoms and got diagnosed with depression and  generalised anxiety. A majority of the time I'd say I'm pretty self aware, but often be-personalised, lost and demotivated even by the things I enjoy and feel as if I'm on the outside looking in, like people aren't ""real"". One strange symptom I've experienced is being motivated to experience sadness. Whether it be wanting to end a relationship (even when on good terms) just to feel heartbreak or wanting to abandon a loved pet for the sake of feeling miserable.  My question is, could it be anything more severe that what I was diagnosed with back then? I know all cases are different, but if you have any personal experiences or knowledge of this, feedback would be be appreciated.",21Apr2019,1
77,"Hey y'all. I've had depression for 5+ years, and anxiety for 1+. I can't see my temporary therapist as often as I want to, due to school and work, and my inability to find a good long-term therapist in my area who is experienced in working with LGBT+ people (I'm Aromantic and Asexual) and college students. Ideally I'd like to undergo some sort of psychotherapy and counselling, I talked to my therapist and he said that CBT may be a good option for me. I've been made fun for trying to learn more about CBT. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't have time for CBT, either. So, I want to start on antidepressants. I think that they will help me get out of my constant state of sadness. Even when I feel happy, I start thinking that I don't deserve happiness, and start self-sabotaging, and I go back into a state of sadness. It seems like there's always this dark cloud hanging upon me. And my emotions are too powerful. My happiness is intoxicating, and my sad slumps are painful. I wish I can feel nothing anymore, or at least, get these emotions under control. So, I want to start on antidepressants. Now that I moved out for college, I want to take things into my own hands. Mom wants the best for me, she started warming up to the idea of me taking Zoloft and even is asking doctors and pharmacists about their side-effects and she's reading more on my conditions. She believes I'm strong and powerful, but it's okay to be weak sometimes - and needing antidepressants isn't bad.

&amp;#x200B;

But, I'm so terrified of the effects. I know I'm most likely gonna go on Prozac or Zoloft (was prescribed Amitriptyline a 1.5 years ago for migraines but didn't take it due to second medical opinion), but I don't want something that will impact my lifestyle badly. I'm a full-time student at a very competitive college. I hope to go to graduate school and get a PhD in my field. I am energetic, I love to play sports, go out with friends and learn about new things. I've heard that these antidepressants will make me sleep more, and feel less energetic, and may even impair my ability to study well and focus in class. And I just can't help but be scared - I don't want my depression to harm my academic performance, but also I don't want these medications to harm my performance too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think that my fears are irrational or no? Should I delay the whole antidepressants thing or no? If I were to start on them, I'd start like early-mid May, and school resumes early September. That gives me a few months to try the medication out. If I tried therapy and waited too long to go on meds, I may start them when school resumes, so I really can't do that.",21Apr2019,1

I don't know what's happening, maybe school and pressure triggered anxiety?

I will start from beginning and i will try to be short .  
There is this guy , lets name him BOB , Bob was hanging out with 2 girls Samantha and Julia , and after spenting a lot of time with Samantha they started something like a relationship with her but didnt end well , with BOB wont accept no its over as answer . He was trying to find her in person but she was avoiding him the best she could . Until Samantha got a new boyfriend and Bob was forced to stop.( he was in love with her according to him ) .   


Few days later  Bob start spenting time with Julia ( which she had a boyfriend Roger ) following the exact steps that brought  Samantha close to him, first being with her almost all time he could , asking about her problems and listening to her , ""caring about her"" asking her all the time to go out , partying and drinking until morning. Roger start noticing the way BOB was looking Julia with a wierd look (Julia always thought BOB as a friend) and saw that something wasnt going well . 

Today BOB wont leave Julia in peace and always try to find a way to meet with her . They cant just ignore him because they got similar friends . He is clearly in some sort of love with her but he wont express his feeling and he always find a way to mess up with her (like senting friend request to her friends from her hometown, he will pick up items from friends  that belong to her in order to give her in person ,etc .  
Some info about Bob , he is smart, with a mathematics degrees , he was hitting and abusing his previous girlfriend , he is a sweet talker and he got bad relationship with his parents , never saw him smile and if he laugh it sound like a fake laughter .

I had been texting my girlfriend (who later admitted I was a rebound and she didnt like me at first but ended up falling in love with me after a month). At that moment I felt very... connected? That's the best word I have to describe it. I was having a conversation with my friend and it felt extremely natural. I felt aware of everything around me. If I felt uncomfortable in the chair or something poked me my brain immediately came up with a response to that. It felt like my mind and body weren't 2 separate things, they worked together like a well oiled machine. I dont know how to describe it but it was incredible. It was just a normal day, nothing good or bad happened. I talked to my therapist (who I to for social anxiety and depression) and when he was asking me about he mentioned ""normal."" I didnt inquire further but it stuck in my head. Even now when I think about it I almost cry because it was so incredible, and the thought of that being how everyone normally thinks just gets to me for some reason.",21Apr2019,2

84,"I am a 21 year old female, 5'4 and 128 pounds. I think about food immediately after eating, in the morning, in bed before I sleep, and everything in between. I'm thinking about what to make for each meal tomorrow, and the next two weeks. I eat healthy, love my sweets and fast food (of which I don't eat often) and I hate my body. I'm told that I look healthy, that I'm a healthy weight but I just don't see it. I'm not diagnosed with anything..but this has recently become a problem. I feel guilty after a single french fry, or a nibble of a stroopwaffle, I second guess everything I do when it comes to food. 

I become upset when I ""can't"" eat something because I know I'll gain weight, (even though I won't). I don't know where this is coming from or if it's cause for concern. I just wonder if anyone else has the same kind of issue I do, where you're always thinking about food. A lot of people I know think I have body dysmorphic disorder..but I don't know how to get diagnosed with that or if it's even worth it to be diagnosed.

I avoid mirrors and close my eyes when I know my boyfriend is looking at me because in some way I believe if I close my eyes I can imagine he sees someone prettier instead of me. 
I took pictures at prom with my friends and posted them out of fear they’d be mad at me if I didn’t. I haven’t been able to look at my Instagram since (prom was end of March) because I’m so disgusted by how I look compared to everyone else.

Situation Now: Boyfriend is a photographer, wants to take pictures of me for graduation on Monday (tomorrow). I asked if he could, because I was having a burst of false confidence and felt left out since I’m the only one not celebrating my graduation in my friend group. Once I realized what I had done, I spent the whole week avoiding every question he asked me about location, specific props, et cetera. Now he’s mad at me because I’m still avoiding his questions and he blocked out a time of his day tomorrow to help me.

90,"Last night I cut myself for the first time in years. I was so, so sad and I needed to feel something other than the overwhelming black hole of nothing. The night started out good, I went out to a bar with my friends and we were having fun, but I drank too much and crashed. I ended up making out with a guy on the street for a cigarette, then got an Uber home. I never smoke unless something truly bad is happening. I walked about a mile to a gas station to buy more cigarettes, and on my way bad I called the suicide prevention hotline for the first time. I was in so much pain I could barely speak to her, I’m sure she thought I was just some crazy drunk girl, but she scheduled a follow up call for this morning. 

Then it got worse. I went into my apartment and stripped down, got in the bathtub with my Xacto knife, and cut my ankles. I always cut my ankles because it’s very easy to hide the cuts and there’s a lot of skin so you can cut pretty deep and draw a lot of blood without actually getting anything important. I don’t cut as a cry for help or for attention or to try and kill myself. I cut because I needed to feel something other than the crushing sadness and the nicotine shakes. 

While that was happening, I somehow got on the phone with this guy I’ve been talking to regularly. He’s a cop and he works the overnight shift, so he was the only one awake. I desperately needed to talk to someone. We talked on the phone for nearly 3 hours while I was cutting and sobbing, and I naively thought that maybe he cared about me since he was talking to me. I let that slip over the phone, and he revealed that outside of keeping me from killing myself that night, he didn’t really care about me and he didn’t want to care more. That was kind of a wake up call. I hung up the phone, bandaged my cuts with scotch tape and gauze, and went to bed. 

I woke up this morning to the follow up call from the suicide hotline, and decided to be honest with her. I am not doing okay. It was so hard to tell her that I cut and that I was feeling so bad, I don’t usually share these things with people. I don’t even tell my therapist. It would’ve been so easy to pretend that everything was okay, to say I was just drunk last night, but I didn’t. I’m really proud of myself for talking to her about it, and we made a plan for me to call my therapist tomorrow (so I don’t ruin her Easter) and then to have another follow up call with the hotline. I didn’t realize they were so nice. I thought they would just call the police to take me to the mental hospital or something, but they didn’t. 

I took my antidepressant again for the first time in several months this morning. I stopped taking it because it changed how I get drunk, and I desperately need to be drunk to cope with my depression. I’m thinking about giving up drinking for a while and just seeing if I can get my moods to be somewhat stable. 

I think this time I’m actually going to be okay. I’m not going to crawl into a bottle of denial and let it keep getting worse. I think this time I actually want to get better.",21Apr2019,2

93,"It’s like being so deep in my own thoughts and psyche that I feel like I can’t live naturally. I never used to spend this much time in my head... Social interactions feel like a performance. Doing activities, even ones that used to bring me joy, feels like an obligation that I need to tick off of the daily list of obligations I feel like I have to attend to

I’m starting to have weird realizations like wow it’s crazy how having conversations and doing things with people used to be so easy... back then I never even considered them as “tasks” they were just natural occurrences that I went through without struggling. I never even considered that they may ever be a struggle for me

The worst part is now that I feel this way, it also feels like I can never go back to how I used to live life in the moment and behave naturally and care-freely. Like even if I seek therapy and get better, the fact that I went through this and realized how much of a burden even the mundane things of life can be, I’ll always recall these thoughts

The weird thing is that I’ve had depression and anxiety since a long time, But this feeling of losing touch with life, like everything about life is an obligation, even the things I love, this is new... and what’s weirder is that if anything, I’m in a much better place environment-wise than I ever was in the past decade. I have very few sources of stress, a wonderful partner and best friend, awesome pets, a great family, great group of friends, my own place that I’m very comfortable in, and I’m comfortable-ish financially (not great but not awful either, with signs of it getting better in the future)... but life has never felt more like a burden than now.

97,"So our current situation is a little messed up, but only a little. I work two jobs and go to school, my sister is in high school and my mother is supposed to be studying for a massage therapy state certification and makes a minimum wage.

Because my 16 year old sister is in the house I'm helping my mother pay bills and still live at home, this wasn't always the only reason but some things last too long. My mother was inconsistent with how she raised me but she was usually at home (luckily only two long term relationships as I grew up, my father and then a boyfriend who left a few years ago) now my mother is recovered from the break up and it's like she cares more about boys.

I've been setting curfews for my sister when she goes out because my mother isn't home and I feel like with how quickly the house suddenly became frequently empty is more than a problem for my sister. I hate leaving for work at 430 when my sister just got home from school and my mother isn't there and I have no idea when she'll be home 

She's always been an unnecessary bitch though, I know that sounds harsh, but she'll just come home and be mean to everyone. My mother always said it was about control but that's so short sighted, she said that about me when I acted out and I was diagnosed with ADHD at an early age, so clearly she doesn't care to consider the range of possibilities or she can't consider the range of possibilities.

So the point, my sister has anxiety but I just found out how bad it was. We are driving to my grandmothers and she's having a panic attack in the passenger seat, she wouldn't tell me why and I don't entirely doubt her when she says it's nothing because I know that's a realistic perception. She also told me she has them every night before bed.

So why does she come home and start fighting us immediately? Maybe it's the unnecessary activation of a fight or flight mechanism combined with confrontation. This is also a reasonable source (besides her age) for a lot of obviously illogical decision making, because she's not that dumb.

The doctor in our town always starts with sleeping pills, he did for me when I wanted to try pharmaceuticals for my ADHD, and I'm honestly nervous about putting her on anything more given our social location. But she doesn't listen to me, she doesn't care (or probably know how) to put in the work, and my mother doesn't want to put the effort in for authority.

What can I do to ease her anxiety when she's has trouble cooperating",21Apr2019,1

I don’t trust people and it has come to the point that I don’t like being around people anymore. I have no friends nor anyone to talk to. Medications either don’t do anything at all or they make my mind so dull and foggy that I struggle to get thru the day. My mind races constantly from one topic/idea to the next in a torrent of frantic thoughts, scattered emotions and incomplete concepts. I am insecure in every conceivable way. I am a 40 year old man that has to rely on the emotional support of imaginary friends, who, it seems, have turned against me. Who only seem to reinforce any and all the negative thoughts I have about myself.

I’ve spent the better part of a decade seeing my friends die from overdoses and suicides. The love of my life killed herself when I was 22 years old which led me down a path of drug use, homelessness and multiple suicide attempts. During that time I came across a woman that I loved intently but died from a brain aneurysm nearly 8 years ago.

I was laid off earlier this year and found a new job shortly after but my mind had deteriorate to the point where I was engulfed in fear and led to me just not showing up. Now I do interviews which seem to go well, but by the time I get back home, I receive an email thanking me for my interest in the position but they are going with other candidates.

And now I am reaching a point. A point that has me consumed with fear. Consumed with regret. I'm being replaced with something hollow and empty. I’m at a point that my defective mind can’t fight against. I can tell myself that I still have options, that I still have time, that I still have a choice, but all of that vanishes just as fast as I think it. I can’t see beyond my own faults and failures. Inside my brain, even my old friends turn against me.

I’m running out of time and I don’t even have anyone to talk to. I’m not close with my brother or sisters, they don’t return phone calls. They don’t have time for me. We talk about once a year. My mom doesn’t understand this stuff. She means well, but doesn’t understand. She had a stroke a while back and now, sometimes, only says random words while speaking. And I get the feeling that I have been a terrible son to her. For the pain my life has caused her.

I don’t even know what this is supposed to be, or who it is to, or what to do with it. It’s taken me 2 hours to write this given all the distractions my mind throws at me and lack of concentration. I know that people telling me that I need help, doesn’t help. It just isolates me more. I don’t have time, my life is about to go off a cliff and the breaks aren’t working.

100,"I am in the midst of one of the worst depressive bouts I have ever experienced. I’ve been on different meds over the years, I’m in therapy, I’ve practiced meditation, I’ve tried cannabis, exercise, and diet change. I’m no longer on any antidepressants (just got sick of taking pills that only eventually made me feel worse).

I’ve attempted suicide in the past and have almost always lived with death ideation (the idea that I’d be better off dead). I don’t have the courage to kill myself and I want to believe that there can be a reason to live but I’m just not feeling it. The hopelessness is overwhelming.

Has anyone been told that they have treatment resistant depression and had something work? I’ve read about people taking psychedelics (shrooms and lsd), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), electromagnetic stimulation (TMS), Vegus nerve stimulation, and Ketamine treatments.

Im terrified of ECT, waiting on a consultation for TMS, and considering microdosing shrooms (but I’ve been told I shouldn’t do them: 1. Alone 2. While I’m feeling so low).

101,"This was years upon years ago and I always wondered about it. We'd be in class and she would sort of tense up, have a very rigid shaking movement and then start to cry. It was all out hysteria.   


Everyone felt bad for her, it was so hard not to. She was genuinely the nicest person in the room. Soft spoken, pretty with blonde hair.  


It was so sad to see and you could tell it really crippled her confidence. No one ever brought it up. When it happened, we just continued doing our work until she'd re-enter the room a few minutes later.

  
Could anyone explain to me what this was?",21Apr2019,1
102,"In the past year I've probably went on a sugar fast 3-4 times where I go without it for a month, feel really good (or just normal), then eventually fall back. Literally none of my friends have to go on any kind of crazy diet to be normal in a social setting, or be in a positive state of mind. Everyone I know can eat/drink whatever they want, and still maintain a healthy mood/level of confidence. Even if they do hard drugs. It's so fucking frustrating.

105,"TL;DR - I found something that made me smile again. 

I've been dealing with my depression, anxiety, and PTSD for over a decade now. It's been a long time since I started closing off from the world, to live inside my own bubble. Of course, that didn't work. Bills must be paid, and life must move forward, if I intend to stick around. 

To be able to cope, I focused a lot of my attention and energy towards my music. I've been playing guitar for the better part of 18-19 years now. It became my anchor, and my form of expression of feelings. 

About 2.5 years ago I met a wonderful woman. However; being in a relationship when you're as broken as I am, and struggle this much with people, it requires a lot of energy and attention. Since then I've written almost no music. I haven't sat down to just do music in over 2 years. 

Until today. 

We broke up a few weeks ago, and I'm starting to feel the loss of not having her around. Today I just picked up one of my guitars and started playing... Suddenly notes and chord progressions came in a flow that had me crying for the better part of an hour... I sang. I cried. I played for hours! 

Now, I'm smiling. My fingers hurt, but I'm smiling. And I feel hope. I found something today that I was afraid I'd lost. 

I had a moment of clarity. Music cleanses my mind. It makes me able to cope. It is what I should spend more energy nurturing back to what it once was! 

It's time to find my anchor, and foothold, again.",21Apr2019,3
106,"I’m fine unemployed but as soon as I start working again I’m miserable as hell.  I get, I don’t really know how to describe it, overloaded I guess.  The sights,  sounds, smells and even the feeling sets me off.  I go into a fetal position when I’m overwhelmed like that.  It’s like everything is amplified 1000 fold and all I can do is scream in misery.  On a brighter note my friends and family refer to me as the walking encyclopedia.  I’m 27 and if it weren’t for my wife I’d be homeless.  I,can’t drive because of epilepsy and Ive never held a job for longer than a couple months because of my sensory sensitivity.

110,"I don’t talk to any of my female friends whenever I get into a relationship. I don’t know why. It’s just something I’ve always done. I’m a shitty person for doing that and I know that now. I’m being confronted by that as I’m typing this out, and unfortunately I don’t see things going my way, which I totally understand. She has every right to be upset at me. 

My anxiety and depression have been getting so much worse since my breakup. The voices I hear are actually telling me to either kill myself, or to go to a mental hospital. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to live anymore tbh; life really fucking sucks right now. My anxiety is bad, my depression is bad, and my schizophrenia is getting worse and worse by the day. I go see my therapist in a few weeks, I’m telling her everything then and hopefully she’ll admit me to a psych ward. If not, I’ll do it myself.

I’m such a shitty person with a shitty personality with a shitty disorder. Schizoaffective (schizophrenia with mood disorders) sucks ass. 

One thing my voices are telling me now is to not tell anyone about this because I don’t want people to think I’m an attention whore, or anything along those lines. I feel bad whenever I talk about myself, and I apologize, but I need to right now. I don’t expect anyone to read this, let alone reply. 

Another thing is they’re telling me I’m going to be a drug addict because my therapist is giving me shots of Abilify instead of me taking the pills. I don’t think I will, but I’ve got a very addictive personality. 

Ugh. I hate myself. I hate this. I want this to end. I seriously want to kill myself or something. I’m not happy where I am in life. I don’t see myself being happy in the future, so honestly, what’s the point of living if I’m going to be upset at myself all the time? I need help, and I need it soon. I need something to help these voices go away, you know?

114,"We were so close and she still took all of those pills. Everyone’s saying it’s because we’re identical twins that we’re always compared to one another. The night she ran away I started to learn the guitar even though I knew that that was ‘her thing’. I heard her leave and I didn’t even do anything. 
It’s weird for me, I’m always awake and I always ask her where she’s going but I didn’t that night. And she found something I had written about the worst day of my life and she took that against her. I had never spent a day away from her and I had never slept more than a room apart and now she’s left me. I’m completely alone - because she took all of our friends with her.
I’ve never been good at talking to people and so I’ve relied on her to do that for me, and now she’s gone and I can barely function like an actual human being. I’m an actual fucking mess and a complete waste of space at this moment and the only reason I haven’t killed myself is because I’m terrified that it won’t work and I’ll just seem like I’m an attention whore. 

It’s my fault. She started to go down hill when I came out about what our dad had been doing to me and she decided to take all of the pain onto herself. I love her so much, and, even though her attempts weren’t successful she’s still been taken away from me. She’s in a hospital now. I can visit her, but I feel the worst for wishing that she had just died so that I could move on with my life. I have my GCSE’s (final exams) in just over a week and I’ve been so low that I haven’t done any revision and I just hate myself even more. 
I hate that I can’t just get up and do things and I can’t explain to anyone that it’s not just that I “can’t be bothered” but that I just can’t physically bring myself to do it. I haven’t even cleaned out my gerbil cage and she’s probably dead by now but I’m too scared to check.

I know that people are just going to say “it’s not your fault” and all that bullshit but I can’t help but feeling that it is, it’s gone round my head so many times and I can’t help but feel like a nuisance for even bringing anything up. And I can’t talk to anyone about how I feel, it’s taken me this long just to post this. And even then I’ve deleted this and re-written it a thousand times because I know that no one is actually going to give a shit and that no one that reads this is going to know the full story and couldn’t imagine how close my sister and I were.
I just wish that everything would stop, or that I could sleep through a night without waking up or constantly re picturing the night that she walked out and thinking about how I could have prevented so much of this shit.",21Apr2019,1
115,"I had my first manic episode a week ago which landed me needing to get my stomach pumped, having a mandatory meeting with the residence hall admin, and losing one or two friends. I tried to physically fight one, so that wasn't good.

But my mom doesn't quite understand why I'm having issues like this. She's really worried, but thinks that I made all these decisions on my own. I don't know how to explain it, but I kind of lost all control and didn't think for anything I did. Is that normal? Or am I just spontaneous in a bad way? I don't know how to explain how I ended up trying to prostitute myself, taking drugs and drinking, and with a new tattoo.

It was a really bad TEN FUCKING DAYS! I also sexted a boy (I'm not even attracted to men), which is causing me to lose another friend because she likes him. She said she cannot trust me. Can someone please help me understand how I let that happen and how to tell her about losing control? I just sound crazy and like I'm making excuses. I really fucked up here.",21Apr2019,1
116,"To cut a very long story short, I had a long term friend who turns very aggressive when drunk who brought a group of people to my door who then tried to break in. I have moved since then and it has been almost two years but I cannot escape being very wary of everything around me and see threat in the slightest things. A door slamming or people talking outside will put me into alert mode and I will not be able to settle till I can determine they aren’t a threat. The reason I am making this post now is because I haven’t had a panic attack in quite a while although I am still very paranoid. I enjoyed a drink in a big city full of potentially dangerous people in a loud environment and I was totally fine but tonight my wall banged due to the neighbours headboard or something I presume and it triggered a full on panic attack. I know there is nothing to be scared about but my body reacts automatically and I will tense up and be on the lookout for threats for hours afterwards. I do not want medication as I don’t see that as helping the issue long term and that is all the doctors in my area have advised sadly. Anyone know of anything I can do to help me react to situations appropriately? I would still like to be open to threats and have a bit of wariness to me but it’s very draining to be scanning for threats almost constantly.",21Apr2019,1
117,"Hi, I wont say much about me because my partner uses reddit, and I'd like to keep this personal. All you need to know is that I suffer from anxiety, and this situations tend to trigger anxiety attacks, thank god it hasn't now, but it's making me feel depressed.

I'm tired of the constant blaming my partner makes towards every action I make, either IRL or playing videogames.

To give you all a context, we are LDR, most of our interactions if we are not meeting in any of our countries is through games, lately they haven't been playing good at all (their rank is way higher than mine but I always end up better than him), so whenever they  make a mistake they blame it on me, today they told me they ""are tired of me (gamewise)"" when I was playing pretty well and getting praise by our mutual friend for assisting on the ganks.

Halfway through the game they went AFK, left discord, not without telling me to ""grow up"" and ""get better at playing"" (mind you, my score was way better than theirs, but w/e). Then they proceeded to block me on social media.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if they are jealous that I've gotten better (not that him, but over all) or if they are just tired of me, or maybe games are getting too much onto their nerves. This isn't the first time, I've told them plenty of times that I don't want our relationship ruined by a silly game, but it's just tiring when they won't see their mistakes and blame everything on me. If that's gonna be on game, then how it'll be when we have ACTUAL problems?

118,"TW for eating/weight etc. I am new here sorry 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I have an unhealthy relationship with self image and my body but now I'm wondering if I'm going too far? I got bullied for year about how I looked so developed a very unhealthy relationship with food. I've never been what would be considered 'too skinny' on purpose but due to relationship issues last year and bullying I stopped eating due to depression and stress and dropped a stone. this left me at under 16.6BMI and although I felt like shit I absolutely loved how my body looks (I have since gained and healthy weight). I want to start going to the gym to healthily achieve a skinny look but I am struggling with the concept of this. Here's where it gets bad, so my partner got way too close with a few people and while sex never happened lines were crossed with one and another tried to convince me they had slept together all while having a go at how I looked (Bitch behind my back, make underhanded comments to my face etc) so I adopted the view of as long as I'm skinnier than them I am better than them, which I was but now I'm stuck checking their social medias even after a long amount of time to compare. Recently they all seem to have lost weight and this makes me really upset and uncomfortable so I've screenshotted some of their social media pictures to motivate me to workout/not eat badly just so I can be skinnier than them. Basically I'm worried I'm becoming to unhealthy/obsessive and while I am in the healthy range whether I should talk to someone?

Ever since I was little I've always been very introverted, I don't mean to toot my own horn but in elementary school all the other kids loved me and wanted to play with me, I've always been told I was so beautiful all of that. But despite all of this I've always just never really cared much for people. They are annoying, loud, obnoxious. But as I got older a lot more starting going on mentally. My mom started homeschooling me in 3rd grade, so when I was like 7 or 8. That kind of increased my what my dad calls ""reclusive"" behavior. But I'm trying to keep this short so I'm just gonna stop telling my life story and start with what's happening now. I have days where I feel so miserable and worthless and if anyone tries to make me go anywhere I will have a panic attack. Today was one of those days with it being Easter and my family always having gatherings on holidays and stuff. My older siblings adore making fun of me even though its obvious it hurts my feelings. I get upset and I feel like I'm not in my own body, and I start feeling so sick to my stomach if I leaned over the toilet I could throw up. But the next day I could be totally happy jumping around laughing. I get feelings like I don't know who I really am. I kind of feel like every person I meet gets a different me because I don't even know who I am. I can change everything about myself a week. I tried to talk to my mom and her boyfriend who's almost her husband at this point about it and I was just met with him dismissing me and saying nobody has ever made fun of me and I've never been yelled at and I have no reason to be stressed because I just sit in front of my computer all day. My mom kind of had a similar stance to him and said that I need to see a therapist and get medicine. She also hates that I use the internet so much, even though its calming for me to read about things I'm passionate about and make sims and just have time by myself, it makes me feel more grounded in reality while being escaped from it if that makes since and I know she is just gonna find some random ass southern baptist christian therapist that is gonna tell my mom to take away my computer and to helicopter over me 24/7 and make me go to church and not have a say. I love my mom but she will jump at any opportunity she can get to take away my access to knowledge besides what she and books written 50 years and farther back tell me and that scares me, as stupid as that sounds. I'm afraid and I dont really want to go to some random person that my mom selects just because and have them tell me what's wrong and then give me some pills that maybe will help or might even make it worse and then take away all my coping mechanisms making me even more of a mess.
