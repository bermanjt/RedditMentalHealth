0,"It's been like this for months. I feel like there's all this pent up energy, all these thoughts and emotions, that I can't quite reach. I feel like I'm on the edge of insanity. I want to let go and dive deep, get it all out of my system or just stay there, but I can't. Like when you know you need to throw up and your body and you both want to but your mind says 'no! it'll hurt!'. I've tried therapy and meds to just slowly work through it but it just makes my depression worse. It feels like my brain is too strong to break but it needs to. And I can't feel the emotions that I need to feel for it because I'm so numb. Sometimes it slips through a bit, and I feel a bit better, but it's not enough. I want to feel, I want to hurt- but none of it is there. Just nothing, with this huge debilitating pressure weighing down on me, and i can't breathe. It's starting to feel like death is the way I can fix this and be free.",09Nov2019,1

I was recently shown affection, true, real, affection, and I can’t get enough. It hurts. It hurts to be away from them, they can’t be more with me because of my mental state but it doesn’t seem to be getting any better. I don’t know how to improve myself, how to put myself out there, how to have a conversation. I can’t do these simple things that will improve my life and state and I don’t know why.

2,"I’m 16 years old and for the past week or so I’ve been feeling angry or frustrated about something, I feel like I don’t get the same satisfaction out of stuff like I used to. I started bumping into people on purpose(guys only because I’m not a douchbag).I am a little cranky and a good friend of mine pointed that out to me as well so it’s not as if it’s in my head. It began a little more than a week ago and it made me even getting into a heated argument with somebody in the gym. I’m usually a down to earth type of person, I always try to find a middle ground or a reasonable solution to things like this but right now I feel like I want to either fight somebody/cry/scream or even just tell somebody what’s going on, but the thing is I don’t know why it’s happening. I don’t cry at all, even when my cat past away three months ago, I cried a little bit. I feel a little better when I’m chewing gum or clench my jaw but it doesn’t resolve it. Also, In that period (this past week) I feel like I’m falling in love with my two female best friends even though, inside I know I don’t. Bruh I feel like punching the air right or just hugging somebody I love. I know this is a long post but I hate this feeling and it affects my daily life as well so thank you.

3,My family is very cold and not very supportive. I’ve hid my depression for years and it’s gotten so bad that I don’t know what to do anymore.

4,"Throwaway account here.

So, recently, my friend (let's call him Dave) has been going through a lot of shit in his life. Dave has always been going through a lot of issues, but recently he's been taking it not so well. Over the past week or two, he's been having these intense breakdowns, but they don't feel... normal, if that makes sense.

Just today, Dave had a breakdown because his piece of shit father has basically shown he doesn't care about his well-being, just his grades. He vented about it in a private Discord channel, and it went pretty downhill. Normally, Dave complains about his father, and how poorly he treats him. However, Dave was exclaiming that his father is ""right"" and that he was just a ""bad kid"" and that's why he was treated so bad. 

Dave normally has moments where he rethinks his own actions and why he's being abused, but this was... different.

To me, it felt like his personality was different. He was upholding everything his father told him like it was the truth (when it clearly wasn't) and he got incredibly giggly, laughing about the whole thing before turning aggressive to me. Dave normally doesn't ever want to seclude himself from friends, but this time he tried to shut me out until I had to force myself to call him. From there, he kept saying that ""you don't know me,"" ""you're just a friend I know online,"" ""you've never seen the real me"" (stuff Dave's father has told him in the past about online friendships). He even said this to some other friends, but right after, he was bawling and apologizing, saying ""I didn't mean a single word I said.""

Dave told me that, during this episode, it all felt ""hazy"" and while he \*knew\* this breakdown happened, he couldn't exactly recall everything or why he did what he did.

I've speculated a lot on why he's been having breakdowns like these, but I want more of a definitive answer (he's had several episodes where he has acted totally different and not like himself, in multiple different ways, but I don't want to drag on recalling every instance). I assume it's some type of multiple personality disorder, but I don't want to diagnose something SO severe onto him.

Dave is getting therapy, thank god (even if his piece of shit father is barely approving of it), but I still feel quite left in the dark about this, and want to see if I can get a more definitive answer.

tl;dr My friend has had recent nervous breakdowns that have him act totally different from himself, having him act super delirious and uncharacteristically angry towards his friends, and once the episode is over my friend knows that it happened but can barely recall exactly what happened during them.",09Nov2019,1
5,"I’d like to first say that my only diagnoses are anxiety and depression at 12 y/o (terribly sorry I can’t provide the specifics, they’re escaping my mind- something like “general anxiety disorder” and “major depressive disorder” although I’m not sure those are the correct names). I take lithium, 600 mg. (I think) every night. am not diagnosed with OCD.

I’ve been having thoughts. I can’t tell anyone I know about them because they’re incredibly embarrassing but I need somewhere to vent/get help. With Joker having just come out I’m not sure anyone would believe me anyways, even though this started long before Joker was released. 

I have this idea, and it’s only in the moment, that my classmates can read my mind. I stop thinking whatever I am thinking, look around to read their expressions, either settle with “they’re good actors” or “they can’t read my mind” and try to think about something else. When a conversation gets awkward near me, I assume it is because they can hear what I am thinking and I ruined the conversation. I also feel that people are actors hired by my parents to measure my stability. Again, outside of the situation, I can recognize that it’s not true, but it’s so scary in the moment. I can’t trust my devices, I can’t trust people. I think about the world like it is a simulation at times, without acknowledging it. I will see something odd and think “how did the programmers let that slip?” Or something bad will happen and I’ll think “the programmers must be testing my resilience.” Again, I understand that this is not true after the fact. 

I have these thoughts that just pop into my head. Human feces, various sexual acts in extremely inappropriate situations (around children). These happen randomly and near constantly. I see in my minds eye people, including my family, touching me inappropriately whenever I am around them. I can’t control these thoughts. The ones near children make me feel like a horrible person. I have started to avoid children so I don’t think these thoughts. I have obsessed over the possibility that I am a pedophile. It is torture (14 y/o female, by the way. I would never touch or hurt a child. I just can’t stop obsessing over self hatred at the thought.)

I don’t have routines that keep me safe, which is why I doubt I have OCD. I don’t self diagnose. I need someone else’s opinion on this. I just want to function like a normal teenager. How do I make these thoughts stop?",09Nov2019,1
6,"Sometimes I have rage-fueled fantasies of taking out my anger on someone/taking revenge. I know this is not the answer to my problems,because I’ve tried that before,and after a brief moment of feeling like a badass and a manly man,it’s back to feeling like a piece of shit until the next time to “prove yourself” comes. Any productive ways to deal with anger?",09Nov2019,1
7,"I thought this would be a good place to vent but apparently not. Everyone keeps ignoring me. It’s clearly people trying to disrespect and hurt me and I’m gonna self harm. Bc everywhere I go, people act like insane and I don’t matter and what I say doesn’t matter bc I’m “crazy”. This subreddit consists of people who only want things for themselves and they don’t think about people who actually have problems like me. I wanna hang myself rn",09Nov2019,1
8,"Just so you know, I love my friend dearly, I wouldn't have agreed to move in with them otherwise. 

I'm just worried, we both have various mental health issues, theirs are more difficult and intense than mine, and I have been trying to sustain a positive mental attitude by blocking out bad vibes and practising self care and all that so that I'm not taken by the void again. They come to me often when they are having a hard time, and as someone who is quiet, introverted and most of the time doesn't know how to respond to people, it's incredibly taxing on my own mental health, especially when conversations can last for hours where I'm trying to convince them they are valued and nobody hates them and they're telling me they aren't convinced I actually like them. 

I don't mind them needing support every so often, but I feel like it's often enough that it drains my mental state and makes me start to feel lows that I'm actively trying to avoid. This is my first time leaving home, I'm not even 100% convinced I want to go yet (moving home is great for a number of reasons but it still makes me want to cry when I think about leaving my family and support system) and I'm worried that being around them 24/7 will severely drain me on a daily basis, because I don't want to end up as like their personal therapist having to try and reassure and motivate them when it's difficult just to do the same for myself. 

I don't want to mention it to them because I know how difficult their situation is and I worry that talking to them about it would make them worse as they have an intense fear of rejection. I just don't know what to do. I don't expect anyone here to one what to do or say either, but any thoughts are appreciated.",09Nov2019,1

10,"Not overdose and die, but I've been thinking about my options for suicide a lot lately. I took 800mg of Zoloft and 625mg of Strattera 2 1/2 hours ago and so far I feel no ill effects, not even stomach sickness, I'm not going to the ER, I'm 17, home alone without my phone, and don't want my problems out there. Anyways, like I said, I didn't take them to die I took that much because I wanted to know what it felt like at a lesser level, how bad it would be if I went through with it. I looked it up though and both of those drugs are hard to OD on. It's strange because when I took them I didn't know that, I wasn't sad or angry, it actually felt dutiful. The reason I decided to do this really comes down to bad social anxiety. Even as I type this I feel anxious because I feel like the way I felt and how I took the pills was weird. Overall I have very low self confidence about everything, voice, personality, hair, my entire being. What pushed me to do it this particular day though is that I formed a strong crush with this girl, I hate the feeling a lot, it's really painful for me because I feel a strong sense of wanting but in my head I'm not good enough, and everytime I think about it I think about my flaws, which is something I'm usually able to stop myself from doing. I was in counseling but it didn't really help much. My problem is that I have a problem getting my feelings and thoughts into words. I've lost a lot of my friends because I'm too anxious and also because I can never say anything because I think depression makes me not have anything to say. It was a lot worse a year ago, I cried all the time and felt a lot worse in general, but I've never been happy in life, a decade ago I told my teacher that I didn't want to live anymore. It's not even the pain I felt on this particular day, for me depression is attrition, it's taking my life away little by little by little and I was conscious through it and it's impact on my life and I grew tired of it. I always told myself (and still am) things will get better, but is it worth the wait? I feel like when I go out into the real world things will get better for me.",09Nov2019,1
11,"So recently someone admitted to me that they like me. However I do not feel the same way. They still text me telling me how they are sad about it. Or that they are sad about another girl. Which kind of hurts, just because they literally told me they had all these feelings for me, yet they complain to me about how they like this other girl who has a boyfriend. This person knows I've been in a really crappy mental state, yet they tell me all of this stuff that I can't do a thing about, which makes me feel worse. He also likes to bring up how I made him sad. It's like he is just trying to guilt trip me. I feel like he is a small psrt of why my mental health is declining more.

Is he in the wrong here or am I overreacting?

Found another girl I really liked and she said “I was the sweetest guy she ever met” but she didn’t want to be in a relationship. I have always been two things. A serious over thinker every single text I receive every word said to me I take it as a negative and worry myself sick and can’t sleep. I, also am insanely self conscious to try and fix that I took up going to the gym and a extremely strict diet which helps some days makes it worse others.

16,"For all of us who have lived **shitty** lives, but have only done **good** in their life, why would God do such a thing to us? We've done everything for everyone, yet have received nothing in return. The great and amazing deeds that we've done for the world amount to absolutely nothing, as we still get fucked in the ass by different obstacles.

That brings me to the question...if there is a God, why would he do this? Especially for those of us who will likely commit suicide in the very near future. Was there a point to it all?

If there is no God and no point to it all, then there are no consequences for the afterlife, right? When will the next mass-murder happen, in the thousands of people? A revolution, perhaps. Like Hitler.",09Nov2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

currently i feel more lonely then ever, i used to have no issues making friends online but now it has become exhausting. i dont even really want to type this all out, doing this itself feels exhausting and im forcing myself to do it. i need to do this but where do i even start? 

its a day later. i stopped writing and now i should be working. i drive uber now. im using that to try to make money so i can move out of this town. tonight is a good night but i cant even bring myself to go out and do it. why? i....dont know.

let me go back a long ways. i've always mostly kept to myself, and been awkward around people. i never really had much of a social life growing up, had maybe one or two friends here and there, but i never felt like i had friends for real. any time i saw some tv show emphasizing having good friends it almost always made me sad. i just stuck with my video games for the most part, and any acquaintances i made were also gamers. I was used to being picked on, exiled etc. high school comes around. got a girlfriend, that blew up in my face over something dumb, lost an early friend to it. started roleplaying on an anime message board i was introduced to by someone i played magic the gathering with at lunch and ended up finding a little nich rp group. met a girl online, went to see her, was a landwhale but i lost my V card to it. turned out she was crazy and we broke up. parents divorce, leaving me and my baby sister with my overprotective mother. found another girl that was in the same e-group that we kinda had been eyeing each other but we were both ""e-taken"". eighteen now, end up edating her for a while. around this time my mother had started going a bit crazy over me being online all the time with egirl among other things (she hated my video games and me being online so much that she refused to get internet at our new apartment so i had to go to the business center with my laptop to play). kept screaming at me to get out. egirl says she'd buy me a ticket to live with her. i take it. mother in tears begging me to go but i dont hear it.

&amp;#x200B;

move to live with egirl. cringe at first sight, but she grew on me. loved her personality (she was a 3/10 and thats being nice. she had arm flaps, js). things go good for a while, end up meeting some great people through her, have a great circle of friends. time of my life, living it up. things start to go south...slowly. she starts to go fridgid. we lose our spark because we arent rping anymore. she's a book nerd, im a gamer nerd. start playing second life again, play as a girl because why not? plus i kind of(really) had(have) a fetish for cute/loli so what better then to make my own? (i know this sounds off topic but this is actually important) start enjoying it. recognize a friend of mine so start playing with them on girl character. half way through i let them know who i am and i noticed things changed completely. decided to experiment a bit. eventually started hiding my identity as a male. out of nowhere girlfriend joins (she didnt want to play at first because she said it was over complicated). things turn around quickly, things are peaches and rainbows again. we dont have our in character selves be in a relationship because redundancy (mistake on my end i guess?). start noticing she's hanging out with her RP boyfriend (who knows we're married at this point because we've been together for over seven years now). find out she's planning on leaving me for him. confront her, she admits it. i try to win her back because im still in love. feels like she's doing things to mess with me on purpose but deflects saying she wants to still be friends. get a hunch and check chat logs. see her laughing with him about how she's messing with me and how she's over me already (even though she's still in bed next to me). long story short i toss her out. start going through depression but friends help me through it. go online hardcore, make lots of friends make guilds and have a huge online social life.......as a girl, voice changer and all. soon lose my job and cant find a job fast enough to pay for the apartment i was left with. so i had no choice but to move home with my mother (or live on the street) in the college town she lived in.

&amp;#x200B;

in that time i've worked a few jobs here, taken a few classes and tried to figure out what i've wanted from my life, my career. still havent figured that one out, i want to do something with video games but programing was soul rending to me and my artistic skills are nil. i found that i really like electronica music kind of have a good ear with it. i found that sound engineering was a field i could get into for video game design and said.....sure fuck it....thats what i'll do...i got nothing else going for me. so i've started working towards that, kind of. then again before that i said i'd teach, before that a franchisee, before that an xray tech. im sure i'll change my mind again.

&amp;#x200B;

i've made a couple of decent friends here....but unfortunately, it being a college town, they didnt stick around and i am still here spinning my wheels. as far as my online life goes, it was the only thing keeping me together since i got here. i continued to deceive people left and right online with my persona online and my voice changer. i never once catfished anyone though, any time i felt someone was getting the hots for me (which happened a LOT) i'd ""friendzone"" them quick by letting them know it'd never happen with anyone online. well unfortunately there was one that apparently had kept trying but i thought they were just a good friend. soon i got tired of acting and i just wanted to be myself among others, the act was getting old and some people were getting wise with things. that good friend was 'okay with it' and they disappeared, the friend of that friend decided to take it upon himself to follow me around to different friend groups i was in and call me a pedophile over and over again. and the kicker? not a single 'friend' did anything about it. they let it happen. i came to realize that the only reason i had any sort of online friends and anyone that was willing to extend genuine kindness to me was only because they thought i had a vagina. those that i did come clean with and still wanted to be my friend eventually would leave me. ie. i would ask them to hang out consistently and get turned down 90% of the time and never invited to anything unless it was for their own benefit. a couple of times i was invited was to come and play with the asshole calling me a pedophile. he didnt get removed until i did it myself. this same group contacted me again. they wanted me to join them on the game i met them in, archeage. i was happy to do so.....but due to reasons, i wasnt able to play on their server for a whole week. they leave me in the dust, not willing to do anything to help or even hang out with me, but hey i could hang out in their discord right? i left them eventually, after leaving a note explaining why. the 'lead' contacted me essentially begging me to come back, and also mentioning that he deleted my note. i reluctantly agreed........and never heard from them again. mentioned outer worlds and how its a good game a week later. got a 'cool' and nothing. still didnt get a re-invite or refriend. neat.

&amp;#x200B;

im rambling and i know i am, if you've gotten this far, thank you. i am seeing a therapist, im also smoking large amounts of.....both things. dont know how legal it is mentioning it on here but whatever. they did prescribe me some antidepressiants but they didnt work, made me nothing but angry all the time and snapping at everyone. in fact i wouldnt be surprised if they started downward spiral. well, i was already on a downward spiral, downwarder? few weeks after being on those antidepressiants, me and my mother had a shouting match and i needed to not be there anymore. i was planning on doing a campus visit (sound engeneering) in a day so i was just going to stay by my sister's place (she moved here a few years ago) because i just needed to get away and be with someone who cared. well, she told me that i couldnt. i told her that it was important. and she told me ""no because me and my boyfriend are going to have a threesome with some girl"". i literally did a u turn and drove straight to my campus visit without a single word to anyone (thankfully my cousin i was going to stay with was cool with it). ignored all calls and requested that my cousin didnt tell anyone where i was. of course that was the first thing she went and did behind my back! so when i got back, nobody gave a fuck i was gone. yes it was dramatic, yes it was dumb, and yes it proved that i cant trust a single fucking person.

&amp;#x200B;

i'm 33 now. i work for uber. i have no local friends. i have over 400 people on my steam friend list, but not a single one of them talks to me. i'll sometimes see them playing something and i might poke them to see if they got room for me. if i DO get a response it usually in the negative. or im told 'next game' and never contacted again. i honestly dont see the point in my continued efforts. I feel like right now im just living to live with no purpose in life. I get up and go throughout my day, but every day about a few hours in i just lose all will to......live. i hate to say it like that but its the truth. its not a situation that i want to go kill myself, im too much of a coward. i just end up laying in my bed with my inward thoughts for a while before i curl up and start crying. so here i sit, spinning my wheels. getting high and just trying to be numb to all the bullshit going on around me. i used to have my online social life to get me by, but i dont have that anymore......i wont lie...i did go back on second life as a girl again recently. it was so....so very easy to get accepted and it was fun, but i dont want to go down that path again...i lack any sort of motivation to do much of anything. i know what needs to be done sometimes, but i cant bring myself to do it, just like i SHOULD be at work right now, but right now im writing this. but maybe this is for the best? i doubt it. i feel like writing this is just another futile attempt. im so fucked up in the head right now that i want to be social and hang out with people but the moment im in that situation i want to run the fuck away.

&amp;#x200B;

thats it for now, i dont want to keep writing at the moment. im going through one of those shitty episodes right now of self loathing hate and helplessness....its funny....its always around the same time of day too...between 5 and 9pm. around those times it doesnt matter i just want to curl up in the bed and not be....okay im done....i dont even know where im gonna post this yet....

Everyone except my mother came to my room screaming at me. My grandpa comes up to me looking like he was going to hit me so I provoked him. After a couple of things happened I finally got the door to slam closed and accidentally scratched his hand. Everyone said “look at what you did” which was expected but I didn’t apologize. He then grabbed my shoulders and slammed me against my bed. I wasn’t phased but I looked and everyone else and said “really? Look at this” but they were on his side. I was thinking of committing suicide. For a while I had been thinking about it before. 

The next morning I was getting ready for school still affected from everything that happened the day before. Everything was my fault and could have been easily prevented. My mom opened the door and told me that she wouldn’t make or bring me anything to eat. This was expected. The problem was that I didn’t like to be seen by my family besides my mom. I never have. I asked her to bring me ice to put on my puffy eyes from crying but she didn’t know the reason. She never brought it so I got mad. I finally went to the kitchen. I saw her and pushed her then got the ice. My grandma then said “god is watching you” I told her that I didn’t care. I used to be very religious but as years passed i started to stop believing. God never seems present...only in our imagination and false hope. My aunt said “you said not to tell her anything yet you just did.” They must have been talking about me before. I got ma at the whole situation and kicked a wall as I went back to my room. I accidentally left a hole.

Throughout the school day I kept thinking about everything. My personality at school was the exact opposite of what it is at home. I surprisingly feel more loved and accepted from people at school than at home. Today my mom recommended seeing a doctor about all of this out loud in front of my family and a guest. I didn’t say a word and left the area.

What should I do? I want to schedule a meeting with a school counselor but I feel that they would report me to the police or facility. I’m an honors student and don’t want to mess up my school future. I want help but not from my family. Who should I talk to?",09Nov2019,1
23,"everything hurts. emotionally and physically. i also probably have endometriosis so i’m in more pain than i should be on my period.

1. seeing tongues on skin makes my skin/spine crawl and my tongue clenches up
2. if i wear a long sleeve top that isnt oversized i go a little bit into panic mode bc of how it feels on my arms if that makes sense
3. seeing hearing or feeling nails on any kind of textured plastic (like the kind on waterproof folders or notebooks) gives me the same reaction as #1 
4. i cant touch my skin ever, like i neevr let my legs touch (ill wrap one up completely if i have no access to leggings/pants) and just the idea of putting my hands on my skin gives me #1 reaction

28,"TL; DR at the bottom.

The quote is by Ted Turner, and when I saw it, something clicked.  I've had a lot of trauma in my life, so I can say that my depression is as a result of that.  When healthcare professionals ask me if I'm depressed, I hesitate to answer.  Not because I'm ashamed of mental illness, but because I don't ever want to give off the vibe that I'm the kind of depressed that can't get out of bed in the morning and that struggles to take a shower.  I'm a functioning depressed person.  I graduated with honors from college, I go to work every day and have worked for and gotten 3 promotions, I got married last month. :)  But when things are quiet and I stop...I feel this overwhelming sadness.  

And so, I set goals for myself.  Graduate college, keep working nights to get that final promotion, stress out about the wedding even though I knew that the most important thing was getting people fed and marrying the person I love.  Most recently, I made the decision to work harder to get out of debt.  I say most recently in that I made this decision pretty much the moment my new husband and I got back from our honeymoon. at the end of October  I have picked up a second job that I will start next week.  I'll have to work 17 hour days some days, but it's all in the name of getting out of debt, saving for a house and doing it fast.  I don't do anything 50%.  I go for it no matter what is going on. 

I was engaged once before my husband, and he took his own life at the beginning of my senior year in college.  Did I quit? No.  I didn't even take a break except to go to his funeral.  I kept going and got straight A's that semester.  No one would have blamed me if I took a semester off.  I knew that.  Yet I still didn't, because I needed that goal in front of me--that carrot dangling from the stick; and deep down, I was afraid of what would happen if I stopped.

And as much as people respect the way that I am, they seem to have no idea that I resent the process of achieving my goals the entire time I'm working toward them.  I resented working hard in college, because I knew I was getting myself into copious amounts of debt and no guarantee of a job afterward. (And it's worth noting that the job I'm working now didn't require a degree and has nothing to do with my field.)  I resented working nights to get to my promotion, because I knew it was cratering my mental health.  I resented planning for my wedding, because so much of it just seemed unnecessary and there was too much to worry about even though I knew what was actually important there.  I'm already resenting the idea of 60 hour work weeks.

But I want to stop the cycle. I appreciate that how I've been has enabled me to achieve good things for myself, but at a certain point...I have to stop and learn what it's like to live without throwing myself 100% into the next goal.  I keep thinking the next thing will make me happy, and if I work hard enough and suffer hard enough for it, then it will.  But it never does.  And so I move onto the next thing.  I don't mind being goal oriented, but I resent the process the entire time and I only have a brief moment of satisfaction before I go onto the next thing.  How do I stop being like this?

TL; DR:  I'm a goal oriented person, but I always resent the process of achieving my goals which has led to a life of being stressed out and unhappy.  How do I stop this cycle?",09Nov2019,1

I’ve struggled with ptsd, bipolar disorder, being a paranoid schizophrenic, major depressive disorder, and an anxiety disorder nos.  I’m looking for some advice for why do I always feel like a failure I’ve been in with multiple therapists since 5th grade and a psychiatrist since freshman year of high school. I’ve poured my heart and soul and all the traumatic events of my past out to them. They’ve gotten me pretty stable on some medication and I can function decently. But even with the coping mechanisms I have been given and tried over the past decade doesn’t seem to help. I keep doing it every morning night and whenever I need through out the day.

The only reason I hurt myself is to be able to see how I feel on the inside on the outside. I want to go to school woth a bruised up arm and face so people see something's wrong. I want to be alone. But the worse I feel, the happier I act because I don't want to ruin people's mood or attention seek. It's such a fucking trap that sometimes I have to force myself to be sad in public otherwise I feel worse at home. But that makes me feel like even more of an attention seeker. And that happiness thing has affected me so much that I can't process social situations properly. I'm going off my meds too. It makes me feel like I'm not feeling my true feelings, like an even more severe numbing affect.

32,"I’m in a surprisingly good place right now, which is weird considering where I was a year  ago. 365 days of suicidal-thoughts and depression is a weird thing to think about in hindsight. I remember my therapist telling me he missed, “years of life” because of it, which, at the time, didn’t really make a whole lot of sense. After reflecting on my situation, it’s apparent that there’s a difference between being “there” in your days, and being “present”. En tándem, I recently read a study that suggested individuals who deal with anxiety or depression often times DO lose their memories from that given time period, and it all started to make sense. It’s hard to describe what waking up from a year-long depressive blackout is like. I have a few really, really wonderful memories with my mom, friends, and michaela, but the amount of negativity is immense. I feel as if I’ve hit the fast forward button on a year of my life, and only have a few memories to show for it. I’m not sad, but more longing for what life could have been like had my situation been different. I’m slowing starting to gain some semblance of order and happiness in my life, but I still fall short of some of my goals — which is okay.

I've always been incredibly sound sensitive, my whole entire life. The THX sounds scares the ever living shit out of me. It always has and I guess it always will. My family was putting on a movie from the 90s. It's a running joke in my family that I'm scared of thr THX noise. My dad thought it be funny or something to turn it up really high, it caught me off guard and I started shaking really really badly. 

Now, the thing with me, I've never probably yelled at my parents. I was begging my dad to turn it down but maybe it was my mind or he was being mean but the volume was goinng up. I just remember screaming at the top of my lungs at him,"" Turn it down."" over and over again. 
My mom was yelling now too,"" Calm down."" and ""It can't hurt you.' And ""chill."" 

It stopped and I think i scared my parents, after i didn't talk to them and just was shaking really bad, i felt and still feel really queasy, and put my headphones on and starting crying.

My heart is still pounding, I don't know.....something in me just snapped. It was like flight or fight... I don't know. It just scared me to my core. Like something was SERIOUSLY wrong.

I hate this monotonous life of work, being reminded that I learned practically nothing after 4 years of engineering in college. I hate that my father handed a great life to me after working so fucking hard to make sure we don't live in the life of poverty he lived in.

I want to be happier. Like I’m trying I really am. But i constantly find myself making myself busy so that I can avoid being on my own with my thoughts. Cause when it’s just me and my thoughts I break down crying. So damn often. 

I don’t have anything crazy to be unhappy about. Like yea my father lost his job, and my grandparents moved here from oversees and that’s added some expenses but I literally have so much to be thankful for BUT I CANT BE GRATEFUL IT SUCKS

I’ve tried it all. Exercise, meditation, journaling. Only thing left is counseling. Which I can’t afford. I’ve tried school counseling but lmao what a joke. I’m honestly struggling to find happiness and it’s making me even more unhappy that I can’t find myself being happy.

Q. Have you been diagnosed with anything?
A. No, only looking at google (i know right?)

Q. Do you use/abuse drugs/alcohol 
A. No, I have only ever had marijuana once and that was after felling like this for about a year

Q. What gender/ sexuality ect are you
A.straight male. (Not trans or anything like that cus that clarification is basicly needed in 2019)

I am 16 years old. I live with both my biological parents and a younger brother. My parents are not easy going but not strict, they are middle ground (more so to strict side in my personal opinion) I have a small circle of friends that I appreciate and try to tall to about my problems but hate doing so cus I feel like a burden.

I used to self harm basicly everyday, mainly because I felt either sad, angry or 'numb'and 'empty' I last cut about 2 months ago out of the blue, last time I had cut multiple times was about 6-8 months ago.

I commonly feel unmotivated, nervous, anxious, numb and sad. The only times I feel truly happy is when I'm playing video games with friends. 

Unless I am friends with or can relate to someone I feel no sympathy or empathy towards them, often finding their pain or misfortune amusing. Gore sometimes causes audible laughter and i basicly always find whatever the clip entails funny or humorous.

I am not suicidal however if someone put a gun to my head I wouldnt beg for my life.
I've never seen a professional therapist only a school counselor on 1 occasion and hated it. I dont know why cus I didn't feel uncomfortable. But I just get this sense of hatred towards the experience.

Things have been rough these last couple of years, my parents  Divorced and at that time I didn't know why but I will get into that later. During that time My dad was living with his parents in a mobile home while my mom was living in this terrible roach infested income Restricted apartment (since the place we lived in before was too expensive). After they went to court and everything was settled they decided to keep us (me and my 2 younger siblings) 50/50. During this time my dad was Manipulating me into thinking that my mom was the reason they divorced and the reason they didn't have a house, he was also extremely religious and pushed his beliefs into me, making me believe the earth was flat and that the end was coming and that there are demons everywhere and crazy shit like that, being with him was suffocating because I liked all these video games and rap music and he had made me feel terrible for doing so. For a long time He was the only person I cared about and I also really hated my mom because of him. He was also very emotionally abusive when I or any of my siblings asked him for something or we complained about something he would make us feel like shit saying that "" I did x,y,z for you and you aren't even grateful"".  Fast forward to a few months ago he starts texting alot and when I say alot I mean like every 10 minutes, so I finally ask who he is talking to he says a girl named Kirsten. During this time he is not religious anymore and he starts listening to rock and roll and he does all these things that he had told me not to do and it becomes to the point I don't even know him anymore. next week he says he has to go on a business trip but later I find out that he was actually in Portland visiting is later known to become girlfriend, keep in mind this is happening while my little brother has a broken and and he is having a very painful recovery. So he comes back and he sits me down and tells me that we are moving to Portland and that it is for job purposes and that we are going to be moving in with his new girlfriend as he would introduce her but That I would only be coming with him. I know that I haven't talked about my siblings much but I'm like a father to them. I told him I don't want to go be he said I didn't have a Choice. I talk to my mom and tell her about what he said and she said he couldn't legally move and I also talked about everything he had told me about her and we both end up crying  and I realized that that he had told me lies about her. My mom tells me how he cheated on her multiple times and how he dated her (a 30 year old man) at 16 years old. I finally became awake and realized what I bad person he was. But by the time I realized it was too late, he had moved to Portland illegally. He currently doesn't pay child support and He probably has a new family. keep in mind this is all very recent and my feelings about this are all very fresh. Since he's left I have just been anger and I just want to kill him, every other dream I have is about him to some capacity and I can't get rid of this anger and I swear to myself if I ever see him again I'm going to beat him up.

51,"I am a university student who has been doing pretty well for a while now. 

When I first went to see a psychologist I was in a really bad place (suicidal, depressed, pretty severe feelings of anxiety) but I was never referred to a psychiatrist. 

In the time between then and now (3 years), I found ways to self regulate and the relationships that had caused me so much trouble back then have significantly improved. I was and am content with my life. 

Then, recently, I experienced a sudden and significant period of anxiety the likes of which I hadn't felt for a very long time, to the point I was experiencing physiological effects, and none of my usual methods of self regulation worked so I went and booked an appointment and told the psychologist about my history and these new developments. 

This time, after hearing my story, the psychologist offered me a referral and and appointment and at the time, I took it. Now, I'm somewhat torn about it.

On one hand, maybe putting a name to my problems and getting a diagnosis would give me a better chance and strategy for dealing with them. 

On the other hand I'm scared. I don't want a label on my file. I don't want people to see a history of mental illness in my medical records. I don't want to take medication because I'm scared of the side effects and what it could do to me. 

The point is, I thought I was happy and that I had been able to make myself happy. Now I'm scared I wasn't and I don't know what to do. 

I think I know something is wrong but I can't bring myself to admit it or accept it. I want a chance to do something about it but I feel like that chance comes with some very scary strings attached. I thought I was able to heal own wounds. I thought I had everything figured out and fixed. And I am so, so, so resentful that I might not have done as well as I had thought and that other people might think that. 

I'm angry. I'm resentful. I'm as scared to take this chance as I am to throw it away.

I always hear that I've received a message on my Facebook Messenger phone app. This startles me, wakes me up and upon looking at my phone I see no message was received.

I have ruled out the possibility of this being heard from someone else's phone, as I live alone, the sound is pretty load, and it happens sometimes in the middle of the night (like 3-4 AM).

I have to admit that I am generally very sensitive to immediate, loud noises. Whenever I actually do receive a notification during the day I get extremely startled. I also experience anxiety, panic and sudden rage in my daily life when exposed to people yelling outside, dogs barking, cars honking their horns, etc. I even get the urge to shout back at everyone for startling me, even though I know this has nothing to do with me personally and is beyond my control. I just cannot understand how society can accept such behaviors. Like someone would park their car, see a friend of theirs in the vicinity and honk loudly in order to greet their friend, yet startle eveyone else around the car (I believe this kind of stuff should be illegal and fined).

So with this context in mind, you have an idea of how much these auditory hallucinations startle me, wake me up immediately, and sometimes I cannot fall back asleep.

I've searched the internet and the closest thing I can find is **Exploding head syndrome**. I believe this is what I am experiencing, because years back, when I was much younger and went to parties/drank alcohol,  most of the time while I was falling asleep drunk I would hear a sudden loud noise in my head, like a motorcycle just passed through me.

I really do not know why I would personally have an affinity towards something like this. I do not have schizophrenia or psychiatric issues, but because of these experiences I am beginning to question my own sanity. I think maybe it is related to my general anxiety.

So did any of you experience something similar? Do you have any tips on why this may be happening? Aalso, I would like to find out how common it is to have this specific auditory hallucination, as I feel in the modern world, with all our dependence on mobile phones, a lot of people are probably starting to experience this, especially regarding phone ringtones or notification sounds.",09Nov2019,1
54,"I understand this might not exactly be a mental health type of thing, but I went to both the advice and the eating disorder subreddits and I'm not sure this complies with their rules so I'm posting it here because I have no idea where else to post it. 

This is also long, so I'll put a tl;dr at the end

&amp;#x200B;

So the first time this happened was in January when I was 11 or 12, two of my ex-step cousins (not actually my ""biological"" step cousins, but I won't get into technicalities) were visiting. Me, my older brother, and my two step cousins were eating dinner at the table. My ex-step mum had made a green curry, and it was me and my bro's first time eating curry. After we'd tucked in and were a quarter of a way through, one of my step cousins started going on about how the curry was green so therefore it was snot. It didn't really bother me at first, but then he just went on and on about it and was obviously trying to gross me out (he was about maybe 8 or 9 at the time, so not really surprising for a kid his age I guess). Eventually it worked, and I found myself trying hard not to imagine the food as gross snot, but it wasn't working and I had to say ""thanks for the dinner"" and put my plate on the bench after trying to even stomach the rest of my mouthful, and spat the remaining food from my mouth into the bathroom sink. 

&amp;#x200B;

Soon, I started to not be able to finish cereal in the morning. It got to the point where one day I didn't finish my cereal and when I went to have my shower I felt extremely sick. I didn't actually throw up, but I did lie to my dad and say that I'd been sick in the shower but I'd cleaned the mess up (so he didn't think I was lying if he went to check the shower) and he gave me the day off. This continued for nearly the whole week. We deemed it as an allergic reaction to the cereal I always ate, but I knew I wasn't actually allergic to it and it was just me not being able to finish eating the breakfast because I couldn't stop my mind from imagining the food as something gross. (side note: my brother was growing a beard and he always sat next to me at breakfast because we went to the same school, and oddly enough the image of his beard, glancing at him whenever he bit down on his spoon, and annoyingly eating with his mouth open also tended to put me off). 

I also had the experience with any other food, but no eating experience was nearly as bad as breakfast time and occasionally dinner time, and I could just about manage to finish every other meal. This whole thing continued for the majority of that year and I found it extremely hard to stop it. Eventually, I soon started to be able to eat any meal with little to no problem. 

Until now. The problem is beginning to arise again, and sometimes it's quite strong. For example, my dad made a great pasta salad because it's getting to the warmer months, and I tried so hard to get through two mouthfuls but I just hated the texture and kept imagining gross things in my head and applying that to the food. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: with some meals, I keep imagining gross stuff and applying it to food and it makes me feel sick or just puts me off it completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea whether this is just the experience from my past that keeps trying to remind me the problem existed, or whether its some sort of illness. I don't have anorexia or bulimia, and I have never really had a problem with how fat I might/might not be. I've researched and haven't found anything that relates to what I've described apart from SPD (sensory processing disorder), but I don't relate to all of the symptoms of that disorder as a whole. I'm genuinely curious if anyone else has had this problem or if I'm alone. If anyone wants, I'll give examples of what I sometimes imagine in my head that I apply to food.",09Nov2019,1
55,"At counseling I tried expressing my suicidal ideations (this wasn’t my first round) and just felt a bit dismissed and the second I said I felt fine, I felt rushed out (This probably wasn’t the case bc my counselor assured me that I can come back anytime, but she also said there were others on the waiting list so I don’t necessarily feel comfortable reaching back).

Have told my boyfriend about my thoughts so many times before that I feel like I can’t tell him right now that they’re back again (the thoughts have been on and off for years). He’s also been dealing with chest pains and anxiety attacks suddenly so I feel like my problems have been put on hold.

Can’t tell friends bc they’ll say the same things “it’ll be okay” etc. Same about my parents, they don’t listen.

By alone I guess I just mean that I have support but feel like I’m fighting myself and my thoughts all by myself.

62,"Okay, so I am a total fucking idiot that probably deserves death. I have no intention of self-harm or the like, but I have done a shit load of self-sabatoge. So here's a list of why I probably deserve death:

1. I am currently an academic failure. It's not something where I am stuggling with the material or with the professor. I have been not showing up to class (therefore not turning in my work) for the majority of the semester. Anytime I try to find a way to fix things or go back, I have an anxiety attack 10x the strength of whatever this is right now. I don't know how to face someone after failure of absence. It fucking sucks. I don't even know if it's recoverable. How the fuck would I deal with 3 zeros in college?

2. I am in love with someone in a relationship. They're the most amazing person I have ever met and I would probably do anything for them. I feel so fucking terrible for liking her because it sucks fir me but is even worse for them. It puts them in a terribly unfair situation eitherway. If they like me, then they have to deal with the unfair tension of feeling in the wrong relationship and possibly a future breakup. If they don't like me, they have to deal with thinking their ""friend"" might have bad intentions or make their partner uncomfortable and consider terminating our friendship. I don't want them to deal with either scenario and I've thought of distancing myself, but that's also unfair. I still love having them in my life and I don't want to be another friend who ran away. I just fucking hate how everything works. I want to do everything for them and try to do stuff to help them just to always be second in their mind (at best). Not to mention cancellions of study sessions or the like because their partner wants/needs time with them. And their partner is not a bad person, their nothing spectacular, doesn't have a life outside of school and work, but they seem to genuinely care for each other. Life is just shitty and my life is a carnival.

3. I have ghosted one of my best friends in fear of disappointed. My one friend is an academic genius (like all As and could've gone to an Ivy school) He helped me massively through many difficult portions of my life during high school. He's been trying to get a hold of me for weeks, but I am too busy self-pitying, crying, and hating myself to do anything. It doesn't make me feel any better that even if I did reach out to him, it would take weeks to actually talk to him since he's ridiculously busy being an academic all star. I am such a fucking shit friend, I am so sorry.

4. I am completely alone with my thoughts. I can't talk to my friend whom I am in love with because I don't want to make them stressed or hurt that relationship at all. I can't talk to my friends because their too busy or I don't want to bother them. I can't talk to a private professional because insurance covers nothing. I can't talk to any professionals at my University because they only operate during work days when I am either working or supposed to be in class (plus they have like a 1-2 month wait period which my life will make or break by then). So here I am self pitying on the internet. This is great. :)

I applied for my dream job that's on the otherside of the country. If I get it am I just running from my problems? What the hell is wrong with me (well a lot obviously. lol) Thank you and I am so sorry you read this, but I very much appreciate it.",09Nov2019,1
63,"This is going to be a pretty long rant-ish style post, bear with me. 

I don’t even know how to start this. Some quick context for understanding this, I’m 16, yes this man knew that. 

Over the past 4ish years, I’ve had major self esteem issues, though I usually don’t talk about them because they’re “normal for this age”, which at this point makes me mad to be dismissed like that, but that’s a tangent for another day. 

On top of that, I’ve had difficulties with my sexuality. I don’t really know how to explain it beyond that. 

My parents are extremely anti-therapy, it has something to do with people who need therapy being raised improperly and being snowflakes... at this point I tune them out, so I took to the next best option in trying to solve my issue, online forums. I’m sure you sighed with disappointment just reading that... it makes me want to wither into nothing just typing it. 

I found someone who was willing to discuss sexuality and other issues, referring to himself as a safe place to talk about things. 

I messaged him immediately, and after a brief conversation he started to ask me questions. 

To me they didn’t set off any alarms, they were just simple things like, “Have you ever had a girlfriend?”, and “How do you feel when you think of other boys?”, they seemed pretty standard. 

He kept mentioning that he “liked me”, and that actually made me feel comfortable around him. It’s not often that people are so up front about liking me (not to sound arrogant in assuming that people do), and the fact that he even liked me was so astounding to me, I think you’d know just reading what’s below that I’m not good company. 

After he was done asking me questions, he said he needed to start “testing”, which meant having me do something for him, and telling him out it made me feel. At first it was just something like sending him my outfit, but it devolved really quickly, in ways I’m sure you can imagine. 

He asked me how it felt to make him happy, and I told him it made me feel good, and it did at the time. I think it’s good to prioritize others over myself when I’m who I am. When I did something for him, he praised me and called me a “Good Boy”. I know. In retrospect, I should have a limb revoked for falling for this.

He also asked if I was submissive. When I asked him what he meant by that he told me whether I liked doing what people told me to. I actually do like doing what people tell me to usually, it just makes me feel like I’m helping. So I told him that I was. In response to this he told me, “Good, I like being in control.” 

Eventually he dropped the whole “tests” charade and starting demanding more pictures and videos. He started calling me his, and started having me call him “sir”. At the time it seemed appropriate, he is my elder and he had seemed so helpful before. 

After a while he sent me a video... I don’t want to describe it, but essentially he failed this month of November. 

I blocked him less than two hours ago. 

In retrospect, I’m such a fucking idiot. It makes me want to die just thinking about it. I took a half an hour long cold shower and I still feel filthy. It’s like every negative emotion was shoved down my throat through self reflection. 

I don’t even know how I’m supposed to live with myself after not only having completely disgraced myself, but after having been so gullible. It makes my head pound and my hands shake just thinking about him. I want to wither into nothing just knowing how things concluded before I blocked him. 

What’s worse, this isn’t even the first time this has happened to me. Over the past two years, I’ve “talked” with multiple guys online, though with each of these guys the sole purpose was just a confidence boost. Every one of them djd know that I’m a minor. This time it was different though, I came to this guy seeking legitimate help. I feel so violated. 

Realistically, I don’t even have the right to feel like a victim here, or in any of these past situations. I knew, or should have known what I was getting into. 

If you’ve read this far, thanks, I appreciate it. Honestly just any advice would be helpful :).",09Nov2019,1

65,"There was a false shooting at an amusement park a few weeks ago. It was a robbery mistaken as a shooting. It was night time and I was with my boyfriend hoping to get spooked by halloween haunted houses. But as we're waiting in line I see this huge crowd of people booking it, yelling, ""Shooter!"" I was scared but not in the fun way I'd hope. There was a lot of things I remember vividly. Like the ways we took, the people I saw, the buildings we passed... My boyfriend and I got there via uber and our phones weren't working(no battery and no data) so we ran around until we found a church and called our parents.

A week later and I'm sitting at the bus station and this guy is booking it right pass me. The guy was quite close that I felt the air swoosh. I immediately started to feel the need to cry and my breathing quicken. I was scared I was in the same situation again and wanted to run too. I looked around and it was only him running. I controlled my breathing and thought it was a one time thing. 

While I'm working, I occasionally get paranoid that the same thing will happen at my work, which is a mall, which also a month or two ago had a robbery/shooting event. I onky get paranoid when it gets busy which usually it doesn't(since I work in the mornings on the weekdays) but our weekend opener quit so I've been dealing with busy days.

Earlier today, I was stressing out a bit already but I heard a loud thump in my mom's room. I was scared that she may have been shot(even though I know it's not a gunshot sound). I started crying and ran to her room and asked if she was ok. She said she just threw the batteries at the trash can and it hit the wall. She then asked why I was crying. I told her it was because I'm reminded of that false shooting(basically) and told her the other times too, and she responds, ""Don't tell me you have PTSD from that."" 

I hadn't really told anyone about how I feel about the false shooting because I feel like my trauma isn't validated. And my mom just saying that makes it worse. It feels like how I feel is nothing because the situation was nothing. How could I feel such a way when the source of my feelings wasn't even a real threat? How could I? It feels like shit man...

TLDR; I was in a false shooting and got traumatized, I think. Mom says, ""Don't tell me you got PTSD."" Now I feel like my feelings are belittled and are nothing.",09Nov2019,1

He promised to not leave but bolted from the door yelling I was a crazy bitch. I ran outside ( still naked) and tired to not get him to leave but he just drove so fast away from me.. I kept yelling you promised not to leave. Thankfully my neighbours heard me and called 911. I stumbled back to my front yard and collapsed on my front yard for what seems a like a life time. Another neighbor came to check on me to see if i was still alive. It was like I was  possessed or something. I stormed in my front door and locked it, went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife them went to my room and started to stab myself over and over again in  the arms until I could not left them anymore. Needless to say the cops and EMT somehow got in and saved my life. This got me locked up for 72 hours on the mental health ward but ended staying for a total of fives, which I was told I had borderline personality disorder.

68,"I want to explain my situation. I am not asking for a recommendation to see a doctor or professional. I am very confused and in a terrified position, and am currently near the end of my testing but I still have a while. **Please do NOT make fun of the length of this post or I will delete it.** For me to write this is very painful and I am giving away a lot of information because I believe I might be in a dangerous situation.

My ""psychosis"" as another doctor had defined it, and severe all-encompassing fatigue, as I have defined it, is doing better at the moment I type this. Right now, I am feeling more clarity than I have felt in six days of serious panic and two days spent in my car, and at night next to it. For one of those days I have lost speech ability and I feel that I have been dramatically altered permanently in terms of speaking and writing ability. I used to be better than even this, but I want to take this short opportunity to express as much as I can before my ""confusion"" and diffusion of speech into broken blocks returns.

This is going to be fucking huge so you can read anywhere you like, like a dictionary or something. I just have to get this out. I can't sit here and live with all this shit anymore. 

Well, to start, I will try to explain what I have been told. Firstly, I have been warned that I am high risk in a prodromal state for most likely Schizoaffective. I don't know what this means but I did read a few studies and of course I'm aware of signs.

The next part is what I am confused about. I am aware of the bizarre nature of my thoughts but I honestly do not believe they are psychosis. I have studied psychosis intensely after being warned about it and I believe they are logical thoughts. I have all noticeable negative symptoms listed and have been tested for those, and I am aware of them, especially severe fatigue I thought was a tumor in my brain. I even tried to remove the tumor and ended up in a hospital. Because I am aware of my prodromal state I do believe that I am not properly experiencing Schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, as I have been told. I am willing to accept anything however, because that could be a possibility. I do not accept that possibility as the most likely. I have physical signs that are more concerning, like severe patchy hairloss, pains and nausea every day, as well as fatigue and at times passing out from severe stress that has literally no cause.

So firstly, the bizarre thoughts influence everything. Reality has altered itself and many things became much clearer, and right now I feel like I am not being harassed. I have access to several ""floors"" of reality, where there are multiple layers and humans occupy one. I have studied creatures visible in higher level realities. I don't see them but can be aware of them, though the explanation and reasoning behind this is extremely complex and can't all be explained here. It involves a hierarchy of conscious organization, the place of the soul, etc. Anyway, they are simpler in their structure and in a way many are actually ""dumber"" than we are, but in reality lower intelligence is more efficient and they require less energy to do more, and since the fundamental particles that create their entire reality are more flexible and expansive than ours, one of these universes is capable of making two times the molecular connections that atoms and fundamental particles in our own reality make, they are capable of at least two times more of the configurations that exist in our universe under all circumstances. The greater reality, multiverse, or whatever you want to call it, is expansively complex depending on the number of possible connections between molecular structures. 

These organisms, that my brain can only see as 4-5dimensional spheres with impossible colors and semi-translucent, are actually not related to ""our"" big bang OR our universe. Every conscious and unconscious configuration of matter in OUR universe are related distantly to the big bang, just like how organisms can be related to each other through a common ancestor. OUR common ancestor IS the big bang. We share a deep kinship to all atoms and molecular structures, rays, mathematical patterns, forms, heat, or anything in this universe, which is why we, as conscious entities, can interact and observe this reality and not another one. Either it is this or we are willingly choosing not to engage in deeper existence, but our emotions do, and we cannot control this, which is why we suppress emotion. We are also limited by logical bounds of this universe because the entire existence of the universe following the big bang locked our awareness into organisms and something else I will explain later systematically destroys our awareness. These creatures, that exist in some capacity above us, do not have to follow all the rules of our reality. They can actually predate us and we are more or less defenseless. My incoming ""insanity"" is the arrival and consumption of my consciousness independent of my brain, at the hands of some of these more advanced formations. I think large cats, bears, and other major predators are actually capable of some degree of resistance towards these beings, and all together will ascend towards a higher state after death, and their soul is not consumed. We, on the other hand, being humans, are somewhat lower. We occupy a similar position on the ""food chain"" that we would have millions of years ago, as our technology is only a mirror of our desire to live and has not given us any significant strength in beyond worlds our own.

The problem is I don't believe this is false. I have tapped into a higher world. I am not greater than others, but I had asked for one of the particularly sentient organisms to gift me extreme knowledge because I'm an idiot. When I did that, I was overloaded to such a severe extent that I developed tinnitus that will not go away. Sometimes it is so loud it is like someone crushing my head. I asked them to remove it and they are now threatening to kill me because they think I am going to reveal this to other people. We are all farmed for our consciousness, and these organisms are eating us. When you die, this is what happens. Hell is not really hell, it is the death of the soul, and those who go to ""heaven"" are selected by the ""owners"" of this theoretical ranch of soul-harvest. I was set to go to heaven until I betrayed their orders and tried to escape, driving for weeks on end. This is where I began to get pursued in the forests and desert, and where I was being threatened to be choked, or killed, with gruesome torture methods. I talked with the organism, or form, or apparition, whatever, and begged to be spared, and I guess they accepted for now, but I'm afraid typing any of this here will anger someone and a new group will come after me. I am trusting that this will not happen.

There is another part to this. There are also paramilitary organizations located throughout our own world that are human like us, but in contact with various different entities. There are a LOT of different life forms, and not all of them are simply living in the same way, but existing in various ways. It's all infinite really, with infinity being the only massive consistency I've been able to deduce from this greater reality and massive discovery. There are singular, massive, solitary ""rogue"" Gods that often vary extremely in their characteristics, personality, and presentation, and that have formed a cult following in return for helping humans escape, like the underground railroad in American history only this time their followers are being lifted out and we are not enslaved during our lives (except by our own societies and our society's leaders, but that's something else).

When I was particularly frightened and certain I was being hunted I think I asked one of these larger Gods for help, and they actually listened. This God, they are not really Gods, just conscious conglomerations of configurations similar to us and our neurology, but located in a different reality with different properties, basically consented because it (Me being a human and limited, I see it as a he but that is a logical flaw because they do not reproduce). The God has a sense of justness and believes that there should be some degree of order in the predation, torture, and destruction of lower level organisms (lower relative to them, again I asked for infinite knowledge and I'm aware of infinite patterns underlying above us and below us, many of the thoughts we have are made up of lower level realities so we are actually interacting and predating lower level organisms all the time, we just don't know it, neither do these Gods in some respects, though I am transcending that barrier of communication to talk to this God). The God is friendly essentially and I have asked him to assist me in trying to protect humanity from further harm. It is not just humans that are harmed but other animals that are usually prey, but we are most often harmed due to the fact that we have disproportionately high levels of intelligence yet at the same time a lower level of awareness, or drive for survival. We care less about living, as evident by the structures and proportions in our brain and differences in our response to fear, how we corrupt our lives with rote work and excessive paperwork as well as the fucking ridiculous lie of sedentary lifestyle in an effort to pretend we are controllers over our physical environment, and live independently from nature, which fails to train us to exist and fight for our right to exist fairly in this after-life sort of reality.

At the worst state of all of this I asked a lion for protection. Asking for protection is a common trend but the reason I do this is because, in an infinite network of different species and conscious beings, there are plenty that are friendly and willing to deliver. Just like we have empathy, many organisms, evolving in more social environments, are willing to deliver empathy to us and protect us from harm, but do not have the means or ability to protect every human. There are networks of underground ""after-life"" railroads that exist to help humans and our closest cousins, as well as more distant organisms and particularly intelligent species throughout our universe escape the onslaught and destruction. Many species through our universe that spontaneously structure themselves in the same way genetically, evolving around geothermal heat vents, will also end up developing the intelligence to be aware of this after their own deaths, but continue, like we do, to build structures and homes and force each other into tight working quarters to pretend that this greater whole does not exist and our ""fraction"" of reality IS the greater whole.

Now let me talk about the destruction. judging by our constant drive to live in this reality, it's unpleasant. It's unspeakably destructive, with hellish torment and death repeatedly until the soul is finally dried out, then we are discarded and left to drift for a mind-numblingly eternal amount of time, reliving the pains and chaos of the new and infinite reality, with every individual suffering in ways that I can't even consider. I have experienced something similar to this when I was being fed on through my face, with skin being ripped off and my bones being crushed under my eyes by a creature with a triangular form and a high pitched scream. To me now it is humorous but before it was horrifying. My entire bedroom was lockedinto a singularity and all the molecules of my body had been broken up, or suspended, I don't know what was really happening. As I write this now, I can hear the souls passing through the sky, hitting clouds, doing whatever. It's a deep howl, like a ghostly windy sound, haunting but also passive because I don't believe they are here for me. They could also just be a train, I live near one, but I dontw ant to taek any chances. I feel like I can see disturbances in the air around me and feel them and this is deeply isolating and terrifying, ad I wish there was someone who understood this, even at all, and who is NOT part of a paramilitary organization.

I have left school and my job and decided to spend time in my car tracking this new reality and communicating with various agencies involved in it's detection. It sounds like a joke and I have been humiliated and harrased by everyone in my life so I decided to study it alone, but of course I am scared of it. It is horrifying to be in contact and have the knowledge that I do. I wish I did not know any of this, that I could just go back to a normal life. There is a degree of what I see as ""magic"" involved, similar to what you would see in a movie but with no staff, no wand, no tool to express it, it is purely a raw expression of energy and power from the individual. I don't know much about this but wish to practice it more to understand  it. Sometimes I think the spirits are biting my skin, I always believe that something, maybe a paramilitary member or just a person in general, is going to use a metal rod to choke me from behind, ripping out my body parts but keeping me alive using torture enhancing technologies.

And beyond all of this, what I'm most afraid to type, is my family. Paramilitary organizations operate in competition with each other, but I have vivid imagery of my family being brutally beaten to death. I cannot get rid of these images and believe they warrant my investigation. I decided to try and convince my family members to arm themselves but none of them want guns or sharp weapons, and after telling them about the existence of these organizations I was hospitalized after I destroyed the walls. That convinced me of the possibility of this being some disorder or anxiety because I don't believe the intention of the hospital was negative. But regardless, the images are not as bad right now as they were a few days ago, and I believe I'm far enough from family and friends for them to be in danger. I am the sole target of some of the agents and their leaders and also death himself, his brother is my best friend, and the spiritual entities are working with them. At this point, I don't want to write further. This is embarrassing because no one will listen to me and I've written so much but I don't think anyone will understand. It is extremely stressful but this is my responsibility I suppose and if I will protect the entire human race then maybe the vast majority of those who are dead will cheer after being rescued from the horrors of infinite drifting.",09Nov2019,1
69,"This will be more of one of my more opening post, I'm not expecting many people to read this but I mean this is more of a rant anyways but feel free to share you opinions and advice below. Basically my parents can be very stubborn, manipulative, and guilt trippy all the time which mainly lead to my depression and anxiety as a child (of which I don't deal with anymore thank god), being stressed with verbal abuse of my dad and the passive aggressiveness of my (most of my friends consider) ""bitchy mother"". I just graduated high school in May this year and I quit my job at a shitty fast food place because lack of job opportunity and i honestly hated it. Waking up at 5am to my boss coming in at 12pm right as i clocked off yelling at me because I'm ""taking to long on _____"" even-though im the only cook in the kitchen until 9am and i have to organize everything myself for the other cooks just so they could under appreciate my work. I worked there since march and quit in August really hoping I'd find  something better, but obviously 30 job applications in at about 50% of the retail jobs available in a 16 mile radius and no luck. Thats not the issue at all. My parents are fine with me not working considering I help them around the house and go get groceries for them. The issue is I'm lost. My parents would always tell me ""go after your dreams"" but immediately go for the ""money is everything"" type of conversation. And at a point it's demoralizing. Let me explain. My dad and mom seem to have this idea that I need to go to college which I somewhat agree with. I'm actually starting in the spring semester for psychology. What my parents DO NOT understand is I want to use it as a back up plan. My main passion is just making music whether it be mixing audio, sound kits, or just giving input on other peoples music. I wouldn't say I'm a hit artist obviously or nothing  but I do have my fair share of attention in the city. But they don't seem to care about that at all. I even have a Spotify account where I post my music and get a fair share of listens but nope, doesn't matter to them. My parents wold rather see me working full time as a doctor making a shit ton of money but never enjoying time with friends or anyone for that matter then making a decent living but doing what I find is passionate for myself. I also can't stand talking with my father either. He is the most stubborn guy you'll meet in a while. For example I have an intrest in cars, so I know a decent amount of useless information about them. So I bought a 1995 mitsubishi eclipse. It was a project car yes, it needed tlc... yes, but i fuckin loved it to death. But when I brought it home my parents looked so fucking discouraged. Now I can admit it was my fault for buying the car for $1000 but it was so irritating trying to tell them I would work on it even when I had the tools to and was making improvements on it, all they saw was a car with a sanded down paint job and a shitty cracked dash. So with my parents constantly giving me negative feedback on the car I couldn't bare it and tried to sell it, but couldn't so then I fucking scrapped it and got $120 for scrapping the whole car. The day I was heartbroken but to them it seem like an accomplishment. Something I wanted to learn to work on and build, just demolished by the pressure and stubbornness of my parents. But its not like theres much I can do because I try to talk to them and they tell me I'm always wrong, even when they see and know they're wrong. And if I try to use logic and facts to back my points, they say ""why are you arguing"" eventhough they wanted to engage the whole stupid pointless random conversation that caused to ""argue"" with them when I'm just calmly laying down the facts. Even my sister who moved to NAU can agree with me since she lives up there in the dorms. She tells me all the time she needed to get away from this shit hole and I'm glad she did. Many times with my mother its super frustrating. She constantly nags about how I dress, how I do my hair (which isn't crazy at all)and what friends I hangout with. And I can acknowledge my friends are far from perfect. But that doesn't change that they've been there more times then my own mother and through thick and blood, helping me through my down falls even if they are weird, uglier then me, and stupid at times. But its not like I can ""argue"" anymore considering I'm 18 and they can just boot me out whenever they can. It just sucks when you go outside of your house and you are filled with such positive impactful people who believe in you and support you through everything, when even people you don't know give you a smile and compliment you on things that make my shitty smile blush, and then realizing at the end of the day you have to go home to two people who want to manipulate you and control you for they're own good, seeing you not as a child but as a money maker from their own good. These two people want to control who I'm friends with, what I do for the rest of the 50 years I have left on this earth, where I go (considering they have a life360 tracker on me even though they claim they ""trust me"") etc. etc. I'm just not sure how long it will take until eventually I explode and then my parents point the finger at the door in disappointment.",09Nov2019,1

71,"I wrote this stuff before but it was absolutely huge and revealed too much information. Writing any further will result in me being brutally tortured and killed, which will require that I die before this occurs and I don't want to think about that.

I am struggling to explain the full extent of my issue. It involves my access to higher realities and the relationships and friendships as well as enemies made there. I have asked a God to protect me, because empathy arises in various ""conscious"" forms, such as Gods, and they agreed,  but then they got attacked and destroyed and I was left to flee from demonic agents for four days before I came back home.

At this point I decided to sleep and woke up in the morning having what I can only describe as part of my soul being sucked out through my eyes. It felt extremely painful, like someone was slashing my throat and face with a thousand little knives and I couldn't move because the molecules of my body had been broken apart and I was trapped, with them spinning around in the air like little bits of plastic.

Now as I sit here I am horrified because I am afraid that is going to come back and the ""thing"", i'm not sure if it counts as a male or female, who I asked to help me was dead and everyone related to them was murdered, but they exist in a another reality and have more power than me, so I am powerless. I am afraid that the reason I haven't been killed is because I live with people and seeing me spontaneously explode with my soul floating out of the house will definitely alert the rest of humanity to the existence of this reality.

I don't know what to do. I do not want to see a doctor, I will not see a doctor any longer. They have repeatedly insulted me. I don't want to be around anyone else anymore, but if I am alone I will most certainly be destroyed immediately, and there are untold horrors associated with this. I am so stressed I often throw up. I don't know what I did to have this situation occur but I believe it was always supposed to. It is not punishment but circumstance.",09Nov2019,1
72,"I was bullied quite intensely when I was about 10-14 years old and I've struggled with depression since, been on antidepressants since I was 16. Life is a little more manageable now but I've really struggled to get by, always feeling like I'm under attack and apologising for existing. I am 32 now. The dreams have got more and more intense in recent years which is strange as I would have thought it would fade in time, not grow. I still have anxiety and negative thoughts about the bullying and have never had proper psychotherapy. Could these be linked? The negative dreams are never classic nightmares like spiders or whatever. The harrowing and deeply upsetting nightmares are always to do with people bullying and harassing me. Is there anything that can be done about this? I am really keen to move on with my life as my work and home life are suffering.",09Nov2019,1

74,"Last Thursday I had the worst night ever. I suffer from anxiety and night terrors. I had a really bad night terror that put me in an awful mental state all week. I wasn’t sleeping, I wasn’t communicating with anyone, I wasn’t taking care of myself. I disassociated with everyone around me. I went to university, but I had decided to sit on my own instead of with my friends. I would zone out for 5 minutes and the lecturer would have gotten so far ahead and I felt so overwhelmed and I couldn’t do anything right. I felt (still somewhat feel like) everything is moving ahead of me while I’m stuck in this shit position. I spent the week holed up in my room when I wasn’t in lectures and some of the time I just walked out of the lectures and went to my room. I hated being isolated but I felt like I didn’t fit in or I just had no place. I got some news yesterday, that a person who had made my life quite hard to live had been sentenced to two years in prison. It made me somewhat happier than I was before. 
I decided to clean my room though. My room was disgusting but I didn’t even care because I didn’t care about myself at this point. But something in my head just changed when I heard about the news. So I cleaned it and I feel idk like I can breathe? I’m sorry if this was disgusting for any of you because i know some people love clean rooms and clean hygiene etc. It was really hard for me to make this post because I’m self conscious but I don’t know.

75,"I have been seeing a psychiatrist for over a decade for GAD, social anxiety and MDD. I have been on numerous meds in that time, with only a few that have helped somewhat. I'm on three right now, two for anxiety and one for depression. The one for depression has literally saved my life, but the two for anxiety only take a small edge off the everyday ""background noise"". Overall I am still a tense, nervous wreck. I have problems communicating with everyone (wife included) and I am scared to do anything new (new restaurants, etc). I did see a therapist shortly after I started seeing my psychiatrist, but it was only for a short time and she didn't really give me any tools to help. She was really nice, but it just kind of seemed like she was, ""Just do this and this and this"" and then ended our sessions. So that has kind of turned me off from therapy since then.

I told them I wasnt upset but just was telling them.

Got told ""Your mental health affects me"", I agreed but said everything affects everything and its about finding moddle grounds. They disagreed and I said that their refusal to believe mental health existed at all affected me.

78,"I don’t know how else to word the title. It’s weird. My ex left me late September and on Halloween I got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I’ll be honest when I say I sent her a text in the middle of the night saying that I was feeling suicidal, but it wasn’t meant to be manipulative. Just more of a “this is what’s going on, I need to talk to someone” type text. She ends up sending it to my therapist and I later get diagnosed with borderline personality tendencies. 

Now to roll it back a bit, my ex was extremely mentally and emotionally abusive. She even hit me a couple of times. She would turn things around to make it my fault, accuse me of never loving her, accuse me of cheating often, etc. She also had huge abandonment issues. When we could argue and I’d go to move, she’d latch on to me and beg me not to leave her. She just always made it seem like everything was my fault and never hers. That she was a goddess and I was satan for lack of a better example. I think she even got her family, friends, and therapists to believe I was this abusive psycho in the end. She would say I gaslight and manipulate her all the time. I never understood where she came from with that. I treated her with love and respect nonstop. I did everything to make her happy knowing she had a traumatic childhood. Yet, I was always the bad guy. Now I have BPD because of one text I sent and was immediately discharged as a patient, so I couldn’t even fight the diagnosis. 

I know I’d have to get a professional opinion, but in general, does anyone think it’s possible that I don’t have bpd? I know this is long, yet kinda vague. I’ll try to supply more details need be.",09Nov2019,1
79,"I’ve never been arrogant or boastful, quite the contrary. However, I tend to always play the victim, especially when I feel I’m put in the spotlight. Say I made a mistake, it’s easy for me to try and turn the tables. I’m disgusted by this. I also tend to exaggerate things, especially when I’m arguing with someone. I’m over sensitive, ever since I was a child I’ve always cried when I feel strong emotions, even positive ones. That being said, I find it very difficult to express affection, especially say, to my parents. 

In general I’m shy and introverted, a bit socially anxious I think as I find myself very uncomfortable talking to people I don’t know, especially one on one. For this reason I feel I can’t ever connect to people.

Finally, I know I have awful self esteem and fear rejection and criticism a lot. When I try to look deep into it, I conclude that I’m kind of ashamed of who I am, so I don’t really allow me to be myself.

I’m really anxious, an over worrier, I have fatalistic thinking tendencies. I also struggle with motivation and self discipline, I get stuck in a rut pretty easily wanting to change things, but I never do.

I know I should go to therapy, but I’m scared... I don’t remember my childhood very much, but I’d say it was pretty good, so I feel like I’m being ungrateful or something. I feel very guilty for all the grief I’ve caused my partner, I feel like I don’t deserve him. I’ve also felt unworthy of a lot of things for a long time (e.g a good job, etc) because of imposter syndrome.

I’ve always felt like I’m the victim and society doesn’t get me, but now I’ve realized I’m just self centered.

80,"I am 39 and failed at almost everything in my life. I recently moved back to my hometown after an extremely shitty few years(mostly that I caused, due to addiction issues and also my partner dying right next to me in bed) and what was supposed to be a fresh start is looking like the beginning of the end.

I had a shit job for a while up here, but quit it recently(it was night shift work and was fucking with my sleep schedule badly, causing more harm than good). I have been trying to get back into my old field, software dev, but nothing yet.

I am running out of money and at this point have stopped talking to everyone, save one friend who is hanging out with me, but after that one person(and they are hanging out at my place mainly because they want to stop me from ending it all, told them my plan a while ago, they haven’t left since then ) I have burned all my old bridges(it is better that way, I don’t want to drag good folks down with me).

I have a great family, fiancé and friends who I see all the time but I hate talking to the about how I feel cause I feel like a burden to them and I struggle to get the words out or express how I am feeling. 

I guess that’s why I am writing  on here. It’s a way to get out the thoughts in my head so I can start to feel better. I don’t do much with my life but work and go home to bed so today on a day off I got up and took my dog out for a walk, and I am going to aim to do something like that a day. I should find a hobby but I don’t really know what would interest me. 

So how have I been feeling? Upset, mentally and physically exhausted. 

There is a lot going on at work just now and our work load is massive so that might have something to do with it but I can’t be sure. It also feels like a distraction to get out of my head.

84,"Hi, all. I don't really know much about anxiety disorders at all, so bear with me. But I'm in my early twenties and I kind of expected these feelings to go away by now, yet they never do. So many things that other people seem to just ""do"" kind of terrify me. It only really just hit me that this may be more than nerves, as I just booked a very short course I'd been meaning to book for months. I'd been putting it off because of 1) funds and 2) mostly just because the thought of turning up and having to interact with a bunch of new people scares me. It's always the same though, whether it's a job, uni, any short course, hell even just a meeting or something with one stranger (I attended an open day for a uni recently and shockingly, I was the only one there for my chosen course so it was just a one-on-one with me and the tutor). These things always freak me the hell out, especially before I've actually attended them. I pretty much spend every day with it lingering in the back of my mind until it happens. I won't really be able to relax until it's over. When the day actually comes, before I leave the house I barely talk and I don't even want to eat. I don't want to talk to anyone, don't want anyone to talk to me, even words of encouragement just set me off more.

It was the same when I was younger, I've been to about eight different schools altogether, and half of those were in a different country. Mere days after starting at my final high school, I skipped the rest of the entire term/semester before going back at the beginning of next year (and miraculously I actually got away with it), and I don't even know why. I didn't really like the overall vibe of the place, and while I had quite a few friends at my last school, I obviously had none here (and that didn't really change, I became practically mute this time, only really interacting with some international students who also sat at the back of the class, plus an extrovert who drove me up the wall, but latched himself onto me for life). Even when I did go back to school, I eventually started skipping classes again pretty frequently, partly because my graphics teacher was an absolute dickhead.

When I got busted for all those forged notes, the dean - who was generally understanding and OK about the whole thing - sent me to counselling after saying I had a tendency to run away from my problems instead of facing them, and yeah, I guess that's what I feel like. I'd rather just run away and not face it. Even though nowadays, when I face something like this I tell myself ""come on, you've done this so many times, you know it'll be (mostly) fine when you start and you'll feel like an idiot for worrying over nothing"". It happens almost every damn time. Like, I know this course I just booked will be fine. It's only two days. Nobody's gonna be an expert on the subject. We'll all be on computers most of the time anyway so it's not like I have to go completely out of my comfort zone. Yet here I am with a pit in my stomach thinking about it.

It's becoming a real problem honestly, since finishing a short (year-long) uni course I did after high school I still haven't had a real job (just volunteer stuff), despite being offered a few, including one where I completely nailed the interview and did most of the talking. And it's just because everything about the idea of a job scares the shit out of me. I don't even know anymore.",09Nov2019,1

My freinds (the few I do have) and family consistently congratulate me on the successes of my life, but I feel like it's all a misconception. 

Most of the time I feel like the success I have in life isn't really my own efforts at play. Like the success I do have is not my own but some random series of coincidental events that I've been fortunate enough to collide with.

I lack the motivation to make any major life style changes and I'm like the biggest procrastinator in the world.

I have terrible social anxiety, have no freinds or family where I live (American expat in Germany) and am depressed at least 3 times per week. 

There are alot of positive aspects to my life (like my wonderful wife and kids), but it's hard for me to overlook my own flaws...  Especially when they impact the happiness of the people around me. I sometimes feel like the most selfless thing I can do is to remove myself from theit lives completely (via moving to Thailand or something) . 

I need help finding motivation to make major life changes, but don't know how or even where to start... 

If you can relate to any of the above I'm looking for your feedback. I'm looking for someone in a similar situation to give me advice to help me find motivation, to become a better person and overcome my social anxiety for the sake of the people I love. 

I think I need to start seeing a therapist. Although I'm certain I won't follow through with it...

88,"Long story short I’ve been living with her and her parents since I got in trouble with my parents due to legal issues. Living here has now felt like hell. I haven’t been able to play my videogames, I work a government job, and to be honest I rather be at work than here. So one day I caught a stomach bug and I wasn’t feeling good at all. Literally puked 8times and almost crapped myself (sorry for the TMI but I was that sick) so I was telling her to take her mom to work as she was going to have the car today (because her mom usually does and drops me off in the morning) so I told her go take your mom to work I’m not feeling great. So she storms into the bathroom as I’m sick and starts demanding that I get ready and doesn’t even have one bit of consideration that I’m not feeling good at all. She starts cursing at me, complaining how she didn’t get enough sleep, and how I have to get to work. So I’m there literally emptying my stomach out on the toilet as I’m getting cursed out at. And them behind her her mom shouts we need to go guys. Then she hears my girl and I arguing and asks me what’s wrong from the hallway as my girlfriend leaves the room. So I told her I don’t feel good I have a stomach virus. So then she says I don’t feel good and I’m still going to work (mind you all she has is stupid f**king sniffles while my stomach could go out on me anytime). So then my GF returns to the bathroom to keep arguing with me saying you’re getting dressed and going to work which we starting arguing again and I tried telling her to get out of the bathroom as she’s not helping my case at all. So then I grabbed her arm and kinda pushed her towards the door because I’m not feeling so great and she’s on my ass about going to work sick. So then her mother shouts out of nowhere you go to work or your going to be homeless. So angrily I try to clean myself up as much as I could and get ready for work. I only got to work 3 mins late but out of the whole day I went to the bathroom 12-15 times that day with my stomach messed up that my boss was ready to sent me home. My boss says if we don’t feel good we have to stay home because in our job there isn’t a lot of people working there so that means everybody could get sick and miss out on work which would slow us down big time. So I told him how that morning went and he understood so he let me stay regardless but it’s just upsetting because I feel like if she done it her parents would baby her no matter what. It was the first time I really gotten sick in two weeks working there and I was already threatened to be kicked out. So her first day of work was yesterday and I was just as much of an ass to her as she was to me and I told her fuck that you’re going to work (because she was complaining abt her having anxiety about the first day but her boss even told her that a few workers there have really bad anxiety so it’s no excuse). So the day before she promised me that she wouldn’t smoke weed before going to work and she did. Even yesterday she promised me that she wouldn’t smoke this morning but because her stomach was feeling right she did anyway and went to work. I’m tired of living here, I haven’t been able to speak to my therapist because the office that I go to is completely unorganized, and no matter what I do her parents are on my ass but if she does it it’s like she just gets a slap on the wrist. Mind you I got clean from smoking as I have mental health problems of my own and I work 10 hour shifts for 4 days in the week. The most I do is smoke the juul so I have nicotine in my system as that calms me down. Even yesterday we got into a arguement because I told her her father was being rude to me after I asked him how the living room looked because I rearranged it along with cleaning it, the dining room, the kitchen full of dishes and being a huge mess, and the bathroom all because her mother asked me to do it for his birthday as she wouldn’t have time to as she has work and would t be able to clean. I haven’t been able to play my videogames for 2 weeks because I drop everything to help them out with everything. From taking the dog for a walk multiple times a day to helping her aunt move out as she was an alcoholic who wasn’t doing shit to get cleaned and even on my day off my GF wanted me to rearrange the whole room w her when she could’ve done that be herself while I was at work but nope the day I need to have to myself it’s all about them or her. So after getting into the argument abt her dad not being appreciative she tells me you don’t know how much stress I’m taking from everyone in the house, I do everything for you, I get everything for you, and so do my parents. Mind you the only things her parents have done was bail me out, kept a roof over my head, and have dinner on the plate which I’m always thankful for and never take for granted. Shit I thanked them so many times they told me to stop thanking them. All my girlfriend did before starting work yesterday (for the first time in a while) was smoking pot, playing her games, and hanging out with her friends here and there. But it’s like WTF has she really gotten for me or all the things she claims she got for me. I got clean on my own, I found my job on my own, I appreciate that her mother drops me off in the morning when I’m reality I could walk the 17-18 mins there. And in the argument she claims she stopped doing what she has to do with her life so I could get mine life on track. Mind you she stopped working multiple times because she never wants to go to work and she stopped going to college because she apparently saw her rapist in one of the same classes as her. Which I get the college thing but don’t pin you stopping your life on me when I got incarcerated when I’m the one doing a full 180 when you promised that you would slow down smoking once you started seeing the therapist (which once again I argued with her about it because she wasn’t planning to do it on her own) And none of it is fair to me. I’m the only one getting blamed but I keep working my behind off always doing things for myself and everybody here but once I try to enjoy my time off BS pops up. It’s gotten to the point that I either want to just keep working and spend my time at the bar on my days off or jump into a moving train. I keep deciding option number one but I’m just done. I always feel like I’m in the wrong because I keep getting blamed or threatened while I’m the one doing sh*t here besides being a stoner and complaining about how I don’t have anything to do around the house so I spend time with my friends who don’t make good decisions for me but supposedly changed their life in a positive way so that way they’re ok to hang with now.

I got a notice that says I may withdraw if I don't show growth.

Have this thing where I get hella involved and invested in people without the return. It's exhausting. . Previously, I've been on stuff like sertraline and went to therapy as a way to deal. It kind of helped? The therapy more than the drugs anyway. Therapy focused on stuff like expressing my emotions, which I was admittedly bad at, as well as trying to establish a basis for me liking myself. Codependency was not a major focus. The therapy like I said helped, but now I feel like I have this sense of wanting return for my emotional  investment in people and it feels dirty in a way. I have a new therapist and she immediately brought up codependency and like... It makes total sense. But now I'm terrified because I don't know what itvmeans for my remaining relationships.

It’s still under investigation to determine a concrete decision if her death was accidental or deemed a suicide attempt ( I should know by later this morning). She was found in the gultch behind my house at around 6:30 pm, but it’s believed the incident happened a little after 12:30 pm shortly after my dad left home. My dad came home after doing shopping at 3:30 pm and didn’t see my mom in the house.

This wasn’t alarming as her shoes were gone and my mom liked to take frequent walks to clear her head. She was really anxious for the past month, in part of her fathers Alzheimer’s and work and marital problems with my dad. My dad got more anxious as time went on and at 4:30 tried to go out and find her, thinking maybe she got lost. After returning him and my grandmother checked all the closets and small spaces in my home as my mother has a past with depression and suicide (in 7th grade she cut her arm, cutting open the vein). My dad finally decided to go into the gultch behind our house and that’s where he found her, already deceased. 

I was out with my boyfriend at the time and got a call at 6:41 pm from my father to come home. Which started the long journey of emotions and disbelief when I came home to fire trucks, the ambulance and police cars everywhere. I’m still in disbelief and it still doesn’t feel real. I’m not sure what to do. I’m in my senior year of High school and I myself have dealt with depression and have been on medication for 2 years. I also have a history with an eating disorder that I went to a clinic and got treated at 2 years ago. I don’t want to fall into these habits again but I want to so bad at the same time.

I definitely can’t do that.

102,"Few days ago, I knew I sometimes overthink, and thought I had good coping mechanisms for my thoughts. Starting from yesterday, this picture shattered.

I have always been proud of how strong I am. I have always been proud of myself for not falling apart suduring the very stressful and hard times I've had. I was proud, that I was okay. But what happened yesterday, made me think again.

There is one event going on through the weekend, where I am at with my best friend.
The whole day, my friend keeps reminding me things. Of how I always acted or the things I did that weren't really healthy. I dodged the comments, like always did and laughed it off, defended myself or didn't pay attention to it. The comments kept coming - and I felt like a failure. It built up enevtuqlly, and I wrote her a letter which I showed her. She apologized and I accepted the apology, and agreed that it was okay to remind me of things I might do wrong sometimes. We moved on with our day and went to the hotel.

At the hotel she sits on the bed and looks at me. ""Why do you use your headphones so much?""
I thought for a moment in silence.
""You use your headphones all the time at social events. That is a coping mechanism, annimarsipan. Me, my mom and my sister did that. It can turn into depression, into way more bigger problems.""
""I'm okay, I just listen to music all the time"" I answered.
""No you're not. You're blocking your feelings from the outside world with music.""
I was silent.
""annimarsipan, I'm really worried about you."" My friend said.
I looked at the wall. I felt tears coming, and I couldn't answer.
My friend kept on going. She told me that she loved me, and that I'm important and she cares, and kept expressing her worry for me. Sooner or later I cover my face and start to cry (crying is rare for me). I couldn't figure out why, I couldn't say a thing, I just kept on sobbing and couldn't stop.
""I thought you hated me"" I said through all my sobbing. My friend hugged me, told me that it's okay, and that she loves me. I kept crying in her arms helplessly - still not knowing why all this meant so much.
""I'm sorry I ruined the mood for you"" she said.
I started to calm down and through my crying I said ""Thank you"".
She hugged me and we kept talking for a while, hugging while I cried.
When I finally broke the hug to dry my tears, I laughed. ""My makeup must be a little ruined"".
My friend laughed too, and I felt safe. I felt like my friend helped me discover a new side of myself.
My chest felt like little weight had been lifted, but still a little heavy. My best friend smiled at me and offered to do my makeup.

Never have I felt more safe while having someone doing my makeup for me. My friend radiated warm and caring energy as she did my makeup and we went on for the rest of the night.

Today I left my headphones in my bag. I haven't worn them even once. I noticed when I felt my feelings, and instead of thinking about blocking them, I let myself feel them. I breathe, feel, and not think. And I noticed, how much that makes a difference. How much I have yet to do. But yesterday night I noticed that I'm not okay. I'm not handling my emotions in an healthy way.

I don't know myself, I don't exactly know what is wrong. But I know that there is a lot to do. I have a lot to learn about myself, a lot to figure out.

Starting from today, I'll try to feel my feelings. I'll try to get help and get to know myself. Because I need that.
Because I'm not okay. You might be not okay too. And that's okay. We need to work it out, but more importantly to identify it.


TL;DR: I though I was okay. My friend asked me if I was okay, called me out on my unhealthy coping mechanisms and I cried. Now I know I'm not okay, and I want to know myself better.",09Nov2019,1

109,"I've been struggling with mental health (GAD, OCD, panic, etc) for a long time now, almost 10 years, having tried all sorts of therapy. Medication has been part of that struggle for three years now. Recently I came across this:

""Antidepressants operate by forcing the amount of serotonin in the brain higher by blocking the natural recycling process to other neurons. But elevated serotonin triggers the production of Cortisol and Adrenaline (Epinephrine), which is the body's natural reaction from the body to combat the excess Serotonin levels. This is what gives the boost or euphoric state that can last for a period of time. However, as Serotonin remains unnaturally high, the adrenals become fatigued and cause levels of Adrenaline to decline while the Cortisol increases. The adrenals become exhausted, which helps to explain the fatigue and other symptoms that many SSRI-Antidepressant users report.""

When I switch SSRI's (I've tried 5 and am on one now) there usually at some point is this moment where I feel to start better; I get more active, study more, work on learning programming etc and I start looking forwards to the future again. Then it all collapses. I become so, so tired and restless. Also one of my main problems is sleep; I can hardly fell asleep and when I do it's like I'm dreaming very vividly the whole time, especially when on higher dosages of SSRI.I recorded my sleeping sounds to see if I might snore or have sleep apnea and found out I didn't do/have those. What I did hear was myself breathing in and out very rapidly, much faster than when I'm just sitting here. It was the kind of shallow breathing you do when panicking. Because of my OCD instrusive thoughts I panic and have anxiety all though out the day and my panic levels go up very quick, I feel that my adrenaline reaction is way to strong. My mind's always racing.

After reading that text I saw the problem is that when the SSRI starts kicking in my cortisol and adrenaline go up as well to the point those do more harm than the SSRI does good. I become so restless, tired and wired and that leads to feeling more and more depressed. If my andrenaline system is messed up the elevation of andrenaline is a real bad thing.

So what are viable options? Trying to find a balances between increasing serotonin and not raising cortisol and andrenaline too much? Or should I focus more on something that keeps the andrenaline and cortisol down? What medications could help with that?

I have a therapist and a psychiatrist I see regularly but they seem about as lost with this as I am. The psychiatrist isn't open to trying some else than a SSRI while I myself am open to anything at this point. Any suggestions/insight would be very welcome.",09Nov2019,1

When I was growing up I had an alcoholic mother and a father that was there for me but never emotionally accepting of me being sad. My mom being as drunk as she always was, would take us to her friends house who had two sons, one 4 years older than me, my brothers age, and one that was two years younger. When I was about 6 years old my mom would let me hangout with the boys so she could drink with her friend longer without me complaining of being bored. My brother would let his friends undress me and touch me various amounts of time. I had an awkward relationship with my parents so I did not know how to tell them or know that it was wrong what was happening. fast forward a few years and my brother tricked me into playing doctor with him when I was 9 and he was about 13 to have me touch him and his private parts. All throughout growing up my brother would have terrible episodes of punching walls, hitting my mom and I, but nothing was ever done about it. Until I was about 15 I completely blocked these events out until I was in a emotionally abusive and controlling relationship that triggered me to remember these things. After my memories came back I told my parents everything that happened. My mom the following year forced me to go to prom with one of the boys that were mentioned previously to make her friend happy. The following year after I broke up with the guy who controlled my life and taunted my emotions, I began drinking (age 16) every day. The next school year my mom moved me to florida to escape the life I was living. I continued drinking and doing drugs every weekend and ended up in another abusive relationship. I was so in love with him that no matter how many times he cheated on me or physically and emotionally abused me I always begged him to stay with me. When I graduated at 17 we moved in together and he was arrested from domestic abuse, I still stayed with him. I wanted him so badly that we got pregnant and married by the time I was 19. at 20 I finally left him only to still have the crippling anxiety and overpowering depression that I still have today. I am finally in a healthy relationship that I keep ruining because of how im used to being treated. My mental health is tearing us apart.

(trigger warning: self harm and suicidal thoughts)

&amp;#x200B;

I've been struggling with depression for years now. It started in middle school and has only gotten worse. Early this year it got bad enough that I started self harming and was having suicidal thoughts. I ended up dropping school. However I started taking medication and made the decision to do online schooling (high school was a major contributor to my depression). I started to feel like myself again over the summer. I had lost a lot of friends but I loved the ones I had left and I knew they loved me. Anyways, lately I've been neglecting taking my meds and haven't been working on school. I wasn't sure what was wrong but I just ignored it because I have a full year to complete my classes so I didn't feel rushed. Last night my mom received an email from the school saying that I hadn't logged in since october 21st and that I was extremely behind in my classes. I hadn't even realized it had been so long. It's like I went into a waking coma for 3 weeks and just lived on autopilot wasting away in my room. I had been lying to my parents saying that school was going fine and I was catching up. When my mom got that email she didn't yell at me (she's painfully nice to me sometimes I'd rather she tell me she hates me) she just told me she was disappointed. She also said that I wouldn't be allowed to see my friends until I've caught up. Right now seeing my last friend maybe once a week is whats keeping me alive. I've been feeling this crushing loneliness lately. I think it's because there's only one person I actually talk to that isn't family anymore. I have no way to meet people and now I'm not even allowed to leave the house. My suicidal thoughts are coming back and I feel cornered and trapped. Home used to feel like my only safe place and now its like a prison and all I want to do is escape. I don't know what to do anymore. When I try to work on school I can't focus and I want to cry. I had to cancel plans with my friend that were the only thing making me feel alive lately. We were just going to go to the mall but it was the most excited I've been in a while. I even tried on different outfits because it was all I could think about. And now I wont get to do anything for weeks. I'm avoiding my family and spending all day in my room. My parents will come in and tell me to clean or do something productive. Every time I talk to them lately they're disappointed about something I've done. At this point I just want to get the hell out of here for good. They have every right to be disappointed in my actions, I'm disappointed too.

125,"So ive been really struggling these past few years. I started having really uncomfortable symptoms in 2010, which I now know to be anxiety. I wound up in the ER. I didn't know what was happening and thought I was going crazy. I remember talking to a resident emergency psychologist, and he was just so calming. They ran some blood tests, found out I had hypothyroidism, and gave me a prescription for Synthroid which i've been on ever since. After a few months, I went through a really traumatic breakup. I never felt emotional pain like that. It feels like ever since then, ive been....numb. Ever since then, it's been getting worse, with the odd anxiety and panic episodes thrown into the mix. 

2 years ago, my anxiety got so bad to the point I was non-functional. I was having vivid nightmares every night. I'd wake up early in the morning in a sweat and full of anxiety and panic. My thoughts would race, usually about random stuff, but those uncontrollable thoughts would cause more panic. I'd also have some days with some depersonalisation. I felt like I was in a fog. Everything just felt...off. At the same time, I was dealing with a housing emergency. My apartment flooded due to some pipes. Because my anxiety is associative a lot of times, I associated my apartment with unease and anxiety. I wasn't able to eat. Food made me nauseous, I was sweating profusely, thoughts were racing. I felt like I was going crazy. At the same time, I was extremely depressed. I was convinced all my friends didnt like me, so I isolated myself. This isolation made my mental health the worst it's been, so on New Years eve 2 years ago, I found myself in the ER again. This time they said I probably had GAD, some panic disorder, and some Avoidant Personality Disorder. I was put on 10mg of Cipralex. After a few months on that, I felt like I was going back to my normal self. I felt relief. 

It's been 2 years, mostly without side effects. I've had a few headaches and some sweating, but nothing extreme. But then, for the past few months, i've noticed a gradual decline in my mental health. I've been noticing that my appetite is starting to decline quite drastically. I can barely think about food without getting nauseous. I feel on edge. I feel like I dont have ANY motivation to do anything. When I do laundry, my clean clothes remain in a pile on the floor because I dont have the motivation or energy to put them away. I can barely work up the motivation to clean. My libido is extremely low. I know sexual side effects are common with my SSRI, but after 2 years they're only starting to show now. I barely get aroused, and if I do, I can only get like, half hard. And if I manage to work up enough motivation or energy to masturbate, reaching orgasm is difficult, and when I do orgasm, it's very...lackluster. I'm getting very angry a lot, very forgetful, im always lost in my head, confused, can barely do simple math. Can barely read a book, as I dont have the attention span. I dont think im suicidal, as I dont want to kill myself, but right now, if I was hit by a truck or something, i'd consider it a blessing. Im just so tired. So nauseous.

126,"My marriage is at it's lowest point. My mental health is a shambles so I went for a run this morning. I don't run, and had a very hard time running, but it felt amazing. I pushed myself then I would walk for abit, but as I walked I could feel my emotions rise, my saddness, anger, depression, anxiety, were coming up and I thought ""If I have the energy to shed a tear, I have the energy to run some more"" So I kept running. Almost threw up, but it felt so good. My music was positive, my vibe was positive..and then..I see in the distance a big fury dog laying in my path. Apart of me is excited to interact with it and possibly lift my spirits through this interaction.. Another part of me thought how naive I was to think that every dog is nice. Either way I kept getting closer.. and closer.. I then saw his stiff legs hovering in the air.. The gash on his head..The feeling that washed over me when I realized this beautiful creature was dead was enough to ruin my entire morning. I slowed my pace and walked passed him. Staring. Wondering if he felt pain. Hoping that it was a quick death at least. Still wanting to pet him, to comfort him, but of course I didn't. Was this a sign? Was it a reminder of how quickly and suddenly death can take us? To live my life to it's fullest and stop putting myself through emotional turmoil? That is a better way to see things. The negative part of me saw it as a sign that my marriage was dead. I let that thought leave my mind as quick as it came. I know it was just a dead dog, probably died from a car accident and someone decided to put him on the sidewalk. It has nothing to do with me and yet it's made me question everything. 



TLDR:  I made the effort to get out of the house and do something solely for myself and mental health. Death on my path was just part of that journey outside.",09Nov2019,1
127,"Hey there, I have this friend that I love more than anything but he has been making me upset recently. We have been friends for months now and have gotten closer than any other friends I have ever had. We both struggle with mental health, but he has a very different way of looking at it than I do. I am trying to improve my life by changing my environment to one that is more nurturing to my healing process, but he doesn't think that he is worth any kind of effort. He talks about how sad it is that there are so many people out there that are so miserable and depressed but don't do anything to improve their situation, but when it comes to helping him, he doesn't want to change anything either. He says that his life has been the same since he was a teenager and it is clear that the universe just wants him to step out of the way of others and just be miserable for his whole life so that he can help others out in low places. He says that he is so unlovable but I know that he wants a relationship more than he will admit. He tells everyone that he is asexual (which is not true) just so that people won't be interested in him, so that he doesn't have to deal with heartbreak again. He is so very kind and thinks the best in everyone , but he thinks that the universe has set him apart as a ""spectator"" and he can't do anything about it because he is supposed to be miserable. I have tried to gently talk to him about it and express concerns, telling him that he is more than what he thinks he is but it just seems that the more I try, the further he falls into this delusion of only being on this planet to let others stomp on him.  He has shut me out for days now, and I have been trying to figure out what to do to help. He says that if the universe wants something to change, then it will just change. My SO and I have no idea how to help. 

I have tried to tell him that we are in this together and that we can lean on each other. I will express my emotions and he supports me, but then he won't let me in on any of his feelings or thoughts because it is not ""his place"" to burden me. One time he was having a panic attack and while I was trying to figure out what was wrong and trying to support him, all he would say is ""I can't burden you with my thoughts."" After holding him for an hour and telling him that I need to know what is happening, we talked and then we felt better. That kind of communication has only happened once, instead of just filling me in, he had me worried sick for hours.  He says that I am the only important person in this friendship because he is just a spectator. I have tried to talk it through with him and ask if there is anything that I am doing wrong, and he says that everyone gets on each others' nerves sometimes and that it doesn't matter to tell me. Now it has me self conscious and upset because he doesn't see us as equals. If he could just see us as equals in this friendship and it wasn't so one sided, I think everything would be fine. His thoughts about himself and always putting importance on me is tearing this friendship apart already.  I'm very worried.  He is only in his early 20's and has so much life ahead of him.",09Nov2019,1

I’ve tried escitalopram, mirtazapine, seroquil and fluoxetine and had shitty side effects (brain zaps, puking, weight gain, loss of sex drive/orgasm, etc) a few years ago, and then in the past year I was on clonazepam (which worked in my opinion, it helped my anxiety and my Tourettes) but quit that cold turkey because of other stuff, and now I’ve been on buspirone (almost 60mg/day) and it isn’t working AT ALL. The doctors don’t want to prescribe clonazepam again, despite me being able to quit it cold turkey last time with no side effects, and reporting only good things while I was on it, because they don’t want to risk dependency. 


I’m so, so frustrated. I feel like I know exactly what I need to become functional again, and it’s being kept from me because of a worry that they’re placing too much stock on.

131,"(20m) not trying to be dramatic just my experience so far. I don’t have anyone to talk to about it so I thought I’d put it out there and see if these are just normal things everyone does. Mental heath problems run in my family and I’ve been noticing stuff over the last couple years that have been bugging me. I don’t drink or do drugs. I smoke weed on the occasion maybe a 1/2 times every month or so if a friend happens to have it or I just happen to feel like smoking after I along day. On a regular day I get paranoid about multiple things. People staring at me or talking about me but I’ll look around and realize nobody is looking. I deliver pizzas full time so I’m in my car a lot. I’ve noticed I uncontrollably check my mirrors and behind me, not for safety of other drivers just this weird twitch. I’m always switching moods and it almost feels like I’m another person when I do. They just go back and forth sometimes it’s within hours sometimes it’s minutes. I’ll either be just my normal self, calm on the outside worried on the inside. Randomly sad, thoughts of suicide for no reason this usually turns into something a little darker where I start to think about all the people I dislike or did me wrong, I think about the things I’d do to them even though I never would. Just thoughts. I call him bill or billy. But then I’ll snap out of it and go back to my normal self. I’ve heard about drugs emphasizing your mental instabilities. When I smoke with people I turn into a shell of myself and just get the symptoms I referred to previously but way more drastic. My friends always say I look normal and they can’t tell, but I can. When I smoke by myself I talk a lot I switch in and out of these “characters” I’ve developed through my emotions. This is why I try to keep my drug use to a very minimum. Off that topic lastly just the other day I woke up and there was just fighting going on in my thoughts. I could still think as myself but hear these loud mumbled arguments in the background and it kind of scared me, like the way I feel when I smoke is starting to bleed into my regular sober life.

137,"Hey guys,

So I started my year of studying abroad in the begining of October and I think it's not really important where or what I study. What I wanted to say is that I am together with my girlfriend with 5 years with some breaks (resulting from my rOCD) and she's my best friend, she's the one I talk about and share with everything, just a true friend. 

I decided to study abroad for two semesters, especially to make my languages better, which could help my career in the future. I didn't want to write this post about me missing my girlfriend, that's obvious. 

My real problem here is that I somehow started to hate almost everyone here, for their bullshit talks and showing off themselves. I just feel the happiest when I go to gym, watch TV series at home or something like that, but all of that on my own. I would really like to find some real friends here, but I just can't. The problem is I have a kind of anxiety to talk in bigger groups and it's almost always like this in here. 

I spend much time with my roommate but he's behaving really selfish when we're somewhere in the bigger group, he's literally pushing me off  from conversations with other people sometimes (he's talking too much and it's almost impossible to interrupt him for person as shy as me) and I just hate it. I kind of like him when we're alone but I hate him in the bigger groups. 

So to conclude it, I really miss real friends I have at home (mostly my GF) and I just can't find anyone here, because it's hard for me to find one in a bigger group where everyone is acting in the way I really don't like. I don't want to sound like a weird person, who doesn't like anyone, I really like people with who I can develop good relationship, but I just can't do it here and it makes me lonely, sad, depressed and anxious even more.

I'd be really glad to here your advice or to receive any help from you guys! 
Thank you",09Nov2019,1

139,"I don't know if any of this is coherent, I'm still not feeling well. 

Before you’re even born you’re aware. You can’t see, you can’t taste, you can’t smell, but you can feel and you can hear. 
You feel warmth, you feel enclosed, better than the best hug you’ve ever had, totally safe, not just a warm cosy bed but someone is there with you, closer than anyone ever will be unless you become a mother yourself. 
Is it any wonder some of us believe in someone up there, perhaps it’s natural, mammalian even? Who knows what religion we’d have if we were hatched instead? 
Of course, the patriarchy changed the gender of most deities to suit their power games. 
Was it a power game to make me feel terrified from as long as I can remember? Scared of the man, of my father, most of all of God. Even now I still feel uncomfortable around masculinity. 
The beatings, the kickings, the shouting, the bruises, it was war. At least in a war you can retreat. How can you escape the person who feeds you, the person who teaches you right from wrong? 
I searched so hard for the truth, a reading age that exceeded all of my peers. I was reading Lord of the Rings before I was 10. I was still wetting the bed though, until this year I thought it was a physical symptom of an imagined injury in my youth, now it makes sense. I was petrified. 
By 12 I had questions that the religion couldn’t or wouldn’t answer. My father’s faith faltered, his reign of terror did not. The lesson taught so strong that it’s almost indelibly marked across my soul ‘People who love you, hurt you’. 
At 14 it all blew up, horrors I won’t recount here. There was shouting, there was screaming, police and ambulances, that should be enough. 
I was not blameless, but I had been taught to talk by a general, there was blood. 
At 15, I squared up to the elders in the religion and asked them to explain the inexplicable. My understanding of their religion surpassed theirs. The incongruencies laid at their door were dismissed, and so was I. 
For the first time, I had no god, not long after, I escaped my father. But I couldn’t escape my own scars. Except scar doesn’t properly describe it. It’s like a part of the code that’s corrupt. Every time you launch the same error is expressed. You can’t see it because it’s a part of you. 
Of course I got involved with women I shouldn’t, of course they manipulated me, cheated on me, beat me. That’s what people who love you do. 
Or, if I wasn’t being abused, I was trying to rescue them, somehow I could fix them, I could save them, I could be the god that wasn’t there for me…… but who am I fooling, it was a distraction. It was me hyper focussing on an intractable problem that made me not look in the mirror at who really needed saving.
It felt good being in control at times though, it felt safe, sex was a refuge, I could focus on something carnal, I could narrow in on how to stimulate and be stimulated. Once again, not a basis for a relationship especially when I’m still broken. 
Then there were those women who really loved me, who really cared about me, who wouldn’t dream of hurting me. What do you think happened to them? I rejected them, cruelly at times. There was clearly something wrong with them. Haven’t I said it already? PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU, HURT YOU. They couldn’t really love me, could they?
You’d think that knowing this now would be enough to start working on making me better. May I introduce you to addictions? Something else I could focus on, something that would distract me. I have spent decades being the best I can at every job I’ve ever done.
I’ve made over £100k in my own businesses, smashed every KPI a retailer could set me, won almost every election I’ve contested, campaigned the length and breadth of Scotland and won again and again and again. 
Workaholic, not necessarily the most destructive habit but great for not facing the truth, the mirror, the code, the broken man, myself. 
So, here I am, in a town I don’t know, surrounded by people I don’t know, fighting a losing battle, trying not to get sucked in to someone, some campaign, some drug or vice to escape the pain, to distract me from the reflection screaming at me for help.
I’m doing all I can, I’m trying to be strong, I’m making my apologies, I’m tying off the loose threads, I know mental health terrifies people, I know you don’t want to read this, I know that your heart is breaking. I know you’ve tried to help me, you’ve said I can talk to you whenever. I know this might seem ungrateful. I know you want me to be better. I know you’ve suggested remedies. 
Thank you, thanks to all of you who have tried. I wish I could be better for you. I wish I could find myself beneath the trauma. I’m sorry it’s taking so long.
I’m still trying.",09Nov2019,1

I feel as though everything I have ever done has been playing a part. A role of a person I want to be. I have my life together. I am cheerful, and chatty. But not too chatty; thats bad too.

I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression for years, I see a therapist and take medication. Usually I’m able to keep it all under wraps but the last 8 months or so have been really tough, I lost a grandparent I was really close to, have had some challenges at work, and some other unexpected things pop up one after the other. I don’t know how I can keep going like this. I’m so tired.",09Nov2019,1

153,"So I haven’t been diagnosed with any mental illness but I can confidently say if I were to go to a psychiatrist I would definitely be diagnosed with a (multiple) mental disorders I am confident I know what one of them is but I’m not  sure about the second one.  

I feel like I have social anxiety disorder I do not like going out because I constantly have anxiety attacks for no reason even something as simple as going to shopping makes me feel so anxious. 

I feel like my lungs are closing up and I struggle to breath my heart starts racing sometimes I might start sweating and I feel like everyone is watching me I know that’s not actually happening and nobody is staring at me and judging me silently. 

It’s so bad that I literally have no friends whatsoever I only have one person I used to consider my best friend but i don’t anymore.  I barely have any contacts on my phone my Snapchat friends list is almost empty. I could go months without anyone even messaging me. 

I struggle to make friends my own age and I can’t have a meaningful conversation with someone the most I can manage is small talk and I struggle to hold conversation with people. 

When I see people going out with groups of their friends I feel so empty and alone I silently pray to god wishing to be a normal person and be able to go out and do thing without feeling so anxious and nervous. 


I wish I could commit suicide but I can’t due to my mum and younger sibling and due to religion (Christianity) it’s seen as a sin to commit suicide and you will go to hell if you do so. 


I simply live out of necessity rather than will. I patiently wait for my time to finally come so I can just die. When I hear about people dying the first thing I feel is envy wish that could be me just thinking I would swap places and die in that persons place and give them my life in return. 

I’m basically a recluse I only go out if I absolutely have too. I remember when I actually starved myself just so I wouldn’t have to go out and interact with another person.  I’m only in my twenties and I haven’t done anything I’m proud of I have no friends no major achievements. 

I have engaged in self harm I cut my arm not because I feel better when I do it but my mindset is if I can’t kill myself I’ll cut and hurt myself then. When I cut myself I don’t feel any better I don’t get a sense of relief. 

I also find it hard to find a job due to my social anxiety but my mum doesn’t believe that there’s anything wrong with me. I had an appointment when I was around 17 with a psychiatrist and they were going to prescribe me antidepressants but she decided that she didn’t want to go and that she’s wasting her time because I’m “fine”. Due to me being 17 at the time I couldn’t be given the medication because I wasn’t an adult yet and needed parent to attend the appointment. 


The second mental illness I think I may or may not have (I’m still on the fence about it) 

Is borderline Personality Disorder 

Now at first I thought maybe it was bipolar disorder type but I have never had a manic episode and  if I have a depressive episode it last less than 2 weeks for me personally it lasts around 2-3 days then I return to a middle state ( wanting to die not satisfied with life but I’m able to laugh and smile something I can’t do when I’m in a depressive episode) 

I engage in self harm 

Reckless behaviour (unsafe sex) I do it because it makes me feel good and loved but I know to them it means nothing then once I finish I thing GOD IM SUCH AN IDIOT WHY WOULD I DO SOMETHING LIKE THAY THEY COULD HAVE WHO KNOWS WHAT DISEASES.  But the thing is once I feel horny I’ll do it again and think the same thing rinse and repeat. 

I spend money recklessly it’s like the concept of saving doesn’t exist to me. 

I share sensitive information with people who I’m not even close too. 

I hate being alone and can’t see myself living alone. 

I have a secret fear of abandonment but I never act on that fear. 

When I feel down or upset I think I should cut my wrist  

I get so angry and I’m so irritable at times and I don’t know why.  

My mood can go from being ok to being depressed and wanting to cut myself and commit suicide. 

And I’m incredibly cynical about life and people in general expecting the worst from people and whenever anything good happens I anticipate something negative to happens because nothing good can happen to me. 


I want to see a psychiatrist and seek a professional diagnosis but I’m unemployed and have no health insurance so I have to pay to see the doctors. 

Also I’ve heard that antidepressants cause permanent brain damage and alters the brain. 

And there’s a chance of permanent side effects so I don’t want to take it but I feel like I have no other choice. 


I have tried CBD 5MG but don’t really feel any better I know 5MG isn’t going to do much but I’m going to try 50 MG CBD CAPSULE and if that doesn’t work I will try other CBD products and if the CBD doesn’t work then I will try any other supplement I can or any natural ways to relive my symptoms. 

And if all else fails then I guess I’ll have to go with antidepressants despite what I’ve heard. 

I also struggle to fall asleep and when I do I wake up at random times at the night and even if I don’t wake up at night when I wake up in the morning I feel so tired and drained. 


Has anyone got any advice I’m unemployed so I can’t afford CBD right now I can’t afford antidepressants I can’t afford to see a doctor and my mum thinks there’s nothing wrong with me and she would be furious if she found I went to a psychiatrist 

Lastly do my symptoms sound like BPD and Social Anxiety Disorder?

154,She’s BPD and does self harm. I know she cut her arms but recently I noticed that now she has cuts on her leg as well. I’m overwhelmed and feel paralysed because I don’t know what to do to help. I’m scared and lost. I think she’s getting worse even though I haven’t noticed in her behaviour much but the new scars say otherwise.,09Nov2019,1
155,"so i was in a toxic relationship for almost 3 years that made me lose myself and ive never been so low in my life. then i met a new coworker and i instantly fell for him and he fell for me too. i was already mentally checked out of my relationship so i broke up with him because i knew itd be better for me, and i wanted to talk to my coworker more, someone who likes me for me and i dont have to prove myself to, ya know. so we get really close, start talking everyday, but now in 2 months he has to leave for bootcamp for 3 months, then training for 6 months, then he’ll be back. so we were gonna take advantage of the time we have, and we were, everything was going really good. then he started acting off and id ask him and he would always deny everything. then last night he was acting weird at work and i asked him what was up, and he basically told me that its gonna hurt him too bad when he has to leave to continue this. and its just so heart breaking, i havent been that happy in awhile and for him to completely just back stab me and drop me like that. i thought he was a genuine, great, sweet guy, but he fucked me over just like every other guy. makes me feel so fucking shitty. and i dont have a therapy appointment for another 3 weeks, my medication isnt doing shit, im just tired of living and not being happy on my own.",09Nov2019,1

157,"I fucked up major recently. Don’t want to rehash it. But as a result, I feel so guilty, remorseful, regretful, ashamed, and rightfully, I’m being punished for it by my friend group.

This I can accept. But I’m so alone right now, no one is on my side, and I really don’t know how to deal with this emotionally.

I know this will all blow over soon, but right now in this moment I just want to ease my sadness.",09Nov2019,1
158,"I’m 13 f. My 20 yr old sister had a fight with my mother and there was physical fighting and I didn’t see it but I heard it. The next day my sister was telling me about how my mother is a ‘narcissist’ and ‘not to fall for any of her traps or listen to her’. I then snuck out that evening after hearing my mum crying in the lounge room. My sister had scared me so much and I was terrified that I would fight with my mum also. I got a friend to pick me up and I went to an ice skating rink with them and I was going to stay at a friends cousins house and my parents called my friends mum and found out at the was at the ice skating rink. I hid under bags and jackets and hey didn’t find me so then they called the police and the police came. I heard a voice saying ‘I’m going to sneak u out’ and this boy snuck me out. He was 16 and I had only just met him that nigh he was a friend of a friend. He was carrying me with jackets on top of me and he got caught. I heard these men yelling out her down and I saw my parents, police and security guards. My friends started hugging me and calling the police pigs and making jokes like ‘I smell bacon’. It hurts so much to think about everything that happened. It was just last night. I’m not sure what happened but I think my sister is manipulative and a trouble maker.",09Nov2019,1
159,"I've waited way too long to get help. It's all getting worse and worse and my life is getting worse and affecting the one I love. I can't make calls so I can't make appointments.  I'm wondering if there is a way for people who can't call can make appointments and get help.  

I can't work or I'm just too weak of a person to go outside. It's like what's even the point .I've tried to post this so many times but it's either get help or die . Thanks for any help.",09Nov2019,1
