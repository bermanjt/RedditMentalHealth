0,"For the past month or so,  I have stopped enjoying life. Activities I normally love doing are now lackluster, and I haven’t really talked to any of my friends in a while. I haven’t really left the house unless I needed to, either. I know I should be doing things and having fun, but I just end up not having the motivation to do so. I don’t really know what’s causing this, and nothing bad or anything has happened. What is happening to me? Is this a temporary thing or should I get professional help?",18Jun2019,9

2,"LCSW vs Psychologist vs LMHC vs MSW.

I'm in the West Palm Beach/Port Saint Lucie area.

Trying to deal with depression, child hood physical abuse, bipolar disorder, among other things.  Took a lot of LSD (1mg) 1-2 years ago. Haven't been the same since.

I'm pretty self centered. Constantly depressed, up and down. Not sure what's wrong with me. Hate people. I used to be happy, working, studying, loving. Now I'm just afraid of living. Constantly feel displaced. Always feel alone. Pretty avoidant. I used to jump at risk and opportunity. Now I'm afraid to live it feels like. I don't listen to anybody. Always try to argue. When I drink I blackout. One time I was at a new years eve party and I watched myself float from my body and just watched myself standing there doing nothing and watching the world pass me by. It seems anytime people have stories where I was being fun and social I can't remember being alive for that time frame. 

I've seen university therapists before but they always just had me spew about how I felt and never offered a fix, I think one was a LMHC so that might knock that out already. When I told them I thought about dying but didn't want to kill myself they spazzed and threatened to hospitalize me right there. 

Who do I trust? Where do I go? What do I do? 

Why is finding good help for your mental health so difficult yet finding someone to fix a broken leg is easy?",18Jun2019,2

***I’m 14 and I take sertraline daily for anxiety and depression, and Vyvanse 50mg every 2-3 days for ADHD- I don’t take it daily because it keeps me up and I don’t eat because I don’t get an appetite. I’ve been hearing/ seeing things the last 6 months that weren’t there and am always paranoid that someone’s in my house or following me down the street. Whenever someone knocks at our door, I always think it’s the police looking for me. I get feelings that my friends are always trying to avoid me when they aren’t and when someone says a tiny insult to me it hurts me so much. My dad who passed when I was young had the same problems (hallucinations and shit) and I think that me smoking weed has a play in this- I smoke like every two weeks. I don’t want to talk to my***  ***physiatrist*** ***because I feel he’ll know about me smoking which I don’t want anyone to know. I’m now quitting smoking and am definitely not going to drop acid which I was planning on doing.***

I know this individual has a long-standing PTSD diagnosis—can these be symptoms of experiencing and distancing themselves from a recent trauma?",18Jun2019,1
6,"I just need to vent. 

My son who was born six weeks early is still in the NICU. We can’t seem to get over the hurdle of the whole eating thing. Since it’s been going on for awhile like this we are going to be transferred to a children’s hospital. If they can’t help he will get a g tube. 

I went to seek therapy last Thursday since I have met my insurance deductible. The therapist ended up not understanding me a whole lot because English was her second language. I cried  in front of her. I thought maybe I can just work with her and it will be fine. She was actually helpful.

I had went there 8 months before this and saw someone else but I could not afford it. Before I left last week I asked how I’d be billed and she said it would go through my insurance but today I was debited $85 through my bank. It was my last money until Friday and I’m scared I can’t afford all my bills now.

I keep being thrown all these challenges and I just don’t understand. I can’t get out from under this negativity. I pay for my son’s healthcare and healthcare bills. My son’s father offers to pay for nothing I have to beg him. My fridge is empty though I have rice and beans. Is this what it means to be alive in this country to never be able to afford mental health care or go doctors to never figure out why my son cannot eat. Do they just stand around to get paid witha title I’m so frustrated and lost and I have suicidal thoughts. I feel alone. My sister makes excuses  as to why she can never come to see me.

I don’t have my parents they are addicts and my push most other people away. 
Life is short but i wish it would end already. The Zoloft isn’t working and ever since I was a kid I have felt this way.

8,"so i feel like i have two different thought processes running simultaneously often and was wondering what the fuck it is

its very very hard to explain but its like. dual monitor mode on a computer but im able to do different things on both monitors.

my emotions are completely desynchronized with my thoughts where i can just be chillin and suddenly im overwhelmed with a giant wave of depression or anger out of nowhere, and want to die really badly even though im just sitting there thinking like oh its raining pretty hard outside. or suddenly im bombarded with thoughts that arent my own, i work in customer service and ill constantly have moments where they didnt even do anything wrong and my brain will be rattling off some angry rant about them when im pretty chill and normal on the surface... 

i also sometimes space out for hours and suddenly ill realize what time it is qnd feel like i hadnt lived the day quite consciously even though i remember it, its more i was on autopilot all day

im not formally diagnosed with anything and i have no idea where to start with my various issues but this one in particular is weirdest to me. ive undergone trauma and itd make sense if its a byproduct of it but i was just wondering what it was",18Jun2019,2
9,"I have never done this before so...bare with me.  I feel like I'm suffering from an existential crisis. I see so much stuff about climate change, permafrost melting, and a garbage pach the size of france. I also see things about what seems like the apocalypse coming thanks to climate change. It seems like no one cares that much. It makes me wonder how i do anything about it since I'm just one unimpressive spec in a seemingly apathetic universe.

 I'm also having a hard time trying to justify doing things like starting a family or pursuing any dreams if the end is actually near. I mean if the end is coming in a few decades, what reason do i have to bring children into the world?

 Again, frist time poster i hope i haven't made too much of an ass of myself. Anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with it?",18Jun2019,4
10,"So recently I've been very apathetic (depressive episodes being awful), but for the first time since high school I've been having thoughts of self harm, with a very weak will to act on them. These range from suicide, but only if someone close to me dies, or general self harm, but only by having someone break my legs beyond repair.

As well, I have become deathly afraid of certain events. Car crashes, deaths in the family, the onset of disability in myself (highly unlikely), and I have no idea why. I've experienced thoughts before but never so specifically, and never with such fear.

Does anybody know what this might be? Things are going well for me at the moment (minus a psychological dip due to figuring out about a lie my parents perpetuated).",18Jun2019,2
11,"
My depression is worse in the morning. I feel like there is no meaninful reason to live. I don't want to get up. Then I force myself out of bed. I don't want to eat but I eat anyway. When I start eating, I get hungry and eat very fast and eat many things (I am thin anyway so this is not a problem) My depression is looking at the world's beauty without being able to be part of it. I have friends but I don't see the point of seeing them. Feels like nothing makes a difference and want to abandon all of my projects. I spend my time staying outside or with my cat but when the depression is bad I just watch the simpsons or something like that and obsess on the internet about which mental illness makes me feel like this.

It's not so bad every day. Sometimes it leaves me as soon as I get out of bed. Some periods I don't even have it. I remember that my first period of depression was in middle school, during the summer, but it was because I didn't have close friends. Then in high shool it went away completely until during the third year of high school it came back. Anxiety started that year. I wasn't actually anxious, but I had chest pressure and diazepam helped it. I started smoking more weed because of depression (or maybe it was the other way around) and then I started abusing diazepam. I took all the 100mg bottle within 5 days. I talked in slow motion, fell asleep at random times, didn't care about anything (I was taking more than prescribed). One day I mixed it with weed and passed out and I decided not to take it anymore.

At the end of high school in 2017 (five years here in Italy) I tried several psychedelics. I was so amazed by those experiences that I didn't feel depressed anymore. Then at the end of summer I took mushrooms and I remember crying during that trip. I remember feeling dirty for the pain I had been giving to my parents (they knew I abused drugs). I felt relief while crying and things started getting better but I still felt this depression lingering despite the fact that my life was good. I wanted to take more psychedelics to realize the good in my life but since that mush trip it's like psychedelics turned on me. In 2018 took LSD twice having teerifying trips. In a desperate attempt to experience happiness again I took MDMA three days in a row and the days after I would have killed myself if I didn't know it was just the comedown. Then I discovered DMT which lasts for only 15 minutes and I had beautiful trips but when I came back to reality I still felt bad. At the end of the year another mushroom trip turned bad and after that trip things have started to go downhill. I had random moments of anxiety in which I lived the sensations of the trip until at the beginning of this year suffered from a mental breakdown (racing thoughts, heavy anxiety, feeling cold and shivering, sensivity to noises and lights, insomnia and sleep paralysis).

I recovered from it and I started feeling better. I thought that maybe it had been drugs' fault all the time. Started going out again, feeling like myself again, new activities, going at university again (before I did exams without going to lessons, as I'm doing now). Then randomly one morning I woke up feeling depressed. On that day I lost hope. Anxiety comes back when I get stressed (and I easily do).

When I felt good nothing was different from now (except for all the things I did in between ). I remember that in my childhood I had difficulties feeling part of groups and communicating to other kids. Felt better with my parents. I learnt how to read and write very young. Going to school when I was 5 has been traumatic and at school I had repetitive behaviors like walking in circles, hated to do works like filling shapes with paint and all the kids' stuff. Couldn't sleep far from home (this issue has come back since my mental breakdown). Had many nightmares at home since I startes going to school. Those symptoms disappeared when I grew up.",18Jun2019,2
12,"It’s kinda funny how I can be so apathetic towards death... I got the news that a 7th friend from my childhood died (I’m 23), but honestly I shed a few tears, couldn’t sleep the night and then didn’t even care enough to show up to the funeral. I regret it sometimes but it doesn’t change anything.  It’s odd though I have this desire to be hurt by someone... like raped or killed... I don’t really want it to happen, but it comes back a bit too often. I also I think about dying (nearly every day) usually hanging myself or pulling into another traffic lane, but then I know I would just be disappointed in myself and I think God would too so I don’t. 

my parents have 7 kids, I fall in the middle + foster kids they took in, I saw them come, got attached, then they would leave. I was terrified for 6 years that my brother would be taken away, I used to cry myself to sleep before the adoption papers came through (2015) , but despite so many people being around me, I’ve never felt supported. My siblings tend to gain up on me, I can never say my opinions even on little things without it getting out of hand. For example: I want to make cookies, they want to eat muffins... suddenly they start belittling me because they can’t make their own Damn muffins... sounds petty but it’s not when they start yelling and strip apart everything else I’m doing with my life.
I don’t know why they do it, I’ve never been rebellious or anything, I don’t talk back unless I’m really annoyed... most people say they can’t imagine me angry, I’m trying to do my best in life, Heck! I just spent 19 months doing volunteer work with my church, and another two years away from my family going to school and working and they treat me like a teenager they can just boss around! even my younger siblings join in... sometimes they’re the worst. 
Ya... now that sounded petty 😅

My parents never noticed issues growing up though, they never knew I had anxiety or depression, my siblings were louder so they got the attention. I just stayed quiet and usually shut up in my room. Honestly I didn’t even connect my feelings to anxiety until April 2017 when I began hyperventilating and it lasted over 5 hours... but I hate asking for help, luckily my x (wasn’t my x at the time) was there to drive me home, but upon reviewing things him being there made it worse because I have always dealt with things on my own... when people come near me during these moments I shake more and I can’t breathe... sometimes I worry if it’s for attention, but I’m not sure because I also worry if telling anyone about my friends deaths, or the kids I was attached to, or my sisters accident (kinda my fault) is just using them as sob stories so I don’t try to but when I do talk about them I feel guilty. 
Most recently I had a “friend” that came to help me move into a new place... it was kinda creepy and my roomate wasn’t supposed to come till the next day so I asked if he could just spend the night in my living room cause I’m scared of the dark and again I was getting a bad vibe. He stayed... the issue was he wouldn’t leave... he spent nearly four months there.
At first it was as a friend, my roomate ended up being two weeks late so he said he could just stay until she got there, by that time I was use to seeing him around and he just never left... he began manipulating us both, we never saw each other alone he was always in our shadow, he would ask where I was if I didn’t come home from school on time and who I was with, then he would get mad... he had depression and anxiety as well and would use it against me saying I was awful for abandoning him. If he wasn’t there he had my roomate keep tabs on me. 

When I would go to sleep he would come into my room and tell me he needed me to cuddle with him... sounds weird it was, but to be honest I had just broken up with my x and at first it was my fault... I told him I didn’t like him but we were watching a movie and I asked if I could lean on him, he said he didn’t mind so I did... I did that a few times cause I’m an idiot and then he turned the tables on me and said it was helping him with his anxiety... and I kinda wanted comfort too... but he started trying to be more intimate. I never let him touch me in a romantic way, and I made it clear that I wanted to keep our relationship as a friendship... but he would have a panic attack and ask me to hug him, then he began cuddling more.  It continued and he began coming into my room every night, threatening suicide or to hurt himself or me if I didn’t let him cuddle. I would fight with him and try to make him leave, but he also was manipulating my roomate (but not being physical with her) and they both voted he stay. 

He would tell me how worthless I was constantly. If I was tired from university (I was taking 8 classes at the time... yep😰) and I fell asleep before he came to my room, he would shake me awake and say “we need to talk”, but if I did try talking he would just want me awake to cuddle or swear at... or both... I was exhausted so I told him to leave, he never would.. I got to the point that I would yell at him, he retaliate... (I pity my neighbours 😓) if I tried to tell him we could talk later, he would demand we talk now, if it didn’t end his way he would keep shaking me awake until it did... he literally kept me awake until 6am three times when I had 8am class and couldn’t come home until 11pm because of concerts... I still tried to make him keep his boundaries but one of the times he was keeping me awake and I caved and let him cuddle he put his hand up the back of my shirt, I told him I didn’t like it and he just shrugged and continued, he undid my bra on other occasions, but the worst was when I woke up to him tonguing and licking my cheek... I was so exhausted I just quietly told him to stop and fell back to sleep. ... I know this sounds like I didn’t put up a fight but I was so tired at this point I was falling asleep everywhere, I couldn’t fight back beyond telling him to go away. 

During this time creepy stuff started happening in my house, I would see shadows of people who weren’t there... but I can’t even go into that because it still scares me... during this time I got the same bad vibe feeling at he train station... I soon realized I was being followed, I got my roomate to pick me up, luckily she was fast... it was the worst coming home to that same feeling though...  I’m greatful for prayer it was the only thing that pulled me through. ... but essentially I was at my breaking point... I don’t know how I did it but one day I kicked him out. He was still texting me and my roomate constantly, and would show up at my house when he thought we would be there at the same time... even when we would tell him to go, he was trying to keep us separate. 

You need to understand I didn’t really have anyone in the city to help and I didn’t feel comfortable talking with my family about it... they still don’t know everything... right after I kicked him out some church leaders began noticing things (before we would just act as friends in public) thankfully they took the initiative to come to my house (the one time I was alone) and ask me what was wrong... I couldn’t help crying and telling them... but I felt like I sounded crazy. 
They were amazing in helping me get through the big things, but I still have so much trauma... I haven’t let the “friend” come near me since February and I still wake up with nightmares of him... but still I feel empty and apathetic towards every day living... I want something to happen, something big but I don’t know what... I can’t stand being alone, but I don’t want a psychiatrist I want a real friend or relationship someone who can actually understand me, because I don’t really have anyone that I feel comfortable telling anything to...

13,"I’m not sure why, but my depressions been really kicking it into overdrive the last few weeks. Last week I had a really long and brutal work load that left me completely exhausted. I’ve been feeling so insecure and disappointed with myself. My best friends love and adore me and being around them always makes me feel a lot better but I haven’t really seen them in the last couple of weeks because of our busy schedules.  I was able to meet up with them for dinner tonight and being with them was great but afterwards I just felt even more lonely and depressed.  I just feel like I’m not good for them and that they don’t really like me. (I know it’s not true, but the feeling is so strong it’s overwhelming)

I don’t want to turn my friends into my only coping mechanism, but I also don’t want to further isolate myself.  It’s really hard for me to open up about my feelings and I struggle to trust people so there’s really only a couple people I feel like I could even consider reaching out to. But they’re busy with their own issues and I don’t want to be a burden on them. It’s getting harder and harder for me to hold a conversation because I just keep withdrawing further. 

I don’t know how to get out of this hole I’m digging. My depression hasn’t been this bad in a very long time. I self harmed again for the first time in well over a year. 

I’m just so disappointed in myself and I feel like I shouldn’t be around people because I’ll just bring them down.   I’m scared of trying to reach out I don’t know what to do and I feel myself starting to spiral.",18Jun2019,6
14,"Not sure if it makes sense but I feel like I don’t have the right to feel or react the way I do about some deaths in the past. 
2 years ago I started a new job in a bar and restaurant. 3-4 months in I was supposed to work with a coworker of mine for one of the nights. Someone else was working and he was nowhere to be found. He passed away that morning and that’s how I found out. I’ve only worked about 5-7 shifts with him but even now I feel immensely guilty but at the same time feeling like I don’t deserve to grieve. Like, everyone else can and it makes sense because they knew him for years and hung out outside of work but me? Only a few shifts and only during work. 

Another example is in high school a teacher in the school committed suicide but I was never his student but even now 5 years later I feel guilty for not seeing it coming and also feel like it’s not reasonable to feel this way if he wasn’t even ever my teacher. He was some of my friends’ teacher at one point but never mine....",18Jun2019,5

18,"So this is going to be a long one, I think. I have a father who has some mental health issues I suspect, but has never been diagnosed. Why hasn't he been diagnosed you ask? In his mind he is not the problem, it is everyone else's. Everyone around him is incompetent and if things were done his way the world would be a better place. I think he might have bipolar or borderline personality disorder but i'm no expert. Growing up with a dad like this has not been easy: I've seen him physically harm himself, he's thrown things at me and hit me, and worst of all ruined my self esteem as a teenager by saying fucked up things. In a nutshell he has severe mood swings and irrational anger (something as simple as too much clutter around the house can lead to a rage), seems to think everyone else is the problem and not him, and seems to have trouble maintaining relationships; his brothers don't like him, he has no friends, and from what I can tell very few people at work at like him. I recently moved back in with my family (mom, dad, and brother) and have realized that my dad has gotten much worse. My brother suffers from bipolar disorder and for some reason my dad thinks that my brother can just ""snap out of it"" and that ""if he really wanted to change he would do something about it."" This has led to many fights with my mom and many bouts of rage from my dad. I guess if there's any positive to this situation it's that no matter how mad and rageful my dad gets he he has never gotten physical with my mom. I know this post just seems like a clusterfuck of information but hopefully you were able to get a feel for how my dad is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really have no clue what to do. My mom in the past couple months has mentioned leaving my father, something I never thought she'd do. The only reason she hasn't left him is because she fears he would kill himself and she could never live with herself if that happened. The whole family has told my dad that he needs to get help and nothing has happened. He's seen a therapist a couple times but that's the extent of his treatment. I've tried having a heart to heart with him to express my concern and my true feelings only to be brushed off. 

I guess the reason I'm posting this is because I don't know what the fuck to do. For some reason I still love my dad despite everything. I feel terribly for my mom- I just want her to feel happy. I don't think that's possible unless my dad changes. I feel for my brother. My dad isn't a good role model and isn't very supportive. 

Any advice on how to deal with this situation would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone is doing well and enjoying themselves.",18Jun2019,4
19,"Some background:
I’m a homosexual teenager girl and I’ve been suffering with extreme depression my whole life, and more recently extreme anxiety. Some of the things I’m about to say could just be rational fears for someone of my age group/ sexuality/ gender but I truly think there might be something else there. 

Anyway-
I’ve had the suspicion that there’s something off for a couple of years now, originally thinking that my step dad did something bad to me, but i could never elaborate. I just had a feeling- or i wanted to have that feeling. So for a while now, about 3-4 years, I’ve been having really weird nightmares and I’ve gained some fears I never really used to have. I used to sneak out and take walks at night to ground myself when I was feeling especially depressed or like I wanted to harm myself, which would almost always work. Being surrounded by the dark and the night air was always comforting to me, but in recent years I haven’t even been able to sleep in a room without some sort of small light source for fear of nightmares. 

I’ve also seemed to notice that certain things just set me off. Things like people getting drunk, or people touching my waist without warning. 

I’ve also noticed that people, specifically middle aged white men with beard stubble, scare the fuck out of me. I’m generally fine if I’m around people that fit that description that I know and trust, like one of my band directors, but my other one just- something about him sets me on edge. I never relax around him. I think it might be because his hair is darker??? It seems that it’s also with men with darker hair??

Also specifically the smell of cigarette smoke and body odor together sets off major anxious thoughts and I feel the need to just,, bolt. Even thinking about all this right now is fucking me up. 

I truthfully think that I have a repressed memory of some sort because I’ve been trying to become more self aware over the years and I’m very very aware of these things. I don’t know what’s happening here and I’m kinda afraid to bring it up with my therapist. 

It’s been bothering me more often recently because I keep having this reoccurring nightmare of a man coming out of the dark out of an apartment complex I used to walk by and just chasing me. He always catches up to me and as soon as he does I wake up. 

In the past I put to blame my ex step dad, thinking he did something to me. Well, really hoping he did, hoping I could put a face to something but now I know that that’s just,, not possible. The man hasn’t touched a drink or a cigarette in years and when he did it was never around me so that rules him out. I just hated his existence and wanted it to be him.

I’ve done some research on this topic and I’m not sure if anything about this is true. I know about the power of suggestion and how if I repeat something to myself it can become a false memory. I don’t know if anything truly ever happened at all. All I know is that somethings fucked in my brain and I don’t know if I’m lying to myself or what. Everything is fucked and I’m tired of this shit.

The reason I’m writing about this is because it was about 9:30 at night tonight and just dark out and I decided to take my dog for a walk because he was being a little shit. The instant I stepped outside my fight or flight instincts went off but I kept walking him because he needed to get rid of energy. Not even 5 minutes in I couldn’t take looking over my shoulder anymore and i just fucking booked it home and I’ve been lying on my bathroom floor with the lights on for the past 20 minutes. I don’t know what’s happening. I just need some outside opinions. I’m so fucking tired of this.",18Jun2019,3
20,"Not too sure how to start this out but I have come to the realization that I need help if I am ever to be able to be with someone in a relationship. 

Storytime (short version) I have had anxiety and depression since I was young and have dealt with sexual and emotional abuse for the majority of my life from family. I'm 28 now and cannot seem to connect to people or even attempt to do so without becoming anxious and paranoid and I feel like I am shut down emotionally to others. I dated a very nice guy for a month or two, and we mutually cut it off when I just couldn't reciprocate his need for closeness. Since then we have talked off and on, and though I sincerely really like him (and he still sincerely likes me) I still can't seem to bridge that gap. But I want to try.

So at this time I am unsure of where to start to obtain counseling or therapy services here in good ol' North Carolina. I am scared my already limited finances will take a hit and I am scared that I am somehow broken in a way that cannot be fixed. I have so many questions that I cannot even seem to type out, but if I don't do something about this it seems like a dam might burst and I won't be able to handle the aftermath... Advice of where to start would be helpful. TYVMIA",18Jun2019,2
21,"I'm quite a happy person in general. I deal with anxiety issues, but managed to overcome my depression for the most part. The only thing ruining my life is obsessive thoughts. It's 4:30 in the morning and I've spent all night stalking girls my boyfriend once had a crush on or had a short thing with. On a rational level I'm well aware that this kind of behaviour isn't healthy, that I'm feeding my obsession, but it's slowly becoming a drug. 
My head constructs storylines, that I know aren't true. They make me think that people are never genuine, that there is a conspiracy being played against me. Even typing this makes me feel embarrassed. In the heat of the moment however, when I give into my doubt, tunnel vision takes over and I obsessively look for ways to look into his past, look up the girls, sit and stare at their photos, try to snoop through his stuff. 
I'm embarrassed and it's eating me away. I know it's all fake and made up, but still there's a constant nagging feeling of panic. It become so overwhelming tonight that I had to throw up from all the pressure in my chest. 
My boyfriend is aware of this and he reassures me they are nothing but imagination, something I'm well aware of the majority of the time. 
I'm not sure what to do. The pain becomes a lot, the embarrassment too. I'm scared of it getting out of hand. Of me doing something idiotic in the heat of the moment.",18Jun2019,2
22,"I worry a lot that the ""panic attacks"" I have been experiencing for the past 1.5 years are not actually panic attacks. I don't hyperventilate, my heart doesn't always beat super fast, and it never lasts for only the 5-15 minutes they are usually described as lasting. Instead, it's mostly internal and you wouldn't be able to tell I was having one if you were right in front of me except for the fact I get really quiet. I get an intense fear of something being wrong, I often feel off balance or a little dizzy and sometimes have to grasp on to something, sometimes it's hard for me to speak. I can't really describe what they are like in a way that does it justice, actually. Also, they never happen because something bad happens. They are completely random. The first time I had a panic attack, I didn't know what was happening and went to an emergency psych appointment at my college. The counselor wasn't even convinced I was having a panic attack and thought it was an actual health emergency and almost called 911. I have since been diagnosed with panic disorder but I have never felt confident that I am actually experiencing panic attacks.

26,"I am an emotional wreck right now. So, things have been rough. I posted here some time ago on my main account,  but I deleted the post after getting advice. I was scared to keep the post up, afraid it would be found. This is a throwaway.

I have finally come to terms with the fact that what's going on here is abuse. I am 22, disabled, and trying to get through college. I am currently on a break because I am trying to catch up my tuition fees. Because of this, I am at home with my brother and my mother.

I love them dearly. However, they are constantly yelling at me, constantly berating me, telling me that everything I do is wrong. They constantly make it so that my opinions don't matter. I can't get through one day without arguing with them. They threaten me. (ex. ""if you don't come to this outing with me, you aren't eating today.)  They don't respect me, my Mom has untrained my service dog and every time I complain, she brushes me off. 

Recently, Mom has gotten involved in religion. It's become a regular thing that I am now locked in the car and forced to endure lectures about Jesus and being a good Christian. I am Atheist. This all reached a head when I reminded her of this yesterday. She said ""You are not an Atheist and if you ever say that again, I will slap you.""

I've been making excuses for so long, but they mark every single box for emotional abuse. I didn't want to admit that because I love them. Even now, I find it hard. They give me a home and they feed and clothe me, even pay for college, how can they be abusive? But I think I have to accept that it is now.

I'm so sad all the time now, my mind is constantly in a bad place. I don't know how to cope right now. It just feels like thousands of voices screaming in my head all day long, every day, and even anonymously posting things like this hurts so much, I feel so much illogical guilt and I don't understand why.

I do have a plan to get out. It won't be immediately, it's going to take some time, a long time, hopefully by September, but I don't need advice there.

29,"I'm a sophmore in highschool, and a bit on the heavy side. Overweight for people born with feminine genitals that are 15 and 5 foot 5.5 (they/them pronouns plz n thank you)

Now, I have depression and it has taken me so long to learn to love myself. I dont care how I look, whether im overweight or not, so long as Im happy with who I am and how I look, which I do. 

A couple days ago, i was sitting o  the couch, just after dinner and a shower, and my grandma, sat on the other couch, looks at me and says ""you and your mom should go for a walk."" 

She said this with no context, nothing asking for her input. It's not like my mom or I were sat there like ""huh. I want to do something but i dont know what."" 

So I ask her why and she goes ""Because you dont do anything. You just sit there on your phone or in your room, eating."" 

I'm summer vacation. Of course im going to be lazy. I worked my ass off for 9 months for teachers that dont care about me. 

Anyways. So I ro my eyes, just dismissing her insult, and text my best friend. My best friend (Fox) doesnt like my grandma, and I always go to Fox when something upsets me. 

Fox goes on a rant about how my grandmother needs to mind her own business and stop talking about my weight. 

Today, my grandma, mother, brother and I go to the mall. We're dillards, my grandmother looking for shoes. The rest of us get bored just standing around, so we start to walk around and look at stuff. 

I soon find the dress section, and since I'm trying to feel more comfortable with myself and get out of my comfort zone, I startbto look for a dress. I find some I like, but theyre too expensive, so we move on. 

As we're leaving Dillard's, my mom sees a really nice maroon dress on a mannequin. She points at the dress and comments about how cute it is. I agree with her, because tbh it was absolutely gorgeous. Neither of us said anything about me wearing it or even owning it and my grandmother was not a part of this conversation whats so ever. But she walks up behind us just as the conversation abour the dress is ending. 

With no prompting, not a single ""Mom/Grandma, what do you think?"" she goes:

""Yeah, maybe if OP was skinnier."" 

I was in a good mood, all smiley and everything. As soon as she said this, my whole attitude shifted. I was PISSED! 

My grandmother knows about my struggle with my self-image, always poking her nose in my business whenever my mother has to take me to see my doctors. And yet she has the nerve to keep bringing up my weight, without any reason. 

I text Fox again, because im extremely angry, and I need someone to help calm myself down. 

Fox goes an her tangent again, and this time I give her permission to cuss out my grandmother if she does anything of similarity while Fox is visiting.

After calming myself down, the group is walking theough the mall, heading for the play area since my brother is becoming annoying and needs to be worn out. We pass by a Bath &amp; Body Works and my grandmother says that she's going inside and that she'll meet us at the play area. She then turns to me and asks if I'll go with her. 

I, of course, refuse since I'm still upset with her. She looks at me, confused and hurt, and I just keep walking with my mother. 

I know, I shouldnt be as upset as I am with my grandmother, but she has absolutely no right to intrude on my personal business and say such insulting things about how I look.  

I also know that this occurance will not be the last. And I refuse to let it effect my mental health. I will NOT let some crusty person affect how I look at myself and feel about myself.",18Jun2019,8

We have been going out for almost a year now, July 8th being our one year and throughout it I have been there for her in every way imaginable being emotionally available cutting people out of my life whenever she felt insecure about them, calling off work a few times due to how badly she was spiraling. She deals with major depression and anxiety and has self diagnosed herself with autism. She has had a real bad childhood due to many different traumas stemming from sexual and mental abuse all leading up into her teens where she would experience the worst of it getting into a log distance relationship for 5 years with someone who was nothing short of an asshole and just terrible to her. Fast forward to the end of that relationship is when we met thru tinder. Over time she opened up to me about everything that he happened to her and I promised her I would stick with her through everything and so far I have but it has taken a toll I thought it never would on me, myself not being too mentally stable either. I am breaking down at the time of writing this and have no one else I feel I can talk to so here I am. We fight off and on and have had disagreements throughout the relationship and they may not have been dealt in the best way possible, all of them ending with us breaking down and promising to stay with each other. But all of them have just taken a toll on me and sometimes she relives her traumatic moments and instead of seeing me for me, she sees everyone else and it never fails so I end up getting jabbed at so much and I just hold so much in because I don’t want to resemble any of the people that have hurt her but I worry me doing that and just holding so much in for so long is tearing me apart inside and I noticed a feeling of emotional unavailability in the last couple of days where she has just kind of been in bed and feeling dangerously suicidal and hopeless. And part of me just want to call it quits but with all the facts and her home life, she is one inevitably going to kill herself if we call it quits, or sooner and in a sadder state than thought. I guess in this huge ass info dump I’m trying to seek answers because I feel alone and the one friend I would talk to about all of this has been cut off due to insecurities. And I deeply feel for her and everything she has gone thru and I just want the best for her and to see her happy and maybe I’m just too much of a coward to really truly make a difference or not break my promise to her that I would stay with her because besides me she literally has one friend and she lives in another country. Our highs are insanely high and our lows are heart wrenching lows and I fear that the lows are becoming increasingly more and more painful And more frequent. She is such a bright damn light and i do genuinely feel that we were meant for each other in our perception of the world and just our personalities as a whole. I love her so much and she isn’t a terrible person I feel, she has just been wronged so much I feel she is so deep in it that she can’t see a way out and she thought that maybe this relationship might be that but she may be realizing now that not even this can help wholly.

33,"**tldr: My psych has me taking four different prescription medications for various reasons and I am concerned. Do I have reason to be nervous about this?**

Sorry if this doesn't belong here, but I'm hoping someone might have some insight.

Background: 

I have only ever seen one doctor because the first one I went to I meshed really well with (we will call her Dr. C for the sake of brevity).

I struggled with depression and anxiety for several years before I sought help, and even then it was only because my then-boyfriend basically forced me to, as it was severely negatively affecting our relationship. Before seeing Dr. C, I had moderate depression and severe anxiety, I could barely eat, as I have a choking phobia and would have panic attacks when eating.

When I began seeing her, she diagnosed me with depression (moderate) and panic disorder. She also believed that I had some PTSD from growing up in an emotionally abusive household with an alcoholic mother. We started therapy and she decided to put me on sertaline. I was feeling a lot better and a ton less anxious. 

After a year or so of seeing Dr. C every two weeks and seeing a lot of improvement, I ran into some financial trouble and dropped off the map. I went off of my meds. At that point I was taking 100 mg of sertraline/day, and I had a prescription for lorazepam as needed, which was to manage panic attacks if they occurred (I took it very sparingly, the sertraline brought my panic attacks down from daily to monthly.)

I did well for about eight months (or so I thought, I don't think I was actually doing that well in hindsight). Last summer I hit rock bottom. Though I didn't feel depressed or anxious much, I was drinking heavily (which is likely the reason for the lack of anxiety, yay for self-medicating). I have a habit of not eating much, I've never had a big appetite and I don't really enjoy food, plus the whole choking phobia. Basically I just don't take care of myself in general. 

One day after drinking heavily the day before and not eating for about 48 hours, I took my dogs for a walk. I started to feel really faint and knew I was going to pass out. My boyfriend was about 200 yards away talking with the neighbors, and I wanted to call out to him that I needed help but I couldn't speak. I sat down and tried to breathe between my legs and calm down enough to walk home. I got up after a few minutes and began to walk. After about 30 feet, I collapsed, slammed my head on the concrete and gave myself a nasty concussion. After seeing me collapse and having the fright of his life, my boyfriend told me I needed to go back to my psychiatrist and sort myself out, as well as stop drinking. I agreed.

I made an appointment with Dr. C for a couple days out. At this point I hadn't gone to a hospital for my concussion (didn't even know it was a concussion). Dr. C freaked out when I came in and she saw my messed up head. I told her the above story and how I had been abusing alcohol and she did some tests and said I most likely had a moderate to severe concussion, and that she wanted me to start taking an anti-epileptic immediately because my concussion combined with my withdrawal from alcohol made it highly likely that I would have seizures. I started taking 300 mg of gabapentin twice/day. I also restarted my sertaline at 25 mg/day to start.

I began seeing her regularly every two weeks. After a month or so, she took me off of the gabapentin because my seizure risk decreased. We upped the sertaline every month or so until I was back at the old dose of 100 mg/day. However, after stopping the gabapentin I had severe insomnia, which is something that I've struggled with before, but the alcohol helped with. Since I wasn't drinking anymore, it came back. Dr. C suggested that I take the gabapentin again, because I didn't seem to have insomnia when I was on it. And it worked! So we decided to keep me on the gabapentin for the interim to control that.

My anxiety and depression had returned with a vengeance, and the sertaline wasn't working as well as it had been before I stopped taking it. Dr. C suspected that since I was combining it with alcohol before that it was probably reacting differently with me now. I started taking lamotrigine as she said that it can help decrease anxiety/depression with people on SSRIs. I started at 20 mg/day and slowly upped it until I was taking 150 mg/day.

At this point I was still having panic attacks a lot of the time. I was taking lorazepam almost daily to deal with that. After starting the lamotrigine, most of this went away.

So for about six months I was taking these medications daily: 100mg sertraline, 100mg lamotrigine, 600mg gabapentin. Very occasionally (about once a month) I took 1mg lorazepam. 

For the most part I was doing okay, struggling a little here and there, but not bad. I saw Dr. C every other week, and eventually every other month when I seemed to be getting better.

Around May of this year I started getting worse. I had always struggled with having night sweats from the sertraline, but for whatever reason it had become more frequent. I'm talking waking up in the morning with so much sweat it was like someone had poured a bucket of water on me. Sheets soaking. This happened several times a week. Dr. C decided to taper down the sertaline to see if that would help while still controlling the other symptoms. We went down to 75mg and it didn't get better, so we went down to 50mg. 

Early this month my anxiety became out of control. This was about 6 weeks after lowering the sertaline to 50mg. I was really stressed out from school which I'm sure didn't help, but I was a fucking mess. Crying for no reason, panic attacks daily, you get the picture. I called her between sessions and told her I couldn't cope. She said to up the sertaline to 75 again until our next session, and to call her and get an appointment ASAP if anything got worse. I seemed to get a little better so I kept my original appointment and went to see her last week.

We decided to stop the sertaline, as it wasn't controlling my issues at the lower dose and it was causing too many side effects at the higher dose. She switched me to escitalopram instead. At the same time, she prescribe me adderall. I was having sleep-attacks (falling asleep randomly, a symptom of narcolepsy), and had a lot of troubling focusing on my schoolwork which was making my grades decline. She wants to wean my off of lamotrigine as well, but wants to wait until the other medications settle. She asked me to go get some bloodwork done to test my thyroid and a couple of other things to see if anything could be causing some of the issues.

We also went over the depression/anxiety/focus tests because we hadn't done them in awhile, and despite the fact that I feel less depressed than I have in a long time, according to my answers I'm categorized as having major depressive disorder, which is a step up from the moderate depression I had before. 

So at the moment, the medications I am taking are:

* 10 mg escitalopram daily (SSRI)
* 600 mg gabapentin daily (anti-epileptic, using for sedative purposes)
* 150 mg lamotrigine daily (anti-epileptic, using to boost the SSRI)
* norethindrone (birth control)
* 10 mg adderall daily (stimulant, for focus and fatigue)
* 5000 mcg vitamin b-12 daily (for fatigue)
* lorazepam as needed (for anxiety, I rarely take it)

All of these were prescribed by her apart from the birth control. Maybe I'm overthinking it, but every time I go to take my pills it just feels like so much. I do feel much better than I have in a long time. I've had some major stressors in my life in the last few weeks, so I am definitely feeling a bit down, but I'm not much worse than my usual base level (which, granted, is a lot lower than other people's). If it is helping me achieve this level of good mental health, then I think it's worth it. It just worries me to be taking this much medication. I'm not against medication at all, and I definitely need some medication to function at this point in my life, but again, it feels like a lot. Anytime we add or discontinue a medication she asks if I'm okay with it or what my thoughts are, but I always defer to her as she obviously knows a hell of a lot more about it than I do. 

We will be discontinuing the lamotrigine soon, and I believe we will be discontinuing the gabapetin when we're done with that, provided I'm not spiraling downwards again. That would bring the medication back down to a reasonable number. I just can't help but feel anxious about it, and this anxiety isn't just made up in my head as most of them are.

I do want to add that I am still doing therapy sessions with her, as well as practicing mindfulness and meditation. She pushes me to go to support groups like al-anon, or to AA itself since I am considered a recovering alcoholic. So it's not just all medication, we are working on other ways to cope.

Am I overreacting, or is this unusual?

35,"It was one of those ""decades happening in months"" kind of years. I've had a really hard time settling back into my old job. I still get a ""flight"" response to specific kinds of work and requests.

This is stacked on lifelong procrastination issues around office work. I consistently got raises and positive feedback working physical labor jobs, but office work was always a circus of me only able to work on it once under sufficient pressure to engage in it. Had that issue since I was a kid, couldn't do anything mentally tedious until after midnight, but had no hesitation if it was physical labor. I've never understood this, but the problem is now more difficult than ever.

I've tried everything from herbal anxiety supplements, to Lithium. Nothing seems to be doing the trick. I'm walking laps around the campus every few hours pounding energy drinks way more than usual, but I'm finally hitting some kind of breaking point with combined distractability and anxiety.

39,"I had a pretty severe depressive episode about 2 years ago and was prescribed Seroquel to deal with insomnia. I only took it a few times, I never really like it because I felt like I was coming out of a coma when waking up the next mourning.  It made me very drowsy, part of that was also because I was smoking weed heavily.

So I stop taking the pills but still kept them. Fast forward to January this year I decided to stop smoking marijuana (ive been smoking almost everyday for the past 10 years) and I thought taking Seroquel would help me quit. 

Lets say I was wrong. My 1st sober day went fine but i knew there was no way I would sleep so I took 2 25mg pills. I will never forget the next day it was a nightmare. Everybody at work knew there was something wrong with me, my boss asked me if I was on drugs. I was not only drowsy but emotionless. That same day I threw away the remaining pills.

The very next day I went back to smoking marijuana daily. I thought everything would go back to normal but I have to say that 6 months later it has not. I still feel very empty and disconnected of my emotions. The worst part is my sexual drive is completely gone.

44,"I’ve struggled with my mental health for almost 10 years now, and for me when my mental health is suffering, so does my living space. And that just leads into a vicious cycle of being depressed that I’m living in a shithole but not having the energy to do anything about it.  Over the years I’ve learned a few tricks that help me and I thought I’d share. 

1.) Buy a lot of trash bins. I like to have at least one in every room of the house, sometimes two if it’s a big room. When I’m very depressed walking an extra 4 feet could be too much effort,  and the trash would end up on the floor. More bins= less mess to clean up when I’m feeling well again. 

2.) Paper plates. Seriously a life saver. Saves on dishes. I try not to use plastic cutlery if I can avoid it, but if the depression spell is lasting long I’ll use them to cut down on dishes piling in the sink. 

3.) Multiple storage bins for the same category of stuff. 3 different bins for craft stuff, electronics, office supplies, etc in separate rooms. This way if I’m trying to clean up but don’t have the energy to bring an object from one room in the house to the other, I have a bin where it can belong. 

4.) Self Cleaning vacuums are a godsend. 

5.) Lysol cleaning wipes everywhere. One in the kitchen, bathroom, and living area. If the cleaning thing is right there, it’s easier to motivate myself to do it. 


Do you guys have any other tips! If you do please share them ❤️❤️❤️",18Jun2019,7
45,"I'm 16m and I have really bad social anxiety. About 6 months ago I was broken up from my girlfriend of about 3 months. I liked her, she never said a mean thing to me and was extremely thoughtful of my mental health. Overall, a really good girl. That being said, everytime I saw her or texted her I just felt so uncomfortable. I felt happy to have her, my family talked about how much nicer I was and I was more confident than I had ever been in my entire life. That being said, it was stressful. I figured I'll just wait and it'll get easier, but nope, 3 months in I was still extremely uncomfortable talking to her. Also, I met a few of her friends and that just added to the discomfort (most of time I just wouldn't talk, once I really wanted to but I couldn't get the words out so I litterally just left so no one would see me cry because I was so frustrated). 3 months of talking to my gf every day and hanging out with one or more of her friends every 2 or 3 days and it never got better. Now I just have no desire to even be in a relationship. I feel like I'll never be comfortable enough around a person to be able to be friendly  with them. Hell, I'm even uncomfortable around my own siblings and parents, which is why I sit in my room 90% of the time. Its just close relationships, I can go in public to the store alone and I do it all the time, but forming relationships is just impossible for me.

I feel like social media is horrible for mental healthy because you are seeing all these fake lives and happy faces, making us feel bad about ourselves by comparison. However, in the same way, when I walk through a crowd of people and see everyone with their friends hanging out I can’t help but feel like an outsider and lonely. I’m not a lonely guy in general, I have a good amount of friends, both close friends and not so close. It becomes difficult when I am somewhere like the library at university and see everyone around with their friends studying but I’m studying alone. I know this is a bad mindset and I appreciate that it’s great to be alone sometimes (especially to study) but is this normal to feel? Could there be something I can do to reduce this feeling?",18Jun2019,26

58,"I tell big lies that will only hurt me. I often tell them to feel better about myself or just to contribute to the conversation. But I mainly lie to avoid any feeling of judgement. I am also scared that people will bully me again or not accept me for who I am. I have not told my psychiatrist any of this stuff and am not sure how to.

My first big lie was when I liked about my smoking habits when many of my friends started smoking. Since, then I have lied about doing more serious drugs. I have only told this more serious lie to my roommates who tried to pressure me into doing drugs and drinking. 

However, it doesn't end there. I have always had issues with holding a job due to my anxiety and this is a cause of a lot of anguish. For example, I often have lied about getting certain internships or working part time jobs. I usually only tell these lies if someone starts bragging to me about their internships. Though, it is still a stupid thing to lie about as. My stories are often really elaborate and I will double down on most of my lies. 

I have also lied about where I live and who my dad is. I tend to be honest about my interests but I always keep people an arms distance away. I also don't feel bad about lying until I am caught. I have come to despise this side of myself over the years.

I've been at uni for a long time and for the past 2 years have been barely able to scrape by because study triggers my anxiety so badly.

I have one more exam left until the end of S1 (here in australia). Should I take off semester 2 and commit to therapy etc so that I can have a long time to get better?

66,"Three days ago, the unusually warm spring sun shone down upon the side of my face, as I inhaled a long drag of my cigarette I overlooked the edge of the cliff, and listened to the sound of the still waves and everything seemed calm, I seemed to be at peace.

Although I knew all too well that in five minutes time, once the cigarette end burnt the edge of my fingers, and the taste of burning settled in my mouth, my reality would return.

It’s 2019 and I’m contemplating throwing myself off the side of the cliff, but not before I finish my last cigarette.

How did I end up here? 

Fourteen years old. Summer in the south of England. 
The transition from innocent child to troubled teenager was beginning. 

I grew up with a loving family in a small seaside town and life was good, and for me, easy. I always had a roof over my head, with a full plate of food each night until.. 

My first cigarette, my first beer, my first blackout. 

School was difficult for me, not because I didn’t learn as quickly as others, but because I was the one with unused potential. In between getting a five finger discount at fourteen years old from the local supermarket during lunch hours and bunking off school, I hardly applied myself in the lessons and just glided my way through thinking all would be OK in the end.

I’ve spent the majority of my life gliding, being average, never pushing myself and this eventually turned into self-hatred. I didn’t think I was worth anything, I still don’t think I am worth anything and as I write this I’m trying to find out how I’m supposed to start.

I’ve piled on weight and been unable to shake off smoking. Continuously struggling with it since I was fourteen or fifteen - almost a visual representation of my own self-hatred and I don’t love myself enough to fix it.

I think perhaps I’ve struggled with mental health but have been too ignorant or arrogant to notice and realise and in the last few months I think it’s come to real fruition. My relationship has broken down, the house we bought is up for sale and I’m moving back in with my parents, if my life wasn’t messy enough to begin with, it really is in the gutter now. I have days where I’m ok, but never days that are great. Most days are bad, like a real thick fog covers my entire mind and I can’t break through and see the sunlight. It’s in these days (or weeks) that I feel really vulnerable and weak. Like I don’t deserve to be anything other than this mediocre, fat, unhealthy lump that doesn’t really see any way forward. I can’t imagine what my life is going to be five or ten years from now, other than exactly the same as it is right now. So what’s the point?

I’m not looking for any sympathy. I just needed to write it down to get this out of my mind, to try and clear some space.",18Jun2019,1

I can’t control my behavior and even though I’ve been struggling to feel more positive, it doesn’t work out. I unsuccessfully committed suicide 3 months ago and even though everyone knew about my problems, they doesn’t seem to care. I always see myself as a selfish, ugly and useless kid. People continuously tell me to “be more positive” but it’s not that easy for me. I can’t go to the psychologist on my own since I’m to young and there’s no one I can rely on right now.

it’s summer now. i’m supposed to be having the time of my life, but i’m not. i feel like everyone has forgot about me. no one hits me up to hang out, no one texts me, i’m just so alone. i get so sad seeing all of my friends hanging out on social media and i’m just in my room, alone.

along with this i just think my friends don’t like me. all i do is vent to them when we rarely text and i feel like just no one cares about me i’m just so alone right now. i don’t know if they even care about me or it’s my dumb mind telling me this but it’s so hard to know.

along with this, i was in a relationship with this girl about a month ago. we were friends for a bit and both liked each other. we would get coffee and id come to her house and we would just chill. it made me so happy. she left to go on vacation for a little over a month, and i couldn’t wait to see her; she made me just want to keep going. i was about to see a movie when i got a text from one our mutual friends. she said that the girl i was with didn’t love me anymore, and didn’t want to be with me, but also didn’t want to tell me. i was crushed. the one thing that brought me happiness just threw me away. i still am having a hard time from that.

Is there a way for me to keep going to therapy and to keep my medications? I don't have healthcare and both of my parents refuse to even get it. At the very least I do have a job. I work 40-45 hours a week and I get paid $12 dollars an hour.

 Is there any way that I can apply for healthcare? I'm 17 and I live in New Mexico, I can't find anything that tells me that I can. My current plan is too discuss this with my therapist and hope that she's understanding of this situation. With my luck, I'll still be able to see her. However, as of right now, she's considering sending me to see another psychiatrist for my visual and auditory hallucinations. But if my mom refuses to take me, I don't know what I'll do. I'm just so terrified for the future. Being in this house is killing me so much, I can't stop crying and I can't stop rocking. I can't sleep. I've only been off my medications for two days and I'm losing my mind so badly. I'm scared. I just want to sleep again.

\- Deeper voice: I had a really abusive stressful environment at young, 27 now and this contributed to having a high pitched voice. I don't have much confidence in it helping me get a deeper voice as a result from the trauma.

But i don't know why i'm always in this depression abyss. I don't have a valid reason to be sad. I don't judge others when they're sad because whatever they're going through and feeling is valid but when it comes to myself i feel like a worthless goner. I've been blessed enough to have food on my table and a roof over my head and i still feel sad. The voices in my head are screaming at me that i'm just faking everything to get attention and that i'm a bad person. And sometimes i can't take it.

75,"I am very competitive in life. I want to be the best of not just myself but the people around me. This also causes me to depressed and sometimes leads to suicidal thoughts. 

I can start of by saying that I have BDD. In the past year I thought about how my body looks and it made me really sad. There is nothing I can do to change it. Working out will make me stronger but it’s not the body I want.

The depression/insecurity also made playing sports difficult. I haven’t really played sports for a very long time and I’m not motivated to. It makes me feel weak because I’m not athletic anymore. This causes me to be more depressed.

I just finished my sophomore year and I passed all my classes, but my grades are terrible. I have no motivation to do work in school and it makes everything so hard. My psat score was below average. I didn’t really try on it but now I feel like even if I did try, I would only get above average. That’s not enough for me, especially for someone who is so competitive. There were people who got good almost perfect scores and it made me jealous.   

Basically, what I want in life is to be more attractive, more athletic, and more smarter. It’s impossible to change my appearance so I can’t do anything about it. And I don’t know how athletic or smart I can potentially be. I don’t even want to try because of my depression/insecurities.

78,"I’ve been looking to get a better job since January and, whilst I’ve been fortunate enough to be offered several interviews, I’m yet to receive an offer. In some instances, feedback hasn’t been forthcoming. At other times, it’s been disheartening with reasons such as ‘we don’t feel like you’d fit into our team’ or ‘we don’t think you’d stay for long due to the commute’ having left me feeling helpless.

I’ve suffered from depression for several years and this has left me feeling like I’m spiralling into its very worst depths. My wife and I have two children and, financially, it’s getting harder by the day. I really enjoy spending time with my family, but this just isn’t enough to make me feel like life is worth living at the moment. I’m not only struggling financially, but dislike my current job too. It’s unfulfilling and I’ve only had one annual review in ten years. I’ve been here for this long because, ultimately, after failing at an interview, I’ve felt deflated and have needed several months to recover. I’ve sustained my efforts this time as my family’s wellbeing is a great motivator, but I frequently find myself asking what the point of it all is if I’m unhappy for, say, 75% of the time. I won’t commit suicide because I’m terrified of how it would affect my family, but getting out of bed, going to work, ploughing through tasks that don’t matter – it’s all so bloody hard!

Has anyone else had a similar experience? Did anything help you? I’m always looking for ways to make myself more employable – the main hurdles are financial, however, as I cannot afford further training at the moment and my current employer have no CPD/training on offer.

I’ve had moments in my life of not trusting my own family. When I was little I refused to eat cause I thought somebody I knew was putting poison in my food.

81,"This is something I've been feeling since I was a kid (like 15 years ago), whenever there was something going on, for example, a school field trip, even before the whole trip started I felt like there's a lump in my throat and I wanted to throw up. I couldn't speak, and thought it was just car sickness.

It stopped when I went to high school, then college, then came back when I was studying for my board exam two years ago. I mistook as something that would go away, or maybe I drank too much coffee so I was just having hyperacidity. When I took the board exam for two days, I wanted to throw up, so I did, but nothing came out. Again, I thought it is normal for someone who is having an exam, just nervous because it is a big one.

Passed the board exam, I went to apply for a professional id, and there it was again. I felt horrible. My stomach was okay, but the lump in my throat was bothering me again. I wanted to throw up in the middle of the licensing office, even though there was nothing to worry about. There was no exam, just submitting papers and nothing more. Happened again when I took the oath. It was hard, I had my mouth shut because I was afraid I might gag any time.

In my first job, I was required to go outside for site visit with my superiors. When we were in a restaurant for lunch, it came back again. I couldn't eat and speak. I was hungry but I chose to eat a burger that I didn't even finish because I wanted to throw up. It continued and continued every time we went outside, and told my superiors that I just don't eat when I'm on a trip.

This feeling is now bothering me. There are lots of things I wanted to do, but can't because of it. Even for simple events like going to work and talking to my officemates is making me want to throw up. In my mom's birthday last week I wanted to throw up and I don't even know why. I want to apply for a teaching job, but I'm scared that during my demo I accidentally gag and I don't want that to happen.

Is this requires a professional help?

So around November 2015 I fell into a major depressive episode and couldn’t get out of it until December 2016. It’s kind of odd to say, but during that year, I felt more at peace with myself than I had ever been. 

I didn’t care what people thought of me. I didn’t mind that I was a piece of shit who did nothing but sleep, wake up, do work at the bare minimum, &amp; ate a small meal a day, sometimes every 2-3 days. 

I just didn’t care about anything, and I found genuine comfort in that. It’s like an invincible shield that protects you from any emotional damage that’s coming from an external source. Not only that, but it was a lot easier to just drift away &amp; kinda forget that I was alive for a few hours. God I miss that shit.

We are faced with astronomical bills if we want to excel in something because we have to pay to get our grades

We are told by the doctors to administer self care but in today's society self care is shutting yourself away from the world and hoping it just passes you by.

Personally I've been in the shit a few times and luckily I've had family and friends to turn to, some people arent able to do this and people lose loved ones because of this.

I wish there were future for our children or our children's children and only we can make this possible by making the world aware that mental health problems are an illness that need to be treated.

85,"[United States] Hello all! I'm hoping to have a bit of a discussion here about my mom, how much she loathes the evidence of my battle with depression, and maybe someone else will have shared experience to offer. 


Long story short, I've been depressed for all of my adult life, starting at puberty. I started self-harming in middle school and I still have the scars to show for it. My parents are of the generational belief that mental illness is not real and people suffering from depression or anxiety need to just buck up or grow up and deal with it. So when my mom found one of my journals in middle school detailing my innermost thoughts, feelings, demons, and statement of active self harming, her first instinct was to beat my ass until I cried. Not even a conversation about it. Just a belt and my tears.


All through undergrad I exhibited typical BPD symptoms but never realized what I was doing was misguided. Binge drinking, binge sex, drugs, smoking, slipping grades. Upon moving back home I found myself in the middle of my parents' extremely messy divorce and I wound up emaciated, barely able to leave my bed bc I was so depressed. This depression lingered well into my MS degree the following year, causing more reckless behavior with 0 regard for consequences. I mean, strangers were cleaning up my alcohol poisoning puke and dropping me off at my apartment it was a mess. It all culminated into some pretty serious self-harm and terrifying battles with the temptation to end my own life. Evidently I did not and I am proud of myself. But once my mom saw my cuts and cigarette burns, she lost it and started telling her family and friends how disgusting and sick and twisted her daughter was. I only know this because I overheard the conversations. I kept it to myself bc I was so heartbroken but quietly chose to distance myself from this woman who verbally disowned me when I needed her most. This was around Christmas 2018. 


Fast forward to a week ago and I finally told her the toll her words had taken on my self worth. She did not apologize or express any sort of remorse for her judgement, short-sightedness, or unwillingness to sympathize. ""It was a private conversation idk what you want me to say."" And I was heartbroken all over again. So now I am doing much better. I went from being severely underweight, afraid of food, living off caffeine, nicotine, and hatred to working out daily, spending time outside and getting As in my courses. I am proud of myself. But how can I move on or accept this mindset from the woman who gave me life? Is this evidence of a deeper toxicity that i should distance myself from or is she really just that ignorant?


TLDR: mother admitted she thinks my self harm scars are disgusting and i'm heartbroken that she is so appalled by me. what do?",18Jun2019,1
86,"First off, a little background. I've been a music student for 5 years now and just finished my Bachelor's degree in composition this week. These last weeks I've been super stressed to finish my last papers to not have to do another semester to finish the degree (I already did 1 extra year).   
I managed to finish everything and I thought the stress would go down and I would feel more at ease and less tense and enjoy my life more. Right now though, the only thing I can think about is how I'm gonna manage to create great music, It's all I think about and it stresses me the fuck out. I'm angry when having to relate to anything else (for instance if a friend calls me and asks me to hang out), the only thing I want to be doing is to sit at home and create/compose music on my computer. This would be great if I enjoyed it, but it makes me really stressed out, angry, anxious and restless. For the most part, I'm just like paralyzed, not able to write anything, angry because I'm not able to create anything good, and I sit there just going over and over inside my head how I'm going to create something good.  


I'm now seeing a therapist and last time we met we started talking about why I have this crazy drive to do something great, 'cause it's been with me all my life. I've always focused like super hard on one thing, wanting to be really great at it, but now it has come to the point where I'm not able to function very well socially ('cause I feel angry when I have to stop thinking about music, and as a result I'm so disconnected from everything else), and I'm not even able to create any good music; for the most part I'm just sitting there frustrated and the process is just painful and I'm not able to enjoy creating at all. I think I do want to enjoy creating though, being swept along the process and taking that journey of discovering along the creative process, but as of now it stresses me the fuck out and ruins other areas of my life.   


So, does anybody have anything to say about this? Maybe you've been through something similar? I really want to move beyond this crazy drive/obsession/major pressure that I'm putting on myself, and let more go of it so I can relax and enjoy my life and relationships with people and the actual creative process, but I'm kind of at loss at how to do so. It seems I'm either in this huge stress, or really depressed and apathetic to avoid having to relate to the stress.

88,"Hello everyone.

I am writing this, because I'm concerned for my friend. She is a 18 year old female. Form the outside perspective there is nothing wrong with her. However if you look ""under the hood"" it's easy to understand that she has some issues. 

I've known her for a couple of months now and spent with her quite a lot of time. Now I want to adress the fact that I am no expert, however I seem to have a natural born talent for people. I am skillful at recognizing small clues in people's behaviors and see their emotions. Still I don't have a PhD so take everything that I am saying here with a grain of salt. 

Let's call my friend Bonnie from now on. So Bonnie is a quite smart and outgoing girl. She gets plenty of good grades, has some friends and goes to a lot of parties. She is quite attractive, for some she may be even intimidating, taking the fact that she seems pretty confident. 

Now with the introduction out of the way I would like to get to the meat of it. Bonnie, like I said before likes to party and she is the type to do one vodka shot after another. On those parties a lot of guys hit her up. She flirts for a while and after that she ignores the guy or leads him on as if she was interested and then crashes his hopes of a relationship with her. She acknowledged herself that this isn't the nicest thing and would like to stop this, but she just can't.

Bonnie told me that she has never loved anyone.  She says that it's actually good, because she never had to experience a heartbreak and never had to limit her freedom for another person. She also mentioned that she does feel attraction and lust towards guys, but never love. 

I think that her family history has to do something with that. Her grandfather cheated on his wife and left her grandmother. Another inportant fact is that Bonnie herself comes from a broken family. The history repeated and her father cheated on her mother. During the marrige he blamed her mother for all the problems between them. He was also very harsh and demanding towards Bonnie's education. I suspect that he never showed her love and care.

I think that all that lead to the fact that now Bonnie has hid her feelings deep down. She is afraid to be intimate with somebody. I think that unconsciously she is scared of somebody doing her what her father did to her mother. 

What do you think about this situation? Is there anyway I can help her?",18Jun2019,1
89,"First off, I’m sorry for any language mistakes. English isn’t my first language. Uhmm so where do I start. I’m constantly in a state of I don’t really care anymore or in a state of  mental anguish. I can go from not feeling anything to feeling like I want to cry most of the times. I don’t really leave the house anymore, because every time I leave the house it's like the thoughts in my head keep breaking me down. Telling me how worthless everything is and how I’ll never amount to anything. Even though I know deep down that I’m not what these thoughts say that I am. I’ve been self harming since the age of I think 11 or 12 (24 years old now) and have thought and planned to commit suicide, but not just just yet. I’ve stopped self harming for about 1 year now, but I still get the urge to do so. I usually drink alcohol to make me forget and to prevent that I hurt myself. I’ve got a brother and mother that are in another country so I’d rather not bother them, because both of them have it hard at the moment. I’m living with my dad, and my dad probably has a mental problem. A few weeks ago he broke down mentally and started to harm himself, breaking the apartment down, and threatening to kill my neighbour. I needed to call the cops and have him taken into a mental facility, but they found him coherent enough to let him go. I can also hear him talking to himself  day and night. I’ve sought out help for him and the procedures are finally starting to take place. Everything just seems so bleak. I don’t really have anything i look forward to and most days I force myself to do something. My university grades have been falling down and I’m pretty sure that I won't be able to graduate this year.

90,"I have not stopped thinking about you since the day you left. This has been unimaginably difficult to deal with. They say that every person that we meet presents to us a mirror of ourselves. This is true. And quite a mirror you showed. You showed to me so much happiness and life. But this was all possibility. I depend on you to feel fulfilled. And now that you are gone, this imagined life, full of happiness and fulfillment and companionship, has now to faded into nothingness. It felt like I almost had it within reach. This is what makes it extremely hurtful. To see something so great right in front of you disappear before achieving it, it really shows just how little you truly have. 

Now I am left here, alone, as always. Thinking. The unattainment of you presented to me the stark reality of where my pain really comes from, and this makes the loss of you all the more sorrowful. I still desire your affection, your companionship; you. But why I clung onto you ever so desperately is much more complex. 

For years, five to be exact, I have meandered and ghosted through life as a shell. I do what I need to do, and my circumstances demand that this be achieved alone. I could have tried harder, yes, to bring more people in to share my life with. But that doesn't matter now. I have been, on this life, for the longest time, alone. I do not have a single soul in my life that truly comprehends me, or desires to. The support and strength that I needed during the hardest, tumultuous times in my life I found within myself. I have had to suffice for myself. 

But we all know this will not do. Even the strongest of us needs someone at some point. I never had a family to turn to, friends to be and discover myself with, someone to cry to, someone to love and love me back. And then you presented yourself, ever understanding, desiring me despite my brokeness and unachieved personhood.

I saw what I was missing; love in the most unoquivocally pure way. This was not something you most probably presented nor consciously provided to me. Though that is irrelevant. When you're in a desert, thirsty and on the brink of death, even a single drop of water feels like the greatest blessing. And so the mirage, the most elusive, desirable visage began. As too did my desparation to cling to it. 

I envisioned, as one may normally would, what the two of us had in our future. Happy, we would be, living together, achieving together, creating things with people that understood us, things that would change people and make them think, affect them; influence the world. We would need only each other, we would have a family, friends, things. We would travel. We work make the most out of our talents and support each other and love one another and look after the other person. This, you could not provide me. No one can. You will not. 

This was not something you or anyone can give me. This was something that I deserved, that everyone deserves. This is what everyone who is going through this chaos called life requires in order to feel a sense of fulfillment and purpose. These are visions and relationships that I shod have in place already in my life. But I do not. It was not fair of me to expect you to provide this to me. I should not expect you, or anyone, to give me the happiness and fulfillment that I should have. This can only be brought upon by myself. For this, I am truly and deeply sorry. I burdened you with the deficits of my existence, demanded off of you so much. Expected you to give me something which you yourself may not even have. I regret this so much and I am so sorry. 

But despite the pain and loss that I now feel, I am grateful. I know now what is missing within my heart. It is you, yes. I had this vision that you could not give, yet I still want you for all the same reasons why I loved you so much in the first place. However, I must work to become the person that I deserve to be as well as the person you deserve to love you. I know this now. Without your abscense and the hollow within me that it left, I would've carried on living the way that I always have. I know now the work that I want to create, the effect and mark that I want to leave on people and on this world. For this, I can not thank you enough. I am eternally grateful. 

I wish you all the things the that I want for myself, and all the people in this world; love, purpose and genuine, loving connections. I am working toward this, and it is all because of you. I wish you were here now for this journey, although I know you have a journey similar of your own that you need to go through. Until that graceful future comes, I will be here, waiting. Then, perhaps, that mirage may not seem too impossible and incorporeal.

my family treats him as if he was a psychopath when all he needs is help from a professional and not a fucking exorcism.

I posted on here a day or two ago about something else as well.

But me and a good friend of mine were talking and got into the subject of drugs and alcohol (which is pretty rough for me), as where he lives, he's at the legal ages for all this stuff

My mother was an Alchololic, and had plenty of parties, with friends over. Idk if she exactly did pot, but I know alot of her friends drunk, smoke, and did even worse than the usual stuff.

I hated it as a kid, and now it has grown into something bad. Something that'll year my friendships apart

Basically, I hate the shit. And tend to act moody and like an asshole to people who do it. 

While I don't mind drinking one or two beers, I won't dare get waisted or smoke. Not because I'm Christan, but for the after mentioned mother stuff...

Basically, I've lost a few friends because I wouldn't even tollorate a blunt here or there, and it's now causing me to be a dull and boring person, and may even risk relationships

While I don't hate the person directly, I hate the use of drugs its self, and it fucking brothers me

Why can't I just smoke on myself, and be cool, chill and shit.

Why can't I just accept it. I accepted the Alcholol stuff.

Is it because it's tied to my worst childhood memories, and I'm trying to protect the persona my myself from it? What's wrong with me.

I'll listen to music about it, but the moment my best friend (who's 17 mind you, again,.legal in his country) said he drunk and on occasion will smoke, I just shut down, and refuse to talk.

Why can't I just be normally, and not become depressed when sex, Alcholol, or drugs is brought up. I honestly fear I'll do them myself, and be so full of guilt, I'll end it, or possibly hurt someone.

I still don't get why I hate the person. It's just smoking. That'd mean I hate my parents for smoking cigarettes, but if it's a blunt, weed and shit, I lose my mind. I hate it, and just want it to stop, but it won't, and I'm just scared. I feel boring and dull, like I'm just this boring person who won't party, and hate people who just try to have fun or relax.

So I'll dive right in.  Over the past several months my work has suffered due to marital issues. I work from home in sales, and was originally doing very well, but since my marriage began some difficult times (I would prefer to keep that private here for now) work has suffered, I've lost much of the needed motivation  to excel in this kind of situation. My boss has noticed my decline and in my weekly calls with her has been a supportive, but I feel her patience is wearing thin. She keeps asking me if something is wrong but so far I have told her about anything. I feel like we have become friends as well, and I dont like hiding these issues from her.  I find myself at a crossroads now where I need to make a change. I can probably transfer to a different kind of physical office position within the company, but still dont know if I want that specifically. My fear right now is that performance will get me fired, and I'll lose that switch opportunity as well. 
I feel the need to let my boss know what's going on. But, I'm also afraid I'll be either forced into a switch, or let go, as I self admittedly am no longer a good fit for this position, and it will be clear to her after this conversation.

108,"TL;DR: Mom has PTSD from abusive 20+ year marriage that ended 7 years ago. She needs help, won't seek it on her own and her mental health has been deteriorating. What should I do?

My mom divorced my dad after an emotionally abusive 20+ year marriage nearly 7 years ago. My brother and I have tried to be extremely supportive of her throughout the process but its becoming clear that she cannot help herself and our attempts to help her have failed.

She didn't get a fair divorce settlement and we are certain that our dad wasn't forthcoming about their finances. Our mom left the workforce when she had me (eldest) and was a full-time stay at home mother for our entire childhood. Just before the divorce happened, she got a full-time job at a preschool that didn't pay well, but gave her something to do, and she enjoyed spending time with the 3-4 year old kids.

Once the divorce happened, despite it not being a total surprise, my mom was completely broken but in complete denial. Fortunately, her child care role provides health insurance but the pay isn't enough to support her living expenses. I've reviewed her finances and she doesn't have bad spending habits. Her co-workers rely on their spouses' income as her job just isn't sustainable on its own. My mom also spends most of her days speaking to 3-4 year olds, then goes home to watch TV. She does have several good friends that pressure her to be social but she has had trouble holding 'adult' conversations in recent years and become quieter with friends. In the past, she was extremely social and invited to events where she loved sharing stories and talking with her friends.

Mom also has high-blood pressure and the medicine she takes would be too expensive without insurance, so she has been unwilling to look for jobs that don't offer health insurance right away. She is on her feet most the day caring after the kids that she has been too tired to work for Uber, Wag or any other part-time gig related work.

My brother \[26\] currently lives with her and helps subsidize the rent/food but he really needs to move out to live his life but knows she can't afford the rent on her own. Since the divorce, our childhood home was sold and she moved into a home 1/3 of the size of our former house. My dad basically left with a suitcase, a few boxes, and left her to deal with everything else. Mom hasn't thrown anything out and has become an extreme hoarder. My brother and her currently live in a home the is floor to ceiling jam packed with 'stuff'. While most of this stuff isn't trash, it's not likely that 40% of it has much, if any resale value and neither my mom or brother have been motivated to purge or sell stuff. Their living environment is taking a clear emotional toll on both of them.

My brother and I have tried to help her by encouraging her to go to prepaid fitness classes, setting up online dating profiles, providing her with manicure/pedicures (self-confidence), and all but begged her to see a therapist.

I am not a psychologist or psychiatrist and my mother hasn't been officially diagnosed with any mental illness. That said, she has become increasingly paranoid that people are breaking into her home and stealing her belongings. There is no evidence of any break-in, the missing items aren't valuable (especially compared to the things that are in plain sight and are valuable), but she is convinced. She also has been having more extreme mood swings, feeling helpless and defeated. In her eyes, she did everything in life the best she could and was screwed once my dad left her for one of his many mistresses. The marriage was toxic for much of my childhood, and my dad was constantly on the road for work (conveniently finding new mistresses at each stop, some that went on for years). Their fights were almost always a result of her discovering a new mistress and my dad would become extremely angry and aggressive about something trivial until mom was shouted and insulted into submission. She definitely has severe PTSD from years of emotional (possibly physical) abuse.

Her self confidence has never recovered and it has been incredibly painful to feel helpless as she continues her downward spiral. She was starting to get better post divorce when she was able to reconnect with her brother (my uncle) who didn't like my dad. He was really helping pull herself together for the first year when he suddenly suffered a heart attack and died at 51 years old. Obviously, this set her back even further.

At this point, I'm not sure a 1-2x/week therapy session would be enough. I really want to find an inpatient facility or program that she can spend 4-8 weeks with professional care to help stabilize her to the point where a 1-2x/week therapist can be effective once the program ends. I have no idea if these sort of places exist, what they cost or how to determine which place is best. I'd appreciate any recommendations or advice that can help point me in the right direction. Cost is not particularly limiting (she has insurance, and I'm in a position to help with any extra costs) and location would ideally be in Texas but if the best program is elsewhere, I'll make it work.

I'm open to suggestions on how to help my mom, if you don't think a program that specializes is the best, let me know what you'd recommend. I also would love any advice on convincing her to attend such a program, she will certainly refuse at first because she doesn't have enough sick/vacation time for an extended stay but I'll help her cross that bridge when we get there.

113,"Hi there,

I feel like I am an idiot, a worthless piece of bureaucrat. Someone who luckily passed his exams. A threat for the society. I cannot fight this feeling, tho I need it's not true. I would be happy if one of you could help me out of this.

Long story, go down for tldr.

I'm a German 30 yo lawyer. I'm not fully done with all of my exams yet, but in a few months I may be nominated as judge, prosecutor or advocate. In Germany you have two pass 2 exams, both contain a writing and a verbal part. In the first exam, about 30% of the students fail it. After failing 2 times, all your years are gone. You won't be a lawyer. And some more fail during the study. So, it's not that easy. 

I passed the **first** exam easily. My graduation was pretty average. Not horrible, not great. Average. So I went for the **second** exam. While learning for it, you have to visit a lot of courses and write decisions for your judge or you have to represent your prosecutor to accuse defendants in the court. Plus, you are allowed to go for another attempt in your **first** exam to improve your graduation (if you pass it in the first attempt, like I did). My judges told me I was okay. Not the best, not the worst. But I failed my second attempt in the **first** exam. I lost nothing, because this attempt only counts if I improve myself, but holy shit, I was so bad, I have no idea how that happened. I guess it was just too much of stuff to do so I had no concentration for that attempt. And now I am waiting for the graduation of my **second** exam. I guess I was pretty average, too.

Next point: I didn't really learn for my exams. Regarding the first one, I was lazy. Ofc I did something from time to time, but learning 6 days a week for 6 hours a day like others did? No chance. Maybe 6 hours a week. I hate learning and I can't remember very well. And regarding the second one, my son was born just a few weeks before it started. No time for learning left. 

I feel like I cheated myself through those exams. I did not! But passing it without even learning, while 30% fail it? Very lucky I guess.

Some other points left: I'm physically handicapped. I look like a normal one and I'm able to do most stuff, but in fact I am disabled for around 60 points (of 100) like we say in Germany. I have to pop alot of pills every day which maybe affect my ability to concentrate, I dunno. Plus: I didn't have any idea about university before I made it there. My parents never went to a higher school nor studied, same for my brother and sister. And out of my whole, big relation, only 2 ever have been to an university.

All of that makes me thing I don't deserve to be an advocate or judge and just made it there due to the love of gods. But no one ever called me incompetent (well, maybe one, but I guess he is it way more than me).

tl;dr: Upcoming lawyer, passed the exams luckily, even though lots of students fail it. Am I dumb? Or just average?",18Jun2019,1
114,"So I've been pretty lonely these past few years and I think I've come to realize that's in part because I feel defined by my failed relationships and my failed attempts to make new relationships. I've had a girlfriend before, but it's been 7 years at this point and don't know anyone around me who is interested in making an intimate relationship with me. I guess I just feel a lot of negative emotion revolving around all of this, mainly frustration, that comes out a bit at this point whenever I get frustrated. I feel like I need to take care of this issue too because having this come out when I feel frustrated about other things makes it hard to work through it.

How do I get past all of this frustration so it's easier for me to make new friendships even? I just find it hard to put myself out there because I feel like I'm the one having to put all of the work in and that no one hardly puts effort back into me. I don't know if that's true or not either or if it's just my perception of things. Any advice? Thanks",18Jun2019,1

But heart has been aching lately. I feel so alone, except for her. And I don't want to tell her in fear of her thinking I don't love her, which is stupid. Of course she'd understand. 

But things have been hard for me the past 6 years. Ive lived my entire adult life paycheck to paycheck. I've lost my best friends because a few years ago I had a severe mental health episode, and pushed them away. Luckily I got help, but it was too late. 

I've lost parts of my family because of the things I believe, and my fight for others rights. I never realized how racist my dad was until I took the side of a African American man over the side of a white politician, and then he was upset when I refused to support the president. He blocked me, hasn't responded to the rsvp for my wedding. 

And it hurts. It hurts so bad, because hes my dad, and he can't see past disagreements in order to love his son. I love him dispite his views, even though I feel he is wrong with every fiber of my being, I would never turn my back on him. 

Some of my Christian friends arent really my friends anymore, because of my support for LGBTQ peoples. So I don't go to church anymore, even though I still believe. 

I just feel like I have no where to go but the arms of my fiancé. But I don't want to let her become a crutch, because I don't want to drive her away. 

Financially I am strangled, because even though we went as cheap as we could for our wedding, I still paid all the money I have towards it. I want it to be special for both of us. 

I'm just ready for the wedding to be here, so i can have my day with her, and then we can live our lives again.

Things are stressful as they would be for any millennial couple, but we have good goals and at least know what sort of self care activities we need to improve on. Just recently I put in my last two weeks at a job I've been at for 4 years, while suffering severe burnout for about two.


Unfortunately I realize all my problems boil down to entitlement or brattiness: getting angry and frustrated easily, being depressed and lacadasical about my own self care, and just overall not being as understanding a boyfriend as I should be.

Given that I would like this relationship to continue as smoothly as possible, what are some tips and tricks you have for not being overwhelmed by the pressure in your head?

... Im a 27 year old female and this will be the first online comment I made in 10 years. I dont even know how this started I just know I stopped posting anything anywhere and resigned myself to being an online lurker. 

But in the last year its gotten so bad that Im even afraid of talking to my 3 closest friends in group chats on discord/messenger. I will only reply if they PM me and it takes me... hours to gather my courage and write back.

Even writing this I have extreme anxiety about posting and Im re-reading it and my brain is in a loop of trying to run away and its been 40 min since I started this and I have deleted paragraphs of it.. but I suppose this will be my first baby step to actually facing my problems.

131,"I can describe myself as someone who is emphatic..I try to understand people as much as possible 

I try to constantly make new connection but never really maintain them in the end. 

I've cut out a close friend for several reasons including, me realizing that I haven't been there for her as much as she has for me. I feel guilty for it and for minimizing her feelings. Even if there are times that it seems uncalled for, (like doing it in public or with different people at a time) I know deep down she is crying her help. Seeking that validation.  

I seek for validation much like this post. Why am I so hard on her. 

I can make friends easily, but I never seem to maintain them and I'm off to looking for new ones. I don't want to get too close with anyone. But why? 

Someone describes me as quirky and confident at first, but I slowly withdraw and become awkward in the long run. 

Someone had said that I often disappear. 

Someone has said that I never work for things or want the higher ground  

Someone has said that I am a great listener and can easily understand their emotions...That I'm easy going... Chill... Adventurous. 

Why is it so hard for me to maintain relationships without getting irritated or annoyed. 

Am I simply and introvert? Ambivert?is it my personality? 

I'm not even sure what I am asking for anymore.

134,"Honestly people daydream about things often, which is normal. The context of it is important imo though. For those sensitive towards graphic things, stop reading. As an introduction, I'm someone who has major anger issues and really have PTSD-like moments where I just get angry over things I remember. I was unofficially diagnosed by a HS counselor a year back that I could have a Borderline personality disorder/Narcissistic personality disorder as a guy, but idk. Anyways back to my point.

I daydream about me one day having near limitless power and control over everything and everyone, to the point of not having to micromanage anymore and pick and choose whatever I want. I always loved the idea of being this untouchable ""God"" that tortures and stabs people for sexual gratification, and enacting acts of necrophilia/dominance. I love the idea of just executing anyone I want just to prove a point. There is so much in mind I've always wanted to do and feel. Overall in real life I'm your average guy who everyone sees as pleasant and kind around others. No one really knows about this but myself.

I can't help but to wonder, since life is so short, why not play into my desires? Of course it's mostly because it's illegal and I don't intend on doing anything, but that desire is there...that absolute desire to have power over others. Deep down, I believe the only people I care about are those I love, while everyone else is whether pathetic and worthless or just deserves to be ridden off of this world.

142,"I'm at a stage where I'm trying to lie down the foundations of my life. Basically, improving my confidence and mental illness symptoms and preventing burnout in the future. My community link worker has suggested that I go on this trip (or something of the sort) where you do stuff outdoors with a group of people. But it goes on for 12 weeks, and at the moment I feel really pressured to get a job and I'm worried that this trip will eventually interfere in my job searching.  I currently have a sickline due my mental health but I know it won't last forever, and I feel bad asking for more. 

My link worker has already said that I can drop out of the trip if I need to, but I won't feel like I've committed to this group if I know I won't stick with it until the end and I'll feel bad for asking to join and waste everyone's efforts in making preparations for me to join.  I'm worrying about an imaginary job that I haven't even begun looking for yet since I've been busy moving house and getting settled in. I'm worried about asking for too much time off and the repercussions of doing so. The advice to ""stop comparing myself to others"" doesn't seem to be working, knowing that ""this isn't race"" doesn't seem to be sinking in.

On top of that, I feel like I'm being pulled in all directions regarding improving myself and like I'm not doing enough, despite being told I'm ""talented"" at sticking to promises to get stuff done.  ""Go to the gym to lose weight, volunteer to get some social interaction and experience working with people, pay bills on time, figure out how to cook so I can stop buying junk that I binge/purge on, figure out a regular sleeping schedule, go up to see my family during the summer, etc."" A lot of these are not stuff I just do and get it over with, they're all ongoing commitments that constantly have me feeling pressured to be better at them even though they take time. 

My link worker said I have to deal with this low-key pressure in order to prepare for a job, which is constant high-key pressure.

146,"Hi all. Using a throwaway account as a few people i know follow my usual one. 

I recently got diagnosed with severe PTSD and depression. For years i’ve been covering it up by using alcohol as a coping mechanism. Obviously drinking takes it’s toll and i was close to the point of damaging my physical health permanently. To that end i did a self admission to a psychiatric hospital as the military just weren’t interested in helping, to them i was just a functional alcoholic. 

Anyway, to the point. I’ve noticed that when i try to speak about anything even remotely related to the PTSD, even telling someone what treatment i’m getting, i struggle really hard with words and ending sentences. Like i can talk normally and all over a sudden i’ll slur words or gain a complete inability to say them. I have to stop, breath, and try again....

Has anyone else experienced this? Or anything similar? I’ve never had a speech impediment or anything like that, and i’m very well spoken. It’s just of late. 

Any similar experiences would be good to hear.

But how is one supposed to want to get better or know what it looks like when they're trapped in a dungeon that's under lock and key and hasn't been outside in a long time? 

How many therapists and psychiatrists I have seen in the last several years for what? Zoloft, Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Amitriplyine, Buspar, and so on. I've lost myself long ago, and it's like I've come to realize they can't save me and neither can some ideology and certainty no other person than myself.

That progressed substantially after I was born when my birth parents abused/neglected us to the point of almost dying. One day during all this, my Bio-F (biological father) threw my 2 year old brother into a wall causing permanent damage to his corpus calus (the middle part of your brain that connects the left and right side making them function together instead of separately). Very shortly after that happened, my grandparents sent my aunt (we'll call her Becky) to come and take us away from my Bio-parents. Based on what I've been told, they just handed us to Becky and never asked any questions. Fast forward two more years and my grandparents have adopted us, we've called them Mom and Dad ever since. When they adopted my brother and I, my dad had just retired from working at a construction company for many years, and so with the money he saved we were pretty well off. That was until 6 years later when we had to move out of our area because of the rising gang crime. My dad being from Texas, loved the outdoors and had family in Tennessee, so thats where we ended up moving. We moved into a trailer on top of a hill with few nieghbors and 5 acres of wooded forest (perfect for hunting my dad always said). It was nice but starting to run down because the people who ownwed it before us hadnt taken care of it whatsoever. Flash forward about 5 more years and weve made pretty good progress on making this trailer something to be proud of. Then suddenly, the unimaginable happens. On April 27, 2011; one of the most devistating storms ever recorded in the central US hit our area hard. We didnt loose the house, not all of it anyways, but it was still in shambles. It hit my brother super hard. I think with his condition it gave him some type of PTSD, and I dont blame him considering that the roof was torn off of about 1/3 of the house and I was very sure that I was going to die that day.  We were living off of my Dad's social security, which most of you should know is barely enough to support a small family. And since we had awful insurance, it payed for litterally the bare minimum of our house to get fixed. After that day we havent had a month I dont remember having to struggle to pay for our bills and keep our family a float. It has gotten more and more stressful the older I've gotten and more I realize how bad our situation has really been. And also the older ive gotten, more ive been noticing how its effecting the rest of my family. I am 19 now. My now 69 year old Dad is starting to emotionally break down from the constent stress hes put under every day. My brother is becoming more and more beligerant and socially distant the less hes able to socialize with people other than his stressed family due to the fact that we dont have the money to tale him to the places  We take him places but its far and few between; and its not that we dont want to, its just that everyone here is so emotionally drained from trying to keep our sh!tty house. And on top of all of this my Mom is extremely bipolar, she has an episode atleast every 3-5 months where she goes balistic. Throwing kitchenware, calling me and my brother pieces of sh!t, hitting me with a broom while I slept on the couch in the living room because I left my bookbag on the floor, trying to kick me and my mentally challenged brother out onto the street, and I know that she is making my dad absolutely miserable because they've been married for almost 50 years and still loves her very much. This all came into fruition when the tornadoes hit our area. She has always been bipolar, but because of our stable livelyhood she was able to keep it under control with the help of some medication. Now I dont even know what happened, she's turned into someone I dont even remember. Its making my brother someone who picks up on her bad habbits and I'm afraid that he'll never be able to have friends or a family of his own because of his condition and emotionally devastating upbringing. I'm afraid that my dad is going to have a stroke and dye right in front of my eyes every time the family argues. There has been so much discord in this house the past 4 years that its gotten to the point where there are arguments every day, someone is yelling at someone every day. Its driving me insane and I dont know what to do. I cant say that I dont contribute to the yelling, but usually when I do I'm defending my brother from my mom or defending myself from someone else. When I'm out of the house seeing friends with my brother and girlfriend I try to keep a happy face but on the inside I'm dying. I'm really starting to be afraid for my mental health and afraid for the rest of my family. My girlfriend keeps me sane but I think im getting close to that point of completely becoming numb of everything. Ive been like that before and I dont want to be that way again. 

P.s. My girlfriend lives with us as well (we've been together for 5 years so she knows what my family is like and can handle herself), she is the strongest person I have ever met and is my absolute rock. I don't think that I would be here if it wasn't for her.  I still feel bad for her though. Having to deal with all of this even though it really shouldn't be her problem. But she insists that she wants to be with me forever despite whatever comes with that. I believe her and it keeps me going. 

P.p.s. I'm sorry that this is so long. It wasnt intended for this to be a ""let me tell you my life story"" type of thing but I feel like theres just too many details to leave out.",18Jun2019,2

171,"I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety since forever, without much triggering them, but recently my last grandparent passed away, I’m having family issues and it hit an all time low yesterday when I found out the only person keeping me going and the one I unfortunately depended on to make me feel better has betrayed me in the worst way possible. 

I was able to get through many events without antidepressants but it feels like I’m never gonna make it through this, I need to feel better, I’m starting a new job this week and I can’t do it without something to help.

I was thinking of going to see a GP and telling them my symptoms, that’s what my therapist told me to do. any advice regarding this would be appreciated.",18Jun2019,1
