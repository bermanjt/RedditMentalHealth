0,"I (18F) was wondering if anybody has had the same experience as me.
I was prescribed Welbutrin on Monday by my doctor. The first day after taking it was great, other than an extremely disturbing dream that night. I also am taking Effexor every other day for a week, because that is what I was on before. 
I have slight depression and anxiety, but I haven’t really been feeling much anxiety. However I am extremely depressed. I keep getting stuck on things and crying about everything. I don’t feel very motivated to do much. I’m getting annoyed with everybody, and I feel SO lonely.
I know that it takes a while for medications to start to work, so does anyone have any experience of feeling the same way but getting better over time with Welbutrin? I also love the side effects of a decreased appetite and higher libido, so I am really hoping that this all blows over. ",16Feb2019,2
1,"I’ve come to realize that I like people that have experienced pain and challenges the most because they typically are more genuine and real. Their experiences have shaped character, humility, and authenticity, so they’re less likely to be stuck up and petty. Nothing against those that can’t really say they understand what actual depression, anxiety, and traumatic experiences is like, but there’s something special about survivors. I wish our culture would grow to understand and value this more instead of acting like it’s a flaw if you don’t present with a “happy-go-lucky” face all the time. We should have a more open culture that makes people feel okay with expressing more than a few limited emotions and ideas. After all, we’re humans. Humans are undeniably complex creatures. Why pretend like we’re not? ",16Feb2019,3
2,"I don't know where else to turn ... I have tried everything but nothing has helped, I have vented but the people I have vented made me feel worse or as if I were at fault. I feel like I am being forced to bottle all of this up. 

I genuinely do not know why I am typing this out ... I do not know what will come out of it but I hope somebody here ... If anything will keep me from giving up because I no longer have what it takes to stay alive. 

This is a quick rundown of my life, 

Anything before 8 years old I do not remember so it is pointless and meaningless to me.

From 9 to 14 years old my family lost everything ... We lived in a truck at times on the street was where I spent most of my days because my dad used it for work so often so we would have to wear heavy jackets in the freezing nights by the factories where we had our truck parked to rest in and such. 

My parents were too busy arguing over what to eat that I never felt loved or comfort ... All I knew as a kid was that this life was normal. Some days I grew so desperate for food I stole from the nearby gas station. If my parents weren't fighting my brother would return to ask for money or food despite him living off his girlfriend.

At 11 years old I devoloped my first relationship ... But it wasnt with anything living but a bell, my parents got jobs as caterers for the community center and thankful they allowed me to eat food they served at the events too knowing our situation and all ... This bell rang when it was break time for the caterers to eat ... So i would sit there hoping to hear it and sadly thats the way I grew up ... Knowing that bell kept me fed, I was a kid I didnt know any better.

My relationship with people never started off the right way, hell my parents argued so much I thought they may have even forgotten they had a son. My only interaction with people was only at school and thats where it only worsened ... I was bullied and occasionally beat up.

At 14 years old I guess my dad was fed up to since he took the car and told us he had been fed up. He wanted out, he was going to kill himself and we had panicked, my mom dialing 911. My dad returned apologizing but it didnt take long before the police arrived after him... I will never forget those sirens which are now embedded into my mind. 

I saw my dad get arrested right there but eventually he never really caused some harm so they let him go.

At 15 I got my first friend and my mom had saved up for an apartment. Again this friend wasnt really a person but a bearded dragon ... Rex. She was my best friend and I was adjusting to my new life in a home for the first time it felt strange. 

I was going to therapy and was diagnosed with PTSD and Bipolar Disorder I have gotten better at managing it but still never had the time rebuilding a foundation for myself... Before my brother moved in. He took over the house the couch I slept on was gone it was his now I was forced to sleep in the closet which I hated cause I was extremely claustrophobic and it reminded me of the truck. 

He had a temper problem and if he was mad I became his human punching bag. It escalated too it would get worse the next time that the cloaet became a safe place for me despite how much i hated it... And that day where I went to my therapist was this and the marks he left me ... Ultimately i was the one kicked out ... Not him but me ... And it made my life far more difficult ... 

I go to the same school but I live in another city. My dad reminds me of the truck and I hate it and him. When I get triggered from something and have a panic attack he tries to hug me which worsens me because ... The only interactions i have had with a person was being hit ... Not once have i been hugged or kissed or told I will be okay.

Sometimes I cannot sleep but if I disobey I get yelled at to sleep when I refuse because I know I will remember something and I would rather not 

I was doing fine for a while and I have more i would rather keep burried in the past but ... I am getting worse again these self harming thoughts and episodes are getfing stronger ... I am know to do impulsivde things and what scares me most is that I am not scared anymore...

The other day my memory is still fuzzy so I apologize I don't remember alot but I woke up with such a bad headache my dad scolded me ... He found me on the floor with my head bleeding a bit and I couldnt explain it I mean i know i would hit myself during episodes but it was never as bad as what happened that day.

I ... Dont know what else to do ... I have a girlfriend i love and my friend Rex passed away last year her slot filled by her two offsprings Lapis and Ruby i dont know what else to do but beg for help ... So please help me.",16Feb2019,1
3,"I think I might have an addiction to pornography and it’s been screwing up my relationship with my best friend.

I’ve already had a best friend, but I’ve got so obsessed with my connection to this girl that I consider her to be on top for me as well. I’ve never realized how much I loved her until I started feeling ashamed for how I felt about her.

I was looking through YouTube and found a subreddit called r/niceguys because of a SorrowTV video. That mindset of guys saying girls only dating bad guys made me so scared. I was scared because I always compared myself to those guys. They only feel lustful desires towards girls they supposedly love. I felt so bitter towards all of it and made it a part of my every day life to stop desiring sex from this girl when I already loved her for who she is.

Why do I obsess? It’s because I love this girl and I’m scared of losing her.

I slowly started overthinking about everything she said to me at the time. talking to her became extremely hard for me for awhile because I felt like I couldn’t trust myself to be an actual friend to her anymore. 

Before my obsession:
I felt ashamed of myself after a school dance. I believed I might have been coming on too strong to her. She called out my name across the crowd when me and my friends got there. She ran over to me and enthusiastically gave me a hug. I felt like she was flirting with me. Midway through the dance I saw her dancing with other dudes, but as soon as I asked her to dance she declined. She told me she had a boyfriend and ran out of the room.

My brother (male best friend) had his own problems that night. He was about to get in a fight with someone. That’s irrelevant but anyways, I asked him for advice and he told me that she was leading me on and teasing me the whole time. I absolutely refused to believe it at the time, because I still loved her. I felt like I had a more loyal friendship with her. 

This event caused me a lot of pain and because of that I couldn’t help but try to cope. I coped by starting a revenge plot against her where I’d set her up and be a piece of shit. I told my brother about it and he ended up telling the girl to talk to me about something. I was upset with him for saying something, but I’m so thankful he stopped me. I apologized to her about it over our school messages because it was too hard to talk to her about it anyways since I was shy.

I found out one night that she had sex with a guy in our school. This devastated me so much that my brain couldn’t function properly for two whole weeks. I ended up having “I don’t care what happens to me” thoughts racing through my head. I felt extremely uneasy an anxious and it was nearly impossible to explain it. 

I had this complex in my mind saying that my experiences were nothing like anyone’s at all prior to the event.

I was scared for this girl that she messed up her reputation or something. Every time I heard someone talk about her I had this intense urge to bring violence.

I started hanging out with this scummy guy that used to harass her on Facebook a lot. He put obstacles in front of me without realizing it. 

I’ve done a lot of screwed up things last year (Blackmailing, breaking up friendships etc) because of an identity crisis I went through while trying to achieve some goal. I didn’t know what that goal was at the time, but I’m thinking I was probably trying to get the girl to like me. It was extremely insatiable and I was addicted to hugging her. Every time I hugged her, my head was filled with oxytocin and it made me want to hug her more. Eventually being around her made me feel amazing and I loved every second I spent with her.

I got depressed whenever we’d be apart.  I started connecting my love to her to when we were kids and I had no sexual feelings for her. All I felt was love (the type of love you’d have for a crush when you’re a kid.)

I put myself down for wanting to date her. I had this very vivid dream of us just laying in bed. For some odd reason none of that ever weirded me out until I tried to prevent it. I always confused my love for her with my lust and eventually me wanting to just be friends turned into my brain wanting to be friends with her just to date her. I’ve almost completely got out of that mindset and after all of that I’ve still been obsessed.

Most of the obsession is me trying to figure out how to have a good relationship with this girl. It’s caused me to eventually become depressed and end up in the hospital. I was there for the last two weeks of school.

There’s so much more information to this. ",16Feb2019,1

&lt;Alice!&gt; it's like  
&lt;Alice!&gt; there's this big wound  
&lt;Alice!&gt; and they pile bandages on it [therapists, people I talk to]  
&lt;Alice!&gt; but it's not helping  
&lt;Alice!&gt; it's not healing  
&lt;Alice!&gt; I scratch at it because I'm hurting and they just pile on the bandages  
&lt;Alice!&gt; for years  
&lt;Alice!&gt; I forget it's even there  
&lt;Alice!&gt; but it comes back  
&lt;Alice!&gt; comes back so hard I get a literal emotional shock from it  
&lt;Alice!&gt; a shellshock  
&lt;Alice!&gt; with a few echoes, ripples in the day after  

1. there's *something* wrong, that wound that I talked about earlier, that everyone keeps plastering over

2. most of the time I'm not aware that anything like this exists

3. from time to time I have a dissociative attack/episode/period when I remember such a thing exists and remember all the previous times I was in that state and also realised that

4. this state of awareness fades pretty quickly if I'm pulled out of it or it ""times out"", i.e. I distract myself from it

5. as it fades I scramble to preserve anything about that episode because I know I'm going to forget it

6. despite that, I find it difficult to remember the specifics of it after it fades and I usually don't pick the topic up later, feeling like I want to talk about something but my mind comes up empty

7. when I'm with other people at the time I go into total honesty mode, basically just talking straight to my superego

8. I crave these moments a lot because I want to get to the bottom of this but everyone's reaction is to pull me out of it

9. Lauren Bousfield-y music (loud, very chaotic and powerful) sustains it

10. sometimes it feels like going ""outside reality"" what I mean by that is: imagine being immersed in a game or a movie and then pausing and taking a look around, that's the closest I can get to describing it

I've been struggling with anxiety and depression for a long time and I just left school due to how bad it's gotten and am now living with my parents and little brother. I'm on a low dose (according to the therapist I saw while at school) of lexapro and for the last year or so I feel like it hasn't been working. 

I don't get along well with my family. when I come home from school I usually stay with my boyfriend as much as possible because they drive me crazy. my boyfriend is out of town this month so I can't stay with him right now. my parents always fight, my mom or brother is always yelling at our cat, the house is a mess and I just can't stand it here in general. I know in her head my mom thinks she is being supportive but she thinks her way is the only way and if I disagree she takes it personally and it turns into a screaming match every time. tonight she said my medication has turned me into someone else (I'm assuming she means mean) and she does piss me off to no end but she is the only one who makes me so irate so I find it hard to believe it's my medication. talking about finding a psychiatrist, she said ""don't let them increase your dosage"" and a week ago she suggested I start going off my medication before I go in to see a psychiatrist because she ""researched it"". she knows I have struggled with suicidal thoughts. when I told her I wanted to leave school she dumped all this stuff on me about finances and put all this pressure on me about ""getting behind in school"" even though my therapist advised me not to worry about that and that taking a few months for mental health instead of school is a wise choice in the long term. my mom also told me she wants to me to go to this healthy eating workshop thing that talks about how our diet affects mood which I am fully aware of. I have been working out four times a week for the past 6 months except for a few stressful weeks and eating the best I ever have and this is the worst I have ever felt in my life. like I'm seriously fucking trying. I told her I'm doing everything I can but I that I need to be on medication and she just goes off saying I need to think positive and work towards an end goal of not being on meds, which I am, I just don't think it's feasible right now. I feel like she twists everything I say and she's not being supportive in the way I need her to be.

I'm happy to give more details but I just want to know... is she right? am I being a total bitch? or is it ok to want to deal with this in the way I want? should I be taking her claims about the medication's effect on me more seriously? is she overstepping as much as I feel she is? is it ok that I'm pissed at her? I guess I'm just looking for input from an outside perspective. I'm convinced she thinks medication is the enemy and she is overlooking the fact that irritability is also a symptom of depression/anxiety. anyway... sorry for this long shitty post...

11,"Hi everyone. It’s my first time posting here and I’m seeking some advice or thoughtful suggestions on something I could do to break a detrimental pattern of behaviour I have. 

Without going too much into things  I’m having a lot of issues at the moment relating to anxiety and stress - for occupational, financial, and personal reasons. Recently I have found myself most nights sitting at home and falling asleep on the couch, waking up in the middle of the night, and then going to bed. 

This whole cycle leaves me with a night of terrible sleep and makes me feel completely deflated and worthless (on top of everything else that’s going on). I wake up on the couch feeling terrible and like I’ve wasted a lot of time just sitting there and sleeping. 

I typically watch YouTube videos while I’m sat there. I want to do something like play video games amongst other things, but because I’m already so low and crappy, I can’t muster the energy to do so and so end up in the same place watching YouTube and falling asleep on the couch. I can’t go out anywhere at these moments because I have a young daughter who is sleeping upstairs and my partner works nights. Most of my friends don’t drive or are busy and can’t hang out. So when these nights roll around all I can do is sit alone watching YouTube and then falling asleep. 

This probably doesn’t sound like much of an issue but it’s really starting to drag down the home life element of my time which is adding to the anxiety and stress I’m having elsewhere. 

Does anyone have any recommendations or advise on what I can do to try and break this rut? I feel if I could do so it may be the first step of many of improving my experiences as a whole. 

Thanks!",16Feb2019,1
12,"I believe I have found contentment.

I look back over my once perceived 'failings' like someone hiking to a summit would gaze down at their trail, over the easy passes and hard cliff faces, reminiscing the moments of losing and gaining my footing in equal measure. I see now that only by struggling up the climb could I learn to appreciate the plateaus. And I remind myself that it is both the journey AND the view that drives me on.

&amp;#x200B;

""Perhaps this isn't the end"" I ponder. Prying my gaze from my past...my laurels, I look ahead. The journey further up looks hard, but my effort so far has made me much stronger! As I reach down to gather my rucksack, I hear footsteps...I hear voices!! The more I focus on them, the more I hear. ""I'M NOT ALONE!"" I shout. A group of travelers pass by me and smile. One gaze lingers, a glint in their eye....It feels so familiar.

&amp;#x200B;

I run towards the group and introduce myself. They all nod back at me one by one saying ""Hi, my name is Courage. I saw you back when you decided to start up this path."" ""Hello, I'm Perseverance. I found you when you were struggling but made the decision to keep going."" ""Heya! My name is Passion...We met when you first found joy in your hike. Though things got hard sometimes, I never left you!""

&amp;#x200B;

I look past the group and my eyes meet with a new face, their gaze seems to glint with....

""Oh sorry,"" Courage says, ""this is Hope. She is kind of shy, but we couldn't have made it this far without her!"" Hope smiles at me.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope....

16,"Very new here; I’ve read many posts and I find myself loving this community (good place to vent and hopefully find people to relate with). 

So for the last 4 years, (19 M now), I have struggled with terrible anxiety. I learned how to cope with the anxiety and I was able to graduate high school, attend college, have my clubs, hold down a job and anything else I wanted, but I knew my limits - all without therapy or medications. 

Fast forward to a month ago when two panic attacks (both in public and I was helpless to stop them) sent me over the edge and I’ve been almost grounded to my home. I can go out, I fear interacting with people in case I have yet another panic attack. I have now moved to all online classes and I could not manage a normal day on campus or even in life. 

I have medication now (won’t share what it is because I cannot stomach side-effect stories), but I am scared to death to take them. My thoughts are crazy! What will the side effects be? Will I have a bad reaction? Will they not work? Will I become dependent? 

Honestly all I’m looking for are some reassuring words and maybe hear someone else’s struggle. ",16Feb2019,2

For example my granparents live fairly close to my family's house and I talk to them regularly but the more I talk to them the less I really enjoy or care about being in their company.

More recently I've been trying to limit my contact with them because I feel like if I spend any more time with them I'll end up getting into an argument with them and damaging their view of their ""Fantastic"" grandson, which I don't want to do because I have some intense self consciousness issues and I'm afraid that damaging their view of me will impact their relashionship with the rest of my family.

23,"So, maybe this is just a bit of pointless venting but I think I’m done. I think after decades of digging in and fighting through my slow but steady decline into depression, anxiety, ptsd, counter dependency or whatever cocktail of issues I can’t find a psychiatrist to diagnose on my own, trying to improve myself or my situation to get to something at least balanced. I might have to concede I can’t.

It sounds stupid and like I’m throwing myself a pity party even to say but I think I’m three decades on this planet I’ve had one person in my life in elementary school who was my real, genuine friend. I don’t have real family, I have one or two acquaintances... but that’s it. How many decades here and that’s it?

I could blame others and say everyone sucks. And maybe my luck is bad and many of them really do. I’ve been ostracized by more than one social group for speaking up about men (my ‘friends’) repeatedly touching me in unwanted ways for instance. But with a pattern that consistent, at this point I think I have to concede maybe it’s just me. 

I know I can come across as cold and aloof sometimes. I’m not at all certain if it’s a result of things that have happened to me in my life or if I maybe honestly just never felt basic emotions the same way as most. I know I don’t anymore. 

I can fake it. I can make myself into the fun to be around, thoughtless girl who only asks about others and never inconveniences anyone by talking about themselves too much or being a downer. But I just can’t anymore. Beyond living a lie it just reinforces in my own head what I’ve been taught my whole life; that I’m not interesting. I’m not special. While I know I have value and worth, my self esteem hasn’t suffered like many people
seem to be dealing with. But... what the hell does it matter if (I think) I’m smart and nice and helpful and charming when I want to be or anything else... if nobody else cares? 

I’ve tried to get help for over three years now after a string of really bad incidents involving a list of major authority figures started making my life hell in a fun variety of unpredictable ways. I have a fair understanding that I can’t fix this myself here. Especially if I just don’t see whatever it is about myself that everyone hates so much...

But every attempt just winds up driving me deeper into this hole.
Without filling an already long post with more boring details, People (friends, family, MH professionals, clergy, etc) just don’t believe I have a problem (or I can’t afford to get someone to pretend to) Maybe because I’m calm and collected and fake as hell when I’m around people. I don’t think I can turn the ‘I’m fine’ act off though. I feel almost nothing at all anymore. Everything has been an act for a loooong time now and I’ve been perfecting this part I play since I was like 13. Maybe they just don’t believe what I’m telling them when what I’m showing them seems to contradict it? 
I don’t care anymore.

About anything.

When I’ve pushed past my distrust of people to try looking for support the people I have tried to confide in (the only ones I have left) have told me I’m making it up or outright ghosted me. My most recent attempt to get seen by a professional she cancelled on me and hasn’t rescheduled. It’s been a week. And it’s a government system. Took me 6 months calling just to get that appointment in the first place. I don’t know if I have it left in me to do that again.

I just don’t believe there’s anything left I haven’t tried. I’m exhausted clear through to my soul. I’m surprised and disappointed that I keep waking up every morning. I can’t see the point of fighting for someone nobody else really gives a shit about anyway. I don’t want to accept this half life.

I’m ready to be done.

So, What am I missing? What does a well adjusted person see that I don’t? Or what makes this misery worth the fight to sustain it any further? ",16Feb2019,1
24,"Friday night and I’m at home alone, well not alone, my dog is here, and to be honest the fact that he is a living being that needs me is probably one main reason that shit hasn’t gotten “drastic” yet. Here are some other reasons.

1.	Well I love my family I couldn’t do that to them, because I know they’d ask what they could’ve done differently. My parents would be shocked, or maybe they wouldn’t I don’t know, but I’d like to believe that it would hurt them and I don’t want them blaming themselves for any of my god damned schemes. Even worse I can imagine the forced, fake concern from the group of people around them. The feigned sympathy and “thoughts and prayers” that would be directed their way that would honestly make it harder for them to forget the stain that I left on their lives. I also don’t want to saddle them with my debt from the private schools and credit cards that are filled with purchases of things that were supposed to make it better but ended up making me hate myself more. 


2.	My friends or at least acquaintances. Let me be clear I have a few friends. These people that I love but unfortunately those are the people who are actually the furthest away from me. Maybe there is something to that. I’m just that big of a pain in the ass or just not worth peoples time that the ones who actually give a damn are the ones who live 100 or more miles away from me. There are 3 friends that I love dearly and who show me love and I’m grateful for them. 

3.	Lastly I’m a coward, a pussy, someone who has put the gun to his head but couldn’t pull the trigger and let's be honest, this is going last because I’m trying to hold on to the modicum of pride that is still present. This is the first and foremost reason and it’s a lie to put it last but tough shit. This is my time to write. 

I feel like I’ve been living a lie. The fake smile, the canned response of “things are good” or the same shit I spout with the custodians “livin’ the dream” or “just another day in paradise”. It’s easier for people to not have to worry about the pathetic loser in room 3 or apartment 203. Why worry them, plus no one really wants to hear that you’ve had a shit day or that you’re lonely.

I’m so lonely and the only people I have a connection with are the ones who live miles and miles away. The other people are my friends when it is convenient for them, when I can do something for them, but honestly no one wants to hang out with me. One would probably now say well you don’t reach out, you don’t try, well that’s been beat out of me anymore. I can only ask people to hang out so many times before I want to save them the hassle of making up some excuse of why they can’t. That also makes it so I don’t have to stand there like a dipshit with a grin on my face assuring them that “its ok” and telling them to “have a good weekend” or to “travel safe” you see I put up this nice guy facade and to be honest I don’t know why. These are the same people though who if they need something will come and ask me in a heartbeat because I’m to spineless to say no. I’m not trying to sound like a victim here but honestly who gives a shit any ways. Here’s the most pathetic shit. I was a fucking 3rd wheel on my own birthday. Yea no one came except for one couple who was already planning on going to the event so yea I crashed their date. Then someone pitied me enough to Venmo me money instead of sticking around to have a beer. Again, I’m a friend when it’s convenient to people and a burden to them the rest of the time. 

I didn’t use to feel this lonely. I used to have a life, with more people that I called friends, but I put that on hold to focus on my career. Well I’ve got one expensive piece of paper but now I’m lonlier than ever. You see the two that I got really close with in the program have their own lives and I just don’t fit in. Its not their fault. Who would want to spend more time with this dumpster fire? GET THE FUCK OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!!!

People say you’re a good guy, you’ll find someone. Well I’ll argue against that. I’m not a good guy. I’m petty, and I hold grudges. I judge the shit out of people because it makes me feel slightly better most days. I’ll smile to your face and talk shit about you when you walk out of the room. Disgusted yet? No? Let’s keep going. I lust after a married woman who is the only person that I feel gets me. She’s amazing she truly is and she is someone who means the world to me, but, she’s not mine, she never was, and she never will be. But does that stop me from being a sleazy perv about her? Sure, as shit doesn’t. 

Then there’s the ex-wife of a fraternity brother who I message regularly and who calls me babe and I reciprocate. Have I talked to the fraternity brother? No because remember I’m a shitty human being. Does that stop me from fantasizing about a life with this woman? Nope. Guess what though, it won’t happen… why?  Say it with me, I’m a bad person. I’ve just got a few people tricked that’s all. 

So after all this rambling, I’m realizing that maybe I don’t have people tricked, I don’t have people fooled and they’ve all caught on to my bull shit. Now they tolerate me and wait for me to go away. Unfortunately, as I’ve already discussed, I’m too much of a coward to do anything expedient or quick so they’re stuck with me. So, I’ll stick to suicide the slow way. I’ll eat and drink myself into oblivion. Because then no one else will have to feel guilty and everyone can say yea he had it coming that fat fuck. I’ll have to make sure the dog is elsewhere when that day comes. He can go to someone new and forget about me too. Also death by overeating at least means some form of human interaction and the people at Chick-fil-a are pleasant so there’s a plus.

25,"Have any of you experienced this way due to mental health? 

I have been in several relationships that ended because of my inability to maintain myself. 

A few months ago I met someone and we like each other a lot. Things unintentionally moved quickly. Unfortunately because of numerous things within myself, I do not think I will be able to date them, or feel worthy of doing so. They have been transparent and told me that when I have presented myself in certain ways (always putting myself down, etc) it has turned them off or pushed them away. I have a theme of pushing people away/self sabotage. It is a vicious cycle. 
Since this person has already seen my dark side (he is still my number one cheerleader right now and likes me) I am always ashamed and embarrassed around him... even if things are going well. I think that I can never keep someone around if they are level minded and going places. It is as if I will end up with someone equally messed up, or entirely alone. My black and white thinking is also a real downer. I am aware of my issues and wish they would resolve already so I could be a healthy person/someone to be with. I am tired of wearing people down or being considered insufferable. Even though he is still giving me a chance, I know he has already experience enough to move on when he meets someone who has themselves together.

28,"And honestly, I can never really tell whether or not the meds are working. I know I'm supposed to be on them, so I take them as prescribed. I've been medicated on/off (mostly on) for the last 13 years. They adjusted my meds again, and I'm still not sure what it's supposed to feel like when they're working? They've added some, taken away some, changed doses and frequency, and every time they ask I say ""yep. It's working fine"" because I never have any serious side effects. But it's all fine...until it's not. And then it's back to the hospital. It's very frustrating, especially considering how much I spend on them every month. I'm currently on a cocktail of lithium, wellbutrin, lamictal, trazadone, and hydroxyzine. I've been on lexapro, seroquel, resperidone, ativan, xanax, &amp; klonopin. And still, I've been hospitalized 6 times. I know meds aren't the only thing to rely on—I see a therapist every week, I've got friends around me, I exercise daily, I make time for art, I stay away from alcohol/drugs 99% of the time, I get a decent amount of sleep, I have a daily routine that I stick to for the most part, I go in &amp; out of eating healthily, &amp; I take my meds when I'm supposed to. Every time I get out of the hospital, I intend for it to be the last time I'm in there, but so far, that hasn't been the case over the last 12 years. Wow, did this turn into a rant. I guess I just needed to vent to strangers who may also get it.

30,"I have depression and have been feeling this way for years. I have seen therapists and have taken (and currently taken depression medication) and nothing seems to help.

I have this overall unhappiness with my life and i feel stuck and don't know how to get past it.

I'm 29 and I'm gay and i just feel so lost like i dont fit in anywhere. I dont get along with other gay men because they tend to be very nasty and judgemental and their behavior is just so extra but i dont fit in with other straight guys because well unlike most of them i cant sit there and relate to talking about hot womand and typical guy stuff. Also most people/ friemds my age (straight people anyways) are getting married, or already married, buying houses and having kids so they are drifting off with their busy lives and losing touch and I can't relate to them because i am not on that same path... I grew up in a kind of rural town so it's not like there's a big gay dating scene (in fact there's none) and most gay guys that there are just want to hookup, party and have orgys (serious relationships are a rarity with most gay men). As a result I'm 29 and I've never really dated and have never had a relationship so I really can't relate to anyone else my age as far as that goes and i feel really down and upset about it. Also, since I'm single (aka 1 income instead of 2) and am on top of that back in school to further my education (which means cutting my hours at work), I'm still living home with family because i cant afford to have a place of my own on my salary while in school. And unlike 99% of other people my age or in my classes I dont have a significant other to live with and split the bills and help me through school.

So needless to say as 30 is coming around I am increasingly getting depressed and starting to have bad anxiety attacks because I feel like a loser that I am going to be 30 and have never dated/ had a relationship and am still living at home. I feel so behind compared to everyone my age and its really upsetting and depressing me. I feel like people view me weirdly and it all is just plummeting ny already low self esteem.

Since my last year of high school, seven years ago, I’ve had mornings that I’ve woken up as a nervous wreck especially if there’s exams or something significant due that day, running to the bathroom to puke. It stopped for a while. However, now along with this liver problem I’ve developed, and bad reflux since I haven’t got a thyroid, this can make it much worse. 

A lot of the times I have to be sick it’s bile, this is to do with the liver problem. My point is, my psychologist has noted that it’s generalised and I just want to know the extent that GA could be. I have trembling hands most times too thanks to the thyroid medicine. This is just an ongoing thing. Does anyone have advice to sort of keep this at bay? My family or course want to know what else is possible too. Currently working on my diet too, of course.

36,"For about four or so years (that I can remember; may be longer), I have experienced what I have now come to understand through my own research as dissociation, including both derealisation and depersonalization. For a long time i didn't understand what was happening (obviously still don't completely) and have numerous journal entries just saying things like ""i don't understand what's happening. i'm going crazy"" or ""everything seems fake. im not really alive. i dont even know how to put how im feeling/living into words"" or ""most of the time, when I look in the mirror I feel no connection whatsoever"". It would happen constantly, not just during a panic attack. It started happening before I even had my first true panic attack. However in my quite extensive research, the same thing gets repeated over and over that this stems from trauma. While this makes perfect sense, I have not suffered from trauma or abuse or ptsd or anything like that. It's difficult because most of the online resources for dissociation circle back to trauma which ultimately is not helpful. The last time I spoke with a psychiatrist, a little less than a year ago, I described what I was feeling and expected her to say oh of course that is dissociation. But, she didn't, she first asked if I had trauma, I said no, and she moved on. Is it possible to deal with dissociation without trauma? Or am I completely off, or just crazy? 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Background on my mental health: I suffered from anorexia for about three years, causing me to miss about half of my 8th grade year in treatment centers. I also self harmed for about that same length of time and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety during that time as well. A little over a year ago during my freshman year of college I started having panic attacks and was diagnosed with panic disorder. I am currently on Lexapro 20 mg and have been taking it for about a year. My panic attacks, depression and anxiety have been well under control for a bit now as well as my dissociation. But I still am curious about this and don't doubt that it will ""flare up"" again.

All my mental issues are usually from chemical imbalances not real reasons so the medicine was really turning things around but then something in me snapped. A culmination of all these shitty shitty events have made me revert back into a paranoid, anxious, and depressed headspace and now my perception of everything is so negative and I'm so deep in my head I can't tell if it's actually that way or just that I'm far too anxious about everything and therefore finding issues where there aren't but either way I'm miserable.

25F. Since my best friend died by suicide in 2017, I’ve struggled with what my psychologist has said is adjustment disorder. I see her regular and we’re working on things. But I just feel like I’m getting worse. 

I’ve been suicidal for most of the time since my friend died. 

About 5 weeks ago I began self harming. It finally feels like I’m in control of something. I can’t fix my physical health (RA, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue). I can’t fix or save other people. I couldn’t save my best friend. I can’t control my emotions. But I can control a razor blade. 

And the scars, they prove that my pain is real. My pain is valid. And yet it remains hidden so I don’t have to tell anyone how much I’m hurting. 

And when I harm, I feel like maybe I can manage to keep living... 

But when the cuts aren’t deep and they fade I have to cut to prove my pain isn’t fading. And then I cut deeper so the scars stay longer. 

I know I can’t keep doing this forever. But it’s the thing that actually feels good and like it actually helps... I don’t want to stop because I don’t think I can cope... ",16Feb2019,1

44,"For those willing to read this: thank you and sorry for any grammar mistakes

I suffer from very bad anxiety and possibly depression (I can't confirm this because I have not been formerly diagnosed but I will deal with it at a later date). I am not on meds.

I got a Reddit account because I have been having problems reaching out to others about what I go through. I feel like I can't trust my family because no one in my household seems to take me seriously. 

To make this easier to read, I am going to kinda list some major every day struggles. I am unsure what I can do to fix them and I would appreciate any advice within reason. 

Here is some things I have struggles with:
I have a tendancy to not be able to sit still and I pace around the room when I hear certain sounds and when I am in distress 

I also tend to feel guilty for absolutely no reason. If I try something new about 15 minutes later I feel like total trash and that (for some reason?) I feel like I did something wrong. I have no idea where the guilt comes from.

I have strict but loving parents, but they don't take me seriously and it is really starting to get to me. My father has a heart condition and has to take meds to both keep him alive and to help his chronic pain. The downside to the meds is that he loses his filter and he says some pretty terrible things about me to my grandmother and anyone else who would listen. He is usually very smart and kind, but since I started struggling emotionally and at school he has gotten more aggressive twords me. It feels like everyone has given up on me and has no faith in me

I get constant paranoia that someone is talking about me and that they are spying on me. I hear a conversation and my brain instantly thinks that they are talking shit about me. I have to sit and convince myself that they are not talking about me so I could focus. It can get bad enough that i will start to feel paranoid completely alone

I don't have social anxiety, but I have problems talking to others about serous issues. I am a generally weak person and I get paranoia that they will attack me for having different thoughts even though I fully understand that that is irrational 

I worry that I won't be able to have kids one day out of fear of me abusing them or passing my anxiety onto them.

I get very violent thoughts about suicidal and violent actions... But I would never actually do them irl. I don't actually WANT to do any of these things, but for some reason I think about them. For example: I see you with a pencil and I might suddenly imagine you jabbing your eye out with it. This drives me nuts and makes me afraid for no reason

I fidget a lot and i have been like that since I was a little kid. I got a fidget cube and it helps when I am doing schoolwork. 

And finally: I can get an anxiety attack if triggered. I have a phobia of hospitals and death and all of that in general. I can not STAND those TV PSA's that show very graphic yet realistic images because they make me unnecessarily anxious and can trigger a panic attack. It is a little personal, but I grew up dealing with my father having multiple surgeries and constant fear of death. I remember having to call an ambulance one time because his heart stopped and he was sent to the hospital. The sheer idea of any emergencies terrifies me and I can't handle some of it. I once had a bad one and caused a nosebleed from scratching. 


Again thank you for reading what I have to say. Lately I have had the lowest self confidence and it has been harder for me to care about my future after I graduate. I feel like I am not going to make it and that the people around me would only care less what could happen to me. I am starting to lose hope.

46,"My friend (Male - 17 years) has been apparently seeing an imaginary girl for last three years. He had been hiding it up until recently when his condition started getting worse. It all started back in 2017 when he was preparing for his high school final exams. He started seeing a girl every now and then. According to him she is a young girl who follows him everywhere. Interestingly, he has never seen her face. So after a couple of months, things got better and her appearances reduced. Still he saw her once or twice every month. fast forward to 3 years later, he seems to have accepted her existence in his life. He is appearing in his College final exam this month. And things are getting worse. Earlier he didn't seem to fear her. According to him, she just sits besides him and watches him, follows him. He never felt any kind of threat due to her. That's why he didn't feel the need to tell his family or his friends about this condition. Earlier this month he was studying at his table, he looked at the door and screamed. When his parents asked repeatedly, he finally told them everything. Apparently he saw her at the door with some type of white dress and got scared. They didn't take it really seriously at first, but her appearance increased drastically. He started seeing her 2-3 times every hour. His family decided to take him to a relative for a few days. But things didn't get better. He kept seeing her everywhere. He mentions that he feels cold when she comes near him. Also I should mention here that he has severe migraine. More unusual things have started happening lately. Earlier this week, his pen disappeared from house and reappeared at school on his desk. Yesterday, he was studying and went out for a while only to come back and see ""22/01"" written on his copy on three different pages. It was written in black inked pen. HE DOESN'T OWN A BLACK PEN! He screamed in shock. His parents immediately took him to a psychiatrist. The doc says it's quite normal to have these delusions and that there's nothing to worry about. he's under medication now. The boy is totally clueless right now, and so is his family. What could be behind all this? Is he under immense stress due to his exams and thus having these delusions? Or can it be the migraine behind this? My main fear is that he's taking her as a friend who would't harm him. This cannot be good.  ",16Feb2019,2

There is a respite home for people with mental illnesses in my town, but I’m really scared to go to it. From my understanding, it’s a half way between hospital and home. You check yourself in and out. Stays range from 1-5 days 

I’ve only ever experienced psychiatric hospitals. So, if you have stayed at something like a respite house, could you please leave a recap of what your stay was like? Did it help you in the long run, and did your stay do more damage than good? What was staff like? 

Obviously I know there will be differences between the one in my area and else where... 
My main concern is my safety, and that it’s probably co-Ed. I know safety is the first priority at places like these but I don’t know if they have a lot of staff on hand or how they’d handle a conflict between two guests.  Sanitation is a big factor for me, too.

&amp;#x200B;

So about a month ago I was out drinking, to the extent of getting blackout drunk, not cool. I don't really have a drinking problem in the sense that I need to drink, it's only when I'm out with people and normally not so heavy - the issue more is that I don't have self control as to when it's time to stop. I remember sort of talking to a woman (who I have on Facebook from that night), I think I was in a sad place that evening and was talking to her about certain feelings, but I can't be certain. This has led to quite crippling anxiety over the last month, my emotional side of me is convinced I've done something abhorrent - sexual assault, actual bodily harm - something of that ilk. I've spent far too long browsing legal advice UK and the Twitter feed of the local police force to see if I appear. There is no rationale behind why I feel this way, there is nothing to suggest I've done something illegal or caused harm. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally this isn't the first time I've felt this way; I once walked out of a supermarket without paying the 20p required for the shopping bags and I was guilt ridden/paranoid about that, an acquaintance of mine was suggesting on Twitter that they've been abused before and I was guilt ridden (to the extent I went out of my way to avoid them) that I had been the abuser despite having met the person twice and having a perfectly civil conversation, I've scared myself silly that in the past I've accidentally viewed illegal material viewing porn despite using the largest/ heavily moderated website out there. My dreams allude to this sort of thing, there's been multiple times I've had a dream that when I've woken up it's taken me a few minutes to realise this isn't real and I haven't murdered someone, but the guilt and the anxiousness coming from it are perfectly tangible. I can logically derive that on the balance of probabilities I haven't done something, but emotionally I'm a wreck.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't just the only thing though that I'm trying to deal with. Five years ago my dad died of a haemorrhage caused by undiagnosed cancer which resulted in a scene that looked like something out of a chainsaw massacre film. I harbour guilt that I didn't stand up to him and try to stop him smoking, I just sat back and let it happen, thus am implicated in his death. He was survived by his mum, my gran, who mentally deteriorated quickly, had a stroke and a year after my dad's death, she passed away. I was her only surviving blood relative and as such had the responsibility to deal with that; I think that year broke me in an irreparable way. I haven't healthily processed either of their deaths, I've just shoved it down and tried to ignore it all.

&amp;#x200B;

Beyond that I do have a history of depression, although I'm not seeing anyone/ on medication etc. now, I do think I've had it for my entire adult life (I'm 29 now for context). I'm obese which is not helped by a dreadful relationship with food; I have both binge eaten and do the whole bulimia thing - the later being intermittent. I have self harmed, the last time was in April of last year. I was trying to balance a job and going back to education, I was too overwhelmed with things to be able to fully commit to either. I quit my job, but on bad terms with my employer when things got a little out of control and I found myself sinking. University I asked for a break in studies, saying I was overwhelmed with work, but in reality I was overwhelmed with myself. I have had suicidal thoughts, although I have never made an attempt. The last time I had suicidal thoughts was when I was leaving my job, but now with the whole anxiety thing, they're creeping back in. I feel confident I wouldn't do anything whilst my mum and my cats are around, but if it turns out I did do something incompatible with my own moral beliefs, then I think suicide is very likely, which is probably why I'm so anxious about things I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a good number of friends, a few of whom I've mentioned things to, but I don't want to keep digging that hole as I don't want to push people away and I don't want people to think I'm broken beyond repair. I've been single since 2012, in hindsight I think that didn't have to be the case, but my self-esteem is essentially non-existent and I find it impossible to consider I have any attractive values. People can argue that isn't true, but ultimately my perception is my reality and that's what counts. I have also had height dysphoria,  I'm short for a British male at 5'5/166cm, it doesn't bother me now and in reality I've never had an issue from it, but I once overheard two female friends talking to me about how I would be really dateable if I was a few inches taller which utterly set me off - to the extent I contacted a couple of surgeons about limb lengthening. This however is no longer an issue for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 29 now, I feel I'm at the point where I need to do something about me or else my life will be thrown away. I've done some studying over the last year, but haven't had a regular job. I have no direction or drive, I don't really want to leave the house and my bed is my safe space. I'm genuinely scared I'm broken beyond repair and that my life is heading down a route where I prematurely end it, but I also know I have so much potential and it's frustrating seeing it go to waste, even though it is in my control. I'm not really sure what my next steps are, so I guess the point of this post is to see what people think. I appreciate it's long, and if anyone has managed to make it to the end, I thank you.

59,"i’m new to reddit so hi.
a little backstory i guess: 
so recently i woke up to an anxiety attack and stayed home from school, the following days i started to feel overly tired, more than normal (i have emerging hashitoxicosis, a thyroid problem that so far has been going away with medication. so it’s normal for me to be overly tired but that day i was particularly exhausted in the morning) i ended up staying home from tuesday till friday, on thursday i went to the doctors to see if it had come back as i had not had blood tests in 6 weeks as i normally get them every 3 weeks, so we go to the dr and towards the end she has me full out a little questionaire and looks over my answers, she says that i probably have severe anxiety and i almost cry because 2 years prior i had said to my mom that i had an anxiety attack and it wasn’t the first time, she just said i was stressed because she is a die hard christian and can’t accept that her child has something wrong with her oh no, god wouldn’t do that. i almost cried right there because now i was getting some solid proof from a professional that i had anxiety, she has recommended that i right down every time i have a bad thought and then bring her the list in a week and she will prescribe me a therapist. when doing the test it was to do with everything in the last 2 weeks and that stood out to me because i had been watching videos about “do i have anxiety, do i have depression” and in some videos they say of symptoms have continued for more than 3 weeks, some say more than 2 weeks and so i thought this would be if i had depression or anxiety and was on the verge of tears because i keep my feelings bottled up and i don’t need people asking about all my worries or anything but it was only for anxiety. dr said that stress leads to anxiety and depression is common with anxiety, on my dads side my gran suffered from depression and so does my aunt. (i’m crying writing this because it’s the first time i’ve talked about my feelings) and i have thought about killing myself before, about how i would do it, about what would be in my suicide letter, the quickest most painfree way but the thing that has been holding me back is my parents, i couldn’t leave them, they would be devastated, if they died i would kill myself, nothing more to live for, (my parents are both in their 50s ) last night at around 2 am i was still awake as i struggle to sleep, i was walking around my room and saw a hair tie, all i could think about was if i could put it around my neck and go to sleep, would i die in my sleep, would it be painless, i started crying, sometimes i cry for no reason and then think about everything i’m anxious about, i’m scared to write about every time i have a negative thought, there is so much stigma about depression in my school and my friends would probably abandon me or talk to me less if they found out about this and then i would have less to live for i only feel really happy when i talk to my friends or when i cuddle my rabbit who i love so much, once i ate almost nothing for a week because me siblings mock me for being overweight because i eat to cope with everything, i eat to cope with feelings and boy do i have a lot of those so when i wasn’t eating, they mocked me for not eating, for being skinnier so i at more because i was sad and i hate having showers because i can’t stand looking at myself and how much of a disgrace i am, one of the things i can do that let me relax, make me forget everything is painting.

I can't stand people who act smart ass or who have an opinion different from mine, as a result of this, I have fought with a lot of my good friends and have started ignoring their calls simply because I can't stand them. 
I get frustrated if any conversation with my parents or people around me gets extended, I find ways to shun people off my vicinity. 

However, this is not the case with my boyfriend. I fight with him because I feel he doesn't pay much attention to me or even when the circumstances are odd, I simply reject them and start blaming him, followed by shouting and crying. I say bad things like blaming him for ruining my happiness. And moment after I blurt it out, I feel extremely guilty and start crying in restlessness and helplessness. 

He has been very supportive and just moves on the whole matter, but things I say, hurt him and I don't wanna ruin the thing we have. 

I am heavily burdened with my professional career right now, I have to get into a good university for PhD and all. He and my parents are the only place where I find peace. I am scared of ruining my relationship and being alone. 

Other than that, I am a kleptomaniac. I shoplift things from supermarket and give it away to my friends. I steal useless things and repetitive things. Like if I like a pen , I'll visit the store every now and then and pick up till I feel a mental satisfaction. I don't feel bad about it. I have no regrets or guilt. But I wanna overcome it. Because it's stealing and it might put me or people around me in trouble. 

My sleeping pattern is fucked up as well. I sleep a lot. I just don't feel like getting out of bed. Bunk my work and stay in bed and regret in the evening for wasting the day. And I cry to sleep, it has become a routine nowadays. I start feeling bad about a lot of things at once and it makes me even more restless.

If you wish to take part, please email S6015890@tees.ac.uk to receive the information sheet and the consent form which will need to be completed and sent back electronically. 

To take part in this study, participants will be asked to write a piece around why they use mental health self-help forums or blogs. It will need to include why they are used, how/if they are helpful/unhelpful, whether it is used for support (either for yourself or others), is it for sharing experiences etc. Any other information you feel relevant is also welcome and encouraged. This response can either be emailed to S6015890@tees.ac.uk or replied to in this thread, whichever you prefer. 

All data collected will remain fully confidential, no personal details such as your name/age will be used; pseudonyms will be used to ensure confidentiality. Participants must be over 18 to take part, and must not be currently experiencing any mental health issues (you must be in recovery/recovered).

In today’s world, [health and nutrition](http://autoinsurancenem.info) have gained most of the focus. Health is always hard to maintain which results in a harmful attack of different diseases. Most of the diseases lead to the extinction of life. The basic need is to have proper nutrition. In order to achieve proper health and nutrition, it is very important to focus on what you eat. The people are more involved in the work that they eat just to satisfy their hunger. Most of the people in today’s world are unaware of the nutritive value of their food. The instant food which is very appealing is actually destroying people health as there is nutritional content present in such food.

I'm really struggling lately thinking about things that happened years ago ago and feel guilty. I want to apologize and make admendants but am concerned it will only make things worse for bringing up past events...I don't want to upset the person who said he has moved on from the incident, however we don't talk anymore. I feel trapped and have a pit in my stomach a lot of the time.

On top of this the way I'm viewing the guilt is that I must apologize for every thing that happened between us or otherwise it will not be okay. On top of this I've developed a fear of guilt and if I do things, then I must apologize otherwise I will not be able to function even although it may be out of context or not needed. My mind just needs to apologize or I will feel trapped.

I can’t/don’t want to be here anymore. I lost my only two friends who I thought were my family due to 1 of them breaking into my room and moving all my stuff out so i left the flat that i found for us and the other trying to get into my boyfriend while i was in the shower. I was raised by a narcissistic and a drunk of a mother who did nothing but complain about my weight and try and fight us mentally of physically which last year i lost 40+ kgs due to anxiety and not wanting to eat. I don’t talk to any of my family nor do they live in the same city as me. My dad has never been there for me and when he first found out i was depressed he said i was attention seeking. My two older brothers are legally blind so i had to help them so much (i am not bothered and willing to help but it didn’t help me have a normal childhood) and I basically had to raise my younger bother who would just anger my mum by calling her a drunk all the time. Last year I got really into meth and coke after spending a few years taking a lot of acid and smoking weed. I cannot hold down a job for the life of me and also sold my body for drug, and have tired to get help but i was told i need more therapy for them to help me get a job but i need a job to pay for therapy. My only friend is my flat mate who (is only friends with me bc we fuck) and was friends with my abusive ex boyfriend who locked me in his house and garage a few time and the first time i tired to break up with him he choked me out but since i had such low self confidence i kept going back to him for three years and he kept treating me like shit and spending all my money putting me in debt and giving me a bad social credit which i cant get rid of. I tried to end my life in November 2017 where i hooked up a hose to my car and took sleeping pills but said abusive ex bf rang me and wanted me to drive 30+ mins to him so he could watch me die, instead i blacked out and drove and crashed my car ending up in the hospital. I wish i did die then and there because everything has been horrible since. My old ex best friend cheating 10+ times on her ex and made me lie and used me to lie which i feel guilty about everyday my other ex boyfriend who i thought was very against cheating used me to cheat on his now gf so i feel guilty about that and i told her which gave me bad anxiety I’ve been vomiting for three days. Nothing gives me joy and i just have such bad depression i don’t even shower. I just quit my first job that i got in over two years after only two weeks working because i was having mental breakdowns everyday. I hate who i am and what i look like (i have a nice body and face which causes a lot of older men to stare at me and makes me feel dirty) in the last 5 months i have barely left my house. I am angry at everything in my life the anger alone makes me what to kill myself as I dislike being angry and I cannot control myself anymore is getting more and more out of hand. Nothing bring me joy and all I think about is everything bad that i have done or bad thing that i have gone through. I believe that i am the issue with all of my relationships and friendships don’t last or work out.

You just want the day to end, but it never does. You want to sleep, but you can't. You want to stop thinking, but you can't.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be gone. I want to take off my skin, take off my flesh like it's a coat. I'm uncomfortable in my own body. I want to leave this vessel for the time being. I want to be alone. Go to a small island in the middle of the ocean all on my own. Stay until this ends or until the day I die. I want to pick up the pieces but can't. I know they're scattered around here somewhere, I just don't know where. Kind of like dropping a brown bead on a wooden floor. The bead and floor blend, become one. I know where the it fell, I just don't see it. It's hiding in plane sight. I'm looking right at it and don't even know it. I can't focus on it long enough to see where the bead ends, and when the floor starts. I feel so close but I can never quite get there.

77,"My boyfriend has a confirmed psychosomatic disorder. He went to the doctor and did all the tests required. All came back negative. In despair, his doc prescribed him Amitriptyline, which worked and gave him back an admirable quality of life.

However, instead of using this gain to seek therapy so he can end his suffering for good, he's been using the ""I feel good now, why would I go to therapy?"" angle to justify not going. He has told me multiple times that he will do it but he never does.

Lately he has started getting psychosomatic symptoms, different ones, and they seem to conveniently flare up every week when it is time to do the laundry.

His arguments against it are the costs, the energy it takes to go and the fact that his previous experiences with therapy were very meh.

But if he doesn't go, the only solution for him to stop having these flares is for me to take on all of the tasks related to household chores (and I'm sick too, I have fibromyalgia).

I just don't know what to tell him anymore. I'm tempted to give him $500 of my savings so he can pay for his therapy and no longer has money as an excuse, but I know he will never accept it.

I appreciate any advice, thanks for reading.",16Feb2019,2
78,"for the past couple of months, i’ve started getting really angry and abusive with myself, again. last year at around thanksgiving and december, i was cutting myself almost everyday out of self hatred and anger. i stopped in march of last year, but it seems that i’ve circled back to hurting myself. it’s not as extreme as it was then, but i punch myself several times a day over the most minute things. i do it whenever i get frustrated with myself, meaning that it happens in public too. when i do something i feel is stupid or doesn’t make sense, i get this untamable urge to hit myself, so i do. sometimes i punch myself, slap myself, or hit myself with an object like a wooden brush. i have to constantly fight the urge to hurt myself, and catch myself physically holding my hand down from doing so. i don’t know the direct cause of this, but i just want to know how to calm this down or if i should take anger management classes? i just want this to stop because my head feels sore sometimes from all the punches.

80,"The last days I've more less been trying to come to terms with my childhood being... not very picturebook-like and that the symptoms i suffer from today can mostly be very much linked back to stuff in my childhood/early teens.
The thing that i noticed now is just: Usually when I read about trauma there's this one abuser, who's the...absolute bad person and who did this stuff to you and are just kinda evil for that. (very simplified, of course it's always more complex than that). 

In my case it's my mother who had really bad depression when i was younger (as far as i can remember, it's all a big blur for me) and neglected me, put her emotions above mine, always, and i basically had to care for her as a child. 
And of course all that was fucked up in handsight, but as much as i wanna be angry at her for putting me into this position that until now affected me so much - i just can't? because i still love her and i get how horrible she must have felt during that time.
And i know she never meant to hurt me - so, whenever i even try to acknowledge how painful it has been for me, i immediately feel incredibly guilty because that also requires me to acknowledge that she has fucked up a lot, and that she hurt me. And i just...i don't even in my mind wanna paint her as the bad guy in that because it feels wrong, i struggle recognizing it as any form of trauma or something because it would mean that she's somehow..the 'evil' one, and above all - all i wanna do is still ...just help her.

Anyways, that was a lot more than i intended to write (guess i just had to get it out of my system):D

What i really wanted to ask is just: Does anyone of you experience something similar? 
Feeling super guilty and ashamed even just admitting to yourself that something might be considered as traumatic/abuse/whatever, because that person didn't possibly wanna hurt you and therefore you 'simply can't be angry at them' or anything?

81,"I broke up with my ex a while back, she has been very depresssed before we were dating and during the time that we were, she talks about suicide sometime. She hasn't done it because she's still alive nor hospitalized. After we broke up she thinks that I somehow hate her now (I don't hate her, we broke up because of reasons on my side) and that her best friends for years hate her as well. She recently was texting me and was implying heavily that she was involved with drugs and alcohol. She told me later that she doean't take drugs but I'm doubtful on that. She tells me that she has a psychiatrist but I don't believe that because I tried to get her to go to one before and.she got really pissed instead of just telling me that she has one. 

She thinks that she doesn't have a meaning in life and that her being dead would just help her parents financially so they don't waste money on her (she has other physical diseases which require medicines that she doesn't take because she thinks that shes gonna die anyways). When ever she talks about suicide and then later the suicide situation gets resolved she'd say some very not practical goals to stay alive with such as haven't watched the fourth avengers movie.

Her friends and I tried to talk to her and tell her that we don't actually hate her. We just don't want to see her doing the wrong thing and truly wants to help her. She doesn't get that. How can we help her even though she doesn't want help? And the 'psychiatrist' that she's got is probably more fictional than vaccines causing autism!

88,"I was diagnosed with depression as a child and I’ve been on and off medication ever since. I thought it was time to officially revisit the diagnosis because it left a lot of behaviours and mental health challenges in my life unexplained. I finally worked up the courage to ask my doctor for a referral to a psychiatrist last year, anniversary of the appointment was Valentines Day.

As soon as I sit down the psychiatrist tells me how he doesn’t want to be there, he’s doing a favour for the hospital, he’s a very important person, and he’ll only see me for this one session. Which, okay, lets get into it then.

He asks a few questions, some weirder than others. I found them to be leading questions rather than open, and then arguing with my answers for a while asking me “are you sure? Because a lot of people...” Yes, I’m sure.

At the end of maybe a half hour conversation he said to double my medication, that no I’ll never be able to be off medication, and to “watch out” for bipolar without explaining what to look for. Most of what I’d discussed with him was my anxiety, because that was the biggest non-explained aspect of the depression diagnosis. But he didn’t address that at all, he was already getting up to leave when I had to say “but what about the anxiety” and his reply was “oh, yeh, try to figure out what makes you anxious and fix that.”

He passed along a dysthymia diagnosis to my doctor. Which I’d accept if it weren’t missing a lot of what we talked about - non functioning weeks (no energy or desire for showers, living in filth), constant anxiety and almost daily hyperventilation attacks at the time, chest pains, anxious puking, breathing problems (air hunger), constant fatigue to the point of missing work for weeks at a time, loss of interest in hobbies, a lifetime pattern of erratic self destructive behaviours. I don’t “look” like your typical anxious or depressed person, is that it?

If the diagnosis was “less than” clinical depression then why’d you try to double my medication and tell me I’ll never be able to be off of them? 

What did you mean “watch out” for bipolar?

You went to how many years of school to say things like “oh yeh, try to find what makes you anxious and stop doing that.” 

It just left me feeling unheard, invalidated, and defeated. And here I am almost exactly a year later still thinking about it. Is it worth getting a second opinion or do I just take what I get and learn to deal with my behaviours and moods without a diagnosis?",16Feb2019,3

But a backstory on me: I come from a terrible childhood, I was molested, abused, ignored, and I grew up to have bulimia, bipolar disorder and depression. The bulimia is gone, but needless to say I still have A LOT of issues. 

He on the other hand is good. Clean and taken care of since he was a baby. He comes from an amazing/non scandalous family. He like expensive things and its hard for him to understand mental disorders. But he does try. 

These are some reasons why Ive decided to break up&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

1.) Anyways we were suppose to move in together next year, until he decided to lease an insanely expensive apartment about 80 miles away from where I live. He got that apartment because its closer to work. 

Which is understandable however, if he knew I was going to move in with him next year why on Earth choose a place that I cant afford, bot even close. He told me its because ""it was the nicest one"".... So this leads me to believe not once did he think of me during his apartment hunting. 

2.) He has little empathy/or doesnt know how to comfort me when I am going through bipolar depression. We were on the phone Friday night and I was crying, I was upset and freaking out about my dad being in a semi truck accident and he says ""I need to get ready for bed"". During my depression I need to talk to someone and Ive realized that he cant be my someone and idk what to do. 

Does anyone have any advice for me? He tends to not text me back whenever Im in a bad/depressed mood so talking to him rn isnt possible. 

TL;DR: My boyfriend has had a good life and he doesnt understand my mental disorders and we want different things in life. I'm not sure if breaking up with him is just me running away from love or if we are actually not compatible.

Mental illness can be treated. This means that many people who have a mental illness, and are treated, recover well or even completely. However, because there are many different factors contributing to the development of each illness, it can sometimes be difficult to predict how, when, or to what degree someone is going to get better. The treatment depends on the type of mental illness you are experiencing and how strong it is and what is best for you. The combination of treatments works well in many cases.

My parents got into a fight in either October or November about politics. They are both republican but have conflicting views on trump. After their fight they didn’t talk with each other for about two months. During this time I was in college so I didn’t have much contact with my dad. Then in December my dad faked a suicide attempt while drunk. My mom heard a gun shot, ran out and started screaming when she saw my dad laying on the ground. She thought he was dead but couldn’t find any blood. After figuring out he was faking it my mom tried to run from him. He chased her around the house and my mom tried to grab the gun to hide it somewhere. My dad got to it first and then proceeded to walk to his car with his gun. My mom convinced him to get back in the house and he whispered to her “don’t worry I would never do anything that would make you look bad.” She was terrified and hid in the bathroom all day. 

Later after our work she called my brother and I and we were in shock. I didn’t know whether to believe my dad was truIy suicidal or he did that to manipulate and scare my mom. So I did what I thought was best and called my closest uncle to ask if he could help, but he proceeded to say that, “you know women of that race (referring to my mom) tend to make people crazy.” I decided to ignored that because I’m my mother’s child and a women therefore a “woman of that race.” My uncle promised me he would visit my dad the next day since it was late. My brother and I left work and headed over to my parents’ place. 

When we got there we all sat at the table and talked. My brother and I thought our dad might be suicidal so we tried to reassure him that we were there for him if he needed to talk. He then told us that he was suicidal and never planned on shooting himself, he just wanted to know if my mother still loved him. He said that he knew his methods were wrong but that was the only way he could find out what he needed to know. My mom was still in shock and after hours of talking to the both of them, I decided it was best to take my mom to my boyfriend’s apartment to stay the night. (Also my uncle never visited my dad)

After that incident it’s been a crazy spiral downward. My mom decided the best thing she could do was get away from him for awhile. But soon after my dad harassed us at our work, threatening to break everything. After that we saw on his search history that he bought a gps car tracker, ran background checks on my mom, and  
hired a private investigator. My brother and I still tried to visit him after but every time we did he was adamant that he did nothing wrong, that he was not crazy, and my brother and I were wrong for treating him like he was. With all of this I decided to take this semester off from college.   

After a couple of weeks my mom decided it was best to move forward with a divorce. Ever since then I haven’t contacted my dad. But he has sent me numerous messages. He threatened to take away my car, told me I need to pay his parent loans, and more. 

I think there is something wrong with my dad. He may have been extreme with his opinions but he’s never done anything this crazy. But he won’t go to a doctor or a therapist and he won’t listen to me.

100,"Hi.
I’m a teen female living in Texas. 
About 4 years ago, I met this guy online. We dated for a few weeks (long distance). We both lived in California during that time so we planned on meeting up and having sex. We lived like 2 hours away from each other. But on  February, out of nowhere I ended the relationship. I didn’t realize what I did hurt me until a few weeks after the pain finally hit me. I couldn’t stop thinking about him. I would stalk his social media everyday and cry a lot as well. I regretted the mistake so much and what I think made me end the relationship with him was the fact that I’m insecure and ugly. Who knows, maybe he would stop liking me after he met me in real life. Anyway, the pain ate me up. I was miserable and tried my best not feel this pain. My best friend was so fed up with me telling me, “he was just a boy you met online, get over it.” 
I knew deep down I was being ridiculous but I only wanted him. 
One day I asked my best friend to text him and to flirt with him. After attempting, he quickly alerted her, that he had a girlfriend. I was hurt and mad. I kept crying and crying at her house. I cried myself to sleep. (Even thinking about it makes me cringe. I just wish I kept to myself.) After 2 years of pain and heartbreak, the pain turned into numbness. I still thought about him everyday, even after I dated a few guys. The relationships weren’t that serious either. I wasn’t in a rush to be in a relationship and assume it would take away my heartbreak. Although I felt this pain and had these repetitive thoughts, I knew I wouldn’t get rid of the pain with someone else. 
But everyday I think about him. Now present day, I live in Texas. I moved a few months ago but, I’m moving back to California. I still think about him
I’m happy to love back. I’ve been miserable here. 
I told my parents about the city in which he lives in. (My parents don’t know about him, but I did tell them I knew someone who lives there.)
It’s a very cheap part of California in the middle of the desert and maybe they’d take interest in moving there even though my parents have talked about it for years moving there. And now… we finally are. Some of my extended family are going to live there too. I’m not heartbroken anymore but, I think about him everyday still. I don’t even know, but if I move there I want to meet him. I know where he lives. I’ve done way too much stalking on his social media. His mom actually posted their address once by accident on Instagram and I got it. I was thinking of walking by his house one day and try to talk to him.. and all and if I could get his number. I don’t think he’ll recognize me from photos I’ve sent of myself four years ago. I don’t think he remembers me at all.  I have different colored hair, dress differently and wear makeup now. 
I don’t know why I’m obsessed with him and really want to talk him. I’ve planned everything I want to do when I live near him. I have no intentions in hurting him in real life… I don’t know. But all my teen years have been thinking about this boy. 
I just really want him for myself. 
He broke up with his girlfriend so I feel like I have a shot. 


PLUS. While my time in Texas, I told my friends about him. I pretended that he was my boyfriend who lives in California and missed me and always rushed me to go back to him. 
I only pretended because I dated some guy in Texas and I wanted to prove that I moved on from him so he could get jealous and hurt. 
I pretended to be him and texted some of my friends.

I’ve been dating my boyfriend for a few months now, and I’ve finally gotten to a point where I’ve tried to open up about some of the shit I’ve gone through. However, he just doesn’t get it. He thinks that medication is terrible and a cop-out, depressed people are just ungrateful for the good in their lives and need to snap out of it, suicidal people are evil because of all the people they hurt with their death, etc etc. I’ve tried to explain to him that this just isn’t how it works, but he firmly believes that he’s right and I should be able to go off my medication and quit therapy because I say he makes me so happy. And he does make me happy. 

I love this guy, but I’m worried that this could be a serious dealbreaker if/when my depression flares up again.

102,"It has been months since my girlfriend of three years shocked me and broke up with me. In the weeks before, her behaviour had been erratic. I loved her so tolerated the stuff as much as I could and anytime I stood up against It even in a mild way I was blamed as if I were causing damage. Things were off and I tried to be a good boyfriend and was always there, but confusingly she would oscillate between angry and unappreciative of me, and loving, all over me. Just before the break up I was told that she loved and missed me.

There had been times before, a previous break up where I was blindsided and told that she didn't feel the same way for me. I endured hell during those cold times only for a few months later to be told that she loved me madly, and not only wanted to marry me, but that It was inevitable. I made the mistake to let all the rocky times pass (there were others but I'll not go on too long) and hope this was just a temporary glitch. I see now with hindsight that I was always making excuses for the behaviour and she was always the victim. 

I never knew anything about BDP. I'm not sure exactly if she has BDP but It seems to fit most closely. I was ignorant, thinking people were like me, that if you love someone, then you have nothing to worry about and just relax because the future will happen. We really seemed perfect for each other and were best friends and seemed like we would marry and start a family. Such dumb and fickle little arguments happened and I went for being adored, to feeling like I'm a creep to her. Whereas she seemed in love with me, both in words and in body language one moment, the next, after the break up, when I called her I was made to feel like my innocous questions were stalkerish. 

She listed back the problems that she had. I'd seen It before. And blaming me for things that in reality she was the one who did those things. And rewriting all our history. Here I am now with such pain, craving to be together and wondering how someone who wanted a future together, consistantly for years, now sees what? All the daily ""I love yous"" and plans for the future, are replaced with what?

My spirit is crushed. On a rational level I can acknowledge that I was a great, loving boyfriend who offered everything year after year, and have been betrayed, and also mistreated without remorse at times during our relationship. But I haven't been able to make much progess on my emotional trauma. It's there all day, every day. I can't find joy and I'm living in the past. Also I can't seem to accept reality, my mind is still desperately hoping she'll flip back like before and text saying she misses me.

The last weeks together were not always ideal. But really that's not my fault. She blamed everything on me and then refused to talk about It. So maybe all the wonderful majority we had is reduced to some fickle moments. ",16Feb2019,1

104,"Most of my life (I’m 30) I’ve struggled with anxiety; depression has joined the party more recently. I am in therapy and have a great support system but I hate how both anxiety &amp; depression still manage to surprise me, especially when it comes to physical symptoms. I’ve had heart palpitations for years and other stuff related to anxiety - tingling hands, indigestion, etc. But the past two weeks I’ve had constant body aches. Like how I usually feel when I have a fever but...no fever. Just aches, lack of energy, and increased appetite. I went to my doctor yesterday and she’s going to run some labs but I honestly think it may be depression related...does anyone else deal with symptoms like this? How do you deal with them? And how do you know when you’re actually sick? ",16Feb2019,1
105,"I met my ex over a year and a half ago. And we instantly connected. I thought she was incredibly beautiful and amazing, and for the first time someone thought the same thing about me. I was in total bliss. The problem was that she was a single mom with two kids and rarely had time for me.  I understood her kids came first but the limitation she put on herself didn’t allow are relationship to really develop. So  reluctantly broke things off. I ended up trying to work things out with her but she was upset at me for being so quick to end things. Fast forward 8 months later we reconnect and decide to give it another shot to see if we could make things work, but unfortunately it was just the same thing, which to her credit she warned me about. We agreed that the relationship just seemed like it was dragging on. She apologized for not being there for me and not giving me 100% 

Anyways I’ve been unable to move on from her. Our relationship wasn’t the best and wasn’t very long, but the mark she left on me was huge. I’ve been trying to move forward and casually date, but I’m constantly thinking about her. I also struggle to feel confident and like I’m worth anything. I question wether I was good enough or attractive enough. 
I sit with this hole in my chest. I wish things could’ve worked out, but it’s over and I try to accept it...but I can’t.  I can’t move on. 

I fear I’ll never be good enough for anyone or meet someone as beautiful as she was to me. ",16Feb2019,1
106,"Before anyone starts with the ""get help, exhaust all your options"" thing, I've done that. I've gone to a psychiatrist, been medicated, gone through every antipsychotic they could offer, been hospitalised, in therapy, nothing's worked and eventually I gave up on the mental health system. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for something like this, probably not, but it feels sort of like a confession so I'm going to post it here anyway, feel free to downvote to your heart's content. A month ago, my boyfriend left me because of my mental illness. Saying I wasn't the woman he fell in love with anymore, that I'd never inspired him, never made him a better person, that I'd never given him anything besides trying to kill myself. And then he moved on within a week. And I haven't even come close. I've tried to live in denial, telling myself I have friends, I don't need him, I'll find someone else. He was the first man I'd ever loved, my first relationship, my first kiss. I know this sounds ridiculous, but I truly thought he was the one. I have borderline personality disorder, which makes interpersonal relationships extremely hard to keep healthy and alive. Our relationship was on and off, difficult, breaking up every month, not talking for six months, out of the blue one of us calls the other and we can't be apart. I'd spend weeks at a time at his house. I know that he truly cared about me. And I cared about him. I was so in love. And I was only falling harder and harder. I wanted to spend my entire life with him. I knew that that was hardly possible, given that we were 17, it had only been three years and he was my first boyfriend, but I pushed that thought deep inside and denied its existence. And then he left. I know I'm gonna get judged for this, but I can't carry on living without him. He was my everything. And I know for a fact that it's no one's fault but my own that I've lost him. If I'd just pretended to be fine, if I'd just sucked it up and stopped being so dramatic and making it all about myself, he wouldn't have gone. On February 3rd, my mum died. I messaged him on Reddit (he'd blocked me everywhere else, saying he might be back in a few years, once I'm better) to tell him. I then asked him to return my clothes since it'd been a month and I'd asked him multiple times. I asked him to knock at my window, like he always used to do when he'd drop by, so I could see him because I really needed support regarding my mother's death. He hit my window once and walked away. He doesn't care anymore. I'd be worried about hurting him, but he's given me no reason to be. So I've decided to end it here. I'm going to draw a bath tonight when my grandma and my sister have gone to bed and either slit my wrists or drown myself. I can't tell any of my friends because I know they'll call the police and that's not what I want. Every suicide attempt I've had in the past I've made the mistake of telling someone and it always resulted in me being taken to the ER and then to the psych ward. That's not what I want to happen this time. I've had enough and I want it to be over. I hate having to leave my closest friends behind without any kind of warning or sentimental message or anything of that kind but I can't risk anyone finding out. That's why I'm posting this here, to get it off my chest, to leave anyone who should find it with \*something\*.

111,"I get so lost in my thoughts these days. I have great, wonderful, intelligent thoughts and I also have stupid, bitter, angry, ignorant thoughts... i used to be so motivated, i was in college, ready to live a happy life but even in the times I was doing good, the worst of my thoughts creep in. I’ve always picked my skin and have scarring on my arms and body and I can’t stop thinking about how I can never take my shirt off in front of a girl anymore. I slit my forearms longways in a mad drug fueled suicide attempt and have a shitty tat covering one side and the other is tattooless because of how shitty the first cover up attempt went. My teeth are getting so bad from grinding and my gums are receeding from bad oral hygiene (it’s gotten better but still dealing with recession). It all went downhill after college, I had to move back in with my parents, along with my brother who was/is addicted to several drugs mostly crack. This was 3 years ago. We fought and a certain fight with him triggered my first and only attempts. My dad and I have always had a rough relationship which got worse and worse after college. My brother began stealing and eventually got into a fight  with dad which got him arrested. I can only talk to my mom about things. I just can’t talk to my dad because we always fight. My dad called the cops on my once because I said I wanted to kill myself and I ran away and was eventually thrown into a mental health facility because I said the wrong words at the wrong time. I feel like I can only apply to jobs that allow me to wear long sleeves because of my scars and shit tat. Everything is a mess. I also smoke weed all the time every time I get a chance, that’s not me bragging in any way whatsoever. I know it’s not addictive but I am addicted. I’m addicted to skin picking, smoking weed, and self loathing. If I had 20 dollars for gas I would put 10 in my tank and use 10 to buy weed. My parents aren’t much help anymore. Not because they don’t try but because they just don’t have any more ability anymore, they’re trying to deal with my brother and the grandkids and they’re graciously allowing me to stay with them. All this to say, I get so angry all the time now, it’s not that I don’t want change. I try but I just get so frustrated like it’s deep. It’s this shame that hits me when any little thing goes wrong and I just shut down. Also I’ve been going to a psych the past few years and was prescribed many different antidepressants, the first few a tried made me so angry that I can’t even describe it. I would be driving in traffic and want to run Into the back of people not going fast enough, I had to have weed to chill out.  I was on a ssri medication during my attempt and hospitalization.  Some of them helped but I could never relax I was so hyped up. Also I feel a lot better off them except when I dont smoke. I know I have to stop smoking but I smoke to kill my shame and I have so much shame from what I’ve become. We’ve never been very well off, I never went without but we couldn’t afford things like braces. I can fill in more details for anybody with any advice on how to move forward. I would love t get back into college but it seems so daunting. Please don’t take this next sentence as me thinking I’m smarter or that I’m super paranoid but, I just don’t trust my psych anymore. She talks over me and I’m too ashamed to even tell her about my cuts on my arms, I’ve always worn long sleeves. I tell her all the time how much I smoke weed and she barely ever acknowledges it as a problem.

112,"I’m not sure I’ll be able to explain this in any way that makes sense, but I’ll try my best.
Btw I’m F21
So this past year has probably been the worst year of my life. I’ve been more depressed than I ever have been. I’ve had a lot of really bad financial problems( like my car brakes went out and I couldn’t afford to fix them), I also failed almost all of my classes this past year, and my dog (who helped me through some of my worst times) passed away. On top of all of this my mom (who I live with because I can’t afford to live anywhere else) has been especially awful.
We’ll start with college. I failed almost all of my classes this year because I couldn’t get out of bed to make it to my classes on time. I would sleep through alarms. Also the only way I could get to classes was to take my moms car, which meant I had to get up even earlier, take her to work, and then go wait for my classes to start. I also have had a hard time thinking straight, like when it came to assignments. Like it came to a point where I would start an assignment and I would get really confused or couldn’t think and had to stop. I had to drop out this semester because I was doing so badly and I needed a student loan and couldn’t find a co-signer. 
My mom has also given me until May to move out. I don’t currently have a job, plus not many people are hiring. She doesn’t seem to understand that the best job I’ll probably get is a part-time minimum wage where I won’t be able to afford and apartment/ food/ bills. She also told me she doesn’t care if I’m homeless (which is the second time I’ve been told that-the first was my grandma) and said she didn’t care if she had to call the cops to get me out of the house (which is the second time she’s said that to me, the first time I was 16). I hate being around her because all she ever talks about is how I’m not applying to jobs (which I am), or how she can’t wait until I’m gone. Part of me feels like she only wants me gone because I am not giving her any money ( I have given her over $5,000 in the last 2 years which is a year of my college tuition). She also doesn’t believe that I have OCD or anxiety. Her and my sister often make fun of me for it, like if we are out in public and one of them has to do something by themselves they’ll joke about how they have anxiety and need someone to go with them. What’s worse is she has a Bachelor’s degree in psychology. She is always insinuating that I am the reason for her problems, like a few weeks ago she blamed me for her defaulting on her credit card. We’ve started family therapy but we’ve only gone to like 2 sessions and now she keeps canceling appointments. 
I can’t go see my therapist because I owe the company $200 because I accidentally went to an appointment in between insurances ( I didn’t have insurance for like a week when I was switched because I got dropped by one. My mom knew this and didn’t tell me and of course I went to an appointment in between them) and they won’t take my new insurance for it since “I wasn’t covered when I went”.
I really don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m stuck and I’m having a really hard time doing anything. I’ve stopped taking care of my self (I can’t bring myself to do it any more). I’m tired all the time and am in a constant state of panicking. I really don’t know what to do any more. I don’t know if there is even anything that can be done (other than me just being homeless).

113,"   We can start with some reactions to people I've talked to here on reddit. One guy is a mental health professional who seems like he want's to help but he's very flaky. He's also having me read some how to control your anger book. Funny enough both of these things made me angry and I went off on him telling him he must really suck at his job and all that. But that's not that bad. Because there's another guy who tried talking to me for a bit funny enough after I went off on him about how stupid his advice is. He kept sending me videos from Jordan Peterson. I got so bored, and that guy trails off a lot and doesn't offer advice, just facts we already know if we have mental illnesses. I started messaging this guy about how stupid the videos are, and how stupid he is for watching them. That made him pretty upset. And I must have gotten some kind of high off of it because I went off on him some more. He told me some things about his life earlier and I used those things against him. I told him I hope he gets injured at his job. I don't feel bad. I'd like to go off on him some more. And this morning I made the mistake of logging on to reddit. I ended up encouraging someone to self harm. Why the hell would I do that? I don't know but it must have felt great. Because I kept doing it. And the hell of it is? I don't feel bad. Only reason I'm upset is because I got blocked and cant do it anymore.   
   I guess a small part of me cares, considering I'm posting this. And I'm normally not even like this. If anyone were to meet me in person, or other social media, we'd probably get along.

This isn’t some copy and paste message but I want to spread this so if you feel the need to put this somewhere else, please link it to this comment so they can find my username. 

I’ve been on 15 different medications for my mental health, tried 4 different therapists, done CBT, ERP, talk therapy, TMS, exercise (calisthenics, powerlifting, bodybuilding, rock climbing, track and field, soccer, baseball, basketball, white water rafting, zip lining, anything and everything), taken vitamins and herbal supplements (folic acid, d3, fish oil, b12, ashwaghanda, CBD oil (it’s legal in all 50 US states if it’s from a hemp plant), etc), researched every religion under the sun, music therapy, creating art (poetry, photography, painting, writing songs), hobbies (reading, writing, debate, personal training, etc).

To the people who are suffering, please read the following if you have the time.

Amongst the general population, some people suffer from a chronic negative thought pattern. Amongst those people, some suffer from clinical depression. Amongst those, some suffer from mild or greater depression. Amongst those, some suffer from moderate or greater depression. This is followed by severe depression, which is followed by Treatment Resistant Depression, which is followed by the people who are 100% truly treatment resistant, followed by those who could try every treatment the doctors can offer and don’t see relief. I want people to realize that this is such a small portion of the population and that even if your current treatment isn’t working, there is always a possibility for a treatment that will. Don’t die before you can find a treatment that works. It might only be months or weeks or days away from reaching the public and more specifically, you. Hold on to that hope as long as you can.

If you need to, try CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) with a therapist who you can trust and who you find generally makes you feel better during your sessions, try TMS (transcranial magnetic stimulation) if your insurance allows it, try medicine. Try lifestyle changes that you know will make you a better person and feel better over time. Try whatever you think will work for you. Take care of yourself how you can and when you can. 

Even if you try one therapist and it doesn’t work, even after you’ve given it a few months, try another. Even if your SSRI hasn’t helped at all after 3 months or more, try a SNRI, or a Tricyclic Antidepressant, or an atypical antidepressant. Try every combination of every possible treatment you can get your hand on (granted it’s safe and effective) before you let yourself give up hope completely. There will be days where you think nothing will change and your treatment isn’t working and you’ll want to die. There will be days where you walk out of your doctors office and say “Life has the ability to get so much better”. There will be days in between. Do what you can, when you can, while you can. 

You can do this.",16Feb2019,49

117,"Background:I have ADD,Bipolar Disorder NOS, Anxiety, depression, and Asperger's/Autism

So this mental health center I go to goes through many psychiatrists(I'm guessing because they are nonprofit,and most go to where they can make more money) Usually since I had been stable on my medication regimen for a long time,the appointments are(usually) more checking in to see if they are still working,so even if they are terrible I wouldn't have had an issue because everything was the same. 

So my mental health center had switched me to a new psych(technically she's a nurse practitioner??for some reason???) and at the time I was at Celexa 60mg,and she lowered it to 40 due to new regulations due to the risk of long QT syndrome.Fair enough, my heart had been feeling screwy for about a month anyway, and after lowering that cleared up for a couple months. So my Regimen was Adderall XR 20mg, Modafinil 200mg, Celexa 40mg, and Carbamazepine 100mg.  

Then the tachycardia came back worse then ever, now with my heart feeling like it was ""flopping"" in my chest. So fearing after being on Celexa for so long at a high dose it did something with my heart, and noting it got worse at night after I had taken it, I cut it on my own to 20mg. That helped with the flopping a bit, but not the tachycardia. after a bit of back and fourth it was decided to cut my ADD meds and allowed me to stop the celexa, and only put me on Modafinil 100mg and carbamazepine 100. I asked what are we going to do to replace the Adderall cause without ADD meds I'm a mess. Seems like she wasn't concerned about finding me a replacement at all .

Thing is with My ADD/Bipolar combo and only small dose of modafinil, I started getting some crazy mania. My ADD meds played a big part in me being stable. I pointed this out and was told ""Well we have to take care of your mania first,then maybe we will try wellbutrin."" Even though missing the ADD medication was what was making me unstable. Fine, [w](https://whatever.As)hatever.  As long as I get it treated after that.

And now we get into the shit. Since we couldn't raise my carbamazepine because of my eyes(at 200 I started getting blurry vision after years of being on it, and have a family history of glaucoma so that was out) I had mentioned when I was younger that I was on Abilify for a while and that seemed to do me good then,but they changed it because I'm fat.  

Turns out your body can react much differently after 15 years. Started getting ""RLS"" during the day where sitting down was uncomfortable, got really irritable easily, my blood sugar started going up to 180 even when fasting, and started getting intestinal issues(going to the bathroom almost every half hour.) So I called her up so we could try something else. Simple,right?

Her response? ""Well you did well on it when you where 15, so you shouldn't have any problems now.(I'm 30 now.) You'll just have to deal with it, and since you've messed with your meds once before we're not changing it."" 

Okay, so you're holding something I did when I was FEARING I WOULD DIE IN MY SLEEP against me when I'm having a bad reaction were the pooping is so bad I'm afraid to leave my house?Where I can't even enjoy things I used to because of the ""RLS"" side effect? Where I'm scared to consume anything but Atkins drinks? Not even taking into account MY COMPLIANCE FOR MANY,MANY YEARS? Really? 

Told my case manager(helps manage other services from the mental health center) this, and I'm guessing she went to the P.Doc's higher up and he reviewed my case, had P.Doc switch me to Lamictal, since I did well on carbamazepine at higher doses and it works similarly . That turned out well and the one side effect I have on it is MUCH more tolerable, if a bit annoying.

So I go ask about the Wellbutrin like we discussed since the mania part was taken care of. She REALLY didn't want to put me on it, saying it wouldn't work(even though it was suggested before by her higher-up who is an actual psychiatrist?!), asking me if I worked or was in school(like she was trying to say I didn't need ADD medication if I'm not doing either of those things???Even though this is a quality of life thing???) And kept trying to say ""well it's not FDA approved for that"" over and over(Even though people are put on off-label meds all the time because other stuff doesn't work) and then after talking to another doc over the phone,FINALLY agreed to the script since I also had depression. 

ALSO: ""well you may not have ADD anyway since you had tachycardia from those medications"" ...That is the quackiest thing I've heard from a medical professional with my own ears. I /was/ mentally calmer on them, my heart decided it just didn't like it all of a sudden.

Turns out I'M NOT THE ONLY CLIENT HAVING PROBLEMS WITH HER. My case manger is actually encouraging me to switch to another one after all this BS.

120,"Hey mental health community,

posting today looking for some advice from those who suffer from anxiety and/or panic disorders. I have had anxiety, depression, and panic attacks since childhood due to neglect as a child and was untreated until I went to college. Now a senior in college, I have seen 3 therapists and finally found one I like and have had great results with that. Therapy alone is not enough to help my anxiety and panic attacks, although it does help, the panic attacks are back in full effect. Almost everyday I practice journaling, meditation, exercise, and other activities to help my mental help this is also not enough to relieve all my symptoms, especially the panic attacks. For awhile my general practitioner prescribed me Prozac and that did help take the edge off the intrusive, negative thoughts, and the depression, but had no effect on the panic attacks. After about a year and 6 months and a few dose increases, the Prozac seemed to no longer be working at all. He referred me to psychiatrist, who prescribed me Mirtazapine and Venlafaxine. I used both as prescribed for 6 months consistently, but hated the way Venlafaxine changed my personality into a mean, angry person. I decided to stop taking it and I have no regrets. Recently I injured my shoulder very badly and had to go to the ER, and part of the treatment I was given was 3 pills of 5mg of Valium to take home. My parents are both addicts so I have never, ever wanted to take opioids or anything that makes me ""whoozy"". I have only being taking them when necessary for pain and even then I split the 5mg pill in half because I am afraid of addiction. But I have to say... my anxiety has not felt more under control in years. I took only half that pill when the pain was unbearable and while simultaneously having a panic attack(as a result of the pain), and within 20 mins all my symptoms stopped. I don't want to grow up to be a drug addict like my parents, but I wonder if benzos could be the right medication for me to take when I am having a panic attack. The pill allowed me to go about my day, stop crying, go to work, have no intrusive thoughts. It made what would have been a horrible day into a day where I could enjoy my life. Should I talk to my psychiatrist about trying benzos for my panic attacks and anxiety? Or is the risk of addiction too much? I would love to know anyone's thoughts/experiences:)",16Feb2019,1

I am a third year Psychology and Counselling student at Teesside University. I am currently writing my dissertation which aims to assess why people with Mental Health problems use self-help blogs and forums. 

I will be using this Mental Health Subreddit to collect data for my dissertation, and I am wanting to recruit people who use this thread to be participants. Participation is completely optional. If you wish to take part, please email S6015890@tees.ac.uk to receive the information sheet and the consent form which will need to be completed and sent back electronically. 

To take part in this study, participants will be asked to write a piece around why they use mental health self-help forums or blogs. It will need to include why they are used, how/if they are helpful/unhelpful, whether it is used for support (either for yourself or others), is it for sharing experiences etc. Any other information you feel relevant is also welcome and encouraged. This response can either be emailed to S6015890@tees.ac.uk or replied to in this thread, whichever you prefer. 

All data collected will remain fully confidential, no personal details such as your name/age will be used; pseudonyms will be used to ensure confidentiality. Participants must be over 18 to take part, and must not be currently experiencing any mental health issues (you must be in recovery/recovered). 

This data will be used for the purpose of this dissertation only, and will not be published in any journals. There are no sponsors in relation to this research. 

Thank you for reading and I hope to hear from you soon.

Since then I feel this horrible dread like I'm going to die and I feel so confused. I just feel like I'm forgetting who I am or something. I feel so horrible. Is this some kind of anxiety attack or something like this? I'm just so scared and confused. ",16Feb2019,6

125,"For the last 6 months or so, I’ve been having a very hard time knowing if my memories are real or if they were dreams. I feel like the line between my dreams and reality is starting to blur. Some of the events that I thought were real but weren’t are huge, while others are boring and seemingly unimportant. I find I’m constantly asking my sister and husband if things actually happened or not because I genuinely can’t tell anymore.

126,"Hey everyone, I am fairly new here. I am a 24 year old man with depression from Turkey and I couldn't think any place else to ask for help. I have lots to unpack and I don't even know if it is right for me to ask for help here or from anyone. I started my master studies last october in Germany and since have been living seperately from my boyfriend of six years. I knew I was going worse all over again, I mean I started to realize something was not right during last weeks or months, but I thought it should'nt be the case since I was doing fairly fine for almost years for now and managed to get a place at my dream master studies. And last sunday I had an argument with my boyfriend regarding our ""open relationship"", which we were trying for some time with my request, and I wanted to discuss it again since I started to feel somethings were off with that subject and we realized we radically changed our opinions on the subject, him becoming more open or free, me thinking about ""closing"" it completely. Even though we still love each other and there is no apparent problem with us, this incident made things even worse and I'm spiralling down all over again for the last week. I even thought about harming myself and then just ending my life for good but just after some cutting myself, I tried to reach out to him because I needed support and I said that at least I wanted to hear him to say ""stay alive for me"" which he did, he tried to calm me down, and I managed to get out of that situation. And today I did nothing, just tried to spent some time, knowing as the time passes it again was getting worse. And here I am again, even though I can dismiss the idea of suicide I still want to harm myself and just feeling like shit, thinking about how I have so little people with me in this life. And this time worse, he couldn't help, because he is out at some bar with people from an event and he is not available, but I really need to hear his voice or find some anchor in this world. I hate being a burden for him or for anyone but here I am being a useless piece of shit again and just blaming him. I cannot stop these intrusive thoughts about how he is becoming distant from me, how I am a not-worthy of love of a person, etc. And I don't know if I am a good person or not but I don't I just need someone to listen to me and keep saying to me that I need to stay alive.

127,"I’ve not done this before so please bare with me if this is awkwardly worded or longer than it needs to be.
I’m 23 yrs old. I’ve had depression and anxiety from a pretty young age and I have learnt to cope with that, for the most part.
However, due to two abusive relationships and an assault, I have been left with ptsd.
I was doing so well with my recovery, I finally felt in control again. Until November. I was feeling bad again and I ended up being sent to hospital at for a psychiatric assessment. While there, my fiancé and I broke up. She told me my issues were ‘foreign’ to her.  Less than a week later, she was with someone new. Since then I’ve been really up and down, which brings me to now.
I don’t know who to turn to; my friends have their own problems, my parents feel guilty about what happened to me and I don’t want to make anyone else feel upset. But, everything feels so pointless. The only people who would miss me are my parents. My friends would be okay eventually, they could move on. I just don’t know how to drag myself out of how I’m feeling right now. I feel so out of control of everything. I feel so alone. I have no idea what I’m hoping to achieve from this honestly. 
Does anyone have any advice on how to drag myself out of this? ",16Feb2019,2

129,"I wake up crying every morning. I’ve gone through 4 jobs in the last 3 months. I quit another one this morning. I have a wonderful fiancé who I love dearly. I know that quitting is selfish of me, but I just can’t get myself to keep going to my new jobs. I get fixate over one problem and I lose sleep over it. If I lose my fiancé I will no longer be able live in this world. 

I’ve been taking Zoloft since I quit a job that I was at for about a year and a half. 3 months have gone by and I’ve quit 4 jobs. I try to stay positive, but it’s just so hard. I think about what I have to lose. 

Have any of you experienced similar battles? I just can’t bring myself to do the stuff I know I need to do in order to succeed. I don’t really have any friends I can talk to. My family just says “well, ya gotta figure it out..” &amp; I get that. That’s what life is all about. I have got to overcome my struggles, but it seems damn near impossible and it’s getting worse as I get older. When I was 18-19 I worked retail at a pool store, didn’t think anything of it. Now I stay away from retail because I almost got into a physical confrontation with a rude customer. 

I feel like I’m in a hole that I’ll never beable to get out of. I don’t want to keep doing this stuff to my fiancé and myself.  ",16Feb2019,1

I know about all the protocols that need to be in place for my safety and her safety when I tell her we're divorcing and serve her. The one I'm having trouble with is notifying her psychiatrist. I have no idea who she's seeing. She's made sure of that. She might not be seeing anyone at all, although she tells me she does. She has no prescriptions. She doesn't write checks for it. She doesn't run it through insurance. With HIPAA I can't just go around asking if she's someone's patient. Any ideas? Or alternatives to having her counselor stand by to make sure she doesn't hurt herself? I don't hate her. It would devastate me if she hurt herself. I just can't be married to her anymore.

132,"Hello,

I am a public speaker on mental health (with lived experience). I am now in ""recovery"" and have been for almost 9 years now. But I still struggle emotionally from time to time, but nothing comparable to what I was experiencing before I got diagnosed 9 years ago. I get a lot of requests to do talks, I don't even know why because I often feel that what I say is not helpful to the people in front of me. I always speak from my personal experience, explain what are my coping tools and strategies but I always feel like it's irrelevant for the people in front of me who often, are still struggling. Does it insult you when a speaker on mental health talks about their coping strategies (listening to music, talking to friends, taking walks, writing, etc.) and their experience with mental illness?

133,"Hey all! First post here! I'm a high school teacher with a short history in the mental health area, and occasionally have students who want to speak with me about depression, anxiety, disappointments, guilt, shame, suicidal ideation, eating disorders, body image issues, abuse, etc. I am not licensed and without fail will always report the issues to the proper authorities when necessary and counsel my students to seek professional help when possible. Nevertheless, one thing the students rarely get is someone to listen and encourage them in their struggles. Seeing the student as a person and not just a client is something they tell me they value and something I'm very good at.

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who always wants to be as helpful as possible, I'm looking for areas to grow in my knowledge and skill in being a lay-helper. I encourage my students to acknowledge their feelings and rather than avoid them or disregard them, experience them in a healthy and accepting way. Despite these areas, I'm looking for resources that help me give more practical counsel and advice to the students on *how* to do that. Do any of you have any resources, tips, books, articles, (preferably books) that talk about emotional health? Just pointing me in the right direction would be immensely helpful! Thanks!",16Feb2019,2

136," 

The last couple of days have been very bad. I mean yeah they could've been worse if I had let myself do what I wanted, which is rip myself to shreds and slit my throat. Which I planned to do once I got home from work today. Of course I wasn't planning to kill myself really. I am pretty sure I do not have the proper strength to do that.

But I have fallen into a darker cloud. The episodes I get before bed keep me up until I cry enough that my eyes swell and I can barely open them. The night before last was not as bad and I fear this night will be worse than last. Last night I even had an anxiety attack, possibly a panic. I did not feel fear just the hyperventilating with a side of not being able to breathe because it felt like I had something stuck in my throat, and an overwhelming feeling of how much I hate myself.

It is getting so bad. I am starting to fear if this streak keeps going. The last two nights my mind would only repeat, "" I want to die."" Over and over without stopping, back to back. It is destroying me.

I will destroy me if I cannot find a grip in this black cloud.

I would probably say it really started on Valentines day, when the bf brought up the one thing we argue about. Sex. You can search my older posts for details if you do not know.

but now every time he brings it up I feel like killing myself. I feel like all I ever do is destroy everything. I know it is not my fault for the way my body responds and how I feel but it makes me hate myself more.

I have cut the last three days. Not nearly as much as I want to. I fear my day off alone tomorrow. Since none of my friends seem to have time to even say hi anymore.

I have given up on that as well.

I am not reaching out to them anymore.

I also exploded on my store manager on Valentines. It was busy as fuck and I just exploded and yelled at the top of my lungs in front of customers and everything.

He did not talk to me for half the day.

138,"Over this past summer, I experienced a severe anxiety episode that has mentally scarred me. I was submitted to a crisis center, and when I came back in felt better. It only lasted a month or two. I started to get easily shaken by things that reminded me of the occurrence (shows, songs, etc.) And actively tried to avoid them. I took medicine that did help with it for a few months until they started giving me violent thoughts (hurting others, etc.), so I stopped taking them. I didn't mention said thoughts to parents until months later, and I regret not saying anything sooner as I'm still having them. Anyways, my anxiety attacks happen on and off, and lately they've been getting closer together. They've been five weeks apart, but now they're starting to happen within two or three weeks of each other. Yesterday, I have become severely paranoid at the thought of dying even though I am only a teen and do not have to worry about that for a very long time. I'm so scared, and I don't know what to do. I saw a therapist, but we moved away from her, so I couldn't go to appointments anymore. My mom says she's still looking, but I think she's just telling me that to reassure me. At this point, I'm so scared of death and cannot stop thinking about it, but at the same time I feel like it would be easier if I just died. I don't plan on doing anything rash, I just really want help because I feel like my world is falling apart. My mind is literally collapsing and I'm only 16. I haven't said much about this to my parents because I'm afraid I'm stressing them out, but I feel as if I really should've said something sooner. I regret it so much. I just want to go back to being the happy and goofy person I was. I hate making everyone around me feel stressed because I can't get myself together. I feel like such a burden. If this sounds like ptsd to you, please tell me what I can do please, I'm begging. Thank you.",16Feb2019,4
