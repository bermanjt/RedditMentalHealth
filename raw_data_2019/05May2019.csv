0,"In the past few months I’ve been occasionally hearing things, and when I look back on it I realize that it probably wasn’t real.

The biggest one that I remember is when I was walking back to class from the bathroom and I swore I heard someone whispering my name twice from behind. I turn around and not a single person was around. 

The smaller ones I was able to just write off as my mind playing tricks on me or being tired. But a little while ago it was another big one. I was in the bathroom brushing my teeth when I heard footsteps come up to the door and try to open it, but it was locked. I said that I’ll be right out, and no more than 10 seconds later I came out and no one was around. I went downstairs to ask my parents, the only other people home, if they had just tried to get in and they both said no. 

How do I know if there’s an actual problem or if I’m just an idiot?",05May2019,1

3,"I'm not sure if this belongs here, and I know its way more minor than a lot of posts on this sub, but I don't know where else to discuss it.  


My family has always had a lot of dogs, like 4+ at all times in my life, and I've always been an animal person. About five years ago we got this stray Pitbull, and he is super sweet, we've never had the stereotypical Pitbull problems and he's been a great dog. He's about 7ish now ( we never knew his exact age) and me and him have always gotten along better than the rest of my family. He sleeps with me every night, he follows me everywhere, and he always jumps up on my lap no matter how small of a chair I'm sitting in. I don't have a very active social life, but I'm not depressed at all. I'm very happy with my social life and how much time I spend at home. Because I sped a large amount of my time at home I am with my dog a lot.   


Here's where I get to the point, I talk A LOT with my dog, like, we'll have full conversations. I am fully aware that he can't understand me and I don't hear voices talking back or anything, but I still talk to him a lot. It's not even in like a baby voice either, it's just normal talk. I have a normal amount of friends and even a couple of people I would call true friends, but I still see my dog as my best friend, as the only person who really knows me. I've also always been someone who talks to themselves a lot. I'll explain situations the motives to my actions to myself. Again, I don't hear anyone talk back, but I still feel the need to explain myself to myself.  


I know this is probably no big deal and a really minor thing for this sub, but I'm not sure if it's normal.",05May2019,5

Ever have days where it's hard to know how to communicate because there is so much going on in your head? It's a beautiful day here and I missed the whole thing by laying in bed quietly mulling over my stresses. I know what I would tell me.. get up and live life. Thing is, I do that every day. Fake smiles and fakeness from one event to the next. Today, I just caved and my mind and body lost the energy to fake more. I had to stop and feel. I hate it. I hope tomorrow is better.

6,"I don’t even know how to describe this. There’s something not right with me. All I do is get into relationships that end up being unstable and chaotic, with my constant fears of them leaving or cheating causing me to ruin everything. I don’t get over breakups. Instead I feel totally empty and suicidal until it leads me to get back together with the person to alleviate emptiness. 

When my boyfriend leaves me at night to go home to his own house I feel so abandoned and often panic. He broke up with me before and I still have horrible panic about that breakup as it was the worst time of my life. Can’t stop replaying it. The chronic emptiness was the worst thing I ever experienced. 

I can’t seem to drink normally. I have a drink and then keep drinking until I’m too drunk and might get aggressive. I have no friends. I’m too afraid of rejection for a job. I went to a college therapist and he only talked about anxiety but I think there’s something else wrong with me, I just don’t know what it is. I just don’t feel normal :(",05May2019,1

8,"Hi so I’m posting this in several subreddits to get more opinions but here goes.

So this friend was 6 years old when they took a rock to a cat’s head and killed it. For simplicity’s sake let’s call this person Meatball. Meatball cried when they told me this and I felt terrible for them and for the cat. The things Meatball’s parent did to them when they fessed up to what they did was terrible. Bruises, busted lip, and NO talk about consequences of actions or that animals die. Just violence. This has troubled my friend for years.

Many would think Meatball is a sociopath/psychopath for what they did but I strongly believe this friend is not dangerous. I believe from what I’ve been told other times about their family that Meatball is a victim of physical as well as emotional child abuse from early on and simply did not know what they were doing. Meatball however is incredibly traumatized by this even to the point where they sometimes feel disgusted with themselves when they hang out with my cat.

When Meatball first told me this I was a bit frightened for my cat but when I sat down and thought about it: a human being that’s been on the planet for only 6 years cannot understand what death is on their own. Meatball always says how horrible they feel for what they did and always feels the need to reassure me they would never harm any animal ever again and especially not my cat. Meatball has never been aggressive to me or my animals; however, they do have some slight anger management issues to which they walk away from the irritation and go for a walk or smoke CBD in the patio to relax.

I am encouraging Meatball to seek help as this event and the abusive aftermath has taken a toll on them. They think of the cat they killed every day, and feel constantly like their cosmic retribution is near for what they did. Meatball is my roommate and best friend and I am concerned for their mental health. They are a good person and I don’t want them to be tormented by something they did as an unsupervised child.

Basically what I’m asking is if anyone can give their opinion on the situation and advice on how I can help Meatball move forward from this tragic event. I’d really appreciate it.

TL;DR: My friend Meatball killed a cat at 6 years old and is still troubled by it, believing they’re a terrible person that doesn’t deserve good things. How do I help them see they were only a child and move forward?",05May2019,1
9,"I was on 5mg of lexapro for a few months for anxiety and panic attacks and felt amazing. Then doc said to up to 10mg and figured it would be ok. I was wrong. Within 2 day’s it made me have no emotions or sex drive. Lowered the dose back to 5mg after a couple days. Was on that for a few weeks and got really disoriented and still felt like a sociopath. Doc said to stop taking it and switched me to buspar 5mg once a day, got extremely depressed. I’m guessing from the lexapro withdrawals? Now it’s been three weeks since I switched to the buspar and I still feel like a disoriented sociopath with no sex drive. I had a 3.8 gpa in college now this semester I went from a’s in everything to failing everything and I planned to go to med school.

THIS IS RUINING MY LIFE. I am usually a very empathetic and motivated person. I feel like a completely different person.

11,"So, in the past I had really bad (diagnosed) social anxiety. It was to the point where I'd even be afraid to go downstairs because someone might see me through the window (like really afraid). If I was outside and heard or saw a car coming I would litterally run behind something so they couldn't see me. It went away a few months ago almost completely, no clue why but whatever. Now, the problem I'm having (and honestly I think it's worse than how my anxiety used to be) is overthinking. For example, I'll be laying in bed and think ""i'm laying kind of wierd, how would (some person) be laying right now?"" Then I'll think, ""why am i overthinking this? i should remember this because my therapist doesn't really understand what i'm trying to tell him."" Then I'll think something along the lines of ""just ignore it it doesn't matter"" then go back to thinking ""well it might be significant so I should remember this."" example would be how if I need to tell my mom something I'll repeat it, sometimes even whispering it, over and over to see if it sounds right. I overthink everything but I don't feel anxious, I don't have a worry in my head that leads to overthinking anymore. The amount I overthink does almost ruin my life. I can't really think to do schoolwork, even at home. I can't enjoy things I used to. I can't play video games anymore because I can't focus. I've stopped working out. I've stopped having fun when I go out with friends. Thing is, I don't feel anxious, yet I overthink everything. Is this anxiety?",05May2019,1

I never even have conversations with these people, I’m just attracted to their looks and what I imagine them being like and then can’t stop thinking about them.

16,"I’m 20. My entire life, I’ve considered myself very resolute. I survived my parents’ divorce. Being homeless with my mom ages 7-10. I’ve survived my family’s intolerance. I’ve survived racism. I’ve survived violence. I’ve survived crime. All with tongue in cheek. I’ve excelled at school. Usually top 10 statewide for academics, arts, and athletics. I’ve worked hard my whole life. Graduated high school Summa Cum Laude. Four different high schools in two different states across my academic career. I was able to get admitted into Brown and Kings College London. I’m currently attending UCF in Florida. I’ve always been described as “sPeCiAl”. As being a “nAtUrAl bOrN LeAdEr”. I’ve always been there for others. Guided them through storms. Through depression. Through suicide attempts. I’ve been there for everyone in my family. For all of my girlfriends with crippling mental issues. All my friends who thought less of themselves and I strove to open their eyes to their inexpendability. Their uniqueness. Their strength and beauty. I’ve always considered that I had the strongest mental health and so on and so forth of anyone I knew. The strongest faith. I let nothing hold me back. And yet, i don’t know why people think those things of me. I don’t know why i thought those things about myself. When I really think about it, I’ve always been filled with this vast, vast emptiness. I fight daily for it to not become darkness. These days it becomes more difficult. I wake up. I feel sadness. I hop out of the shower and get ready and i begin crying for no reason. I feel that everyone hates me and that i let everyone down. That i don’t do enough for myself or my friends or my family. In reality, i hate myself. Some days I wish I was never born. I observe life through eyes that are not my own. I exist in a consistent state of facetiousness and masks that hide that i am hollow. I do not exist within myself. Whoever was there, is no longer. Maybe never was. I don’t know where the strong shift began. I admit, I’ve experimented only a handful of times with things like LSD and marijuana. A cigarette every now and then. A drink or two whenever my family drinks. But I’ve always been a practitioner of a healthy diet, exercise 6 days a week, practice yoga and ballet. It makes me feel broken. I do what i have to do. I work hard towards my goals. I want to make the world a better place full of love, life, and light. But what exists within me is a dark void. I don’t know why I’m the way that I am. Why my mood shifts. Why I feel like I don’t deserve to be alive. I pray. I used to feel that God listened. Even as a man of science, as I am a STEM major, I believed that God, whoever it was, whatever it was, however many of them there are, was listening. All I feel now is radio silence. Any thoughts?

18,"Kind of disclaimer: I know I should see a doctor for the most accurate diagnosis and help, but I don't think I'm ready for that step yet.  I don't know that I want all of this to become real.



I've been looking into some mental illnesses and other mental health issues lately cause I'm worried about some things I've been feeling.  For a while now (definitely more than a few months if not close to / over a year) I've been having my emotions and mood all over the place.  I'll have periods where I feel top of the world, I have more energy than normal, I don't need as much sleep, I'm very easily irritable and my mind is running a million miles an hour.  And then I'll have periods of feeling like complete scum of the earth; I'm tired no matter how much sleep I get, I'm groggy throughout the day, I feel indifferent towards whatever happens, I feel hopeless and anxious and depressed, and, as much as I hate to admit it, I think about suicide, _**a lot**_.



There will be times where I'll feel one way for a day or two and then switch to the other.  Sometimes I've been depressed for close to a month before feeling amazing for a few days and going back to depressed (but never longer periods of feeling good).  I'll also have times where it'll switch daily; one day is great, the next awful.  On a few occasions, I've been back and forth a couple times in one day.



I've been looking into bipolar disorders, major depression, anxiety, etc. and I just don't know what to look for to give me the best idea of what's wrong with me.  I thought for a little bit it might be something like rapid cycling bipolar disorder but some sources (idk how reliable though) said episodes would last longer than what I've been experiencing.  I only slightly looked into cyclothymia and figured it was like bipolar disorder but less severe, but part of me disregarded it cause I've definitely been feeling the extremes of bipolar symptoms (mainly the suicidal part...).



Like I said, I know going to a doctor/therapist would be the best, but I don't know if I'm ready for what I'm feeling to become real.  I've been having suicidal thoughts for close to a year now, and it's been a lot worse in the last two/three months.  I'm just terrified of taking the next step and getting professional help (I know it seems weird that getting help scares me - idk how to explain it but it just does).



Does anyone want to / can anyone help put their two cents in to help me kind of narrow down what the hell is going on in my mind?",05May2019,4

20,"In all seriousness. Please reconsider before you comment a sarcastic “what a terrible problem to have”. Hear me out. I apologize for the length of this post in advance. 

My relationship with food and eating has always been weird. I was a small baby, albeit nothing abnormal. 6 lbs. Growing up I was always very small and didn’t like eating much, my grandma would always pull me inside during my summer play dates with cousins to give me a ham sandwich and ask if I’m eating enough at home. The answer was always yes, I had wonderful parents who didn’t cook elaborately due to money and full time jobs we had well rounded meals. 

Fast forward to prepubescent years, I was a stick and girls in middle school would always tell me I could be prettier if I just gained some weight. I tried! I wished more than anything to be curvy or at least not look sickly skinny. In the meantime I went to yearly doctor checkups, etc. and nothing was ever noted as out of the ordinary. 

I maybe barely grew an A cup of boobs by the time high school ended. I suppose being active and doing after school running clubs helped out on *some* weight and muscles. 

In college I took up rock climbing which definitely helped me put on weight and muscle for the first time ever. I have never experienced something that resembles an eating disorder (to me), I never starved myself or binged and in my household we had routine eating times. Living on my own has been harder and this is where my problems really seem to showcase themselves. I have issues with anxiety and have seen a therapist for over a year about it and general life struggles. I have communicated what I’m typing in this post to her before but it was somewhat brushed off (not to diss my amazing therapist, maybe I’m just making a big deal out of it?) but there have been times I’m too anxious to eat more than a snack here or there for a few days. Eventually I come around and eat normally. 

I’m still really thin appearing although I don’t think I’m “underweight”, I don’t know my BMI because I think that’s kind of inaccurate and BS. I’m 5’6” 108 lbs. I’m vegetarian for environmental/moral reasons, but when I ate meat I got down with steaks and the like. I broke 100 lbs in high school and since have only kept on 8 or so pounds. I just hate eating. If I could eliminate as one of life’s necessities I would. I hate cooking and nothing appeals to me. Some days every food and the thought of it makes me nauseas. Other days I just don’t have the desire. There’s nothing that I think about and say “oh, I REALLY want to eat that!” Sometimes I put eating off like it’s a chore until I feel like I could vomit just from feeling so empty. Then I’m too nauseas to eat. And I can identify the cycle but have a hard time breaking it because there is just no desire to eat. What is wrong with me? I know to an extent this must be related to my anxiety I guess? 

Some more info: I work on my feet all day (teacher) and my lunch break is maybe 15-20 mins on a good day. Usually it takes me a while to relax before I can eat so lunch breaks at school usually don’t result in much eating for me. So by the time I get home I’m passed my window for hungry and I’m just absolutely irritable, furious at the world, and hungry, but can’t get myself to eat. My partner has tried being supportive but has a hard time understanding (as do I) and quite fairly is tired of putting up with my hangriness.",05May2019,2

I seriously feel ill right now. When I stand up I get really dizzy and my stomach feels like it's doing somersaults. I also feel like I can literally feel the blood coursing through my veins and it's not a good feeling.

I've been diagnosed with schizoeffective disorder with bipolar tendencies, OCD, PTSD, and generalized anxiety disorder.

When I went through this last week I had my first visual hallucinations. I was diagnosed with psychoeffective disorder because I've had auditory hallucinations before. The visual hallucinations, frankly, scare the shit out of me. 

I had an appt with my p-doc a couple days ago and totally forgot to tell them that I'd had visual hallucinations. I'm dealing with some shit in my life and my living situation isn't the best, but I have to deal with it because it's either that or be homeless. I had focused so much on complaining about my living situation that I'd completely spaced on telling them about my visual hallucinations.

The people I live with feed and shelter me and my dog so, I don't feel like I can really complain about my living situation. But, I'm also caregiving and have been doing that for almost 11 years now and to say I'm struggling with caregiver fatigue is an understatement.

My p-doc is supposed to call me soon to setup an appt for a med check and therapy but, that's gonna be like a month away.

24,"My fiance (24f) went to the hospital close to two years ago with suicidal tendencies. She ended up getting sent to a pretty horrific place that was a prison step down program trying to convert into a mental health facility. As a result, there was no support or therapy, she was locked in with violent and abusive offenders and she ultimately ended up worse. We decided that rolling the dice by walking into the emergency room if she ever felt this again was a bad idea.

We are in really difficult financial times right now. She lost her job a couple months ago and with her mental health we haven't  found her another so I'm the only one bringing in money. Next week I have a bunch of time off because of a surgery she's having and I'll be getting paid less (I work on commission so when I take vacation and get paid hourly it's much less). I need to work tomorrow so we can pay our bills this month.

What do I do with her for the day? I'll be gone from 8am to 430-5 and she doesn't have any nearby friends she would be able to hang out with. I feel so stuck. I wish I could be there with her but calling out tomorrow means taking about a 150 dollar pay cut. Having her go out in a public place all day also seems unrealistic.

26,"So, I've been experiencing symtoms that are kind of like DID. I can't really explain it but I can give a recent example. Earlier today I was taking a shower. I was thinking about my mental health (which I do a lot) and how I feel like there's an entirely different ""me"" hidden behind almost like a glass wall. If I force myself I can kind of understand him, as in how he thinks. A few times I've been like him I'm not really sure why, once was after meditating and then going to sleep, once was after spending a few hours with a friend of mine. Anyways, it doesn't feel like a ""snap"" but somewhere during that shower I was on the floor moving my body in wierd ways, since I was thinking about DID (which I've done some research on in the past b/c of how I feel) I thought ""what do I feel like I am,"" talking about age and stuff. This is really wierd to type out now but I felt like a crazy middle age woman. That being said, the whole time I'm pretty sure I felt like I had oversight as to what I was thinking. I feel like I can dismiss that all as a placebo effect (The whole time I was thinking ""maybe i'm acting this way because it's how people with this act,"" except when I felt like a crazy middle age woman, but it still could be placebo). Anyways, the main problem for me is that I really feel like there's another ""me,"" a completely different person who's a version of me but also me? I can't describe it well. I can't describe the person but it doesn't feel like they occupy the same body as me. I kind of know them because I've been them but they don't really think about everything. To them life is just natural. They're a 16 year old boy with a name, which is what I actually am. When I think ""i'm a 16 year old boy named (name here)"" it doesn't feel right because I feel older. I feel like it could also be maybe dissasociation and what happened earlier today was just placebo. I do feel like that's happened in the past, I kind of remember being like that, very recently but I can't say exactly when.

I waited until college to get help because I would have more freedom, and I finally did. I went to counseling sessions, exercised often, ate healthy, and opened up to my very supportive friends. I saw a psychiatrist and she prescribed me with fluoxetine. I've been taking it for only 2 weeks so I don't feel any difference yet. But just a few days before that, I started my current depressive episode and things went down. I have no appetite, no energy to even get up from my bed, let alone exercising. I spend a lot of time on my bed while can't sleep. I started missing class because I couldn't get out of bed, and the thought of everything falling apart even discouraged me to go out even more. My mind is in no shape to study, while it is now final season and I have major tests and assignments due. And my mood is, of course, lower than sea level.

My coping strategies have been working temporarily so far: sleep even more, stress-starve, watch a lot of Youtube videos, text my younger sister (she is the only family member I trust enough to open up), paint my nails and maybe do some nail arts, and reading Tumblr for depression and eating disorder memes.

She has been in and out of the hospital non stop each time she comes home it is like she has a different illness. I am supposed to not notice her behaviours and just treat her like my sister I try and once I was able to. She has done unspeakable things I know it is her eating disorder and not her but I cannot forget them. Now she is worse than ever. She just got out of the hospital this weekend, she was kicked out. 

What happens is any chance she can she likes to binge and purge. She does this multiple times a day. For example tonight at the movie theater with my family she eats a large bag of popcorn then gets up to do what she does after then she does it again. Then she drinks diet pop. 

She looks extremely unwell and I get very scared everytime I see her doing these things I try to keep my mouth shut but then it all goes in and all I can think about is her constantly binging and then throwing it all down the toilet. 

I need to say something I say out of anger and stress ""you cant not purge for 3 hours?"" She says nothing my parents glare at me I feel great shame for what my words do to her and do to my parents. 

Sometimes I get very mad, so mad I lose all control and yell so loud profanity at my family I slam doors and punch holes in walls then after I feel so guilty. And I hold in all of my emotions. Untill I can't and it happens again. 

With my sister being back home I think I am acting different at school because all my friends arent my friends anymore. I don't know what to do or who to talk to.",05May2019,5
31,"Not even 30 min ago, my boyfriend and I tried this new app that uses meditation to help sleep. It was all the basic stuff. Breath in, breath out, and other grounding techniques. Normally stuff like that doesn't work because my mind won't let itself focus on the right things. However, this time my body actually responded, but my mind didn't relax. I felt my body getting heavier and what I can only describe as a tiny voice in the back of my head panicking because it didn't like the feeling. The dang thing just got worse till I was finally able to slowly move my body. I just couldn't stop moving my body for a few minuets after. It felt wrong to be still. Why did I get that reaction? I thought meditation is supposed to not do that. I don't think I had a panic attack, but my breathing was harsh, I was sobbing for a split second, and I just couldn't stay still. It almost felt like I had no control over my body for a few seconds. I also didn't feel like I was there either, like I was in a different room till the whatever it was went away. I'm sorry if this makes no sense. It's 1am and I am just trying to put everything out there before my brain pushes it off to the side",05May2019,6

33,"I don't understand how I can have such persistent, visceral, bodily reactions and feelings shame and embarrassment while simultaneously harbouring so many good, sometimes even grandiose, thoughts about myself.

To show you what I mean, let me try to paint you a portrait: I apologize all the time and feel guilty for everything, like asking to borrow a pencil, or accidently coughing too loudly, or even just speaking in class because it feels like a waste of everyone's time (even when I think I made a good point). I feel responsible for people's emotions and if they are sad I feel I should have done something differently to prevent it. I am constantly embarrassed by everything that escapes from my lips. My movements seem weird and wrong. I cannot look people in the eye for very long and I am told I hold my shoulders up to my ears. I also am the biggest people pleaser, never say no, and am extremely eager to impress and please those in authority. I am also a perfectionist and a master procrastinator and base a lot of my worth on my intellect. I also develop the most intense and irrational obsessions with unavailable people, like married men and teachers. Sexually, I have sought out sex with strangers as well as much older men, even though I do not like sex, just because I crave male validation so much. And I have put myself in very dangerous situations and done things I did not want to do, because I felt uncomfortable and guilty saying no. I had a not so great childhood, with verbal and sexual abuse, and that, plus most likely a genetic predisposition toward anxiety and mood disorders, contributed to who I am.

ALL THAT ASIDE, I actually have a weirdly high opinion of myself so it always confuses me when people say, learn to love yourself. Because I do love myself. Well I think I'm pretty cool, at least. I think I'm charming, sexually attractive, mature, empathetic and sometimes even brilliant. In a word, I think I'm ""special."" I know how deluded that sounds, and I'm sure it is to some extent, however it is also, I think, a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy. I really *am* special, though not always conspicuously so, and those that know me always comment on it. It's not that surprising, though, since I have spent so much time in my youth cultivating this ""specialness"" in myself. It's sounds so phony and un-appealing but the more I think about it the more I think it is a deeply human, and harmless, thing to do, in moderation at least. I am similarly confident in my ability to attract men, to

Now that I write this out I am realizing the areas where I do hate myself. I have a pretty rotten character. But most of what I hate is legitimate and needs to change. For instance, I lie a lot about small things because I'm afraid or ashamed or just feel like I can get away with it. I like to keep secrets and do bad things secretly and feel little remorse. I steal small things all the time and sneak and snoop when other people would not. I also feel no guilt about cheating academically, as long as I don't get caught, and that scares me. I almost never do it but that's just because I don't have the opportunity or desire to, not because I think it's important to be honest. I also dislike myself for caring so much about what others think and for cultivating a false self. I hate that I crave attention so much and that I will lie or exaggerate to get it. I hate that I'm so manipulative and that everyone thinks I am so nice and humble and kind when in reality I am way more narcissistic and self-absorbed than most. I hate that I get obsessed with fantasies instead of focusing on the people who DO love me. I also think I am pathetic for sleeping around and for starting to smoke cigarettes. I am incredibly ashamed, and try very hard to hide, my tendency toward self-pity. In truth, I think I am addicted to being the victim and receiving sympathy. I hate that I am obsessed with my childhood traumas and secretly want others to know about it. And although my shame about this desire to disclose usually stops me from ever disclosing, I still sometimes drop hints, and feel so stupid for doing it. Like a fucking 7th grader. I also really dislike my pervasive laziness and lack of self-discipline and my belief that I don't have that much control over my life.",05May2019,88
34,"Hi all. 

First time poster.  

Been dealing with anxiety for as long as I can remember. Have only been medicated for a few years - have gone to therapy when it was really bad. 

I’m on 30 mg of cymbalta/day. Lately, I feel like they have been making me fuzzy and not as clear and I have been managing my stress even better than prior to being on it. I decided about a week or so ago to go off of it, which I know wasn’t probably the best idea in hindsight. 

This week was very stressful at work between multiple short term deadlines along with my performance review. Some background - I haven’t exactly had it easy with my past few jobs. One job I was laid off after a restructure (loved this job and everything about it) another I was put on a PIP after being there for not even two months. Needless to say I was feeling very anxious and unsure of myself even after being pulled into multiple leadership meetings, being a point person on projects, etc. 


The last few nights I haven’t been sleeping as well.  The night before my performance review I barley slept, and the morning of I had a full panic attack/meltdown. Cried for hours - it was so bad, my husband (who, is very supportive, has a strong grasp on mental health and was raised by a social worker) kindly suggested that maybe it was a good idea to take a pill to take my edge off and calm me down before the meeting. He tried other ways of intervention prior to recommending this including holding me, listening to me, and letting me know he was there. I ended up taking a pill and felt a bit better afterwards - by this, I mean numb. 

I had my performance review with my manager, and it went fine - she rated me what I rated me. It was a relief. 

Today and yesterday, I have barley slept. My mind will not shut off. I can’t get to bed and when I eventually do, something in the middle of the night wakes me up, and I can’t pin point what it is. 

Has anyone had this happen to them? What did you do? How did you go about it?

Everyday for the past month since my girlfriend broke up with me I have been feeling like complete garbage and borderline isolating myself from everyone. Family and friends have told me I need to distract myself and spend time around friends but being around friends makes me feel worse even though I wasn't like that before while I was in a relationship, talking to people feels almost mentally draining and as emo as it sounds being around happy people makes me feel even more sad hearing them be able to laugh, smile and be in a good mood when I genuinely cannot even force myself to be in a good mood, It's like I almost feel better being alone. I also feel unloved even though there is friends and family that love me but it isn't the same love that you receive from a significant other that makes you feel special and genuinely cared for which also contributes to my sadness. I've always felt like this ever since I was younger, I only feel genuinely happy when I am in a relationship and when it ends it feels like my whole world is crashing down because I go back to feeling alone, unloved and cared for and it only seems to ever go away when I go to another relationship. I take heart breaks very hard and its to the point now where I don't even want to go into another relationship because I'm so scared of being hurt again and really don't think I can go through heart break all over again as a repeat cycle. There have been so many people I have dated who made me believe that they would never hurt me and end up doing it and I trust them not to everytime, but what is a relationship without trust? If you truly love someone you trust them but how are you supposed to keep trusting people when they keep hurting you over and over? I try distracting myself but it doesn't help, distracting myself doesn't change the fact I still feel alone when I don't have a significant other.

&amp;#x200B;

When I try to think, my brain grinds like an old, overworked computer with too many programs open to process. I think it has always been that way. 

I can think critically and logically as long as what I have to think about doesn't take up too much of my RAM at one time. If information fits on one page, I can learn it, but I easily get lost when it's more complex than that. Trying to focus my thoughts is like trying to look at floaters in my eyes. The harder I try to see them, the quicker they slip away.

In conversation, if there are two people present, I dissociate quickly so they can carry on a normal conversation. Otherwise, I make every effort to avoid social interaction, especially in real-time. I can't think fast enough to participate in a conversation. 

I haven't been able to hold a job for more than a few months in my adult life, and I have been unemployed for the past couple years. In most cases, I quit jobs because I can't deal with the boss asking how things are going all day every day. It's overwhelming. Meetings are torture. Because I can't be there, even if I am physically there. At this point, I'm not sure if I can think clearly enough to learn new job skills anyway.

Sometimes, just sitting, I can feel my brain go numb and tingly. One of my jobs involved medical imaging, and we needed to test the machine, so I volunteered to have my brain imaged. I didn't see anything that stood out as pathological in the scans. Some mild pituitary calcification, but the radiologist told me it was nothing unusual when I asked about it. Ugh, now I'm realizing that 

I'm currently self-employed, but not very productive at all. I spend all day most days making spreadsheets and checklists for projects, but everything is puzzle pieces I can't hold in my head long enough to put together. I try to treat the planning work as the edge pieces of the puzzle, but it doesn't seem to help. When I try to think, the thoughts just dissipate like dreams fading away as I try to grab them.

I'm still in highschool but I feel like I've already had enough of ""life"" as it is.

I think of it as purchasing something that's defective and then returning it back to a store clerk because it's no longer useful. 

In the past, I would try and off myself every day, and convince myself that I'm disgusting or ugly or a waste of space. I would take to heart all the things my parents told me and it destroyed me for hours. I never, ever slept and I was constantly throwing up and sick. But recently, since early January, I've been changing the way I think a lot. I think I'm clever, not necessarily 'smart', and somewhat attractive, but all of those other things that I thought about myself, I still think them; but I'm not upset about it, I've just accepted that they're true: if they were lies, then my family and friends wouldn't constantly remind me of them. 

I started doing self harm again, but it almost feels good to me. I like watching the blood leak from different cuts along my body and I marvel in the gross and painful feeling that follows. I overeat just to make myself puke afterwards because I love the feeling of it. I convince myself that I'm only worthy of being someone's whore that should be kept in a pig's sty, and I treat myself that way too.

When I am stressed they argue, when I'm having a panic attack they scream and swear at each other. Sometimes I just catch myself talking with a voice, one that's also inside me, a part of me - and sometimes they just won't stop talking to each other.
I tend to refer to them as 'Redacted-2' if I don't like what he's saying, or thinking and 'Redacted-1' if I do. But there's more to it than that, Redacted-1 is a fun guy and redacted-2 is a bit of a dick. They have creative differences. I know they're both me even though sometimes I tell them to shut up.

58,Sooo I’m not a smoker but lately I have been getting into meditation and the incense cones where part of something I would use to help increase my focus.  So. I bought two packs because they were cheap.  Call it the placebo effect but I found it eased me and helped me focus.  So I was working at home and decided to burn 3 of them on my work desk.  I’m pretty sure some of the smoke fumes got into me which is what lead me to look up the effects of it on the human body.  The answer is it can cause cancer easier than cigarettes.  This kinda worries me because I’m a generally healthy person.  Should I be worried because of two 1/2 hours of doing this?  I mean the smoke was right in my face.

60,"I've been working with my therapist for over a year. I've also seen a psychiatrist who periodically checks on how we're working together.

When I went in I was a mess inside and out. I experienced such bad anxiety that I would shake while there, could barely speak, had terrible agoraphobia, constant PTSD flashbacks, etc.

Though my time up there we brought the anxiety down to manageable levels, communication has become easier, and the flashbacks aren't as overwhelming. My agoraphobia is still bad and I still get a lot of PTSD symptoms, but I am more functional than I was when I went in.

Because of this outward improvement they think I am ""cured"" and think I just need to keep on with what we've done on my own. That they've gotten me back on track and now my life is ahead of me.

I have repeatedly told them I don't feel any better on the inside. That I still fight daily against suicidal thoughts, self-hatred, depersonalization, and anhedonia. Outwardly I am functioning better, but inwardly I have nothing left and am really struggling. Literally the only thing preventing suicide is that I know it would be a blow to them and I don't want to hurt them. I have no care about myself though.

I've told them all this but all they say is ""You see yourself as weak but you are stronger than you think"", or they tell me that I am courageous, or brave, or some other positive word to describe how *they* see me. They refuse to accept that what I am feeling is real, and refuse to understand just how difficult it is to get in bed and go to sleep rather than end things so I don't have to do another day as me.

I had my last session with them recently and they just said all that again, acting like this is just temporary feeling I'm having despite me having felt like this for more than 2/3 of my life. I went to them to find out how to stop feeling dead inside but I feel no more alive than when I went in.",05May2019,12

70,"With... *anything.* I'm still trying to figure out what seems like the best career fit for me. I'm only 20, so I know that's probably not the best use of my time... but school kind of drilled that idea so far into my head from pretty much day one that I can't really consider anything else. I cycle through a thousand different things I'm not prepared or qualified for every couple of days and I can't seem to commit to anything and work on getting myself to that point.

But I also don't know what I want out of life in general. I guess I just want peace? But, like... I can't think of a way to attain that. I don't want to have to worry about anything anymore, and the only way I can see that being the case is killing myself.

And I tried that. Hell, I remember the *date* and it was just about 8 months ago. Almost to the day, coincidentally.

It's done nothing but bring me grief, and more pain. Back in September I came within a step of jumping off an overpass. That overpass is walking distance from my house, in an area that I pass more or less daily. Every time I see it I regret that I didn't follow through.

I've told my immediate family about it, and they (rightfully) didn't take it great. They know vaguely about the issues I've been struggling with, but they don't know how low I get pretty regularly. My friends don't know about the suicide attempt. I need to tell them, but whenever I try the words just don't come out.

It's affecting my friendships in the worst way. I'm anxious and on edge when we hang out. I'm tired. I'm irritable. I'm not a very good friend these days, and they're well aware of it. I *know* it's irritating them that I'm not who I was, but I just can't get the words to come out and just tell them what's going on. I'm scared they'll leave me. They're all I have left these days and I don't want to be alone.

When I was a child I wanted to have some serious illness. I still fantasize about this and it’s awful.
I pretended to be transgender as well. I pretended to be lesbian as well. I was diagnosed with depression and I struggle believing it because I always pretend to have illnesses that I don’t have. I was actually happy to be diagnosed with depression. I’m on meds now. I wish I could drop them because I probably am not depressed, it’s just another made up thing of mine. But my mother thinks I’m depressed so she wants me to take them.
Whenever I have a problem I look up mental disorders that could explain it. Like, I can’t stand being emotionally close to people. I feel vulnerable and don’t want others to know that I’m a shit of a person. I try to diagnose myself some kind of mental disorder for this.

It's the first time she's ever been on a psych ward, and I wish she could have stayed in the one 30 miles away because the staff there are wonderful and the ward is one of the nicest. But her transfer was to an absolutely shitty ward with indifferent staff, in an area which has got massive issues with drug and alcohol abuse (and guess where they detox - or not, cos it's so easy to sneak drugs and booze in), and no permanent consultant psychiatrist, it's all locums.

And it breaks my heart because I have been to both wards as a patient myself and I know which one I would rather be at. She's fiercely independent and the ward she's now in has a habit of treating you like a child and speaking down to you. It's also a Bank Holiday weekend here in the UK so she won't see a doctor until Tuesday. Something I myself have experienced on the exact same ward, so I know what its like.

I know she has to stay for the time being, she's not well enough to be at home, they told her if she tries to leave they'll section her. But even though we're not particularly close, I miss her.

82,"I am over age 48 with my Masters.

Never mind the industry for now.

Psychology was a dual component and not my main line of work.

I worked in Corporate.

I was raised in upper mid class. And it was very dysfunctional.

https://youtu.be/5IS5HPlpe7Y

I left my abusive family and their money to try and survive on my own.

Due to the lifestyle habits I learned in that world, it kept me from developing friendships with people my age who were raised to marry early after h.s., sometimes forgo college, buy a home &amp; raise a family.

I didn't want children. A spouse later on maybe, but not children.

My habits of ambition, education, constantly learning, changing careers, traveling, lovers in between, shaped me for who I am today.

What I didn't know was the Corp cultures are Conservative family-centric places that want comformity. Like Catholic Schools &amp; the military.

Non-comformity doesn't mean rebellious. For me it was that I could think for myself &amp; not be a cog or a drone.

But Corp is where the money is.💰💰💰

I was a WB whistleblower too. A couple of times. Little did I realize as part of damage control when I did that, partnering employers hired me at a much lower pay rate when I moved away but kept me micromanaged, in non-leadership roles &amp; under surveillance.

It was the same schema as my family.

Money = control = mindgames = image management = focus on what others might say or think about you = secrets = lawyers to sweep things under the rugs = don't ask questions = stonewall

So when I share that one aspect about myself it draws anger, resentment &amp; indifference from others who walk away because they haven't lived it.

I've been terminated with hush money &amp; kept out of any &amp; all work.

Its too late to ""pick up &amp; move across country again."" From all the stress, protracted legal stuff I experienced from filing discrimination claims at employers that tried to hard to push the ""skunk"" out of the Co, my body has worn down at a certain age. I don't have the Millennial ""rock star"" ""Energizer bunny"" ""malleable"" demeanor.

And that's what employers want. 

I was like that. But the one mistake I didn't do that most of my generational peers did, was marry &amp; have children.

That was what was expected. We didnt have Diversity &amp; Inclusion or LGBTQ groups. I'm heterosexual. I'm a floater. I don't box myself in to a protected group.

Our world is so divided with much anger, discrimination and hate.

Divisons, splitting, are what powerful people do to maintain control. 

It's too late to start a business. I know what's involved. 

Some people live life on a whim, no budgets, no worries about how am I going to live 1,5,10 yrs from now.

It's hit me like a ton of bricks. I'm screwed. Family is gone, parents died yrs ago, I was estranged like I didn't exist.

I'm treated that way now.

I tried getting counseling to cope but the T and MSW were not understanding of my background or thinking. They couldn't relate. 

They try to keep people alive for ""one more day"" ..food pantries...Govt Assistance programs....i dont qualify for Govt tax payer programs.

But people bring it up because I'm middle age &amp; cant get hired. And they get angered when I bring up the facts from researching so we can't have a conversation.

Lots of people cherry pick advice without checking it out first. 

I'm isolated, can't get work, money running out. Employers don't hire people like me in the low wage quick cash jobs because I'm not the bartender, server type who can juggle beer mugs &amp; trays while smiling with conviviality. 

Former felons, SSI/SSDI, recovering addicts &amp; Veterans have programs to help integrate them back to tax credit hire Govt subsidized work.

There is nothing for WB whistlblowers.

If I was in my 20'-30's I'd get hired.
At my age, people are retiring or forced to retire in 5-10yrs.

But they had the nest egg from the marriage or divorce, no grad sch loan and some savings from their long tenured ""same career from 30 yrs"" job.

Programs, non-profits, Govt assistance are to keep one fed but not housed and living with freedom and discretionary income.

I like to work, and I need to work, in meaningful, [non-boring - routine, low wage, dead end, no healthcare, dental, vision, no retirement savings] work that pays me a living wage and that matches my skills.

I've planned my ""S"" because I'm without social supports &amp; blocked from getting ANY job. No temp agencies, or any of the diverse career fields I explored.

I've tried all different States. Nothing. Older people need connections, not online Indeed type portals.

Im rarely happy for people, but I want to be and in the occasion that I can share in other people's accomplishments it feels great.

It's likely because I really struggle with my own life. Everything feels like a competition. I am uncomfortable making decisions, about anything, so if other people are held back and can't progress without me then I don't feel alone or useless.

Sometimes, when I'm successful, I am overly proud of myself. I want people to acknowledge my achievements when I struggle to do the same for them.

It's kind of childish. I know. I just don't know how to stop it.

I think it's also got something to do with not wanting to be vulnerable or cooperative. Everyone is a threat and their achievements are my failures.

anyway my main concerns are these;
1. I have had phases throughout my life where I stay I  bed for months to a year at a time and then go through life 2 months very high mood, reckless and very impulsive with drinking and drugs. 
2. I've always had psychosis but lately its so much worse, so much so that I have had a constant headache for the past week. (also, i had a sudden onset during sex (sexual headache) which triggered the splitting headache to begin with tbh) but its constant and nothing is making it go away. it's making my neck hurt and shoulders and I feel physically sick all the time.
3. I literally cannot sleep at night, ever since I was a child I always slept in the day or not at all and my insomnia/thoughts are so bad that the only thing that can knock me out is weed and A LOT of sex.

87,"Hello everyone,

1) Is the onset of schizophrenia very gradual or is it very sudden? Like one day you will wake up and hear voices?

2) Can you give yourself Schizophrenia or can you trigger the onset? I am worried that from all of the stress that I have been going through about this obsession and the job search, all the Vitamin D I have been consuming (1 pill a day), all of the masturbating I do (like 1-3 times a day) will trigger the onset of schizophrenia and that I may have triggered the onset of the disease. There is no family history of the illness that I am aware of.

3) My clinical psychologist said I do not have schizophrenia nor am I in the prodomal phase, however, due to the voice like intrusive thoughts that I have (which sound like my inner voice but in different pitches), I cannot let it go. I am not experiencing any auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations or delusions or any of the negative symptoms. Yesterday, I went out to dinner with my childhood friends and showed no signs of paranoia or psychosis

4) I am worried like, what if the intrusive thoughts, and when I imagine what schizophrenic voices sound like will turn into voices and what if they give themselves names? I have done a lot of reading where I 

5) Can you have a career with Schizophrenia? I am worried if I develop Schizophrenia the business degree I have worked hard towards obtaining will go to waste and I wont be able to have a career.",05May2019,4

I thought I was stupid. I had an aide in grade 5 and 6. I could not keep my desk clean and my papers organized. I was also behind in math. 

In grade 7 and 8 I was even more embarrassed. It took me longer to do projects and I didn't want extra help. I wanted to just not go back to school. Grade 9, 10, and 11 have been good though.

95,"I used to have this problem (kinda still do) where I would only date people I don't know. I didn't know what I was doing at this point until I just recently realized I was doing it. 

I would basically only date people who I didn't know because it would take me out of my miserable world and lift me into another, a new ""love"" filled world, with this new person. I was mostly turned off by people I knew already

But as soon as that newness wore off, I would feel like shit back in my old world, except, now there was another person in it. I thought ""what the hell are you doing here? I don't want anyone here"" and as soon as I couldn't take it anymore, I would break up with them or make them breakup with me (somehow), because I hate breaking hearts. I didn't want other people to be in my world because I felt like I had to basically ""clean it"" for them to not hate me and because I wanted to be alone (didn't know that at the time) and I didn't and couldn't clean it, it's mental illness, it's not as easy as just ""clean it up then!"". It's like when you have someone over and your house and/or room is a mess. You clean it to make it presentable for the other person. 

I didn't know what this feeling was, it was really strange, I just went dull, and panicky and sick. I  felt that love just drain out of me, for many other reasons too, sometimes I would think ""why did I rush into this? I don't want this"". 

NOW, while new people still exite me and I imagine our whole imaginary life together in a flash lol, but really all I want is to share my miserable world with someone, it's changed. I want someone to be miserable with. And I want it to be OUR problem, and the same goes for they're problems. I want to let someone in. I've always loved helping people, I like to browse reddit (used to be yahoo answers but fuck that place I hate it) and find people who have problems I'm familiar with and let them know they aren't alone or share my coping techniques. So the thought of someone putting their problems on my shoulders is actually kind of comforting to me. 

I want a genuine partnership, I'd even skip the honeymoon phase if it means that I can have something genuine. 

I don't know what mental problem that is, I have a bunch, but it's hard to identify it.

d I am Muslim I came to this. I came to this Reddit community in order to ask you guys to find out what is wrong with me lately, I've been going through a lot trying to figure out if I'm depressed, or if I'm bipolar or if I have adhd of course, since I'm Muslim, my mother won't try and find a treatment for me, all she'll say is that God will heal you Anyways, I'm going to now list the symptoms of what I've been going through

Number one. Lately I've just felt very I just I just feel like shit. Like, I don't know how to put it, I just feel worthless even in soccer where I used to be the best player in my old team. Now. Now I can barely catch the ball and pass and shoot, I think it's, nothing, I just been having really low self esteem like I honestly don't know why it's I just, I just feel worthless, I also feel empty inside but yeah that's symptom 1 feeling worthless and empty

Also a quick p s, I am not typing this, I thought it would be more genuine if I were to speak into my phone and my phone would type so please understand if I am pausing in the middle of my speech, thank you.

The second symptom, I've been feeling is immense anger, I just don't know it's been happening these past 2 weeks, where I'm just really, really angry, like, let me give you an example. It was, I think, a week ago my friends and I were watching Netflix during lunch time at school on the class computer it's a break had finished and the teacher walks in and calls my name and tells me to go home since my parents are here to get me. So I start packing my stuff, and I forget that I need to log out of my Netflix account, but then my teacher comes and stops me. By the way, it's not the same teacher that called me and said that my parents are here to pick me up. The teacher stopped me and said to go back to my seat, I told her ok, one second, let me just log out of my account, she proceeds to tell me to go back to my seat, and I'm like, ok, I understand just one second and then she just starts grabbing me, pushes me back to my seat. Telling me Bros chill out, calm down. My see, I went to go, turn it off and she grabbed me and I just pushed her, and I punched her desk as hard as I can. I knocked down her books, knocked down everything, and then I just left the school, and there's been many scenarios of me getting angry all sudden, once I'm this asshole of a kid punched me in that I punched him back and is like, oh that punch doesn't even hurt so then he said, let me punch you again, I told him no many times, regardless of my warnings he when he still punched me. Me, I was furious, I grabbed the table, I threw it on the floor and I punched him in the face, and there's honestly many more incidents of that happening just these past 2 weeks, but I've already talked a lot about this one symptom.

My next symptom is being very, I guess I lose interest very fast, I don't concentrate, I lose concentration, I can't focus, I don't know how to tell you exactly how I feel, but pretty much I'll give you an example, like I gave to all the others, this also could fall under the losing motivation symptoms, but I don't even know if I'm gonna make that a whole symptom itself, maybe anyways alright, now, I have a chemistry final to study for, and I know that I need to study, and I know it's important, but I just can't, I just don't have motivation anymore, honest to God. I don't think I can study, but I need to, but I can't, and I don't know why. I just don't know also I always start new hobbies, lose interest in hobbies, it just happens you know.

My last symptom is my mood changes one time. I'm happy, like maybe like 20 seconds after I'm really, really mad, and then there's like this bolt of energy for, like, 5 minutes where I have so much energy, but after it's gone, I just feel Disgusted inside I don't know why I happens or how it happens, but it's really been, it's been happening a lot, and I don't know what to do about it. I just I've lost motivation, I get mad easily, I've lost my confidence, and I also can't concentrate anymore. I don't even have it in me to study for finals. Guys, please help me out, if you read all this, thank you very much, I really appreciate it, I can't tell this to my parents because they'll just say that God will heal you, but I don't know, so please help me find out what the fucks wrong with me, lol love you Reddit bye bye",05May2019,8

101,"Over the past year or so, I have been increasingly growing in independence from my mother... and tensions have been escalating ever since. I'm 28, recently got a good job, and am loving life.

This has taken the form of the following:

* Buying my own food.
* Refusing to let her touch my laundry (we live in the same house but I pay my brother rent). I've told her a number of times that I don't want her doing my laundry, but she does it anyway.
* Not taking money from her.
* Setting boundaries regarding her reading my mail (i.e. stop doing that).
* Setting boundaries regarding what information she knows about regarding my illness.

Long story short, I grew up a very sick kid, always depending on my mother for  things... but now that I have a great job, it's like she simply cannot handle me being independent. She criticizes my purchases, she even said to my brother that she thinks that my door should be taken down because she hates talking through a door at me, etc. 

She just seems to outright hate me as a person now. Whenever I bring up any kind of criticism, she immediately throws her hands up and flies off the handle. I can't talk to her about anything now, unless it's about something regarding me needing her help, and she's there in a heartbeat. I can't talk about things she does that bother me because she dismisses them as ""insignificant"" or ""non-issues"", even though they really bothered me (i.e. her getting out after dropping me off at the mechanic and she decided to speak about my car's issues to the mechanic and embarrassed me, they both laughed at me calling a part by the wrong name).

I can't talk to her about my health problems because she worries, and flies off the handle. I can't talk to her about my relationships because she worries and flies off the handle. I don't like something she did? I can't tell her that, either, because she flies off the handle and comes up with excuse after excuse as to why she did it, and shifts the responsibility for her actions to me. ""You MADE ME fly off the handle!"", ""Your words MADE ME ANGRY"", ""I am overweight because I have thyroid problems/arthritis/etc"", etc. 

I try to talk to her about any problems I have and she just can't deal with it. She can't handle rejection, etc.

What could be wrong with her? Because the fact that my relationship is so strained with my mother is hurting me. It's like I don't have a loving mother anymore.",05May2019,2
102,"My background: Male, 17, I’ve experienced really terrible seasonal depression over the last couple of years during winter (I live in Wisconsin so it’s pretty much cold and cloudy for 4 months straight), and my family has all sorts of poor mental health history- schizophrenic mother, her father committed suicide, my father dealt with depression, his mom is pretty out there but has never had any diagnosis. My brother is in college but just dropped out due to suicidal thoughts, anxiety, paranoia, and is starting to become delusional. 

Anyways, over the last winter I sort of lost a sense of self-identity, and felt extreme insecurity. I exercised 5 times a week, ate healthy, got good sleep, took vitamin D supplements, but I still felt like absolute garbage everyday. Once the weather started to improve my mood began to fluctuate from being very low to being very vibrantly confident and outgoing. Now that I feel stable though, my sense of self is obliterated, but not in an insecure way. I just simply don’t feel an ego, or view myself as a person and try to fit that mold. It sounds like a good thing but at my age and at my school (very small public school with very wealthy kids excluding myself), I see my peers shaping into confident outgoing people who are very social but I feel...strange? I’m not trying to compare though- that’s not the main point. The main point is that last year after winter I became very sure of myself and always felt a compass emotionally, morally, logically... I had a lot of close relationships but now I feel brain dead in a way that I’ve never before which is scary to me. I don’t feel as much hopelessness or sadness, just...nothingness? I feel broken

I always miss out on family functions because of my stupid anxiety.

All I could think of is how much weight I've gained and what everyone is thinking of me due to that. How family is going to ask how I'm doing? What's new? Dating anyone yet? How's work going?

And thinking of my sitting there so uncomfortable in my own skin not wanting anyone to look at me let alone talk to me. Sitting there for 4 hours. 4 hours of nothing but my dealing with social anxiety and trying not to cry the whole time. 

And I just can't.

I can't sit there and talk about how all my life revolves around right now is eating disorders and therapy, suicide ideation and therapy, anxiety / panic attacks and therapy, working only a few shifts a month and therapy, feeling sad all the time and therapy, fighting myself on not indulging again with self harm and therapy. 

I can't sit there for 4 hours and put on a smile and act like everything is great and put on a show of confidence that I know I'm not fooling anyone with.

It hurt so badly, that I ended up breaking my sobriety, cutting myself, I posted on r/suicidewatch took a handful of sleeping pills and then the police showed up at my door.

All I got was side effects that made things worse and hooked on benzos.

119,"I get anxiety at the prospect of having to go out and socialise with my friends or colleagues. Does anyone else get these kind of feelings? 

I'd rather sit alone and read about politics or listen to podcasts. 

There are two sides to this. For the past 8 years my life has been work, my partner and the many responsibilities in my personal life (looking after friends and family). My family have needed lots of support over the years - and so have my friends. The majority og my time is spent going to see them or doing something for them. It feels like work away from work.

Years of this has made my friendships very one sided, usually with a dependency on me. I am reliable but I am always extremely drained and socially akward in informal settings, to the extent I try to avoid them completely. I have been able to justify this social aloofness to myself when it comes to work socialising because the idea of drinking (with people I wouldn't bother with if we didnt work together), gossiping about whoever isn't there and talking about what was on tv last night is hell on earth to me.

The problem is that the longer this has gone on it has left me on a very different wave length to other people around my age and not much to talk about in social settings because I don't want to discuss the stuff that's actually on my mind which is usually stress.  I feel like a weirdo.

The other side to this is that I have had some terrible experiences on nights out - on one occasion a boss told someone not to spend too much time with me because I was boring and I would stop them having fun.

Most of the time i'm able to hide this anxious / insecure side of me but if i'm out for too long I will take myself out of the situation quickly. Noone knows this side of me because I don't want to appear weak as if I do i'm worried that I'll be unable to help those who need it.

120,"I’m posting this because it opened my eyes and maybe it can help someone else. 

It really surprised my how difficult it is to diagnose bipolar spectrum instead of just chronic depression. This seems to be because most people (including myself) rarely go to their psychiatrist complaining about a manic episode (it’s hard to tell you’re having one unless someone tells you, otherwise it’s just brief period of feeling ‘normal’, and if where you are on the spectrum results in more depressive episodes than manic it’s even harder). 

I spent years trying different antidepressants with none of them having any positive impact on my life. I was feeling so hopeless that nothing could help me that I felt worse than ever, like there would never be a way out. 

Luckily (my third psychiatrist) decided to experiment by giving me a mood stabilizer (Lamictal) instead of an antidepressant. Within a day I could tangibly feel it lifting my brain out of the darkness I felt I was stuck in. I had never taken a medication that I could actually tangibly feel helping me before and it helped confirm the diagnosis.

I'm thinking about it realistically probably 30% of the time but it feels like more than that. Even when I'm at school or trying to play games, I can't do well because I'm thinking about my mental health. For example, I'll have a thought because of SA and obsess over that thought, what it means, could it be more than SA, etc. It doesn't cause worry, but the overthinking definately gets in the way of me enjoying my life, it was the main reason my first relationship eneded. I've been thinking like this the past few months (4 or 5) and now it's to the point where I just can't imagine what's going through a normal person's head when they're watching TV, playing games, other everyday stuff. I got a job because I figured it'd help with the SA and doing something would be a distraction from constantly thinking about my mental health, it did help with the SA but not the overthinking about my mental health. I do a lot of research about mental health conditions since I obsess over it, seeing if anything can apply to me, and I feel like after I read something I start to  act or think like someone with whatever condition, then I overthink that.

125,"

I’m going into an intensive ED day hospital program starting tomorrow. I’ve had to have all sorts of psychological, psychotherapy and dietitian evaluations done this past week, to develop my program nutrition plan, and identify comorbid symptoms (I have severe depression and anxiety and some symptoms of OCD, as well as a body focused repetitive disorder). This is so they can support me in the program because targeting EDs can bring about other mental health symptoms during the program. 

I’m kind of freaking out because it starts tomorrow and like I want to recover and have been on the wait list for months, but I’m also scared as hell. 

Anyways, I had to fill out a pre treatment questionnaire before I start my ED program tomorrow. I had to fill out this section on PTSD and apparently I scored 57 (33 is the cutoff for a provisional PTSD diagnosis. Whaaaaat. The traumatic events were from 2 insanely bad practicum placements in the summer of 2017 and winter 2018. The first placement I worked as an unpaid intern working 70+hours per week, sleeping 4hours per night. I started self harming and got insanely depressed and suicidal. Also I was like 4000 km away from home and both my aunt and grandma died within a week of each other during that practicum. 

For the second placement I had two clinical educators, one was super nice and one was fucking shit. She told me constantly that I sucked and that I wouldn’t make a good speech therapist. She verbally abused me and embarrassed me in front of clients and their parents. I would cry myself to sleep at night and one day I had to go home early because I had a panic attack because I couldn’t handle the thought of having to work with her anymore. I almost failed my practicum because she said I wasn’t meeting my clinical competencies, but I ended up just fucking working 200% and passing. It was a nightmare. I avoid the location of the placement at all costs, and I have dreams about her that wake me up in cold sweats. I refuse to even apply for jobs at that location because I don’t want to ever see her again. If I’m in public and I see someone who looks even remotely like her, I panic. 
But fuck her because I’m a fully licensed and registered speech pathologist (speech therapist) now (even though I haven’t started to work in the field yet due to mental health issues).

But....

I thought PTSD was like for people who have had serious trauma, like car accidents, physical/sexual abuse, war experiences etc. I feel like my “traumatic experience” is me just being soft and  that it’s not legit. 

Anyways, I have to hand in the forms tomorrow, but we will see what comes out of that. It did say “provisional” diagnosis. I feel like I’m being a wuss.

I’ve never considered that I could have PTSD before from something as trivial as bad practicum placements, and so it will be interesting to see what happens in terms of therapies and diagnoses. (I know it can take a while to get diagnosed and that other tests have to be run). 

Thanks for listening to my rant, I needed to get that out.",05May2019,1

Since some time, I've felt depresive, as if there's not real meaning in life, also disconform with myself. I don't know why to work or even why to live. I made a promise that I won't try to suicide until some time (several years) has passed and I don't make progress with my mental health.  


The other thing is anxiety. I couldn't finish the computer engineering because I exceeded the time to finish it. When I was working on software proyects, and a deadline arrives (usually to report progress)  I had anxiety attacks and when I tried to finish social service in the university at the development department, it came a point where I couldn't continue for anxiety. Questions like ""What if I do it wrong?"" ""What if I can't do it?"" ""What if all I do here is just a failure?"" were in my mind. The last semester I consulted with the university psychologist and she told me that I might need medications.  


Some time passed and I find that job of assistant in warehouse, and when I went to the job interview, I have felt some anxiety and now, that I'm working and my supervisor sent me a fault of mine, I felt more anxiety that ruins my mood for the rest of the day (but not the enough for an anxiety attack).",05May2019,1

131,"[Article Link](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/4/18528349/depression-music-sad-emotion-psychology-health)

People with depression listen to sad music because it makes them feel better, according to a small study that is one of the first to investigate why people turn to tearjerkers when they’re already down.

The first part of the study, published recently in the journal Emotion, tried to repeat the findings of a 2015 study that showed that depressed people preferred listening to sad music. Researchers at the University of South Florida asked 76 female undergrads (half of them were diagnosed with depression) to listen to various classical music clips. “Happy” music included Jacques Offenbach’s cheerful “Infernal Gallop,” and “sad” music included Samuel Barber’s “Adagio for Strings,” which is almost universally considered to be extremely depressing. The scientists found that, like in the 2015 study, participants with depression indicated they would rather listen to sad music than happy music. 

Then, the researchers gave the participants new clips of happy and sad instrumental music and asked them to describe how the tracks made them feel. Again, the depressed participants preferred the sad music, but they also stated that the sad music made them feel happier. “They actually were feeling better after listening to this sad music than they were before,” study co-author Jonathan Rottenberg told WUSF News. It seemed to have relaxing and calming effects. This challenges the assumption that sad people listen to sad music to make themselves feel worse, when, in fact, it may be a coping mechanism.

Of course, there are many limitations. This is a small study that only looked at female undergraduates, so the results should be taken with a grain of salt. (Psychology, in general, tends to use WEIRD — Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic — subjects too often.) We don’t have a lot of detail regarding exactly why people with depression prefer sad music, and we don’t know how results might change with happy and sad music that has words.

However, it’s an intriguing finding that does replicate some earlier research and could have implications for fields such as music therapy. In this intervention, trained music therapists incorporate music into their interactions with patients by singing, listening to music, or playing music together. It has been used for everything from pain relief to helping cancer patients, and a 2017 Cochrane review of the evidence suggested that it had at least short-term benefits for patients with depression. Though there is no “most common” type of music used in music therapy, the programs can often include instruments like guitars and drums. In the future, maybe there will be a greater focus on sorrowful songs.",05May2019,1

A lot of the things that happened were like 5 years ago and I considered just not mentioning them to the psychiatrist.

Modafinil: I could hardly get an erection om that drug, it was rare for me to reach orgasm. The only reason I stopped was because it made very aggressive and couldn't sleep right at night.

142,"So let me start this off with a little background. Grew up with two sibling's older brother (30s) and sister(34+), our brother I(27) haven't kept in touch with so not sure his stance on our family.  Our mother abused my sister and I never our brother. Father died of cancer when I was a teenager. 

He has 5 brothers and sisters (so my aunt's and uncles) all of which made plenty more money than our part of the family. These aunt's and uncles also have their own kids roughly same ages as my siblings and I. 

However during my dad's sickness only two uncle's stepped in, they work in medical field and flew him around the country for new chemo treatments to try and help but it was too severe. 
His other siblings never stepped in more than a phone call. Me grandfather was already elder and too old to travel but he knew it was close to time and during one of the trips where my uncle flew my father to another treatment he also flew me to go stay close to him and mty grandfather until they released him from the treatment and flew back home. I still relatively keep in touch with these two uncles. 

However, once my dad died not a single person from his side of the family attended the funeral. 
Yet, they still on social media talk about how amazing my father was and some even talk about how they knew the things our mother did to my sister and I. 
Yet, they never stepped in. They don't even reach out to me, my aunt was in my state recently within a 10 minute drive. Never reached out even after I sent a text.

Now, for whatever reason my sister has a weird (in my eyes) attachment to the word family. Like this is the biggest thing in the world for her, even stayed with a druggy abusive cheating husband because he's her kids father's and that's ""family."" 
I see things differently. I see family as people who actually care for your health and happiness and are there for the bad and the good, wether related or not. 

She's the only member of the family I visit, once a year but I'm switching it to every other year, she doesn't know yet, because I just can't handle her drama and her kids. (I also don't like kids, don't have them, and have ensured I won't get pregnant.) As well as I want to travel to new places, see the world and be happy, without two gross offsprings dirtying everything and screaming and arguing v

I'm not too active on social media, they know this so my sister usually texts me important things, but I log in and see that side of the family has tagged me in a family reunion photo from when I was a baby and everyone begins rambling on about recreating this photo but now with all the grandkids and whatever offspring involved. After a day of them chatting about when and where with no response from me, the where is also somewhere I'd never really desire to go especially with this many kids, I get tagged in a comment they've decided a date and a location. 

Little do they know right now I'm looking at places to vacation for that date and not going to respond when my sister reaches out to me to confirm as she already gave a headcount including me in her ""OMG we're so in!!!1!” plans. 

I know I haven't forgiven them for never showing up to my father's funeral nor do I plan to, they didn't  even send a card, or flowers. 

And I'm okay with this. The only way it seems to affect my life is it's helped me realize blood means nothing, and that I need to take care of myself mentally and physically and keep myself happy however it may be even if it is petty.

146,"Symptoms = sxs

I'm curious as to how many people have experienced sxs like these or could share the ones that apply to them.  I have recently abandoned my denial of the sxs and discussing them seems to bring an amount of comfort.

For example, the other day I heard a snatch similar to Beethoven's seventh symphony quietly playing inside of my floor vent when the AC turned on.  While in high background noise environments I will sometimes hear my name called when there is nobody to call it.  Before sleep I commonly experience something crawling on me and see strange pulsating shapes with my eyes closed.  When walking barefoot through the house I will sometimes feel something crawl across my foot always when I stop to do something.  The other day at the store I couldn't look anyone in the eye and I knew they were all judging my appearance (which was quite unkempt at the time) and had a wild desire to abandon my groceries and bolt from the store.

I'm sure you can see how these trivial deviations from the norm were much easier for me to write off than something major like seeing a demon or hearing a voice tell me to do something.  That's just what I've been doing....ignoring them.

Stress over losing a job recently and the prospect of going to a homeless shelter seems to have dramatically increased these sxs along with radical mood shifts (3 times a day sometimes).

I have diagnoses of BPD/EUPD, an autoimmune disorder, and pronounced weakness in my left side from trauma. I also have Complex PTSD with a few triggers which are relevant to this story.

On Saturdays I volunteer with a Surf School which teaches kids who have been through similar crap to me (Child Sex Abuse, Trauma, etc.) and last week we were coasteering (rock climbing, and jumping into the sea)

When I was 14, I saw a kid die 'tombstoning' (jumping into the sea off cliffs - it's really common here) and the whole time when we were coasteering I was having flashbacks and a general bad time even though I knew it was safe. This made my autoimmune Disorder flare up and basically my left side stopped working - obviously I needed a bit of help getting out of the water and stuff.

So this week when I turned up they didn't let me get in a wetsuit or anything even though we were surfing this week, which I am perfectly confident doing (I've completed nationally FFS), and so I flipped or at the surf school, because it just seemed completely unfair.

151,"I live a few hours away from my parents. My brother lives near my parents, so when I visit my parents I usually see him some too. I visit roughly once every couple of months, and most holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, my birthday, my brother's birthday, and my parents' birthdays). I have two wonderful parents and a really cool brother. The problem is, is that I fall into a deep depression every time I see them because their current life situations are basically awful. I am bipolar, and depressive episodes can be bad. On top of that, I'm battling agoraphobia, and my husband can't always go with me when I visit family, and driving by myself is a huge anxiety-producing activity. Because my dad might be dying, I try to visit even more often now.

My brother's wife talks non-stop, spends literally all the money she makes on stupid shit, and doesn't even interact with their 4 kids much. My brother works 3 jobs to make ends meet, and is over 400 lbs (which I still don't understand b/c he literally doesn't eat breakfast or lunch so he can save money to feed his kids). He had a nutritionist who had him weigh everything he ate, and she literally told him his metabolism was just shot and she couldn't do anything for him... who knows.. Obviously I've never heard of a nutritionist doing that to anyone in the past, but she literally let him go as a client. When my brother is at my parents' house, he scarfs food because he literally feels like he's starving, and it's the saddest shit, even though I cognitively know he could probably got months without food and survive. Supposedly he even goes a day or so without eating at all sometimes because his wife makes dinner after he leaves for his second job. (I won't lie, I kind of hate her, but I try my best to seem like I really like her for his sake. I've even helped her clean up after hosting events at their house and stuff like that). Oh yeah, and he has an autistic, non-verbal 7 year old son who is giant (not overweight, but super muscular), and in my opinion, kind of scary since he can push you, bite you, pull your hair, etc. My brother said he can survive on the 5ish hours he gets to sleep every night, but he's the type of person that always seemed to need 8-9 hours of sleep.

My dad was morbidly obese as well, until his liver started to fail, and now he's skinnier than I am (I'm a smallish female). He's had multiple heart attacks, heart surgery, and might be getting his legs amputated soon due to some complications. They live in a tiny house because they also can't afford life anymore, even thought they both had good jobs prior to retiring. If he ends up wheelchair bound, I have no idea how he can navigate that tiny house. My childhood home is lost, and that is depressing itself. The last time I visited, I was there for almost 2 weeks because my dad was in the hospital, and they weren't sure he was coming home. Thankfully his condition improved, but as you can imagine, it was a really hard time watching him deteriorate.

So, I have no intention of stopping my visits to my family because they're wonderful people, but I don't know how to cope with those same visits. Everything about seeing my parents and my brother is painful, and honestly, pitiful. I come home and feel so horrible I literally don't want to move for days, even if I'm super helpful and hard working when I'm with my parents (sometimes I help them clean, fix things, or run errands since I know it's hard for them now). That tells me I *can* be productive, so I don't know why it's so hard when I get home. On top of it, my brother who has a severe anxiety disorder and chronic pain from another issue, is working so hard, while I don't work at all, making me feel like useless garbage. My husband assures me that he's okay with me not working, but often my house isn't even clean, so I honestly have no excuse. My parents always tell me I'm this ""amazing"" ""sweet"" person, and I don't feel like I am. So many people are depressed because their family sucks, and I feel like I should just be able to be grateful that I grew up in such a loving environment, but I just feel so exhausted when I return home from my visits.

The rear differential also has something ""wrong"" with it, but that doesn't need to be fixed for thousands of more miles, and he didnt want us to have to put in the cash to fix it before a vacation.

&amp;#x200B;

He, and everyone around me has assured me that the car is safe, functional, and perfectly fine. The car passed inspection in NY, and is road ready. However I CAN NOT get it out of my head that were going to break down on the road. He works with cars for a living, he knows what hes doing, both my partners have assured me as well, but it just won't leave. Like a constant cycling thought. I'm also afraid of crashing on the road, and getting hit by another car. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know, rationally, the likelihood of getting into an accident is very slim. My partner has been driving for years, he's driven this route every year for the past three, were leaving and driving at hours when the roads aren't busy, etc etc. But again, it's just STUCK in my head. Everyone, all my friends are looking forward to this trip, everyone's excited to get on the road. But here I am worrying my head off over trivial things that aren't likely to happen at all. Typing this out as a vent has helped a little, because at least I can get my thoughts down, but if anyone knows any good coping skills for cycling thoughts, that'd be great to hear too.",05May2019,1
153,"hello fellow people, 
I feel like I can't find reasons as to why should I do this or that. I'm 20, not in university at the moment, but taking admissional exams in a month and something. I feel weird. the only goal I can think of in my life is to not having to worry about anything and just live through days. I feel like I kind of want to get into the university (medical) and learn but I haven't been studying well enough, so now I'm filled up with anxiety about wasting more of my life due to my own stupidity. it's not that I'm stupid, it's just I can't bring myself to actually study. I read books, watch drama,etc instead. but that doesn't exactly make me happy at the end of the day and it doesn't earn money. in all honesty, I think that if nothing would be affected I'd probably disappear from lives of my family and closest and travel far away, so that they would have to worry about me anymore. it's just... I don't know. maybe through this post I could ease up a little, will see tomorrow morning.",05May2019,1
154,"Hello fellow redditors, this topic is unfortunately common and you might get this question a lot but how can you cure or possibly cope with depression especially when things keep getting worse from family complications to grades and friends at school and  not being able to socialize (being boring and just not being able to make good interesting and funny convos)... P.s I won't disclose my age but I'm in high school...  I am a Canadian

155,"Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

I am kinda torn.. I am in the process of getting assesed for autism.. tho the stress at home is making my depression worse which is  making me suicidal... I kinda of want to admit myself ot the psych ward but doing so, would stop the assessment and it is reaaaaaaaaaaaaaally hard to get one if you are an adult, here.  

So I don't know what to do.. do I continue to suffer and get assessed or do I admit myself and not get assessed?",05May2019,0

157,"I'm sorry if this wasnt the right place to post this but it seemed fitting. Lately I've been really unmotivated to do anything. The one thing that really messes me up though is that I've started ""living dreaming"" what I mean by that is most of the day goes by where I'm half asleep daydreaming about doing things then suddenly snap out of it to just go back and repeat the a cycle. Anyone have this and if so what do you do to counteract it.",05May2019,2

159,"Hey! First poster here. So the title says it all, everyone in my life (family, friends, even my therapist) thinks that I'm doing well, but my mental health is the worst it's ever been in my life. Some context, I've had mental health issues since I was first diagnosed with an eating disorder 5 years ago. Since then I've also been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I am incredibly high functioning. I'm an ivy league college student with a 3.5 gpa, numerous extracurriculars, social life, romantic life, etc. My life is great right? But, my mental health is the worst it's ever been. I've had 5 major anxiety attacks since the school year started and sometimes (like today) I'm so depressed I hardly leave my room. I've told my close friends and my therapist how bad my mental health is but they all think that I'm fine because the rest of my life is so good. What will happen if my mental health gets worse and my ""perfect life"" starts to suffer? What should I do?",05May2019,4
160,"Im so tired. I have 4 AP exams in the next two weeks, and I'm not prepared for the two that are this week because my.teachers for those classes are actually crap. Then on the friday after the week of ap exams, finals start and I'm just so stressed. By the end of the month of may, I'll have written 7 essays and finished writing 9.
Also, i need to get at least a 90% in my history class so that i can take ap econ next year
Then in the month of july, i have an academic competition in europe that I'm not prepared for at all bc my coach doesn't do crap and i have a business program to attend that i signed up for on a whim
Just my entire summer, I also have to start planning collges over the summer and writing essays and i have no idea where i want to go or what i want to do and I'm so stressed. I also have to take sat subject tests and if my sat score isn't good, I'll have to take the sat again in August. 
I'm just so tired and i really wish i had like a close friend to talk about this with, but i don't so I'm ranting on here.",05May2019,1
161,"Since a very long time I'm having some sort of mental issues. They never were adressed clinically since I never been to a specialist (which is about to change very soon) and it's pretty hard for me to define them. By reading internet articles I can diagnoze myself with shittone of things, which is not really uplifting neither, and in overall I'm just clueless about those issues because it's hard to say what can be really true.

I don't want to list all of the things, but I'm curious about one that is happening to me right in the moment while writing this. 

I was spending this evening as usual as always, sitting in front of my computer, playing some games or browsing through internet, feeling a bit upset since some time ago I decided to cut off any contacts with a person very dear to me which left a huge mark on my life. (a whole different story that doesn't belong here) Suddenly I started feeling more uneasy than usual. Almost felt like I was about to fall off from a cliff and just die. My heart rate increased, felt incredible amount of fear and panic all around me even though nothing was happening at the moment. It became a harsh feeling that just made me feel incredibly lonely, scared and pointless about my life in one second and I couldn't do nothing about it.

This ain't the first time when it happened, however with not such intensity. And this was also happening before certain event that made me feel upset lately, so that's not completely the case, however there's a chance that it made me feel much worse and make the symptoms more intense. 

Usually doing certain things can help me to get through this and everything goes back to normal state, but today it kept with me for over an hour, laying curled in bed surrounded by plushies, which at least helped my heart to stop pounding so badly. (sounds silly I know xd). 

This sort of thing usually happens in places filled with lots of people, or when I just don't want to be in a certain (most of the times it's school or church). Sometimes I need to get out of the place and breath some fresh air to calm myself down and it's slowly going back to normal, for most of the accidents at least.

Does this mean I have some sort of anxiety? 

I know that looking for diagnoses on reddit is not exactly the best and it's not really the point, and also I'm visting a doctor in 9 days so probably I'll find out anyway, but I'm still looking for other answers just to get the wider image of what is happening to me.",05May2019,1
162,"I’ve heard of BPD before but never looked into it until yesterday. I feel like as an HSP, we may experience similar things and I can’t tell if I’m just an HSP or possibly have BPD. Some of the symptoms I relate to are paranoid thoughts (like this person doesn’t like me, this person thinks I’m weird, etc), fear of abandonment, feeling empty often, intense emotions and mood swings (with anger though it’s not as often and definitely not in front of people), this has gotten a little better but when I was younger, I’d ALWAYS feel like nobody truly understands me. Looking back at my tumblr posts, I was such a dramatic person venting out all my feelings and frustrations and I can’t tell if that’s just me going through puberty, being highly sensitive or BPD. If I wasn’t a Christian, I’d probably engage in the risky, impulsive behaviors. I wouldn’t say my relationships are unstable. However, I do have mixed feelings a lot in my friendships thinking things like “if they don’t do this or if they do that, they don’t care about me or love me.” 

&amp;#x200B;

Also I struggle a bit with social anxiety so this could relate to some things. But yeah I’m kind of confused and don’t know if I should see a psychiatrist to get properly diagnosed. Can anyone who relates share their experiences?",05May2019,0
163,"The rest of my family have given up trying to help. I'm 25 but don't know what to do.   

He calls the police multiple times a week for anything that he doesn't agree with or inconveniences him in any way. The police do nothing so they're 'corrupt'.  

He thinks his neighbours are out to get him. He's starting fights and says one day he's going to kill them ""in self defence"". He seems serious.  

The mh team discharged him with no help so they're corrupt too. Apparently they're secretly working with his housing association who are also corrupt and out to get him. He says they're all abusing him. He calls the mh team and his housing association so often that they won't talk to him anymore.  

He thinks he's taking multiple organisations to court for a range of reasons. He has piles of letters and 'evidence' of abuse and corruption.  

Last week he came over and was describing all of the different ways of committing suicide and ranking which would have the highest chance of working. He described in so much detail that I still feel sick.  

I have my own mental health problems and I don't want to hear my own dad tell me he's going to kill people and describing suicide in so much detail. I will be moving to a new mh team soon and he's telling me how corrupt and abusive they are. It's really messing with my head.  

He clearly needs some help but the mh team refuse to talk to him as he's been discharged. It doesn't help that he calls and shouts at them. I have no idea what to do, the rest of my family aren't interested, I lost my mum a few years ago and I'm trying so hard to look after myself right now.",05May2019,1
