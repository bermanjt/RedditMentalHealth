0,"Hello I have been having worrisome things happen to me lately and wonder if someone is experiencing the same things, or knows whats wrong with me

Over the pass few months I hear footsteps sounds like someone is walking around but when I go take a look around nothing is around but the sounds return.

The more recent thing is I hear voices its always sounds like a nice ladies voice, it usually says simple short things like from the ones i remember:
-""Are you awake?""
-""What are you doing?!""
It said other things but I couldnt understand it or it sounded like just random sounds

The latest thing thats been happening is I see things pretty often in the corners of my eyes, its usually looks like someone standing.

I'vw noticed that this happens more often during the night and not the day. Is it just so called tiredness or should I be more worried ?

3,"Long story short: I'm taking Buproprion to ward off depression.  I couldn't get the usual 24-hour Buproprion XL on my last refill (medication shortage), so the doctor authorized a 12-hour SR pill.  


Six weeks later, I went to the walk-in clinic with unexpected and hard-to-control crying.  The doctor said that my depression was okay, but my anxiety was 'a bit on the high side', and thankfully reset my prescription for XL.  


Since I've started taking XL again (last week), my emotions have been wobbly.  I'm constantly worried about my age, I'm crying at random moments, and it's hard to get through the day without feeling 'blah'.  


To be clear, I'm not planning to hurt myself or anyone else.  I just can't shake this roller coaster -- 'okay' one moment, 'slightly blue' the next morning, terrified and anxious the next (I started an application at a local work-placement center, but had to walk for half an hour when my password wouldn't reset).  


So -- is this (relatively) normal for switching from SR to XL?  How long will it last?  Will I ever really enjoy my life again?  I'm asking for myself, and for the sake of my girlfriend, who is having a hard time with her employment and needs as much support as possible.  I'm worried that I won't be able to help her as much as she needs if this is going to be 'the new normal'.",02Mar2019,3

I start punching myself repeatedly for a few seconds. it's resulted in bruises. Another symptom seems to be hallucinations both auditory and visual

Other impulses I've had include a desire to cut myself, voices in my voices in my head, spasms anger at people confusion bouncing letters

I've been going to a therapist but seem to leave more stressed than relieved",02Mar2019,1
5,"I constantly feel like everyone else is enjoying their lives so much more than I'm enjoying mine. This is something I spend a lot of my day thinking about. I can get kind of obsessive about trying to gauge how happy other people are because I'm trying to figure out what the normal level of happiness to feel is. I feel like I've spent so much time doing this and I still don't understand if I'm normal or not as happy as other people.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In short it seems I can't attract a partner (for now) for romance or sex that I'm interested in. Most of my friends (in my department) are having a much better time on these apps and meeting girls all the time (we're all straight).

7,"At school for English we have a presentation everyone needs to do to pass our tests, and it's horrible. Everyone does presentations, everyone gets nervous about them, I've been through much much worse, why am I so affected by it? We had so long to prepare for it too, but because of my lack of motivation I didn't, so it's my fault. I eventually made a few notes for the thing I wanted to present because we aren't allowed a full script. I was nervous, but nothing too bad, but the second my teacher called my name I panicked really badly, and made up an excuse. I did this a few times, strangly the time I was most confident was the time I started crying when the teacher called for me. Luckily no one saw as my head was down and it was only a few tears. Everyone was really annoyed with me that time too, which made it worse.
It's been really stressing me out and I've been self loathing much worse than normal. And it's not optional so it's not like I can just hand in a note like last time to not do it, I'll have to do it eventually. I'm having trouble sleeping, which hasn't happened in almost a year. I've been crying randomly (nothing bad just a few tears), which also hasn't happened in almost a year, which was the time I was in a traumatic situation. Like, brain, making a presentation that lasts for 4 minutes is very different from trauma, what are you doing??? Other people are nervous and you've cried in front of them before anyway and they already hate you so it's not like anything will change, so can you stop being so weak? I'm crying right now writing this just thinking of it, why am I such a failure?

I don't have anyone to talk to this about, so I'm just venting here. But if anyone has any advice to give, please help. Why am I so upset about this? How do I stop it? ",02Mar2019,2

Why is it I want to be depressed? I want to just be able to just disappear and isolate. I know this is just so unhealthy but I just want to be able to give up. Why am I feeling this way? Why do I want to be depressed. There has to be something mentally wrong with me to want something bad like that. ",02Mar2019,2
9,"I lost my father and my grandmother at 18, and my mother and great grandmother at 20. All of these individuals were very important in my childhood in one capacity or another.  They all died in separate incidences, and the deaths of my parents were sudden and unexpected.

For reasons I do not wish to dive deeply into, I've been significantly emotionally detached from family since I could remember. I didn't display much reaction during these events. I also didn't witness their deaths personally. 

For about 6 months after my father died I went into something like a dissociated state. I thought I might have been schizoid at the time, although later emotional outbursts would demonstrate otherwise. I've had all sorts of mental health issues from that time forward in varying severity, usually in connection with current stressors, that I did not experience before all of this.

I'm 27 now and I've only recently started really thinking about how these events might have been traumatic, but from my understanding if I didn't actually witness the events and also considering my general detachment from them, can it actually be traumatic? As a tangential question, if you feel hopeless for very extended periods of time, can that be considered traumatic, or is that a separate sort of thing?",02Mar2019,1
10,"I know that this post is a bit different than other posts on here, but I hope that you can still give me your insights. The way I'm writing it sounds a bit like a Quora question, but I know that I won't get an answer in a decent amount of time on there, plus I feel a bit safer in this community. (I've been a lurker without posting or even making an account.)

When I dream, look back at my memories, or even just think of doing something, I always see myself in 3rd person. It's not like a movie or anything, it's more like being a ghost floating a couple feet behind someone. I always thought this was normal, but I recently found out it wasn't. I  tried looking for answers, but sadly, I didn't find much. The only thing I found was that I could be a symptom for DID, but I don't believe I have it because I don't recall experiencing any form of trauma or abuse throughout my life.  I'll just list the things I do have, in case it helps you give me your insight:

\--Dysthymia

\-OCD (Currently the symptoms are currently mild enough, but expected to get worse throughout life:/)

\-OLP (A form of synesthesia )

\-Social Anxiety

\-Tinnitus

11,"I am a 23 year old female design student, studying fashion design. I feel like I've made a lot of choices that I didn't intend to make during my time in college. Many of which, brought wonderful, incredible things, people, and experiences into my life. I don't particularly regret anything, but I don't know if I'm doing what's right for me right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be graduating this spring, but I actually have to petition the school (sounds intense but is just a paper that I have to fill out, a lot of people do this) to walk across the graduation stage as I actually still need to fulfill the requirement of three liberal arts courses that I didn't take on time due to an attempted double major that re-arranged my credits, and a medical condition that required surgery one semester and the need for a reduced course load. Either way, I will not truly be graduating on the day of graduation. I will either have a false sense of satisfaction, or feel like a total fraud. Either way, I know that I will begrudgingly attend to these additional classes online and struggle to get through them in the summer when I feel like I should be moving on with my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have to create 6 looks for our thesis collection, and we have 8 weeks left to do them. I really jumped around the previous semester, not being able to decide on what to make, not being happy with my work, and not feeling passionate about my concept. Senior year is our year. It's a time totally dedicated to our thesis collection which is basically our calling card and portfolio as we enter into the industry. The school has a fashion show, and then we show at NYFW in the fall. It's important. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you are unfamiliar with making clothing, it is a lot of work, a lot of fittings, a lot of time, a lot of effort, and a lot of money. We do not outsource in our program so all clothing is made 100% by us. I spent the final two weeks of last semester, struggling and very behind in the timeline of things, to create three complete looks. I didn't sleep, didn't eat, took a lot of adderall, and napped in my car for an hour at a time during the day. This seems totally psychotic, but if you've ever been to, or even seen art school from afar, it isn't. It's a lifestyle and somewhat of a competition. Fortunately I had a car to sleep in, because other students were sleeping under their desks in studio and not leaving for days at a time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt like shit after all of that. Instead of staying for our mini winter semester, I got an internship in LA with a fashion house and worked with them on their collection for fashion week. I enjoyed this a lot, it was nice to be away. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another factor in my stress is my relationship with one of my roommates, who is also in my department, all of my classes, and my friend group. She has resented me for the past year and a half and treated me terribly due to this. Her resentment stems from my relationship with my boyfriend (who I will talk about in a second) which makes me happy, and she's unhappy and wants me to be unhappy with her. She has started conflict with me time and time again, apologized for her actions, and then gone straight back to her antics once more. I never spoke to our friend group about this because I didn't want them to treat us differently or exclude on of us and invite the other to avoid discomfort. I thought that they just sensed that something was off, but didn't truly know. Well, it turns out that they do know, because she's been bitching to them about me for the past year and a half. This came to light the other day when one of my friends confronted me about it, asking why I never spoke up and wanted to reassure me that none of them believe what she says.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be one thing if this was just a classmate or a colleague, but she lives in my house, I can't get away. It's really bringing me down. She nit-picks everything that I do and tries to micro-manage me. It's exhausting.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend is the next topic. He's a wonderful human being. We are in a committed international long distance relationship and get to visit one another every month, it's pretty good. While being apart is hard, we have so many wonderful times together that it's worth the time apart. We lived together in London this past summer, where I literally just went, we moved in together, he had an internship and I didn't have anything but I built an entire life for myself through a school, connections that I made, and eventually got an internship, all on my own, with no help or prior planning. It gave me a lot of confidence in myself. We want to move in with one another this spring when we both graduate, we're very serious about each other and our relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend is also a design student and is very talented, put together, and responsible. He's getting everything done, making awesome work, and in the interview process with several notable design firms. I'm very proud of him and excited about these prospects.. and I feel like I'm letting him down.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel immobilized by my stress. I feel like I can't work. I can't focus. I think that I actually have undiagnosed ADHD, my whole family does, and it's really kicking me right now when I have to be self motivated and the time is running out. I think that this is something that I really need to  look into, and should have earlier on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like if I had more time for my work I would be in a better position.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like taking a leave of absence and re-visiting everything in a year would be good for me... but I'm also worried about several things....

1. I really want to graduate and have a *graduation.* I never have before. I got mono so badly in high school that I had to be home schooled and then finish with community college courses and take my GED test. My family really wants to see me graduate, they're all booking plane tickets soon.
2. I want to get out of here as soon as possible. I feel like I have outgrown this school, and this city. This is one of the top three design schools but the city is small and boring and it makes me sad. I feel like if I spent another semester, or year here I would be incredibly depressed.
3. I want to move forward with my relationship. This is something that makes me happy and that I'm really excited for post-graduation. It's a motivating factor. I don't want to be long distance anymore and I want to work hard to make my boyfriend happy. This wouldn't work if I had to come back to finish school.
4. My friends would be gone, I do have a few friends that are either on 5 year programs or have taken time off themselves and are set to graduate in 2020... I wouldn't be totally alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also... school is crushing me. I used to find happiness in my art. I used to be motivated to work on it all day and all night through my own drive to create and that has totally been stomped out of me. I used to make clothing, I made my own prom dress from scratch, dyed it, patterned it, and sewed it in one day. It was hard work but I loved every second of it. I stayed up all night but I didn't mind. I used to draw, all the time. Drawing is my thing, something that I am really, really good at. It brought me joy, I was relatively popular on internet communities... which I have totally abandoned since pursing an art degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like if I took time off, I would start working for my own happiness again. I actually see myself creating more, being motivated, and maybe even developing a career. But then I wouldn't come back. I wouldn't get my degree.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know. I do know that I am miserable. I feel guilty for wasting my parents money. I feel like a totally incapable human being. The last time I was this depressed was when I was recovering from mono and physically couldn't do anything. Normally I am a really happy, confident person and right now I totally don't feel like myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am set to hand my thesis collection in in 8 weeks.. other than the classes that I still have to take.. I am technically done... but it feels like an insurmountable task. I know that it's normal to stress out senior year but I do truly feel like I need more time.

I (20f) have struggled with mental health for most of my short life. It has gotten extremely bad the past two years which caused my-impulsive-self to make some drastic changes in my life. At this point, I feel extremely lost and so god damn broken. I have terrible jealousy issues, my relationship with my mother is almost non-existence aside from when she tries to give me money (trying to buying my love, seriously woman?), i do not know how to have a relationship with women because of this, my relationship with my father is great--except when my mother is around because she is extrenely jealous of our relationship. She was close to her father and guess what! Her mother was extremely jealous of their relationship. I feel like I am going psychotic and the only person even remotely aware is my boyfriend. I have thought through most of our relationship that he was mentally absuing me and then BAM guess fucking what! After a long conversation, it turns out that i am fucking delusional.

13,"Hello. I’m 19 years old

All my life the biggest emotion in my body has been fear. Scared of getting into trouble, scared of death, scared of pain etc and this has sort of just continued into my adult life 

I am so scared that it hurts. My whole body feels cold and I’m shaking. The feeling of being scared is literally causing me physical pain. I became so scared of dying last year that the only way I was to make myself a functioning human again was by convincing myself of the possibility that science could lead to major life extension and I should worry about something that might be able to be changed

I have social anxiety so bad I can not talk to new people and very select number of people am I able to initiate conversations with. I’m constantly scared of saying something that will upset my friends or make them hate me, afraid I’m annoying or I complain to much and I cannot fathom how people want to be around me

I’m scared of failing or getting things wrong so much that it severely hinders my ability to do university work. Scared people will be disappointed in me, that I will lose my chance to be successful, that I will ruin my life because I fail

I don’t know what to do. There’s no happiness, no sadness, not even anger inside of me, it’s just fear. I’m a scared little boy trapped in reality. I just want to escape. I just can’t take it. I can’t handle reality

I dont know what to really do anymore. Part of me wants to just end it and be done with everything, but im not strong enough to do it. So in contrast with part one I was talking to my cousin a bit ago and we were joking about me calling her parents and telling them stuff about her and she revealed that her side of the family doesnt like me even a little bit. It kinda hurts since my side of the family at least pretends to. Im such a fucking loser it hurts. I decided that my loneliness needed to stop so I asked a girl in one my classes for her Instagram and we've been talking for a bit, but my ex and former friend (part 1 explains) just destroyed my confidence and I find myself texting this girl ""sorry for bothering you"" at the end of a sentence. Im so used to just being a bother and I feel like randomly apologizing for stuff like that just going to drive this person away and ill be completely alone again. Im glad to have someone around for once, but i cant help but know im going to fuck it all up. I was so into my depression one day and I ended up asking ""Do I bother you?"" Like what the fuck is wrong with me? No one wants questions like that from someone youve known for barely a month. She didnt respond and left it on read because its a stupid question I shouldnt even be asking  so I deleted it, but she moved past it and still talks to me, thankfully. I cut again recently for the first time in two years. I had lasted so long, but last week on Thursday I think, I just snapped. The moment I came home I went into my room and threw my backpack down and curled up on my bed with the cover of it still on, I just layed on top of everything. I had my face in my hands and I was telling myself how weird I am, how no one could possibly like me, how this new friend I made is just being nice and wants nothing to do with you. Eventually I got so bad that day I grabbed my switch blade and made three long cuts on my arm. Im just not okay on almost every front and I cant stop thinking about how being dead would benefit everyone I know. How I could just end it and no one will notice im gone. Also in contrast to part 1, im moving yet again so this new friend I made, even if she sticks around, it doesnt really matter cause she'll become a internet friend and I cant sit around in class and joke with them, eat lunch with them. i just cant do anything with anyone because all my parents do is make us move.

sometimes i even see her, her's fisical appearance is like this: her whole body is very shiny and white (the color white, not the race, she is paper-colored) with a long messy black hair, her face is just white, she dont have eyes or a mouth, its just a slender-men like face, you can see the places where it sould have the eyes and the mouth but they just dont exist, if i look her straight into the face it will start to get really weird and distorced, sometimes she walks, but she seems to never touch the groun, she always wears only a torn and dirty lilac dress and nothing else.

&amp;#x200B;

i dont think this things are related to the whole ""her"" thing, but im a teenager who is very confused with my sexuality, but im already working on this.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never been in a therapist so i dont know if i have depression, anxiety or something else so i really want advise and help, thanks reddit.

24,"I’m diagnosed GAD and have been on Effexor for years but I’m having a lot of breakthrough panic and anxiety. I feel breathless and scared constantly. Always tortured by somatic symptoms and fear of impending death. I have little friends, my mother is an addict, my dad can’t know I’m on meds or he’d FLIP (I am a grown adult but he’s very anti meds), my siblings all think I’m overdramatic. I called my old therapist’s office tonight and left a message. I really hope she still works there. I really need to vent and I just have everything all bottled up!",02Mar2019,6
25,"So like I have the most awkward horrible conversations due to anxiety. Some of my anxiety comes from lack of sleep and lack of social skills. 

I try really hard to be good but I make bad awkward mistakes talking to people or just being present. I actively try to avoid doing social things because I’m too anxious. It makes it even more awkward. 

I have become so lonely I’m not even sure how to act anymore. I can’t relate to anyone. My conversations sound lame and lack interesting content. 

Overall I’m starting to feel crazy. Life is starting to seem like too much and surreal. I hate it. I hate myself. I sometimes wonder if dying is worth it because it would be a big relief of stress and I wouldn’t embarrass myself anymore. 

I don’t know what to do. ",02Mar2019,6
26,"To start, I have been having some digestive issues, now to the point where this past week, I haven’t been able to keep anything down. I’ve missed almost a week of work, so I went to the doctor. I have a few appointments on Monday to get an ultra sound done and bloodwork to see if it is a physical issue that can be treated, but my doctor is convinced that it is stress. 

That’s all fine, but I cannot afford it. Even with insurance, it’s about $150 out of pocket PER SESSION. I looked into better help, and they offered me financial aid, which still made it $55 per week (I would be billed $221 per month). My budget is so tight that I only have $46 left over at the end of every month. I am at a complete standstill, because I’ve let stress and anxiety build up over the years to the point where it is affecting my job and my health, but I absolutely cannot afford the help I need.  

Oh, for some background: I’m a teacher in the US, have had a history of sexual abuse, family issues, financial woes, and a very stressful job (I come home with bruises from one of my behavior kids and is the key stressor at work).

Are there any other options? I’ve already tried to eliminate the things causing me stress, but everything else is out of my control, but I can’t help but stress for (ex., there isn’t anything I can do to stop stressing about my brother who is on the heart transplant list)",02Mar2019,5

28,"So recently things in my [20M] life have been very rocky - especially regarding my relationship with myself, and my relationship with my girlfriend [19F]. I’m going to try to be as honest as I possibly can because I really want to fix what’s going on both in my head and in my relationship with my girlfriend. I’ll start with myself

I was recently diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder and social anxiety. The more important thing is the PDD. It makes me turn every single neutral stimulus automatically negative. I have been predisposed to turning things negatively. Now, paired with this, I also have some extremely bad habits. Excessive sugar intake, masturbation, procrastination, rumination - they’re all there and I want them to go away. I hate that they’re there, and every time I feel bad about them I just go do them to feel better about them even for a little bit. It’s a vicious cycle. 

I have been feeling increasingly disconnected from people because I am not a very good conversationalist because I reside in my headspace of negativity and self consciousness very often. It’s this constant turning and analysis that my brain is always doing while people are talking that makes me feel very cluttered in conversation. However, (and I hope this doesn’t come across as arrogant, I just want to give credit where credit is due) I think when I am not in my head, and I am just “me” - hopping around, being myself - I’m a really fun and interesting person to talk to! When there isn’t a lot of pressure on a situation or a situation is familiar or accepting, I can just kind of not be so over-analytical for awhile. It feels like me! I will give examples:

Overly analytical: someone asks me what is going on and I awkwardly say, “I’ve been stressed!” but in my head I’m thinking “why did I say that, I’m not even that stressed besides in my head, I wish my thoughts would just stop, you probably just said you were stressed because you realize that most students are stressed and want to be relatable, wtf, why can’t you just relax around this unfamiliar person and be yourself”

Non analytical: sitting down with a friend and talking about how weird it is that francium costs one billion dollars for a gram, because that is crazy! watching Steve Irwin with my girlfriend and making horrible Australian accents together and just spending time together

So yeah, there’s just some examples of ‘types’ of ways I feel - there’s the “at ease” and then there’s the “paranoid, ruminative, overthinking” ... which is clearly a hinderance to my quality of life! It’s like trying to have fun in your life but you have a conversation always playing in your head that is completely delusional and distorting your sense of reality and enjoyment!

The worst part about all of this though, is how it has been manifesting in my relationship with my girlfriend. We’ve been dating for a little over a year, and she is my favorite person. She’s fun to be around, and she herself is a silly person and I value our banter. There are times when we are just laying together and look at each other and it feels like bliss. 

Our relationship has been strained recently I would say mostly on account of my issues and struggles. There are basically two main reasons why:

1. Sometimes I feel as if we are disconnected/not on the same page about things - but I think this is because I am so negative. She will just want to have a good time and laugh, and I will misinterpret all of her signals as meaning other things. For example, if I ask her serious questions she says that she doesn’t know a lot and tries to move on to get back to having fun and being happy between us - so that feels like a disconnect. The problem is, a lot of the time, when I am asking “serious” questions, it is just my brain being negative and ruminative, and it doesn’t feel like the “at ease” me. I’ll wonder “why does she even love you, there’s no way she still feels connected to you, you are so weird and undesirable for being the way that you are, you are disgusting for eating so much junk food and participating in addictive instantly gratifying activities” - and then I’ll see if she feels the same way. Of course, she doesn’t. She is an angel, and she loves me very much and I know that is true at the end of the day. I don’t know why I can’t stop these negative cycles of thought though and just be “at ease” and just stop the thinking. It really drives a wedge in between us because most of the time when I am being me things feel natural, I’m not overthinking anything and it just - works. It works really well and I love her to bits.

2. The other problem, and the part where I feel very dirty is that I feel like I’m becoming a “nice guy” because I want to have sex more than she wants to. At the beginning of our relationship we had a long talk about how the best relationships have 3 things - eroticism, romance, and friendship. At the time, I had said that in order of importance they were

1 romance
2 eroticism
3 friendship

While she had said that it was:

1 friendship
2 romance
3 eroticism

However, now I feel that friendship is also number one. There’s nothing better than having a partnership where you both have each other’s backs. At the time I didn’t have many friends and had been “burnt” a lot, so I didn’t really know what friendship was - but I think she has taught me in a lot of ways.

Anyway, we used to have sex a lot, which to both of us is something very sacred and important (I’ve never been one for hookups because I found it hard for them to have any emotional meaning behind them). We both genuinely enjoy having sex with each other, but she says that it is hard for her to do on my bad days when I am feeling doom and gloom - which is understandable and I respect that. I think we connect in different ways where I am more physical and she is more feeling/“vibe-y”. Both are important to both of us though! 

I guess my dilemma here is that I really miss the emotional connection with my #1 girl, but also feel like shit because I know sometimes she feels like I am just using her for her body - which DISGUSTS me. I don’t ever want to be like that and I just want her to feel safe and at “home”. Then this makes me have really bad thoughts too because again, excessive rumination about sex, and I have intrusive sexual thoughts that I HATE, about attractive people and also about masturbation and I think a lot about sex with my girlfriend. I feel like an asshole for this part but I don’t know what to do

That is all of it and I am looking for general advice because I feel like “I” am buried under rubble, and this weird, negative, demon (not literally) has overtaken my life.

A few more bits of background info
- I was also determined to be at risk for schizophrenia (but do not currently have it)
- I am seeing a therapist that I really enjoy!
- I have scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist at the end of the month!
- I used to be fairly overweight, and do have problems with body image (200lbs —&gt; 150lbs, now 160lbs)
- I have been cheated on once
- I have been sober for about 3 years, I used to smoke weed in high school

TL;DR - having a hard time with my life at the moment because of mental health issues, trying to find the right path to inner peace. Thank you to everyone who reads through this! If you need anymore information I will be glad to update!

31,"I’ve struggled with severe anxiety for 9+ years. I visited my GP 5 months ago and was prescribed 10mg of Lexapro a day. 

I’ve been on the med for the past few months. It has boosted my mood and allowed me to relax (as opposed to feeling tense all the time). Because of that I’ve had more energy, and have been able to go to the gym regularly, cook healthy meals, practice self-care, and build healthier friendships. My quality of life has improved so much. I’m genuinely happy and could cry with joy over how far I’ve come from being afraid of almost everything, and feeling anxious 24/7.

I work in the mental health field and honestly feel embarrassed that I didn’t visit my GP sooner. Because my anxiety wasn’t as extreme as the clients I work with (who are adolescents with adverse childhood experiences) I didn’t think I needed treatment beyond the odd therapy appointment. I was very wrong.

I know this thread is mostly people seeking advice and support, but I wanted to add some celebration into the mix.

I’m taking a semester off from college, and I’m living at home, which is an hour away from where I go to college and where my therapist’s office is. The drive there gives me too much time to overthink things, and it’s a little inconvenient to drive all that way for just an hour, although I don’t want to find a whole new therapist who’s closer only to find yet another when I go back to school.

39,"I have been struggling with depression for about a year and a half, and I've learned to cope with my condition without taking any meds. However, today was a pretty stressful day in school where I had a serious discussion with my gf, and then a teacher got very mad at our group and I felt personally attacked. At first I was just angry, but my emotions later fueled an all out panic attack. It was messed up, I felt that my body was being crushed and suffocated, plus I was trembling uncontrollably. I had a chat with my teacher which helped me calm down a bit, but I was still quite nervous about what I had just gone through. I was able to end the school day with the support of my best friend and gf, however.

Later in at home I thought I was calmed down and was watching Netflix, but when I finished watching I felt my insecurities creeping back on me as they usually do when I have an extended period of time to think. Instead of feeling sad as is custom, I began feeling nervous and could feel another panic attack coming. Thankfully my gf texted me at that moment and after talking for a while was able to calm me down again.

I think that my brain has caught on to a new to express my insecurities and since I have no experience dealing with things like this, I'd like a bit of advice on how to cope with future panic attacks (aside from the usual take deep breaths and visiting my therapist, which I already plan on doing). This is very important to me since I don't want to solely rely on others to help me calm down whenever I have these.

Tl;dr Had my first panic attack, experienced in coping with depression but not this, what can I do besides calling my therapist?

Thanks for any advice!",02Mar2019,1
40,"Originally posted on r/advice thought might be relevant here. 

I need advice. 

What do I say? He's one of my best friends. Has diagnosed aspergers, depression and anxiety. Multiple times he's talked about wanting to die / killing himself. A few years ago, whilst I was at uni, he tried to kill himself with a rope in a tree. The only thing that stopped him was knowing that I was making a special effort to travel and see him for his birthday. 

We were out tonight, managed to convince him to come back to mine to chat and have some whisky. (an achievement, he was initially insistant that he would just wonder south London ""thinking"". (Previously this has landed him in hospital or police custody for drunk and disorderly) 

Currently he's asleep but we were just talking about things that he is dealing with. He doesn't see the point of living any more.

Has not seen his gp or taken medication for anything for about 6 months.

Used to have really good care at a well renowned centre (UK) but couldn't afford (was paid for by family insurance, stopped due to chronic diagnosis or similar, I'm not sure of the particulars)

Would me contacting samaritans (UK suicide charity) or similar be helpful for him?

I understand that his thoughts are not ""normal"" and cannot be reasoned with or solved by me. I don't know what the next step to take is, if he's already refusing treatment and won't accept that he has people that love him and want to help him get better.

44,"Honestly, I'm here to rant so no one needs to comment. 

Sometimes I feel like I fall into this dark place that takes this huge hold on me and it's always so hard for me to fight out of it. Sometimes it will happen maybe once a day, once a week, once a month, you catch my drift. There is no set timeline. Just like how long it lasts. Sometimes it's only the day, sometimes it's weeks or even months. And right now I feel it starting. I'm 20 years old and married to the most amazing person ever. Sometimes I really think he doesn't understand or honestly just don't want to deal with it (me). There's been times where he stated he didn't feel like dealing with me or that it is exhausting. He does not know that when he said that which was so long ago it has stuck with me. I feel like I have to shoulder my burdens alone because I dont want him to feel like he has his plate full. I'm so dependent and I really need him sometimes. I tend to do this. I hold onto things and take the meaning too seriously or I make it into somethibg it's not. It's because I overthink so much and I seriously hate myself for it. I cannot stand putting myself through this. He leaves for a game every weekend and sometimes, like tonight, the second he leaves I burst into tears. I hate him leaving me. I'm not doing to ask him to stop going because he loves it so much and I love him.

I wanted to have a date tonight and we finally did after a week of me asking. He unintentionally does this thing where he orders for me. It's like he wants to ask me or persuade me when the waitress comes. He's not controlling, he does it in the way of trying to save money or to have a little bit of everything and we share. But sometimes it really bothers me when he does that because I'll ask him what he wants to do BEFORE the waiter comes out but he is either goofing off or doing whatever and I don't get an answer. He doesn't not mean to do it in the way that it is sounding. He does it purely out of love because again he wants us to have a variety because we both like that. Today when we finally had our date when he did it it just really upset me. I had this idea that I was going to use my bonus money on him. He would choose the app, entre, I would order my usual, and then we would get dessert. The whole point of the date was for him not to worry about prices or worrying about me and he didn't give me the chance to do that. I thought he would really like that.

Anyways. I just feel like I'm empty right now. I think that I'll be fine tomorrow when I wake up hopefully. I don't think I'll be feeling like this too long. 

Anyone who ever feels this way I am so sorry. Sometimes I cannot bare the pain I feel. I feel like I can't breathe. I feel like I can't move or think. I don't wish this upon anybody. This is the times I really wish I could have him next to me. He makes me feel better just by being by my side.",02Mar2019,2

55,"I just realized it's been... shit, it must be at least 2 weeks since ive last showered.

My mental illness is the wildest thing- besides adhd, anxiety, and depression, I have this slow fog in my brain that grows every day, making me less and less interested in... living, I guess. I dropped out of school cuz I just couldn't do the work, lost my job almost immediately, and drifted away from all my friends. Not because I didn't want to do the work or hang out with them, but becuase of this fuckin... THING that's sucking away my will to move.

I noticed the problem a long time ago, too. Despite that, however, none of my 3 therapists (each of which I saw until they basically pushed me out the door) knew what it was, simply giving me meds for the stuff they COULD identify... and hoping that would inadvertently fix the problem. Sadly that just postponed it, and here I sit, 3 years later, completely immune to the meds and utterly useless and a person.

Like??? It's fucking unfair. I wish this was something I could will myself through. I owe people money because of the shit I promised I'd do, I've hurt really good people because I just... never responded, and I'm ruining my life as the time ticks on. Better yet, I know for a fact its gonna get worse. Nothing ive tried works and I'm running out of time to find something that does, yet I CANT!!! Like literally I cant do things anymore how am I supposed to fix that!!!

One thing I really don't understand is... I was actually cured for a while. I drew every day, did favors for all my friends, grew my social circle, got a job!!! And became a leader for a multitude of internet projects. I was reliable for the first time in a long time. It was the best time in my life. But.... it faded. It lasted a half a year at most, during which I accomplished so much! But before I realized it, the fog was back, and all those responsibilities... Oof. I wasn't reliable anymore.

58,"I'll try to explain this in the most clear way possible. I am currently a college student. Back in high school, everything seemed to make sense for the most part. I could picture a future, and I was relatively optimistic. Ever since high school, things have changed drastically for me. Due to some rough situations with relationships, and losing friends, I've been struggling with depression and social anxiety that I had never dealt with before. I am currently in my last year of college, and I feel completely lost. I feel like my life is but a shell of what it used to be, and that scares me. I can't picture what's coming in the future, and that scares the hell out of me. I feel like I'm just going through the motions over and over and over now, and life has lost a lot of the meaning it once had. Getting out of bed is far harder now than ever, and I'm just sick and tired of this dark, negative life I've been living the last few years. I'm ready for a positive change.

I understand there is a level of complexity to this situation, but I'm asking what some generally good advice is to regain some footing and meaning in my life.

The past few weeks have been bad. I started cutting (this isn't the main thing the post is about, I'd prefer you comment about the main point) and have felt generally awful. My procrastination and distraction has reached a peak. I'm pretty much completely unable to do homework in 99% of scenarios. This leads to me staying up until 3-5, then doing some of my homework in the morning, and not finishing some of it. I don't know how to deal with the effect this has in me. I feel as if I've let my teachers down.

This Monday and Tuesday, I had moments in school when I felt incredibly trapped in and by myself because of this reaction. It felt like the only thing I was capable of doing was harming myself. On Monday at this point, I hit myself in the head with my fist. I'd done that a few times in the preceding weeks. I'm sure I could've hit harder, but it hurt and left me feeling bad about myself for the rest of the day. Some classmates were around. A couple gave me some attention for it. I wouldn't be surprised if that's part of the reason I did it, but I think most of it was the trapped and out-of-control feeling.

Sometimes I wish I had this feeling of being trapped more often, at home, so that I could cut more effectively. (I know the following is an awful and unproductive way to talk regarding cutting, but I genuinely can think of no other sufficiently effective way of conveying the feeling): I always pussy out.

Almost  one year ago, at 13 or 14 March I did something bad and stupid. I woke  up, my father was in kitchen. He was in bad mood. When I came to kitchen  to eat he told me that he had one amount of money, and now he has less  money. He told me that I stole it. I tried to explain that I didn't  steal it, but he continued to humiliate me. I went to my room, I felt  like trash, sad and angry in same time. Later I went to kitchen. Both of  my parents were there. I told my mother what he told me. She didn't do  anything. I was thinking that she will tell him that he can't humiliate  people so much.

Then  I did something stupid. I was sick of humiliation and I wanted to stop  it. I took his arms and I wanted to put him outside for 30 minutes, or  one hour, just to he feel how I felt. My mother didn't know what I want  to do, she was thinking that I want to beat him. He fell on floor. I put  my hand around his neck just to scare him. he yelled: this thief wants  to kill me. I got so angry that I spat on him and kicked him.

I wouldn't do something like this in normal state of mind. but I was to angry and sad in same time.

I  did it also because he was humiliating me when I was kid. he was  beating me, my mother and my sister, when I was kid, and he was beating  my mother before I was born, but I didn't do that because he was beating  us. I did it because he was humiliating me. And other people were  bullying me. Anger was bottled up. This day I couldn't take anymore.

Now I regret every day, that I reacted when he humiliated me.

I feel suicidal every day. I want to buy gun and shot my self. I hate my self.

One of my therapists from a few years ago actually wanted to get me tested for anxiety (not because of this, because of things regarding school) but my mom never took me to the appointment. Also, my mom doesn’t know about anything I’m about to mention in this post, I’m not supposed to have social media but I do anyways since she doesn’t check my phone at all, but I’d definitely get my phone taken away if I told her this.)

I don’t really know how to start explaining this, honestly. I’ve accidentally stumbled across some really horrible things on Tumblr and Instagram in the past few years, and they’ve sort of ‘stuck with me’ for a really long time honestly. I don’t want to give like specific details because they’re obviously very graphic but I’ve seen videos of people getting murdered, I’ve seen pictures of dead bodies and videos of animal abuse. 

I don’t really know how to explain how this stuff makes me feel, mostly because I’ve literally never talked to anyone about this. Like I can go about a month or two without thinking about any of these that much, like my mind will sorta like ‘drift’ to those things, but for some reason I don’t dwell on them (no idea why it’s only sometimes, honestly) but then like other times like... I can’t really ‘move on’ from those thoughts? And then I keep imagining the videos and pictures all over again even though I don’t want to? Like I try so hard to steer my mind away from those things when I get like that, but I can’t. And then my next week or two is just ruined, like I can’t concentrate in school because I just keep thinking about it, I have a hard time sleeping because I’m either laying in bed crying or too afraid to turn off the light (sometimes I have nightmares when/if I sleep), I can’t eat without feeling nauseous and I’m literally too afraid to go outside because I’m afraid of being murdered.

Read all of this and don’t dismiss it as a wall of text or guilt tripping:

I like how you purposely ignored all of the times I made you laugh and all of the personal talks we had together and just decided to focus on that one time I was going through a extremely dark time in my life and I acted out as if that’s entirely who I am. Don’t you dare call this guilt tripping or walls of text because that just proves that you’re deflecting the question so you feel less bad about it. I was always there for any of you during any of your problems and I listened every time but during my time of need you either ignored me or told me to fuck off. I didn’t know X’s mother was back in the hospital before I messaged him, it took me hours to work up the courage to speak to him because he told me he was my confidant and I could tell him everything but then he just sent you to do his dirty work. The callous way you kicked me to the curb and how you dismissed all of my problems when I would’ve never judged you for yours just proves how much of a disloyal asshole you are. The way you threw me out like a sub human piece of garbage wrecked me as a human being, I was beginning to enter rages just at the thought of you. You might think I’m pathetic but honestly, I pity you because you decided to verbally destroy a mentally ill person because I messaged someone who explicitly told me I could talk to him about my problems many times. I can promise you on my grandfather’s grave that this is not me trying to guilt trip you but rather a simple fact: the dread and anguish I felt from being abandoned caused me to overdose on paracetamol and now I’m facing permanent liver damage. I’ve destroyed my mind and body due to how badly you hurt me. I’ve seen several specialists and they just all spouted out the same drivel, so no help there.

But let me guess, you’re going to laugh with your friends about this on discord and make me into a laughing stock on the group because you don’t care about this. You don’t care about all the good times we had together because you’re looking for someone to take your anger out on so you feel better about yourself.

(it's pretty long, but I wrote about some important things regarding aspergers and asd that I think most people don't know).  


 

Asperger's Syndrome

Aspergers syndrome is a subtype of ASD (autism spectrum disorder). It affects the ability to understand directions given by others and often people affected may need someone to explicitly explain what is expected of them. Other things you might notice in people with Aspergers are obsessive or repetitive routines and physical clumsiness. People with Aspergers may feel anxiety in certain situations and repetitive routines may relieve some of that anxiety. It may feel “instinctive” to repeat the same routines or stick to the same things so that they do not have to step outside of their comfort zone. This behavior may come off as “obsessive” when in reality they are just doing what feels right to them. 

Other disorders that might coincide with Aspergers are depression or anxiety. This could be for a number of reasons: The anxiety may arise from the fact they have grown up with Aspergers and felt different, leading to anxiety and a feeling of inadequacy; the depression could come from the fact that having Aspergers (or other mental disorders) have made them feel that they are not good enough and that others dislike them, making them feel alone. Other reasons for depression or anxiety affecting people with Aspergers could be because of behavioral interventions and medications that could have other mental health side effects.

If it is not diagnosed early parents, teachers and other guardians may think the child is just being rebellious or badly behaved. This can badly affect the child’s mental health as the child is not at fault (nor are the guardians) they are just misunderstood. This could lead to a feeling of loneliness and put them into a depressive state that will continue throughout their teenage years and possibly into adulthood. It could also cause the child to harm themselves and give them a feeling of worthlessness.

Aspergers should not be seen as a disease that needs to be treated or cured but as a difference or even a personality type that should be celebrated. It is a common misconception that Aspergers or Autism stops people affected from being able to make friends, be social or creative. Many people affected by Aspergers and Autism can be very creative. Even if not all are. The condition may create difficulties in being creative, but not all people affected by the condition have creative difficulties. And although it creates difficulty in interacting with others and being friendly it doesn’t mean they are incapable. It just means it’s harder. Trouble maintaining eye contact or reading social cues affects them but it doesn’t prohibit friendship. People affected can be outgoing, kind and friendly, they just need to work harder than others on things other people usually have no problem with. 

People need to be more accepting of Aspergers, not by looking at them as people who have problems but by looking at them as being who have differences. Everyone is different in their own way even if they don’t have a condition. If they weren't the world would be a boring place.

In 2013, Aspergers was removed from the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders and people with these symptoms are now included within the Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Asperger's syndrome and autism have are different, although similar. People with Aspergers are now diagnosed with mild Autistic Spectrum Disorder and are given the same help as those with autism. In my personal opinion I think Aspergers should have been kept as a separate condition to autism as they are not the same thing. People with Aspergers might not relate to many symptoms of autism as they are different and need different support. 

The exact cause of Aspergers is unknown. Genetics and environmental factors are believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. Aspergers is greatly misunderstood by many people, even some psychologists as people studying the mental disorder can only know so much having not experienced it themselves. ",02Mar2019,1

I've never had any romantic relationships, and I have issues maintaining friends.. and trusting men. When I was sharing this, she asked:

&amp;#x200B;

""How was your father? (I look confused) From what you said he seemed caring""

""Yeah, he was fun and cared about me.. but I never knew if he'd be the kind dad or angry dad, hitting and punishing me""

""I see, but he was caring to you and your mother, he never hit her. And they didn't divorce""

""Yes.. but-""

""Why do you fear men, then? It doesn't make sense""

""... because the rest of men I was in contact with were rude and abusive to their partners. Because I was bullied by boys and people excused it saying 'they like you, that's why they hit you'""

""I see, but they weren't your father""

""What does that have to do with it?""

""We develop unhealthy relationships based on our parents, your uncles and classmates don't affect your mind or childhood""

&amp;#x200B;

When I tried telling her this was making me feel unwell, she explained this is what ""psychology has scientifically proven is true, we are only shaped by own parents, so it makes no sense I'd feel traumatized in other ways"". I actually forgot this scene until today, so it's upsetting me a bit much.. I've had a couple bad months with my mental health, so it sucks

85,"So... here goes I guess. I really don’t know if I even should be writing this at all, honestly. I figure that online posts are the best way to stay anonymous, but you know the old saying that no one is ever truly safe on the internet. Well anyway. I guess I should just get to the point here.  So to begin I have to add that I have a strong tendency- like obsessively to cling on to people. The reason I do it, I’m not proud of it, but I think it’s because I’m terrified of being alone. This causes me to cling on to people that I then realize I don’t even know that well. It’s not just people I love either. To explain further I think I’ll have to give some examples. The first person I thought I loved him. (Not going to use names for their privacy and my own.) I went to extremely desperate measures to get us to be together. This includes trying to memorize his schedule, trying to hack his computer (wich I can say I’m actually very greatfull I never did.) trying to find out where he lived, and even (here’s the part I’m especially not proud of.) threatening other people he talked to for fear that he would “fall in love with them.” Or vice versa. Eventually it got so bad that I had to go to the hospital for it. Anyway though this is all an old situation, so here’s why I’m mentioning it. I’ve noticed that even after all this time I’m still doing it with other people. Not just people I “love” either. It can be people I hate, too. For example I want to “become” this person I had then idolized.  I wanted all the so called power she had. I won’t go into too much detail but because of this whole incident I had a near suicide attempt. (Please note I’m absolutely NOT suicidal now.) the people I’m obsessing over now, one I’ve lost contact with and the other I nearly got a restraining order with. The main part is that this all seriously effects how I think and feel. I’m constantly worried that I’ll hurt someone. There’s this sort of “voice” that talks to me and tells me to do hurt others and sometimes harm myself. This voice isn’t something I actually here, it’s more like she’s talking to me in the form of a thought. It’s like I’m hearing someone else’s thoughts but directed towards me. Like I can hear it, but I know it’s only In my head if that makes any sense. It’s very distressing and no matter how I explain it I don’t think anyone quite understands. I know this sounds more like a bad creepypasta or nosleep story, but I seriously assure you that this is absolutely 100% real. When I get obsessive it also heavily takes a tole on my emotions. When I’m near it by the person of interest I get this amazing feeling. It’s like I’m immortal (yes I know I’m really not.) but it’s hard to describe any other way. It’s the best feeling in the entire world, like I can do anything and everything right then... in till later when they leave and I feel like I’m dead inside. Like I’m extremely depressed sometimes I want to hurt myself, then. I have been diagnosed with OCD among other things, but I worry sometimes that since I both want to hurt people, and then absolutely hate the thought that their may be something else going on as well. I feel so confused. If I say the truth I may go back to the hospital, but if I lie I fear that the thoughts and everything may get worse. Sorry for the long rant. Is this a clear example of OCD or am I actually loosing my mind here? ",02Mar2019,1
86,"Using a throwaway because I don't want to be known on my main account as ""that joyless fuck who doesn't want a cat.""

Okay, so a couple years ago, my mom's cat died. I had bonded with this cat while I was living at her house for about six months, and his death was really traumatic for me. Since then I have gotten my own place, and I've been waffling on getting a pet for myself. I've pretty much come to the conclusion that nice as it would be to have a cat around, I am not a suitable environment for a cat due to my emotional dysregulation and executive dysfunction. I would either hit the cat and end up killing it, or leave something on the floor that they cat would eat that would end up killing it. There are no possible good outcomes for either me or the cat. It's a nonstarter.

My therapist does not agree. Since I expressed this to her she's been on the warpath about getting me a cat. She's wasted untold amounts of time that should have been spent focusing on me and my problems, trying to convince me what a great cat owner I would be. She's suggested fostering a cat ""just to see,"" like it would make me feel better to kill a cat I was supposed to give back instead of one I was supposed to home permanently. Last session she actually made me list all the good things that cats do. I don't really care how great they are as pets. I. Don't. Want. One. That should be good enough for her. But apparently, I'm just not smart enough to make those decisions for myself. I'm half-convinced that I'll show up to therapy one day and she'll have one already waiting for me, about to be euthanized if I don't adopt it immediately and become the cat-loving client she's always wanted.

I've asked her why she's so abnormally obsessed with this, and she gives me some incoherent bullshit like ""I just think a cat would be so happy with you."" That's not true, obviously, but even if it were, the choice should be mine. Am I within my rights to terminate contact with this idiot?",02Mar2019,1

In the last couple of months I’ve been working on a project about mental health, as it is a very important subject often ignored in my city (Cabo San Lucas, in Mexico).

I have always been passionate about mental health and everything surrounding the “mind” part of the brain, and as a promising school fair is announced I decided to partner up with my artsy classmate to build up this project called Mokuini.
It is mainly targeted to children, and as we are both very passionate about writing it aims to teach about the importance of mental health from an early age using short stories with animate, upbeat and colourful characters.

Now, I’m a very big thriller fan, and often when I try to write I come up with rather gloomy ideas.

94,"PROS OF STAYING WITH MY THERAPIST:

* I do what you're supposed to do when you are mentally ill/depressed (IDK WHAT I HAVE YET)

CONS OF STAYING WITH MY THERAPIST:

* With the excuse of therapy being progress I mindlessly go there to be told advice I already know and lies. For example: I say I resent my friends and that I want to avoid talking to them again, she goes ""if you do that then you will not have friends"". WELL DON'T YOU THINK I ALREADY KNOW THAT? CAN WE PLEASE DIG INTO WHY I FEEL THE NEED TO SHUT OUT MY FRIENDS.
* I don't feel comfortable opening up to her (and nether was I with the previous therapist). I feel like I'm not understood, like everything I say it's going to be met with a ""whoops that's yet one behavior more you need to correct"" so I just shut up.
* If she asks me to say good things about myself and I can't I feel so bad. Like sorry I'm broken I came here to solve this. Then she says that there's things, I just don't realize. No, my life is a disaster and I'm bad at most things THAT'S WHY I'M DEPRESSED. I'M NOT LYING.
* She refuses to diagnose me, which I desperately want because up until now I've done nothing but show bpd and adhd  signs and she's not treating them accordingly because she doesn't want to diagnose me.
* I don't feel better after going there. I feel like I have more work and chores to do. I do what she tells and it doesn't work because it's idealized advice based on the ideal basis that there's nothing neurodivergent with me, which there is. For example, she gives me advice to get closer to my college friends, I do what she tells me but there's still this off thing about me that these friends catch on.

95,"I got put on a waitlist for an eating disorder specialist back in October and recently had a consultation with their psychiatrist. Essentially she informed me that my only option for treatment was to ""first gain weight"" - which I realize is understandable on its own, but her explanation was that because I'm underweight, my brain isn't functioning properly and THAT's what's giving me thoughts of wanting to be underweight, ergo once I gain I'll be well on my way to being cured. Is it just me or is this kind of obviously ridiculous? Or at least unorthodox?  


She seemed kind of forlorn with pity or something when I declined being put into their day program (mind, I'm high functioning and a full time student), though I'm taking her recommendation of trying to see a dietitian since, you know, I would like to do something about it. Just frustrated since I've been getting some long-untreated mental health issues sorted out for a while now and this issue has been kind of irritating in general - i.e. my previous shrink telling me week after week that he can't treat depression while I'm 'starving myself' even when I was going through binge phases and, surprise, super depressed about it.

96,"TL;DR at the bottom &lt;3

ALSO **\*\*MILD TRIGGER WARNING\*\*** I'm actually not entirely sure, but just in case, paragraph 4(yikes, this was supposed to be a quick question, not a novel), just before the bullet points is a quick note about suicidal ideation. 

My partner went psychotic back in October, and I was fully in charge, and after a few months of care, he's finally back at work as of this week and following treatment for BP. 

I'm a bit worried about myself because I just started treatment for OCD, and I've had a couple of low points. My psychiatrist said I should stop Paxil(only 13 days), but since I'm traveling for work, we decided it's safer if I take a smaller dose until we meet next week.

Because what I was feeling was rather odd(crying, fear of being anxious again when I stop the medication, feeling selfish and greedy for eating meat multiple times a week, wanting to smash my phone when I'm frustrated, headaches), and also because I will probably be put on a different treatment when I see him, and thus go through other rounds of symptoms, I realized I'm not prepared in case of a mental health emergency, and that it might be a good idea to leave instructions for my partner, as well as my sister and how to inform my parents who live outside of the US.

When I woke up this morning, I felt it was silly to want to make that plan, until my heart started racing again, and my eyes were puffy and I felt a headache coming in. I don't think I'm going to die, but I can imagine the quirky ideas I'm having where I, the meat lover, start feeling bad about eating cows and fish, start feeling selfish for eating meat, or when I have graphic ideas on how taking my life if things happen to my mom. I won't act on the suicidal bit, I know it's my OCD being a dick. 

Essentially, I just want:

* My partner to know where to find the note(he's still forgetful),
* My partner to follow steps on how to inform my sister so she doesn't worry and drive crazy(hevenucamembert is fine, she had a mental health crisis and asked me to share this with you. She's a planner and left instructions for you as well). And also fill out an FMLA and disability form ASAP. I don't want this to be my life, but at the same time, when my partner was hospitalized, I had know idea what the eff an FMLA was, or how to make sure he'll keep his job. Better safe than sorry.
* How my sister should inform my parents without affecting their health(they're older and sick), because I call my parents every day, and they'd know something is up.
* Make sure my parents' bills are paid on time if I end up staying longer than necessary
* Make sure my pup and kitty are fed

Have you prepared anything in writing in case you have a mental health emergency, with instructions on how to treat you, and how to inform your family, what bills to pay etc? If so, do you hide it, or leave a post it on where to find it? I don't feel comfortable leaving it on my computer, but then again, maybe I should email it to my partner

So, TL;DR, Scared of treatment in case of ER, and want my partner and my sister to follow my exact instructions if it ever were to happen, and would like your thoughts on how/where to leave instructions

107,"Hello! 
Background: I’m F15 and have been fighting with my mind over therapy for years. I don’t have a bad relationship with therapy or a stigma attached to it, but I doubt that I need it a lot. I’ve gone to therapy. Been to therapy once as a 7-8 year old because of severe emotional reaction to parents divorce. 

Ever since 2nd grade, I’ve struggled with my mental health, and it seemed to get worst 2 years ago.  2 years ago, I struggled with an emotionally abusive friendship, family issues, breakup, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. I’ve improved A LOT since then, but still don’t feel “mentally right.”  I usually push my emotions/thoughts away by saying it’s normal teenage behavior and everyone else feels like this. I’ll give you a list of things I struggle with.  I won’t go into details, but if you need me to I’ll be willing to explain.  I just need validation if I need therapy or if I’m experiencing normal teenage behaviors. 

1. I always seek validation or opinions from others before I do a decision.

2. Don’t have any hobbies and lay in bed a lot after school. 

3. I lose friends a lot because of behaviors I do or because petty drama. 

4. I manipulate people to get what I want or to make them upset even though I know the consequences. 

5. Constantly irritated everyday and anger outbursts are usually towards loved ones which includes me cussing them out, calling them names, blocking them, ignoring them, or making them feel bad. 

6. I overthink. A lot. Too much. 

7.  I have a hard time opening up to friends because I feel disgusted with myself after opening up.

8. I have desires for drugs when I get upset. Usually heroin or pills are stuff I yearn for even though I’ve never done them. Only have done weed. 

9. Rarely, I self harm. I relapsed a few weeks ago after being clean for almost 2 years. It wasn’t anything too serious. 

10. Sometimes I disassociate when upset or anxious like I’m almost in a dream like state and nothing is real. 

11. I push people away, but once they leave to give me space, I get upset at them for leaving me.

12. I always like to be right in an argument. If I’m not right, I get angry. 

13. My moods change from deeply sad to really happy to angry quickly everyday. 

14. I go from loving someone to hating them real quick if they do something “bad.” 

15. I feel empty a lot. 

16. My sleep schedule is really messed up. I stay up till 12-4am almost every night even on school days. 

17.  When highly upset or even feeling a little left out, I feel like no one cares about me, is gonna leave me, or hates me. 

18. I have a hard time with feelings of guilt. Some days it feels like it’s eating me from the inside. 

19. My relationship with my dad isn’t close and I blame it on my stepmom. 

20.  I do risky behaviors that seem to be normal for a teenager. I don’t constantly do them but I occasionally sneak out to boyfriends house, smoke weed, and rarely drink. 

21. For a few months I felt numb and now I feel like everything is affecting me. 

22. Some days I wish everyone could leave me because I don’t deserve them or I should be wiped off this earth. 

23. I feel like my life lacks meaning because I don’t have talents, hobbies, or some special thing about me. 

24. My grades are usually A’s so luckily I don’t struggle with school, but I do struggle with getting motivation to do work/study. 

25. I feel like I have to replace someone if they leave my life. 

26. I hate the person I am right now. 

27. I feel like I make too many mistakes.

28. I feel like no one understands me or thinks I’m a bad person by the things I’ve done. 

29. I use to be really helpful and love giving advice to people, but I hate it now.

30. I get stressed really easily. People describe me as “over-dramatic.”

I erased parts of it but honestly it makes me sick to even think of the fact it was there in the first place.

I'm stuck in between wondering if my environment is taking a toll on me, or rather I can improve myself within it and hopefully improve it? I don't know",02Mar2019,2

115,"So I’ve had what felt like a “trip” twice last year. The first one was I woke up early in the morning and I could “feel vibrations” it’s hard to explain but I would look at things and I could feel their vibrations, that’s the best I can explain it really. The second was the next day I woke at maybe the same time and I could see colors, the sun rays coming through the curtain were the colors of the rainbow and they were every where in the room and I was just looking around fascinated I think. I know I was hallucinating but what could have caused me to have these hallucinations I’ve looked online and all I found was people who’ve abused LSD who would wake up to things like these (I’ve never done drugs)(I do meditate maybe it has something to do with it but not sure). My guess is it’s something like bipolar because a couple days before I had gone through a scary phase of what I think is depression , something I’ve never felt before, it was extreme emptiness I could never shake, so my guess is at that point i was depleted of serotonin and when I had this episode it was the serotonin being introduced to my system (this is only a guess obviously).




I have other weird experiences when I wake up often but not all the time though, where I would feel like I’m tripping but there is no hallucinations, I’d have these “realizations” and time and everything feels weird.




Have you ever had a similar experience? Any advice? What do you think?anything would be great :)))))) (There is no hope to go see a psychiatrist or anything of that sort atm so it doesn’t matter if I think I have bipolar as I’m not really gonna do anything about it, and I’m very functioning )(also I’m gonna post this in a few subreddits so sorry if you see it more than once).",02Mar2019,1
116,"How can I change my mind set? I'm 23, never had a relationship because I feel like.. why would anyone love me? I am average in every way, I have nothing to give.

I always lied to myself about it, I'm kinda ashamed to admit it, because I'm the one always preaching that everyone deserves love and happiness. After doing some scary deep dive into my true feelings I sadly discovered I don't believe that at all when it comes to me. It's like a thing deeeep down that keeps going: you don't deserve to be loved. I wish I could change that",02Mar2019,17

I feel like garbage right now because of bad reaction to Trazadone, but I guess I could be doing better for jury duty by the end of the month. I'm just worried about missing my therapist appointment I feel like it's essential.

120,"I left public school two months ago and recently starting doing online school. It isn't working. I get so frustrated and stressed out. When getting to those points it brings a lot intense anger issues and suicidal thoughts. That's why I left public school. *Nothings working.* I don't know what to do. At PS, I had panic attacks everyday and was harassed for a bit as well as the anger issues and thoughts. All of it..it's too much. I really feel like I'm being pulled under water with no escape. It's not like I really care, since in 2 years max, I'll be dead. My parents keep getting mad with me because I'm not doing any schooling as of now. I haven't been officially withdrawn but I just-- can't.. I can't just suck it up and do it. It's so overwhelming.  All of it, it's so..bad. I've gotten real tired of living really.

121,"All the time I’m in moments of distress, anger or where there’s a great deal of emotion my voice in my head isn’t saying “I need to calm down or I fucking hate this” it more feels like I’m sitting at a table with other voices telling me what we could said and how I should act. I usually don’t ever give into them to be honest I don’t know if I’m making this up or if they’re real. But it feels like that or in my head it’s like I’m sitting across from someone telling me we have to indulge in these acts of self destruction and become the worst possible version of ourselves. I’ll never understand it sometimes I wanna get better other times I don’t I’m always contradicting myself also. I just need some advice or help I think. I’m on medication for mood swings and I should be going back to therapy soon and I’m already talking to my school counselor. ",02Mar2019,1
122,"A few months ago, I became homeless with 2 cats.  By mid December, I had a place of my own with my cats and my stuff.  While I do like my new place, part of me feels sad, like I'm missing something.  Could it be that I was so comfortable in my old hometown that now, it's taking me longer than expected to adjust?",02Mar2019,2
123,"So I've been dealing with poor mental health for as long as I can remember. I'm 24 now, been high strung with frequent panic attacks and near constant anxiety since the age of 13. Early on I thought it was just a symptom of being a teen and having raging hormones but now I'm 24 and I still suffer from a lot of the same problems. Arguably it has gotten worse since I started law school, as the high stress environment has exacerbated my anxiety. I frequently become overwhelmed with anxiety and suicidal thoughts, and about once every 4 to 8 weeks it'll all explode out as a panic attack.

My poor mental health is a burden on my loved ones, especially my boyfriend who I've been dating for almost three years now. I have this horrible belief that no one could ever truly know me and still love me, because anyone that knows me that well will think I'm garbage and more trouble than I'm worth and abandon me. That belief makes me bottle up my feelings instead of sharing them and also makes me say horrible things when I'm in the middle of a panic attack and am fully expecting whoever is there with me in that moment to just abandon me right then and there. My boyfriend especially, who witnesses me in this state most often, gets distressed when I hide from him and tell him that I know he hates me when I'm in the middle of a panic. I feel like even more of a piece of garbage when I see how much my bad mental health is a burden on him and other people I care about, and I feel so guilty about how tired and stressed my boyfriend gets having to deal with me in this state.

I've finally started seeing a psychiatrist a few weeks ago because I'm scared that my panic attacks are ruining my relationship with my boyfriend and hurting my relationships with other people. I hope something will help.",02Mar2019,1
124,"I‘m only 161cm (5‘3.5) which is reeeaaally short. I was always the shortest guy by a large margin. I did not have any issues during puberty, I guess we just have the genetics to be short. It has always bothered me a lot but in Highschool where I had a supportive community it wasn’t that big of an issue. Now I started college last year and things are not going very well especially when it comes to dating/women. The issue is pretty much that there is not even that many girls shorter than me. My height would be even short for a girl. I am not very masculine looking, I‘f say I have an attractive face but my height ruins everything. Maybe I could cope with 5‘6 or 5‘5 but damn. 5‘3? And im done growing at 22 too.


I am basically searching for emotional support. Dating of course is a big issue at my age. Should I continue to put effort in? Should I approach taller girls too even though the chance of success is tiny? Can anybody relate? I feel very lost

I am seeing a therapist as well because it‘s really unbearable for me to be this way but I feel like I could gain a lot from talking to other real people too",02Mar2019,4

I worry about anything and everything, even made up situations. I'm atleast 4 weeks behind on my work and I'm constantly worrying about it, but I dont have the motivation to do the work?

128,"Long story short: Prior to yesterday, I had been addicted to pornography for nearly two years. Whether on my own with masturbation and PornHub, or with my now-ex girlfriend and mutual masturbation over FaceTime, everything around me was fueling my addiction. Every day, I would watch pornography and masturbate, after which I would feel extremely unclean, yet there was no recourse for my despicable actions.

&amp;#x200B;

Granted, it's only been two days since I quit cold-turkey. But I feel extremely accomplished. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the month of January, I dealt with a terrible self-harm habit. I quit that permanently on February 1st, and haven't had a single urge since.

In the month of February, and for two years prior, I dealt with a terrible porn/masturbation habit. I quit that permanently on March 1st, and, though there's been discrete opportunities to give in since then, I've managed to stay clean and emerge unscathed.

130,"Hello, fellow redditors.

So, my teacher (I’m 15) told me that she thought I was manic depressive a couple days ago. I didn’t know what it meant and forgot about it till it came to my mind and decided to look it up a couple hours ago. I did a quiz and it showed severe signs of mania. When reading about it, I remembered my friends saying that I was both happy and sad at the same time, that they are unsure how to act around me because I was so irritable every now and then. Normally, I am incredibly energetic at school or whenever I’m with my friends. I can’t stop dancing, singing or talking to people and joke around. Though sometimes, I just like to be left to my own devices because I get pretty sad and feel worthless, suddenly thinking none of my best friends love me or other things. Another thing, something i really dislike anout myself, is that I find it really hard to stay serious and thoughtful if a friend of mine is feeling sad or blue. Don’t know if that has anything to do with these symptoms though. The thing is, I’ve never noticed anything weird about how I act before reading about manic depression. Do you thinl I should consult a psychiatrist? Thanks a lot for reading and your time.",02Mar2019,3

This has happened to me a lot over my life and when something tragic happens I will just laugh, I was watching the new modern family and when Claire's mum died I had to try and hold in laughter but I don't know what was funny about it. I don't want to be like this because it just makes me seem like a dick when I'm trying not to be. 

I feel no motivation or inspiration to do anything and just can't be bothered doing anything and will just procrastinate and sit on my phone all day and when I'm in school I will just zone out. My future seems hopeless and I barely feel emotions and I don't know if this is normal for your teenage years, I have been feeling this way for two years after being depressed for about a month. 

Can someone tell me what I should do cause I really don't fuckin know anymore.",02Mar2019,1
