I'm struggling at the moment, but I'm hoping it'll help in some way.

1,"I've been diagnosed with a number of mental illnesses since I was a child; ADHD, OCD, social anxiety disorder, borderline personality disorder, ptsd nightmares, etc. I wondered if anybody out there struggled with some of the same issues and would be open to talk about it?",09May2019,1
2,"I met with a new psychiatrist yesterday and he said that he believes I have a personality disorder, but wouldn't say which until our follow-up, when he would be sure (the reason being that he wants to see which symptoms persist when I'm not depressed). Our initial appointment was made to address my depression but derailed heavily into me explaining my troubles with surveillance paranoia and mild Cotard-esque delusions.

We ruled out borderline together since I'd previously received a misdiagnosis of borderline traits from a dismissive ER doctor. An old doctor once mentioned schizotypal traits but never wrote it down, although I do see myself in that. I believe this new doctor is probably referring to one of the disorders in Cluster A, although I am trying very hard not to jump to conclusions. Who knows, I could be a raging narcissist with zero insight. Unlikely, but possible.

Either way, the idea that these struggles are tied to my personality rather than something medicatable is troubling to me. I was hoping there'd be a pill-a-day fix to my issues, but it's not looking so simple now. How can I prepare myself to accept whichever outcome will be? I'm worried that having a personality disorder will make me a bad person, or that it will limit me in ways that being undiagnosed won't. Or worse yet, that the doctor will all-of-a-sudden decide that there is nothing wrong with me at all. That may be my worst fear.

How do I cope with this ahead of time, even without knowing the exact label? This is the first doctor I've seen who actually took what I was saying into consideration, and so it seems that I'm on the brink of the first correct diagnosis of my adult life (even if I'm not sure what exactly that is yet). If you live with one, how did you react and deal with the news of having a personality disorder? What kind of thinking was helpful, and what do you suggest I avoid doing?

Thank you for reading this, I know it was long. I just needed to get a lot off my chest and I'm feeling kind of lost.",09May2019,1
3,"I am the youngest out of six siblings. My three siblings above me, have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and one sibling (my sister) has schizophrenia. I am a male, just turned 27, and found out sadly on my birthday that my sister above me, was diagnosed with a severe form of bipolar disorder. I spoke to her about two months prior to the manic episode, which landed her in the psych ward, and she seemed very normal. I received a call on the phone, that she was seeing things (demons) and was very out of it, and was quite stubborn (not at all like her). 

I called the neurologist and asked a couple of questions; to which he said I am most likely genetically predisposed.  I am worried that I may develop symptoms for either of these, and am quite frankly nervous about what it could do to my life, if I develop illness.  Has anyone else dwelt with an issue like this in their family? How did you approach it? Did you eventually get diagnosed, after an older sibling developed it earlier?",09May2019,1
4,"I don't know what this is. Maybe I'm sad, but I feel like crying or breaking something. I want  *something* but I don't know what that is. I know it's in the middle of the night and maybe my behavior is unhealthy but I just can't help it! 

Everyone is sleeping, while I'm sitting in my room, listening to sad music. It's just me and my thoughts and I'm having this weird feeling. Me *being* here hurts? Idk, maybe it doesn't hurt and it's just this feeling of being suffocated from the inside. I don't know anymore. Maybe there's something that just wants out. I can't name it. It's like an empty thing inside of me that has no name, yet it exists while it really doesn't show its face very often. Like a faint itch in my soul.",09May2019,3

6,"Hey, so I have this thing going on where I want to be abused. Sexually, physically, and emotionally.

This is NOT because of a fetish or anything like that. I want it because I felt neglected and my family doesn't care about my mental problems. So I was thinking ""If I was abused, then my situation would be more serious."" I don't know how to handle this because I keep having sexual fantasies and I masturbate almost every day (to the point where I go on on my period). I get depressed when I realize I wasn't sexually abused. I try to exaggerate my symptoms for medications so I can abuse them. I tried to run away twice so I could take a break from therapy and my family. I don't give a shit if they call the cops it doesn't matter.

If **ANYONE** can describe what's wrong with me I'll be glad to hear you.",09May2019,1
7,"I’m constantly doubting myself. No matter how many times people tell me how great I am, at the end of the day I lay in bed and wonder if everyone secretly hates me. I’m starting to think that the reason I’m single is because I just suck. I know that these thoughts are false and I’m just paranoid, but I think I should open up to you guys. 

Also, as of late, my new anxiety seems to be about being gay. I know I’m attracted to girls, but apparently my personality fits one of a homesexual according to some. and sometimes I’ll find a guy has a nice face ( I’m not attracted to them, but I worry if that means I’m probably homo). I’m sorry if this sounds ridiculous, I just need to type this up somewhere.

Thanks guys",09May2019,1

9,"How i see it, i was driving in the ""self love"" highway, then for some reason instead of going to ""self love town"" i started to get far and far away from there. At some point there was an intersection, i took it and ended in a road where there's no lights, i can see a damm thing and while I'm obviously lost i don't feel entirely bad. This road is called ""i hate myself road"".

While I was having one of my common and multiple panic/violent attacks, i said it out loud, ""i hate myself"". I never said it before. Then suddenly, the crying stopped and somehow the pieces in my head aligned and it all made sense. I hate myself.

I know I'm sick, no amount of hate could put hallucinations or psychosis on my head. But for years even before that, i knew something was wrong with me. I have never been the brightest, the smart one, the hard worker one.. Ive always been the lazy, boring, needy one. I've always wished someone to love me deeply and unconditionally in the way i am obviously no capable of love myself.

I always look to harm me, i vomit, i don't eat, i take more pills than I should, i cut myself, i tend to look for destructive relationships and I'm always sabotaging myself.

Now that i realize that I completely hate myself... While I'm calm and kinda happy to know it.. I'm more lost than ever. Do i want to love myself? Do i want to keep hurting me? How could i reverse this?

Changing my habits like everyone says? To eat 1 meal more or sleep 8 hours, will make me love myself?

I know I've been trying, maybe not as well as I should. But every time i try and i fail. All I want is to give up. To kill myself, to just stop existing. Still... It feels good to know i.. Hate... You(myself)",09May2019,7
10,"It's hours before our exam, and as I was reading my notes, I came to realize and understand myself.

I was chronically bullied in High School for petty things like my hair, my teeth, and my mediocrity. It has been 6 years since I've escaped that hell period, and man I thought I just had to straighten myself up.

I've been doing (and constantly trying) my best to act strong all the time, just for it to be some sort of defense mechanism. My attitude towards people became stiff, and I hated a lot of them so I never really had so much friends in college. And I hated BOYS; I never entered a relationship with someone just probably it reminded me of the majority of those bullies were boys too. I just became this emotionless, frigid, angsty person, and I hated people.

At the present time, I was thinking of how I became this way. *Why aren't men trying to pursue me?* I'm not ugly. I've changed so much then, but *why, until now, am I still single?*

*Why am I not having long-lasting friendships? Do they think I'm too much private? Do I seem uninterested/uninteresting?* 

I've looked at the mirror, and what I saw was who I would never ever like. And I did feel it, how everyone hated me back.

I've experienced weeks (or months?) of emotional storm. Anxiety ticked and depression tocked. I felt worthless and irrelevant. Every night, I curled on my bed, trying to process what's wrong with me. *All I did was to be like everyone, right?* But I knew I wasn't. Even, none of all the things made me happy.

But I did know this: I've never shown who I really am (or was), and now I can't 'cause I've totally forgotten who I was before those hell years lol

I've had moments when I just wanted to kill myself, so every thing that gives me this heck of a feeling would be gone. Every night, I'd breakdown and would search with my eyes for something sharp. But I, in the present, am thanking that past self that I didn't have any inside my room.

Right now, I've thought about those things. I shouldn't have depended on what others would think of me. It only poisoned my idea of myself and how I should treat people. Honestly, my social skills are dying for not interacting and being intimate with people.

Also, I'm sick of being inside of this box. I want to be myself again, to be able to love, and nurture relationships. They say happiness is a choice. And I want to find happiness in things, even if it's gonna make me feel weak.

PS: I don't know if this is the perfect place to post. Hope it's fine.

TLDR: 4 yrs of bullying changed me into a frigid and angsty person. Been experiencing emotional storms. Now I want to be free from all those things and just be happy.",09May2019,1
11,"I was feeling fine about myself a couple of weeks ago. Well, as fine as a depressed 17 year old can be. 
I’ve had ups and downs but at the moment, I’ve relapsed back into my depression. 

I’ve lost motivation to do things I like. I’ve lost motivation to be a functioning person. 
My anxiety is boomeranging back so now I’m scared of everyone and everyone. 
I’m starting to self harm again. 
I’m getting bad thoughts. 
My insomnia is coming back. 
I’m getting suicidal ideation again. 

I just don’t know what to do. I can’t talk to anyone, my mother can’t accept her own mental health let alone mine. I’d rather not worry my grandma with such things and I’ve never told my psychologist/doctor everything (I’ve bounced around from psychologist to psychologist for a few years now and I never told them everything). 
There was a time where there was talk of sending my to a mental ward at the hospital but the doctors never did. I’m hesitating in voluntarily signing myself in (that’s a conversation I don’t want to have my my mum and grandma)


I’m going to try and push myself to do things I like (read, video games etc). But it’s difficult in this state. So I want to know, how do you handle relapses? Is their any tips/ideas you could give me to get myself out?",09May2019,1
12,"TL;DR: Mild anxiety led to suicidal ideation and self-harm, weed caused a psychotic break and the last diagnosis I received was bipolar. What if I'm anxious? 

Hi. 

""Mental health"" became part of my vocabulary when I turned 16 (I'm 21 now). Intrusive thoughts, an overall overactive, unquiet mind and a personal bully inside my head were all over me. It started to consume me, so I went running for answers. 

All of a sudden I'm in my first dosage of antidepressants. However, what started as a relatively mild anxiety quickly turned into suicidal ideation, self-harm and a chaotic behavior - lots of alcohol, weed, tobacco.

I often used the term ""depressed"" to refer to that period in my life. But I never felt lethargic. I never stood still. Thoughts were always racing, unstoppable. I stopped talking about these thoughts with my therapist and focused on suicidal ideation and self-harm, which seemed to be more urgent issues. However, this internal, extremely aggressive voice that didn't even seem to be truly mine, with its dialogue full of ""you're doing it wrong"" and such, seemed to be the main reason behind that whole snowball effect. And my, isn't it slippery, this internal bully.

Fast forward to when I'm 20, smoking a lot of weed, BAM, I had a psychotic break full of delusions that lasted for two months. Doctors gave a quick look at me at the psych ward (a really quick look at me, I'm talking about 15 minutes) and said: you're schizoaffective. 

Then I came back home, had no other psychotic episode, no delusions at all, and another psychiatrist said I could be bipolar. Why? Depression, psychosis, chaotic behavior. I believed him. Now I'm not so sure.

Mindfulness exercises always felt like heaven to me. Meditation works wonders. I feel free at these moments specifically. Will a bipolar mind feel such a release with these exercises? Maybe. But will an anxious mind feel like that, provided the exercise works? More probably.

Right now I'm on antipsychotics and two antidepressants. Is it really necessary? I know Reddit won't replace a psychiatrist, I'm just venting and looking for a few words on the issue.",09May2019,1
13,"Am I just being ultra sensitive to this? Whenever my night time pills start working, I get really dizzy, tired, slow, my muscles seem to be working in a different language.
When I get to that point he always asks me “are you fucked up?” “Are you too tucked up to take the dog out.” “Go to bed- your fucked up”

Now I get that it’s a normal phrase but when I think of getting “fucked up” - I see people binging on booze or partaking in too many recreational drugs.

I’m taking them because I need to- not because I’m actively seeking some high. 
Guess what’s why it ducks. To be honest the “high” is pretty uncomfortable.",09May2019,1
14,"I can't. I can't. I can't.

As people in my program stated; ""I'm running on a broken leg, causing irreversible damage."" My grandma expects so much of me. She wants me to be there for Mother's day. I can barely hold on till my family meeting tomorrow. My own doctor thought that going to the hospital could be put on the table.

I brought it up with my oldest sister that I might not be able to be there for Mother's Day due to my mental health and she just got this look in her eye like the ""Why is she my sister?"" look.

I can't handle the stress and the pressure. I just got off the phone with my grandma and she just has these high hopes that I can just push through till Sunday.

What if I fail again???

What if I just disappeared for a while???

15,"so, i know i grew up in an abusive household, but i don’t know how bad.

i don’t remember the abuse, what the apartment looked like, what he looked like, or any smells. my mom says the abuse was BAD and she was hoping i got to the point where my mind completely blocked everything out, but what does that mean?

I have had a lot of stress recently and my bf decided to dump me out of nowhere a month ago. Well I process things weirdly so it really hit me at the beginning of last week. In preparation for that, and to get my anger out, I started working out nearly daily, hanging out with people (old &amp;new), talking to my coworkers about how I feel, making sure I go easy on myself and if I need to, take a step back from current project, I even started drawing again to express my feelings.

* I'm fidgety and restless all the fucking time. In class I squirm around in my seat, at home im squirming around right now. I can't even enjoy a movie 
* Sleep 8-9 hours but will randomly become fatigued, or stay fatigued all day
* I get obsessed over certain things. Interested in photography/illustration/animation = spend all day researching gear and advice. Think about it all day, even dream about it. What usually happens is I will never actually ""do it"". Get the camera and pencils but I get so fidgety/anxious when I want to start. 
* I buy a shit ton of books and never read them
* I think I have an addictive personality, i'm worried that I will ""self medicate"". Lets just say If i'm stressed I spend a lot of time on the internet doing *things* I'm not very proud of and I cant stop for more than a few days.
* My strong, and often critical opinions get on peoples nerves. I think I've lost friends because of this. I know for a fact a few people don't like me in one of my current classes because I either take control or just let everyone do what they want and not help
* I've been depressed in the past. Never wanted to get out of bed, always dreading the day. Now I'm just generally not happy but if something stresses me out I start to feel like my life is going nowhere and have the ""bad thoughts"". Even at my worst in high school loneliness I've never had those thoughts. I'm more scared of death than I thought and I'm not sure why. 
* I go from feeling very hopeful and ""optimistic"" for the future to cynical, sad, angry, or neutral every other day
* High school loneliness turned to college loneliness. I can be kind of awkward but I don't think that's why I cant make new friends

Not sure what to do at the moment. I think i need to take a break from the internet and find a way to relax, but its kinda hard with little to no friends and busy schedule",09May2019,1

32,"I don’t really know what I’m looking to gain from this...

Ive been on a downward spiral for about 9 months. I’ve been increasingly constantly suicidal (ideation, not bold enough to attempt), low, extremely irritable and miserable. I finished my 3rd outpatient group therapy program at the end of March. Ive gone through at least 5-6 therapists and 3 psychiatrist. Ive been on dozens of combinations of medications and dosages and have been weaned off once in the 5 years I’ve been seeking help for my mental health (officially diagnosed with MDD, severe anxiety and PTSD). I quit my (whatever #) job this past Sunday after my shift, had a bad mental breakdown this past Monday night and I’m just.. at a loss. 

I’m going back on an atypical depression med that I was on for about a year and a half following my last hospitalization (late 2015ish) in hopes it might do something. I know it’s not a cure all or happy pill but I honestly don’t know what else I can do. Nothing really works for me, I have all sorts of positive thinking and coping skills I’ve learned and spiritual beliefs that I’ve acquired that no longer work for me and I feel absolutely hopeless. 

I’m questioning anything I’ve ever wanted in life (I.e. family) because I’m starting to think that won’t give me purpose or give me a positive outlook on life. I even am convinced that the kittens I’ve adopted hate me because I’m such a pathetic person that hasn’t responded well to any kind of treatment...

Again, I guess I’m just venting? I’m not sure. I just don’t have much hope for anything and nothing cliche like”it’ll get better” or “it can’t stay this bad forever” helps because it’s bullshit. I’ve been suffering for so long with little relief and I’m exhausted and don’t want to live a life like this.",09May2019,1
33,"I have bipolar 1, I started having catatonic episodes about a year ago, with stupor, cataplexy, akinetic mutism ect. A few weeks ago I felt really bad, stressed, I couldnt stop crying and I felt like I was in a daze and everything was hazy. Suddenly i fell over onto my desk and started hyperventilating, my coworkers helped me lay down as I basically fell to my knees and proceeded to be completely unable to move. It wasnt like I was paralyzed, I just couldnt find the will to move at all. I couldnt even move my eyes when the paramedics were trying to stir me or shining lights in my eyes. When they took blood from my finger, something I'm terrified of, I couldn't fight back at all. Almost all my muscles including half my face were shaking and twitching violently on and off the whole time. I went to the ER and regained my ability to slowly move after 20-30 minutes. I could talk but weakly and quietly, once again it didnt feel like there was anything wrong with my muscles my brain just couldnt send the message to use my limbs to their full capacity.
Anyways, I didnt even end up seeing a doctor or given an explanation. They gave me a paper about altered levels of consciousness which is how I came to the conclusion I've been going catatonic. 
My main is concern is that a certain type of catatonia is fatal, malignant catatonia. Unfortunately there isnt much information online and I am still waiting to get accepted by a psychiatrist (USA!!). Can someone ease my worries...can one type of catatonia turn into another? Has anyone here had malignant catatonia and what did it feel like? How can I alert others if I feel like I need to go to the hospital but I cant speak or move?

And I drew a complete blank. For years now I’ve trained my mind to let go of hope. To protect myself from the disappointment that might happen. For the first time in a long time, I want to bring hope back into my life. So I want to know, what makes you lovely humans feel hope? In the face of what can often feel like immeasurable amounts of pain, what keeps your hope alive?",09May2019,1
35,"I went through a hard time when I was a teenager. When I was 12 I remember I had my first ever panic attack which lead me to the ER.  I would then later on be taken to hospital a few other times due to the same thing, panic attacks. Through out middle school I had really bad anxiety. In 8th grade I thought I wasn’t going to pass on to high school. I thought to myself I’d be held back while everyone else went to high school. 

When I started high school, around 9th grade I began to have a lot of paranoia. I felt like everybody was looking at me or talking about me. It led me to not want to go to school. I didn’t want to be around people. My grades started slipping so bad. I was going to therapy and was even prescribed an antidepressant. 

I felt down for a while. Then there would be days where I’d be completely fine but I’d be out and about with friends. When I would head back to school I’d still be anxious and worried. I felt vulnerable at school. I hated being around people. There was time where I began having thoughts of suicide and even planned to. I remember those bad days I would just stay in bed all day. I wouldn’t do anything. It was hard..

I remember then there being times where I’d stay up all night to talk to friends on myspace/text, make collages, write, make bracelets, etc. You could say I was just being a teenager. Well I also had obsessive thoughts as well. Like I would replay a situation over, obsess over people, etc. I also had weird believes like I thought flies were little cameras flying around, believed the world was out to get me, I thought I was being possessed, I thought I would get my mind read, and more. 

So I never got to graduate and I felt like it was already “too late.” I didn’t have a proper diagnosis. I feel like if I did get a proper diagnosis, which i know it’s hard to for teenagers, it would have helped.",09May2019,2

41,"It all started in January, I agreed to the deal of getting a job before February or my phone service would be cut off. Me being the procrastinator I am, I didnt look too hard for a job until the last minute and started stressing really hard. February came around and I still had service but only had maybe an interview or two that led nowhere at this point. The stress had gotten so bad that one afternoon I had an experience that I'll never forget. Out of nowhere it felt like I had left my body and when I felt like I was back in my body I never felt so scared before. After looking it up, the only answer I could find was depersonalization. I haven't had an experience that bad since then but for weeks after I had trouble paying attention while driving, I'd space off uncontrollably. One day on the way to work I was thinking about that experience wondering about it and I guess it just slowly built up anxiety and stress. While working I had built up a line and I was starting to stress. I nearly had an experience like the one I had described above. I was able to focus on my breathing and everything was fine after that. 

I also wanted to talk about depression. Recently I thought I was gonna get little to no hours this week so I texted the store manager and after finding out hours are given based on performance, I firstly just complained to myself but the next day or so I was thinking about how my chances of any early promotion were ruined and I just got really down in the dumps. Like all of this has been in a short time period. I've only worked there since end of February. Idk I just feel like I give up too easily. Maybe I just think it's easier to quit before it gets hard. 

What bothers me the most out of all of this is just life feels fake. Reality feels fake. When I'm at work talking to customers, it all feels fake. Like I'm in some kind of dream. I just want everything to feel real again. Idk what to do.",09May2019,1
42,"I work as an IT Sales &amp; Support apprentice for a small company in the UK. I took up the role as the apprentice for the qualifications I get after it’s over and done with so I can progress onto something better and move on from this horrible part of my life. I do repetitive tasks day in day out of repair computers, talking on the phone with customers etc. Things I can cope with mentally but then something else happened around 2/3 months ago which has changed everything. 
A co worker , we will call him James. James was our senior sales and support worker, and had been at the company around 5/6 years. He came in and told everyone that he was leaving to move up the top of England with his partner. Sad as I was, we wished him well and he set off. James was our go to engineer as he had been in the trade long enough to know a lot of IT related things, he was also our onsite engineer. 
After he left, my manager turned to me to do the on-sites. Personally, I don’t feel comfortable mentally with going to random peoples houses, no matter how innocent they seem. I have little to no trust in a lot of people and the thought of just going to random peoples house to fix IT problems sounds easy but with someone like me who suffers with Anxiety, constantly overthinks etc. It’s not good. 
I spoke with my manager and expressed how I am feeling towards the situation and said mentally I don’t have it in me to do on-sites. His response was simply “keep doing onsites because the more you do them the more you get used to them”. It’s been 3 months know and I still get anxiety like crazy every time I have to go onsite. This can be around 2/3 times a day, per week. 
As an apprentice, I have set course work I do in work hours. Now that I strictly do onsites only it makes it pretty much impossible to do any coursework at all. I’m falling behind and risk failing my apprenticeship. 
I don’t know what to do, who to talk to or anything. I hate my job and yesterday I was driving and just broke down because I couldn’t take it anymore and I cried and fucking cried. I can’t take much more of this shit. The entire place I work for doesn’t give a toss about mental health and it’s really beginning to affect me big time.

44,"My mind blocks me from ever working to achieve my goals or exercise my full potential. The block is made of: not feeling much joy from doing anything, because I constantly have thoughts that it will go wrong, because that's all that's ever happened. This hasn't just happened in my study/hobby life but even the basic components of my life. Growing up with a dysfunctional, many times abusive family I learned that any sort of happy or fun time can crumble into hatred and dysfunction, and there wouldn't be any indicators because my mother's attitude is very bi-polar and unpredictable.

&amp;#x200B;

I have goals I want to achieve. I've achieved nothing except the bare minimum to be a good student and get to university. That's my version of the basic minimum, because I haven't made a single long-term friend since the 5th grade and I socially isolate myself. Even with mini goals I actually want to do: learn some Italian, write at least 1 chapter of one of the many books I have planned: my mind puts up a block, and all I end up doing is trying to make the time pass by watching stupid youtube videos until I can do the one thing that's blissful to me, which is sleeping. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to unblock my mind. Even passing exams is hard enough. I'm a huge procrastinator and I have no energy. Even though I always get a good night's sleep sometimes I still end up dead tired, even if I'm walking somewhere.   It's torture how I want to do so much to improve myself but I'm too unmotivated to do anything.

He's also very very obsessed with IQ, he views himself as above average but constantly wishes he was a genius in the 140, I asked him to try some IQ test and he was extremely anxious to find out the answer and refused to do it, like he's afraid of getting bad scores, very insecure and self conscious about it. It baffles me, is he afraid of failure concerning his intellect so much to the point where he doesn't want to do the work and just blames the failing on being lazy? He's said it's because he's lazy, but I believe it's something else deeper. I play video games with him sometimes, I noticed when he fails, or loses, he's so hard on himself, he would call himself a degenerate, and say why he's so bad.

Those problems cover many, many arias, from the way I dress, wear my hair to my idiologies, beliefs, morals and so on. I find myself being very frustrated when I have to describe myself, make a choice based solely on my subjectivity and stuff or I can literally find myself loveing something and hateing it in a split second.

48,"I was 14 or 15 when it happened, I am 31 now. We were neighbors and our families are friends so we used to walk home from the school bus stop together. At some point I started reaching over and caressing her waist/lower back. I had never touched a girl in that way so I guess it excited me. She was visibly nervous but didn't say anything, just kept talking to me normally. I did this on several occasions. I think at some point I may have touched her butt, but I don't remember exactly. One day she told me to stop, and I stopped. We never spoke of it again. She continued to be friends with me and she was always so nice. When we got to college she moved away and so did her family, so we stopped seeing each other altogether. For the longest time I forgot all about it. A few years ago our families sort of reconnected so we did as well. She seemed super interested in connecting with me. I started thinking about what I did, and I felt extremely guilty and ashamed. We didn't really end up interacting much and she moved away soon after. Then with the whole #metoo thing and the talk about sexual harassment, I started thinking about it more and I decided to send her a message letting her know I'm really sorry for what I did. She didn't respond to my message. She continued to be Facebook friends with me and would still sometimes like my statuses and whatnot. So I have no idea what to think about how she feels.

It has been a little over a year since I apologized to her, I put it out of my mind for a while, but recently I've started thinking about it again and I can't seem to stop. Right now I'm not the type of person who would ever do something like that and I strive to always respect women, but no matter how good I do now, it won't change the fact that I already did this horrible thing. It's gotten to a point where I am having constant feelings of guilt-induced depression. I feel like I don't deserve anything good in life.

53,"For background, I have Avoidant personality disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and agoraphobia. I see a therapist 2 times a week for this and am prescribed 120x1mg clonazepam/month, 40mg Viibryd( a newer anti-depressant), 2mg risperidone/day, propranolol prn, and 30mg buspar 2x a day. Things were going pretty well up until about 3 weeks ago when I started having suicidal thoughts, extreme depression, etc.

It got so bad that I checked myself into my local hospital's psych ward. This was a terrible experience for me, having my autonomy taken away, not to mention a major conflict with one of the other patients.

Anyway, since getting out of there things have gotten much worse. I have serious suicidal thoughts daily, feel extreme depression daily, etc. In the past few days I have been abusing my Klonopin to no effect. It seems to have stopped working. I am on 30mg as I type this. I a few minutes ago just decided that I have had it. My medications don't work and I want to immediately stop taking them. 

I just flushed 13 bottles of medication down the toilet, including about 50 clonazepam. Every single pill in my house besides 6mg of clonazepam for tomorrow, when I go to see my therapist.

I am going to be experiencing withdrawal from 3 medications at once (clonazepam, Viibryd, and risperidone). I forsee it getting really bad with suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, etc. I will not go to the hospital, because they will put me on my medications again (which do not work anyway)

My question is how do I deal with these withdrawals without going insane during it. I am firm on the fact that I do not want to be on any medications. I'm tired of being a pill fiend. I took the semester off my school for health reasons so I have the time I need to deal with this.",09May2019,1

56,"So I'm 25(m) who suffers from gender dysphoria (I haven't transition... yet) and is easily anxious, the biggest bane being the fact I have never been in a relationship, succeeded economically or socially (I'm slowly working on them but I don't know yet if it's working).

But it's also at least my upbringing (bullied/made fun for my ethnicity, anti-lgbt environment) that have made it very hard for me to accept/feel people's empathy, thus causing me to worry whenever or not anyone actually likes/wants me.

Specifically though when it comes to relationship, 

I'm worried about anything from how my gender dysphoria will affect the relationship, the sex life, would I be able to satisfy my partner and this of course feeds into more anxiety about worrying about a body part I already don't like.

&amp;#x200B;

And this just spirals into an endless stair adding more and more steps towards the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

This has certainly fueled some suicide/self-destructive thoughts, partially due to the frustration of pressure I feel from anxiety but also from a sense of worthlessness.

&amp;#x200B;

Some other info:

To be fair both my gender dysphoria and anxiety is something that come and goes, in the sense that when I'm busy with other things (specifically gender neutral things).

I've had a few panic attacks in the past, the most severe being in my teens where I couldn't sleep in my bed for 3 days, 

and had severe anxiety for at least 2 weeks.

Never been medicated beyond a pollen allergy medicine that is suppose to also have calming properties.

Went to a teenage curator (?) when I hit 20, but that started only because of my gender dysphoria and unfortunately it ended prematurely at age 24, but it certainly helped me a lot. 

Also I did go later on to a clinic that specializes in gender dysphoria, but so far the curator I got there, I haven't felt very comfortable with (I feel a bit uncomfortable with her queer theory and that in the beginning she thought I wasn't sure if I had gender dysphoria).

But since it takes around 1.40 hours just to get there by train, I wanted a more local option for my anxiety, but when I tried both the local curator and psychologist they said that they only treat people who has anxiety that last longer than 11 days and suggested I instead try and go to a church, talk to a friend or other ""groupie"" stuff.

And while I do wanna join some form of local lgbt-support group, I don't want to talk to ""normal"" people about this, but instead with a professional where I can get a more ""controlled"" environment to explore my problem.

I heard peoples voices even tho I was alone and I saw even more shit then usual. Like I saw shit on my fingers and when I closed my eyes I could see patterns and shapes

This bud was shitty quality and nothing special for sure

I feel like i dont care about them when in reality i really want to but i just can't. I want to be able to sympathise with people and be sad for them to show i care but i don't know how.",09May2019,1
65,"Sorry In Advance. 
I fit 5 or more of the criteria for BPD. I was sexually abused as a child, had a tough time growing up, parents split in a NASTY way, constant violence in which the police were ALWAYS involved along with drug use (on the adults part), having to help raise my 5 younger siblings and my mother is bipolar.

I saw a psychotherapist and have been told I have depression and anxiety as well as traits of ptsd and ocd, and that I'm basically borderline BPD including (multiple referrals for DBT). 

It's all got very difficult lately with my moods fluctuating WAY too much and I actually threatened to stab my boyfriend. I felt like because I knew because I couldn't hurt him, the only thing I could do is hurt myself. He took his belongings, then left to stay at his mothers.

My new therapist isnt listening to me, I had to tell HER why I was there because the referral didn't specify, she wants me to participate in EMDR but told her how I'm feeling and she said if I can't find a safe place I can't have therapy. I also told her about my OCD tendencies as I have a ritual with my front door and my bed, that must be done and felt right when doing (long story). She shrugged it off.

TL:DR - BPD tendencies, looking for a bit of support or advice on what I should/can do next.",09May2019,1
66,"Hi, thanks if you read this

I recently seen a psychiatrist not last Friday, but the Friday before that. I think he is an arrogant person who hasn't much of an understanding. I explained to him that I get depressed a lot with outbursts of extreme paranoia and anger. He seemed to overlook what I said and asked if I ever physically assaulted anyone. 

Been telling them repeatedly about paranoia, depression and bizarre thoughts that include violence. And, that I feel like I'm dreaming but it feels real and not dreamlike which involves me arguing with myself believing it's someone else",09May2019,1

At my uni, there’s a disability team that help students who struggle with any type of disability, this included mental health. I went to chat to them because my mental health had started to decline and I wanted to make sure I had a safety net. They put a plan in place that allowed me extra time on assignments if I needed it. 

The past few weeks I’ve been struggling a lot. I wasn’t able to get out of bed at all for days. I couldn’t eat. I either slept all day and night or not at all. I reached out to the service and I got an extension on the assignment I had due. My mental health was still pretty bad and I still couldn’t get the assignment done so I reached out again. This time they weren’t as helpful. He questioned why I couldn’t do it and why I left everything until the last minute to reach out. I couldn’t explain myself. He knows I’ve experienced trauma and he’s aware it effects me but I can’t explain it in-depth enough to help him understand how much I’m effected. 

I guess what I’m trying to get out of this post is, what do I do? Should I try to explain myself to him better? I’m already getting counselling and I just struggle to open up and communicate how I’m feeling.",09May2019,1

I can either have aggressive, circling and repetitive images or sounds in my head that don't mean anything, or I can go weeks without being able to visualize anything at all. My awareness is very low and I feel like I don't have a consciousness anymore and the things I experience on a daily basis can't stock up as memories because there is simply no place to store any memories. This brain fog is killing me, it's making me feel dazed, confused and out of it. I'm constantly bored, uninterested in everything and life just feel like a long ass boring day that never ends. I just can't feel any positive emotions and my moods are always pretty low and unchangeable. It just feels like the physical functions of the body are still working such as the need to eat, sleep and drink water, but mentally and psychologically, I am completely dead inside/absent.

73,"I'm new to Reddit and I'm not very good at spelling, grammar and formatting (using Grammarly and voice to text to try and help) so sorry if this is hard to understand or annoys you because of my mistakes that being said here is my post.

I love my boyfriend so much and I even want to marry him one day but it's so hard to live like we do all the fucking time and It makes me wish I was single often. He has been diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar and I have been diagnosed with ADHD but have undiagnosed mental health problems that I'm trying to treat as best I can.

We both have been through (different) traumatic events in our lifetimes and we reacted to them differently. I'm seeing a therapist and am trying my best to find balance in life but I've never had a good example of that growing up so it's hard to find and maintain. He has tried to see a therapist in the past but has decided that it isn't going to work and that it's hopeless so he just tries the best he can on his own (using me to vent to when he can).

I try my best to understand and be there for him but I don't know how to do that anymore. I can't tell if he's mad about the reason he says he's mad or if that's just the reason he's telling me so he doesn't have to tell me the truth or because he doesn't actually know why. He'll go on and on about x reason he's angry like its the end of the world and the more I try to help the more he gets angry and just keeps going like I'm trying to silence him (like is mum us too). I try to do what he says will help him but it's don't really make a difference.

All of the guessing games about what's wrong now and whether or not it's ok to say anything is getting to me and I don't know what to do. I don't trust my feeling much as it is, I have a cycle of emotions that repeat itself over and over again until I can't tell up from down anymore. I'm getting better at being aware of my negative behaviour Cycles and even seeing the patterns in my behaviour before they cause more problems. It's still hard to tell in the moment what the truth is and if I'm just upset or overwhelmed.

I just want to find a solution but every time I try to suggest one my boyfriend doesn't like it or he will agree to it for like a week and then give up. When I ask him for solutions all I get is ""I think we were both upset and just need to let it go"" or I don't know blah blah blah let's just keep trying without a real plan to fix it.

If anyone knows a way to help or what is a good place to start please let me know, I'm scared that I'm going to give up soon and just stop caring.

76,"I admit that I have personality disorder. And I have no shame in admitting that I am mentally ill. I keep getting thoughts which are making me struggle to survive. All I want is not be around people. I am scared of being around people. I want to be normal. I want to go out. I want to be that fun again. But whenever it actually comes down to going out with people, the nearer it comes, the lesser I wanna do it. I am not able to stand up for myself and I hate that. I need help. Genuine help. I don't know what to do. There's no one to help me out there. One person I thought might be willing to help me to get out of this situation, to help me recover, to help me be normal again, to help me cure this illness, pushes me more towards it. I told him about my condition. And just like everyone out there, he didn't understand. Took it really lightly. Couldn't hold on to me. Couldn't be strong about it. Couldn't help me out. And gave up on me. Because it got harder. I can see myself sinking to a lower level everyday. They say, its not easy to deal with someone who's mentally weak. And I know I am not easy to deal with right now. I just didn't know he will give up on me and not be there for me when needed. My personality splits into different aspects - I forget who I am, I am unable to sense my feelings and my thoughts. Sometimes it scares me because I start screaming, arguing, being violent, crying on the floor. Its traumatic and I am afraid of it now. I have this fear which doesn't just go away. I need help. I have lots of nightmares and anxiety. I get triggered sometimes, like something will happen right now and it will remind me of past events and that triggers anxiety, flashbacks or nightmares. I don't want to self-harm but I don't know what to do. I have intense emotions and abandonment issues. I’m afraid that people will get sick of dealing with me and get up and leave. And when I find some strength to not believe that, they just prove me right. I had horrible mood swings. I tried not to get close to people so I wouldn’t lose them. And I was angry. I never expressed it externally, rather, I took it out on myself in forms of self-harm. . I’m very clingy and have an almost childlike attachment to him. I’d do anything for him and am not sure how I’d live without him. I struggle when he is gone. It’s not something I bring on myself. It’s fact. I used to be afraid he wouldn’t come back. Now, I know better. There have been times when I’d rather die than live through the pain of separation. I go through so many emotional conflicts daily and whatever your opinion may be, sometimes it’s appropriate to get more information before you pass judgment. Its going to take a lot of hard work and I just need people who can give all the positive vibes to me. Who can stand up with me. Who can be there for me. True it is that they say, you get to know who loves you for real, when you actually need them. People take mental illness really lightly and do not take it seriously but knowing what I go through everyday, looking at myself struggling everyday, I know I am not well. Maybe he's just there to teach me how to live by myself even when its hard because no one and I mean it no one is going to be there for you when its actually needed and you will have to fight your own battles. I don't what role love plays in this. I always thought it makes you stronger. The person makes you stronger. But here its just making me weaker everyday. And I don't want that when I am trying to work on my mental condition everyday. Not everyone can deal with you when you're not easy to deal with which is when its most required. And I know he's one of them. Your partner says that he's going to be there for you in your ups and downs but they don't stand up to it when it gets hard and prove me right. I have always had trust issues and people have been proving me right about it. Am I crazy? I wanna be fine and normal again. I really do.",09May2019,1

79,"I was watching a youtube video that was completely unrelated to mental health. But the guy talking mentioned that he had read ‘The subtle art of not giving a f*ck: A counterintuitive approach to living a good life’ by Mark Manson, and mentioned that it changed his life.

So I decided to give it a go and started reading it a few days ago. I’m only half way through but it is an eye opener. It is basically about us choosing what we care about and what we don’t care about and the reasons for that.

I know for a lot of people in this group it’s not as easy as just choosing what you care about, but for anyone struggling with anxiety I would highly recommend reading it. 

But try not to take it the wrong way. It does come across as quite arrogant and kind of holier than thou the way it is written, and might cause you to take offence, but trust me, it is completely worth the time to read it. 

I’ve found myself thinking about the things I want in life and the things I care about that I probably shouldn’t give a fuck about, and beginning to understand why I care about these things.

I’m all for expressing emotions in a healthy manner and using music as an emotional outlet, and certainly want to hear music that is honest... but not at the cost of minimizing the pain and struggles that people all over the world face on a daily basis. 

Being broken is not beautiful, being broken is sobbing uncontrollably when you have a delay getting your meds refilled while your boyfriend strokes your hair trying to convince you that things will get better. 

Addiction is not the modern day version of Romeo and Juliet, addiction is an irreversible virus at best or a death sentence at worst.

82,"I've always longed that I had a normal loving childhood.

An emotionally, verbally, and physically abusive mother and sister, an absent father (he was there but was barely at home), an emotionally distant brother. When I spent time at my friends' house, I would always wonder how it would feel like if I had the same accommodating household. At the peak of my mental health issues (self harm, a suicide attempt), my family was clueless that anything was wrong. 

When I wanted to seek professional help and approached my parents, I was met with odd responses. *You're dramatic. People who seek help are insane and non-functioning ones. You're alright.* 

I had to go behind their back to go to therapy two years ago. I had to handle everything alone (aside from a few valuable friends). 

Sometimes I get absolutely sad. While I'm better now (clean for a year, no signs of suicidal thoughts, can actually function and be productive, have long-term goals), I still get dragged back to the two decades of my life that I lost because I couldn't get help. When I get small triggers for self harm, it still stings and I remember the days I used to cover up my wrists and thighs and cry myself because I hurt myself again. It scares me because I don't want to go back to being sad.

I know self-acceptance and self-acknowledgement are important in growing. But sometimes I just wish as though I didn't go through everything - that I had a normal childhood. When I need to explain to people why I act the way I do and why I'm no longer in contact with my family, my heart just sinks a little.

    Do Mental Health Professionals (MHP for short after this) distinguish between clincial depression (by which I mean a chemical imbalance leading to depression) and rational depression (rotten luck for lack of a better term).

    * Why or why not?
    * If the answer is no, does this imply a bias towards medication and the drug industry?
    * If the answer is yes, does this imply a bias towards the ""easy treatment"" on behalf of professionals.

    There are literally thousands of reasons that I'm tyring to prompt a discussion on this.  Overall, I've found it very difficult to get a read on the answer to this question.  I've gotten vastly differing opinoins on the subject and the deeper I dig through research and articles the more confused the issue gets.

I’m just looking if anyone has had similar experiences or anything so I can figure out what’s happening to me.

So there’s something that I’ve experienced very rarely in my life, I can’t really think of when it started but the first clear example I remember I would’ve been about 12-13 but I’m pretty sure it happened earlier. Pretty much sometimes I get a feeling of complete burden and dread and usually believe that I am responsible for something great and terrible that’s going to happen. The first episode I believed something to do with ... triangles?? And that I was about to end the world. This one happened when I was sleeping and woke up with this feeling and was completely distraught and crying hysterically telling my step dad that I was going to end the world and I just paced up and down the house trying to stop it. 
Another time I believe that I had to re do everything in the world that has ever happened two times over and live everything and ensure that it gets done. This time was also at night after I woke up but it also happens when I’m sick or randomly as well. I don’t think it is to do with dreams etc but my mind just gets switched into this weird mode of thinking when I’m vulnerable?? Idk how to explain. It used to only happen every few years but now it happens every few months so I’m not sure. 

Does anyone know what’s happening to me?
It usually lasts a few hours depending if people are around because it’s comforting when they are and I can go back to sleep/calm down

94,"Just had the realization today as I feel ""off"" (best way I can describe it - basically not much motivation to get any work done today in the office, unsure of what I feel like doing for lunch...minor things, but this happens from time to time), that it may be tied to the weather.   For example, today is overcast and will likely rain; for several days in a row before this it's been bright and sunny and enjoyable.  

Is it my imagination / I'm doing this to myself?  Or is my mood / emotions being tied to what's going on outside not a crazy notion?  

Some background - I don't *think* that I'm experiencing any long-term mental health issues, but there are days where I feel ""off"" as described above.  Not really certain of the causes but 90% of the time I'd say I am ""healthy"".

It's hard to enjoy the things that I love as well. When I was in school, I daydreamed about all the free time I would have to do things I enjoyed, but now I have a hard time enjoying them. In fact, I feel a similar kind of stress that I felt when I did homework. I still have that feeling of dread where there aren't enough hours in a day to do what I want to do, even though I literally have ALL day.

I don't know how to wind down from this. How do I stop feeling so wound up and start enjoying the things I want to be enjoying?

I told her all this, and she recommended seeing a counselor, even offered to go with me. I’ve been before and it helped a lot, but my challenge now, and maybe the cause of anxiety is I am in a transitional state. 

Just got a new job, new car, falling in love, and moving to a new city. Great things, but stress keeps me up at night. For my new job I’ll be living in different hotel rooms for the first 4 months. When I come home my girlfriend will be overseas for a year (military, both of us.)

Lots of travel, a dream come true for everyone, but I don’t stay in one place long enough get  consistent help at one location.

Money isn’t a big issue. I am lucky, and a very frugal man, so can afford to get help.

He's a sweet person, and honestly, my ability to be open and communicative has improved so much because of him.  We are both extremely open to each other about our struggles with mental health, and we have done our best to support each other when the other is having a rough time.  We only hang out in person 3-5 times a week, but we text semi-frequently outside of that so that we don't feel suffocated by each other.  As far as I'm concerned, our relationship is pretty healthy.

I wasn't even adequately able to support him, which I feel so guilty about.  He feels guilty about it too whenever this happens because he feels unable to support me.

Felt..great after though.

One day I started doing this thing where I would caress her waist and lower back. I had never touched a girl this way before so I guess it excited me. She was visibly nervous but didn't say anything and just kept talking to me like normal. I did this on several occasions and may have touched her butt at some point. One day she told me to stop, so I stopped and we never spoke of it again and continued being friends like normal. After high school she moved away and we stopped seeing each other but we stay connected on Facebook. We wouldn't interact much, but on the occasions when we would, she would always be super nice and friendly. I stopped thinking about this entirely up until a few years ago. Then about a year ago with all the talk about sexual harassment, I started to think about it more, so I sent her a message telling her I am really sorry for what I did and that I feel extremely guilty. She didn't reply to my message and continued to be friends with me on Facebook like normal. So I have no idea what to think about how she feels.

But now I can't seem to stop thinking about it and the guilt is causing me severe depression. I was clueless about this stuff back then and I am not the type of person who would ever do this kind of thing now, but that doesn't change the fact that i did it.

121,"New to this sub, but felt it may be an appropriate place to share this. 

I was diagnosed with depression at 13 years old, generalized anxiety disorder at 17, after a week-long episode of inability to catch my breath and chest pains. I went to my doctor afraid I had a heart or lung condition, he prescribed me the lowest dose of xanax (I have been off of it for a year, no addiction issues) and basically told me to chill tf out and that I was too young to be so upset. I later went to a therapist and stopped after 3 sessions because it wasn't helpful and didn't feel authentic. I occasionally consider trying a therapy/counseling again. 

Over the years, I have experienced more than I would wish on anyone. From sexual assault, to loss of a parent, to parental neglect/abandonment. I've been through a lot, on top of my genetic mental disorders. 

I have experienced severe, debilitating panic attacks; suicidal thoughts and actions; substance abuse (alcohol), the whole works. 

Yet despite everything, I work 55 hours a week at a high-stress job amd have been successful (with a few minor fuck-ups that have not been detrimental). 

I forced myself from a young age to be optimistic. The death of the most important person in my life at 15 years old gave me a valuable perspective-- life is short. His death was unexpected and sudden. He was 62. He was supposed to live longer, to see me graduate high school and college. I was and still am angry and heart broken. 7 years have passed, but the emotional wound will always be tender. 

When negative thoughts arise, I often tell them I don't have time for them. I put them in a metaphorical box and stuff them in a closet of my mind. 

Yet the next time those negative thoughts/memories come knocking, they are louder, more aggressive, almost offended that they've been ignored. 

So inevitably, those dark thoughts refuse to be quieted. I am forced to surrender and face defeat, even if just for a few days. 

But I always regain mental composure. There is always a new day to begin again and for simple pleasures to be found. I must say I am always.so relieved when the mental/emotional thunderstorm passes and I am reunited with myself.

So I just wanted to say that it is okay to have a bad day, or week, or month, or even year
 Forgive yourself, your mind, your soul. Allow yourself the time and space to cope. But know that this too shall pass; remind yourself that you survived even your worst days. You will overcome today as well.

122,"Sorry, long post coming up but I just need a place to vent after i just had another 2 hour fight with my girlfriend about her situation. My girlfriend is an amazing person, she is kind and outgoing and very sure of what she wants and who she wants to be, she's also depressed and suffering, two thing that don't go together very well  
She has been struggling with panic attacks and a nervous stomach (to put it lightly) and ultimately depression for the last two years. It all started when she was on a trip abroad and she got really ill. She always used to be so sure of herself and she had a positive attitude towards life. But this experience abroad changed everything. She started feeling really sick whenever we made plans to go out. It wasn't obvious that it was anything psychological at first but soon she felt unable to even go to the store alone. She described to me what sounded a lot like mild panic attacks and soon she avoided a lot of everyday situations and left the house less and less.  
Having gone through about 3 years of depression and anxiety attacks + social anxiety myself  i always tried to provide her with things that i have learned  and that helped me to get better. The problem is she failed to recognize that our situations where similar at all. She kept insisting that she wasn't ""that kind of person"", basically saying that because she had never struggled with mental health before she was actually fine, she only had that ""little problem"" that had completely took over her life by now. I kept trying to talk to her about it and how i only got better after i realized that i had some severe underlying issues in how i viewed myself and the kind of expectations i had of myself but she wouldn't hear any of it. She kept insisting that her situation is completely different in that she is actually fine but has this one very unique problem, failing to see that the world isn't split into people who are ""just fine"" and have a problem and people who have ""actual"" mental health issues. After talking to her a lot about this it became clear to me that she couldn't admit to herself that she actually had a serious issue.   
She even started seeing a psychiatrist but she kept telling me that she ""finally wanted to get this fixed"" and she expected to be completely back to normal in the matter of a couple sessions. She even said right from the start that she wouldn't mind just taking some drug that eliminated her problems. As it turns out it wasn't that easy and upon realizing this she insisted that therapy wasn't for her and that she finally needed someone to fix her quickly. She is the kind of person that just wants to get things done and over with, she even set herself goals like ""I'll get rid of this in the course of the next two months"" which i actually kind of admire but this underlying pressure to get this fixed asap and moving on with her life instead of looking into herself and finding out what might cause her to feel this way is standing in her way a lot.   
Every time we talk about this it ends up in a fight. I so desperately want to help her, because i know how miserable it is in that place that she's in but she is just so convinced that nobody understands her problem, not me, not her mum, no doctor or psychiatrist. She's just not that kind of person... How do you provide help to someone who doesn't believe you when you say you know how they feel? Have you ever been in this situation? What can i do?",09May2019,1

my father lives about an hour's train ride away, and i don't visit him as much anymore because i got my first job, and i like working there, and have fun with my colleagues there, so he visits me every once a month or the seems, but my mother lives in the same city, about 15 minutes walk from me, and i see her much more often, i'm not sure if that's any help to this...

only one i feel i can be truly ME around is my big brother since we've grown up together, but i feel scared....my mothers getting older, and one day she might not be here anymore, so why do i act this way?? why am i like a cold person that can't treat her or tell her the words she wants to hear...it's very rare i've ever uttered that i ''love'' her and i feel ashamed for it, she's been so loving towards me my entire life and i feel like i'm acting towards her like i don't give a shit....even when we talk on the phone i've begun talking as if i have no emotions and i don't know what i feel...i feel empty, until i don't talk anymore and i feel horrible because she's the only mother i have...


One friend i've had due to my childhood things, and how i am suggested i took therapy, but i lashed out onto them and took that as an insult because i dislike and refuse to show ''weakness'' i admit all that is my fault because i felt it was an insult but....i'm not sure, i don't know how to describe myself further than i have, i just want to figure out how i can either convey how i am, and or getting rid of this ''cold'' me inside me....i've broken down in tears infront of my brother because i treated her badly long ago and i explained it to her, but AGAIN, i talk like it has no emotional impact on me, and it feels so wrong and horrible....

science has  been making me nervous and anxious stuff like atoms and the fact that everything is moving around me.

&amp;#x200B;

My dad (65) is having (what ER docs ended up calling) a severe, hypo manic episode.  As far as I know, this is completely out of the blue.  He has pressure of speech and is definitely (although he insists he is ""100% OK"") not himself.  All blood tests/scans/etc. came back clear.  We are waiting to see a specialist on the 16th but until then, my mom and I are just trying to keep him calm and occupied.  

&amp;#x200B;

After explaining the situation, my own psychiatrist (I have chronic anxiety/depression) suggested the possibility that he has been ""high functioning"" with Bipolar Disorder his whole life.  His father had Bipolar Disorder, so this makes sense to me.  When I brought this up to my mother, she was adamant that there was no way he could have hidden it from her all these years-- ""that ""they"" can hide it from work, but not from home"".

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, is this even possible?  Could my father have been ""high functioning"" with Bipolar Disorder for 65 years?

&amp;#x200B;

Any insights/thoughts/experiences/anything would really help.  I'm pretty lost rn.

131,"of course I can’t get diagnosed here but I’m curious what you guys think?

I went through a hard time when I was a teenager. When I was 12 I remember I had my first ever panic attack which lead me to the ER.  I would then later on be taken to hospital a few other times due to the same thing, panic attacks. Through out middle school I had really bad anxiety. In 8th grade I thought I wasn’t going to pass on to high school. I thought to myself I’d be held back while everyone else went to high school. 

When I started high school, around 9th grade I began to have a lot of paranoia. I felt like everybody was looking at me or talking about me. It led me to not want to go to school. I didn’t want to be around people. My grades started slipping so bad. I was going to therapy and was even prescribed an antidepressant. 

I felt down for a while. Then there would be days where I’d be completely fine but I’d be out and about with friends. When I would head back to school I’d still be anxious and worried. I felt vulnerable at school. I hated being around people. There was time where I began having thoughts of suicide and even planned to. I remember those bad days I would just stay in bed all day. I wouldn’t do anything. It was hard..

I remember then there being times where I’d stay up all night to talk to friends on myspace/text, make collages, write, make bracelets, etc. You could say I was just being a teenager. Well I also had obsessive thoughts as well. Like I would replay a situation over, obsess over people, etc. I also had weird believes like I thought flies were little cameras flying around, believed the world was out to get me, I thought I was being possessed, I thought I would get my mind read, and more. 

So I never got to graduate and I felt like it was already “too late.” I didn’t have a proper diagnosis. I feel like if I did get a proper diagnosis, which i know it’s hard to for teenagers, it would have helped.

Btw I was only diagnosed with generalized anxiety, OCD, and depression.

Im 24 now and I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 after having a manic episode following a depressive one as well. Could I have been showing signs at a young age?",09May2019,1

Not like DID, or anything, but now instead of talking down to myself, it was this other person (Who I ended up calling Erika, which changed to Lilith). And it was *bad*. I already spoke to my therapist about it, and she confirmed to me that this was just a coping mechanism (much like Tony was for Danny in the shining, please don't attack me if that interpretation is wrong).

Since then I started to try to ""get checked"". I live in the UK and this was the first time I went to a GP. I didn't know how to put it so I asked how I could get help for my mental health and and the GP made me contact a local ""mental wellbeing service"". I had my first appointment yesterday, after 1 month I had applied and it was a telephone appointment. This was supposed to be a general assessment I think, because after I tried to explain my ""symptoms"" they put me on a program for anxiety (they do cbt therapy). Unfortunately I wasn't able to express all the things that I had written in that post and I think I didnt give all the information that I wanted to give about me.

141,"I just feel like I'm going to d i e alone and a loner because no one seems to care and no one sees that I'm suffering. It's not just that I feel like I'm unable to tell people how I feel and that I should just suffer in silence because I will only bring others down by being negative and I feel like I can't talk about anything that isn't the everyday small talk. . 

It's getting to the point where I don't care if I just died. I don't care if I make my mother hurt even more. I don't care if I just killed myself because no one will miss me and no one will notice because I am emotionless and a waste of oxygen. I don't know how to tell people that I need help like most people don't even want to help me. tbh my support group doesn't help because the only people who talk to me are the people who are kind of forced to talk to me . But even then I just pretend to be fine and say that I'm fine when I want to die . I have just been too scared to tell people how I feel and its killing me. People have told me that things are going to get better and when I was 13 I tried to end my life multiple times but things have only gotten worse. I have been thinking about this for months and I have been to much of a coward to say that I feel like this. I listen to sad music and make myself even more sad. I keep things inside instead of telling people how I feel.  just the problem is that because I'm emotionless due to the expectation of a guy these days that your not allowed to be sad and your not supposed to cry because then your weak then people wonder why I don't show any emotion and act like a fucking robot. I'm sick of acting Happy and acting happy. I don't want to let anyone in. I don't even understand what I feel myself. I listen to music and still want to d i e . Being around people doesn't work no more. When Im down all I want to do is listen to music but it doesn't work no more. I don't speak about how I feel because I feel negative and I would rather suffer in silence and die than hurt anyone else. I don't care about gaming no more I don't care about music anymore I don't care about anything anymore. 


I admit I am emotionally scared to let anyone inside
So I just put on a front and have a blank expression and pretend to be fine. You might get me to talk about anything else but not feelings not how I feel 'Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me and I don't want to bring you down with my ploblems so
I'll be the only person that I can blame when you leave me. I am lost in my own conscience
I know that shutting the world out ain't solving the problem. 


I feel like I can't speak my true feelings anymore and I feel like haven't got a voice to say anything. No one rants or vents to me. I'm way too anxious to ask for help and it kills me not to have someone in real life I can just be open with all of my feelings without being told that it's just a part of being a teenager or being told that other people feel the same way but then they don't actually help me. I've been trying to cry for help from them but it's gotten me nowhere no matter how hard I try things don't change. I'm happy at college and things go smoothly but as soon as I leave and I'm not around people I like and I talk to. I feel like shit but I hide it from my mom and my family because I'm just a stupid teenager and I don't feel that way. I tried to tell her how I feel she just says that I don't care about her and I don't appreciate her and its like she doesn't care about me or why I'm feeling that way and I have to be around people I like and talk to or I feel like crying but it's getting even worse to handle and I can't even form words sometimes. I don't know what to do to stop this feeling. It's either i feel like I want to d i e or I feel nothing. It's getting to the point where I can't cry no matter how sad I feel but because I don't cry and I don't try to kill myself constantly I'm not depressed. Others have it much worse than me so I suffer alone because I couldn't be depressed. I'm not on medication and I don't hang out very often because no one seems to want to be my friend. I just want to d i e. Everything makes me sad but I pretend to be fine because I'm too scared to tell people how I really feel. I listen to sad music because I really feel the same way but it doesn't help me. I feel I'm just going to d i e alone and I no one really see the true me.",09May2019,1

144,"A few weeks ago I went to counseling and was told that it seemed as though I was experiencing seizures, which was causing a gap in my memory. This made loads of sense to me and explained lots of my experiences in the past.

She is also a counselor at the university, and head of the counseling department.

After this came up, I was able to recognize what presented itself as seizures. So I reported it to the university in order to have accommodations and so my professors knew what was happening. They called her to talk about it, and she told the university that she had no idea what had happened.

I had a panic attack today and had to have an emergency meeting with her, where she told me that she never once brought up seizures and that I need to stop coming up with stuff that I just think that I have. 

She also tends to focus a lot on how unstable I am and unlikely to succeed in the state that I am in. This only makes me feel worse and as though I can’t trust myself. I have brought this up many times in counseling and it tends to be walked around. She rarely if ever focuses on my good qualities. 

Usually when she talks to me and I’m “headed in the wrong direction” she picks up a very authoritative tone and sounds condescending. She also repeats her points of what she thinks I should do, and interrupts me a lot. 

Because of this behavior, I often feel too ashamed to bring up anything too deep, and feel as though I have to act I front of her instead of fully be myself.

I feel like this is making the situation worse than better. But maybe I truly am this unstable and making these things up in my mind? I don’t know how to take this",09May2019,1
145,"I have been wondering about this for a while now. When I say very intense love for space and astronomy I don't mean that I am simply keen on it or even just really into it: my love is an obsession and a fixation that takes up the majority of my day and dreams as well and I don't think I ever go as much as 10 seconds without thinking about astronomy. I cry at least once per day because I might casually witness something related to space, no matter how distant that relation is, like seeing a dog and crying because Laika was sent to space. I graduate very soon and the thought of pursuing any degree other than astrophysics or, worst case scenario, aerospace engineering, makes me extremely suicidal even though I know that I can still study it later or work in a related field. I started seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist on February and a while before that I realized that the thought of not doing what I love full time has been the main catalyst of most of my (diagnosed) depression, anxiety, and intrusive thoughts. Sorry this got so long, I just wanted to fully paint a good picture of what my love is like.

However, I am wondering if it all has a connection to my mental illnesses. I rewatched Girl, Interrupted and I looked up symptoms of BPD (something that I am not diagnosed with but my therapist thinks that I might suffer from) and I noticed that almost all of them apply to me. What stood out to me however was the bit about identity disturbances. I have a very good memory and I remember that since I was a very very young child I had no sense of identity, could not tell where I ended and the outside world began, and I could not describe myself. The only stable part of my identity that I recognize with ease and that there is no doubt about is my love for space, and I feel as though if I did not pursue it to the very end I would disappear off of existence. I obviously enjoy a lot of other things and since I got on Zoloft and started seeing my therapist I have been doing better than I ever have but I cannot shake away or alter the feeling that outside of my love for space I am nothing at all. I feel like I don't exist and as I'm typing this I am confused as to who ""I"" is that I keep referring to, and please don't comment things like ""you are more than just space!"" because I don't feel like I am in a position to agree without experiencing some sort of existential crisis lmao. 

Other things that I think may be related are my very intense maladaptive daydreaming, dissociation, and emotional and physical parental abuse since childhood. I have written a post about maladaptive daydreaming before if it interests you. I almost cannot tell it apart from dissociation because they happen at the same time, rarely one without the other. When I dissociate and no daydreaming is happening is one of the most terrifying things I have ever experienced and it is what I imagine ""I"" would be like if space was not there to fill the gap where ""I"" should be. 

I also remember the moment I fell in love with space. I must have been on the older end of five and I remember watching a documentary with my mom on the TV and I don't remember how I understood the concept of space, but I do remember an amazing feeling of an explosion inside my head, like being able to see color for the first time. Since then there has been no moment that has gone by without a thought of the stars. 

I have brought this up with my therapist and she thinks it's too early to say yet, but it's the main topic of our sessions. I am curious as to what this community has to say, though. Thank you for reading this post till the end, you have no idea how much it means to me.",09May2019,2

148,"Long story short, I’ve been on my last straw and believe it’s finally time to consider medication. I won’t go into any detail about myself, because I just want to know whether it’s worth trying or not. 

I’ve done tons of research on different peoples experiences and have also talked to friends who struggle with mental health. I’ve had a friend say medication has changed and saved her life, and that she 100% recommends it, but I also have a friend who said it’s not worth it and that if I do decide to go down this road that I need to “be careful”. My mom also struggles with her mental health and like my one friend, has told me that experiencing with medication is a long and unpredictable road and it could take years until I find the “perfect” medication or dosage. 

If you do or have tried taking medication, do you recommend it? Did you help you? What are you on (also: what have you previously been on, if applicable?) and how long did it take for the medication to work? How much does it typically cost with insurance but also without insurance? (I don’t have insurance right now and won’t get it for about 3 months but I can’t keep living like this so I don’t really care whether or not I have insurance.)

149,"Ever since a couple of years ago, I’ve had the fear that something really bad was going to happen to me at some point in the future. It would be some kind of torture That I couldn’t escape from.

Additionally, I’ve also had the fear of evil, or some evil forces or devil trying to get me. Now, this isn’t a disorder because it doesn’t really affect me, a race,. Rather, I only noticed it when I tell myself I’m in control or powerful. For example, I might tell myself that life is easy or I can figure this out, then this superstitious feeling comes in saying “I will make bad things happen to you if you claim power like that.”

As I write this it sounds very crazy, but it barely affects me and I’m not hearing voices or anything. It’s just a subtle feeling.

With this being said, last night I stayed up really late and as I was falling asleep, I got this evil feeling again. Only this time it was much stronger. It felt sort of like a Vortx that was pulling me in. I think that part of it was absolutely the fact that I was falling asleep so I was partially in dream state. However it was terrifying nonetheless. If I ignored the feeling, I would just have this panicky awful feeling inside. 

Something inside me told me to go into the feeling, or focus on it. That was the only way to make it go away. But when I did that, it felt like I was directly challenging this evil force, and I therefore was going to get punished (for lack of a better word). This goes back to the superstitious feeling. My ears started ringing, I felt like I was spiraling into chaos, or some form of hell. I wondered if it was ever going to end. If Satan had captured my soul.

Now, I use a lot of words like satan, but I’m not delusional. These are just words I’ve used to help explain the feelings I’m having. I know it absolutely could all be in my head. But nevertheless it’s terrifying and I can’t fight this deep fear that I’m going to get stuck in this.",09May2019,1
150,"Hi guys!

Just had a question regarding an experience I had ... about one hour ago! 

As I was scrolling through Instagram, I was watching a friend’s instastory of a few friends hanging out (after doing a bible study). I wasn’t able to make it tonight due to going to my psychotherapist. I didn’t feel bad about missing out on it as I would try to get to the next one. 

I noticed that during the video, a particular person was in the background, and I got so annoyed! I was asking myself “uhhh why is he there? Wish he would just go away”. I was able to  that I had an emotional reaction and after a few minutes, it went away. It was quite intense feeling. 

So for context, myself and this person haven’t spoken properly in months. He would have been someone who I would have called one of my best friends last year. I went to psychotherapy last September as a result of the lost of friendship and its impact on me. We recognized in counseling that I was taking 100% responsibility for the end of it and that I had to give some over to him. I sent an email to him last summer a month after we met up and explained my side of the story and he just disagreed with it (it is what it is). I’ve been feeling 150% better in myself and even grateful for the situation to learn and grow myself from it from last summer to now. He said some things last year that was quite personal and unnecessary from the situations that happened last year and I feel my gut has been saying “nah, don’t try to be close with him again”. Throughout the year, I wasn’t really comfortable talking to him, as it felt the situation overall was just pushed under the rug. The few times we talked, it was just jokes and I always left feeling “I really wished I didn’t engage in that” (this is just feeling like I’m there for a laugh and chuckle and not as a friend, or the way we were before I guess).

I rather not have this reaction to him, even on someone’s instastory or in person. I am aware I need to do some inner work myself so I’m just wondering if others had been through something similar, and how to work through it yourself. I plan to bring it up next week at counseling but I would be interested in hearing other examples to start the process or additional things to help.",09May2019,1

155,"Hello, today I made my first Reddit account after lurking for many years. I made it because I feel so lost in life. I don't know what to do. I don't even know if this is the right sub for this. Let me start by saying, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety. This anxiety will cause depressive episodes, and I also have mild social anxiety that manifests more as me having zero confidence to talk with people I don't know, introduce myself, and ""put myself out there"". I don't go to therapy because I simply can't afford it and I also convince myself that I don't need it. Anyway, I'm really struggling right now with my anxiety and it's bringing on a depressive episode. What's causing this is my lack of direction in my career. I know this is a common issue among people, but I haven't really reached out to ask for help because usually my family or my partner's family are constantly barraging me with suggestions and questions. But I need to reach out. I'm expected by my partner and my family and his family to get on a career path. 

I currently have a job working in mental health ironically. I enjoy it, but due to my upbringing and my personality, I can usually find a way to enjoy anything. I'm also incredibly stubborn and I don't like to give up when things get difficult. It's been a way for me to cope with my anxiety and has helped me learn about myself and figure things out. But, I'm tired. I'm burnt out and I have medical issues that require better health insurance and pay so I can afford meds. Part of me wants someone to just point me in the right direction of what I should do. But then I know that's never how life works. I've been applying to other jobs, trying to get out of the company I'm in, trying to get out of mental health because I don't think I'm cut for it. No matter what I'm burnt out. But I don't know what to apply to anymore. Every job I've applied to has not contacted me back. Due to my work schedule I don't have time for a social life so I don't have a way to network, I don't even know how to network without looking desperate. At one point I bought a url because I thought, ""Oh, I'll start writing a blog about my medical issues that I deal with daily and maybe I can grow that into a business, a community."" I bought that in January. I've gotten so discouraged with working on that too because I don't know how to make a logo and at this point I feel it's been a failure just because I haven't been able to get it off the ground.

It seems I have this cycle going on where I have a job, I'm constantly burnt out but still trying. I think, ok, I'll work on getting a new job. But what should I be applying to with a bachelors in psychology that's not mental health? Ok, well, I'll just apply to jobs that sound interesting that I mostly qualify for. I write cover letters, I reformat my resume, I do my best to tailor myself to look like the best candidate I can be without blatantly lying. The only responses I get are the ""thank you for applying"" and the very rare, ""We've decided to move forward with other candidates"". I follow up after a week, no response. I get discouraged and stop applying. My partner gets on me about not applying because he wants to see me happy and not so drained when I get home. I think about the blog, I think of logos and scrap them never even trying to get feedback. I give up, focus on my job, trying to manage through and just focus on getting through to the next checkpoint I have in life, getting a house and having two kids. But that is where the cycle begins again, I burn out again, look and apply to jobs, and etc.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel worthless in this life and I feel like I'm not even making a difference in my job. I have always looked forward to having kids, but I don't want to bring any into my life or care just for meaning and I would love to have at least an idea, a foothold, to a career before I have any.

I know this has been a long post, and I truly appreciate anyone that digs through reading this. If you have any advice, relatable stories, words of wisdom, or just something to say, I appreciate it all. I just needed to fully express myself and be heard, if someone knows how to help I'm definitely open to it.

Thank you.",09May2019,1
156,"Hey all. I struggle with depression, generalized anxiety, and severe ADHD. Occasionally I feel a burst of guilt with no trigger whatsoever, and I can't figure out what's causing it. It doesn't feel like anxiety or a panic attack, just pure guilt and shame. This has happened since I was a small child, but I find it getting more common. It can last from minutes to hours. Does anybody else experience this?",09May2019,22
157,"It feels like a lot of times when im trying to relax or go to sleep that I get all worked up with some kind of weird internal argument with myself about things that make me mad or upset, and I don't know how to deal with it, and it seems like (especially on state healthcare) that any kind of therapy or help for that, along with a multitude of other mental and anxiety issues, is exceedingly hard to access. I was hoping maybe some people here could share their thoughts, insights, and possible solutions.",09May2019,1
158,"So after years of being misdiagnosed, I finally was sent to the best mental health institution my country has to offer, was diagnosed as bipolar 2 with bpd. My meds were modified to help alleviate symptoms, and without a doubt I'm more functional now than I have been in almost 3 years. My depression and hypomania are less intense and don't last as long, my anxiety doesn't completely cripple me, and I can have structure to my days... except, there's one part of the cycle that I just can't seem to get control over and I can't seem to overcome it.

I suffer from chronic migraines. I know that they are impacted by weather, and diet, but I've also noticed that they coincide with a few days of accentuated symptoms. It starts with anxiety, which leads to sleep problems, which leads to depression, which leads to insomnia. I tried to intervene in the cycle this time - I had something I really needed to do today - I used zopiclone to counteract the insomnia, but the migraine still came. It happens so often now that I question the causal chain. I'm not sure why, but it feels like subconscious subterfuge. My migraines can last days at a time, and they interrupt so many important things in my life.

I'm wondering if anyone else has noticed a link between migraines and their mental health, and if so what they might have done to help control them. I'm trying not to let this destabilize the stability I've gained, but this is 3 times now in the last 2 months where I've missed an important appointment because of this exact series of symptoms over the course of 3-4 days.",09May2019,1

IF you are depressed you are living in the Past.
IF you are anxious you are living in the Future.
IF you are at peace you are living in the Present.

160,"I am currently working with a counselor through my university. 

I often leave our appointments feeling more confused than I did before and as though the road to healing is more daunting than before. It seems as though I can never process through my feelings without her interrupting me and assertively, if not almost aggressively.

They often ask me for examples while I’m getting out hard feelings, and when I freeze she gives me her opinion of what I’m doing. 

They treat me as though many things things that I am doing myself is wrong. If I do not go along with what she tells me to do, she often brings it back up on an “I told you so manner.”

I’ve attempted to talk to her about this, and it improves for a little but then gets worse again. 

I also often leave feeling as though I can’t trust myself and I need to trust her more than myself. It’s frustrating because I don’t believe that she trusts me.

I also don’t feel much warmth and love from her. Personally someone can try to help me all they want, but if I don’t feel loved by them, it’s difficult to listen at all. 

In this specific instance, in one session I brought up that I may be having focal seizures, and she agreed with me and even gave me examples.

I started becoming more aware of these symptoms and reported it to the university, because I also felt as though I was having nocturnal grand mals. 

The university then called her, and she told the university that she had no idea. 

Later today I was having a panic attack and made an emergency visit. She basically lectured me on how I shouldn’t be coming up with things and then self diagnosing. It was spoken in such an accusatory way, and it made me feel scared. She never offered any way to sooth my emotions that were everywhere. She was basically just telling me that I was wrong and what I needed to do. She said if I don’t do this, then I’m going to start losing more important people in my life because my heightened emotions will drain them.

Now I feel even crazier before and am questioning my stability more. I feel so insecure and afraid.",09May2019,1
161,"Hey everybody I just wanted to throw out a theory on why our Society is depressed. In fact I can see this in so many people. NOTE: This is not the cause in everybody, there are also other factors like genetics and other things like people were around and things we have been through, etc...

I think its because we are exposed to so many things our body were NOT designed to be around. Our Bodys were not designed to inhale all the sugar, alcohol, screen time, drugs, porn, and all the other shit we do to our body, its no wonder why so many people have so many problems. Think about the more we advance as a society the more depressed we become? Is that a coincidence? Certainly not! You think our body is meant to be working 40+ hours a week... NO.

Now, I get it, bills to pay, kids to look after, all that. But one thing that I am throwing out there, and this is something that I am working on, Is looking to Live off grid/ be Self Sustained. I plan on saving up money for a property, and living off the land.  I see so many things that were exposed to that I know is not bringing us happiness. So many people are always looking for happiness is those things I mentioned earlier. WHY, why do we spend our money on that kind of shit that is not going to bring us happiness long term. Wouldn't you rather have more free time, be around friends and family more?, be out more in nature, etc. Now I know alot of people probably dont have the money to just pack up and do that but its just something to think about.",09May2019,1
162,"It seems like I feel lonely most days, if not everyday. It’s not necessarily the whole day but I definitely feel lonely at some point each day. It usually worsens at bed time and recently I’ve been feeling especially bad about sleeping alone every night even though I haven’t shared a bed with a partner for two years. I guess I really crave and miss the nice feelings associated with having an emotional and physical connection with someone.

I am already on antidepressants, I have friends and people that love me but I can’t shake this feeling.

Is this normal? Is there any way to combat this?",09May2019,11

165,"I find that i hate neuronormatives and nerologically normal and chemically well balanced, largely for their ignorance. 
They like to think that people choose their illnesses or choose who they are and ignore the concept of random chance, because if its all random chance then.. Well that means their normativity was also random chance... That their success in life is also random chance... And that couldnt be, because theyre all perfect infallible beings who are just smarter and generally better than the mentally ill. Besides, only junkies and alcoholics are mentally ill, but its an illness they choose to have, so its their fault anyway, right?
They make me sick. Theyre all so smug and arrogant...
I fucking hate them all...
Depressed or have anxiety? Youre a pussy or an addict.
Schizophrenic? Must be a meth head or a crack head.
Learning disability? Must be a pothead or a junkie.
Its disgusting.",09May2019,1
166,"I am extremely scared. I have been going through crazy anxiety, panic attacks that make my body vibrate like an electric toothbrush, and mental hell for days. To preface I’m 21m, I have experienced depression but never been treated for it, and I have felt my anxiousness ramp up in the past few months. (example: getting in bed and immediately feeling dread about the fact that one day the people I love will pass away, some anxiety when leaving the house, even irrational thoughts like hearing a plane and thinking of it crashing into my house etc) 
But it never felt debilitating or interfered that heavily with my life. Last Saturday I had a panic attack in the car on the way to an event. Since then it feels like shit has kicked into super overdrive. It sucks.

A couple days ago I was experiencing anxiety, not even sure what it was about, and felt a panic attack coming on. My 7yo niece was in the room, playing and being rambunctious. I felt incredibly irritable, then a thought popped in my head. What if I did something terrible to her? Then boom, full panic. Why the fuck would I think of something like that? What the fuck is wrong with me? It continued to spiral. More negative thoughts, often of violent terrible images and against people I love. It’s like my brain was trying to create the worst shit to torture me. And I couldn’t get it to stop. Such a terrible feeling. Told my mom to put away the knives. Thought I was going psycho or schizo or something. I went to the doctor and told him everything including the intrusive thoughts, and he sent me to the ER to be evaluated. Waited a long 7 hours to speak to someone for just a few minutes. I walked out with a “generalized anxiety” paper &amp; prescriptions for Visatril and Lexipro. I tried the visatril and it didn’t do much for me, just made me groggy. Haven’t started the lexipro yet. I did take some CBD last night that seemed to ease the intensity of the thoughts. Took some this morning but didn’t get the same effectiveness as last night.

Since this happened a few days ago, and that first violent intrusive thought happened, they have been persistent for hours everyday. I have not been eating or sleeping much at all. I’ve felt slow, fatigued, and just weird. Feels like a disconnect. When I stand my calves feel tight and body feels like it has the flu.

Today feels especially bad, as this 1 specific intrusive thought that I felt days ago is plaguing me nonstop. Its so scary, it’s like do I actually want to do it? It’s been on my mind since I woke up. Can’t get my brain to move. It seems my compulsion to help with this is to google, as I’ve spent hours and hours googling, reading, and watching videos trying to figure out what’s wrong with me. I don’t even know if it’s harm ocd or something else. I feel like a monster.  

After some reading I’ve tried doing things like trying to accept the thought as just a thought, not a part of me. Or trying to imagine it and the consequences. I can’t shake it. I feel so scared that I may act on it... What’s also really scaring me is all the panic and anxiety that came with the thoughts when they first intruded on me seem to have lessened. I don’t want the thought and it makes me uncomfortable. But it just sits there, persistent. And the fact that there’s less panic there now is making me think I’m ok with it or something.
It feels so scary that I’ve been thinking about taking myself out before I actually do harm the person I love the most. 

I know this was long and prolly confusing but I’m just looking for any type of advice or anything.. I have my first appointment with a therapist on Tuesday. I just have so much fear inside me. If this isn’t ocd what could it be? Anybody experience anything similar? Where 1 thought is just so persistent? Fuck I’m scared.
Thanks for taking the time to read.",09May2019,1
