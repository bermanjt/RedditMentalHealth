0,"In late 2017 I was laid off from a job right around Christmas that paid really well (large company) and was close to home. I was there for just over a year. I was still in college when I started, and was laid off after I graduated. It was a planned RIF because there were new management and a business merger.

From that, I had a really hard time finding a job in the field that I was once working in, especially since I went to school for something more general. Anyways, I had to look for jobs. The time of year was horrible because of the holidays and the winter season. I was getting interviews, but no job offers. After three months of no success, I decided to take a part-time internship with no pay because I needed to do something while looking for a FT job. It overall took me 8 months to *finally* get a FT job offer (I got a few offers). However, the whole process was very difficult for me for a few reasons. The first thing is school - I went to a state school; where I live in people aren't fond of state schools as much since it implies that the people aren't as smart (I live in a county/state that is very wealthy overall). The other thing was that I majored in a broad subject/concentration/field, and I didn't have over 2 years of work experience in the field because I changed my major/career quite late. And the last was that I had a hard time in interviews - some were really good but I made too much, lived too far, or my experience was on the light side. Some interviews were horrible, and the interviewers were very annoyed with my responses or my candidacy in general. A few of them were very bad, and the interviewer even told me I should consider really changing my life trajectory (his exact words) because I'm not meant to be in (X career). That pretty much ended the search in the field I was once working in, since I didn't get anything in 8+ months even after having experience but not a lot. I decided to go into a slightly different field, and had a lot more luck with it and eventually received a job offer.

However, I feel like I've had some severe ""side effects,"" or in other words, I felt I was really impacted by this whole experience. I barely made money for 8 months and suffered a lot financially and had to move back in with my parents. I also suffered some health issues too which drained more money. But, I feel the mental effects have been more severe than initially thought. It's now been over a year since I've got a job, and I have severe anxiety about even thinking about job searching. Unfortunately, the place I work at has high turnover so everyone is always on edge. It makes me extremely anxious/nervous and my stomach always hurts thinking about getting fired/laid off. I tried just like looking at open jobs and I couldn't get myself to even apply to them because I felt distressed, frazzled, and immediately went into a stressed/autopilot mode because it brought back all those emotions and memories about being jobless and not making money for 8 months.

After I got a job last year I was so done and exhausted from job searching that I deleted all my LinkedIn/indeed/zip recruiter accounts so I can stop this period of my life and move to a new chapter. However, it seems these days without these profiles you don't exist for the job market. I recently tried creating a LinkedIn again, and it took me over a month to gain the courage to create it again. When creating my profile, it made me super stressed and lost thinking about things like networking because I feel as if I was like putting myself out there, and I'm not really proud now of my career/schooling choices and being laid off had a huge part of it. Even in my current position, I feel like I don't handle things as well as I did in the past because something is wrong with me. I am trying to work on it because I've never spiraled down the drain like this before. Don't even get me started on interviewing; I'm really afraid of it now. What makes things worse is that I am not 100% sure what I want from my career and I have no motivation to like take classes to improve in the field I'm in now or just like do the things I see a lot of people doing. Thinking of networking freaks me out and I would feel really fake doing it. I probably wouldn't have the courage to go to a networking event. It just has been a huge trickle-down effect and downward spiral. I have also considered changing my career quite a lot lately and going back to school. 

I just feel like even creating a LinkedIn profile, talking about jobs, career, and school, all make me really stressed out and distressed internally I try to avoid it as much as possible. I think there is something not right.",25Aug2019,2

2,"Today I am having a horrible mental health day. My anxiety is eating me alive. I did a horrible job of getting my medications transferred over to new insurance this summer and went 3 days without my anxiety and depression meds. This was a horrible choice. I'm back to where I started. I can't stop shaking, every little thing makes me very angry, and I'm driving my poor husband nuts. He doesn't deserve to have to deal with me like this. I had a full blown episode in the car driving to meet my brother and sister-in-law for lunch today. I crazy cried for 5 minutes because made us late and I had to drive through some foliage. We were late because I took too long doing my makeup. I ended up crying off almost all of my makeup once we made it to our destination. So I did all of that for nothing. That always makes me feel so much better. Heavy sarcasm here.
.
My goal for today was to clean the house because the state it is in is causing me more anxiety. Laundry everywhere, behind on dishes, corgi hair everywhere, trash on the floor, countertops haven't been cleaned, dust everywhere. I just don't know where to even start and it's giving me more anxiety. So I'm choosing to take 30 minutes to get myself together. I took my panic medication and I'm just going to meditate for a bit and tackle this.

Thanks for letting me vent. Just needed to chat with some people who know what it's like.",25Aug2019,5

6,"My son has these, what I can only guess is, facial tics. Sometimes he will blink his eyes, but it's simultaneously followed by a slight head jerk and an audible, but not loud sound. It happens very quickly and he doesn't know that he's doing it.

I took a 20 minute video of him doing it while we sat on the couch watching a movie together. He is 7 years old and has never been evaluated by a a person trained in stimming, tics or autism. He has a bad speech impediment and processes information and speaks at least three to four years behind his age group. Also he is an extremely peculiar eater. If you ask him to try new foods, like a hotdog, he will sit there for 30 minutes crying and sometimes nearly vomits.

He's been in school since was one and a half and has plenty of exposure to other children. He is very sweet and has never shown a shred of violence in his life.

Getting him evaluated is a complicated thing because he lives with his mother. I hope I have provided enough information so that someone here will have a good idea of what he has.

9,"I am currently a 16 year old, my life prior to a few months back all I do is play video games all day to help prevent me thinking about it. Eating is a something I despise doing. Anyways to give some backstory, my whole life I was abused. Some examples are tied up to a chair and soap be put in my eyes and my mouth, go hungry for 2 days a time and yelled at for literally everything. The food I was given was usually leftovers that went bad. Anyways to make a long story short, how do I recover from such a background?",25Aug2019,1
10,"I am a 26 year old that has a very firm diagnosis of schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder, with a plethora of documented traits of other ailments. I am by no means fully recovered and/or in remission, but I am more stable now than I have ever been. It is tough to remind myself of that because I'm still struggling. It has been a long, hard road to get to where I am today and I would like to talk about my journey. 

I had already had BPD symptoms from adolescence onwards (chronic traumas lead me there), but my psychotic symptoms started to poke through in my late teens. I am mostly going to touch on my experience in having a psychotic illness.

As a teen I was showing signs of the prodromal phase, having appeared to have blunted affect, and several negative symptoms most often confused for depression: lack of pleasure, lack of drive &amp; motivation, poor hygiene, etc. When my psychosis had started to hit, the very first thing I experienced just before, were waves of dissociation in the form of derealization. This in turn lead me to develop some odd beliefs and behaviours. (Continued)

My longest running delusion probably lasted about 10 years and at times I fall back into old ways of thinking. I believed this world is just a simulation. It didn't stop there, no, it was a simulation of a simulation spanning infinitely--with no alpha or omega. A cluster of cells within cells within other cells, a strand of a braid of a bigger braid in other braids. I was obsessed with infinity and swore that was God (despite never being particularly religious beforehand). I believed entities were running this simulation and were making my life a living hell every single day. The people within the simulation were mostly NPCs which I called White Noise Nonpeople, as they were just there to fill the space. They all knew me and everything about me, and were in on the entities ploy against me. This is how systematized my main delusional theme had become. 

I would hear voices embedded in the background of the simulation, much like how we used to embed songs into websites back in the day. They would give me keys of information to this simulated universe--while others taunted me for my craziness at times. 

My biggest psychotic break was sometime after I moved out of my parents place, from my hometown to Toronto (Canada). My mother died and months later my father died which lead me to abuse a plethora of drugs. I was already becoming psychotic, but this tipped the iceberg for me. I was abusing everything, especially hallucinogens, stimulants, and cannabis. I was dating a drug dealer from the rave scene I partied in for several years. He abused me, but that is neither here nor there. (Continued)

I had just had a really bad trip days before, then continued to use drugs afterward. I was in and out of the hospital and noncompliant with the medication I was prescribed on and off (chlorpromazine AKA thorazine). They finally decided I should be on depot antipsychotic injections. The day came for me to go to the clinic to get my injection from a nurse, and all I wanted was for her to prove she was real. I had a knife and pulled it out, mumbling to myself I guess. I wanted to see that she bled red to prove she was a living person. 

Needless to say, I had an automatic admission to the hospital. This is where I met my current psychiatrist. I was hiding under a blanket because I thought the radiation from the lights in the hospital was messing with me. My doctor was sweet as pie then, we chatted, but I don't know if I made total sense. I agreed to get the injection. I was in the psychiatric intensive care unit in East York, as I lived in the east end of Toronto then. 

I remember pacing a lot as that part of the ward was very small. I kept refusing the oral meds because I received my first injection right away, only because I didnt know what they were and he never said I was being prescribed it at the time. Eventually things got clearer. I continued to smoke pot when I had day passes. He became my outpatient psychiatrist too. (Continued)

During my stay and even time afterward I had zero thoughts and no internal dialogue. I told him about this while in the hospital, and he asked me an interesting question: ""But how can you talk, then?"" And I explained, ""I don't ever think about what I am saying, speech comes naturally."" 

The thoughts started to return. I would end up in and out of the hospital since then still. He had put me on a community treatment order, which I followed. My stays were mostly because of still being psychotic. 

I watched a certain TV channel all day every day, to the point it was driving me crazy. I saw tidbits of my life being aired on TV, to let me know they were watching me. I thought the news anchor Ken Shaw was involved in all this, so I thought I had to kill him to get it to stop. I didn't want to hurt anyone, so I dragged my own ass to the ER. The police were notified about my beliefs and wete informed of my discharge when I left. I had to speak to detectives sometime after. (Continued)

These are just the most prominent things I can remember, I had a lot of stuff happen in between, before, and after. It's all a blur for most of it though.

I kept ending up in hospital to the point I almost got sent  to a maximum security asylum known as Ontario Shores in Whitby. Luckily for me I improved some, was the longest hospital stay thus far. I spent a third of that year in and out of hospital.

I ended up needing two different depot injections that alternated just to keep me stable and avoiding last resort treatments. My hospital stays have been years apart, but they do still happen. I am stable enough to go back to school, and am doing so. I no longer really hear voices, unless I am in certain environments which cause anxiety levels to rise. My beliefs are just thoughts now, though I know something is up when I start obsessing over them again. I still struggle with negative symptoms, however I am using my support team to help me with this. I am so close to getting on with my life, but I am more stable now than I have ever been. No longer homeless, rarely using any drugs, broke my dependence on cannabis. All that is left to tackle is dealing with the traumas and personality problems, which have undoubtedly added and fed the mix. I hope to become a doctor someday.

Thank you.",25Aug2019,5
11,"Last Christmas, whilst opening presents with family I couldn’t really show emotion of joy with a present. I noticed this more with my birthday just been and I’m really just wondering if it has a term to describe it. 

I did receive everything I had asked for Christmas and my birthday and I still use these things every day, and I was chuffed to get it. However when my mum looked at me after I opened the gift from her, I could only give her a blank stare and say thanks, whilst leaning over to give a light hug. I knew I should show emotion to say thank you more so that’s why I hugged, but with words or with a feeling, I couldn’t do anything, almost sociopathic in a way where I felt like I just used her, but I haven’t yet grown the balls to lie to my mum about feeling, so I did nothing. 

I’m sorry if this is worded weird as English isn’t much a strong point when it comes to putting my ideas into words, but I hope the point is out.

PS: I’ve always felt like I have lied about my own life as I have a strong online presence in certain communities and my life is pretty bland, so could this not knowing true emotion be a consequence??",25Aug2019,1

13,"33M here, I've lived my entire life struggling just to live as normal as possible.  I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and panic disorder when I was 13, a year after I saw my uncles fatal car wreck and then came home one day to find out my grandfather took his own life. Over the years lifes changed many ways I battled alcoholism, struggle with agoraphobia,  and still with the panic disorder and anxiety. My ex wife divorced me last year and still I have strong feelings for her but  I also know its beyond repair. I have zero friends that I hang out with bc I have severe social anxiety I become all akward and wierd. I cant hold  a conversation for the life of me. Which leads into lonliness and that's probably the worst feeling of all, though being on my own may help me some say the lonliness seems to never really go away. Sure i have family around and my kids. I fight everyday to get better and hopefully become more ""normal"". Well I think that's it for now, just felt like I needed to vent.

I still respond to things like a normal person (crying when I'm upset, laughing when I see something I find funny, etc.). I could even be described as emotional as very minor things upset me, but it's like I am completely hallow, and all feeling is physical. I also have frequent thoughts of self harm/harming others. I've had thoughts of breaking my dog's neck, throwing my guinea pig against the wall, stabbing my parents, etc. I wouldn't describe myself as intelligent or charming, but I am manipulative. I do lie about little things, but only small things, like making up a video I saw on youtube or making up a post I saw online. I also lack motivation for things. So, am I a psychopath/sociopath?

I stopped putting effort into my relationship, and my boyfriend is hurting. I can see it. I feel so guilty, and shitty. But I don’t know how to explain it to him. How can I just stop wanting to cuddle, talk to and spend time with the person I love? I don’t even care to sleep in the same bed as him.

A while back an old friend of mine was at a festival, had only a few Bevs, and he dropped. Had a fit then heart stopped and he died in front of me for a small period of time, the paramedics fortunately managed to revive him but before that me and the two others with me thought we had lost him. Seeing a person talk to you to going grey is a bizarre phenomenon. It was as if he had been a month old body on the ground his eyes lost all shine unless you have also witnessed it its almost beyond bounds of possibility to describe.

 Tonight, me and a friend went to town, his girlfriend and also friend of my own was there but they had not been good. Basically the people we were with and the people she was with ended up getting into abit of a crazy argument all stupid crap, and as I watched her walk away with him chasing after, she collapsed. 

Unlike the first experience where I experienced shock and did nothing. It wasn't the same, I shouted to him to turn her to her side and run over, tried communicating but she was lucid, then she had a seizure. Not one but four. Me and the boys obviously stopped giving a fuck about what we were arguing about and did the best we could, we held her head and her jaw to prevent damage to tongue or mouth and check pulse and breath and turned her back and froth from her side between fits to prevent her chocking u till the ambulance got there.

She was alright thank goodness but I'm proud of the dudes rallying round

One, whatever stupid shit your falling out over, ask yourself just how much it matters.
Two, struggles happen to strengthen our souls.

I don’t want to live here or live back at home. I spend 5/7 of my days focused on work. I wake up get ready for work, go to work, get home and go to sleep to be ready for work the next day. On my days off I spend it alone because I have no friends. I am not happy but of course no one knows that. Sometimes i go days without eating.

Is that a mental health problem of in itself? I know I should be happy I am in one of the greatest city ever but what’s the point if there is no one to enjoy it with. I have no support system.

24,"I was watching a youtube channel yesterday called PsychedSubstance. It's this guys who trips and then reports back on his experiences, which were pretty funny to watch. I started off watching a few of his early videos where he was young and his trips were fun, but in a few of them he took drugs with the wrong people. 

I don't mean bad people, i mean people who generally shouldn't take psychedelics. He told this massive story of this girl who was freaking out the whole time.. who got stuck in a loop for 3 days. And then another girl who was one of his fans from the channel and it didn't agree with her on so many levels. Anyway as much as he came across as sympathetic and feeling bad, he was just generally pissed off at the end of the ordeal because this chick just couldn't enjoy it. Later down the track he messages her and asks to give him a reveiw on the experience whether good or bad. All her reply was was the definition of Borderline Personality Disorder. Every after reading it he still made out, well everyome kind of over thinks shit especially when it comes to preparing fot an acid trip yarda yarda yarda.. 

Then a few videos later I come across a video saying ""By far the worst trip of my life."" He describes every aspect of the trip, what he seen, experienced, how he had these underlying issues from his child good he didn't know he had. And he honestly didn't want to have an acid trip ever again. Then his next and last video I watched was him saying the at he'll never trip again, why? Because of the birth of his son. 

Now this whole thing says so much about people who preach about their experiences. It's their experiences..  their own experiences.

Now a bit of my own back story. I'm bipolar type 2 I didn't know this until recently last year at 29 years old. I went through a drug induced psychosis (due to speed) I smoked pot daily. Anyway I smoked pot with this guy in high school almost everyday and he offered me some shrooms, was fun at the start but turned pretty dark at the end of the night. Then later on in my early 20s I try LSD, again at the start was fun but again got scary. Even ecstasy didn't suit me because of its trippy trait.

Anyway I end up going through this drug induced psychosis where instant up for 6 days straight, I wasn't taking speed at the time, I'm talking weeks before this happened. Anyway I go through insane manic episode and thinking during the whole thing this is way more fucking real then any drug could've done to me. 

Anyway fast forward 7 years, I'm diagnosed with bipolar a single mum and I get with this guy who is a big lover of psychedelics, that's his thing. He starts talking about DMT and how he had some, I was lying down on a couch with my head on his lap (totally sober, I don't even smoke pot) with music playing in the back ground and he starts talking to me in a mellow tone almost hyponotizing me the way his talking to me. 

He tells me how DMT can take me to a place where I can finally face all the darkness that holds me back, I can learn what it means to be one and all with everything, you'll be tripling for only 15mins but you'll come back with a life's worth experience..your third eye will opened. I was so zoned in that I was almost in a trance. Anyway I as back to, and I couldn't help but thinking about it.. Like I'm talking almost all the time for days. 

But then I do a little research of my own.. And I see how easily this could put me back into psychosis, how easily I could lose my kids, all for one trip. 

I told him this and he just says ohwell yeah that can happen to some people. 

Going back to the guy who's in the PsychedSubstance videos. He's someone who can really make that experience seem so diserable, to be there in the moment. But only a quick mention of psychedelics aren't for everyone.. when he experienced the worst trip of his life.. he probably never thought back to the trip he had with those people who had bad trips with him that that's probably exactly the kind of shit he experienced. 

It just really says alot about people who preach about how awesome trippy drugs are. Yes setting and mood play a big part, but for some people like myself this shit does not suit me. 

The one thing I feel that gives me a taste, even while on mood stabilizers and antidepressants is meditation.",25Aug2019,1

She wouldn’t speak to me so I turned to the witness that she brought along and before I was even mid sentence she was already on the phone with 911.

The police arrived and I am still dealing with many repercussions from this phone call.",25Aug2019,1
27,"Sorry it’s a long one. 

So I have done what I do for all my assignments and I have kept telling myself I wouldn’t do again. Left a lot till the last minute... I’m scared.  But I have been like this for weeks which is part of this never ending cycle leading to me not getting things done. Well I have been doing work, just not efficiently or spending as much time on it as I should. 

My parents are the kind of people who are always kinda on my case for things but not really as far as asking to see my work. For the past few weeks I’ve been saying yeah it’s fine, I’m on track it will be in on time. When the reality is for this dissertation every internal deadline I have been way behind. If I fail I don’t even know what they would do, they are already mad at the fact I hadn’t gotten a part time job this whole year and I haven’t gotten a job for after. I have been applying but of course they don’t really care until I get something. Oh and they well my mum especially holds grudges like majorly. 

I’m not a perfect student at all but I never really failed anything minus one paper this year (they don’t know about it). But I’m one of those people who had a tutor is basically everything after school and Saturdays. Summer and Easter holidays too. Well the after schools not really in secondary school because I moved to boarding school and being away from them and those tutoring was what I needed. But every holiday I had tutoring. I didn’t get like straight A’s but I did alright in school not terrible but like B ish student equivalent  maybe the fact I got a 4 in chemistry HL for IB still comes up in the “you are useless and give up etc shouted at rants”. I have accepted the fact that chemistry wasn’t for me and that I just didn’t under it be nope. That’s just 1 of many things which come up in rants being shouted at me. Oh and these usually happen at about 11/12 pm just when I am about to go to bed but no I can’t go to bed because I am being shouted at and can’t sleep because I ended mostly in tears. And shouted at because I am crying and I shouldn’t be because I am shit. At this point i think my dad has heard one of these shouting of my mum at me and that was last year. He goes to bed at like 9pm and these happen down stairs. This has been going on for probably at least 7 years every time I am home basically. I go home for holidays mostly.  Academics is just one “issue”, I’ve not exactly been something with a healthy weight since I was about 10 ish. And my mum has made it 100x clear that I am fat and had been restricting food for as long as I remember and giving me side eyes of that’s enough. So snacking when I wasn’t home and out on my own became a thing and Snacking is still an issue. Probably because of that because of her. Especially when I am stressed.. This year she is slightly backed away.. but again not really home especially this year.

So back to my dissertation situation 

First it was the research proposal which was graded, I failed that and had to redo it so that was me already a month behind. Also still with that done no idea what I was doing (still not really which is scary but also I am beyond kinda caring and just in a constant anxiety stress state). 

Then ethic approval before I could email anyone, and  I needed to travel home to interview people for my research. 

People were taking awhile to reply and at this point o the amount of people I needed to interview is like not great but nothing I can do now. 

I have tons of documents which I need to go through and these interviews and I feel like the project topic I chose was WAY  too complicated and has confused me. But I had to stick with it because god know what I would have researched instead. After the resit of the proposal I was kinda having doubts. But also I feel like my supervisor should  have helped and maybe suggested a less complicated project. Or maybe sensed that I was struggling. But also I am at a masters level and I should have asked for help more but. 

I am some one where I don’t know what help I need because there is not one thing which I am struggling with it’s everything. 

Which is probably how I get in this mess and this is the biggest single essay I have ever had to do. Which makes it all 1000x worse. 

I would ask for an extension but I have no real reason except I fucked up. And I probably have mental health issues but I’ve never talked about them or dealt with them since I started undergrad 5 years ago. 

My first year of undergrad was the worst my undergrad experience was not great. I think I may have been depressed or something. I went to boarding school so I thought I would be fine with uni, I was wrong. I definitely spend a lot of time sleeping and discovered Netflix then. I had a roomate and about October so like 2 months into the year she said she would swapping with someone so she moved out and this new person who I never met on my floor moved in. I didn’t really speak to her at all. I think I completed closed myself off from everything basically. I went to most lectures but then spent most of my time in my room. I had no friends basically. Oh and I was in Canada so it was -20 and snow outside for about 6 months a year. 

2nd semester I joined band, that was something which I kept doing till 4th year as something to get me out and doing something. 

Throughout undergrad I never found a group of people I would go for lunch with or do things. I was 100x alone basically. There were people who I like knew and had some lectures with but never hung out with. I’m not a social person and I have never really had that many friend in general. I think that didn’t really help the state in I ended up in and mentally. 

I just remember going on holiday spring break of first year with my mum and I was just so tired and not wanting to go see places in Lisbon. I was not in a good place. But the thing is I don’t think if I were to say then I wasn’t in a good place that my mum would have taken it as anything. 

Even the fact the I am scared of heights she laughs at, and flying to an extent especially turbulence it’s almost under control now.",25Aug2019,1

30,"When I'm alone I talk to myself out loud for so many hours. I tend to have a very distorted view on reality and often am plagued by wishful thinking and a overall cynical worldview. I believe in many things and maybe I'm a person that believes in trivialism. I have a very morbid curiosity. I'm a lonewolf. I often think about death more than life. I believe in all religions and accept them as all true but will critique all of them. I often feel like I'm was born in the wrong reality and that dreams are a better suitor because I'm actually motivated to be in a dream. In life I give no cares only for pleasure . Still don't understand why I still have a job with the type of low effort I use very week. I always plan if I get fired then I'll drive somewhere far away and just drink and rot and just finally got towards the end. I have my infactuatations with many things in which I'll keep private.

31,"I will preface this by saying that for most of my life, ages 8-20, I have been depressed. The last year of my life was very challenging for me emotionally and I hit rock bottom around January. I’ve made some difficult changes in my life over the past few months and I feel better about my life than I have since childhood. What concerns me is even though I’m fairly happy, I’m fairly confident, I’m fairly social, and involved, I’m still suicidal. My thoughts are not quite as active as they used to be, but they’re still present. 

I see the world I’m living in and what the people around me value, and I don’t fit in with it. I’m disappointed with how I have to bend and twist myself to fit in with the values of society. It feels like I’ll never have a chance to live an authentic life.

I also think climate change a lot. I’m watching the world die. It makes me not want to have children because they will inherit a world that is unlivable. Bringing a new person into this feels so selfish. At the same time, I believe my life will be unfulfilling without children.

There are many more issues than these that trouble me, but these are the two I think about the most. Life just feels pretty pointless, despite my relative happiness. I am happy for now, but I predict that my future will be lonely, unfulfilling, and hopeless. So much so that sometimes I want to end everything here, before life gets worse again. 


I’m proud of myself for working to make my current life happier, but my existential dread makes it a bit like taking one step forward and two back. Has anyone else ever felt a similar way? How do/did you cope with these feelings? Thanks in advance.",25Aug2019,1
32,"I keep having these weird violence-related delusions and intrusive thoughts. They aren't extremely bad or compelling at the moment, but I feel like they're getting worse really fast, and I'm afraid in the near future I will act upon them. Some of the things I think/do/daydream about are: 

* Imagine myself randomly attacking a friend or somebody I'm working with (Picking up the pencil I'm holding and stabbing whoever is next to me, randomly sucker punching people I'm running by when jogging, bashing the head of someone sleeping with their head on the desk, etc.) It all feels very real when its happening, and I almost panic thinking I did one of the aforementioned things until I realized it was a daydream.
* Imagine my house getting raided by some nonspecific force of people (Usually cops, sometimes a large group of criminals or military) and me killing every single one in an ambush
* Imagine myself planting a bomb in a very important building (nuclear plant, monument, agency HQ) and then watching people run around and panic with binoculars from a good distance away after i detonated it

Two really common dreams/nightmares ive been having now are:

* Me time travelling back into the wild west with a scoped AR15 and killing entire small towns of people (100 ish). I start by picking people from a distance, but once they all panic and hide inside I get closer and closer from the surrounding hills to kill more. They always get their revolvers or repeaters and try to find me but they're always very confused, uncoordinated and can never stop me
* Me raiding a night time party of Furries around a campfire. They're all in fursuits and I'm in the bushes, and after I kill the first one with a crossbow they all panic, run and scatter but i eventually get them all in the end. (This isn't a joke. I don't even really hate furries, my general attitude toward peoples hobbies is ""if you are having fun and not hurting anyone, IDGAF"" so this dream confuses me)

The weirdest thing to me is there is no mental illness that I feel explains these thoughts. I feel like these thoughts are coming from somewhere else and not originally mine, but at the same time most schizophrenics hear ""The devil"" or just voices in general, but I hear/see nobody. Nobody tells me to do anything and I don't hallucinate. I know im not an expert, but from my own research I dont even fit one of the several symptoms schizophrenics usually have, and I have no family member with a history of mental illness.

It just casually pops into my head and feels completely normal. Like how you might just casually think ""Oh I forgot to take out the trash"" or ""I've got to go to work early tomorrow"" I'll just randomly think ""Oh yeah I should go kill hordes of gov agents."" It doesn't even seem weird until 5-15 minutes after the original thoughts, and im stuck wondering ""Why did I just think that was normal for those minutes?""

I believe in myself, and I wont give up hope that I will reach a weakly goal of 3 pounds *without* starving myself.  I know the road ahead is going to be mentally taxing, but I wont give up.

34,"I wonder why I'm so fuked up in the mind, and altho I know the answer. I always seem to try to ignore it. 

As far as I can remember I've been been exposed to all types of very explicit  things, all relating to sex or violence. There are things I've done as a child and things that have been done to me that I'm very much ashamed of. I was born in 2004, when I was 5-7 years old I was sexualy abused by a man who took care of me and my sister. When I was 5-7, I was too young to understand the full extent of the things being done to me. All I knew was that my parents could never know or I would get in trouble. And and the fact that I thought my dad didn't love me made it worse.  After that I had been sexualy harassed at the age of 9  by a teenager that was the son of my extra curricular teacher. (This lasted 2 years) I also didn't realize how bad it was. To make it worse, I had also done very bad things when I was younger. I showed no remorse for people and even came to abuse animals as a child. I had the urge to dominate something and making it afraid of me. This was probably born due to the verbal abuse I suffered from my sister, my whole life. I had always felt useless and inferior. When I turned 12 I went through teenage depression. Surprisingly though I completely ignored the past events. I believe that my brains way of defending itself from these feeling is by trying to forget about it. It worked until I turned 13 and finally realized what was wrong. Surprisingly tho, now at the age of 14 I am mostly unaffected by these events. I went to therapy but that didn't change how I felt. I had lived giving therapy to myself for so long that I am immune to the pain I once felt.

35,"Okay first of all I want to start of by saying I’m not depressed (I think) anyways so recently I (18F) have not been wanting to eat, and it’s truly because I’m just not hungry or craving anything. I think about what they might be putting in foods, I think about if what I’m eating is truly what I’m eating and I’ve just been so grossed out by everything lately. I take one maybe five bites and I’m already over the food because I just start to overthink. Don’t get me wrong I still eat I know I HAVE to or else I’ll die. But I don’t know. Recently I’ve only been eating 2 meals a day. Maybe this might be the reason why I’m not so hungry anymore because my stomach shrunk? Is that even a thing lol? Another reason, is because of how expensive it is, I know this sounds REALLY dumb but it’s true no matter if you eat out or buy groceries it all adds up. Does anyone else feel like this?

38,"Edit: There might be some triggering things, just so you know.
Last June (the first) my fiancé of five years died suddenly . We had just send out the “save the dates” and invitations to our family and friends for our wedding that was to take place in the fall/winter.
I thought I was over it, as I’ve dealt with multiple traumas from childhood till my early twenties, but I keep seeing him in my dreams.
After he passed, the dreams were kind and uplifting. He told me to move on, so a few months after he died, I tried dating. Of course I wasn’t ready, but I wouldn’t have tried if I hadn’t of had a dream of him telling me to move on.
I made a few huge life changes, like moving back home. Now when I see him in my dreams it sets me back. 
I haven’t looked up a lot of the dream theories, but I’ve heard it’s your brain trying to sort out problems. But why would my brain attack me when I feel like I’m finally doing better for myself?
I’m wondering if this is a subconscious aspect of PTSD.

39,"I (19F) feel very hopeless lately. This post will be very very long. My life for the past year-ish has been confusing and exhausting. A year and a half ago I began my first serious relationship; my boyfriend also had never been in a real, physical relationship so it was new for him as well.
My whole life, I've had problems with controlling my eating habits, emotions, and addictive tendencies. I don't know what it is about me, perhaps lack of self discipline. Anyhow, I've never truly been happy, I've always desired something more. My vices had/have complete power over me and made/make me feel good. But I've always thought, ""when I finally drop the extra weight, and gain control, someone will want to date me, and I will be happy."" 

I met my boyfriend in my last year of highschool, we had a class together and some mutual friends. I wasn't sure at first if he would want to be with me because I was heavy, but surprisingly he did. I figured that, since I finally had someone to love me, I could be happy! I was wrong. I was actually very unhappy the majority of the time, angry, because my boyfriend wasn't being (in my eyes) the ideal boyfriend for me. I started to blame my unhappiness on him even though I was keeping myself in the situation. Fast forward to today, I am not as unrealistic (with my expectations of him) because I have a better understanding of how relationships work now. However, I am still very distressed and unhappy the majority of the time. 

6 mos. ago, my boyfriend revealed to me that he has a fat/feederism fetish. To those who are unfamiliar, it's where the feeder (my boyfriend) gets enjoyment from overfeeding the feedee (me) and watching them gain weight. Even though I halfheartedly agreed to fulfill his fantasy, this was difficult for me as I've struggled with my weight for as long as I can remember. To imagine myself gaining weight on PURPOSE was unthinkable and insane! I wanted to be the most beautiful woman to him though, so I decided to go for it. Part of me enjoyed it when I WANTED to eat, when I was hungry and felt like stuffing myself silly, I didn't mind that he felt aroused by it. Sometimes it felt like a dream, but 80% of the time, I wasnt hungry or I was frustrated because of the money I was losing from buying so much food (I was supporting us), I wasted so much money making myself fatter :( I also felt very upset because his parents were obviously unhappy with how fat I am/was, along with the people around me in my life. He would pressure me to eat and we would often not be intimate when I refused. This was very very very very difficult for me, I felt like I shouldn't have to eat anymore if I feel sick, I shouldn't dread eating because I usually dont enjoy it anymore. I didnt want to make myself sick in order to have sex, or even just to avoid a fight, But I didn't want to say no because I didn't want to not be enough. I didn't want my boyfriend to look around for satisfaction elsewhere. I didnt want him to watch porn and wish that I was more like the actresses.

I know that my opinion is not very popular and I will probably get no sympathy on this point, but my boyfriend and I have also had an ongoing battle regarding pornography. I personally don't believe that it's necessary for people who are in love with someone to use porn. I send my boyfriend pictures and videos of myself, I love sex, plus we live together. The idea of him fantasizing about having sex with another woman breaks my heart. I won't go much further into that because I know how y'all feel, but that's one of my standards. 

Before I knew about the feederism fetish, porn was the #1 issue in my relationship. About 6 months in, I told him that I was uncomfortable with it. He said that he would stop, but I frequently found evidence of usage, which we would fight about. This caused a dynamic of deception, loss of privacy, and sneakiness in our relationship. I finally decided that I was unhappy like this, and ended it. He called me a week after our split and said that he didnt understand why porn was so awful in my eyes but he would do his best to look past it and stop using because he wanted us to be together. I agreed. A couple of months after that, I went on his phone and found a tumblr account dedicated to pornography and feeder sites (at that point I was aware of his fetish). We fought and he promised that it wouldn't happen again. I was especially mad because I had been eating and gaining weight for him (secretly unhappily) and I still wasnt enough. A month after that, I found a private Instagram that he dedicated to following porn/model accounts. This absolutely crushed me, I confronted him and he told me that how I felt about porn was nonsensical and he should be able to do what he wants. I love(d) him so I pretended that I didnt know what he was doing when I was away at work. Eventually I decided that I couldn't do it anymore. I couldn't be a feedee, trying to please him even though it was hurting me, while he couldn't stop watching porn and lying to me. It wasn't fair, I felt like he was the only one who got his needs fulfilled. I eventually tried to break up with him, but he convinced me to stay. He said that he would actually stop watching porn, and he said that I don't HAVE to be a feedee 24/7 anymore. (This was recent)

Even though our major problems are somewhat fixed, I am still so sad. He says that I seem to have depression and bipolar disorder because I suffer from massive mood swings. But I wonder if I'm just suffering from emotional overload? Usually I dont cry every 5 minutes but this past week, even playing difficult videogames makes me break down and cry. I am still asked to eat for my boyfriend, but he's not as forceful as he used to be. And I am in between jobs right now, so it's been rare (these past few weeks) that my boyfriend has been alone at home, but whenever I do have to go somewhere without him, I feel so panicky. I don't know what's going on with me. I don't trust him because everytime he has promised to stop watching porn, it has been a lie. Hes even admitted that he was ""bullshitting"" me in the past when he told me that he would stop and I'd catch him doing it later, and hearing that just makes me feel so uneasy.  He's also justified lying about it, and various other things by saying ""well why would I tell you that I did it? you would just be upset."" that mentality of his makes me so nervous. but he really does seem like he wants to change, and he really does love me, so I want to give it a chance. He is my best friend and I have a bond with him unlike any other. 

I just feel so overwhelmed by the various things that stress me out in my life. If I'm away from home I panick because I think my man is probably looking at other women on the internet, if I'm with my man I'm mildly upset about my current ongoing weight gain (even though it's less rapid now), and I'm scared that he will pressure me into eating and be upset when I say no. I feel hated by his parents, and people around me for being fat. (I live with them) The negative energy is very powerful. I feel bad for always being with my boyfriend and somewhat abandoning my family/friends. I miss the other people in my life who I used to maintain strong bonds with. I feel so stressed wherever I go and whatever I do, there's something that bothers me. It's so bad at this point that I cry out of frustration all the time.
This post is all over the place and I apologize if it doesnt make complete sense, but I feel miserable. Does anyone have any insight or advice for me regarding my happiness?

Tldr: wherever I go, whatever I do, I am stressed out about something. If I'm at home, im worried about my boyfriend and I fighting, If I'm away  I'm worried about him doing things that he said he would not. I miss my family and feel hated by my boyfriend's parents (where I live). I cry very frequently recently. I don't know why I'm so upset? I'm told that I have mood disorders but I'm not sure if that's quite right.",25Aug2019,1
40,"So I'm not gonna put this in the headline thingy, but I've been thinking about killing myself for awhile now, I understand the whole ""if you wanted to do it you wouldn't tell anyone"" argument and I can understand that, but honestly I feel like I need to get this out there and I'm not really sure why I think about it so much. When I really think about it I'm not sure if I would really ever go through it, but its always been a thought/option in my head. Why I think about it so much I don't know. I wouldn't self diagnose myself with anything. As far as I know I should have a relatively happy life. But I can't seem to get happy about anything. Most of my life is spent either at school or on my computer, I have a group of friends who I've talked to for 5+ years and I love them all but I lack any real life connections with people.

I don't notice it, but apparently I have trouble portraying what I'm feeling, and people have commented on it but I don't know how to respond because I really have never noticed it. I also don't really like being around people when I do anything, I for some reason really hate eating around people, I don't actively avoid eating or anything, but there have been times where I just wont eat just to avoid things.

42,"Since the beginning of high school, I’ve never not had a person I’m obsessed with. I’ve changed religions each time. This one’s particularly bad because he expressed interest in the beginning as well, though it’s an impossible thing. 

Anyway. It’s been three years and I’m officially disturbingly obsessed with this man. I’ve done things I’m very ashamed of but desire to do again though won’t because I know I would be in enormous trouble. I also would never forgive myself. I’m disgusted with myself but I feel like I dissociate when I do them. 

I’ve done things like stalking, breaking and entering and cyberstalking. I’ve never been caught. My intent is not at all to threaten or scare but simply to know as much as I can. No one knows about this. I know I need a therapist but in the meantime I need to confess to the internet and seek help here.

I don’t know why exactly I do it because I’m not really seeking a relationship. this man is married and 30 plus years older than me and even though I love him more than anyone I’ve ever met I know a relationship is not possible. I don’t even want a physical relationship. I don’t like sex. 

I don’t know why I feel compelled to get as much information as possible about him. it’s such a strong drive. I feel a little bit like a robot sometimes that is empty and starving for experiences and images and I guess an identity to fill itself up with. Any information about him is fascinating to me while gaps in my knowledge of him drive me insane and frustrate me to no end. 

I spend hours online researching him and his family and friends and discovering tiny tidbits now and then. I have now amassed a huge deal of info about him despite his attempts to stay private online (he uses aliases,etc.). I don’t do anything with this info except try to subtly mold myself into him. It’s very creepy when I write it out. I hate myself so much.

I seem normal to other people but I’m clearly very sick. I’d read his mail if I could....Please help me even just a little. I’m really sorry. 

Anything would help. My mind is broken and I know I need to stop but I don’t believe in god and I have no siblings or family and my mother despises and me and so would everyone else if they knew what she knew. And so this man feels like everything to me. It’s so hard to let go when someone awesome comes along and treats you kindly and believes in you and seems to “get” you.

But now I’m just making excuses. There is no light or goodness in me but my shyness and eagerness to please makes people think I’m a good person. I want to be but it sure doesn’t come naturally. I am obsessed with lying and hiding and obsessing over people it’s truly disgusting.

Further, I feel pressure from those around me to figure these things out. I feel like the pressure sometimes runs to the point that I'd rather isolate myself or give up completely. I do want to figure who I am out, but I don't think I can force it.

 I'm concidering therapy, but I don't know where I'd start if I went. I just feel really silly and little for feeling this way.",25Aug2019,10
47,"While I was there, the therapist told me that there’s a chance that I don’t have depression and anxiety, and that whatever anger and resentment I have is mostly directed towards my parents because they prevented me from discovering who I am growing up. I’m confused when he told me about this because I was so sure I have everything thought out, I thought I knew who I am.  

Growing up, my mom wasn’t there emotionally or mentally. She was there physically and financially but other than that, nothing else. I was bullied relentlessly to the point where I thought that if I was gone, maybe people would live better. My mom used to ignore me whenever I talked because she would say that I complain too much about my work and that I talk too slow. Ever since my visit to the therapist, she hasn’t ignored me or told me to be quiet. But rather, encourage me to talk more about my situations. 

My therapist concluded that I don’t have a sense of self-identity, and that it is probably the main thing that caused me to be this depressed and anxious. I did thought that my lack of identity caused me to be this depressed but I never thought much of it. Thinking back, it explains a lot of things. I have a lot of fears that is preventing me from doing what I love and it, in turn, made me feel so upset with myself to the point that I sometimes don’t see the point in living. I have abandonment issues that gave me severe anxiety whenever anyone doesn’t update me on their situation. It’s not that I meant to be nosy, but it’s because I get scared for the person’s safety if they don’t tell me where they are. 


My therapist scheduled another session for me next week and I feel like this is me trying to take back control in my life. I don’t know what to do with myself now because I’m so lost, but if you have any suggestions on what I can do to find a sense of self in me, can you please suggest some to me? It’s a bit jumbled up, this whole text, but I appreciate any help I can get. Sorry for the long and maybe confusing post.",25Aug2019,18
48,"It happened three times this year. Have not experienced it in my whole life (25,M). First time some sounds coming from a street woke me up, it was dark in my room and for 5-10 seconds I was terrified, fear of something was rushing in my body, I was screaming like crazy, I don't know what I was afraid of, I was just afraid like crazy. After 5-10 seconds I realized where I was and started to calm down. After few weeks, my mom was taking out something from my bedroom, again, sounds woke me up, saw my moms silhouette in the dark room and automatically started screaming and the same feeling of fear was rushing in my veins. After 3-5 seconds I realized it was my mom and slowly calmed down. Today approximately 6:30, I was sleeping in my bed, facing towards windows, there was this extremely loud thunder noise, I woke up and when my eyes opened, instantly saw lighting in the sky with loud banging/thunder noise. Automatically started screaming and fear was coming, but  it was a daylight, I could clearly see my room and in 2 seconds I realized that it was safe and okay. I researched about this issue, people call it ""night terrors"", when you wake up, you are afraid of something and don't know what, but many people have much more extreme experiences.   
When I was 10-11 years old I was coming back from my football class, my mom was working and I had the key of our house. When I inserted the key, it was not turning, because the door was already open. I ran away, called my mom, she came and we together entered in house. It was a mess in the house, everything was upside down. When I saw it I automatically started screaming and I was afraid for one month, I was having thoughts like what if someone enters our house and thoughts like that. I am not scream intentionally when I wake up, it's kind of automatic, my mind is like fuck that, we're screaming like we're murdered and nobody can stop us for 3-5 seconds. Could this robbery moment from my life be the reason why I wake up screaming like that? Should I visit psychologist?",25Aug2019,1
49,"Hi all,

I'm so tired of all this. All I ever seem to do is change my mind. I don't think I've had any sense of certainty in anything I do for ages now. I just can't seem to make my mind up. I will choose something, and absolutely obsess about it for a while, then go and do the complete polar opposite. It's usually things that are pretty defining to your character too, like political alignment. I'll switch from one end to the complete other in a matter of minutes. What?? Have other people done this too? I've made so many different reddit accounts and end up throwing them all away because I'm just not the person I've made out to be online.

I've changed my mind about gender, sexuality, political alignment, philosophical outlooks, mental health, relationships with other people. It's exhausting. I tell people one thing, then go on to change my mind and boom - what I told them isn't true any more.

It's like I just have no sense of self. I feel lost.

I will constantly fluctuate between states of happiness and depression. I saw a doctor about my anxiety and depression, who suggested that I was, in fact demonstrating indicators of both conditions, but then - before my first appointment - I completely change my mind about the situation. No unhealthy levels of anxiety, and no depression. I feel like I'm faking it all. This doesn't make sense, those sort of things don't just go away overnight, so I must be faking it.

I have a turbulent relationship with my parents, going between loving them immensely, to hating them. I don't like that at all. They've given me so much, and they deserve all the love in the world.

I've read up online about all this stuff, and borderline personality disorder comes up. Naturally, I'm tentative to take a Google diagnosis, because that's just immature, but I can't help relating a bit. I have convinced myself in the past that I do have certain mental illnesses, which is so stupid. Maybe I'm just a selfish person. Maybe I'm an attention seeker. Regardless, with BPD, I'm unsure because I've had a fine life. This is what leads me to believe that I'm just a selfish person who's making all this stuff up for attention.

I just want to be a normal person, live a normal life and be happy. If I don't know who I really am, I think I could have some trouble with that.

What should I do, internet stranger? Is this just normal? Should I just grow up?",25Aug2019,10
50,"Hi, sometimes I don't know I am just a case of ""1st world problems"" or if I have mental issues because I don't know what ""normal"" people feel like (I know no one does).  I'm a 31yo woman, after I finished uni I spent 5 years cut away from people just sitting at home. Only a year ago I got a job and regained a ""normal"" life. I have a job in online customer support which I fucking love because I get to solve little technical problems and don't have to think about myself. As long as I'm before or at work I'm fine. It's the days off that I get pangs of regret over the lost 5 years and fear of loneliness for the future. I have a constant a knot in my stomach on my days off, I wish I could work 7 days a week.

I've never had a boyfriend or had sex (well once almost when I was 24, I tried to force myself but it felt awkward). I have never kissed anyone sober and honestly I have not felt pleasure from kissing. I've had plenty of attention, my looks are not the issue. I'm straight, since I started my new job I've had 2 crushes on coworkers (both taken). I'm not asexual I think, (I fantasize and masturbate), I just find all this so hard to do.

I remember having a proper period of  depression at 13 because I clearly remember not feeling anything. I remember wishing to even feel sadness or any negative emotion as it would have been better than literally nothing. Now I just feel more anxious as I feel my time is running out. 

Short backstory: My parents had me late. They got together because whey were getting old and there was no one else left. My mother has been depressed my whole life, a recluse who withdraws as a coping mechanism (she had 2 mental breakdowns when I was a teen where she would disappear somewhere for hours, then come back and hide in the closet. She went on early retirement which was bad for her I think). My father is on the autistic side I presume. He has been obsessive about money my whole life to the point of dripping water overnight into a bucket so that water meters don't register it. This might sound trivial but it broke my family. It triggered my mom's breakdowns which triggered my depression. Also I was competing for resources with my sister (haven't spoken to her in 15 years). People have always laughed at my dad or teased him. He was a weirdo. He was also absent when I was 1-4 years old because he worked abroad so this might have made me not bond with people. 

I never worked any of that through with my parents and now It's too late as they are old and sickly and I'm sure not going to make they more depressed in their old age than they already are. My father wouldn't have the mental capabilities to process such info anyway and my mom would cry and maybe worse. 

I just don't know if I'm actually mentally ill or if I'm projecting my parents onto me.",25Aug2019,8
51,"I had a mental breakdown this past hour. It was very strange because I have been quite happy for the past couple of months. It just kind of struck out of nowhere. I was laying in the dark on my bed and it just felt like negative thoughts were being blown up in my mind. I tried meditating, watching videos to distract myself, and I finally google searched a chatroom for anxiety and that actually helped. Just talking about it. I feel a lot better than I did 30 minutes ago. I feel really bad because my significant other gave me a call and I told her my mind was going negative. I feel like I should've just kept it to myself and stayed strong. I'm still having a bit trouble falling asleep. Any tips for calming the mind?",25Aug2019,1
52,"I’m in this weird middle ground where I hate showing any kind of sadness or talk about how I feel about things because I know I’ll put a burden on them. The closest I get to opening up is throwing jokes around. But I will gladly be happy with people, I’m usually known as the sunshine of the group. As far as I know emotionally closed off is not showing any emotion so what am i?

55,"Hi all 

I have very basic knowledge of mental health conditions , and have become extremely  interested in the topic, and am looking to learn a lot more. My very limited research into the topic has opened my eyes greatly to the various conditons, and want to learn more about the causes, effects and treatment options for these conditions (eg Psychosis, Bipolar, Schitzophrenia etc etc ). , as well as hearing first hand accounts  / interviews from people living with these disorders.

Of course my knowledge is only limited, and I'm not really interested in the science of the brain etc,more the real world effects. 

So any recommendations for books or documentaries to read / watch would be greatly appreciated.",25Aug2019,1
56,"So after a good 6 months after having the realisation that I'm emotionally messed up(have a hard time acknowledging/processing emotions) and have attachment issues; I decided i dont wanna live the rest of my life numb, detached and with this sense of emptiness. But I also feel helpless cuz I don't know where to start, I know a lot of my problems stem from my childhood but I dont know how to process it. I'll have this immense moments of sadness (sobbing/shaking) over it, I feel stuck. 

And so I decided I need help, professional help. And I booked a time at the psychologist.. its tomorrow and I'm feeling really anxious about how it will go. I can barely talk about it with friends without becoming tungtied and teary eyed.

I have no clue how it will look, and if I even need the help I think I do. I have this stupid notion in my head that if youre not depressed or have a clearvmental disorder they'll wonder what the hell I'm doing there. I live in a country with subsidised healthcare system which is the only thing I can afford (private therapy would cost up to 200$ per session, while the state subsided ones are just 10$).

I'm scared they'll go 'yeah you're not messed up enough to get public healthcare'",25Aug2019,3
57,"Long-story short: two years ago my wife (26f) became very ill while I was away on a business trip. It corresponded in time to a medication change for her epilepsy. We had never experienced any form of mental illness and a lot of mistakes were made in not understanding that she was manic, had stopped eating, and had stopped sleeping. It took a month for her to completely unravel and she began having illogical thoughts, paranoia, and psychosis (e.g. a person she saw outside our apartment is a terrorist). We were never quite sure if she had hallucinated anything or if she was just attributing ideas to things she was actually seeing. She went into a mental health hospital for ~32 days before she was released taking Abilify and temporarily Restoril to make sure she was sleeping. The doctors told us that they do not generally give a diagnosis on the first time something like this happened, but their thoughts were medication-induced psychosis that may or may not be permanent. The first couple months after she came home were rough but after a year on the Abilify, everything seemed to almost be completely back to normal. Her out-patient psychiatrist took her off of Abilify slowly and everything was fine for a year.

I took another business trip last Saturday, Aug 17th. Things seemed okay for the first couple days when I talked to her over FaceTime but with the 6 hr time difference, we were only talking for ~30 minutes a day and she never showed any signs of texts during the rest of the day. On Friday Aug 23rd (her birthday), she was texting me erratically. I had our friend come by in order to help make sure she was eating and was okay. I realized over FaceTime that night that she had been covering up symptoms for our calls but that by Friday they were breaking through because she was so upset about me being gone. I made it home at ~8PM yesterday and things were worse than I expected. She has lost about 5 pounds in a week and is refusing to eat pretty much anything. She says she is starving but doesn’t want to make a food mistake. I know from when she got out of the hospital two years ago that she isn’t handling choices well because they all produce anxiety for her and she simply worries that she will make the wrong choice. Even if the choice is made for her now, she is still refusing.

Her former out-patient psychiatrist and psychologist work at the same office which is closed until Monday. She was seeing a new psychologist in the same office because of anxiety around driving, which obviously is orders of magnitude less of a problem than what we are having now. I called their crisis number and was told what to do if things escalated but that my best bet was calling for an emergency appointment on Monday morning.
From when she was in the hospital before, they had given her Restoril to sleep for the first week weeks after she was discharged. To try to force her to sleep, I gave her a Klonopin, which is her emergency seizure medication. She agreed to take it but it took some convincing. To complicate this further, her not sleeping may at least be partially related to a terrible cough she has at the moment. I didn’t realize how bad it was until we laid down and she coughed like crazy for 2 hours, while she should be passed out from the Klonopin… To get her to sleep at all, I knew she would have to take cough medicine but she was refusing (even a cough drop). After another hour of her refusing to take the cough medicine, I physically forced her mouth open and poured the cough syrup down her throat. I feel like a monster. I don’t know if I can do that again but today I have to get her to eat. 


How do I get her to eat until then that doesn’t require me physically forcing things into her mouth?",25Aug2019,1

Is still not helping and I want him to help with not doing stuff like he used to anymore or actually listening to things when I list what triggers me.

Like idk if I'm just overreacting in all this but like. He helped fucked me up as bad as I am today. I don't want to loose my family. I don't want to loose the love of my life. I don't know what to do. It all started about 7 years ago when my relationship that never really had an issues till the very end ended with us.

So last Saturday during just a regular conversation in the library, I have managed (accidentally) to get her to open up about her condition after I talk about the things I went through last year. It is kind of obvious on her physical appearance that she is dealing something terrible. her FB profile is filled with images of a satanic influence and disturbing post she made which is kind of unusual for people and culture in my place with limited access to foreign stuff, and basically one of the reason that convinced me that she need help. So, is there any way that I could help her or even support her?",25Aug2019,2
60,"I dont where i can post this so it being put here. Cause it need to come out. And i have no i can talk i have no support group. I cant form realonships to save my fucking. At this point. Soon that gonna become a fucking reality. 

So i decided to leave home againg at the start of summer. When to a new city. Got a job got a place. Fuck i just upgraded jobs. I when from a store making 12 a hour to a hotel making 16. And to top it off, it my boss who at the store who got me the job. My interview wasent eveing a interview. It was ""this is what have open witch possition you want.""

But guess who relapsing today for work. Witch is something ive never done in my life. But like i cant half passing out at work eather.

So why is this happing? Well after 3 month i have no friends. That nothing new happend last 5 times i left home to go to alberta and bc. The exacle same thing happend. Witch resulting in me quit my good paying jobs. Screwing over alot of people i work with. Cause after 8 to 9 alone unless im at work. Best part im more extroverted then introverted.

I heat it. I dont know what to fucking do anymore. Im told to go out so i do. To sit at the bar table alone. After a hour or 2 im leaving cause im alone whit my thought in a socail situation and probably drinking alcohol. So i leave, i go busking and jam seasion. Have hey how it going, then they fuck off to their actually group. Cause you know there not actually their with me. But they still want to be friendally since im the one who came up to them and said hi. I try going to bars and yeah i dont do that no mors. Cause socail anxiety at least i thing ive never been dignosed. I always thought i was just shy. But last year someone mention they thought i had socail anxiety. Im like im just shy. And appreally that surprise him.
And tell me im anything but shy. Witch is kinda true. So I finally endup spending all my time in my room. Alone no one to talk to. It at the point work my favorite part of my life. Ill fell like on my days off im just patentally waiting to go back to work. Cause at least their i cam have small talk with people. And im too busy to thing about all the other aspects of my life.

But the hole start convo thing im starting to get away from. Cause obousally im start to overload with all this shit. It pretty hard to have convo where that darkness dosent come out some way or form. And people pick up on that. Amd of crouse when u tell people u been here for 2 to 3 month amd made 0 friend. No one gonna say your a great guy. Good guys dont fucking have no friends. That just how it is. So maybe im just a good for nothing peace of shit. Idk.

All i know is i was ""fine"" till a girl at work starting ask me about my realonship life. The Love side of it. I useally avoid that question like it the fucking plage. Ive been single for over 7 years. Yeah u go tell a girl who seem kinda interested you been single for 7 year see if she still intersted in you as much. And stick around

It didn't help me at all, for whatever reason any woman I approached or asked out just wasn't interested. And I basically thought what's the point and stopped looking after myself and recently hit my heaviest weight. I just can't find the motivation to try and get rid of it anymore. I just feel lonely.

Mostly I'm struggling with the loss of a friend group. Long story short -- hung out with these people for 8 months about a year ago. Felt like family. Really developed a close bond with several people all at once, some more than others. Then they all just stopped talking to me after I caused some drama because I'm an idiot. I tried to salvage things but it was too little too late.

The other day I thought I saw one of them outside a store and literally whipped my car around in a u-turn to drive back by and see if it was them. It wasn't. Why the hell did I do that? I tried not to make the u-turn but I couldn't focus on the road once I caught that glimpse.

Why can't I get past this? Closure is not an option. Talking to them is out of the question. I have dreams about them all the time too.

And she flipped out and we went to the hospital (where the doctor didn’t listen to me and kept on saying how my arm was numb &lt;which it wasn’t&gt;) and they said it was regular for children to have irregular heart beats???? (I’m 13 btw so still a baby) 

So my mom was like “it’s totally anxiety”. But I don’t think she understands what anxiety is bc she’s talking about how we have to talk about distressing bc my class makes me angry with their rudeness and disrespect. But like that’s not the only thing...

1. I fret going to school everyday bc it’s scary there
2. I physically avoid some areas so the kids there don’t look at me
3. I constantly feel like I’m the topic of people’s conversations and not in a good way
4. The hecking climate crisis is making me lose sleep
5. Stressed from the pressure of keeping good grades
6. Girl keeps on getting on my nerves
7. Cant focus much in class anymore
8. Tight chest, hot/cold flushes, sweating all the time, LOTS OF WATER, picking at finger nails etc etc
9. Am lesbian. Homophobic dad. Never gonna come out bc I don’t want to hecking die
10. Everything feels like the end of the world

So there’s plenty more reasons why I think I have anxiety (but not in the “ I’m 13 and I totally have anxiety it’s so cute aha” way) and when I was telling my good friends about some of this (who may I add have diagnosed anxiety) they said that I probably do and should get some help.

But the thing is I don’t want to talk to many people about it bc it’s scary and Adjoenishia

And my mom said she doesn’t want me to go on medication for anxiety but I really do (bc it sounds  good to like take a pill or smth and then feel better) and idk how to tell my mother all of these things that I’m feeling so yeah 

Also she probably won’t believe me bc I have a confident “I love myself” demeanour. But it’s a hecking facade so then people don’t judge me idk why I do it it makes no sense now that I’m saying all of this.",25Aug2019,0
72,"  Please, if anyone here consulted a therapist and successfully overcame this self-destructive state of mind, share your experiense with me. 
  I've been dealing with BDD since I turned 14. I'm 18 now, graduated high school this year, aced the exams and am going to university in couple of weeks, in completely new city filled with people I do not know. I need to study well, build my career, work for my future...
  I'm terrified. I'm still unstable. There are days or weeks when I'm disgusted by my body, but most importantly - my face. I hate it. I hate how big, asymmetrical and grotesque it is, or seems to me. I can't look in the mirror or see a photo of me without a panic attack and sudden urge to hurt or kill myself. I want to disappear. When those feelings kick in I completely isolate myself from everyone. Especially from people I love and care about, because I know I'll WANT TO talk about how ugly and disgusting I am and at this point they must be fed up with it. So I just don't contact them for a while and end up feeling even worse. 
  The most terrible part about it is that I hadn't had such days/weeks for 2 months. I was feeling my best, living my life fully, but 2 weeks ago I felt that crippling anxiety and body dysmorphic thoughts again and I've never felt more helpless. 'Here we go again'. I lost interest in everything and everyone, again. And now that I've felt how great it is living without constant depressiom/BD in the back of my mind, I don't want to go back to the same toxic patterns I've been following for these 4 years of my life, especially now, when a huge change is coming my way.",25Aug2019,2

I started having mental issues since the day I suddenly remembered sexual abuse from a sibling. Since then I've done my best to keep it a secret for the legal safety of the family member and fear of being locked in a physiatric ward for thinking about suicide daily. 

In my pursuit of avoiding and trying to escape my ""depression,"" I learned a lot of musical instruments, read many books, beaten many video games and so on. But as I age these problems have been getting worsened. My mother is getting me with a psychiatrist soon so I can hopefully get some meds to remove myself from my mental anguish. But I'm just very anxious about seeing them. I've always been an introverted person and I'm just really scared about what they're going to tell me, or if they're going to send me somewhere. I'm still in highschool. I'm a great student. Half my classes are college level and in accordance with the local community college. I've never attempted suicide or self harmed, but I'm really nervous as to what my fate will turn out to be, and I'm looking for any sort of advice I can. I am unable to communicate to my male collegues about my issues for fear they'll just call me a ""pussy"" and so on. But I'm looking for some sort of advice. I told my mother about the sexual abuse and I never thought I'd do that in a million years but I did, and now life seems to be unreal for me.

78,"I'm dealing with a heck of a conundrum. I have a friend that is staying with me for the past 2 months or so. He had fallen on hard times and so I opened my house to him to help him get a leg up. Everything seemed ok. It was nice to have an extra pair of hands around my house. We had agreed on a fair rent and he quickly got a job and was paying it and getting his own groceries. 

Then one day he got fired for 2 days no call/no show. I was none the wiser at the time, because he told me they had changed his schedule and he had those days off. Then his manager (another friend of his) showed up at my house to get the keys for work from him and told me what happened. 

My wife flipped out and went to her parents. Her parents (they help us out a lot with money on my wife's behalf) basically gave me an ultimatum that he had to leave. Both my wife and I have reached out our friends to try to find another place for him to stay. Unfortunately, we turned up empty handed. 

My friend in the meantime, has done nothing in the past while to find a job or a place. He gave me a pity talk about this is going to be the last time I see him and I was his last chance. He has family, but for some reason he won't reach out to them.

I noticed some weird stuff like he has a phone that the sim got deactivated, and I offered to help him get a new one but he refused. His car needs to be updated on the registration, but he won't do it and therefore won't drive very far because he doesn't want to be pulled over. My wife was also concerned he was hearing voices (he told me a long time ago he was diagnosed scitzoaffective disorder). I confronted him about if he was hearing voices and he insisted he was just talking on his phone to his girlfriend and that he was having arguments with her friends on the other line (she seems to be the only one he talks to via wifi on his phone).

I reached out to the one family member I had contact info for, and she referred me to his older sister. I brought her up to my friend, and he immediately said he refused to talk to her. I decided to call her myself and she said his whole family was worried about him. I explained what was going on and she was willing to take him in. She said he would probably be really angry about it, so she was thinking I shoud trick him and drive him over to her house without telling him where we were going.

I only have like a day to resolve this myself. I have to leave on business soon, and he's supposed to be moved out on the friday while I'm gone. Does anyone have any advice?",25Aug2019,2

80,My life is going in the way that sadly many people lives have ended up like. I lost my dad early and my mom turned into an alcoholic and has harassed me my whole life. I need help on how to help myself and my mother so I can stop being depressed. I'm in my early teens so I still have some time to put my life on the right tracks. I'd love to be able to PM someone and just talk about my situation or just get any help.,25Aug2019,1
81,"Hello all. First of all, sorry if this ends up being a very long text. I'm still having trouble wording all of this together in my head.

There's something I've been going through for long periods of my life that I had never really felt the need to put a name or tag to, I figured it was just something that happened to me. However, upon Googling my symptoms (I know, eye roll) I realize it might be something serious.

I frequently feel myself distanced from reality. Not in the literal sense as I'm still fully aware of what's going on and can still interact and fulfill my duties normally, but I do feel like I'm just an observer. I have these episodes in which my vision gets kinda tunneled and blurry, and I can only focus on one thing. For example, I can be talking to a friend normally but it doesn't even feel like I'm the one talking. I can see their reaction and sort of feel my lips moving, but it doesn't feel like I'm there. Alongside this, while still aware of my surroundings, I feel more uninhibited to stimuli. Kind of of like when you're drunk and stumble on a lot of things while walking upstairs, but not with the loss of ""intelligence"" (so to speak) that comes with being drunk. I am still mentally 100% functional and can perform tasks like drive or participate in class.

I really think self-diagnosing is offensive to people who are actually going through mental illness, but I believe I have symptoms of clinical depression and anxiety disorder. I'm gonna try to sum up what I believe are the causes as much as I can. The root of my mental problems is my relationship with my parents. I am a 21-year old gay male and I've had numerous run-ins with my folks because of this. Ever since they found me watching a very particular kind of porn on the family computer since I was 12, it's all been hell. Just an environment of mistrust, constant hovering, and mental abuse that has caused me to become very socially anxious and paranoid. They would go through my phone, ask me to take pictures of my friends so they knew who I was with when I went out (so I wouldn't like run off and hook up with a guy, I guess?), and many, many, other things.

I have gone to therapy, though. My parents took me, although in hopes that I could revert to straight or whatever. And while this has been helpful for my mental health, they always stop taking me after the therapist tells them my sexuality is natural and not much can be done about it. As such, I have never been able to discuss my disassociation with reality with a professional.

I really don't know when it all started, but I remember it was way worse in high school. I wouldn't be able to focus in class, and the tunneled vision I mentioned earlier was more like a bright tunnel. Kind of like a very light aura. I really can't recall how long I went through that or what I did to make it go away (if it ever did...). I believe I have had some episodes occurring since then and now, but they've been minor. Cause it's bad right now. I'm feeling that way every day, all day. To a lesser extent than when I was in high school, but it's constant now.

What worries me is that I'm doing a year abroad next month. I'll be living on my own a ten-hour flight away from home. I'm not scared I won't be able to take care of myself; I'm still functional while dissociating. I'm frightened by the idea I won't be able to enjoy the freedom I've been longing for over nine years for. I'm worried I'll be on autopilot the whole time and before I even notice it I'll be back home on the same environment that caused me to dissociate, and the memories of me enjoying living on my own will quickly fleet away. Time does happen faster when I'm dissociating...

That's another minor thing. Memories are always very distant to me. I can remember them but hardly ever picture them. I know what happened but I can't ""play the video"" in my head. It just looks black. This is a very minor irrelevant thing, but something I've also noticed happens to me.

I believe this dissociation came to be as a defense mechanism. A way for my mind to escape the constant tormenting at home. But I really want to turn it off. I get to actually escape the toxic environment that has hurt me. I need to really be there. I know I need professional help, but with all the expenses from the study abroad program, we're not really in a position to splurge on that. Furthermore, I'm leaving in a month. There may not be enough time for a thorough analysis and diagnosis by a professional. Although, as I write this, it comes to mind that, hopefully, upon escaping this environment, it'll go away on its own.

If you've made it this far, thank you very much for reading. I really don't know what response I expect to obtain from this post. Maybe I just wanted to flush the thoughts on my head. In any case, any advise is more than welcome. Thanks again, everybody.

P.S.: I don't know if I'd like to ask for local services, but if it helps: I live in Monterrey, Mexico and I'm moving to Munich, Germany in about a month.",25Aug2019,1
82,"I (22F) get angry easily. I really hate the place where I live (with my family) and I hate my relatives too much. I stuck in my home for years, I even don't have a friend (also I don't want a friend). I'm not asocial or shy, I just don't want them because they're like burdens.

I hate babies, old and ignorant people. I hate it when someone kidding me or complains about me or don't agree with me. My mood changes easily, like every 15-20 minutes?..

I'm even just easily pissed at the sound of the eating. Always, I can not focus on my work.

Can't go therapy because I'm afraid of ruin my career. I'm very kind to that people who I don't know about, that means I have a mask for everyone. Also, I'm sure that if I go to therapy, I won't be diagnosed because of my masks.

85,"Hi everyone.  
I've been taking some sort of therapy for most of my childhood/teen years (from both goverment facilated and private services) along with psychiatric treatment for general depressive/self-harm tendencies. Frankly it's been an inconsistent process,with me not being able to stick to one therapist either because of the feeling of making no progress or monetary problems.However my longest relationship with a therapist had lasted for 3 years (albeit with inconsistent visits).  


I never felt truly satisfied,simply haven't had the power to execute any of the steps i should actually take long term to improve my state and the most i got from a session was the temporary sense of relief.This solely wouldn't be an issue, I do like having sessions and relieving myself,connecting with someone if only for a moment. However, over the years, increasing cost of both decent therapy and psychiatry services have strained my budget and bolstered my questioning of the sum/cost value of it all. Presence of the mental health industrial complex had always made me uneasy, money being the crux of decent professional help, but this is becoming a burden and discouraging me even further.

87,"Hello. I have posted something like this before but I didn’t get much response, so I’ve decided to do it again. 

I have recently turned 16 Years old, and I am about to enter college (from the UK) and I have been suffering mentally since I was around the age of 12 Years old. 

I was diagnosed with mild anxiety and depression when I was 13 Years old, and I also had Scoliosis, which I had surgery for last December which was successful. 

I am still in recovery from the surgery. Around 2 years ago I was due to have the surgery around August 2017 but the surgeon refused to do so because of my mental state at the time. 

I felt like over the past year I was getting better. I thought in 2018 I peaked and was finally getting better. I was going out and socialising with other people. I made a lot more friends and even had the confidence to go back into a main-stream school as I used to go to a hospital school which helped people who suffer with mental and physical problems. 

But after my surgery, I felt like I’ve started becoming downhill again. Me and my Dad went to our local GP and I’m currently waiting for some more help but because what I’m going through isn’t seen as urgent I’m not getting help quick. I have college in less than 2 Weeks, and I’m terrified to go in my mental state. 

I am having a lot of thoughts questioning my own interests and me as a person. My brain tells me that whenever I have an interest that I ‘don’t actually like it’, or I am ‘doing things to fit in’ when deep-down I know that is bullshit. Does that make any sense? It’s almost like I fear being one of them people who do stuff like that, and it is costing me a lot. 

I know that these thoughts are not real because I feel like normally if you generally dislike something you wouldn’t be questioning anything. You would be like ‘oh, that’s right, I don’t like this thing, I will stop doing that now’ and then continue on with your day. But for me I’m completely attached to these things, and the reason is because these things has helped me through rough times and generally make me feel happy, but whenever I feel happiness my mind is suddenly clouded with negativity. 

I also completely avoid things I used to like because it reminds me of someone I lost which I absolutely hate about myself and I wish I could control doing. I remember dates before and after I thought that way if that made sense like I would be scrolling through photos and see an old photo and my brain would just go ‘that was when you felt genuine happiness towards this thing and now you avoid it’. 

I feel like I’m going insane honestly. Does anyone else relate to this and have any tips to get over these types of things? I would really appreciate it seeing as I doubt I’ll be seeking any medical help because I attend college. Thank you for anyone who does give advice. I deeply appreciate it.",25Aug2019,1
88,"This is just a throwaway account for privacy reasons and all, but yeah. I don't think I can afford therapy. Where I live, therapy is really expensive (where isn't it?) and the cheapest options on sliding scale prices are usually $140 - $150, and I definitely wouldn't be put there, as almost every therapist states on their website that price is a sliding scale based on income. Income is high enough, but I have a medical condition that is exceptionally expensive and am paying for college (online until I can afford to go to campus), so I don't really have the money to pay $190 - $200 dollars per 50 minute session for an indefinite number of sessions. I've looked at somewhere between 50 and 60 therapists in my area and have found 5 who accept my insurance - none of whom meet my needs.

90,"Hey guys,

I am feeling kind of ridiculous for even posting this, but I am freaking out atm.

So me and my family live in this single-family-house in the center of my block, which consist of one-family-houses. 

There is this family, which we rerely ever talk with for some reason (my parents don't seem to like them cause they are obnoxious, load and snobby). But they also don't seem to like us very much either. They have by far the most expensive house in the block and they are overall pretty snobby, I would say. They seem very ambitious, in particular the mother of the family. She owns at least one company. They also bought at least on other property on the block and also seem to know everybody important and make a big deal about it.

So yesterday, I ripped a single bong hit and I was pretty high from it. I laid down with open windows. They seem to have guests over, were sitting in the garden and they were talking pretty loud so I could make out some stuff they were saying. Here are the most severe stuff (I think) I heard:

* The father encouraging their daughter to sleep with some guy and to text him
* The daughter asking if &lt;someone&gt; is dangerous and the father saying that he would love to see that &lt;my haircolor&gt; guy try something. Making gun sounds or punching sounds afterwards
* The father saying putting something in someones drinking water leaving that someone crippled.

So what I came up with is, that they aspire to own a bigger part of the block including the property they already bought, the property of an old lady (who will not live very long prolly) which they also keep close tabs with and our property at some point. But they know that my family will never sell, so they will wait until I own the house (which I will) and then somehow eliminate me or make me sell it to them. I also think they laced our drinking water with lead or some shit for a long time now, to make me a docile little dummy.

I started avoiding drinking the tab water to see if i feel any different and thinking about testing it for traces of lead.

For what I understand either I am crazy or my neighbors have a conspiracy against me and my family.",25Aug2019,2
91,"Note that I have had no contact with her for over 18 years but my siblings continued contact with her. 

My mother physically, psychologically, and emotionally abused my siblings and I throughout our lives with the psychological and emotional abuse continuing until I ceased contact with her. She abused us all but I guess I had a lower tolerance than my siblings so I ceased all contact years ago while they continued to see her to varying degrees.

I didn’t feel malice towards her so I didn’t hope for bad things to happen to her. I simply removed myself from her because that was the best thing to do for my own psychological well-being. 

She died yesterday. I feel a bit weird. No sadness. Just a bit of unknown oddness knowing that she is gone. I’m not sure what I expected to feel. I think maybe I thought that I would feel relief or feel nothing.

Yes, I am going to the funeral (it is a couple of thousand miles from me). I am doing that out of respect for my siblings and her parents (my grandparents were wonderful to me).

93,"I've never really shared my entire experiences of mental health with anybody - I've always been too scared to fully open up to people I know, so I feel more comfortable doing it here. I'm writing this post for myself - to remember what I've achieved, and give me motivation for the future - and for others who may relate to some of my (many) situations. For context, I'm 21, male, from Manchester England. 

This post is about my anxiety issues - I also tend to suffer from on/off depression but that was at its worst in winter 2017. 

I first experienced anxiety when I was in high school (UK), around 14/15 years old. It is perhaps one of the most 'unique' anxiety disorders, I think it's referred to as toilet phobia (and to clarify, this is about weeing). I remember the first time vividly. I was sit in an assembly, for some reason it was held in the sports hall, and a random thought came into my head: 

'What if I needed the toilet right now? I wouldn't be able to do anything because I am way too awkward to interrupt an assembly'. 

All of a sudden, I was bursting for the toilet. I was on the verge of wetting myself and having multiple panic attacks, I was a 15 year old about to wet myself in front of all my friends, classmates and teachers. Somehow I survive, the assembly ends, I sprint to the toilet...and nothing comes out. I was bewildered. And this same thing kept happening in every assembly, every exam I sat, every time there was no easy access to the toilet. It was seriously torture. I missed school trips because of this, I missed going to the theatre with my English class. Assemblies were straight after lunch, so I would spend every lunchtime inside the bathroom, holding in a genuine wee, making sure I didn't relieve myself until the very last second, in the hope I'd feel okay during assembly. It sometimes helped, but not all the time. I ended up faking illness to get out of going to assembly. 

Even during the school holidays, if my friends invited me out to the park, I would hold in a genuine wee and make sure not to relieve myself until the second before I left my house. Sometimes I felt too anxious to wee, even when my bladder was full, so I'd cancel plans. 

I wish I could pinpoint the exact moment I overcame this anxiety - sometime in between finishing high school and starting sixth form college - but I did overcome it, all by myself, and that is one of the proudest moments of my life. 

During my second year of sixth form, I had my A-level exams (exams which basically determined whether you get into your chosen university). I completed 2 of my 5 exams which went well. Then one night, as I was sleeping, I started focusing on my breathing, and on my heartbeat, then I felt my head caving in - I was having my first 'full-blown' panic attack which I remember too well. I was convinced I was dying, I ran to wake my mum up. I'm so lucky that she used to be a nurse. She told me I was having a panic attack, made me a hot chocolate at 1am, and calmed me down. I love my mum. 

Luckily I didn't have an exam that day, but I kept experiencing regular panic attacks that would last 5-10 seconds. I tried to ignore it and focus on revision. The next day, I had a biology exam in the hall, and that is the worst exam I ever sat because I kept getting interrupted by these panic attacks, and doing everything I could to stop them. After that exam, my mum took me to a doctor who thought I had GAD which was worsened due to exam stress. I spoke to my lovely English lang/lit teacher, who let me sit the rest of my exams in smaller rooms, which helped me so much. 

In between finishing sixth form (2016) and starting at university (2017) I had a severe anxiety issue which luckily didn't last too long, to do with terrorism. To show how bad it was, I refused to go to shopping centres in my city, and I decided for the first time ever not to go on my family holiday, to California where I'd always wanted to go. This anxiety isn't as bad anymore, but whenever I go on holiday, I still choose days and flight times depending on when I think the airport will be 'less risky' to visit. 

I've also suffered from health anxiety on and off for the past few years, mainly regarding cancer and my heart failing. I was coping pretty well with this up until recently, when I learned my grandma had skin cancer. Luckily, she had an operation a few days ago, I assume to remove the cancerous skin, and all went well :)

And the final anxiety I'd like to mention, probably my most severe one currently, is actually to do with my teeth. I went almost a year without looking at my own teeth - even when brushing - because I was paranoid they were turning yellow and ugly. It was honestly hell. I'm very fortunate that I have the kindest dentist, and one day I plucked the courage to tell him about this. He was super understanding, made me look at my teeth in the mirror, and gave me a 'whiteness' chart to compare my teeth to. Turns out my teeth are pretty good and my anxiety was playing tricks on me again. I can look at my teeth now and I'm pretty happy with them, but I'm not yet back to my 'old self'. I used to LOVE chocolate cake and Fanta. Now, I eat diabetic food (I'm not diabetic, heck I'm underweight) and drink nothing but water because I'm so anxious that the occasional treat and fizzy drink will ruin my teeth. I'm hoping one day I can overcome this and treat myself. 

\---

So they are all of my experiences of the anxieties I've suffered from. Writing this has genuinely made me realise how far I've come. I no longer have toilet anxiety, I smashed my 2nd year university exams and am looking forward to my final year, I no longer have to avoid holidays, I was even lucky enough to finally visit California last summer! The teeth issue and health anxiety, I still have a lot of work to do. But on Wednesday I'm finally going to see a therapist and hopefully get some more help. 

If I had to give one piece of advice to people suffering from anxiety, it's that you are not alone. You can speak to people and they will (hopefully) understand. My university has been so accommodating of my mental health, they actually let me sit my exams in a room by myself and I feel so grateful for every source of help from the past, no matter how little or much help they provided - my mum, my English teacher, my university, my ex-girlfriend, my doctor, and hopefully I'll be able to add my therapist to this list in the near future. 

I don't really know how to end this post, like I said I wanted to write it for myself as much as anyone else, because sometimes it's good to remember how far you've come. If you've took the time to read this far, thank you so much.",25Aug2019,4
94,"I feel like this has been bothering me for quite a while and I don't really feel like I want to change. But it would be good to know what am I really facing. 

I feel like I'm a sociopath, I lack empathy, I'm extremely manipulative, I tend to lie even when the situation does not require it, I am extremely egotistical, I isolate myself from others just because I think I'm superior and nobody is able to understand me, I fail to feel any emotional connection with anyone except one girl, whom I'll get to in a bit and lastly I tend to be quite aggressive and have had a history of anger issues. However, I do not really manipulate others for ""fun"" like some other sociopaths have described, I only do so when it does not ruin my reputation, hence, I do not tend to manipulate my ""friends"" directly. I would not regret or feel guilty if I took advantage of a friend if it benefits me to do so and I constantly start drama using the internet between others by pretending to be either one of them and just watch the drama unfold.

But here's where things get a bit.. weird. Unlike my suspected condition (ASPD), I can actually fall in love and I find myself not really caring about anyone except my girl. Some backstory, she suffers from depression and has said that she wanted to kill herself on several occasions, she does sometimes have pretty serious episodes where she would feel horrible. Hence, I find myself worrying about her a lot, I only really feel empathy for her and nobody else. Sometimes this incessant worrying can cause some anxiety, but I am able to control it pretty well.

I find myself needing to fake empathy towards others in everyday life in order to seem even remotely human. I've experienced the passing of family members, friends attempting suicide, friends harming themselves and honestly, I really didn't give a rat's arse in any of those situations. I felt absolutely nothing, even when everyone around me was feeling sad or crying. I just stood there, emotionless as always. I don't really experience sadness or any feelings really, apart from Happiness and Anger. 

So yeah, that sums up all that I'm feeling currently, I know it's probably not worst in this subreddit but I really have no idea if I really do have ASPD or am I just a shitty human being.",25Aug2019,1
95,"
I'm a 17-year-old guy and i really hate myself, who i'vebecome and the fact the i'm not able to change. This is going to be a long post so imgoing to divide it in different points. I need to get this out of my 
system and i need to tell someone because i'm in a really dark place right now and i hope this is going to help. I haven't been truly happy in years. I apologize the mistakes but English is my third language. 

1. My Personality I hate my personality, i'mreally different from what i
strive to be. Let's start with how i always try to be someone else around people to make them like me. When i'm around my friends, even the closest ones i often put up an act, or make up stories to make them like me. I often tell them about the sexual experiences i had with girls and make up a body count... i'm still a virgin and i've never had a Girlfriend. I started to smoke cannabis just to have something to do with some friends and make them like me. (It has now become a part of my life and has really helped my mental health). I can't stand that i act like this bit when i'm around other people its has become a habit and i do it without even thinking about it. I hate that i have social anxiety. I'm a really shy guy with new people,
i need a really long time to be open with people. I also worry to much about what people think about me, i change my behavior around people and i sometimes start tosweatt and get very anxious when speaking to regular people. But i also can be very outgoing with people i dot know and i'm not going to meet again. I'm even overthink a simple 2 word text to friend and im awfully anxious about approachingg or even only dming girls. I often try to avoid them or try not to get talked to because im afraid to be judged. I hate being in the spotlight around peoplei hate giving presentation because i'm afraid to be ridiculed for something. I even get uncomfortablee when my whole friend group listens to me. I especially despise how i sometimes put down people to be liked be other people, im areallyy bad person. An other thing is that i complain a lot about everything even when not necessary. Im really bad with people and i'm bad at helping and giving advice about serious topics. 

2. Motivation I'm really lazy, i can't motivate myself no more. I want to work out and change my body. I even enjoy it but i seem not to be able to get off my ass and do it, instead i lay in my bed and watch videos, wich i'm
hooked to. (I cant do anything without having a video playing in the background) like to paint but in 2 years i'vefinished 1 painting because iprefer the stupid yt and netflix. I want to make music but even with that i'munable to stick to it. Everything i begin i'm Not able to finish i never want to put the work/time into something. Rn i dont
even want to finish this and go back to watching videos. I'm not motivated enough to change, i simply cant bring myself to put the work in to stop doing the things that make me hate myself. 

3. Sexuality
This is a very subject for me, so i'm not going into details. I can't figure out my sexuality i don't know if im straight, bi or gay. I think to be gay i really don't want to. 

4. Future
I'm afraid of the future; i don't know what to do with my life, i'm a 9 to 5 type of guy and i want even to go to university becausei
dislike school. I chose a catering school because iwanted to become a chef but after 2 months working as a cook i don't want to do that anymore. I also worked as a waiter and didn't like that either. 


I don't know if i included everything but this are some simplified reasons why i hate myself. I wasnt even able to write a decent post. I need help but idon't want to go to psychologist. This makes me feel awful and i even contemplated suicide i'mto much of a pussy to even do that and i
don't want to hurt my family and my friends.",25Aug2019,1
96,"Hi,

I'm not sure where to really ask this, so I thought i'd give this a shot. My cousin is a women in her mid 20s, not the best of childhoods (parents constantly fight with eachother, alcholic dad), she has few friends and has been in multiple failed relationships. She was in univeristy and finished a degree in psychology, its been 3 years and she's still unemployed and recently broke up with her bf. She's been quite depressed and lacks motivations, has gained quite a bit of weight. About 1.5 months ago she started getting into spirtuality, like healing stones and life paths, tarot readings. I didn't think much of it, just thought of it as a phase ( she's had a lot of phases, goth, emo, vegan, environmentalist, anime nerd, kpop fandom). She regularly smokes marijuana and from time to time she's indicated she has taken shrooms. A few weeks ago she said she was going to go on a healing cleanse (Iwoska something), basically people take drugs together and say they can talk to god? We were worried and told her not to do it, but we didnt tell her parents cause there dealing with a dying grandma and she said her dad was going to do it with her. Anyways she says that not enough people signed up so the Iwoska retreat was cancelled. Fastforward to yesterday she's a complete mess, she's saying she wants to suicide and is talking about religious figures and her saviours (she was an atheist all her life until 1.5 months ago). My family took her in yesterday because her mothers a complete mess. She followed me last night and told me to tell the truth, I was like ""what do you mean?"" She apparently thinks I am a messenger from her saviours, and her saviours are BTS (BTS is a kpop group of boys she's crazy about). She wants to leave home and live with them, I ask her how thats possible when they live in korea, and she insists they live here (Canada, ontario). I don't understand whats happening, I feel like its schizophrenia given the symptoms, or maybe drug withdrawl (she stopped her antidepressants cold turkey 3 weeks ago). She claims her father raped her as a kid and at 16, so she won't go back home. We also think she is talking to someone who she may have sent her nudes, maybe a cult leader controlling her who she thinks is her god?( I think, i put this together from her behaviour) I understand we have to take her to the hospital and have convinced her mom to do so. Its just I don't know how to take her. She is a fully legal adult and can deny going. Any advice would be great, or opinions.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally think she went to this Iwoska retreat and lied that it was cancelled. And the cult leader raped her and she tooks drugs with them. Maybe the trauma was too much and she's hallucinating. She says gods talking to her, that shes a reincarnation of a god, and hearing and feeling spirtual presences. 

She comes from a conservative immigrant family, so its very hard to explain this to them. Advice and help please!",25Aug2019,1
97,"My mom isn't like normal moms. She doesn't work. She doesn't do the dishes or cook any food. She's too ""tired"" to work. We wouldn't be able to afford food if it wasn't for my big sister sending us money every month.

I don't know what condition my mom has. She refuses to see a doctor. But I think she has OCD and is depressed. Maybe a bit of anxiety sprinkled in. If my mom would just go and see a doctor, we would have her diagnosed and then be able to get support from outside. But well. That's not possible.

It's my duty to make sure that the apartment is clean, that there is food in the fridge and that our clothes are clean. If I don't do it, no one will.

I'm still in school. So I can't afford to move out now. And even if I could afford it... Who would look after my mom? She can't take care of herself and I'm tired of looking after her.

100,"I was recently diagnosed with ASD (level 1, no intellectual or linguistic impairments) and ADHD (combined presentation). I'm doing the best that I'm capable of without much support from anyone else. Despite this, my father is unsatisfied. In one way, I get it. He's got four fucky kids and no help from his wife, who probably also has autism, ADHD, or both. He's constantly stressed out at work and home. His home is a mess because his family doesn't keep it clean, which makes it that much harder to get rid of the roaches that his wife's shitty friend infested us with. But i still can't take it when he gets all surly and grumpy because of these problems. It makes me wish I could fix the problem, which makes me wish I could kill myself. I don't want to deal with this. I want my parents to support and help me so I can hopefully one day live on my own. I want things to be okay, but they aren't and they probably never will be.

105,"First post ever, I just feel like I need to get this all out. 

I feel like I’m constantly burdening the people in my life with my constant overthinking, panic attacks, and general mental health issues. I understand that the cause for this stuff isn’t my fault just a result of being raised in the wrong way but, I still feel really guilty. It’s definitely been worse and I know that ninety nine percent of the time I put the stress on myself but, I don’t know how to stop. The root of my problems is my belief that work is pain and if I’m not hurting, I’m not working. The problem with that belief though is that I can’t prioritize any of my energy. This paired with an overactive mind leads to my bouts of insomnia which leaves me with even less energy to work with the next day.

Overthinking and obsession is a cycle that I don’t know how to break. It just makes me stress about stressing and makes me think that if I work myself hard enough I will be happy. I know the problem but I don’t know how to fix it.

119,"FYI:I just want to say before hand my family has no history of mental illness and this is the first time anything like this has happened to me

I was laying down in my bed just messing around with my belly button and I guess I most have dozed off cause I woke up to the feeling of part of my stomach coming out. (I recently had surgery for my appendix) I started immediately feeling horrible and I thought I was going to die. I felt my neck getting very stiff and I started getting very sleepy. I was getting so tired I couldn't even open my eyes. I said to myself “I’m going to die right here alone” I then thought of who would find my body. I just wanted to sleep but then something happened and I immediately started of thinking of ways of getting help. I was deciding on calling out for my Mom for help or immediately calling 911. I decided on 911 and that meant I had to open my eyes and I did just that and I looked at my stomach and everything was fine. I started looking for even a small cut or something but turned out with nothing I was completely fine. It’s just been stuck in my head and I don’t know what’s going on.",25Aug2019,2

121,"I expect this to be normal but I'm asking just in case. When I feel strong hatred, I actually feel something physical in my stomach. It feels somewhat like a cold liquid is spreading, and it has that 'pulling' feeling that you get with fear, except in the stomach instead of spine. And of course, it hurts. It's visceral but not localized, somewhat soft and sharp at the same time.

I hope the description is good enough for other people to identify it in case it isn't just a me thing. I think this is generally caused by stress, probably something to do with the suprarenals but this is a blind guess.",25Aug2019,1
122,"Hey guys, sorry this will be a little long. I’m so lost on this and really need some perspective. I (26F) recently separated from my husband. Today, my family (mom, sister, step dad, and aunt) helped me move to a new apartment in a new city.

I have bipolar disorder II with panic attacks occasionally. I don’t let my family see a lot of the bad stuff and I prefer to take care of things myself. I’m very independent and good at managing my symptoms with medication most of the time. This is probably why they don’t get what happened.

This morning before everyone got to my old apartment to pack the uhaul, I had a panic attack because I was afraid of what was coming next. Just the unsureness of the future and all that. I came pretty close to packing my car and running away but I didn’t. 

We got to the new apartment and everything was going well. Finally feeling like I’d have a new start in a new place with a healthy life. I’d be living with my sister and it would be cool. 

However, my sister and I get into an argument (this is fairly common). It escalated to cursing and all but my stress threshold was so low because of everything that was going on. Divorce, life changes, etc. it’s all still pretty fresh. So, in front of my mom, sister, and aunt, I had a pretty gnarly panic attack.

I knocked a few things off a table, I fell to the floor and was screaming, not at anyone, just screaming. I disassociated a little and hit myself in the face. This is a pretty common way panic attacks can be for me. Never once did I harm another person, nor have I ever.  The whole episode lasted 5 minutes tops.

No one attempted to help. I calmed myself down, cleaned up what was knocked of, and started looking for my keys which I couldn’t find. When something like this happens, I like to drive to clear my head.

In that time, a police officer shows up. My mom had this look on her face that I can’t explain. Like she was uncomfortable and didn’t want to upset me but felt like she was doing the right thing. Almost smug honestly. And My aunt, who is a nurse although full disclosure, she has a serious drug problem, called them. 

I talked to the officer and assured him it was ok, that I was calm, and that it was just a panic attack. I had to do the same when the EMTs arrived. You should have seen them roll their eyes when I told them what happened. They let me go and sent me away with some mental health resources. 

I came back and I was so angry. I said nasty comments to everyone, especially my aunt. Saying angrily like, “Have you ever seen a panic attack?? I hope you feel like a hero.” Everyone in my family has these problems. My sister has panic attacks this bad. It’s not like this is new territory.

I packed a bag and left. My mom asked where I was going and I said to a friend. I responded calmly to all her texts. Here’s where it gets even worse. I went to a friends house to calm down, and later went to another friend to maybe sleep there. They didn’t answer (it was like 2 AM) so I was just going to sleep in my car. Then I get a tap on my window and it is THE POLICE. My family had gone in front of a magistrate and LIED to them to get a court order out to find me. They NEVER texted to try to find me. I told her where I was. I was stable. The police and EMT already cleared me. 

Luckily the cops were honestly very compassionate through this whole thing. But I had to be handcuffed and driven to the hospital, then walked through in handcuffs in front of everyone. I was in there for ten minutes before they released me. The doctor and police made me feel better because they said this happens all the time. Parents who freak out and think their kid needs to be out away rather than work on medication or therapy, etc. Said 9/10 times it’s like this. But they were very kind to me and dropped me back off at my car. 

I was completely distraught. Everything in my life was looking up and then this happens. I will say that objectively, it was scary to watch. If you’re not used to seeing panic attacks, or the way they can manifest, it can freak you out. My mom and sister said they were scared. I have never laid a finger on them in my entire life. But I can see how it was scary and I think people make bad choices when they’re scared and don’t understand something. However, I think them using that excuse is so selfish. I’m the one going through all these terrible things. If that made them feel bad, imagine what I’m going through.

So here’s what I’m feeling. I am feeling so hurt it’s hard to express it. I feel betrayed, ashamed, embarrassed, like a monster and a freak. Like I couldn’t look them or anyone really in the eye. I feel scared that I will lose my autonomy. I feel abandoned. I feel like I don’t know how things can be the same again after they tried to commit me involuntarily for a panic attack. Twice in one day.

No one tried to help. No one asked if I was ok. No one asked what I needed. No one asked if I needed to go to the hospital. I have voluntarily taken myself there twice over the 10 years I’ve had this illness because I take it very seriously. This was not even remotely an emergency and no one thought to respect me enough to have a conversation once I was calm.

And despite the fact that I was literally good to go according to both medical professionals and law enforcement, they still think they are right and somehow I’m the bad guy. When I’m the person hurting and needing my family. And I doubt that unless there is a huge change of heart, I’ll ever be able to go back there. Which leaves me squarely on my friends couch for as long as she’ll take me.

My aunt had absolutely no business doing what she did. She doesn’t know me and she doesn’t know my symptoms. My mom does to an extent, in fact she will almost always be the person to give me control in a situation and let me take care of myself. I think this happened because of my aunt pressuring her and my sister being scared so she was torn.

So I guess some general advice or insight about this situation would be really helpful, but mainly I see need help with knowing how to make things right with my family. It’s so hard because I’m so hurt and feel so betrayed. I’m also still angry.

It makes me sick thinking about this situation. I want to make us all good again but I need them to understand my perspective. I have no idea how. I think what I would have ideally wanted is for them to, once I had calmed down, sit me down and talk to me. I would have considered something outpatient. We could have looked at counseling resources together. I am open minded and I want to be ok. But every choice was taken from me and I feel traumatized by this.

My sister who has seen how insane this is and has taken my side is coming tomorrow to mediate between me and my mom and other sister. She is very good at mediation and will be fair. I hope I feel up to it tomorrow. I just want to fix this but they also have to understand my perspective. 

Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",25Aug2019,2

Not sure if this is the best place to put this, and it's obviously a throwaway account, but I'm scared as hell.

My long time girlfriend/might as well be my wife had a total mental breakdown last night. This isn't the first, but it was the worst.

Long story short, I heard her hitting the keypad to open my gunsafe. I knew she was in a bad headspace and not doing well, so I ran in there and she told me she wanted to kill herself. I stopped her from opening the safe, got her out of the room and changed the combination to something she doesn't know and would never guess. I thought maybe she'd sleep it off or something, but she tried to access the safe again and became irate and manic when she realized I had changed the combination. She then went for a kitchen knife, and I had to restrain her.

She then left the house, no shoes, no wallet, no purse, no cellphone, no underwear, no bra, nothing but a nightgown and started walking. She stated she was going to her mom's, which is a good 20 miles away. I convinced her to get in the car, and I drove her to her moms. She continued with the manic and suicidal thoughts and expressions there, and then decided that she wanted to go to the hospital. We took her to the hospital and they Baker Acted her. I stayed at the hospital with her for about 5 hours before they made me leave when the day shift came in, and shortly thereafter called me and told me they found a bed at North Tampa Behavioral Health, and that a police officer will be transporting her there today.

She has since been transported and admitted to NTBH.  

First and foremost, I know she needs help and I'm glad she's going to start getting it. But, I'm scared shitless for her.  I see a metric shit ton of terrible reviews for the hospital. I think I understand that they can only keep her for 72 hours unless a judge signs an order committing her, and that they are obligated to have a mental health professional evaluate her sooner.  I have spoke to her a couple times today since she's been admitted.  

She mentioned that a lot of the people there are saying that they hold you beyond the 72 hours.  I was under the impression that that required a substantial reasoning and legal proceedings.

Well it all started on december 2017. I really liked a girl, and as I was changing school, I wanted to keep contact. And well, she didnt answer me, so some days agter I started sending more messages asking if she was alright and everything. This kept happenkng until february, when I said that if she didnt want to answer me she shoul block me, then I blocked her.
It would have ended up there but days after I once again called her, she didnt answer, I waited some days and blocked her again.
But I got really sad, I couldnt think about other things, lost will of doing things etc
And even though I dont like her anymore, I never recovered my heart. My life is quite bad, since those times, I failed to make friends on the new school, stoppee reading (I loved reading) and I know that Ill be a failure, which is terrible becaise my parents count on me. Im too shy to talk to girls, still a virgin and unable to kiss a girl for the last two years. I know I need to study, because I need to do great in the ENEM (Brazilian public university national exam) but I cant focus, I got addicted on social media internet and mobile in general amd even when Im studying whitout it, I cant focus, not even in classes. Idk what to do and there are sometimes that I think I didnt kill myself yet because of these reasons: 1st cause Im a Catholic and that would be a sin, 2nd becaise I have dutirs to my family and Im not capable of making my parents, and grandparents suffer like this and Idk man I just live for obbligation woth these things. I recognize that other people have very worse situations than me, which only makes me angry to myself because they can endure and I cant even endure my problems.

127,"People will say that surviving isn't living, but it is better than just doing nothing and hoping that one day everything will get better.

Life is cruel, oh yes it is cruel. But it is when life is beating you down, taking everything away from you that having that thrive to live on will help you. Maybe it'll not amount to anything but I'd rather be a hare fighting for my life constantly than being the cabbage that it's gonna eat.

Yes fighting for your wellbeing is hard, yes each steps towards improvement will tear your spirit down, yes at times you will fall, sometimes even deeper than before. But if you fight through it, if you show the will power to overcome it, later you'll be able to look back at it and say ""yes, I have won. Yes, I beat it. Yes, I am more powerful than that.""

It's tiresome, it's demoralising, but even if you die trying at least you can say to yourself ""I did not get beaten so easily""

This is for all those that feel like giving up. Keep fighting, as long as your lungs still breath, and your heart still beat, and you brain still think, you can  do it, you can power through it. Be the hero of your own story, a story that only you, can keep writing.

135,"Hi guys,

This summer I finally finished school after thirteen long years and while I was happy it was finally over, I did not think that the future wouldn't be brighter for me either.

School has always been a downer for me. I've had issues adjusting ever since I can remember and the lack of knowledge I gained during the last three years of school led me to feel like I'm stuck in a dark hole constantly. I wondered why I'm still going and during my senior year there was hardly a week of school that I fully attended. Why would I get up daily at 6am to do nothing? I just couldn't bear it anymore, I didn't see the point. 

To fast forward, I applied to an university and thought this major would be perfect for me. I ended up getting rejected and now I'm stuck in what feels like an even darker hole.

After I received the rejection I realized that this is probably not the right thing for me. Technically I'd be skilled enough for it, but the job lacks things I really look for. 

At this point I have no idea what to do with my life and it's constantly stressing me out. I did an apprenticeship at the local newspaper here and while it did went well and I had lots of fun, I'm not sure if it'd be something I'd truly want to study and later on work as.

I wish someone would just make a decision for me, honestly. This is all too much for me and I don't know how to handle it. I've looked at so many jobs and majors in the past few weeks and nothing has truly sparked joy in me.

There's rarely a day that goes by that I'm not feeling stretched thin with stress or anxiety.  My thoughts are obsessive and often unwanted. Some days I feel ridiculously worn out from worry and stress. Other days I feel hopeless and almost dead with depressive, defeatist thinking. I experience existential dread almost daily. I rarely leave my house, I have no friends and don't have a lot of social interaction in my life. 

I sometimes feel almost repulsed with physical affection. I love my mom but I don't really like being hugged by her for some reason. I also find myself feeling irritable and annoyed sometimes when she cries. I wish I didn't feel like this but it's just like an involuntary reaction to hearing crying. On the other hand, when I was in a relationship, I loved when my partner would show me physical affection. 

 I often find myself being inconsiderate and dismissive of other peoples' emotions.

I fully recognize that this is a problem but I don't really know how to change it.

And to be honest, I know I'll kill myself in the future, alone in my house, with no friends or family that care, I won't even need to write a letter, and I've been trying to deal with that truth but it hurts. But the only way I might stop this is to force myself into a mental hospital, since no one will take care of me, and it's pretty clear that I don't care about anything anymore, so... I don't know that to do anymore. I mean, dying or living is equally lonely, it's just that in one I won't notice it.

Please help me, I can't stand this, and haven't been able to for years, i lost my chance of a life before it even started, I just want love, any fucking form of love, didn't get it from my mom, my dad, who left, from my mother's boyfriend or anyone else, and you know what? They shouldn't, I don't deserve it and I sure as hell know that it wouldn't be good for anyone to care about me, since I'm clearly fucking drowning.",25Aug2019,1
143,"March 5, 2012 to March 12, 2012 I was sent to a mental hospital cause I started to hurt. Last day I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. I wish I could of stayed longer. So now I want to enter a mental health program. I want to be a inpatient. Wherever that maybe need to be away for awhile. How has that experience been for others? I want my mind to feel clear. I even look into Electroshock Therapy. I'm desperate to feel better. Feeling alone and overlooked most of the time I hated it in school. I wanted to use my voice more. Was put down for my speech impediment. Made me just watch everything go by became shy. For six years I barely spoke it really got to me. Thirteen years I've been depress so now I'm 25 and the future does not look like a promising one.",25Aug2019,2
