1,"I’ve always heard that people have a ‘voice in their head’ ,like a narrative going on in their head. But i honestly don’t remember experiencing this. Maybe when i was younger, but not that i remember. I have to mental force myself to think about things, or else i’ll sit there for hours not really doing anything, and i’ll look back and realize that it happened. I’ve tried looking for an explanation but just can’t find one, any one else like this ?",27Mar2020,1
2,"For the last few years I've been trying to get my shit together.  I'm in my late 20s, and it's only in the last few years that I've been able to be a productive member of society.  Before then I was a remorseless drug addict and had issues well beyond that.  I had no idea how to act normal, and never had anything productive to talk about.  Girls freaked me out, feeling like I wasn't good enough, and I was pretty cut off from reality.
Since then, I'm pretty decent at acting normal, but 
I'm not sure how to not feel so alone.  I think I need to connect with people, but I have no idea how to want to do it.  On and off I've been able to do, once I'm out of the groove of things,however, I forget how to do it.  My confidence will take a nose dive.

Even when I'm being myself I feel like an alien.  The things I like are wierd-science, ideas, asking, why,why,why.  The corona virus is a god send, because normal people are interested in science and the economy for once.  I come from a good family, but I'm living in a Puerto Rican boarding house working at a random factory.  I live so far away from home that I don't have a family in practicr...I was worried about going to work while they were doing the temperature checks because I knew if I had a fever and for sent home, I don't know anyone who would be able to give me a ride back home.  Work provides transportation, so I'd have to walk the 20 or so miles back.  Not really self pity, but that fact dawned on me earlier and I was like damn.

Idk...it seems like I'm a late bloomer in life.  Everyone already seems to have their set friends and significant others...I don't know how I'm supposed to fit into things.  I've never once met a girl-or really anybody in the last few years-who gives a shit about the things that I care about.  I'm not sad about it, just numb.  Empty room, empty life.  I'm used to living like this, but a part of me knows that the way I'm living is desolate.  Devoid of really anyone to have meaningful contact with, most days I just want to die.

Not literally-i just want to be something and somewhere that's not me.",27Mar2020,1
3,"First I’ll start with friends and relationships.
 
I’m 18 almost 19 years old, and I’ve never been in a relationship. This is because of many reasons. The biggest reason is because I’ve been homeschooled and isolated for the majority of my life. Other reasons is because I struggle with socializing with people, and I just can’t handle the responsibility of a relationship or friends. Whenever I try to talk to anyone, I either end up losing them because of how sucky I am with socializing, or because I have to let them go. I know this sounds weird, but friends are a distraction for me. Whenever I meet someone, I get distracted and start failing at everything else in life. So I just have to let them go. This hurts because I’m lonely, but can’t find a way to make, or keep and manage friends. I also feel like I just won’t be a good friend or boyfriend. This is because I struggle with responsibilities in general. I just feel like I won’t be able to consistently be there for someone, help them, and be kind to them. I’m like 80% sure I have ADHD. So that goes with pretty much any responsibility I have.

I just can’t handle responsibilities. I pretty much fail at anything I do. And I’m practically useless. For most days I’m lazy and can barely get anything done. I’ll have those occasional good days, where I just get a lot done. But those are rare. 

I also have a horrible relationship with my parents. I really, really, hate them to the core. They’ve put me through so much emotional abuse, and I don’t think I’ll ever forgive them. 

My dad cheated many times on my mom, and has threatened to leave time and time again. He’s also a alcoholic and has threatened to beat me before. My mom has mostly said hurtful things, blamed me for things, etc. but I remember a few times when she sexually touched me when I was maybe like 11 or 12. They’ve also done sexual things in front of me. Which these things messed me up, and caused me to become a sicko, and do some stupid messed up things as a hormonal teenager.  

Of course, I don’t do these things anymore, but I still hate myself for them.

They also weren’t supportive when it comes to my mental health, dental, etc. I’d go for yearly checkups at the doctor, but that’s it. I haven’t been to the doctor in like 10 years because they’d never take me for even an exam. And now I have to figure how to fix my messed up teeth on my own. And my mental health is obviously messed up as well, and has been for years.

 I’ll admit, my parents are financially supportive when it comes to buying me things, like a car, then trading it in for another one, and video games, etc. And I’m thankful for that. But I still really hate them for everything else. I don’t care what they’ve bought me, I hate them for all the emotional abuse they’ve put me through, I don’t think I’ll ever forgive them either. I’m planning on cutting ties with them once I can get out on my own. And probably moving far away. But I don’t know how I’ll be able to ever do that, knowing that I can’t handle any responsibilities.

I just can’t handle life at all. I can’t get my life together, I can’t handle any responsibilities and I don’t know what to do. I feel like a useless scum. Everything just feels hopeless.",27Mar2020,1
4,"Like there’s just no one who looks like me, acts like me, or is anything like me and it sucks. Like I’m not trying to be “unique” or anything it’s just that I wanna have idols that I can look up to that are like me. Like they dress like me, look like me, and act like me but I can’t find anyone. Ik I probably sound dumb but sometimes I feel like I just wanna be a different person. Like I don’t like my face and I kinda wanna be a singer but like I don’t know if I have the visuals let alone the talent to become one, (or even the voice.) I wanna be someone, but it’s just so confusing. Sometimes I just don’t really feel like I belong in this body. Like who the fuck am I? I’m sorry for ranting, you don’t have to read this it’s just me having a panic attack again. I’m afraid that I’ll never be talented enough and I’ll never become pretty when I get older and all my dreams will just end up being nothing and meaningless. I just want someone else’s life. With a perfect mind, heart, soul. Is that even possible to go through life without injuring your mind, heart, and soul? Is that even possible? Ik I sound dumb but like why is there no one like me? Like I wanna have a soulmate or a twin flame or whatever. Why can’t I be like everyone else? Why am I like this? Why am I here? Why do I feel old? Why does the world never fucking change? I’m sorry for ranting, but thanks if you read all this",27Mar2020,1
5,"Hi, I'm in the US and I'm just wondering... How are y'all all not having panic attacks? I haven't had problems with them for almost a year and now because of Coronavirus and the distraught that it will bring. I am struggling. Does anyone have any advice on to help me calm tf down? 
My parents just told me they both have CV and they are in another state. My SO in his 40s also has it. They are all I have of family. Everyone is losing their jobs, the economy is going to crash, and the only people who can help us -doctors- are dying trying to help us. 
I am losing my shit.",27Mar2020,1
6,"I don’t know why, i post as regular, nothing provocative, but this week alone i’ve been called “whore” three times in different contexts, slut, dumb, ugly and a lot more bad things. i just don’t understand why the internet seems to have turned into this really evil place for me in the last week. this started monday! i’ve been having panic attacks almost everyday this week and i just can’t seem to find a community online that’s positive and friendly. there’s always someone who’s gonna come along and ruin it. i’m starting to think it’s just me. cause they don’t attack other people posting normal posts like mine. this happened on reddit, instagram and tiktok, even in real life and i’m honestly giving up. at this point in my life i’m trying my hardest to cope with old rediscovered trauma and these people aren’t helping. i’m so done with being online honestly",27Mar2020,1
7,"Sorry if this is a weird question. 

For a long time now, I have had some weird ass dreams and thoughts. I feel like this is kinda embarrassing to admit honestly. Sometimes I have dreams about violently Raping people I know. To be clear, I would NEVER hurt them in real life. But I just get these fantasies and It arouses me for some reason, I don't even hate the people I have these thoughts about. It greatly distresses me having these thoughts and I don't know what to do. To some extent I even indulge in the thoughts by not pushing them out of my head because they arouse me. I also become a little obsessed of the women I have these fantasies about sometimes to the point of borderline cyber stalking :/

I don't know what to do, any advice? Is this normal?",27Mar2020,1

11,"Hi all, feel like I'm struggling lately. I have been on a lengthy wait list for mental health help, pre pandemic I was told 6 more months. I finally got an appointment at like an after care clinic I was hoping for further assessment. I have GAD and Depression diagnosis. 

My appointment was cancelled.  I was not offered a telephone conference or anything in the mean time.

I'm really struggling lately I believe I have undiagnosed ADHD, Possibly Autism but if not severe misaphonia. I also feel like ptsd is an issue as I have dealt with a lot of trauma in my life. I cannot focus on anything or complete things. I am a female in her 30's and really feeling like I have lost the ability to function.

13,"When my long term boyfriend cheated with me, I lost all the self confidence. I couldnt even to anyone because I thought I was even bad at speaking or writing English. He used to criticize my grammer, way I spoke and even what I wrote. I was in a dark place basically. I didnt believe in myself. Things got worse when I moved in my relatives. I stayed there for 2 years to save money in expensive city. My relatives only yelled at me all the time. I couldnt think and couldnt feel anything. I moved out from there few months ago and I am at friends place. 
I can finally breathe and relax here. But I have no motivation in life. I dont know where I am going and what I am doing. Still have very low confidence in myself. I know I need to get out of all this but what happened in the past still bothers me. I get frustrated coz I dont know what to do next.

14,"I do not want to use apps such as Talkspace since the price depends on the package you pick. For the audio options, the price can be upwards of $300 a month. I also prefer face to face or video interaction of some sort but just not over messaging of any kind. I have medical insurance but my deductible is too high to pay for therapy through insurance and would be cheaper out of pocket for a sliding scale.

Like for example, let's say I listen to a sad song, and I don't cry, I'm like: ""Why didn't I cry? I must be a narcissist because I obviously lack empathy"". The thing is I don't think I'm able to cry, over anything. My life could be ruined and I would feel REALLY bad, but I don't think I would cry. I want to be able to cry, but I honestly don't know how. How do I stop worrying if I have narcissism? Or do I have narcissism and should feel bad about it? Idk. It probably doesn't help that I have bad anxiety.",27Mar2020,1

20,"Help.

Background...  I'm a successful, stable professional.  I speak in front of groups, I've raised several kids out of foster care, I've looked down the barrel of a gun getting mugged in Eastern Europe, I dove into a freezing lake to save a drowning toddler once.  I was a competitive extreme skiier as a youth and I'm a competitive hockey coach today.  I run a successful business, I'm the chair of several organizations.

Today, I'm sitting at home wracked with anxiety attacks.  I went for a run earlier and my watch reported my heart rate actually went DOWN when I was running from when I was sitting at home.

But the minute, I crossed the threshold to come inside, I was overcome with anxiety and a clamping feeling inside and I can't shake it.

I spent some time meditating yesterday to get it under control and I was partially successful, but I ended up taking a couple sleeping pills to get to sleep, finally, at 5am.

I can't do this very much longer and I don't know what to do.   I went to the grocery store and stood to the side of the grocery aisle and chatted with random people.  It was the best thing that's happened in days, it felt sane and normal.

As soon as I got in my car to leave, I was overcome with anxiety.

I've known a lot of people with social anxiety.

It appears I have a case of the opposite thing?   Separation anxiety?  Quarantine anxiety?

The problem is that \*\*I'm not functional\*\* right now. I can't work a lot of the day, I can barely get out of bed sometimes.  If I get smashed drunk it goes away.  Some porn helps for a few minutes.

But it creeps back over the coming minutes or hours and it's eating me up.

Any coping strategies?

What do I do?",27Mar2020,1
21,"She’s really sweet to me. But hearing about her delusional stories about the universe and earth just gives me so much anxiety and unease for some reason. I don’t want to be rude and tell her to stop, so I force myself to listen. She’s told me that my depression was a result of be being a bad person in my past life, and that I am now paying for it.

22,"I feel terrible right because I believe I'm being horribly manipulative to my family. 

I do this a lot. Every time we argue (which is a lot - I blow up into crazy anger at the smallest little thing and it spirals out of control into fights), I hole myself up in my room and don't come out for ages. When I have the chance, I sneak out and load up my room with muesli bars or other snacks. Then I skip meals (lunch and dinner with the family) to pretend as if I'm not eating so that they feel worried about me. I hate myself for doing this because I feel like I'm being manipulative and I don't know why I act like this.

Shes pushed everyone away. Shes been in and out of hospitals every couple years.

26,"It's been a week since I came home from upstate NY to Long Island. I went to college upstate and was having a good semester, got an offer for a job that is suppose to start in May for an engineering company around campus, started the year very nicely with my boyfriend that I met last year. But I got kicked out of my dorm and had to pack my things and leave my city in upstate and come back home to be with my parents. My family has been dysfunctional since I was young so I always had mental issues all the way until I went the college and my depression. My parents are very strict and my parents have a lot of hatred in their relationship and verbally abusing each other to the point it gets physical once in a while. I started to get better mentally when I was living on my own. The possibility of being stuck home for months and my internship getting cancelled is eating my mind alive.

I really could use someone to talk to right now. I have no privacy at my house. my family members keep barging into my bedroom every twenty minutes. I can't even properly take a nap or sleep or do my online class without someone coming into my room and bothering me.

29,"Alright now that I’ve hopefully drawn you in with that dramatic heading I want to explain where I’m coming from. I’m a very logical person, some would say I have little empathy, others would say my actions border on sociopathy and as a result I likely process things different than most people. I simply cannot understand what anyone sees in life as a whole; I’m not saying that living is too much or that I struggle at all but simply that I don’t understand why everyone else wants to live. Maybe my viewpoint is corrupted by my logic but all the things other people want. Love, money, sex, they all seem so pointless and the idea that we live every day for those around us seems so insignificant. I’ve been to therapy multiple times, I’ve been told I’m an apathetic young man that is either bisexual or asexual and the only thing I’ve ever found solace in is hatred. Without that hatred I have found that I am nothing, no motivation, no goals, no hopes and no reason to live. I’m not going to kill myself because I find it ridiculous but currently I’m miserable. If I wanted to go to therapy I surely could but I just don’t see how it would help me. How is talking with someone going to change the fact that I find no value in anything at all, I find some pleasure in my interactions with others but even then I think this may just be a distraction from what I see to be the true facts of life, life only means what you believe it to mean and below that it is nothing. I wish I could find something to live for, any reason to live and yet all that I can find is that the only thing anybody lives for is hope that things get better or for interpersonal relationships which in the end are pointless. I don’t know what to do, I don’t know where to go, and I don’t know who to talk to in order to help myself. Which is why I’ve ended up here on a random subreddit of the internet.

31,"I've never liked doing work at home, if I had home work, I'd do it at school or rush and half ass it when I got home.

For me, there's school and there's home, one gives me anxiety sometimes because I'm obese and the other is relaxing mostly.

I hate mixing them, when I absolutely had to do an assignment at home I'd procrastinate severely in front of the computer and I'd get this feeling in my forehead. I'm not sure how to describe it but it's a light feeling on my forehead/eyes that I can best describe as annoying, I'm annoyed.

With the coronavirus we have online learning now and the teachers barely know what to do, this week is supposed to be easy, just discussion questions and quick reviews of what we were going over, but that feeling in my forehead persists and it's been an hour of me sitting at computer and doing nothing, I try to get started but can't and get frustrated.

I went through what I believe was a mini depression episode in January,  I didn't want to do anything, not the things I love and especially the things I don't, I just wanted to be in my bed and I'd get annoyed at the thought of having to do anything. I didn't say anything to anyone about it because it would just come off as me being lazy.

Also had some pretty negative thoughts about myself during that depression.


I should also mention that my grandma on my moms side was depression diagnosed with severe depression (they straight up told us they're shocked that she never attempted suicide) and I'm pretty sure my dad has depression, there's definitely something wrong with him but I don't know if he's been diagnosed

32,"Okay so I have visited a therapist a few times and it didn't go well. Things she told me: ""You can't do things you love ever anyway, so just get used to it."" ""You don't have any problems you're just weird."" ""You keep faking the victim for attention."" ""It's not about your mental state, it's about school.""

Now is anyone here a professional, knows a professional who can help me or knows a place where I could contact a professional fod free?

Here are my problems pretty much: I keep dissociating with myself, my body and my entire existence. I have a hard time believing that I am real and that I as an entity exist. I don't know why its been like this ever since I was 10 (I'm 13 now).

I'm mad at everyone...? I just don't like people. I am super sensitive to literally sounds of people talking. If it's a topic that I even in the slightest dislike I will start swearing, I'll become extremely uncomfortable, I'll start feeling overwhelmed. Every time I have a conversation with anyone I just end up being upset.

I see things kind of different, at least I've been told so. I don't know is it because my skepticism or what but you have to convince me that something that is obviously true, true. Like for example once my friend told me she had a ""the 1975"" band T-shirt. I was so convinced she was lying about and was faking it for fun, when she actually showed me the shirt I was so surprised. Another example is my told me that we were going to this one place I didn't exactly know the path to. I knew the place 100%, just not how to get to it. I was so convinced he was lying I literally started trying to get there by myself. Turns out he wasn't lying to me and I almost got lost. I also need to touch or interact with an object in order to be convenient that it's real. Final example would be fruits. When I see a fruit I NEED to peel it to be convinced that indeed it is the fruit that it is. 

For a long period in my life I was convinced that a pink pencil sharpener had killed me. Basically I took this pink sharpener from school without permission and kept it. Then when I started dissociating I was convinced that the pink pencil sharpener killed me and I was in hell. I also for a long time believed that all triangles were evil and wanted to kill me.

When I was in kindergarten I would often fantasise about goblins sexually abusing women. That's it I am myself disturbed at that fact.

I haven't been able to sleep for a long time. I just can't shut down. Even when I was little (4-3 yrs old) I would sing until 2 am. Recently I would just go pacing around my room, or twitching, being unable to stop my thoughts from rushing. Even once when I pulled an all nighter for 2 days straight I was full of energy and constantly wanted to sing and talk to myself. I just need help with falling asleep because it's becoming a huge problem

Tw kind of s*lf h*rm. I kind of just hurt myself for fun when I'm bored. I know this comes off as SuPeR EdGy OmG, but hear me out. I don't know what it is I just like the adrenalin rush when I do it makes me feel happy.

That's it, please help me because due to these facts I haven't been able to make friends I need serious advice.",27Mar2020,1
33,"Some people believe in destroying the ego, have symbiotic or parasitic ideologies.  Independence and Leadership is no long about you, it's about you and a group of people.  A group of people pushing you around, it's about us, the organization.    You made this, we made this.

Running in particular helps flush out all toxins and hormones.  I was never that strong of a runner but it's not something I took for granted.  Struggling with gout and arthritis as such a young age has been a very demoralizing experience.  

I had recovered from the herniated discs that I struggled with for years since my early 20's.  I remedied the herniated discs with an inversion table and rocking back and forth.  There are ongoing studies in commercializing this as a solution for herniated discs.  It cured my sciatica and over time I was able to strength my lower back with routine exercise.  I do seem to suffer some atrophy there and think a few injections of juice would really fix me up.  I do not suffer atrophy anywhere else, there's some type of imbalance there.   You have to learn to body sense of balance, which muscle groups may be over powering the others.  I tend to stick with compound exercises trying to maintain balance,  Typical squats, pull ups, chin ups, swimming.  Isometric exercise and generic routines.  To much bench press or something, you need to do more radial exercise, like swimming, to balance out your muscles.  All I got is bro-science and all, but I feel I reached a good understanding how radial exercise like swimming is a necessity for a well balanced body.  

Having fasted so long I need to make sure my nutrition is adequate or I crash.  I'm 240lbs, pretty masculine with little exercise.  Over the years I've learned getting my proteins and calories in to maintenance level, even without regular exercise, maintains a very nice masculine physique. I am uncertain if it's verified but the fasting increases your bodies HGH, I think it's evident in my experience.  I can get into shape in a few weeks of lite exercise.

 I didn't make Lent this year, I was already king of going mad from fasting regularly.  I started upping my proteins again and it really works wonders for the physique.  My whole body rebuilt itself over the last few weeks, I'm strong and full of energy again.  I'm eating about my lean body mass in protein, around 140-160g.  Liquid nutrients are a necessity in this if you can't eat all that good chow.  Exercising regularly you really do not need to fast, once you run out of fat stores, you may start crashing. I'm lactose intolerant so going on plant based proteins really fixed me up, ridiculous results and a unique burst of energy after a serving, unlike whey.  Whey made me bloated, I get a lean burst of energy with the veggie proteins.  

I haven't tried the meat one's, like the beef or deer proteins, those are rare now though.  My supplement shop seems to have quit carrying them before I was able to try them.  I'm not a big user of supplements either, mostly just the proteins and meal replacements.  I experimented with the testosterone boosters which are great, Fenu Greek is some powerful stuff for the hormones.  Fenu Greek will bring you to your knees foaming at the mouth for a piece of ass.  Be careful with that stuff, you may end up in the hospital having your prostate milked!  You have to milk your glands and you'll chill out.  A balanced diet should be more than enough to supply you with nutrients for body building, liquid nutrients are a necessity for some.  There's also nothing revolutionary about these protein shakes, we've had these for thousands of years.

I'm still learning and have a lot to study but I've been fasting regularly 5 years and my body is maintaining muslce with lite exercise and proper nutrition.  So I can both enjoy foods of whatever kind really, and not grinding at the gym.   I used to work out 6 days a week about twice a day, it was something else back then.  That was before I really settled down and learned about nutrition and all that, I was a bit old fashioned.  I typically drank lots of Pilsner and enjoying body building and whey protein.  

Routines very been lite - high rep and heavy - low rep.  The results seem to be relatively equal.  I'm not competing and my goals were just general fitness and functional strength, not breaking any records.  I lean more towards cardio as it helps my body flush out all the toxins and balances my hormones.  So like lite 2x12 lifting, 25-45 minutes typical cardio, jogging, HIIT, hiking.  I rarely go for longer endurance runs but those are fantastic...  I think the furthest I ever ran was 12 miles (19k)?  I'm not a strong runner, by the marathon standards of some of the folks on /r/running, I think some of those people are full of bologna.  I looked into ultra running, ultra marathons, that's ridiculous.

34,"I just feel like I have this emptiness inside of me, it's been there for what feels like forever. I have tried everything I can to fill it but nothing seems to work. 

I've tried men

I've tried science 

I've tried music 

I've tried art 

I've tried sports 

I've tried organization 

Nothing I do seems to fill this void inside of me and I don't know how to handle all the empty space. 

Every relationship I get into I latch myself onto this person, adapting their personality, never really having one of my own. I don't think I was able to come to this realization until I went to college. I was forced to be on my own, build my personality from the ground up. 

I feel like I don't have a passion and that's what kills me. I don't have a true love of anything. The one thing that I feel like I do enjoy, is helping other people. When I see I help then in a way I feel like it helps me. Seeing the gratification on someone else's face almost makes me feel the same way, but deep down I know that's not me feeling that. It's them.

I don't know how to process my feelings until it's almost too late. I sometimes feel like I'm still processing the death of my uncle even though it was years ago.  

Because my brain feels like it works slower than average, I never really know how to talk to people or share my thoughts and feelings. I'm always told that I need to communicate better, tell people how I'm feeling. 

How am i supposed to tell someone what I'm thinking or feeling if I can't figure it out myself.  

Is this because of how I was raised? 

Is this just in my DNA?

Will I ever truly be able to comprehend my world and process real emotions from it?

This emptiness really only bothers me during the winter. Could it be as simple as seasonal depression?

If so, why am I in so much emotional turmoil right now. 

I've been locked inside my house with my family. Yes we do have a nice house, with nice things. We don't have the threat of going bankrupt like so many families in this country right now. 

They want to put me on a schedule, all wakeup at the same time, all eat at the same time, all sleep at the same time. It's driving me crazy. In school I was able to do whatever I wanted on a schedule I designed. Not my OCD father. In school I was functioning, I got good grades, passed all my classes, kept everyone around me happy. 

Here at home though, I'm surrounded by constant stress and arguing. Corona or not. My brother and my father have never gotten along, their brains work too similarly and they both feel like they have to have the last word. 

Just the other day I got into a heated argument with a family member of mine, I took a shower to calm down. As soon as I step out of the bathroom, I'm greeted with yelling from downstairs. My father and brother arguing. Again. 

My dad has terrible OCD, everything has to be done his way or no way. He has admitted to everyone in the family that he knows he has OCD but refuses to seek help for it, instead he just takes it out on us. 

I'm supposed to be doing all my classes online, but I hate every second of it. My house is not the place where I should be doing work. There isn't a spot in here where I can focus. My schooling is suffering because my household won't condone it. 

At school, I could smoke and drink whenever and whatever I wanted, and honestly that was my way of coping with the stress of my workload. But now that I'm home and I have to figure out how to do all my work without being at school and in the school mindset? It's terrible? I don't know how to deal.",27Mar2020,1

36,"Okay so first off I want to say that this is not an everyday occurrence. It was really bad last month and then I was mostly fine, but isolation is kind of messing up my head again. For the actual feeling, the best way I can describe is like if a friend makes a joke and it's funny the first time but then they say the same joke over and over and you just want to scream at them to stop. But instead of a friend making a joke it's a thought in your head, and my mind is both parts at the same time. So one half of me is just like screaming pointless arguments and the other just wants everything to stop and be quiet. And it can get so bad that I just want to burst out into tears even though on the outside it looks like nothing's wrong. And usually, the subject isn't at all important. An example would be I couldn't remember if a fictional character wore earrings or had a mole and my head wouldn't be quiet unless I got a definite answer. And sometimes not even then. At one point the thought of an earring made me want to cry.

That's really only half of it though. I tend to overthink offhand comments into oblivion. It doesn't even half to be about me like I said earlier it could be if someone else wore an earring. But I just can't let go of the thought for days, sometimes weeks, on end. At it's worst the only time I won't think about it is when I'm asleep but from the moment my eyes open to the moment they close it's in my head. Sometimes it can even be physical, like one time I was rubbing at my throat until it was red or I just wanted to claw my skin off. Those are rarer though. However, when I'm deep in thought I'll find myself rocking back and forth.

Is this normal, does anyone else relate to this? If so do you know anything that can help alleviate the feeling?",27Mar2020,1

46,"Since graduating college last May, my mother made it very clear that I had less than a year to pack my bags and find my own place. I work an above minimum wage job, but my new rent and other expenses leave no room for me to afford a car so she still drives me to and from work, as we work together so it’s more convenient. 

This means that for the most part, my travel is limited to the one bus route that passes my apartment. So I feel trapped. 

On top of that my plans to have a roommate situation with my longtime romantic partner have fallen through, leaving me completely and utterly isolated in this new place. (Except for the days she visits me) 

I’ve got my cat which is nice, but I can’t help but think about how I could start self harming again and no one would notice or be there to stop me. 

I’ve been clean for over two years (at least in terms of traditional self harm) so it’s not likely, but the fact that I /could/ start again without repercussions has been bothering me to no end. 

The fact that I’m considered high functioning in my depression and anxiety also doesn’t help because I feel as though my family and friends don’t believe me/forget about it, because I’m not overtly displaying my illness via physicality, or Facebook vent posts.

51,"We only knew each other a shade under eight months. We were in a relationship for around five of them. And yet in that short span she became the best friend I've had in my 31 years, and the object of my affection.

When she called it off, I understood why she had to from her perspective. Her own mental health was declining between outside stresses and the stresses of a relationship. I had to accept a breakup that completely blindsided me.

For the last two months, I wake up every morning with a persistent headache and thoughts of her. In the daytime I've begun writing unsent letters to her instead of the things I actually need to do. I've had acute insomnia since the day it ended. 

I freaking just want her to be happy, and if us being apart is the road to that, then I don't to force us back together. I can't call her because she needs space more than anything. But I want to hear her voice make sarcastic jokes. 

It's more than just the pain of a breakup - everyone goes through those. It's become an obsession that dominates my thoughts 24/7. She's in my dreams. I'm worried about the elders her family during the COVID-19 crisis because I know just how fragile a person she really is, but I shouldn't be doing this; she needs space not reminders of our relationship. Friendship's not looking like an option from her side because she took the breakup hard too. 

It's not even about dating. I've got too many other priorities I need to be focusing on right now, but every single day is groundhog day where I just pine for her nonstop, and lament the fact that we're probably really, truly over. 

The real problem is that I can't focus on anything. I can't compartmentalize this at all. I sit down to work on my current project and it doesn't even take ten seconds before my mind wanders back to great memories of her. I already have ADHD and my hyperfocus is on a person who isn't even in my life.

I don't know if im messed up or what, I dont think I'm of higher intelligence or anything I just have no interest in anything they have to say because I don't care. it sucks because there are so many things i want to experience but it's hard to want to make memories and stay afloat with people when everyone else's souls are puddles instead of lakes. sorry if this is pretentious or shitty i dont know how to word it without coming across that way, i just wanted to know if anyone feels the way I do.",27Mar2020,1

But with the pandemic going on, I can't go out and I have big fears about going to the hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak. But I need to at least know that I'm not crazy for thinking I might have BPD. I thought I was just depressed, but I have noticed how overly emotional I am and how easily I react to situations to a point my friends are so used to my sudden emotional blow ups that they don't pay attention to it anymore. I remember an instance when they all went out to eat, and I wasn't able to go and even though they knew I couldn't go, they still went through with the plans and tagged me in pictures i was not in, I got so angry that I couldn't calm down for a few hours and I ignored them for days. I self harm, but I never knew why. Especially during times when fights happen, I get so sad or angry that I start harming myself, I punch myself and cut myself, i used to burn myself with bobby pins too, but I always end up feeling better right after even when i'm not mad at myself. It could be as simple as my family leaving me behind to go somewhere that leads me to feeling so angry I throw things and break things, once I had a boyfriend who didn't reply to me after a fight and I ended up throwing my week old phone and completely shattering the screen. There are times when i feel so upset that I spend almost half of my paycheck on clothes, shoes, and makeup to make me feel better. Sometimes I scare myself whe  I think about how I react about these things, but it's gone on so long that I'm used to it. I have trouble with relationships too, I always break up with boyfriends before anything starts to get serious and I tell myself it's because I'm not feeling interested in the relationship after a couple months, but I'm scared I'm just saying that so I have a reason to break up with them. I had a friend in college who I absolutely loved because that's how I am with my friendships, like I love everything about them and then after a very traumatic falling out, I tried to off myself. After that, I hated that person ever since, and I have felt nothing but hate for that person since. My family says I push them away too much and I've always felt they favored my brother, a lot of times I have felt that they take care of him more and have often left me to fend for myself when I was living away from home in college. I have a weird thing too when for example if my siblings are nice and loving, I love them and think they are the nicest people ever, but when we get into fights, all I can see them as are evil people who keep hurting me. When things start getting bad, it always feels lile the world.is against me, and when nothing is happening, I feel this constant empty feeling like I'm just passing through life without meaning.

I know it's crazy and the things I'm saying are way too by the book, but it's honestly how I've been dealing with things. I really hope someone can help me. My parents are very conservative catholic asians so they've never believed in mental health disorders and personality disorders so I've never been tested and have never been supported to get tested.

Abused alcohol to the point I was worried I am alcoholic, emotional eating to the point I gained 30 kg (around 60-70 pounds I think), hating myself for not being able to do something to change things for myself, skipping classes a lot, being distant and isolating myself, not showering very often, etc.

I've been going to therapy for about 8 months now. Things didn't change at once. 4 months ago I finally managed to reduce my drinking from a bottle of wime a day to a bottle of cider every saturday night. Then at some point I stopped drinking at all if it wasn't a special occasion. My relationship with my boyfriend improved, A LOT, we moved in together. And finally, a week ago I decided I would address my eating issues. It'e been a week of finally making each food decision consciously and not absent mindedly like ""it doesn't matter, I can't do it"". It's been such a long time since I felt like I had any control over that and I am so happy to be doing something for myself simply because: I decided to and I deserve it.

I started taking acutane, started taking adderall during the same period due to bad ADD I’ve always had, starting getting paranoid over noises and called cops twice for false alarms of someone being murdered and I’m getting ready to protect myself from them (weapons ready and everything), started getting a weird fascination with violent war and fight videos I shouldn’t have been watching as my past time, but not because I wanted to engage in it but because it’s so crazy you just can’t look away even if you want to type of things.  If stopped that now.  I’ve been pretty bipolar and people close to me (closest friends are my friends from afar and I only talk to them on the phone) have been pointing it out.  I’ve always been a pretty empathetic person and have been known for that by ppl close to me but lately I’ve lost it, this is alarming to me because I would get my way a lot of times because of the ability to sympathize with people so they would trust me, now because of me acting out I think I’ve lost that trust with ppl and now if I’m ever genuine they won’t trust me.  Why should they though?  I’m a pathological liar now.  Close members to me believe complete and utterly fabricated lies and I make them up on the spot, often to protect my image.  I’m manipulating others on a constant basis but that’s because they put me in bad situations.   I amaze myself sometimes with the things I pull off on naive ppl and they actually believe me. The difference is, as I used to have remorse for this stuff, I don’t anymore.  Literally I feel like the only empathy I have left is the empathy for seeing people and particularly animals in physical pain and suffering (even that’s a little lower) I always get especially mad at seeing people torture others and animals and have petty fantasies of getting back at them.  Don’t we all to some degree tho?  I don’t understand the suffering that comes from deceit, guilt, or the loss of someone close.  Logically I get, but not emotionally anymore if that makes sense. It’s I like forgot how to relate emotions to ppl in everyday circumstances if that makes any sense.  I’ve taken some tests that are telling me I’m a little but aspd scale but none are official.  I don’t want people to know that about me because what’s the benefit other than solving my curiosity?  I prob won’t ever get checked out for it unless it something forces me to.  I only ask and admit on here bc it’s Anonymous so no incentive to lie and I’m curious as anyone would be with a polar switch in their personality.  

In case your wondering I’ve only had a couple traumatizing life events:  
A deadly car accident at a red light when I was 9.  1 death, got PTSD pretty big time.  
Emotional and physical relationship trauma from a 2 1/2 relationship. 

Don’t want to bore anyone so questions just ask.  I’m trying to get to the bottom of this.  

TL;DR 

Took acutane and adderal to combat ADD and acne.  Also to help with depression 

Negative or ASPD character traits:
Compulsive liar 
Master manipulator
No empathy for deceit (it’s their fault they made me do this kinda ordeal) 
Can’t relate to simple emotions like anger 
Paranoia

Positive character traits:
Empathy for physical pain and suffering

Few traumas in my life

64,"Please I really need help or something I don’t really know 
I’m 21F and the last 7 months I’ve been in absolute hell. I just left my ex whom for the past 7 months I was living with. The relationship was horribly toxic. I have MDD DID  PTSD and severe anxiety I also have a past of drug abuse. After leaving my ex and frankly right before we got together my life has completely fallen a part not that I had much going for me in the first place. I’ve never felt as low and broken and insignificant as I do now and every single thing is hitting me at once and it’s hitting really hard and really fast. I have no friends absolutely none I moved back to my mothers which her and I have an absolute horrible relationship. I don’t know who to go to or what to do or anything. I don’t know anything anymore I don’t know who I am or what I want or what I need or what will help. I’m constantly crying and my mother is sick of it. I’m so close to the edge I mean all I can think about is hurting myself or frankly just killing myself im so sad and lonely and desperate. I’m craving drugs that I can’t get so in turn that’s becoming thoughts of self harm. I’m looking for comfort in meaningless sex I don’t know I don’t feel anything but sadness and hurt and I want to feel pain true pain or I want drugs to numb it all I can’t breathe I have at least 3 panic attacks a day and I just don’t know what to do.
My dad is supportive as hell and offered to send me to a residential place but frankly with all this Covid crap I can’t really go anywhere right now
I don’t know what to do",27Mar2020,1

66,"so about two years ago i moved back to my hometown looking for work. i reconnected with family i hadn't spoken to for years because of other family drama.  now when i get their i settle in to a tiny room and just try to work away at my job. so my mom and sister insert themselves into my life and get the whole "" you need help you need therapy. "" spiel. i've got help. it didn't help. at the end of the day some people are just to broken to be helped and i unfortunately am one of them. so that's why i generally just work bed repeat my days away.

so after being badgered and harangued for 2 two months , i finally agreed to go to ""therapy"" long story short it got loud the police came they broke my arm and nose and dragged me off. 

as usual nobody can just leave me alone. eventually i was released without charges. ( they went overboard for what was a suicidal tendencies call). my family brings out the worst in me. i look at them and see failure. mine. after all the dust settled they tried to get me to go to this program they had. i read the paperwork and it had power of attorney forms! 

My sister and the local mental health agency, were listed. I probably looked like a teakettle i was so mad. the realization that my sister was trying to basically enslave me! unlimited power of attorney, shed have control my finances, my medical decisions , my everyday autonomy. gone. because why? being a shut-in isn't good for me? you think i don't know that? but letting a PTSD stricken giant of a man wander around freely isn't safe for others! i know this too ! so for the better of all Ive been self isolating for ten years before corona!  i only leave my house for work or essentials ( and the gym i,id have killed some poor sob by now without it)

i confront her and of course no shock she tried to deny it but i know just what buttons to push to get my sister to talk. and when she admitted it i told her she was dead to me for this. i may not have much but i have my freedom and ill be damned before i let anyone ANYONE take that from me. this is where i did mess up and i threatened a child services visit. i believe the exact words were "" have fun watching cps load you son into their car from the back of a squad car.""  ( for the record i wouldn't actually have done that my nephew means more to me than life itself.) i just wanted to hurt her and i did i guess. 

My mother refused to even broach the subject . like somehow i cant possibly right when i accuse the golden child. i left town again shortly after. but it was too late , my PTSD got worse after this. i dont trust anyone. ANYONE. and when i do try to break out of this shell i get burned. every. damn. time.

at this point im just asking if i should give up or not? i started this in AITA but i guess it evolved.",27Mar2020,1
67,"I started online classes about a week ago, and have barely left the house since then. I went on a hike over the weekend, and had to go to the store yesterday for some necessities, but other than that, I've been cooped inside with the family members I live with. All my university classes have moved online, and I'm finding it incredibly hard to motivate myself to... care about anything. My classes feel unimportant and weirdly non-existent.

To add to that, my parents are getting a divorce (feel free to look at my post history to find posts about that situation) and the home I grew up in has been sold and we're moving all our belongings across the country to where I currently live and go to university (where I was born/where family is). Everything is rapidly changing and I feel like I'm losing touch with family and friends (definitely a lot of self-isolation going on there) as well as completely losing my motivation for normal life stuff.

Not knowing when this is all gonna be over with and life can resume as normal (if we interpret that as meaning corona goes away, since nothing in my life is gonna be ""normal"" again with my family and living situation completely changing) is completely ruining my mental state and I'm doing my best to cope but I feel like I'm going on a huge downward spiral right now. Really struggling to do life and feeling like a pathetic loser for not being able to just do my damn homework.",27Mar2020,1
68,"I don't think I have a mental disorder. I've heard stories and descriptions of what various illnesses feel like from other people and none of them match up with what bothers me. About a year ago I was depressed but it never came up again so I don't really know what caused it. And a lot of times I can function normally. But on the bad days it's just plain awful. My mind will be at a standstill and going 100 miles a minute at the same time. On a few occasions I have resorted to alcohol and the smallest cuts. Usually I try to avoid thinking about it and disassociate from stuff. But even when I think I need help, I can't work up the nerve to tell my parents there is something wrong with me. And I don't want to go through this humiliation and expensive thing for it to turn out to have been useless.",27Mar2020,1
69,"I've been suffering for several years from suicidal and harmful tendencies but recently (unrelated to Covid-19), they've been coming back stronger, every since the start of the year, I've become more hopeless but years ago my mother put a ban on my crying and ever since I have struggled immensely with expressing emotion and sharing. I've been seeing a school counsellor but every session I have has been empty talk about random things and never really anything that I've been meaning to talk about. 

Lately, I've been so desperate to self-harm and it's really taking a toll on me, especially now being home constantly I have full potential to do that at any point during the day. I have uncontrollable emotions and often have outbursts of anger and constant anxiety attacks that over time have begun to cripple me, I really don't know what to do. At this point, I want nothing but to die but something inside me doesn't want me too and I don't know what to do.

Does anyone have any recommendations?",27Mar2020,1

71,"I’ve asked so many people to hang out with me. I’m not good looking, I am annoying, and I’m really too hyper for most people. I can’t control if, it’s just me. I offer to pay for everything and maybe once in like two months someone actually does come and come and hang out. After that, they ghost and stop talking to me until I offer to pay again. I have some really good friends, but only talk to one on a regular basis and we haven’t every hung out irl. It really feels like no one gives a fuck about me or how I feel unless it benefits them. Sometimes even if it does benefit them they still don’t care. I’m over it. I am so sick and tired and sad of this shit. I literally fucking beg for anyone to be around me it’s so dumb.",27Mar2020,1

73,"Due to the coronavirus outbreak my boyfriend has done some research and now thinks he’s a professional on the subject. This means shoving every little negative detail about what’s gonna happen to society down my throat, cause he thinks that “it’s just facts, everyone should take it seriously”. i agree, but the online school and shutdown has made my anxiety so bad. i’m at an all time low having panic attacks every day and feeling like shit and i just need to be able to pretend and hope with the little hope i have left that everything’s okay, even just for a day. 

I have told him this while crying and almost breaking down in front of him but it seems like every time i try to be positive for my own health’s sake he needs to contradict me with “facts”. don’t get me wrong, i wouldn’t break up with him, i just think our ways of thinking clashes at this specific subject and i’m basically asking reddit; 

How do i get him to understand that the way he’s speaking about this is making me feel so much worse about the situation?",27Mar2020,1

76,"My girlfriend is amazing but she has serious mental health issues. She is diagnosed with general anxiety, social anxiety, depression, bpd, cptsd and probably more undiagnosed issues as well.

I have anxiety so I can understand her but only to an extent.

She does this thing where she gets upset easily, blames me for being mean to her when upon going over what I said in my head or rereading texts, nothing I said was out of line. Then she'll tell me she doesn't want to talk, delete me on Skype and whatsapp and not answer her calls but then hours later or the next morning, I'll be readded and she'll write a long apology telling me she was wrong and that she doesn't know how to not get upset but yesterday when this happened again, it felt different and today when I woke up, she didn't write me, although she did readd me on skype and whatsapp as i could see her last online.

Now it's literally over a day and she didn't write me which has me really confused. I wrote an apology despite me not having done anything wrong and she read it in the afternoon but no response. We only use Skype for each other and she has no one else added on there yet upon checking while I appeared offline because I didn't know what to think, I saw her checking several times yet she didn't reply. She even checked Skype at 2am all for about 5 seconds and then off.

I don't know what to do or if I wait it out, write her more to ask what's going on or what. I already wrote an apology that was quite long and told her she means the world to me and that I just want her to be happy. I live for her happiness as she is the most remarkable woman I've ever met with a heart of gold.",27Mar2020,1
77,"I had this friend who had family issues,they didn't live with her from the start,some months she was living with her relatives and some months she was in a hostel and when she did come back home they didn't give her a lot of time or attention or love.She was bullied at school at a younger age.Growing up as a teenager,she did a lot of self-harm,cutting her wrists and her thighs,trying painless ways of suicide using pills and chemicals.Then she started taking anti-depressants daily and cried herself to sleep most of the nights.When she started opening up about all of this,I didn't know what should be done I was a kid too, but I was willing to do whatever it takes to help her.Whenever she was low and called,I was always there on the other side for her.When she got her panic attacks,I took her aside from the crowd and held her hand throughout the process and tried my best to calm her.When she was talking to random guys who I knew weren't good for her,I tried to stop her but she never listened and almost always ended up being hurt.I know I had no right to tell someone who they should talk to,but I just didn't want her to be any more hurt than she already was.She always did the opposite of what I told her.When I realised that even I can't help her,I forced her to seek counseling and therapy.I bunked school to take her for her sessions because a close person was required to be present.I did everything a 16 year old kid could have done to help,and she was never grateful for any of it.And when on some days I needed someone to talk to,she wouldn't pick up my calls or tell me she's busy and later didn't ask how I was doing.When ever she got into a relationship,she didn't tell me for a long time but only after it was over and she was hurt and needed someone to talk to.She made her boyfriends her priority over me.I couldn't keep doing this,be in a friendship that wasn't benefiting me,so I clearly told her one day that I want us to go to being normal friends,but I'll still be here if you need me for your appointments or any other serious help,and she threw away her expensive medicines and tore her appointment sheet.It pissed me off so much that she couldn't see how much I did for her,cared for her.I felt guilty for a long time and it scared me that maybe she would take her life and then I wouldn't be able to live,so whenever she came crying to me or made a puppy face,I gave in.But slowly I cut off from her.Did I do the right thing or not?",27Mar2020,1
78,"I'm 27/male/arkansas. Most likely, not all of this is going to string together coherently, I will probably jump from one thought to another.

I've been everything besides happy since I've been an adult. I couldn't tell you all the reasons why, not without someone taking an interest and asking questions, forcing me to think about it. Most of my life I go without reporting anything about myself, my daily activities, my feelings, or anything at all to anybody. I've tried two therapists, it didn't help much; except when I was at my absolute lowest mood, and couldn't get suicide out of my head.

I grew up with a brother and sister, both were out of the house by the time I was 14. I spent tons of time with my brother when I was a kid. I hardly talk to him now. I talk to nobody, ever. And I feel like nobody wants to talk to me anyways. One of the things that frustrated me about therapy was that I never felt welcome to just talk about my past. If I shared a story, they would just say 'well, that's interesting, but let's talk about how you can improve your life right now'. 

I feel like I have countless things bothering me very badly. And, I think it might not be normal to go months without talking more than a few sentences to only two or three people. I live with my mom because I couldn't afford to make it on my own with my last job, which I lost in January. Her and I have almost nothing in common and usually it just annoys me to talk to her. I feel like nobody has taken an interest in me in I don't know how long. I really don't remember the last time anybody was interested about anything I had to say.

I feel shitty sharing this. My first assumption in the response I would get is 'Of course nobody gives a shit about anything you think or say.' Maybe that's the way I feel about almost everybody else. I have felt ever more angry at other people and the world in general as more and more time goes on. I feel like a lot of things were taken from me and that nobody has ever cared. I grew up in the Jehovah's Witness religion which is nothing beyond a cult. (I'm an atheist/agnostic now) So I was raised outside of almost every normal aspect of culture that every other child gets to experience; like holidays. My niece died when I was 18, she was 8 months old. My father died right before I turned 23. I feel like every single job I've held has treated me like shit compared to most people in the workforce. 

I feel like nothing brings me any happiness at all anymore, and I don't know how to move forward past it. This coronavirus has brought me excitement more than anything. Seeing so many people take things I didn't have for granted finally losing them makes me feel vindicated. As a small child my family lived in a camper without power or water. In 2009 we lost power and water in my area for a month and it didn't bother me at all compared to everyone around me. I already struggle to eat once a day, and I would elect not to eat at all if I didn't have to. So going hungry in a catastrophic event also doesn't make me flinch. I've already eaten more wild caught or grown food than most people in the US, and know if it came to that I wouldn't have any issue acquiring food. I feel like the best life I could have is during a catastrophe. At least then, I would have a reason to tell myself why I don't have anyone to ever talk to.

I'm mad at the world, and I don't expect anyone to ever care.",27Mar2020,1

81,"Hey everyone, these thoughts have been eating at me for quite some time and I can't quite seem to shake them regardless of what I do so I thought I'd share them. My apologies on the length (*﹏*;)

For context, I'm 19 and from a generally small town. I'm going to school and studying secondary education with a social studies focus (high school social studies teacher), and an aspiring esports hopeful who plays Super Smash Bros., and I've experienced symptoms of severe depression and OCD for the last 6 years, and have fought suicidal thoughts for the last 4 years. I also used to be in a terribly toxic relationship where I was emotionally, mentally and slightly physically abused (thankfully have been out of it for a year plus). The reason I say symptoms is because I haven't been diagnosed or to a proper doctor to be diagnosed/find out truly what is wrong with me. I've seen counselors on my college campus, talked to close friends and whatnot, but never told my family or sought out a professional.

Anyways, recently I've just felt unmotivated and drained. I sleep in way too late and go to bed way to late (in bed by 4 AM, up by noon or 1 most days). Nothing I do gets me excited or makes me truly happy anymore and with recent quarantines for COVID-19 I've been finding myself hating myself more and more each passing day. I can't bring myself to do much schoolwork, I don't eat some days and over eat other days, I don't work out as much as I used to or should, and seem to live the routine of wake up, be unproductive, go to bed. It's hell. I hate every second of it and the only slight relief I have is some friends over Xbox and in a Discord server I run for my Smash friends, but even then I still feel useless and tired all the time.

Most people I bring up my issues to (friends, relationships, etc.) is met with dismissal, being taken advantage of and all around negativity. I've got a big heart and sadly it does thinking for me at times not so opportune. I just feel like I've got nowhere to really go with this, which lead me to here typing this out at 4 AM, trying to think of a way to wrap this up that's not so sudden and awkward. Regardless, if you got to here thanks for the time, I hope you're taking care of yourself during this rough and strange time, and that you have an awesome day, night, afternoon, etc.",27Mar2020,1
82,"(Warning! what your about to read may be triggering!)

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't born normal...I was born prematurely as well as a hermaphrodite, my mother was a religious woman and my father was a man with a rough past...

When i was born i had to be put in an incubator, (or under a hamburger lamp as my older sister said.) and two month's passed before i was allowed to be held. now at the time the doctor bought me to my birth mother she wanted nothing to do with me because she said that i was ""an unholy abomination.""  but my older sister who was around two to three years at the time was apparently hypnotized at the sight of me in my father's arms (or so my dad says).

&amp;#x200B;

Now i was tiny as heck around then even after being in the incubator, i was originally born 2 lbs and 2 ounces!  but anyways...

&amp;#x200B;

Almost four years go by as i soon became a toddler and my mother kicked my dad out of the house and forced him to stay away from me yet be able to see my sister...my mother kept me hidden away in the basement because of my gender...my sister being six was able to see my dad and tell him about me and the fact that my mother wouldn't let me out of the basement to play with my sister...luckily my mother went to work and left us with a baby sitter that would let me out of the basement and feed me before returning me to the basement...

&amp;#x200B;

Now around that time there was an old television that was hooked up to some old kids channels from when my mother used to let my sister watch tv...that television was one of my few connections to the outside world and there was one channel i had on whenever my mom was either at work or asleep...that channel had some old tv shows like transformers animated or even the retro transformers from what i remember...(i had a hand me down kids camera that i still have to this day that holds pictures of the tv) now...even though my mother worshipped god she also had a lot of guys come in and out of her house...most of them never knew of my exsistence...

But one day i remember a man coming down to the basement followed by my mother's voice...i remember vividly what she said while i laid on the cold dirty cement basement floor...""once your done with it you will give me the money."" i didn't know what she quite meant until i was 11 when the memories flooded back...that was the night that man raped me...

&amp;#x200B;

Years went by as more and more men came and went through my mothers house, many of them paying my mother to use me like a toy or a punching bag...my body was so frail and weak...i don't even know how i survived.

&amp;#x200B;

By the age of 9 i had grown used to the physical and emotional abuse i was put through, my sister did try to stop my mother and those men from hurting me but in the end she was locked away in her room while i was left to defend myself at the greedy hands and fists of both my mother and those men...

&amp;#x200B;

I soon found out from my sister why my mother did what she did...

&amp;#x200B;

Drugs...from heroin to cough syrup...she did it all...

&amp;#x200B;

Now i did go to school but my mother threatened me that if i ever was to eat or speak a lick of anything of what she did to me she would end my life the second i stepped foot in the house...and i listened...I listened because i knew my life depended on it...i was bullied throughout grade school due to the fact that i was skinny, had freckles and always wore pants and turtle neck sweaters...a lot of the time my sister would step in and defend me but there were times where i was utterly alone...i'd return home with wounds varying from cuts, bruises, scrapes and even a couple broken bone at times.

&amp;#x200B;

I always bandaged my wounds with scraps of cloth from my old clothes and when it came to resetting my bones back into place i did that all on my own...because no one else would do it for me...

&amp;#x200B;

funny enough as soon as i started getting bullied i soon learned how to fight back, which caused my mother to move me and my sister to 18 different schools.

&amp;#x200B;

And throughout those years of living in my mothers basement my sister learned how to sneak food and water in so i wouldn't starve...yet even though she did her best i was still almost skin and bone...i was a tall kid growing up yet i was a twig...

&amp;#x200B;

My mother continued her abuse towards me...her words cutting just as deep as her belt did...

I look at my scars to this very day and weirdly enough...i laugh at how i could easily take a beating...

Summer vacation soon comes and my sister soon gives me the news that we'll be going to our step sisters house, little did i know my life would change within the next year...

Days go by as my mother forces me to pack up what little belongings i had and put them in the car with my sisters things before we drove up into the big city and to my step sisters house.

We soon arrive and my mother and step sister talk while my sister helps me bring my things inside before i noticed a small little boy with olive brown skin like my sister no older then two was crawling around my step sisters house as a four year old girl with long messy dirty blonde hair ran after him...i soon found that the two little crotch gremlins were my niece and nephew!

After i unpacked my things i heard the sound of my mothers car peeling out of the parking lot, leaving me and my sister alone with my step sister and her two children.

Things started of great...i got fed a little more and bathed every night (though i was still underweight), i even got to go swimming and get to know my niece and nephew...

Things were great...until i was prescribed a new drug...(I almost forgot to mention that I've been on ADHD meds and other meds for my health since i was six) that newly prescribed drug worked perfectly fine while i was taking it but...the withdrawal effects that came once they ran out caused something in my brain to snap and make uncontrollably angry, paranoid and depressed.

I always listened to my sister until the day the meds had fully withdrawled from my body...i was almost animalistic in some words...

But i was soon calmed after i was given the teddy bear that i often slept with growing up and everything went to normal for a while...

I soon noticed that my mother hadn't returned to retrieve me and my sister from our step sisters house and it made me somewhat happy in some way...

A year goes by as i'm on the prescribed pills when suddenly their once again all gone and i quickly go into withdrawals and grow extremely aggressive...but this time my step sister restrains me...but not for long as i soon escape and run out of the house and out of the neighborhood...

&amp;#x200B;

Once again my world does a 360...

&amp;#x200B;

Within the next three hours of leaving my step sisters house i am captured by both police and paramedics before being rushed to the nearest hospital and kept there for three weeks on foods with lots of minerals and vitamins as well as IV fluids, once i'm let out i'm taken into a foster home and over the next week i stay inside my room.

After the week my sister is brought into the same foster home as mine and we share a room together...

Things get much better and i was taken off of those med and put on some easier medication, my foster parents were kind and happy for us to be in their care for what would be an entirety of two years...

The two years goes by as me and my sister continue to go to grade school until she graduates into high school...and the person i cherished most will soon be torn away from me in the blink of an eye....

October 1st comes as my day starts off normal as i make plans with my sister to go to the town library after school, i eat breakfast before rushing out of the house.

The school day goes by normally and soon it was home time, i quietly walk home alone until i make my way up to my house and inside...

The smell of potato soup with carrots,celery and bits of chicken was supposed to be the dinner i would eat with my sister that night.

I did my usual routine of cleaning the cat litter before washing my hands and walked towards the room me and my sister shared, i creaked open the door and looked at the silhouette of who i knew was my sister.

I can't say what happened next but...my sister was taken to a hospital on life support...

The doctors told me she didn't have enough oxygen getting to her brain but her heart was fine...

That same day i watched them pull the plug on someone i loved and grew up with...

its been almost six years since her death and i just finished high school and I've been to 7 foster homes, over 20 schools and have learned about who i want to be and what will happen next...

fear? It honestly doesn't bother me anymore, I'm moving out of my last foster home once the quarantine is lifted and hopefully within the next few years i either move to the states to be with my husband or he moves here.

I have eventually have gotten to see my birth mother again and quickly stopped seeing due to her abuse towards me starting back up just because i told her i started taking testosterone.

I've gotten to meet my father and get to know him luckily,he's very understanding.

But anyways... What the hardest thing that doctors have labeled me with over the years is chronic depression, chronic suicidal ideation, chronic body pains and finally chronic anxiety and PTSD.

Having a chronic illness means to have it for the rest of someones life, they'll have it every day and sometimes it gets bad while other times its eases up.

I try my best not to cut and burn myself just so i can feel any other pain that i feel each and every day, most recently I've been very successful at preventing myself from acting on these urges.

I also suffer from severe insomnia and S.I.S (also known as stress induced seizures.)

&amp;#x200B;

I don't socialize with people too much IRL as i have severe social anxiety, yet i somewhat feel at ease using social media to vent...

anyways...I have been up for way too long and just need to get this off my chest, i'll take my meds and hit the hay before morning arrives.

i'll post and update in a few months but until then goodbye!",27Mar2020,1

86,"Honestly, i dont really know where to start, or even if this is the correct reddit to be posting about this , i made a throwaway account because im shy i guess. Prepare for a long one (but dw ill put a TLDR at the end, and prepare for some mention of gaslighting, and overal manipulation).

Ive been spending these quarantine days watching/reading some light romcom or romantic drama series' and while it makes me happy to read because its cute, i always find myself upset that im currently 21 and not in a relationship. I havent been in a relationship for about 3-4 years now ever since my last one fell out real bad. I feel like it shouldnt affect me as much because it was an online relationship, I was young and stupid at the time and thought it would work out, however, the relationship was extremely toxic, on both ends. I want to say that I hope I wasnt the one who started it, but honestly i dont even know anymore. From what I can remember, he was toxic to me first, beginning with the pressure of sexting which i originally did not consent to, but with enough pressure, i caved. And every problem that i can recall wound up that way because i was so tired and didnt want to argue, even if i didnt want to send anything, i did it because i wanted his attention, otherwise he would get mad and tell me i really didnt love him at all, and would ignore me. 

He would also find ways to get mad at me (ex: hacking into my accounts to read my messages to others from even years back, and bring them up just to fight with me. or he would take a sentence i said to someone out of context and twist the meaning, even though i swore that wasnt what i meant he would insist, or say that i told something malicious to him with the intent to hurt his feelings. after enough pressure i would always eventually cave and tell him ""ok, youre right, im sorry""), or take his family issues out on me. Regardless, I would always relent and say 'im sorry"" even if the original problem wasnt my fault. I used to argue to try and defend myself but realized it was useless, and fell back into apologizing. Jealousy was also a huge problem, as i cut off a lot of guy friends in high school, because he didnt like that i was hanging out with guy friends platonically, calling me a sl\*t or saying i was sleeping with all of them, even accusing me of sleeping with my coach because i had his number in my phone to contact (no. I never texted my coach ever. unless i was arriving to a location for a tournament, or leaving said location. but that didnt matter. his issue was that I had his phone number in the first place). Eventually, his behavior also started to effect me, and id developed an attitude of ""if HE can treat me this way, or say/act a certain why, why cant i?"" which i know looking back on is a huge mistake and i never should have acted that way. I should not have mirrored his behavior. Period.

I know you all are probably thinking ""well why didnt she just leave? it was an online relationship she couldve easily blocked and moved on"". Part of the reason at the time was he would always threaten suicide when i would try to break up with him, so our relationship would constantly be ""broken up"" and ""back together"" later that week. I was terrified that he would kill himself. And that aside, i genuinely believe it was a mental power struggle as well, which is why i could never fully stick to my decision of a breakup. he would tell me that he was the only one who would ever love me as much as he did, and as a teen, i wholeheartedly believed it. 

2 years into the relationship, he broke up with me for ""being a wh\*re"" (when id never slept with anyone in my life) and we went our separate ways for good. I fell into a deep depression as I'd centered my life around making him happy and him throwing me away after that was heartbreaking, but i am proud to say i was able to get out of that depression with the help of some super supportive friends who have been with me for so long. Honestly, without those people, im sure i would have spiraled out of control to an even worse mental state.

My ex definitely left a huge impression on me and my mentality towards relationships (only the ones that include myself. I fully support my friends and their relationships! I love seeing my friends in loving and healthy relationships). I have a lot of trouble getting close to people more than skin deep (as in i can get along with just about everyone), but i really cant bring myself to get personal or truly share important things about myself without feeling weird. And i certainly have the hardest time with the dating scene as i automatically associate myself with a bad relationship and the abuse i faced, and have a hard time believing men can genuinely be interested in me without the intention of sex only. (i know not all men are bad, but i guess im just scared of a relationship???). it has been 3 years since my breakup and am still suffering the mental trauma of being abused. I have been in denial about my issues all this time since im not in the same depression i was before, but have come to the conclusion that maybe i need help. 

Would i benefit from going to counseling/therapy even though I waited this long to finally acknowledge my problems in full? I know some have it worse than me, and wouldnt like to take away time from people who need it more than me. (my thought process:  why do i need to go to therapy now when i lasted this long without it?)

87,"I've grown up with him since we were little kids but since the quarentine I realized these things

1) He always gets into situations where I have to lie for him (this has been going on continuously).

2) He sent drunk videos of me to random people without my consent. I only found out because his other friend (who I became great friends with now) told me and his excuse was simply ""don't worry he already knew."" I didn't, but I said I did. Btw he kept encouraging me to get drunk, this was the first time I even got drunk, so I hadn't expected it to be like that.

3) He told awkward explicit details about my sexual life to a girl he just started talking to. 

4) I got caught with weed (wasn't even my idea to do it in his house, I warned him) by his mom. Some of the evidence was directed towards me, I chose to take all the blame, he barely defended me. His mom who I knew all my life clearly hates my guts right now, but he either doesn't notice it or doesn't care and he still invites me to his house as if it's all normal.

5) This is unrelated, but he steals holiday money from his own brother's work where he also works at. 

6) He constantly makes me wait out in the cold for him to pick me up.

7) Unrelated, but he lies about going to college to his mom for years now. My mom compares me to him how he works hard and goes to college to this day. I'm having a hard time finding a job because of my ACTUAL college schedule, but I never snitch on him.

8) He only responds to my texts super late at night, when he's done doing whatever he's doing; to meet up with me and play games. OR, he responds when he's completely free to spend the whole day with me or needs my help.

9) Unrelated, but he cheats on all of his girls. Sadly, he makes me befriend them and because I knew him longer I feel the urge to be loyal to him and not tell the girls. At one point I thought he'd change and he still cheated on a really nice girl. The girl was more in shock that I hadn't told her, but I geniunely didn't expect it that time. I even had told her she was like a sister.

10) Remember when I said he sent drunk vids of me? Well, one time I uploaded a perfectly good pic of me and him where I even praised him and put myself down and he within literally a few seconds told me to delete it to preserve his image I assume.

These are most of the bad things I can recall at this moment. Let me know if you guys want to know the good things, but I just want to know if these things are bad enough alone to not be good friends. Keep in mind I've been friends with him my whole entire life, and I looked at him like family. One more thing, is that he makes a ton of promises he doesn't keep or it's half-assed. He'll say ""I'm going to back in 2 hours,"" and comes back in like 6-7 hours or even more. If you guys need more details on any of them I'll tell you that too as best I could without getting too specific.",27Mar2020,1
88,"I am a 16 year old male.  

This past two weeks I’ve lost interest in everything I used to enjoy doing.
I no longer feel like riding ATVs, playing video games, watching tv, etc 

I’ve been pretty down as well and basically just sitting in bed all day on Instagram, I haven’t had the motivation to do much else.
I run a political page on “politigram” and I’m in a lot of group chats which is why I’m usually on there.
It is a nice way for myself to be heard and where I can give my opinions 

I am very socially isolated and lonely since I am no longer on speaking terms with one of my few friends so this seems like the only way I can get social interaction.
On an average day in the past two weeks I probably spend 7 hours a day just doing that.

According to my family I’ve also been very distant, easily aggravated, etc.

89,"I (15m) have always had a type of paranoia about being watched as I'm sure most do but it recently has become increasingly worse. I can't be on my main floor of my house past dark without constantly either believing that I am or could be watched at that moment or I am thinking of all the different places I could be being watched from, sometimes (not mainly though) both. I avoid windows at night and screen cameras always (unless I am actively using them). For example I went to my kitchen to get something to drink but all I was doing was looking everywhere around me because even though it's just my backyard with a hedge and and empty lot past that behind the glass, I am thinking ""just because you can't see out doesn't mean they can see in"". When it's not windows it's electronics. When I was little it was stuffies eyes or mirrors. Constantly thinking there are cameras. Scarred something I do in and empty room with the windows covered will somehow leak into the world or my family or friends and it's become excessive. As I type this I am looking over my shoulder to make sure there's no one at my second story window. I think it's just all the things my uncle's and brothers told me when I was young and impressionable really sinking it's teeth into me and holding on for dear life here but I'm so sick of it all.

90,"My situation is kinda fucked. Very fucked compared to the situations that my “friends” (they are the closest I have to friends right now) come to me with as the source of their problems and worries. But I’ve always been a very empathetic and caring person, and in turn have always been very sympathetic and supportive. I’ve always been big on the idea that pain is relative, and no matter how small someone’s issue is, if that’s the worst they’ve been through then it hurts them in a similar way that the worst pain I went through hurt me. I’m sure I acted like it was the end of the world when I went through my worst pain just like they are.

However, lately, I’ve only felt annoyed and frustrated when people come to me with their problems. Maybe it’s because I’m coming off of all of my medications for the first time in years and my emotions are very different now because of it, but whatever the cause, this is a very new and sudden emotion to me, and I feel guilty for feeling it. I don’t show it to them because I know it’s wrong to dismiss and invalidate their emotions, but honestly I’ve been getting pissed off when they come to me with their stupid and fickle issues, saying how horrible it is for them. They need to just suck it up and get the fuck over it. I don’t pity them. I envy them. I wish so much to be in their situation, that my worst problem has such a small impact on my whole life. 

And now I feel completely hypocritical and all woe-is-me, because am I in the worst situation? Fuck no, it could definitely be so much worse. I’m sure a lot of you could tell me to suck it up and get the fuck over it. And I feel guilty for being so harsh to people in my head, when I’ve always been so kind and understanding.

Sorry this is so unorganized and unprocessed. I’m just very confused and overwhelmed with my strange new emotions. I don’t even know what I’m looking for from posting this. Validation? Help understanding it? Just what do you think of this? Am I turning into an asshole? Idk. Thanks.",27Mar2020,1
91,"I (M21) think i got a pretty good life. I've got a bunch of friends, a family that I'm either not to far or to close with them, got some average grade at school, got an average jobs, got some life project but not to many, got some passion but I'm not crazy about them either. The only thing that I think I lack is relationship.

But that's driving me crazy. I know deep deep inside that it's only a question of time until I become alone. All my friend are the anti-social type and they are all over 24 so they all slowly start ton enter the 30. Even now (before covid-19) my only social activity are 2 D&amp;D game a week. I don't said that bad but, that not how I will meet someone new.

I have also try online meeting but I don't have enough sex-appel to make myself a play on that scene. And don't ask for the bar, even if I'm a big fan of craft beer, my friend aren't the social type so I always end up going alone a the bar. but that no big of a problem, I know a lot of people thanks of being a taxi driver in my little town for 15 months. so when I go to the bar a lots of people come talk to me for like 10 to 15 minutes  and after they pass to another call. At the end, I always end up alone at the counter with my beer.

In result, I've got a lot of time to think about myself, and that never a good thing when your depress. In those introspection moment I've came to one conclusion. All the thing I do, I do them to kill some time, forgot that I'm alone, preventing myself to think. I've recently observe that I lissent to music so loud that it prevent myself to think. All the thing I do are to make tome go faster until I die. I'm not even capable of enjoying them on the long terme. And if I lose them, it doesn't bother me that much.

Sadly, the only reason that I haven't kill myself a this hour and date is because I'm in the ''mom would cry'' phase. And that just a phase. The days when it will pass, will probably be my last one.

That crazy because lot of people are in a way worst position that me but they are way happier than me because they have fate. Fate in their future ''Maybe some day it will get better''. And I know that the good way of thinking but my fking over logical ass keep saying myself that my chance are as high than a loto ticket and all people should know that believing in our lotto chance is a one moment trip, not a way of living. But at the same time, that the good way of thinking because that the way to stay alive. And I understand that too, but I'm always tear between those two and that so exhausting.

92,"Hello,

it lasted about 24 hours and it was the only occasion something like this happened.

&amp;#x200B;

Included: 

\- persecutory delusions (I was conviced, for some reason, that my friends had drugged me, were part of a drug ring and every little unrelated thing just deepened the idea. I've also believed that people on the bus somehow conspired against me, followed me just to make fun of me and mock me.)

\- visual hallucinations (seeing smoke come out of my mouth, seeing evil faceless shadowy figures at night, seeing one of my friends on TV)

\- auditory hallucinations (I've heard snippets of conversations from strangers that were pertaining me or my friends.)

\- tactile hallucinations (I constantly had a feeling someone was touching me.)

&amp;#x200B;

Besides this, I've never experienced any breaks from reality.

The only thing I've ever been diagnosed with is Asperger's. I do have a mental illness history- particularly depression, social anxiety and self-harm, I've been admitted to psychiatric hospital twice in my teens.

So, my main question is, can this happen to a person who doesn't have a psychotic disorder? I've never talked about it to anyone, but I'm afraid of eventually snapping again. My own brain betraying me like this was the scariest experience in my life. I wonder if keeping quiet about it and not seeking any psychiatric help was a mistake.

Some people get worried, some people laugh, some people relate. It doesn’t matter. As long as I’m joking about things going on they seem less serious so they cause less stress. Maybe this is a bad idea for the long run but I’m just focusing on staying alive right now. I know that acting like my mental health is a light an casual subject helps me deal with it, so I do that.

For obvious reasons it happens the most when I’m laying down in bed with my eyes closed but it still happens a lot; I could be showering, I could be playing a video game, I could be doing schoolwork and my it’ll happen.

100,"Why don't I fit anywhere? My entire life, it's been glaringly obvious to everyone around me that I just don't fit. Most people that are close to me deny it because they think it would hurt my feelings if they told me the truth. But honestly, it would just set me free to know that I'm not just insane. Because for my entire life I've known, at least to some degree, that I'm not meant to be here. I *know* that. I don't think I'm some higher being or anything, but I know I wasn't meant to be alive.

I'm incapable of having functional, long lasting relationships of any kind, I can't even talk to most people without obviously making them feel uncomfortable. It took me a while to learn that, but over the years the amount of uncomfortable, awkward interactions I've had, the amount of people who have left me, or have been with me but obviously felt stuck, and the amount of my close family members that just don't want to ever be in a conversation with me has taught me about myself.

 Once I realized this, I tried to make a presentable version of myself, but it doesn't really work, and I never feel like me. I can't really 'turn it off' though, so in almost every interaction I have with people outside of my home, I feel like I'm behind an impenetrable mask. I literally can't express any emotion except happiness when I'm out of my house, and I'm never really happy, so I'm just constantly faking it.

So yeah, I'm that one person that you start talking to and just want to leave. I tend to be more 'normal' online, but if you met me in real life you'd understand. Most of the time I avoid meeting or talking to others because it just fills me with intense anxiety and self hatred.

And it's not just my incapability to have any social interaction. It's also that my brain is fighting against me every hour of every day, and I live at the whims of whatever it's trying to do to me. I can't think freely at all. I'm constantly being policed by myself and judged. Everything I do, say, think, is scrutinized. I don't know if my emotions are completely fake or not, and a lot of them feel foreign or forced. There's certain things I'm not allowed to do or believe. I think about the same things over and over again every day. 

I am constantly being attacked by myself. I'll find something I hate, something I don't want to think about at all, and think about it constantly, then feel guilty, ashamed, or I'll end up making myself paranoid which can get very bad. Every time I think something, I'll end up hating myself for thinking it. Every time I actually feel happy or enjoy something, my brain is there to ruin it for me. And the more I fight against this, the worse it gets and the worse I feel, so most of the time I live my life tiptoeing everywhere and feeling stressed and worried.

I also hate myself. Everything about myself. The way I look, the way I talk, the way I behave. I hate that I'm a coward, that I'm weak, lazy, and fat, that I have no social skills, that I have no talents. I feel worthless, a waste. I annoy myself almost as much as I annoy others. I hate myself so goddamned much that I'm not really surprised that other people hate me too. At least that's something we have in common.

I feel very lost. I barely have a personality, and I can't really define what's me and what's the mask anymore. I have absolutely terrible memory, and I live in a brain fog, so I feel like I'm just drifting from one thing to the next. I've always felt uncomfortable and wrong in my own skin. I get really stressed out about it, I never feel right, most of the time I feel naked around others. I've never even found clothes that I'm comfortable in. I usually revert to esecapism, self harm, and alcohol to feel good. Most of the things I used to enjoy I stopped caring about. Some things I just feel too worthless and dumb to carry on doing.

I don't really have anyone that I love, I'm not even sure that I can feel it because most of the people I should love, I don't. Most of the time I think that life isn't even real. I constantly think about ending my life, and I've gotten very close, but the worst I've ever done is a few small slits in my wrist and standing on the edge of a cliff. I just don't feel like I was meant to be here. Something about me is wrong, and I feel that I'll never really be living as long as I'm like this. I'm in constant stress and pain, and I feel worn out from it. I don't see any reason to continue being alive, and although I probably won't kill myself in the short term, it's my life goal. 

Anyway, thanks for reading this far if you have, this was just a bit of a nonsensical rant about my life. I'm sure that since it's so long it's going to get mostly ignored, but I don't mind. I just wanted to put a few of my issues into words.",27Mar2020,1

I fear I may lose my job and have no money to pay rent and my family is at risk of the virus cause one of family members had contact with someone who just tested positive. I feel so left alone and like I can't even ask for help cause I'm just crazy and dramatic. I fear the virus but at the same time I'm almost like oh well at least that's an easy escape.

And going back with this girl, she was planning to go out for work outside the country, and she would eventually left me, but not saying goodbye, just giving us a time for our future, but I knew this was not going to work, I knew her, and she cannot stand this kind of relations, the distance ones. So, after a great love story, we broke up, and I know it is impossible to come back with her, so I just had to move one.

This is the problem, I just can't forget her, she is so important for me, she filled a place in my heart, she helped me with my anxiety, with another problems I had, she was an angel, she was always worried about me and my health, we had a lot of things in common, but now, I'm all alone now, and in times like this, I just sleep and play videogames, those are my only distractions of my shitty story and my shitty life.

It's got me thinking; everyone has different experiences with their mental health and what they find most challenging to deal with. 

  
Personally, the biggest frustration is not being able to concentrate when I'm feeling depressed. It means that I'm never able to escape the way that I feel as I can't take my mind elsewhere - I hate it! I try to remind myself that it will soon pass - it always does - and that I shouldn't beat myself up about it. But, it's tough when you're in that moment.

108,"Yeah so as far back as I can remember, my dad has just been a completely self absorbed dick head who thinks he’s the next best thing since sliced bread and will go through some legit narc rage every now and then for stupid fucking reasons and I dont know what to do. 

He’s not the type of narcissist who genuinely believes he’s as great as he props himself up to be either, he’s the type where when you say one tiny little thing that shatters the illusion he’s built for himself he’ll go apeshit and threaten to kill you and beat the shit out of you and blah blah blah. If I had a nickel for every time he has done this, I could probably pay off my student loans.

My mom doesn’t really have any problems with him and genuinely loves him despite his constant disrespect and mistreatment, which makes it pretty difficult for me to open up to my family about how I feel about this guy. What I do feel for him is nothing but pure hatred and disgust. I have had to put up with this guy and his behavior for so long now that whenever someone mentions his name or brings up something that reminds me of him all I can think about is killing him tbh (not like Im actually gonna do that). 

I honestly don’t know what my mom sees in him and even my friends agree with me. I constantly dread coming home from college every weekend because I know that at some point im going to have to put up with my dad, and the thought of that is fucking torture for me. I know it sounds dramatic but I feel trapped in my house whenever he’s around, and whenever he is around im constantly looking for an excuse to get out of the house for a long period of time like sleeping over at my friend’s house. 

This quarantine kinda might be really bad for me in the near future because I dont know if my dad is capable of not losing his mind being locked up in the house all day, but I dont want to stick around to find out. So in conclusion, I hate my dad and I have no way of actually getting out of this situation for a while.

109,"Hey.

I've had problems before with self talk telling me I'm worthless. I'd say not as much anymore, but I'm not sure if whether what I'm about to describe is related to them in some way.

I realised for the past maybe 2 months or so, every day I get into this specific state where I literally can't think without it hurting. I like listening to music, but when I do, kind of no matter what the music is, upbeat or chill, I can't focus on the words or get myself to fill up my headspace with it. Because I get a dull aching pain. Not physical but more like mental. Like how sometimes when you have the flu, your whole body and your bones and your muscles kind of hurt just by existing, and when they move. But this is more like my mind doing the same thing. I can't watch movies. I can't reflect on things too much. I put on my headphones, put on a song, change the song with no effect. Silence is also kind of painful.

These past few days I notice every day there is a point where I can only exist on autopilot, because concentrating on any one thing is painful. This pain isn't too overwhelming, but it's regular and deep enough for me to notice, and also notice it's making me less productive and more easily overwhelmed. Handling stressors is becoming difficult.

My whole life, I came more and more to the concusion that a really important habit to do is to focus on things. Focus on emotions- if you start feeling something, focus on the emotion, discern exactly what it is, remember how it feels, think about why I'm feeling like that. I try to focus also on thoughts and ideas- when one pops into my head, I try to put it into language, define terms, evaluate it. No discrimination between things- whatever I'm feeling or thinking at the time, focus on it. It has been my belief this is how someone becomes wiser, more curious, more well rounded and more empathetic.

I feel like I'm losing that curiosity because now it hurts to practice this habit of focus.

Writing this, I had a low pain in the back of my head.

Am I just more sensitive than other people? Is this a form of exhaustion? Is it just a more stressful time in my life?

112,"Hello all,

So, recently as my previous posts show, I have been living the last few weeks with the whole obsession about developing schizophrenia. Since the very start I took an anxiety attack for about 2 weeks solid about 2 years ago. I had never felt anything like it before. Until I went onto the big beautiful internet 😂 I came across intrusive thoughts, weird and horrible anxiety stories and then I came across schizophrenia. From then on I have been riddled with fear of developing it. I’ve went from worrying about MS, BI polar, schizophrenia, cancer and lastly questioning absolutely everything and making up the worst case scenarios in my head. I’ll give you a few examples. I’ve had a range of schizophrenia fears and obsessions all because I honestly have sat for hours on end looking up them and this is when it started. If my girlfriend is cooking dinner, I’ll have the thought “what if she poisons my dinner” “what if my family don’t like me and want to hurt me” “does my family and girlfriend love me” “what if they were out to hurt me” I think you get the picture. Now I would come up with scenarios about this like I’d say to myself “okay shut up Brandon, I know for a fact she wouldn’t do that, why you thinking stuff like this”. Now someone once said to me I’m so obsessed and scared of developing schizophrenia that I always need to do compulsions to relieve a little bit of the worry/anxiety that I get. Now, I will come onto reddit and look it up and see that I’m not the only one with this but my question is WHY, WHY the heck can I have this for maybe 2 months and then it disappears for a month or so or it may come back and I start to worry again for maybe a few days then it goes away but sometimes it’s there for weeks and don’t get me wrong some days easier than others but I’m such an outgoing and friendly person but no matter what I’ll always make a bad scenario out of a good situation like I’ll always question things like I’ll see something on the tv of a man hugging his little girl and I’ll think “what if deep down he want to hurt that little girl” and I realise to myself he’d never hurt the girl cause it’s his daughter and he loves her but I’ll always see a horrible scenario and question it all the time. Can anyone else share their own experiences of this and does this sound like OCD? As sometimes I honestly panic that I am seriously ill and it puts me into major panic and I do realise that my thoughts are irrational and stupid but sometime they are so strong it scares me. Other than all that I’m such a funny and happy person you’d never know I have these thoughts but I’d just like someone to maybe tell me their stories and if it gets better or just an insight into some of your thoughts? 

Does this sound like OCD/Anxiety symptoms?

Thanks for reading guys.

113,"Hello there is this weird thing that I've been doing for a long time but it is strating to become more and more frequent. I just randomly keep saying ""Do you wanna die?"" Outloud and out of nowhere. 

I can just be doing whatever. And I just say that, and then start to think a lot about it, a lot. But it feels like there goes a shiver trough my body. And then I just say that. Without having the intention to do so.  And it is starting to freak me out, cause first it just happend somethimes. And right now it is starting to happen like almost every hour or so? My whole body starts to react to it 2. Like I just feel cold and I can feel my heart beating in my throat.

I'm 18 years old and I've struggled and have been diagnosed with depression, generalised anxiety disorder when I was 11, I also struggled with suicidality a year or 2 before that, cause it was the reason my parents took me to a therapist back then.  Ptsd and borderline personality disorder are 2  things I got diagnosed with just last year. So maybe this could give some insight. Normally I would talk to my psychiatrists about this. But they have been closed for a few weeks because of the pandemic. And they will be closed for idk how long and I have no way of contacting them, cause they're just closed..

116,"Hi, i am here to share a little about me and my mental health condition, i guess..

Let me start from the very first beginning, right when i am in my mom's womb (rn i'm 15). When my mom is having me in her belly, I already have two siblings, my oldest brother and my older sister. They're 7 (brother) and 2 (sister) at the time. My father and mother's family is already ridicule my mother to have me when my sister is only 2. My mother had been through a lot because of me, even before i was born. Nice, right.

When i came out to the world and start growing up, everyone looks so happy for me, at least that's what i thought.. I was such an energetic and happy little fella back then when i'm around 3yo, but because of that, my family slowly annoyed by me, and sometimes they told me to shut up. My siblings is getting sick of me too, especially my sister. She often gave me the side-eye and letting me down lol.

But there's one time, when I didn't stop crying because of something i can't remember, my father got mad and locked me in the bathroom with the lights off. I'm screaming and crying non-stop, banging on the door. I'm really scared i will be locked forever there. It was such an unpleasant experience that i can't get off of my head until now. Because of that, I got scared of darkness and it never get better. I sleep with the lights on, at midday i turn the lights on, and stick to the bright place. I'm not thinking there's creatures or anything, I'm just scared that i'll be locked like i was before.

So speed up to this time, some months ago i asked my mother and sister about this thing, and boy they don't even know about this. They just say that I only make this up, and even if it's true, that's definitely not true? they said im being too much, and.. yeah, never gonna share any fckn thing with them anymore.

Back to the time, as I'm growing up, I slowly lose my cheerful, energetic, and happy self. I'm being told I'm annoying and embarrassing. I'm starting to think everything that I do is wrong, so I never make my own desicion. I start to shut my mouth and close my door completely. I never give my opinion about anything, and stay silent, because.. that's what they want, right? But some people starting to tell me that I'm being such a weight and not precise. I don't have as many friends as i was, i lost confidence, and never asks for any favor from anyone.

My parents never lectured me anymore, because what i only do is shut up and do what they said. People thinking that they're really kind to me and i have such a perfect life. Everytime anyone says that, i just wanna burst into tears. I am afraid of myself. I am afraid i will fucked things up, I'm afraid what I do will be embarrassing and not enough. I'm not being pushed by anyone, I push myself.

Everybody still thinking that I am truly fine. Nothing's going on. But, no.. When I reach the age of 11, i start doubting myself. I got pulled into the world of depression. I'm starting to get stressed out because of myself. And everytime i do a wrong thing, I start to hurt myself. I began with a very light thing, I scratch my body until my skin burns. And I will get the sensation of relax, because I think that I already got 'punished' of what i did.

It only got worse. From scratch burns to permanent wounds. It's been three years since my first self harm, now it's a daily thing. I can't tell anybody about this. I've tried to give hints to my mother but she only said that i'm just making it on my head, that i'm not depressed, that i just make myself feel depressed. Ever since then i only keep everything to myself. I can't tell my siblings, because i'm pretty sure they've been through a lot too, i guess. My friends? No. I've tried. they don't care. I've stopped seeking for attention. It's useless.

These last few days, i've been thinking to end this all. I'm a mistake from the very beginning, so why would I continue if it only got worse? I have everything planned, and yeah.. maybe some weeks or months later, if God decide not to take my life yet, i'll do it myself. Nobody will notice that i'm gone, my family can sell or have my things, that means i can be useful too.. they don't have to pay for my education and my needs anymore, and they will live their best life as a perfect family without me

123,"Doesn't matter whether it's grades in college, or video games.. when I come in second place I get extremely angry and have very violent thoughts.

I honestly wished, at the time I got my grade, that he would get hit by a truck. It's stupid and immature, I recognize that, but I can't help it. Even in video games, when I come in second and I'm not the top it makes me frustrated. Sometimes it isn't even within my control to be on top, it's just the nature of the game that I come in second but it still makes me so mad.

I can't figure out why I let it bother me so much. Like so what if someone is better than me, I should be happy for them but I just can't be. Like I want them to just drop so I can be on top. Part of me hates myself for thinking like this, but another part of me loves it because it drives me to keep trying to be on top.",27Mar2020,1
124,"**Introduction**

Emotional abuse, or psychological abuse, is a form of abuse that is characterised by someone subjecting another person to behaviour that can result in psychological trauma, including anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder.

There are several different types or categories in the spectrum of emotional abuse. These include: intimidation and threats, excessive criticism, undermining, emotional blackmail, and economic abuse.

&amp;#x200B;

**Effects**

There are various effects of emotional abuse, depending on the duration, severity and vulnerability of the victim.

* Fear
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Long-term emotional abuse can have long term debilitating effects on a persons sense of self and integrity.
* Research shows that emotional abuse can sometimes be a precursor to other forms of abuse such as physical abuse.
* Higher than average rates of alexithymia, which is difficulty identifying and processing their own emotions.
* Marital and relationship dissatisfaction.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip 1: Self-compassion**

Self-compassion is when we extend compassion to ourselves regarding feelings of inadequacy, failure, or suffering. Kirstin Neff, associate professor in the University of Texas at Austin's department of educational psychology, believes self-compassion has three main components: self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness.

* **Self-kindness**: Self-compassion entails being warm towards oneself when encountering pain and personal shortcomings, rather than ignoring them or hurting oneself with self-criticism.
* **Common** **humanity**: Self-compassion also involves recognizing that suffering and personal failure is part of the shared human experience.
* **Mindfulness**: Self-compassion requires taking a balanced approach to one's negative emotions so that feelings are neither suppressed nor exaggerated. Negative thoughts and emotions are observed with openness, so that they are held in mindful awareness. Mindfulness is a non-judgmental, receptive mind state in which individuals observe their thoughts and feelings as they are, without trying to suppress or deny them. Conversely, mindfulness requires that one not be ""over-identified"" with mental or emotional phenomena, so that one suffers aversive reactions. This latter type of response involves narrowly focusing and ruminating on one's negative emotions.

If you are being hard on yourself, or you believe that you don’t deserve compassion and forgiveness, then a good tip is to imagine you are caring for a close friend, family member, or other loved one.

When he was same age as me (i’m 18 years old) - he was basketball player, he played on basketball team.
And there’s me - i can’t even play on basketball team, well i tried to become a basketball player but gave up after 2 months, but my teammates they were bullying me - because i was not good and i insulted one douchebag (i hated him so much) and i was new there, even my coach said i’m weak.
But my father had lots of friends and he was playing basketball really well, why i can’t live like he used to live?? 
I have no friends, no girlfriend, no companionship, and of course i’m short my height is 5’11” (well you can say it’s average height but for me that’s short) i feel so angry and weak when i’m around tall people. My father is 6’3” well he stopped growing when he was 18, i stoped growing 2 years ago i want to be that tall too, girls in my country doesn’t like guys who are shorter than 6’0”

To summarize, the past few years have been anything but easy. 2019/20 has especially knocked be down in the dumps. Despite such, my long distance boyfriend (US/Sweden) and I reconnected back in October, and have been doing a lot better. Before he came back along, I honestly didn't even have a reason to get out of bed. He's helped me a lot through this time.

I feel guilty that he has to help me, though. I'm always afraid that he'll eventually grow tired of my antics and leave, which would break my heart. I know he loves me; however, I can't help but have doubts sometimes due to my depression and anxiety. They make me feel like an unlovable lost cause.

I have studied so many exams while I was crying, or cried before writing the papers I had to write for that night.

Now I'm in that same situation. I have to read a book (which stresses me a lot, I can't focus) and then write a paper for tonight. In 15 minutes I have a meeting through Skype to write a script with my classmates, which will leave me with less time to write the paper. I just wanna cry and hit my head with the desk.

128,"I've never posted on reddit before, I've commented, but never posted. I'm low. It's my own fault and I can't seem to just pick myself up. 

Throughout the last 5 or 6 years I've been in and out of long lasting relationships. They always seem to find an end because of my mental state. I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and haven't found a way to cope with it. I'm now 25 and feel like I haven't made any steps since I was 16.

My relationship I'm in currently has been beyond perfect until the last 2 months. We've been together a little over a year and everything was fine. Her and I, we seem to be able to communicate and we've been very open with insecurities, anxieties, etc. We were always smiling and always happy. Always there for eachother.

Lately that hasn't been the case. I've been controlling, rude, and explosive. She's losing her patience and I can't seem to control it. I go to therapy, I go to a psychiatrist, I put in the work in the past and feel like I've fallen right back to where I am. 

The thing about this relationship that's different is shes been unbelievably patient with me and now it's like it's gone. I've pushed too much about how I feel and overstepped the boundaries. I'm unbelievably low. I just can't feel like I'm normal. I wish I could control this. I hope someone has advice, and i know you don't have answers for me, i just really need to let out how i feel, as I'm just feeling like a failure.

But for the past few years all my emotions have been felt through glass..unless they're painful. Then they can be in technicolor. I so desperately want to feel better, I want to be able to truly feel better inside if my new gf or anyone who cares about me tries to comfort me if I'm upset. That's something that's been so difficult too. Very rarely is anyone ever able to truly comfort me, friends, family, therapists. It's like the Pirates in Pirates of the Caribbean eating and it just going straight through them. 

I don't want to lose my gf, but part of me feels like if I did, I'd just sigh and cry and not feel very different, because I can barely feel any pleasure anyway. I feel temporary contentment and calm but that's it. I want to just feel normal, and I don't want my depression chasing her away. 

Please do not suggest therapy, I cannot afford it.",27Mar2020,1

I've fucking tortured my body to the point where it probably wont recover. So even when I work on the mental stuff, my life wont be great nonetheless.

136,"Over recent months I've progressively lost the ability to trust myself or take myself seriously.

There are two threads to this. The first is that I started a PhD in the autumn, which I have been struggling with. I actually took a year out after my masters because I didn't get any PhD offers first time I applied but wasn't interested in giving up. I went in confident and excited but wasn't performing as well as I had hoped. Part of this was I think due to self-sabotage, in the form of kicking problems down the road so I wouldn't have to deal with them until Later. My lack of progress became really apparent to me after Christmas, and dropping out was something that, vaguely at least, occurred to me for a few weeks. I'm now at that stage again. About a month ago my self-sabotaging dawned on me. I found the way that it manifests, procrastination and delaying, particularly disappointing; part of why I cannot take myself seriously anymore is that I find this fundamentally immature. I am constantly deferring tasks and decisions and I get relief from being able to do this, though it of course always catches up with me. I have never had very much responsibility for anything other than myself, and now I am concerned that I am seriously lacking in the resources, enterprise and resilience that an adult should have. The idea of dropping out is there, but I feel not only like I do not trust myself to make a decision, but also that if I did choose to drop out it would just be another decision to provide short-term relief without concern for the long-term.

The second thread is the following. For about three and a half years I have been considering conversion to Christianity. About a year after the thought first occurred to me, I made friends with a Christian girl (I actually know very few religious people). About a year later I caught feelings, which lasted the best part of another year. Now, since becoming friends with her I have thought much more seriously about conversion. As far as conscious motivations go, this has been about a variety of things completely independent of her. But I was aware of the possibility that subconsciously it was about her. This presented itself only as a vague possibility, which didn't worry me too much for quite a while, but since I have come to trust myself progressively less, and take myself progressively less seriously, the possibility that I am considering becoming religious essentially because of a girl has become progressively more worrying. Ultimately I have no way to decide whether this is what has happened or not. However much I can motivate the path I've taken so far in terms of reasons that have nothing to do with her (and I can, quite a lot), I can always pose the question of whether this is just another layer of deceit. This of course feeds into the difficulty to take myself seriously, or trust myself when it comes to other matters. There are a few other threads which follow a similar pattern, but these are the major ones.

In short, I feel like I have reached a level of self-doubt that makes it very difficult to assess my own life with any confidence that I am not engaged in some kind of self-deception, and I don't take myself seriously either. I don't know what the way out is. Thanks for reading if you did.

NB I have put myself on the counselling waiting list with my university but not yet been given an appointment, though they are continuing to run the service online during quarantine.",27Mar2020,1
137,"I'm not too sure where to find help while under a shelter-in-place order, so this is the only place I could think of without confronting family or friends about it.

     The past year and a half, I have been single. On March 31st, it'll be the two years in total that I have been living on my own two hours away from my home town. I moved for work related reasons and to try and find a better opportunity in a much larger city. During that time, I've found out a lot about myself and have been slowly adjusting to what it means to live on my own. I've discovered I enjoy reading, painting, and other things that try to fuel my imagination, whether it's for fun or as a means of escapism.
     With all of that being said, I still get extremely lonely. About two months into living on my own, my grandpa died June 3rd, 2018. Shortly two months after that, my girlfriend of two years dumped me during my lowest point with the fact that my grandpa was the one who practically raised me, even though I have a step-dad (biological father left when I was young, but we'll get back to that). This sort of led me into a habit of getting drunk as possible when I had the opportunity to drink with friends from my home town just coping with the fact that I live on my own. This continued from about December 2018 to maybe January 2020. I also experimented with psychedelics from the smallest doses of acid all the way to taking around 35mg of DMT to try and find more of a meaning to my life that is most likely stemming from an overwhelming feeling of nihilism. Since then I have stayed away from liquor and now do neither.

     My main source of comfort has been my mom since I have moved off and have been single. Even with every-day contact and making a friend at work, I still feel incredibly alone sometimes.  I've tried going to social events, dating, playing DnD, and finding groups in my area using the Meetup app. Every time I go do one of these things, my scalp will start to itch, I start sweating, then I have to either leave early or stop participating all together from the social anxiety it brings me. Most of the people I have met are usually super friendly. But the thing that bugs me most is that I struggle to find a partner due to a fear of rejection. Since my last relationship, it seems I end up getting too clingy. I try to talk with whomever I'm interested in on a consistent basis. Not texting multiple times asking if they are there or anything, but more just sending an image or asking what they're up to trying to stay engaged in conversation while getting to know each other. This has failed multiple times. Dating apps have not ended well for me in the slightest no matter how many times I try. I've grown/cut my hair and beard numerous times, taken up new hobbies, and try to have as much confidence as possible, but I always get nervous when I go on a date and it probably shows.
     After one person I actually re-connected with, I found out I was just merely a hookup and ended up having a breakdown. I ended up beating myself in the head until knots started forming. Nobody around. Just me in my house. This is not the first time something like this has happened. When my ex-girlfriend dumped me, the moment she drove off, I was in my car and decided to make the foolish decision of punching the roof of my car on the inside until my knuckles bled. Not out of anger toward them, but from the sheer hatred I have for myself. 

     On the 22nd, I was staying at my parent's for the weekend. I was getting  back into that same thought process where I think I'm fat (6ft, 200lbs) , ugly, and all around a failure at maintaining healthy stable relationships. My mom noticed this was bothering me while we were all watching a movie and paused it asking what's wrong. 
     This usually isn't normal. Only her and I would talk in private away from my step-dad due to his very critical nature. Most of the time, it ends up with him being extremely passive aggressive toward my mom and taking it out on her. I was faced with the decision to talk to her in private. The moment we started talking about it, he ended up slamming the bedroom door and them getting into an argument. I finally had enough and told him reasons like that are why I don't respect him and NEVER talk to him about my issues until he gets past the fact that my mom will always come first when I have problems. That was a bad decision on my part because it escalated into an argument where me and him were fighting to keep the door to another room open/closed with me yelling at him to stay away. Once my mom stepped in, a feeling of pure fear and self-hatred came over me and I proceeded to pull two small clumps of hair out of my head without thought. It wasn't an amount to where you can see bald spots on my head, but it was enough to be a cause of concern.
     I fell to the floor once the hair came loose crying harder than I ever have. After it was all over, both of my parents proceeded to hug me and we talked it all out. I couldn't tilt my head to the left or bend my neck backwards for at least two days and it still feels sore. I'm not sure if it was from the stress or when I pulled my hair.

We now have plans for me to see a counselor over all of my behavior and what has caused it to try and find out what is going on with this pattern of violent self-harm. But with the way things are going, I don't know when I'll be able to see them due to the quarantine. There's one person that I'm interested in that sort of knows what's going on because I wanted to be transparent with them, but I figured it might be best to give all of the details when I see them in person since we've been talking for a bit now. I try to think of things to say to her, but when I do, that night has haunted me since and I get depressed, ashamed, sad, and I am hating myself all over again. I feel like a monster for the way I acted and I get thoughts of suicide that I have not had in a very long time (unless un. I wish it could stop. A few friends have been my support system, but if talking to a complete stranger is what I'm going to do, then I figured this might be the next best place to just get some advice. I just really want to know if there's something I'm doing wrong socially or if that's just normal. I want my old life back where I didn't have this amount of emotional pain again.",27Mar2020,1
138,"I am a 29yo female. I have autism so I struggle a lot with social interaction and sensory processing etcetera. However, I was good at academics and persevered to get my degree. I thought that if I would achieve that, I would have proven not to be dumb. When I did get my degree, I had nothing to live for anymore. I have been severely depressed for 5 years. Now I am not severely suicidal anymore. But I struggle with the past.

My experiences from the past include bullying, being excluded, and being angry for not being understood. I was never taught to say 'no'. I now know what I felt in my childhood was anxiety, pretty much all the time. Also, there was a female classmate, we were around 11 or 12 yo and she made me undress myself when I was at her house and play sexual activities. There was no actual intercourse and she was young too. I couldn't say no. I did try to distract her from the idea but it didn't work.
There were a lot of situations of being laughed at, yelled at, being called names. 

I am in therapy now, and I struggle with insecurities, low self esteem and nightmares about the past, besides the anxiety and depression. 

My therapist say I have to change my thoughts, but they don't tell how. About my past they say it is not useful to think about it and I shouldn't do that (as if I actually do want that)

143,"Hey everyone.

I've got a lot going on. First off, I'm in a relationship that has been going strong for about 3 years, and we've had our ups and downs, but we've made it through and it's brought us closer. Before the COVID-19 stay-inside shit, he and I would see each other on a weekly basis. He and I are both adults. My family and I went out-of-state for a much-needed vacation, and we didn't know how bad the cases would get until we actually got down there. We decided to stay there as we didn't want to spend money on rearranging hotel reservations on the way back. Both of my parents' jobs told them to quarantine for 14 days. Well, my boyfriend was hoping that he and I could get together tomorrow, and quite frankly I was hoping so as well because my family is starting to drive me crazy. It's important to note that I'm currently living at home while going to college to save money on housing. When I told my mom that I was hoping to go to his house tomorrow, she said it wouldn't be a good idea as we are currently quarantining. I told him this, and he got all pissed. He said that I'm an adult and that I should be able to go where I want to go. I agree with him and told him that right now would not be a good idea due to COVID. He said that if I had COVID that I would be showing symptoms right now. That's not necessarily true as I could be a carrier and still pass it on without showing symptoms. There have been other instances in the past where he's gone off about Mom, and I told him that I don't like it when he does that as it doesn't help the situation. He asked if I don't care that she affects us seeing each other. I told him I do, but under these circumstances, that I'm going to listen to her. He wants to get me out there so I have the freedom to make my own choices, which I kind of already do. But he is getting annoyed at the fact that I'm still living there and dealing with this shit.

The reason why I haven't left is that my parents are still covering for me in regard to insurance and car payments and other bills. The only thing I'm responsible for is gas for my car. I don't have anything in my name, and I don't get enough money from my part-time job to cover anything else. 

Long story short, I'm starting to get really hurt by what he is doing and I finally had enough and told him that I need some alone time. I'm not taking a break from him nor am I leaving this relationship. I'm very happy with him, but sometimes his actions hurt. I will not leave him unless something major happens.

146,"I recently told my mum I was depressed during the last semester of university. She sort of naively keeps denying that I could've been going through that and thinks that I'm actually anxious instead and need to do more to connect to others on my course which I do realise I need to do to and plan on doing. I also got help for anxiety towards the end of last year and was prescribed propranolol which helped a lot and sorted much of that out. However, I was definitely depressed as I felt quite suicidal at points this past semester, although, I'm not sure I could ever tell her that from the guilt. I believe one of the biggest factors in the development of my depression was my smoking (weed) habits in the evenings which really affected my memory and ability to learn and in turn caused me to fall behind on my courses. I've spoken to her quite openly about me smoking before and she's fairly okay with it but wouldn't entirely condone it either. I've also cut out smoking in the past few weeks and don't plan on smoking anywhere near as frequently again in the foreseeable future. However, when she came into my room earlier to discuss my depression further I was overcome with anxiety and could barely speak to her. She continued to try and coax more information out of me and eventually I had to ask her if we could just discuss it some other time as I was becoming more and more anxious with each question. I could've just told her about the smoking as it is what I believe to be the prime reason (which I've since rectified), but I could barely speak.

It has gotten so bad that I have these horrible freak outs where I nearly pass out unless I calm myself down.

Is there some sort of online resource I can use to chat with a doctor and get a prescription of sorts?

Would I feel like a zombie on medication? 
Would I be able to function day to day on medication? 

What are the risks of taking any sort of anxiety medication or antidepressant?

i want to write here since I've been feeling really alone in my situation. my father hung himself when i was 3 (i am now 16) and even if it has been 13 years it still haunts me every day of my life. especially the past few weeks I've been having a depressive episode and when i see or read something about fathers or suicide i start sobbing and i dont know how to deal with it. if anyone has been in a simialr situation how did you overcome it? tips on how to cope? i feel stupid for still grieving everyday after so long but i am in pain anyway. he brought me to life just to take his own a bit later and it feels like ive been abandoned and tossed a heavy burden i dont think i can continue holding all my life if it doesnt get any lighter. i know i will have to accept it and move on with my life, but the feelings of bitterness and guilt have really latched onto me. it feels like a stain in my life that ill never be able to wash off :-(",27Mar2020,2

Just one of the big things idk if I can Handel is the boredom. When I get bored this like whole like energy builds up across my body making it impossible to stand still. If I try it physically hurts and  makes my hands and arms to contort. And at times expression of face.

And then the thoughts just flood in. Most of them are bad unless it's braindead enough to just daydream and autopilot the work.

 Just scattering thoughts of things I'm nervous about and fear. Ones telling me how much of failiure I am. And for work how worthless it is to slave a way for an evil coproation. Visualizations that range from unpleasant to horryifying. On the brighter side they can just be bizarre instead if I'm in a good enough mood.

Also seperate from the scattering thoughts I'll just concously think about how I'll never get at art cause im wasting my time with x tedious thing. And have a bunch of existential thoughts of time withering away. also just thinking about how overwhelmed I am when an individual task looks big.

I know this sounds childish but like idk what to do about it. Like I should be able to Handel it as all I have is general anxiety and possibly ocd but like it's so hard I have a hard time making phone calls that aren't super short before I get antsy and feel weird.

I've tried meditation but the grounding one my therapist says is good hurts the same way. I can do visualization ones and ones that make you fall away so you don't feel time or much anything but glowing lights for that matter decently.

It's also not the same as when I have trouble focusing.",27Mar2020,1

162," 

Hello everyone! I need to vent and if any of you have tips to help me, I'd highly appreciate it. This is about helping and/or coping with a parent that has mental illness and refuses to seek help. 

I’m trying to make this as quick and comprehensive while maintaining a degree of privacy.

My mother, in her late 50s, has been starving for attention most of her life. I’ve been told from her siblings, she had ‘episodes’ in her youth. Growing up, we never got along so I moved away from my family/mother at the age of 18 (in my 30s now). You know what they say: ""cut toxic people out of your life' and honestly it has worked out great for me. Unfortunately, the rest of my family cannot say the same… Now that I live away and am happy, my family is asking to help them because of my level of ‘separation’ from the family. 

The issue is: She makes up stories (and possibly fakes being ill) to get attention and accuse other people of lying or seem to be paranoid about my father/brother. Such as coming up with reasons why she can't work, or why she is better staying at home and looking after my father who works 40-70hrs a week to support her. She tracks every work hours he has to ensure he is not going to visit friends/family. He is a reserved man, and will stop on his way home to see his son. She even takes his money, and give him only $5/week so he can purchase himself a fast food coffee while at work.

I always thought that was the way my mother was… until last Fall. Her brother committed suicide. Everyone was grieving. Two days later, she faked her own suicide attempt. (and I say faked it because she lied about the amount of medicine she took and faked being ill from it to get us to give her attention). She was hospitalized right away as ambulances were called and doctors found nothing wrong with her. They did put her on suicide watch for 4 days, then into a transition house for 3 days where she begged to leave and go back home… Apparently we were not fair to her as we were asking her to give up her belonging/house/husband for the week she had to be there. Because the transition house was only a voluntary one, she checked herself out with the help of a ‘friend’ whom had confided in me that they didn’t feel good about helping her but there was no reasoning my mother. She played the 'being sweet' card and it worked on them. Beside faking illnesses, lying and attempting to get attention, she will say comments about people and then will deny it! 

All of her remaining siblings and family have disowned her now after the incident. Her husband, my father, left for a few days but she begged him to come back and live with her, which he did and he regrets as she has blocked him from messaging his own son to seek help/talk as she thinks his son will try to help him move and divorce her. Mind you my father has always supported her his entire life and been the bread winner, tho he does not know are the bills are being handled, he just hands her the money. (She can’t live without him because he makes money, and it would be difficult for me to live alone as he does not know what accounts he has, and how bills are paid etc…) 

I flew back to my home when the incident happened. She was shocked to see me at her transition house, but she also seemed to be happy to see me. It seemed that I was the only person that she trusted after the incident. I was really clear with her that what she did and what she has done to others was a terrible act. I even started calling her by her first name… She reassured me she was going to get well and her therapist from the transition house will be in touch with her to make an appointment with a psychiatrist. It has been over 6month and my mother still tells me she is still on a waiting list to see a psychiatrist. While I want to believe her, I strongly think she is making it up and refuses to see a doctor. 

Before I left, I ensured she had a ‘wellness’ binder where I had a place where she could write down her thoughts and issues, a place for her future doctors appointments, ways to become her better self but she has not used it. I offered to sign her up to a local gym or take a simple class to keep her active as she prefers sitting on front of the TV and gossiping against the neighbors. 

I live in a different country than she does so in-person help is difficult. I always kept my communication with her to a minimum. We never really got along because of her dramatic ways and now, I don’t believe the woman she has become is my mother anymore. I am angry at the way she is handling things, I am helpless when family members come to me with another story of how she is trying to create stories to gang everyone up on each other. While the ordeal has made me closer to my brother, I feel sorry for my father who is being manipulated into sticking around and paying for her. (She made threats in the past of wiping the bank account clean and getting every penny out of him if he ever left her- so you can see why he rather stay at home and live miserably than try to get out and figure out the logistics of living alone after 38years with her). 

I intend to visit again in the Fall but this time, I would like a plan of action that I could help her seek help and if anything else fails, help my father get out of this situation. 

In my last visit, it seemed she was open to the idea of me being her emergency contact and have the doctors information where I could ask private details but my visit was so short, I never was able to secure this in writing. She did agree, with me, to never speak ill of people (but that didn’t last a whole week!) and she acted like she was truly going to try and be better but 6 months has passed and she was already back being her old self within weeks of me leaving.

Sorry for the vent! I don’t know what to do; I want to help her because in return it would help everyone in my family and myself. Despite never being close to my own mother, I feel like a ‘normal’ person would help a person in distress… or am I giving myself too much pressure to help an helpless cause?",27Mar2020,1

164,"since the last couple of days I started “relearning” mathematics. I say “relearning” because I was always bad at maths and got the worst possible grades in it. I hated it so much and got panic attacks during lessons and learning. At the same time I WANTED to understand it I was immensely jealous of people who were good at it it almost made me angry to see them succeed and get praise. I often watch videos about sciency things like space or about biology or anything that seems worth knowing (which is everything). At the same time I understand very little about what seems so fascinating about these things to me because I feel like I’m not very smart. So for some crazy reason I cannot explain I ended up sitting in front of my desk day and night for the last few days and still, forcing myself to get better, to be smarter, to know more, but it also stresses me so much because it doesnt make any sense for me to suddenly be interested in maths. Imagine someone who cant read telling you they’re trying to read the biggest book they know. For some reason I feel kind of ashamed and scared and like I shouldn’t educate myself in maths. It sounds strange I know and I can’t really explain why either. Just imagine a person you know that’s really bad at maths wanting to do nothing else but to get better and showing a huge interest in it. I really want to do nothing else right now but to understand this thing I never understood. I told some people and they think I’m crazy for voluntarily learning maths all day maybe because I was always so bad at it. Sometimes I even feel if I manage to get really good at maths I can learn anything. Like I could become really smart and people will praise me for it and tell me how smart I am. I know myself that this sounds selfish and grandiose or something. Maybe I want people to think I am smart. Because I‘ve always felt stupid and like all the numbers were laughing into my face. I just really want to be the opposite of what I am. But I also want to stop learning maths because it feels unnatural and leaves me feeling depressed at night not knowing who I am anymore or what my passions are. It sounds ridiculous but I truly don‘t know why I am doing maths its like someone else is controlling me.",27Mar2020,1

166,"I’m a 23 m with bpd. Just started meds. Been going to therapy. I’m very self aware of it and the symptoms it brings with it. I entered into a relationship with someone who has bi polar (not sure the type) they too are on meds and therapy and overall seemed stable. 

As one would imagine the relationship was one of constant turmoil. Some of the issues were definitely my fault and arguably bpd related. The ones that weren’t tho scared me. How quick they would be to become angry towards me. The lack of patience. It all eventually ended because they hit a hard depression (I’m assuming possibly bipolar related) and shut me out and treated me rudely during. Everything always feeling like it’s my fault and I’m always the one saying sorry. 

Deep down I thought a relationship between two people like this would work because we both understand hardships with mental health but all it did was tear us apart.

Constant thoughts about my sexuality. I sometimes can't stop thinking about if I'm gay, or bi, or what happens if i turn out to be or how will everyone else see it or how it will affect  everything even tough i know that I'm not

Constant need to snap my fingers or tap my leg when i feel stressed or anxious. I don't know why i do it, it just relives stress and makes me feel better a bit.

Constant needs to check my pockets when going outside to see if I have everything. I always think that I'm missing my wallet or keys or phone and i check every minute even tough i just checked 5 minutes ago.

Constant fear that wile I'm sleeping, a ghost or monster will kill or harm me. It wouldn't be a problem if i were 5 but I'm 19 and i cannot sleep at night thinking that some demon is watching me or will harm me. For some reason i get chills only writing on this subject.

Constant thoughts that my friends and family hate me or don't love me because of something I did 10000 years ago. I don't know why i always think that the people i love despise me for something that i did or that they might hate me if I'm not perfect.

Constant need to do everything perfect to the point where if i make a slight mistake I loose my shit. I was just playing with a drawing book when i drew outside the line and just lost my mind. I didn't even wanted to do it anymore, it was ruined in my mind.

Constant need to re-write emails 10000 times until they feel 100% right. Even this post went trough the same treatment... If i write anything I will re-write until I feel like there is not a single flaw, spell checking and stuff like that.

All of my opinions on things are just neutral. It's like I dont love or like anything. This can spread from music, to shows, to even my family and friends.

181," 

I don't know if anyone here can help me with this. My situation is this:

&amp;#x200B;

I am in the UK.

&amp;#x200B;

I have Autism, but I am on the very able end, my main issue is anxiety. 

I live in a flat that is part of a converted house, I absolutely HATE the place to the point I am getting very close to smashing it to bits. I do not consider it to be my home at all. The main issue is my pathological liar, mentally abusive, controlling ex partner 'lives' in the flat above, even though he left in January and abandoned it. I am now trapped here, being told in no uncertain terms to STAY in here. I am trapped in here with all these memories of him doing really awful things to me emotionally, plus all the other associated risks. I can't even throw my bed out, I can't stand that as he has been in it. I can't stand this place AT ALL. I am upsetting my mum with it, as I start my day by kicking and throwing stuff. I can't control that anymore. 

The lettings agency simply do not care, as for some bizarre reason he is still paying the rent. He was almost evicted in January but they even backtracked on that having fallen for his lies. They have not carried out any gas safety or electric safety checks since he vanished, so I have NO idea what condition the gas system is in or anything. 

The electricity went off a few days ago up there, as he left a light on all the time. So now the fridge freezer will be festering. 

I have black mold in the meter cupboard, which is situated in my bedroom, feet from where me and my dog sleep. The place is cold, damp, nasty. Over the past week, a smell that is like urine has been coming into the under stairs cupboard in this flat as well. When the agent went in for the water meter, she noticed bowls of cat food and a litter tray had been left as well! 

I keep hearing little 'pitter pattering' sounds which I strongly suspect may be rodents, but the agent said she didn't see any signs of that, sigh. I know the loft is full of nesting birds because you can see them flying in and out. 

Before the outbreak, I was trying desperately to move out, but of course that is on hold now. 

I am VERY worried that he may come back. He has NO respect for rules or police, is VERY anti authority and no doubt will be having a lot of fun flouting the current UK lockdown. He is a heavy smoker who is ALWAYS coughing. I am really worried about running into him one day outside, where he will not respect social distancing.  He proved his ability to do this by coming back just before the water company came about my meter and had to be let into his flat by the estate agent, in order to pick up post which would have given away the fact he is not living there. I am worried I may be infected by him in one of these encounters apart from much else. There is NO knowing if or when this may happen, and it is causing me to be very upset and anxious. I have Autism, which I feel has been disregarded by everyone involved apart from my mum, who is 72, so I will NOT be asking her to come running if this day comes. 

I am spending every day both trying to stop myself levelling this awful place and listening for doors, floorboards creaking, cars pulling up outside, the lot. I simply do NOT know what to do if/when he does come back. I stopped being able to sleep this week, as I am on high alert all the time. I cannot let my guard down in case he does something really awful like cough through my letterbox or something like that. 

He coughs constantly because he is a heavy smoker, spits, doesn't shower for DAYS at a time till you can see the dirt and grease on his skin and hair. He simply does NOT care, then when he is confronted by authority, or even ME, he tells these huge elaborate stories which have SOME basis in truth, but it is all twisted up with HUGE, VERY convincing lies, and brands us all 'Freemasons' or 'Illuminati'. He doesn't pay his bills because he thinks the Illuminati have enough money!. Sigh. 

He will make out that it is YOU who is in the wrong. I have gone up against him SO many times now, I don't know a single person, even my own family, better than I know this man. 

I have NO backup if he comes back, only the added risk of being infected with Covid 19. 

I am hours away from completely levelling this place, so it won't be fit to live in anymore. I feel as if this is my ONLY way out now. 

The only thing keeping me going was my driving lessons, at 34, I have finally been able to start learning to drive, and I am braving it in a manual car as well, grappling with my coordination issues, and winning! I have driven a car twice now! My gosh I was thrilled. However even that has been called off now because of the virus. It's just me now, me and this disgusting place. Day in, day out.

184,"Hey guys. I hope you all are coping in times like these. I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask for guidance of this sort, I don’t use Reddit often so I apologize.
Story goes: I had my first experience a few months ago. It sounds really stupid but basically my mom showed me this Ring doorbell picture of a girl who had been prowling around our neighborhood stealing packages and it triggered something in me. Her face was so distorted but she looked so familiar (turns out she was a girl that went to my high school so that made sense). I started hyperventilating and had a mild panic attack. I was able to calm myself down until we got in the car to meet my tutor at a coffee shop and weird things started happening. An ambulance pulled onto our street and something took over me. As we were driving, I could see people were staring at me and felt they were out to get me. My mom tried to assure me that no one was looking at me but it turned into a full blown panic attack where I felt like I left my body. A feeling rushed over me and I felt like I could predict everything my mom was going to say- like she was lying to me and she was in on it. We turned around to head home and I slept it off. None of it made any sense at all.

After that I was put on Prozac for OCD/anxiety (only 20mg I think). Things were fine for a while until about a month ago when I stopped taking it simply because I forgot about it as I wasn’t really used to the routine. I woke up one morning and saw a man laying on my floor staring at me. I figured I was waking out of a dream and went on my phone for a little while to wake myself up, but when I looked over he was still there. He went away after a few seconds. Went to school that day hearing muffled voices/whispering that none of my friends could hear and they figured I was just goofing because that’s something I would joke about. It got really bad to the point where every corner I turned I saw something there. Called my dad, went home, took my medication and all was fine.

Every once in a while I’ll see everything out of the corner of my eye but nothing I wouldn’t consider normal until last night. I watched the movie “A Beautiful Mind” not knowing that it was about a man with schizophrenia and it freaked me the fuck out. When it was over I started seeing things in the kitchen following me around and in the shadows. I went to my mom who was asleep (it was like 4am- I’ve been on a weird sleep schedule with this whole corona thing) and had a panic attack in the corner of her room. Wouldn’t let her touch me and just screamed. There were faces everywhere but they weren’t really faces. I sat there for about an hour and eventually went back to my room, mostly  feeling normal, and fell asleep.

I’ve been seeing things again today. Nothing very intrusive- mainly just out of the corner of my eye. I’m seeing my psychiatrist Monday. 

I don’t think it’s schizophrenia. I’ve always been a very paranoid person but this is really getting to a point where I feel unsafe. How do I cope with this in the meantime? How can I make it go away? i feel like I’m losing it and I’m really scared.",27Mar2020,1
185,"Many ways of coping with mental health problems involve short-term strategies that help you avoid, suppress, or distract from the problems. This helps you feel better in the short-term, but causes more problems in the long-term as the problem gets bigger over time.

So let’s all share our ways of coping and exchange some idea and reflections. It’s up to you how you describe it, but it might be useful using this format: 
PROBLEM:
COPING STRATEGY:
REFLECTION:
Let me start with my example:

PROBLEM: Missing social contact

COPING STRATEGY: distracting myself from it by working longer on various projects that are important to me.

REFLECTION: working long-hours might help me get closer to my goals, but takes me further away from my needs for social contact.

186,"A bit of story behind this:When i was in first grade(6 y/o) i kept on thinking a lot about my future and what would happen when i was got to 18 years of age.My child mind emidiatley didn't know what was going to happen and got scared,now for the next 12 years of my life all that can come to mind is suicide.I know,hard to imagine a 6 year old thinking about that already but unfortunatley it is like that.

Throught my years i've never been one to stress about not having a girlfriend,that was until i was listening to a podcast about 4 years back with Joe Sugg(Youtuber) and he got asked when he lost his verginity,i belive he said 21 to which the voice of the podcast (TrueGeordie) said he lost it pretty late and from that point on i beggan stressing i can think straight and getting not rejected but ignored by girls i like seems like an ecosistem now:Get attracted,gather confidence,shoot a dm,get ignored,be sad for the next month,repeat.I've been watching those AskReddit videos on Youtube and honestly im so dissapointed how things turned out with me while seeing people lose their v card at 14 im still on never actually having a girl,i've realised that days of fooling around have passed and my childhood has ended.And yeah i might have some selfconfidence isuess but once on a blue moon it does happen,where i look in the mirror and say ""You know...today is not that bad"" and i hate when i say that because it reminds me of the day before and the day before that etc.

Through the years i kept telling myself to just suck it up and be greatfull for what i have which is my loving parents and a roof over our heads.But honestly it's not going to hold up for much longer,i already told myself that i'll probably be gone in August but i fear it might be even quicker.Im not asking for any type of help i don't need help nor want it,i belive that only i can fix myself before its too late.If i could just start everything again id decline it for sure since my life can only go down for some reason.I've tried alcohol and it does work for the time that im drunk and a couple days after that before the cycle repeats but i've stoped drinking now for about a month so i guess thats a plus.

Last thing i want to write here is that when i get these lets call them ""episodes"" of sadness i keep seeing long narrow shadows quickly jumping from one side to the other and after dissapearing and also hearing my name being called yet either no one is around or the person whos voice i heard says they didn't call me.I read something about this mental desiese and it's a form of Schyzophrenia yet i doubt i have it.I also don't want to self diagnose cause i belive thats huge dissrespect for the person whos actually suffering and has to live with that disese.",27Mar2020,1
187,"Content warning: death, illness, graphic description

I experienced an unexpected discovery of a dead body a month ago. It was my flatmate. It looked terrifying; dried blood on his bedsheets, dried blood in his lifeless eyes, and dried blood on his mouth. That day, I heard him in his room making abnormal noises. I thought: he probably drank again and he is hungover. The toilet was covered in dried vomit so he's been there during the night. He had a few situations like this after he drank so I thought he's just going through it. When I was leaving for my classes I didn't hear anything more, that ""moaning"" lasted a few seconds so yeah. If it lasted longer I probably would suspect something. So when I came back I went to the kitchen to make dinner. After I ate I saw the toilet was in the same state as before so I sent the pics of it to my landlord, because he always required photos if something was unclean or damaged. Then my landlord said he's calling his mom. Then his mom called my landlord back to say that he's not answering his phone and that I should knock on the door to see if he really is there. I thought ""maybe he's not there because if he was I probably would've heard his phone ringing"". But I still knocked to ask if everything's ok, not walking in. I didn't hear anything so I assumed he's not here. I told my landlord that he probably still has his classes (but at the same time I remembered he was really hungover that morning so it would be weird if he left). He said ok, and no one called me for next 30 minutes. Then I get another call from my landlord who tells me this guy has diabetes and that I should check on him! And I didn't know he was ill before! I said I okay and without hesitation walked into his bedroom after that because I thought he may have lost consciousness, or worse, fell into a coma. Then I  saw him lying on his bed, I called his name because he looked like he was sleeping. And then I walked up to him and yeah... He looked terrible. I walked out to call 911 and to catch a breath. I fell on the floor because it was a horrifying thing to see. I still don't know what happened to him, probably he drank alcohol which is bad for diabetics (because it contains sugar and then his sugar levels went up and fucked his body up). So yeah. 
And after that I've been having nightmares and flashbacks about this event, but a month after it's not that intense. A fear that I've been having is a fear of death; yes, I know death is not avoidable, and a normal process. Everyone dies. But that's not where I'm going. I'm scared of premature death. I'm scared I'll die alone, painfully and slowly like this guy. I'm scared I won't even be able to tell anyone goodbye, I'm scared of the process of dying. And also of finding a dead body again. Also; I started being really cautious about sugary drinks and foods. I know that is not how one gets diabetes, other factors are vital, but mostly it's inheritable. Still, I can't go through a day without thinking about this event. I can't go to bed without thinking I may die in my sleep. This shit fucks me up. I've been reading more about diabetes and death recently. I know you can live with diabetes all your life if you're cautious. This guy wasn't because he didn't eat healthy foods, drank alcohol etc. But still. The eyes and his fair skin were the creepiest. The light in his room was on but there was no light in his eyes. They were covered with mucus and had dark brown spots which are called, from what I've read, ""tache noire"". It appears a few hours after death when sclera is exposed to air. It creeped me out and I still remember this view in details. 
Yes, I know I shouldn't be reading about death and that I'm literally rubbing salt into my own wound. But I want to get prepared in case, I don't know. It's sick. Even now when I'm writing this I feel like puking. I just had to let this out. It's been messing with my mind and I don't want to tell my friends/ family that I'm reading about death lol. I don't know what I can do because I can't see my psychiatrist right now (coronavirus) and I don't even have money. I only called him so he could prescribe me some meds, I told him about this situation, he was shocked but it wasn't the same as having an appointment. I still had to pay for it so yeah. I'm stupid as hell for doing all this to myself. But it's not easy to forget. I can't stop worrying.",27Mar2020,1

197,"I either die or kill my ego. The latter has already started and is a work in progress. It's not intentional, but I think it's happening as a way to cope with my life. If the origin of hurt is emotion, then the mind will slowly try to wipe emotions away completely. That's my hypothesis. Six years ago I was an energic guy full of life and was very expressive. At this point I'm the complete opposite. For every year that passes I become less and less invested in anything, I don't care about anything regarding myself or my life, I only ever care about others at this point. In my mind I myself have almost been erased from existence, already I feel like I'm just controlling a lifeless husk from a third perspective. Which leads me to believe I've almost completely eliminated my ego, all I have left is empathy. That is the one emotion I can't seem to get rid of, and I wish I could, because I feel like it's holding me back. Life would be so easy as a psychopath.

199,"I was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2014, but I've been hearing voices and having these intense, unexplainable dreams as far back as 2012 or 2011.
  
  
The symptoms are so much worse now. Instead of little bugs or animals, I see the silhouettes of dead bodies, formed like adults but impossibly small, often in piles. I also see this tall, featureless man that seems to follow me around, even though he never takes a step. Sometimes, I hear the tall man's voice in my head as well, and the voices of these two children, who often follow me in my dreams and tell me how I'm going to die, but also how I'll get my revenge. 
  
  
Today, I had one of those intensely vivid dreams again where something terrible happens to me, I feel everything as though it's real life, and I violently woke up just before my death, struggling to breathe and experiencing phantom pains from being attacked in my dream.
  
  
Three men were torturing me and ripping off my body parts with their bare hands, and then they stuffed my armless, legless head and torso into the back seat of their car, along with a lit match. 
The whole time while I was being stuffed into this car, one of those two kids was nearby, talking as if giving some sort of breaking news story. He just kept casually saying ""the body was never recovered"", as if he couldn't say anything else.
  
  
The last time that the boy said his line, a single lit match was stuffed through the window of the car, and the old seats immediately ignited from their exposed threads. I vaguely remember feeling my skin being burned, and my intestines hardening into rocks inside of my stomach.
  
  
I heard this loud ""boom"" just as the car exploded, and I woke up immediately. 
  
  
I rarely cry anymore, but I feel like crying right now. I'm terrified. I know that it wasn't real, but every part of me that was wounded or removed in the dream is throbbing with pain right now.

I used to be filled with grand emotions whether it was through music, the way the sun reflected through the trees, driving down A1A looking at the ocean, filming things, writing, reading, everything I did held a purpose, everything around me gave me intense emotions
Let me preface this, in highschool I went out a lot, I had a few friends, I did normal teenager things until I turned 18 and my depression, anxiety, and eating disorder became unbearable, and I began to isolate, the few friends I had really hurt me so I left them and I just became a lot more closed off.

He’s helped me so much that I can’t explain it, he honestly deserves the whole fucking world and more. We had an on and off relationship but it didn’t bother me, it was just the fact that distance was hard.

This is for real now though, he doesn’t want to continue anymore dating online as it’s just way to hard. Even though this hurts for me to think about because we’ve been dating for quite some time and he’s helped me though so much. I agree with him it’s very hard. So we both decided that it was a better option to stop dating online.

Another reason for him wanting to break up was that he thought I’d stopped liking him or was speaking to others. None of this was ever true. He thought this because he noticed I’d stopped texting as frequently and this was only because I found things very difficult that were going on and I just was in a bad and dark place so it was difficult for me to communicate in the way I wanted.

Last night I spoke to him to get things cleared up. I told him that I agreed it wouldn’t be a good idea to date and that I’d never stop loving him any less even though we couldn’t be together in real life. He said the only reason it’s not working is because it’s online. I agreed.

He said his dream is to live near me or with me. This is also my dream. The thing that I’m most worried about now is that I can’t be there for him when he needs it the most. For all that I know he might not like me as much as he did back then. I just want him to understand that I want to be there for him and I will always keep him in my heart. It’s unfortunate that we can’t be with each other.

What’s making me the most worried is that his life is really starting to fall apart. He’s got so many things that he has to deal with going on in his life and I just feel incredibly bad for him. This makes me want to be there with him and support him. 

He said he feels depressed and suicidal, I’m struggling as I can’t be there. I feel helpless. I feel as if I can’t take this anymore. I struggle thinking about this all day, everyday

I've always been a high-achieving student (HS senior), but I find more and more than I've been slacking.

I feel like I can't get myself to engage in learning and this has impacted my grades. Most of the time when I try to do homework, I feel anxious about how much work I have to do and find myself thinking more about the deadlines than the actual work. This combined with other miscellaneous things (sports, work, responding to emails, etc.) make me want to shut down and do nothing. I just can't stop feeling overwhelmed, even if my workload is doable. (Anxiety?)

Other times, I simply can't find the motivation to start tasks. I don't know if that could be because of some sort of depression or if I'm already starting to feel overwhelmed by my workload. I've also noticed that I've lost interest in some of my hobbies, and that I just want to sit around and do nothing instead. Just lazy? Or symptoms of depression?

From what I understand, anxiety and depression have some overlap. Does this sound like either of these to anybody? I'm not trying to be the attention seeking, ""I have a mental illness"" person, I'm just ready to figure out whatever my problem is. Maybe I'm just not disciplining myself enough.

Back in October, I got in my first ever major car accident. It was bad and I suffered a concussion so I don't remember too much of what happened. Mind you, I'm a 24 year old female who has travelled long distances and kept a clean driving record. The other car was full of lots of people so my policy limit was been capped out with all their claims. Let's jump back into the present.

I flew to Hawaii for my sister's wedding which got immediately cancelled because of COVID-19, after my family and I had already been in Hawaii for a week to celebrate my niece's birthday party. We definitely burned through a lot of savings because we wanted to make this a memorable time since we didn't think we'd ever come back. When we returned, both my parents were put out of work by COVID-19 and are now applying for unemployment.

Even more than that when I came back, I found out that my really close friend had died unexpectedly. And the worse part is I can't go see my friends or attend her funeral because my city is under shelter in place. We can't even grieve together. She was so young, she was my age 24 and just got a job working for Google. 

I'm a really responsible person financially, I live within my means. I save like crazy. I make 45k a year which I'm blessed to have this job. But I just found out today that one of the claimants in the car accident wants to sue me for $3 million dollars. $3 million dollars. I don't have that kind of money. My parents don't have that kind of money. I don't know own anything of value. Yes the car accident was my fault but not because I was overly careless, the roads were extremely curved and the speed limit was like 60 miles per hour. I had pulled out of a stop sign to turn left and that's when I got hit. I acknowledge it's my fault and the sound of the other car crying and getting into the ambulance will forever haunt me. The idea that I caused someone that permanent distress kills me.

I know deep down I would never try and harm myself. But you know what's really sad? I checked and even my life insurance wouldn't cover the cost of that settlement amount. I've always believed that like there's a path and that everything happens for a reason but I'm so so lost about what the reason is for this pain.

I know that they're also probably way overshooting the amount and they'll settle for less, but I saw the medical bills. It's a lot. It's still more than I have and I feel so guilty that I can't fix what I did. I don't know what to do.",27Mar2020,1

Quick overview though, I'm 19 and at uni, Hannah, my girlfriend, is 18 and would have finished her a levels this year. I have been her for around 10 months. Yep not very long, but man I love her, I'd do anything for her and she means to world to me, sorry, sob stories and all.
Anyway things have been getting really hard between me and her, probably becuase of this virus outbreak

My parents have never really been there for me, I always used to get told off, and going to university was the happiest time in my life, I could be away from parents, do what I want and not get told off.

I confide in my girlfriend a lot, she's called Hannah by the way, she has helped me through very hard times with parents and basically life but recently we've drifted away.

We've just had a serious conversation about keeping this relationship going after a tiny argument, I can't even remember what exactly about. Basically our conversations have dried up and I feel pushed away from her. 

There's nothing to talk about now that there's a lockdown (I'm in UK), so I can't drive and see her to talk through our issues, plus I don't really have any friends close enough to talk to about this aswell.
I feel empty and alone, and the thought of her leaving, I just can't handle.

We don't want to break up at all, and I want to turn this around, and hopefully stay with her, especially through this challenging time, she's all I have really 

Hannah has such an amazing personality and is absolutely beautiful. I want to make us work, and I really just need some help on how to make that happen. All we ever talk about is how our day has been, which is litterally the same every day now, and that's it.
I need to try my best to not loose this amazing girl, so yeah, any help would be greatly appreciated, even if it's just a simple comment saying everything will be okay.

I over think a lot and this is probably just me bearing myself up. It just feels I'm in a box and whenever I try to teach out so get pushed further and further inside. 
In past relationships I've been controlling and selfish, becuase that's all I've ever had in my life, but with Hannah I've tried my best to not be, becuase it's just not fair on her at all.

I don't think it's fully sunk in that I might end up loosing her, looking back I can see how we've drifted away slightly and that hurts me so much.

I want to keep our relationship alive and thriving but my mind is blank. I don't know what to do or say, or feel. I've rewritten this whole post 10 times, so sorry if it's all over the place. So yeah, I'm just blabbering on now, thinking of things to say and reasons why I shouldn't post this",27Mar2020,1

213,"I dont know if this the right place to ask or even how to ask but i just need some answers. I have a bad habit of doing things wrong when I know exactly how to do it right. For example If im printing something I know im supposed to save and then hit print. Instead I might turn the computer off and not realise i did that until its too late. 
Or maybe I'll put food to defrost in the microwave and instead I'll put the frozen food in the fridge and then walk away thinking that its in the microwave. Or maybe ill push on my front door to open it and for the 17th time within these past few months I tried to push it open even though I've lived here my whole life and know that im supposed to pull it! 
This do one thing end up doing another happens A LOT. I don't know why I cant stop doing this. I'm only 26 and this has been going on for years whats wrong with me!?",27Mar2020,1
