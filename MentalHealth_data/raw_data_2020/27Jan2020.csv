0,"I wanted to be a voice actor for video games. If we're being general, that is something I could do in Canada, but for AAA titles, that would be something done exclusively in LA, in the US. 

I'm still starting out with voice acting, and I'm having a lot of fun when I do it, but immigrating to the US is always at the back of my mind. It's not only where the big stuff is done, but living there would mean to be part of what many praise as the best country in the world. 

I'm aware, however, that immigrating to the US is a tall order. It's something that may never fall into the cards for me. So I guess what I'm wondering is, how do I cope with wanting something that may never happen, and accepting where I'm at in life/where I live.",27Jan2020,1

2,"Tw: self harm/sucidal thoughts 

This question has been in the back of my mind for months, maybe years now but I couldn’t ask anyone in my real life, so I’m here asking the question.

For the past year and a half I’ve gone really down hill. I’m a 16 year old and I live in England so I’m getting close to my GCSEs and it was around the time I started my course that I felt like I am now, so it could realistically just be the stress of school that’s causing me to feel the way I do.

Pretty much all I’ve been feeling is sad, stressed, angry and worried. There a few moments of happiness but they go very quickly and they are few and far between. So many times when I’ve tried to get off my phone and try do some homework I’ve either given up after 10 minutes or produced a horrible piece. So I always end up doing them late the night before or in the mornings they are due in a panic, and before this term (started in early January) I have never missed a piece of homework, and now I’ve already missed two. My grades have taken a hit too, when I started my courses I was at 7s or 8s across the board but in my most recent tests I’ve gotten 5s and 6s across the board. Getting up for school has become almost impossible, it takes my parents to come in and yell at me with 5 minutes before I have to leave for me to even get out of bed. And the school day leaves me nothing short of exhausted, but then again I’ve started walking home recently so I’m not sure at all. But whenever I get home I think I’ve got a piece or two due for tomorrow I should do them early and get good sleep, but I always end up getting into bed and staying there until it’s time for dinner, often falling sleep.  But I haven’t talked to anyone besides my gf about this so it could just be a completely normal thing for a student to be going through and I’m just overreacting. 

Social interactions are always exhausting and terrifying for me, a friend of mine texts me ‘hi’ and I wait until I’m completely alone in case they want to call me and I can’t because I’m with other people and I don’t want to let them down again because I’ve always said I’m busy like 7 times before. And another friend wants to hang out with me but I just always want to sit at home and do nothing but I always go out because I never want to let them down, even if I have other stuff to do. The thought of slightly annoying someone I barley know at all terrifies me, and I’m always thinking someone I’m close to is angry with me, I say someone but it’s usually almost everyone. And I always think that everyone I’m not Close to detests me because I’m ugly and annoying. The thought of speaking infront of a class makes me sweat, and interviews (jobs/collages)  have the same effect.  But the thing is when I get in those situations I can manage them with ease, I’m terrified though out it but I do well, I got a top grade in a speaking assessment infront of the whole class, I’ve gotten every position that I’ve had an interview for and in a mock interview I was scored almost full marks. I’m not exactly brilliant at talking, because asking questions I’m always terrified that I’m gonna seem annoying or something, but I can always answer questions well, even if I’m panicked while answering. But again, this could just be normal teenage stuff and I just don’t know how to deal with it.

Also I’ve have something like a panic or anxiety attack or anything, I’ve never attempted suicide, even I have had many suicidal thoughts and have planned out how I would do it, and only ever cut myself twice. And my situation is so much better than others around me. I live in a good house, I get to go on nice holidays often, I don’t have any underlying health issues other than mild asthma that barley effects me, none of my relatives are ill, ffs I have a beautiful and amazing girlfriend. 

My girlfriend also has some issues, it’s likely she has depression and is going to get counselling for it soon. At the start of our relationship I used to get jealous, extremely and unreasonably jealous and it very almost ruined our relationship, I was just always terrified of her leaving me for someone better, because she is so much better than me, so I got angry every time she talked to guy, but recently I’ve gotten past that and I haven’t felt jealousy anywhere near that for 3 months. the only time I came close was recently when she shed new light on an old situation, where she was pressured into spending one and one time with another guy by that guy, and he got very angry when she suggested that she would invite me and he could invite anyone he wanted, and she ended up inviting him to hers, but it wasn’t here fault at all so I wasn’t angry at her, just the guy that she got pressured by, and I’m sometimes weary of him as to me it seems weird that he pressured her into spending one and one time with him and got angry when she said no at first.  Before now I only knew about him going round to hers just them two. Anyway, recently I’ve found new ways of ruining our relationship, because I always think she is angry at my and hates me because I made a bad joke, or just because I’m an annoying person. And she’s so lovely to be putting up with me when she’s going through her own stuff but I really hate myself for putting her though it. She’s so great and I just can’t understand why she hasn’t left me yet because she really is so much better than me, and I can never provide the support I should be able to for her, when she is struggling with school, or family issues, or people dying, I can’t never properly support her and I just want to be able to. I hate myself for it. I just feel pathetic in our relationship and my life because of all my issues and the way I can’t deal with them at all. 

My life is brilliant, yet everyday I feel sad, stressed or angry. So I hate myself for that so much and I get so angry at myself. Sometimes I get into spirals of self hate where every little thing that I do gets me more and more angry at myself and the only way to pull myself out of it is to go to sleep or wait a few hours.

I’m sorry that this post is long, rambely and probably made no sense, I’ve probably also missed some points out so if I need to fill in details, please tell me. I just started writing down my feelings into this post and this has what’s came out. Thank you for listening to me and any insight/advice about my situation is really appreciated, thank you :)",27Jan2020,1

I feel like theres something ripping me apart inside me and i just cant let it out but holding it inside is oh so painful. I dont really want to trust anyone anymore because i know i shouldnt. It doesnt help that my brother flipped out on me about something earlier and as i replied to him more angrily, he grabbed my jaw and i just told him to keep his hands off me but it made me pretty upset since im a girl.

12," After undergoing a traumatic breakup that i made up in my own mind and heavily expressed upon my significant and her family rather than taking it for what it was (a break so i can focus on my mental health and well being as well as her), I blew it completely out of proportion until I felt in my mind their may be no return and maybe even further. I can finally see what happened whilst not allowing my cognitive thinking to ever take part in my decision making. Everything i had done in the relationship and had been doing until this day had all been out of pure emotion, obsession, and depression regarding my guilt over the past rather than ever accepting the present and for what it needed to be (even though i felt happy it wasn't how i should have felt). As well as obsessing of this fantastic possible future i could have with her because of how invested i was in that obsession with the romance i had and could have with her. I am getting the help i finally needed for so many years whilst putting all this weight on such a young and impressionable lady who had only been kind and sensitive to me during the entire endeavor. So today after enveloping my being into that relationship (and hurting myself/and her more than ever was necessary because of my mental instabilities and disorder) I'm taking care of the most important mistake of my life and that was to ever start this disgusting drug addiction with poppers/maulers/whiss/whatever (tobacco and weed) 8 years ago. IT COMPLETELY SEPARATES YOU FROM COGNITIVE THINKING AND YOUR OWN REALITY, MAKING YOU SO EMOTIONAL YOU'RE BOUND TO GET DEPRESSED NO MATTER WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE. and by the video i'm sure you can tell how often i partake in this and the withdrawals i'm about to ensue :) please, if this sounds like you, seek help. I need a whole lot after creating misconstrued reality of my relationship and not being accepting to my own issues.

13,"*TW, I mention sexual assault and unwanted advances.*





Almost 2 years to the day, I was sexually assaulted by a stranger. My brain has blocked out the worst of it but I'm fairly sure I was taken full advantage of. Friday night (its sunday), my step brother came onto me. Kept brushing his hand against my thigh and staring at my butt/crotch when he thought I wasn't looking. He did other things too but my brain is too jumbled to list them all.  I'm still not recovered from it and dont know what to do. I can't sleep, thinking about it makes me feel sick. It's bringing back memories of my assault and I'm losing my mind over it. My mind is all fuzzy and I dont feel like myself anymore.

Their support brought me to my first tears in over 6 years.



And I'm already trying to shut the flood gates after opening them last weekend.  I don't want to but my mind will not leave me alone.

THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS, DONT MAKE YOURSELF ANOTHER ONE.  NONE OF YOUR PROBLEMS ARE REAL, YOU'RE JUST A WUSS.  GET OVER IT.  SHUT UP.  DONT TALK.  NO ONE ELSE NEEDS TO KNOW.  NO ONE ELSE *CAN* KNOW.  STOP BUGGING THEM.  YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU OPEN UP, YOU SCARE PEOPLE AWAY.  YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GET CLOSE.  AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THEM.  IT'S YOU.  IT'S ***ALWAYS*** YOU.  YOU DONT DESERVE FRIENDS.  YOU DONT DESERVE HAPPINESS.  ALL YOU DO IS FUCK THINGS UP, HURT PEOPLE, CAUSE PROBLEMS.  YOU'RE A FUCKING MISTAKE.

My father has also emotional and physically abused me on and off, but he is kind to me and I still love him very much. Yet none of this abuse really affected me that much during this time, yet for the last couple of months it just feels like I've come to the realization of how severe it was/is. I've been in a new relationship for about 4 months and I realize Im always apologising and thinking the worst about everything. On top of these two abusers in my life I underwent severe mental health issues in mental school with meds, and toxic friendships for the past 5 years. In middle school I was heavy bullied which caused me to distance myself from everyone my first two years of highschool, not talking to anyone besides my boyfriend, who was emotionally abusing me.

I'm not being sarcarstic, the American military is all I know right now and it's a good package for a warrior.  You don't get millions for braving the unimaginable atoricites of war but it's better than slave armies, which are out there.  We've come a long way since forcing slaves to bare steel on one another.  We may be able to actually take some pleasure in battle in coming ages of good Federal and Vigilante work.  If you believe in a cause, it's out there somewhere, get your training and licenses, the world is yours.  I loved being a soldier, didn't get to do it all, got gout.  That's hard to get a waiver for on top of previous psychiatirc experiences and maybe being the Lord.  All is well otherwise, absolute unit.

I do not know what your fate or destiny is, it's in your hands now, mostly.  I try to be poetic, I can't humor or compensate for these soft peoples squishy brains.  

Basically my comp appeal involved rape, child rape, I saw some kids get raped in Iraq, it was totally fucked up.  Child sex slaves or something, it's the extent of inhumanity I experienced there.  Battle was fickle, I was in mortar volley's on top of me, quite a few.  I'm sure my brain is fucked from that, I'm coping well.  I mean, that shit sure isn't natural.

I understand professionals EMT's, Police, have to deal with that, and I was prepared to deal with it to.  It's just fucked up, I was told to file, followed my instructions, and it was just insulting.  I don't know who these people are, fuck em.

I feel okay while I’m with other people, they’d probably never guess that I feel the way I do. There’s always a smile on my face, I’m a really positive and happy person. But I can’t shake this weird sense of sadness and loneliness, and it’s taking a toll on me. I’m in the middle of a 4-month stretch for work in Florida, which is my favorite part of the year.

24,"I always feel like I'm grasping for air, so, today, I made this account to vent - sorry if it's too long?

Since I was ten/eleven I feel myself struggling with my mental health. My family had a big financial change in 2008 and me and my mom had to move to a poor neighboorhood and I had to change from a very fancy school I used to go to since I was four to a very low-income and bad quality one. I didn't adapted very well, I used to cry and shake everyday after school and I remember feeling very stressed and I was never bullied, but once I took too long in the bathroom - because I was crying - and when I got out I was punched in the face. I don't remember much from those days, but I still remember how stressed I was all the time, it's always if something squeezes on my gut.

Outside school, I wasn't having such a great time as well. I was assault a few times by the son of one my mother's friend that used to live on the same building as we, and I vaguely told her about it and she talked to her, but that was that - after that, I started eating a lot of junk food and ended up gaining some weight, so my weight began to become a problem. I also tried to hang myself, but ended up not working. My relationship with my mother was at a really bad place as well, I feel like it was because both of us were really stressed out, but I almost don't remember her being around and when she was we were always fighting and she used to beat me up sometimes. 

After two years, my family, mostly my mother, got very worried about me, so I ended up switching schools for one I really liked, but that was it, like ""problem solved"". The view of my family on mental health I feel like is a very specific one, because my aunt had a big breakdown when she was 20 (I had just been born) and ended up hospitalized for almost a year and it was very severe - she's okay now, she is bipolar and takes very good care of her mental health, - but I feel like they dismiss anything that isn't so extreme like what she had, so maybe that's why they didn't follow up - or maybe I didn't shown enough ""signs"", I don't know?

As I went through the first half of my teenagers years I felt always at bay, but I guess I was mostly content. I was relieved I had changed schools and my relationship with my mother started to change, she recognized some of her mistakes (not the way I really wanted, and it took almost six years in total, but better than I could ever imagine, she really grew as I person, I think). I tried to commit suicide one more time, on pills, but it didn't worked, my family asked me if I had took a bunch of pills, because they saw the garbish and I just said no and it ended up on that.

When I started high school things changed (again). First, I changed schools, because I wanted, two of my best friends, ""Laura"" and ""Tom"", were going to change and I kind of just followed the flow. 

The first year, I befriend a girl, ""Emma"", and we kissed, I had this sexuality discovery, but that was as far as it got at the time. I made a bunch of new friends, and, one weekend when my dad was out of town (my parents are divorced) I decided to make a little party for one of these friends, but it got out of control, became really big and Emma was assault by a guy, she never said anything to me about it, Laura told me a few months later. 

Emma changed schools the next year, we kept in touch, but not as much. We reunited when after we graduated from high school, she lives in front of my university, so we started to meet up all the time and I ended up falling for her and we had a kind-of-relationship, it was never official and we didn't 'do' much, sometimes we kissed, but that went on for two years. 

I was really chill about it, I mean, I wasn't in a rush to make anything offical, because neither she or me had come out for our families, for me, it's kind of easier, because my family is supportive, but Emma's is really homophobic, so she wasn't in a rush to do it, she wanted to be more stable to do it, and I didn't mind waiting for her, we never made an agreement, but, for me, it was kind of a given that we would become official when she was stable and not so dependent of them. Also, we never talked about what happened in my dad's place, I tried to talk about it sometimes, but she always changed subjects, she wasn't offended by it, but it was clear she didn't want to talk about it, and I also never pressure too much into, I never really told her I knew, for example, but what happened really haunted me (and her, I'm sure, it's not like it has more impact on me than on her, I'm not trying to be a jerk); I, to this day, feel very guilty about it, and it was important to me that, before we became official, we talked about that.

I guess it's not really a shock what comes next, but for me it was, she started dating, like, officially. I remember her telling me about the guy the first time, but I really dismissed, because it wasn't rare, we weren't exclusive, and I really didn't care, I felt like it wasn't a problem, because we were bound to be together, so, yeah, I really didn't care. After that, we broke it off whatever we had, we didn't have a fight, but I asked her to break up with him, and she said she liked him and wanted to date-date, so, yeah, we are still friends, she broke with him a year after that and now is dating somebody else. I realized that I had the relationship I had with her I had basically alone, I was very delusional, and yeah, that's that, not much I can do.

Sorry this is so messy? I had to contextualize some thing, because after this 'break up' I started eating in a very unhealthy way and sometimes binged - this actually began when I started uni, I got really stressed because my university was on strike for almost one year and a half, but after the break with Emma it got really worse. Not since childhood I was thin, but I was chubby, like 'girl-next-door' fat, but it got out of control, to me becoming really heavy.

Now, thought, I'm almost finishing university. This is my last year. And I lost a lot of weight, almost 30 pounds in last eight months, after my grandfather, who I was close (I lived with him more than half of my life!) died. I started eating healty and exercising and everybody is proud of me - even my father, who told me one day that nobody would ever rape me because of how fat I was -, I do all this healthy stuff and I feel like my quality of life got better, but I started vomiting almost every two to four days, mostly when I eat unhealthly, it's a really unhealthy habit, I know, but I'm a really stressed person and I feel better when I do it, I know my weight lost is not only because of the healthy habits, that the vomiting played a part, but I feel like I can't tell nobody.

And, finally, - it's almost over!, I have a therapist, I started seeing her before me and Emma broke up, and she really helps me, I am a very stressed person, specially about college, I'm very dedicated and I get really stressed because of it. Now, although, I'm almost finishing it, and I want to talk to her about the things that happened to me, like the assault, and the times I tried suicide and, now, the vomiting, but I can't, I feel like a literally can't, I'm feel trapped inside myself, like I'm suffocating myself until I give up talking, I never told anyone any of this, my friends talk to me about their mental health, assaults and etc. and I never tell anything. 

I, also, sometimes wonder if I have a mental illness, but my therapist never talked about it with me, so I don't know if is because I don't have it or if is because I literally can't talk anything too deep, as if I never gave her the chance to consider it. She knows some stuff, she knows about the party that I lost control of, but I never told her about what happened to Emma, she knows about my weight lost, but now about the vomiting, she doesn't know about the assault, but she knows I stress eat, and I never told her about the times I tried to kill myself. But I want to tell her, she told me one session that I have laid out a lot stuff, but we never went too deep, like I had some kind of block, I don't want to have it, I want to talk, badly, but I feel out of breath just thinking about talking, I really really want help, but I'm also very afraid that I don't need it, and that's just life, and if it is, what do I do? Is it worth it?

What do I do? I feel like a mess, I'm feeling like this for a long time, and now I'm wondering if that is actually how life is. I really want help, but I'm throwing in the thrash my therapist, the chance I have of maybe being better, I don't want to do it, but I really don't know how to deal with my mental health, I feel very alienated of everything.

25,"I am a 16 year old,  and I feel so apathetic about everything. I used to be someone who found people to be interesting. I used to truly love people. Even though I have social anxiety being around people truly did make me happy. It would make me uncomfortable because of my irrational fears, but I deeply cared about others.

I would never harm another person or anything along those lines. But, I feel like I am losing the empathetic person that I once was. I feel scared and so worried. I find myself not wanting to be around people at all, and I would rather just stay home alone, all day, everyday. 

Apathy is taking me over. My apathy isn’t allowing me to enjoy life or feel remotely satisfied or happy with anything. I don’t care about others like I used to. Sometimes I get in this really mean state of mind. I feel disgusting for it. I am becoming this really vile person.

I don’t want to talk to anyone. I don’t want to see anyone. I don’t want to do anything. The only thing keeping me afloat currently is my grades. I force myself to make good grades, because it is the only thing currently giving me satisfaction in my life.

28,"If you feel down, depressed, anxious, worried about something. Just remember it won’t last forever &amp; things do certainly get better.

This is the case for myself. On the 6th of January my life turned upside down, very fast, very quickly...

I was in a very controlling relationship, very abusive &amp; was always questioned &amp; harassed about anything &amp; everything. My now ex-girlfriend (girlfriend at the time) was going through some legal issues surrounding her children &amp; her ex-husband. Her Ex-husband was very jealous of the relationship between myself &amp; her, so he decided to take her to court &amp; then gained full custody of his children, but unfortunately I came under fire from her for being the cause, when it had nothing to do with me. Her jealous ex-husband took her children, he claimed legal aid (UK) under Domestic Violence even though he was lying through his teeth (was proven) &amp; she couldn’t afford a lawyer.

So she started to blame me for her loosing her children, which really was not fair at all. It progressively got worse, with me having to pay her bills, as she was paying for a solicitor. For some context, I kind of knew this was going to happen &amp; I tried to tell her several times, but she basically had her head up her arse &amp; wasn’t having any of it. 

Then on the 6th of January, we had a massive argument (basically because I had enough of her blaming me for shit all the time &amp; I snapped) 

I packed my rucksack with a few items such as underwear, socks, clothes etc, but in the process of doing so, she smashed my mobile phone &amp; laptop. She then threatened to call the police, so I put my motorcycle leathers on, jumped on the bike &amp; left immediately &amp; drove to my friends house (45 minutes away) as fast as my motorbike could manage. 

Anyway, the next day the police arrived &amp; I was arrested for Criminal Damage. I spent all day in the police cells &amp; was interviewed (which was hilarious if I’m honest). During the police interview, it turns out that she told them I smashed my phone &amp; that I smashed the laptop also. For context, she had given me this laptop as a Christmas gift.

So during the police interview I was being questioned &amp; the interviewing officer asked me about the laptop &amp; burst out laughing, simply for the reason being was she had told them a complete web of lies to make me look bad. I explained everything &amp; I even cracked a few jokes during the interview (yes I have weird coping mechanisms) was released with No Further Charge (rightfully so) &amp; I left, or at least tried to....

Turns out that I had a diary that I used to write all my thoughts into (mental health worries etc). Turns out she had given this to the police officers &amp; they then arrested me again under the mental health act &amp; took me to hospital. I was nearly sectioned but manage to not get sectioned as I had to lie through my teeth to be able to be released. So I finally was released from Police Custody &amp; custody of the hospital.

I then returned back to my friends house (where I was arrested from) just trying to piece together everything that had happened over the past 2 days. 

Now onto the good bit....

I’m very lucky to have a very small group of biker friends who I know I can rely on, as I was broke &amp; penniless as she had taken everything from me... my friends gave me a spare phone &amp; my friend is putting me up for free which is awesome.

My finances are now sorted &amp; it’s so nice to have like £1,000 per month that is MINE, I don’t need to spend it on anyone else. Just going to use some of it to pay for a food shop for where I’m staying &amp; to put money on electric as it is the correct thing to do, because I’m a thoughtful person.

But I’m now getting help from my local authority,
I’m registered with a local Doctors surgery &amp; everything is slowly coming together &amp; I am so much happier for leaving that absolutely terrible situation. 

Without my friends, I honestly wouldn’t be here right now.

TL;DR Had enough of being in an abusive relationship, so left. Restarted my life &amp; couldn’t be happier. 

Also, on a side note, if your partner is controlling, leave, run, run, run away... you may not think you are able to... but I managed, I left that terrible situation with absolutely zero cash to my name, but my friends were kind enough to help me out &amp; slowly but surely, I’m back to being me again. 

If anyone reading this is feeling depressed or you’re in a controlling relationship &amp; you need to vent, talk, discuss how you feel, I’m only a private message away, message me anytime &amp; I will reply to your message as quickly as I can. I hate seeing people treated like shit. 

Just remember, someone cares about you &amp; you should know that someone is me, I have never met you, I don’t know you. But I care :)

30,"I'm really picky. 
Like, extremely picky.

I CANNOT wear cool tones. Sometimes it's acceptable depending on if the color is more warm leaning or cool leaning, but if my outfit doesnt fit my niche than I'm ugly. I cant wear pants that are too tight. Also, no jeans. Ever. Unless they're an acceptable style or shade. 

If I end up going outside and I feel a bit off with how I look, I get irrationally irritable and start picking at my skin. I get the urge to rip off what I'm wearing. I feel violent towards myself. I feel like something bad will happen to me or someone I love. I thought my shoes didnt match my outfit the other day and I couldnt walk. I froze. I had to spend the day thinking about how stupid i look.

I've gotten better with colors. I used to feel sick if something in my possession was blue. I couldnt buy any products with blue packaging at all. Now, if theres a problem, I make sure to pair it with something that's a complimenting color. If its leaning more towards teal, I'm a bit more okay with it. The WORST color is purple. Cant stand it. 

I love orange. I love green. I love yellow. Brown, gold, white. Pink is okay sometimes. Red is okay sometimes. Some things are okay sometimes if presented well.

If specific things remind me of certain colors, I wont touch it. My meals need to coordinate well throughout the day. 

If a task includes numbers, I feel a lot better if it's in odd numbers. If I'm washing dishes, I make sure I stop dispensing soap on an odd number. If I'm buying a meal, I'll get 3 things. If I'm texting something, I'll do it in groups of 3. I really like the number 3. 

I need to make such an effort to be myself. All the time. Everything NEEDS to coordinate with who I am. I need to buy certain looking things. I need to look a certain way. I need to do certain things. I need to go certain places. I need to eat certain things. 

I just cant tell when it's just preference, or a problem.",27Jan2020,1

32,"I typed this up and deleted it several times.  Avoiding posting a giant story.

A young(18) friend is having girlfriend problems.  Both of them have historical issues - dropped out of HS, a lot of drug use other than weed, homelessness.  


A few weeks ago I referred the girlfriend to a social worker when she showed up from out of town.  
She was given access to some resources.  


My friend blew up his life sort of for her - re-dropped out of highschool, burned bridges with his family, staring to burn bridges with his friends including the one who graciously accepted them into his apartment trying to turn their lives around.  


I have no idea if it will work out for them.  When it seems like it won't - she's almost gotten booted out of the apartment, her mom has almost come to pick her up, etc - my friend freaks out.  


Starts rocking back and forth, rips off his clothes, pulls on his hair, pupils get dilated, starts crying,  mumbling shuts down, goes catatonic for some time.  


Uhh...his mom wants to do a mental health arrest...I've talked her down a few times...I feel like it won't help....and it will probably blow up his job prospects that he has lined up now...he might get his life on some kind of track again.  


If...she has to go....either to to foster care, her mom's, or a women's shelter.....my friend will flip.  Will want to again blow up his life.    


I...almost have him convinced to see a therapist...he doesn't want drugs...professionals maybe can help him with psychological flexibility or better coping behaviors...  


If it happens again.....do we stop him from making more horrible decisions, like going homeless, abandoning the job he just accepted, etc?  It won't take a lot of persuasion.  When he's like that he has no energy.  Stand in front of him with an arm out and he melts to the ground in tears.  
His family is content on letting him make his own decisions...but I can't even call what he does in these moments decisions....

It's not me being genuine and then them being bothered by that. It's me bothering them and them being bothered by that. 

But I feel like I cant stop. I'm always so afraid when I act genuine or more normal that they wont like me, or theyll still find me annoying when I'm mellow. I'm so scared of it.

39,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I've had this feeling my entire life - and well obviously it's preventing me from fully living my life.  I don't know where else to ask, so I was hoping that one of you guys can either point me in the right direction.  Maybe you know what feeling I am dealing with or what issue I am dealing with.  I do see a therapist for other stuff but unless you feel what I am feeling, it's hard to relate.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, my entire life feels fake.  Everything, from friends, from work, from going to the gym, from playing video games, from playing sports, from my relationships, everything is fake.  I don't feel a lot of emotions and I feel like a zombie most of the time.  My emotions are muted and it seems like my life is just going through the motions.

Every once in awhile, however, I do feel something else.  I will feel this sense of despair, loneliness, a yearning for something, and vulnerability.  This emotion that I feel (not sure what it's called) is probably the realest emotion I ever feel.  When I feel this, I feel real and alive.  Obviously it also feels shitty, and so when that emotion really hits me hard, I have a tendency to shutdown by mindlessly playing video games or something.  

But the thing is, I've felt this emotion my entire life.  And while sometimes it causes me to shutdown, it's also the realest emotion I can ever feel and so I'm not exactly in a hurry to get rid of it, because I feel alive.  Unfortunately, it can prohibit me from being productive, and, not knowing what to do with that emotion and not know what I can do to make myself feel better, I just go about my normal life.  I do homework, read, go to the gym, hang out with friends, eat, etc... basically go about a ""normal"" life.  

But everthing I do, hanging out with friends, going to shows, etc...always has this fakeness to it.  It all feels like a huge distraction and hence my entire life feels fake.

&amp;#x200B;

So what is going on?  When i feel that emotion, what should I do?  How do I feel better when I am feeling that way?  Heck, what is it that I am feeling?  I have never been able to find someone else the feels the same way I do.",27Jan2020,1

A few months ago I finally worked up the courage to go to the doctor to get put on medication for severe social anxiety, anxiety, and depression.  I tried out a few different SSRIs and SNRIs, but everything made me feel worse and I couldn’t get out of bed.  We finally found one medication that was ok.  So the doctor raised my dose to see if it helped more, and referred me to a psychiatrist to get another opinion on medication and such.  When I went to the appointment with the psychiatrist, she made me cry the entire time. She basically told me that I was enabling myself to have all of this anxiety and that they only way I’m going to not feel anxious and depressed is to not stay in bed all day and avoid things. The psychiatrist made me feel worse than before, and like my feelings were completely invalid, and didn’t want to switch my meds because “med’s aren’t a magic solution, you actually have to stop feeling how you do”. So I left that appointment feeling like it was a complete waste of time and believing that my feelings aren’t valid and that I should “just get over it”. 

So at this point I’m not really sure what to do next.  My current meds are going to run out in a few weeks and I need to figure out what to do.  Should I go see a doctor to get a refill of the meds(my current doctor is on maternity leave so I can’t see her)? I know if I see a doctor to get a refill they’re going to ask if the meds are helping, and honestly they really aren’t. So where do I go from here?

46,"Okay so I don’t know where else to put this so I thought I’d put it here as I believe it stems from depression.

 Ever since I was young I’ve always internalized this thought that nobody could ever truly be satisfied romantically with who I am as a person, that whoever I’m with is always going to be left wanting something that I can’t provide and that’s going to lead to cheating or heartbreak. And I don’t understand why I have this thought process, I’m by no means a model but I’m relatively attractive and by most all accounts I’m a good and interesting person I’m 19 and male by the way. 

But no matter how many times this is told to me and no matter how true I know it is I just simply cannot comprehend the concept of somebody choosing me, of being someone’s first choice as a partner. 

I’ve always felt like I’d be the guy that would end up with a decent looking girl after she had exhausted all other options. And not in like I’m a pleasant surprise way but in a way she has become too weary to try harder than me and that I’ll “do”.

I just feel like I’ll be able to be fully in love with someone but I’ll never get that in return. I’ve just developed such a bleak outlook about my future prospects as far as love goes. It’s become something I ruminate on daily and I don’t know why, I feel like it can’t be true but even newton died alone.  I just don’t understand why I can’t get this out of my head that I’ll never find someone who is satisfied by what I have to offer. Like I know I do have a lot to offer somebody and that I’m a kind hearted person but I just feel like that won’t ever be enough for someone.

That just being a good person isn’t enough, that I have to always be funny and approachable and always be fun and basically have to mutilate my own personality to be desirable and that prospect is just so depressing to me that in order to be attractive, I can’t be me, I have to pretend. I have to seclude myself into a corner of my mind and let my real self out only when I’m alone like a husky kept in a kennel all day.

I don't know if something's wrong with me, my brain is trying to tell me something, or what. But I just want to know if anybody else has had or has these kind of things happen and if they know what it it. All I want to do is move on from what happened and enjoy what I have right now but I just can't for some reason.",27Jan2020,1
50,"I’m 17 and for a while now I’ve been worried about my mental health and I’m conflicted on what to do. I’ve talked to a couple of friends and they’re telling me things and saying I should go to the doctor but I don’t want to go to the doctor if what I’m experiencing is just being a teenager. 

I have anxiety which has always been known to me, my family, and my doctor. But things I have thought were normal are starting to feel like they’re not. Explaining it isn’t easy, I’m not sure what should be pointed out and what shouldn’t, these things seem so normal to me, even if they do feel horrible. 

To start I’m not trying to “self-diagnose” on here, I just want to know what could be possibly wrong with me, if anything. 
Quite a lot I shift from a depressed feeling to a up and jumpy, excited feeling. The depressed feeling can be  really bad, the worst part will normally last about 1-2 weeks. I will feel like everything’s hopeless and start to think of a world without me. This is extremely horrible, especially when the day before I could feel on top of the world. When like this sometimes, not an enormous amount though, I will hear things that aren’t there. This isn’t just voices, it can be car sounds, animals making noises, or just everyday city sounds. This i knew wasn’t normal, but since it didn’t happen a lot I kinda just dealt with it. 

On the other side there’s time’s when I’m seen as being overly happy and I’ve noticed that it can happen at times that I shouldn’t be happy, even if it’s a sad thing, I will feel happy but knowing that I’m sad at the same time if that makes sense. When I say happy I don’t just mean “oh today was a good day” I mean “ today was an excellent day. I can do anything”. It’s hard to explain properly why this happens. But like I said it can be at time that maybe be inappropriate, for Instance, I lost contact with my sister about a year ago and when I realised I sort of felt on an huge high. I went out more, started different hobbies and just enjoyed random things more. I felt extremely sad about the situation and it always felt there, but I wasn’t upset the way my family was. This was until a couple weeks went by and I went into a depressive feeling, I had a breakdown about it. I begged my friend to let me die and I started hating myself cause my sister was gone. Again everything felt hopeless.

Right now I’m in a mixed feeling, I feel happy but at the same time sad, it’s a weird feeling to explain. It’s kind of like listening to a song you love or doing something you love but has sad memories with it, if that makes sense. 

I know this has been quite long and I appreciate you reading this, if you have any advice or even similar experiences please comment. Hopefully I might gain some insight(without the self diagnosing)

Thank you!",27Jan2020,1

I hate being here, I just never talk to her because its gonna be the worst, I've tried to connect to her so many times but she just doesn't care about me or my opinions, I recently got a girlfriend and my mom didn't even care that I did but my dad was psyched and asked me all about her but my mom didn't ask a single question become she doesn't give a shit about my life, I feel like I'm living with someone who just cant feel joy around me, she is always trying to make me think my dad is awful when in reality my dad is not that bad, he drinks yeah, but so does she
I cant even have a normal conversation without her saying she has a headphones and telling me to leave her alone, im seeing it happen to my little sister, she is constantly being told to be quiet and shut up so all she does is stay on her tablet, my mother didn't raise me, the internet did. I say I love you to her so much in Hope's that she just would say it to me more but she never did, I feel like she just doesn't care that I exist I know I'm the middle child and I apparently get thr least love but I dont get anything, my girlfriend showed me what being loved is like and it felt amazing, I never feel this way around my mom, my dad shows love too, I get along with my dad a lot because we have the same sense of humor and my dad always asks me how I'm doing whenever I see him, I haven't been asked how I'm doing by my mother in years, she only cares about my school life when I'm failing and I've been sad so many times in my life and shes never been there for me, I feel like I'm just some roommate to her, I feel like I'm nothing to her",27Jan2020,1

54,"I’m 32 m that’s dealt with major depression with psychotic features - as well as general anxiety disorder - for 3 years now. I believe it all started with the death of my mom (cancer) 10 years ago or the diagnosis of hsv2 (herpes) 3.5 years ago. Been through the hospital twice for psychotic episodes in the last 3 years, been on anti psychotic meds and antidepressants. Have gone to therapy and am active physically. I’m a big introvert and being social is something I struggle with. I think depression will always be a struggle.

55,"I’m not long on this subreddit and I’ve never made a reddit post so forgive me if I’m getting something wrong but I need help. I am diagnosed with BPD but it’s a messier part of my medical notes I’m having trouble with. I started going to the psychiatrist reporting visual and auditory hallucinations, delusions and paranoia. I was given no possible explanation for my symptoms but was put on an antipsychotic ‘for stress’. the antipsychotic did nothing but worsen my symptoms (according to my loved ones, not me) and I stopped taking it. Another slightly less apathetic psychiatrist told me I certainly sounded like I had symptoms of psychosis but I was far too ‘calm and gathered’ about them, whatever that means. I face my problems alone and without any idea of what they are or what causes them. It is common (at least 1-2 nights a week) that I will start to feel intense fear and dread in the night time. I will feel as though something has its eyes on me and that no matter what I mustn’t go to sleep. I shake, sweat, my heart rate is up significantly, my mouth is dry. I can never recognise these episodes while they are happening. One time I lay in the dark for 5 hours in a cold room shaking and intermittently weeping, practically paralysed with fear. I had no idea how much time had passed. I had a hallucination that I turned into an inhuman being. I felt like I’d seen something I wasn’t supposed to and my view of myself and the world felt permanently altered by the experience. I have just come out of the back of one of these and although it wasn’t as awful as the one from earlier I described I feel like I’m fighting a losing battle trying to cope with them alone. Does anyone know what I am experiencing, or where I could go? My friends are sweet and try to help but they all seem to think that the concepts I’m sharing are extremely alien. Which is why I’m here I suppose.

But since reddit is anonymous, here I go. I'm really good at the things I do. I was taking college courses on programming when I was 15 and I run a semi-successful YouTube channel on programming tutorials. I also act, sing, and write and have been provided a good amount of opportunities to expose those things from professionals seeing and liking my work.

Now this makes it seem like I've lived an easier life, and could even give people the viewpoint of thinking I don't understand a struggling life.



But that isn't the case. 


I grew up with an abusive father who had hidden cameras installed in our house. When I became an adult I moved out and due to financial struggles became homeless. I lived with my mom who makes no money. I've always been fiscally lower class. I own 1 jacket and 1 pair of jeans and theyre all ripped up. I had a therapist once in my life and she illegally revealed what I talked about to my father, who she was good friends with (I didn't know this during the therapy of course). This elevated my paranoia

I have depression, anxiety, and insomnia issues but I can't afford my medication.

However I stopped thinking about suicide thanks to my psychologist. She told me about this social media site so I come to share what I feel.

All my suicidal thoughts started when at age 5, I accidentally caused an accident which killed my sister. She was my twin, 5 as well. My parents won't stop blaming me for her death. We were playing on my house stairs and I stumbled and made a decoration statue fell on her head. She had seizures and I didn't do anything to save her. When my mom came to help her she was dead. I cannot forgive myself for that even if my psychologist has already told me I'm not the one to blame.

67,"For reference, I’m a second year college student. 

My father died when I was very young. I grew up with my mother and a few older sisters. 

For the longest time I internally blamed my mother for my fathers death even though it was purely of natural causes. I have gotten past this but I think it’s left lasting effects. My sisters and my mother would frequently lash out at me and I think from a young age that enforced a sort of misogyny within me. I was also told to “be a man” a lot in situations that caused me panic. 

Flash forward to high school and my first girlfriend cheated on me. She also would frequently act like I needed to man up about things. 

I think the combination of what happened with her and with my parents had created a deep-seated resentment toward women. For a while I just kinda went with this subconsciously. I still had/have plenty of friends that are girls; however, I had this hatred about me. For example, and your going to hate me for this, but when some girls at my high school accused one of my favorite teachers of sending inappropriate  messages, I absolutely refused to accept it until later when there was undeniable evidence. I also have a very hard time coping if I’m outperformed by a woman in something. I feel incredibly angry toward female figures of authority in my life. I was resentful toward this women’s march in 2017 as well. I (wrongly) felt like it was a misandrist movement. 

About a year ago (freshman year of college), I started seeing this girl and we’ve been together since. I really love this girl, I’ve learned a lot from being with her. I realized how horrible I had become and began to try and change. I was doing well it until the whole Iran thing started. A few weeks ago when the draft fears were going on, I just kinda relapsed and felt an intense hatred toward society because it makes me feel so expendable.

I can’t take this anymore. I don’t want to be sexist anymore. I know that it’s wrong for me to have those thoughts but I just can’t control how I feel.

I’ve been going to therapy for about two years to deal with general life stressors and anxiety. I have been seeing a female therapist. I want to bring this up with her. I am really scared to because 1) this is not an empathizable issue and 2) I am scared of judgement. I know she wouldn’t overtly judge me, but I’m scared it will make her see me as a fundamentally shitty person, which I know I have been, but I’m trying to fix that. So how can I go about this?",27Jan2020,1
68,"Hello, I made this throwaway account because I really wanted to come on here and get some insight and advice on my current situation. I’m currently a high school senior and I have not been doing so well for the past few years. During my sophomore year, I started noticing that my mental health was declining gradually. To give you a bit of a background, I live in a house with very strict, narcissistic parents. I think of my house like a prison because the only places I’m allowed to go are school, church, and anywhere else I must be with one of my parents or older siblings. For the sake of time, I’m not going to go into too much detail, but I’ve had to grow up around a lot of physical and verbal abuse in my house, primarily done by my father (also mention that my parents are Caribbean). Growing up, I’ve basically been neglected in terms of not having emotionally available parents, I only had parents who fed me, gave me shelter, and gave me clothes. I added this info in because I feel as though this is what is causing me problems.

Basically, with my current situation, I’m in a spot where I can’t tell if I’m showing symptoms of a mental illness or if I’m just being lazy and trying to make myself believe that there’s something wrong with me to justify my behavior. I’ve had moments where I would think to myself “what if nothing is wrong with me and everything that I believe is mentally wrong with me is just not true?” I haven’t been handing in assignments on time anymore and it makes me feel so guilty. I constantly cry because I get these recurring anxious thoughts, and one of the most common ones is that the teachers who I have now will talk to the teachers I had previously and talk about my low work ethic. It may sound ridiculous to some, but I can’t stop these thoughts from constantly reappearing. I try hard to stay motivated to do my work, but either I blank out and stare at my computer screen/wall or I go to sleep for long periods of time and wake up exhausted to the point where I don’t even want to bother doing the assignment that day. I always have the problem where I come home from  school and I’ll cry to the point of exhaustion or just feel so numb and end up waking up around 9-10 PM and staying up till 3-4 AM trying to do homework or study. I can’t talk to a therapist as of right now because my parents will never let me see one (and that includes my school psychologist - I would need parental consent first). I’ve been holding onto the thought that I’ll be able to leave for college soon and that I’ll be able to seek help then, but I don’t know what to do right now. I don’t understand why I keep feeling the way I do because I used to be the student who always handed in her work on time, if not early. At first I thought it was just a case of “senioritis” but there are times where I feel as though that isn’t the case.

My mental health is in shambles. Where to start. Lets start with the academic stuff. My grades suck. They are terrible, yet I cant study. I simply idly scroll by in reddit, read novels/manga, watch YouTube. When Im on the verge of breaking down at my own patheticness, and force myself to study and do my homework. I cant. 
Every second I spend trying to makes my head hurt, and its not hurting due to overworking. Its this uncomfortable, nagging pain that numbs my brain and makes it hard to think. This numbing pain is combined with a longing to do literally anything else. Go have a snack, check my phone, go to sleep, it doesnt matter. Every fiber of my brain wants to run away because I am simply incapable of studying. You might be thinking I might just be retarded. But Im not, atleast not in the sense of being dumb. Lazy? Definetly. Foolish? Indeed. But I can comfortably make deductions and observations and think smart when I do something I enjoy, like games or trying to understand a character in my favourite book. Yet when it comes to studying, I just cant. Atleast not when doing homework. Within the class, theres still a nagging to escape and not do it, but if I ignore it I can still enjoy listening to the teacher and trying to come up with smart answers/observations. I like doing that, it makes me feel a little useful and productive you could say, since there is always either praise from someone or a feeling of accomplishment. Sitting alone in my room doing homework on a subject I hate doesnt. I hate it. It makes me nauseous. You might be thinking ""why not pick up something you like?"" There isnt. I hate the very concept of work and study. All subjects, and any activity,I hate them all. Why I dont know, I used to enjoy it. Perhaps I enjoyed the company rather than the activity, but now I dont. And as expected, my reports are usually C, Ds or even Fs. I might get a B or A if its an easy subject like Spanish, but thats about it. Im 18, in Upper Sixth, following the British curriculum, though Im not british or in Britain. 

Now, my social life. Its in shambles. I have no friends. Not online, not  in real life. Why? In real life, because I talk to nobody, and nobody talks to me. I used to have friends, but then changed schools for a year for personal reasons. Had a couple of superficial buddies there. Then returned to my old school, yet we were now distant and awkward. We hanged out at first and chatted, but grew apart. Now its not surprising if I spend my day having uttered literally 0 words outside of the classroom. We used to geek out over games, but my parents took them away when I was 17 and then ""forgot"" where they put it. I havent asked since, since I know its for the best. Yet now I dont follow their conversations. Im not interested in random celebrities who Ive never met. I dont care about some dudes kicking a ball around. No, Im not buying the 20th FIFA game that looks exactly like the 19th but slightly tweaked. No, I dont want to go smoke weed and do drugs with you. 
Due to my clashing interests, we stopped talking, and I stopped getting invited to their parties, which I used to attend to play games, hang out or drink. After having spent half a year in solitude, Ive lost my ability to socialise, in the sense that I have no tact of social queues (or perhaps never did) and talk about things nobody cares about, and I dont care about what they are into. I tried to be respectful and lend an ear, but obviously we dont share the interests. I now have trouble even producing my voice. Usually the first spoken words of the day are hard to pronounce because my voice chords feel strange when used, and I end up saying it weird until I get used to my voice. If on a holiday, I may spend the whole week without speaking even once, other than my own mutterings to myself.

At home, I'm alone nearly all day. My mom is in another country with my sister due to family problems. Before they simply fought, so atleast its quiet now. I live with my dad, but he  always either comes home in the morning/late night, or not at all. Every time he comes, he is either drunk or drugged. He does cocaine. And also often visits prostitutes. When my mom found out it was the breaking point. (She felt it weird how he is never home, and how his eyes were sometimes glaced, so she investigated, noticed the odd white powder he sometimes had, and got mad, trying to make him stop. He promised he would. He didnt. Then she installed a GPS in his car to know where he drives, and found him driving to brothels. That was the last nail on the coffin. They are now unofficially divorced. Why am I sharing this? Because theres nobody else to share it with. This is an outpour of half a years worth of locked up emotions. A tangent of tangents.) Well, back to the point. Im alone all day at home too. And even when Im not, I dont speak to my dad because Im socially inept, and the age barrier means our interests clash. Also, its hard to talk to drunk people. But dont misuderstand. He isnt a bad father. He isnt abusive, and he works to earn us money. He is just messed up, just like me. As such we arent poor. In fact you could say we are more mid-upper class, since we can afford a small home on rent in a nice neighbour quite close to the beach. Not that I ever go there.

Ive also got a music addiction. When I wake up, I wake up to the sound of the music in my earphones. If not, I put them on and get out of bed. While Im having breakfast, I listen to music. When I go to school, I listen to music. When Im in class, I listen to music if we are allowed. When Im on break or during a self study/free period, I listen to music. On my way home, I listen to music. At home, I listen to music. When I lay down to go to bed, I turn on my music and fall asleep to it. And its rarely relaxing. I usually listen to heroic, epic, instense or energetic music. Why? It helps boost my morale enough to keep going. Stuff like the Demon Slayer OST, Persona music, boss fight themes, Dark souls, or Mili tracks if I feel like being even more depressed. And I need to listen to music all the time. Otherwise, my thoughts become dark and complicated. And I start thinking about depressing things. Every second without music makes me more depressed. I need the loud music to drown out my thoughts and liquify my worries. This also plays a factor in why I dont talk to people anymore. Im always listening to music and/or on my phone. The internet also helps dumb down my excessively complicated thoughts or focus them on enjoying something else and thinking hard about something else. 

Ive got every depression symptom. When Im not listening to music, I am always very sad and depressed, and my thoughts can casually shift to suicidal ones. Im also absolutely fearless of death. In other words I couldnt care less if I die some day. I have 0 self preservation desires. Instead its the opposite, I have sacrificial urges. I assume this is because my life is so empty I want to go out by protecting someone. If I ever see somebody about to get hit by a truck, I can absolutely guarantee I would throw myself in the middle to defend them and selfishly end my life in a more meaningful way, having saved a life. Ah, getting isekaied also seems like an interesting prospect.
And obviously as you could tell from before, I am constantly anxious. Even if Im very good at having a passive mask of nonchalance in real life, not that anybody cares to check my wellbeing though.   Im also always tired, no matter whether I slept well or not. Sleeping well simply erases physical fatigue, but my mind still always feels exhausted.
I also have very bad sleeping patterns. Either I dont sleep at all, sleep very little, or sleep a lot. When theres no school, the sunlight outside my window is what notifies me that I should go to sleep. For example, today I went to sleep at 2pm. And woke up at 8pm. My eating habits are also terrible. As you would expect, there is 0 regard for a balanced meal. If Im entertained on my laptop, then spending the whole day without eating is nothing unusual. But if Im bored I might spend all day snacking on cookies or the like. I eat only to shut up the pain if I feel it or to pass time and avoid responsibilities.

Theres so much more I could tell you about my messed up self, but this would turn into a proper novel if I do that. This is the overview, more or less. I was planning on contacting a doctor and asking for antidepressants or something. Im just generally a failure of a human being, messed up in the head and thoroughly lazy. I thank you for reading through this slog of filth and disappointment. If you've got some advice, that would be very much appreciated, but I honestly just wanted to express myself a little. My emotions have been becoming damper. I dont feel rage, hatred, jealousy or other such emotions, except for the ocasional pang when seeing somebody happy. I myself also dont particularly feel ever joy or happiness. Just sadness or that empty feeling of satisfaction when Im enjoying reading or watching something. That feeling of entertainment. If I see something funny I laugh, but that is only temporary. I don't actually stop feeling depressed. Nonetheless, even when I feel sad, I have trouble expressing it. When my mom tried to kill herself. I felt very sad and guilty, yet I couldnt cry. On the other hand, I had no trouble sobbing over some poor souls fate in my manga. In other words, my emotions are also messed up. Im sick in the head.  

Thank you for listening. Please help me. My greatest social enjoyment is opening up the notifications of a website or app and reading the comments people leave behind, even if half the time they are insulting me and shitting on my opinion or point of view. I also enjoy arguing in the internet, even if its with idiots, or if I am being the idiot. Thats because Im that starved to socialize. If a classmate ocasionally acknowledges my existence I get a pang of happiness that I otherwise dont experience. Way too exagerated for how I should be feeling.

That is all. If you want to ask me something else in the comments. Feel free to do so, I absolutely dont mind answering them, even if only to pass the time or have a semblance of a convo.",27Jan2020,1

81,"Growing up I thought people could only be depressed when they were older so depression at like 7-8 felt normal to me up until I turned 15. 

Sometimes I look back on freshman year even and think “Holy shit I was really depressed then” and every time I think that, I realize I kinda still am. I’m not dysfunctional, I do things I like, and people who talk about signs of depression could never realize it’s me (ik it’s just my case but still). 

It’s this weird thing where during school I’m this “class-clown” funny guy, I get excited about things and I’m always laughing, and the minute I have time to myself I feel everything. (And I never want to hang out with people outside of school even if we’re real chill inside, so that’s a lot)

Idk what it is but I’ve been having feelings like this practically forever, but when I remember my childhood (I’m still just 17) I don’t really think about depression being a factor; it’s like it’s so engrained into me that I don’t even notice it. People don’t know and I don’t really want them to. 

Besides, I always get over it eventually - I’ve had entire years where I feel good the whole time. Maybe the weirdest thing about this is that a lot of people know me for having dry-humor and my family thinks I’m kinda emotionless (in a jokey way). But I couldn’t be any more different. I feel everything just never gave a shit to show it. 

The amazing this is that anyone I know reading this would be so fucking clueless, and wouldn’t believe it. People talk about friends of theirs who have been depressed and I can just tell they think I’ve never felt it, and I play along. I might not even post this shit cuz it won’t do shit for me.

And please, I know I should see a therapist or something, but just don’t leave a comment saying it - I won’t be mad or anything I just honestly hope no one comments at all. I don’t need a pat on the back, and I’ve accepted who I am. 

So fuck it, I’m gonna start figuring out how to get over this depression shit, I’m not gonna let it fuck with me anymore. Jesus Christ just writing this I’m starting to have some type of revelation. I don’t deserve to feel like shit all the time and bear all the weight. Time to find out what’ll really keep me happy.

When i was first born, my mother had my grandparents to take care of me for a couple years. I love them so much. But when they both passed away, i didnt mourn for about a week. Not one little tear. It was hard for me to talk to them while he was dead in the hospital, everyone was able to but not me. But then something clicked. I was driving home one morning and i drove past my grandpas house. Forgetting that hes dead, i was thinking ""havent seen him in awhile, i need to visit him"". Then it hit me, ""oh thats right...hes gone"". Then i started crying my eyes out in the car while driving home. I almost felt embarrassed having people see me while im a mess. (Im shedding tears just typing this right now)

DAY. to practice in my garage, park or a 24 hr gym. I spent the whole day thinking about my past and it wasnt until now, saying ""Kobe is dead"". I started crying in my kitchen.

93,"A Burnout isn't something that suddenly pops up but something that comes little by little. A longtime before it escalates the body sends warning signals and tells us ""Hey, pay attention, the direction you are taking is leading to a destination you don't wanna end up"".   
You FEEL that there is an imbalance (emotionally and in your body). You are having trouble to release your everyday stress, problems motivating yourself and difficulties to focus.   
Attacks of sweating, headaches, neck pain and backache are often accompanying sympthoms.    


Even though we kinda feel that something is out of order, we try to persevere and continue to do what we do.  Yes, that works, but only until the last drops of your fuel are used up.   
At this point, it is going very fast -everything collapses, like a house of cards, and what's left is a pile of fragments.    


The very first step in prevention is noticing these FEELINGS and signals and stop suppressing them.  Everybody has some stressful days, but if it is something that is gaining the upper hand you can FEEL it!    


So why is it that we don't listen to those signals? Why is it not okay to feel vulnerable and admit that we are exhausted?

96,"Hi all, sorry if this is a dumb question haha.

In a lot of social situations I'm *relatively* fine, this is something that has improved very slowly over time, for instance I'm good/okay at socialising with new people if I have plenty of friends that I trust around me. However there are other situations where I completely struggle to the point where I'd say it significantly hinders my quality of life.
Some examples of this include:
* public speaking: the last time I tried to speak publicly I had what I think was a panic attack. My hands were trembling to the point where I dropped my notes once. I also swore instinctively after every mistake I made which only exacerbated my poor performance haha. I probably blushed too.
* talking to women: this is probably my biggest crux as far as mental health is concerned. It feels like I literally cannot approach new women because I'm terrified that they'll find me boring/repulsive/obnoxious etc. I can talk to women in a friendly context but approaching new women genuinely feels impossible.
* Dependence on alcohol to appear even somewhat sociable: social situations are impossible unless I'm drunk. Even talking to my flatmates is a lot harder, though I find it sorta easier to be open with some people depending on the person and the situation. I would probably be extremely anxious if I ever went to a party sober.
* Over-analysis of literally the tiniest mistakes: this probably doesn't need much explanation, and I know a lot of people do this but I've recently been chastising myself mentally / out loud in private by swearing at myself and calling myself an idiot even if the mistake is extremely minor.
* Terribly low self esteem
* feeling anxious whenever I'm ""forced"" to be expressive: e.g. whenever I get dragged up to dance I usually find it very awkward and I may begin to panic, this often leads me to leave early.
* Leaving social situations early.
* Having a hard time expressing my opinion around people about serious issues because I think they'll consider my opinion to be irrelevant and idiotic.
* Being singled out of a group in public to answer a question. 
* Not being expressive when I'm sober: Usually this leads me to being over expressive when I'm drunk.
* taking over the phone to a friend: For whatever reason if I can't see the person's face I have a hard time talking with them/ being open. This isn't an issue for people I've never met before/ talking to company reps oddly enough.
*  **interviews**: Yeah this is a bad one lol. Inexperience + anxiety = a bad time.

I'm sure this list isn't comprehensive. Any advice would be great.",27Jan2020,1
97,"This will be a long one but I'll try to include everything that may be relevant. For background, there is no background. I have NOT been to a therapist and the one time I tried going to a school counselor I absolutely hated it mostly cause that counselor and I already had bad blood from earlier in the school year. In 8th grade my mom asked if I needed therapy and in my panic I said no. I really wish my mom ""forced"" me to because i really needed it. Freshman year of highschool or so when I almost asked for therapy again, my brother had to start therapy. That's his story so I wont say it, but I wanted my brother to get the help rather than me. And in junior year of highschool I asked for therapy and well... my mother laughed. Really hurt. Now onto the story. Oh also I have adhd and dont take any medication for it because all the ones I tried worked, however I always got very very anxious as a side effect and I hated feeling that when the medicine was in effect.


Let's start from the beginning. I have two older brothers. The oldest is currently 22, and the middle is currently 19, and I am currently 18 and the only girl. Around 8-10 years old my parents were on and off. I would wake up to them whisper screaming at each other. It truly did hurt to see them doing that.  At 11 or 12 they officially broke up (I would say divorced but to this day I'm very confused if they officially got divorced or not. They both say different things but it doesnt really matter.)

I guess you could say I stuck with my mom. My brothers stuck with my dad mostly. My parents worked out seeing us every other weekend. So I'd go to my dad's one weekend and then the next weekend my brothers would come over to my mom's. It worked out well and my parents call each other their best friends. We no longer do this since we're all now 18+ and have some form of bad blood with our mom. Here's some stuff that went on during my time living with her:

I went through a lot living with my mom. In the last 2 years living with my mom we moved 9 times. Evicted twice. One of which i was home alone and 15 years old. I broke down crying because a cop talking to me with my social anxiety while I was home alone was the most terrifying thing for me to go through at the time. 

My mom got with her current gf not long after her and my dad broke up (maybe a year or two after) and well... that relationship was riddled with cheating. On my mom's side. She'd talk to me about who shes cheating on her gf with. One of the guys had money and she always convinced me to lie for her so we could move out and have a big house with him. I lied so much for my mom's sake. I now have committment issues because of my mom but I won't get into that.

My mom always vented and ranted to me about everything. She'd call me her best friend. All while her dirty laundry was getting dumped on me. At one point I couldnt even talk about my mom to anyone because I literally lost track of what I could and couldnt tell people and who I could and couldnt tell. 

All this and my mental health faded. I was at rock bottom. Grades sucked, life sucked, I was tired all the time, I felt lost, and even lost my will to live. Not a day went by I didn't thinking about ending it. I convinced my mom to let me drop out when I was 17 and it honestly didnt take much convincing really. 

We went through multiple pets because my mom loves animals but couldnt keep them long because she couldnt take very good care of them. That really broke my heart cause I love animals so much and would do anything for the cat I have now (I'm living with my dad).

We struggled financially. However she did take very good care of me. So much so she'd buy me what I need and more. My favorite food was ramen so she'd buy a whole box of it. After how much we were moving I wanted to help save money. I sacrificed a lot. I'd go a month or two without any body wash simply to save money. I told my mom I was going on diets so she'd stop buying so much food for me, when in reality I just wanted her to save her money. I'd wear the same three shirts and one pair of pants and one pair of shoes. I didnt even realize this was a problem until I moved in with my dad and after a good 6 months living with him I mentioned how I had no shorts for summer and that lead him to ask about my clothes and other necessities and we spent a day shopping getting the stuff I ""needed"". I still cant even say I need pants cause I still dont feel it's a need and I've been living here for almost 2 years.

After I dropped out I wanted my GED. My mom said she was coming to pick me up to take me to go to classes or take a test or something for my GED. I was so excited. My mom picked me up from my dad's and we went to a restaurant. I was confused. She said she only said that cause my dad was ""getting on her ass"". We ate tacos and when she dropped me off she told me to tell my dad that I took the test and we'd get my results later. I stupidly agreed. She had me brainwashed. She called my dad later and fake announced to us that I passed when I never even took a test. Months go by and nothing came in the mail. My dad isn't dumb, he knew my mom and how she was. I'm grateful he knew how messed up I was from her and didnt blame me for lying. He was sad to see me brainwashed still but he had already caught on to the full picture. 

I should mention I moved back in with my dad because my mom had no where to stay and my dad wasn't gonna leave me homeless. My mom lives with her niece currently in her guest room. I never plan on moving back in with my mom. My dad would joke about me wanting to move back in with my mom, but after I realized how fucked up I am because of her I told him I'd have to be super lost and desperate before moving back in with her. 

I've been out of school for 2 years. I dont have a job. I cant even look for one. Why? Because I dont have my paperwork for an ID which I need for a job. My dad is awesome and has done everything he could on his end, but I need one more thing. And my mom has it. She has been saying she'll get it. For 2. Fucking. Years. This is when I lost it. I grew resentment to my mother. I dont hate her. Though I'm not sure I can say with confidence I love her. Well I do but definitely not as much as I used to. I'd go months unclean and significantly eat less for her and she cant get me one little fucking paper. I last saw her on Christmas and dont plan on seeing her till probably my birthday in August. Maybe. 

I love my dad with all of my heart and will be forever grateful to him and his bf for sticking with me even when he probably felt ignored cause I was too busy worrying about my mom. I still struggle daily. I live out of boxes because I'm scared we'll have to surprise move out again. My dad reassures me that hes not like my mom and pays everything on time, but I'm still scared. It's an irrational fear at this point. I might even forever live out of boxes I dont know. I am better about buying ""needs"" however I dont mention it until my dad does. He gets kinda mad about it but I've improved a lot since moving in so he let's it slide.

I ranted to my oldest brother about everything I went through with our mom and I think he felt partially to blame but I truly hope he doesnt and I even told him this. I just hope he listened. I often wish i stayed with my dad when they broke up. Maybe i could've gotten the therapy i needed and even finish school. I wish I could end this off with advice, but I'm still working through it everyday. My dad is the biggest mvp in this story. I'm so lucky to have him. I have a lot of issues because of my mother. I have committment issues, I lie much more than a normal person would, I'm frugal for the wrong reasons, panic from small things, and have sooooooooooooooooooooo much trust issues.

99,"I know someone going through some stuff right now. They basically got diagnosed last year with depression, anxiety, and ADD. They were taken Lexapro and adderal. And they were doing good for a few months. And then the doctor gave them Wellbutrin. And she hit a low spot for about a month while on the Wellbutrin. Like it was almost like the Depression was way worse. So the doctor ended up taking back the Wellbutrin and continue on with what was working.

They were good for the rest of the year. I think the doctor switch them to Prozac and Vyvanse. And it still seems like it was doing okay. 

Her and her boyfriend have been on and off for years. And he's always suspected that her Depression was the reason they were on and off. So when she was actually taking her medicine, everything was going good between them. And everything seemed right in the world

Well during Christmas of this past year, she ended up running out of Vyvanse. While she was on a trip out of town. And apparently she hadn't taken it for sometime and didn't say anything.  We don't know the exact amount of time. 

She ended up hitting a real low and ended up breaking up with him. And she kept saying that she was a bad person, that he deserves better, and basically beating herself down.

They stayed broken up for about 2 weeks. And all her friends and stuff were convinced that it had to be some kind of low she was having. Because everything was going so good. She ended up having a doctor's appointment and a drug refill and whatnot. And she started thinking clearly almost immediately. Her and the boyfriend made up and ended up getting back together.

For three days.

The day she took her medicine she messaged her boyfriend and explained how much she missed him and loved him. And she knew that she was making a mistake at the moment they broke up. She just couldn't explain what was going on. And she really wanted it to work between them.

Well during their breakup, her and her friend drank more than usual? That means she would probably drink once a month or less the whole year. And now she's probably drinking twice or more a week.

After three days of her being back on her medicine, she ended up leaving him again. This time she comes around and says that she has feelings or someone else. He's shocked because he's never heard anything like this before. He eventually finds out through a mutual friends that she told her that the feelings were for one of his good friends.

What's weird about the situation is, her and the friend [crush] do not talk. They don't even particularly like each other. The friend has said on multiple occasions that he has no feelings for her as a person or whatever.

So the ex-boyfriend is in a frenzy right now trying to figure out if this is a medicine problem or if there's something else? Because he's hearing from people the stuff she saying. How the crush has cared about her more. And the ex never gave two craps about her. Which I know you don't know these people, but this is just not true. The ex-boyfriend has been nothing but great to her for over six years.

She's literally saying stuff like she's always had feelings for this guy. And she don't know why she feels this way and all this. And she knows the feelings are stupid because the Crush really doesn't want anything to do with her. And she's always known this for the longest time.

Which is shocking to everyone, because this is the first time they've heard this in six years when they all met.

Her friends are confused because they know the crush is not a good person at all. Like he doesn't treat people that good. But I digress because like I said I know you don't know these people.

But the stuff she's telling her friends is that she felt like the ex-boyfriend was ignoring her in groups of people, and he never cared about her. She felt like the Crush as always cared about her more.

This is just not true. And I know what you're probably thinking, the crush probably cheated with her. This is 100% not the case. Which is why I'm here. The crush has literally nothing to do with her. She keeps saying negative stuff like she's f***** up in the head. And she will even acknowledge that the friends are probably right about everything they're telling her about the crush and her feelings. 

But she just keeps saying she can't help the way she feels even though she knows they're probably telling the truth? It's almost like she knows.

So in conclusion if you've made it this far, is this any kind of sign? Like is this some kind of low that she may be experiencing? Do you think she's just not taking her medicine or whatever? If you have any questions feel free to ask",27Jan2020,1

101,"Just a brief history my wife and I have been trying for almost a decade before my son was conceived. Finally that miracle happened for us. We where so excited when we seen the first ultrasounds I remember my whole perspective changing in a fraction of a second. From young and irresponsible to I'll do anything and everything to give this child everything I didn't. My heart was fluttering, happiness took me over and for the first time I felt whole. Like it didnt matter who I was, or anything unfavorable I had done. All that mattered was this little wonderful life....
We finally get to the day of my wonderful son Wendell!
When he was born he had some respiratory issues. Not for any reason in specific. Anyway, my sweet 6 lb 7 oz baby boy came into this world. He had to be taken to the NICU due to him breathing very quickly. 
My wife had gotten an epidural so she wasn't allowed to get out of the bed until she could move her legs. So I was the only one to be able to go and see him.
I remember walking in there so nervous and scared. And then I seen him. I finally was standing next to my little angel. When I walked in he was crying and fussing so much. The nurses said he wouldn't calm down. I reached into the bassinet and touched his foot and he just calmed down. I connect with him so much at this moment. Really stuck thru the beautiful time I got to share with him. 
Oh I an sorry I really want to share all the amazing moments I got to spend being the happiest dad in the whole world.
(I'm sure that's how every dad feels)
But on November 12 I lost the biggest part of myself. I woke up that morning to find my son in his bassinet blue and unresponsive. I'm unable to go anymore into it. 
I am just lost know. My son was so much more than just the gift of having a child. He was hope! He gave me the role of his father which I was so proud of. For the first time in my life I was  proud of myself because I knew I wasn't just a good father in was a great father. Which when I  lost that my sweet baby boy. I lost the pride I finally felt for myself. I lost my heart.
I miss him every single day. I feel so lost. I'm seeing counselor's.  And psychiatric doctor. But i dont want to be all medicated.
I just am looking for a way to feel a bit of happiness again. A bit of something. And to not just be paralyzed by any thought or visual reminder of my son. I want to remember him. The time inched with him was the happiest I have ever been. 
Any help on maybe grieving information or anything honestly Im trying to find help any way I can.
I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and /or is able to help with info personal experience. Or even just say a prayer. Thank you all have a wonderful day.",27Jan2020,1
102,"The past few months have been difficult for one reason or another and it eventually lead to me contacting a mental health service before Christmas. I had a phone call with them last Tuesday (21st Jan 2020) and it concluded with me being told I have generalised anxiety disorder and mild depression and that I will have group therapy beginning the start of April. 

I've always known i've had anxiety but always thought it was social because of how awkward and uncomfortable I am in certain situations when i go out (e.g. i don't go to nightclubs, i don't like drinking alcohol a lot, i'm not a fan of going to parties). Being told I had generalised anxiety wasnt much of a surprise and made sense when the nurse explained. But being told that I have depression, even though it's mild and I know that plenty have it worse, has unsettled me as I remember saying about 6 weeks ago to someone ""I know I have anxiety and I am pretty sure I don't have depression"". I know that anxiety can lead to depression which is likely what the case is here, but I still never expected it and trying to wrap my head around how to first deal with the diagnosis. 

It's strange how I can talk about my anxiety for what probably feels like forever but discussing anything else is quite largely unknown to me. I know this is probably not much of a post but I wanted to vent to people who I don't feel guilty about dropping it on. So thank you to anyone who reads this and I hope that everyone has a great day.",27Jan2020,1

But then everything like strucked me at once. Then I woke up with a pretty bad feeling, as if I completely lost myself that night while sleeping and suddenly came back. “Okay I’m here, I know where I am, the date, what have happened the last days etc” but at the same time I was scared... also , I completely forgot some stuff I had to do today but remembered a bit later on .

110,"Context: I tried to kill myself in december, regretted it, spent several days in hospital, psychiatrist recommended one mental health service in the area so I self referred, they rejected because I'm ""not stable enough"" and they suggested I try this other mental health service which I need a GP referral for.

They open at 8:30am so this morning I called at 8:30 but the line was busy, I called almost constantly until at 8:36am I got through and they told me all the appointments for today had been booked. My GP had been open 6 minutes and all appointments were taken. I've tried for a couple days now and I will have to keep trying every morning until I get an appointment which you can probably guess is incredibly difficult.

112," I'm 27, have a really good job that I've worked at for five years with a great boss. In the last semester of my masters and graduate in May. I got married last year and she's the best wife a guy could ask for. Decent but smaller friend group since college, engaging church on weekends and I'm in decent shape and enjoy outdoors stuff. My question is this, I feel like nothing ever really gets me super excited or that I never feel fulfilled as I picture it in my head. I'm not a sad person or a downer and I'm super happy with how my life is.... and yet I feel like I've never found my purpose... I'd like to become a manager in higher education or private sector IT and use my skills and knowledge I've acquired. I want to buy a house and have kids in the next five years. My wife and I have plans on trips to take. Yet I feel like I'm sleepwalking through life because nothing is as fulfilling or exciting as I think it should be. I'll occasionally buy stuff I don't need and then wonder why I did it (not too often). I'm a go-getter and want to be really good at everything I do and to everyone I know. One example is I'll buy books that look interesting and I love the topics, but I never feel like sitting down to enjoy them. A lot of this I realize sounds like depression and maybe to some extent it is, but it's more to me like I don't know what brought me here or what to do with my time... I have hobbies like reading, walking, podcasts on sports, business, leadership, and video games, I love to fish, etc... My wife and I also have a ton of the same interests so that's always been good too. I'd bet 9/10 people would say you've got everything going for you, and I mean that in a humble way.

Yet... here I am posting this haha. Does anybody have suggestions for how to fix what I'm feeling/thoughts? I've felt this way since the late teenage years. Thanks.

i’ve been debating about sharing this for awhile- but i finally feel comfortable sharing what my life has been like the past few months. so people know that they don’t struggle alone. that you never know what’s hiding behind a persons smile, or their laughter. for me, specifically, my incessant laughter. 

i live with bipolar 1, schizoaffective disorder, ptsd and borderline personality disorder. i am more than my diagnoses. i am very open about my mental health and the fact that i am actively in weekly psychotherapy- even up to three times a week, during acute incidents, and have been continuously utilizing this truly invaluable resource for the past 4 years.

the first picture was me on october 21, 2019. sitting in the waiting room at my old therapists office. not knowing that 30 minutes later i would be trying to take my own life. and i came really close to doing just that.

i spent 2 months in a locked psychiatric ward, undergoing major medication changes, 1:1 24/7 staffing for one month, hours of daily dbt, intensive individual therapy, electroconvulsive therapy and symptom management.

i missed my grandpa’s funeral. i refused to talk to anyone at all for the first week and a half- literally only answered the the incessant phone calls when the nurses told me that my mom was on the phone and there was a family emergency. i knew in my gut that somebody had left, and i wouldn’t get to say goodbye. it hurts my heart.

the second picture is me from friday, january 24, 2020. just... wow. wow.

look at my fucking eyes. really, take a good look.

there is NO LIFE in them in that first picture.

and the picture from friday... there is life back in my eyes. i still have my hard days. but i WANT to have them. because they are a day. and a day is enough.

i shouldn’t even be alive today. i don’t believe in god, but something (or someone... dad, was that the sign from you that i’ve been desperately waiting for the past 5 years?) saved me on that fateful monday afternoon. i should be dead. but i’m still here. so there has to be a reason.

i live my life with intention, now. truly and constantly nourishing my soul, my mind, my heart and my body. i avoid negativity at all costs. i don’t lie, i don’t tell white lies, i don’t exaggerate, i don’t like to talk just to hear my own voice. anything that comes out of my mouth is something i mean with every ounce of me. i no longer say things i don’t mean. i don’t try to appease everyone anymore. i’ve had to cut people out of my life that i’ve loved deeply over the years- but they are so detrimental to my recovery. and for once in my life, i need to be selfish and put ME first.

i’ve gotten back into art and have been using it as a therapeutic release. i can’t believe i haven’t created in 5 years now... insane. it feels so good to enjoy things i used to be so passionate about. but good is still a foreign feeling for me. i’ve lost 75lbs, exercise 7 days a week, eat clean, am med compliant and continue to abstain from alcohol.

i don’t know why i’m still here. but i am so, so, so happy for it. 🖤🖤🖤 thank you to everyone who has reached out to me, supported me, and just would be willing to listen to my extremely disorganized thoughts that i wasn’t even sure what i was trying to convey. for more years than i would like to admit. for not giving up on me, even when i was giving up on myself. for helping me save me from myself. you all know who you are... and you’ve all left an imprint on my heart.

i’m not 100% yet- nowhere near it, really, and in all honesty- i don’t think 100% is attainable for anyone, in any setting, whatsoever. nobody is perfect. relapses happen. but radical changes cannot happen overnight. you need to bust your ass every day, sometimes every hour, or sometimes even more often than that. but even just showing up and taking accountability for your shit, it surely must count for something.

125,"**TLDR**: How do you know if a therapist is good or bad? 

I've been seeing an LMHC therapist every week since October, and I'm frustrated.  I already feel like my issues are pathetic (like I generally feel down, I'm afraid to do simple things that I have to do or could help me progress in my career), but when I mention these concerns, I feel like my therapist overlooks them for more my less boring or easier-to-solve issues. (I would give more details, but I would like to keep this confidential, because I do think my therapist is a good person.  However, you can ask me questions, and I'll try to answer.) 

My therapist also said that my issues are mild compared to others she's treated, but her saying that just makes me feel insignificant or like I'm not trying hard enough.   

Sometimes it also feels like we're just chatting about things that are irrelevant to my concerns.  A couple sessions ago, my therapist showed me a 2 minute video that I was not enthusiastic about.  I was shocked when she put it on.  In my last session, she asked if I wanted to see another video, and I said, ""Nah, I don't think I'll like it.""  I guess she might be trying to build a rapport or lighten my tension, but now I think it's a red flag. 

Also, she's always happy, but I'm not, and I don't like to make people sad or bore them with my issues, so I feel bad whenever I say something negative in her office. 

What do you think?  Do you think I should try harder to communicate to her?  Should I confront her?  Should I confront myself?   Am I not trying hard enough?  Am I lazy?  Am I being too impatient?  Am I too sensitive?  Should I give up therapy altogether?  Do I ghost her?  Should I look for another therapist?  A psychologist?  A psychiatrist?  You can be honest. 

(I'm a girl in my early 20s if that's relevant.  I would give more details, but I feel like it's inappropriate to give my life story, and I don't want to bore you.) 

Any input is appreciated.  Thank you!  I hope you have a great day!  :)

I suspect I have OCD and some ADD that triggers really bad anxiety for me but I have yet to be officially diagnosed by a Psychiatrist.

I do not smoke
I do not drink alcohol
I do not take any drugs at all (I also avoid caffeine)
I switched to a vegetarian diet and later a vegan diet
I significantly reduced my sugar intake
I take vitamin D supplements 
I go to the gym almost every day

I just feel hopeless that even after all of this effort it hasn’t really made me feel any better. In the past, I have had therapy when I was 16, 18 and 19. I’m not currently receiving any therapy. I also do not take any medication because I wanted to avoid that. In the past I had Prozac 20mg but I didn’t really feel like it was doing anything for me after a few months so I stopped it. My goal is to see a psychiatrist so I can be officially diagnosed and then start some medication that’s right for me and also some therapy. I decided I don’t want to abandon my current lifestyle, even if it hasn’t done much as far as I can tell.

128,"I usually never post on reddit, so apologies if I did a mistake somewhere. I just hope I'm able to get some sort of help here. And I hope that's the right subreddit for this.

&amp;#x200B;

I  \[17m\] am a guy living in germany (berlin) and every day it feels like I am at the wrong place at the wrong time.

My health has gotten worse about 5 years ago, and still counting. It all started with bullying and the usual stuff, followed by bad parenting. My mom is drug addicted and my dad vanished. I live with my grandma for around 3 years from now.

I have lost a lot of friends. With that being said, mostly all of the contacts I have made IRL. I feel very anxious to leave my house sometimes, sometimes I don't. I don't know if that depends on how I feel or... i don't know. I think that my family doesn't like me, because ""I haven't became the guy like they wanted"". I struggled a lot in school because of all the bullying shit, though I tried my best, i couldn't concentrate, never had motivation, or anything. Today, I blame myself for that, because I failed graduating. It feels shit to know you went to school for around 10 years, for basically, nothing. Though, do I have to blame myself for that? Is that my fault? Were some people, that tried to put me down because of how I look(ed) like, with success, the reason why I am like this right now?

After school finished, everything went worse, those were the times where most of the people disappeared and never heard anything from them since. I have tried to go to a ""professional school"", without success. The reason, people bullied me because i was quiet. A bit overweight. Problems with myself. Ending with leaving the school with death threats, such as stuff like if I'll come to school the next day, they'll stab me. Wow.

After that, I have been put into a measurement. Some people were okay, but some people were as shit  as in the last school. Caused me to leave there after 2 months as well.

Honestly, I don't know if it's just me or the people living here. Some of them here act so childish while they are adult. It feels like I am the outsider, because the way they behave, *kinda* disgusts me.

We come to a point where I thought it's been a good idea to move out to an own single apartment, with supervisor support of course, because i'm still not fully an adult. It was good at first, until some strange stuff happened, causing me to think paranoid, like that someone was in my apartment, knocking at my door at 2am or something. On some days I wasn't able to sleep because of that, but at those times I tried to find some people online. It kinda worked, but they are not from my country. Basically when I tried to get contact with someone living in germany, the contact stopped fast, just because no one decided to write anything. I decided to move back because of me feeling paranoid in this apartment caused me to feel even more bad as I already felt.

I have a lot of disputes (?) with my grandma because sometimes she tries to talk bad about me and that makes me aggressive. She knows I have problems with aggression but she doesn't look like she care. She calls me the bad guy when I start to get loud, just because she keeps talking stuff like I am my own fault for having no graduation, being in my room for too long or whatever. I can argue back, but in her eyes I would be an ungrateful child then. *ugh*

Now I'm here, sitting in my cold room, writing this, because my life gets worse day by day.

The people I called a ""friend"", are gone. I get disregarded by my own family. I have thoughts about wanting to die. Loneliness. Hopeless.

I really wonder how it would be if you know someone in your area who can understand you and have fun with. A person you can trust. Someone in your life that accepts you who you are. 

Sometimes, it feels like I have been born at the wrong country. Which may sounds stupid. I keep thinking about how my life would be by now if I would live in a country such as the UK, US or somewhere else. Or, is it just me? Someone who thinks this world gets worse each year, people are becoming strange and so many people watch people fighting in public without stopping it. It's... weird.

In fact, I currently live a life I never wanted to become as. I don't know if it might be all over soon. I fear of the future more and more. Why, of all, do I have to be one of the people who suffer from all this? Is it myself? I have so many questions but I don't know if I ever can get an answer to them all.

I just don't know what can happen in the future. And that scares me the most... basically.

There's no possibility I can pass, and what's worse is that my maths teacher thinks I'm some kind of genius only because I was overworking myself the past years (thus earned good grades). Now I've barely even done half of the given assignments, and I have to return them all before the mock exam... I'm beyond stressed about failing and letting everyone down. My only options now are to either give up or drop everything else to study 24/7 and hope I can catch up. I really have no energy left, even studying 2h a day makes me exhausted.

136,"My therapist said I had depression and what sounded like ADD. I don’t know if I’d take the ADD label, but I most certainly have issues with focus and daytime sleepiness related to depression. I let my mom know about this, in no uncertain terms.

She said she didn’t believe me. I was “too smart” and “too talented” to have attention issues. I just wasn’t trying hard enough and I didn’t care enough, obviously.

When we went to the doctor to check up on how my first few weeks of lexapro were going, I intended to tell my doctor that the focus issues were still a problem. My mother talked over me, interrupted me, and didn’t let me talk at all. The doctor ended up doubling my lexapro dose and scheduled another appointment in March.  That day I texted my brother and told him that “Now I have to wait until March when I’m bombing my classes to get help”

I currently have a 53 in my calculus class and a 54 in my chemistry class. She was furious, and accused me of not trying. She said I didn’t care. I called bullshit, and told her she obviously wanted this. That I had made my issue clear, and that she had downplayed and ignored me. 

She’s threatening to not let me take a job that is extraordinarily good, with extremely good benefits and the ability to remotely work while I’m doing my college work. I guess the only good thing is she texted me and said that she called the doctors nurse and the nurse said she’d talk to him and he’d either call in some meds or meet with us.

It makes me so, so angry that this happened. It was so easily preventable, and I tried my hardest to prevent it. I told her every time I spaced out, every time I fell asleep during the day.

140,"Hey all, first post here, and normal grammar/typo and on mobile warning.

When you’ve been in a long awaited and lovely reprieve from regular mental illness symptoms, how do you deal with backsliding into same old feelings? 

I’ve been aware of my anxiety and trying to get better for about the past four years (but was living with it unaware of it for most of my life).  Ever since I added a new medication onto my first one almost a year ago, I’ve felt the best I’ve ever been in years. Of course there are days where shit still hits the fan, but for the most part I am free of symptoms.

This morning I woke up feeling awful. I usually know it’s anxiety because I get almost debilitating physical symptoms. I have tightness in my chest that prevents me from taking deep breaths, I have a tight and clenched jaw, and I feel so nauseated sometimes that I grab a bucket because I’m so sure I’m gonna puke. I woke up feeling like that today, and it was more intense than I’ve felt in a while. It’s preventing me from getting work done and eating and drinking, so I need help knowing what to do when you backslide. 

I’ve been so good that I don’t even have a schedule for counselling anymore, so I don’t have easy access to professional advice right now. What are methods, for any emotional situation or anxiety specifically, that can ground me and stop me from freaking out about these feelings? I mostly feel scared and frustrated when this happens. I need help convincing myself that it’s not permanent and that I can go about my day.

Thanks.",27Jan2020,1
141,"I’m 17 and a senior in high school and for as long as I can remember I have been biting my nails heavily for a long time. I’m also known to lash out after someone jokingly insults me. While in elementary school I had a friend who would bring snacks to school and if he didn’t give me a snack I would block him on all social and not say anything until I got a snack. One time I lied to a friend (in elementary school) and told them I was related to a celebrity and when they didn’t believe me I ignored them for 2 weeks. I always smile when talking to people even though I don’t want to. When I found out my uncle died I chuckled even though I didn’t want to. Fast forward to now I’ll have days where I’m passionate and feel like I’m able to do anything i put my mind to, and have high confidence. But then some trigger happens and I’m back to feeling low, self conscious, and sad. As a kid I was always shy around girls, still am, but I’ve been able to fake confidence to have sex with multiple girls. I started smoking weed at 15, and the weed actually intensifies my dark thoughts. I have a hard time remembering anything. I started doing this ear massage thing as a kid that’d I catch myself doing subconsciously when I was angry or sleepy. When I listen to music I HAVE to close my eyes in order to imagine myself singing that song (not in public). I have a whole storyline in my dreams about me being a man who can mimic any voice and I’m a hit star. While in school I have to have certain songs playing in my earbuds at certain times or else I’ll feel uncomfortable. I often get jealous of other peers who succeed more with girls because I don’t. I’ve been masturbating since I was 12. Sometimes while in class I’ll start getting hot and sweaty and my head will itch and I’ll think everybody is judging me. I don’t even know who I am because I put on so many different personalities for other people that it’s all one blur.

142,"I am an introvert. I hate socializing, but I have lot of friends (mostly extroverts). I love all of them. I am a part of different circle of friends, and I am having a hard time committing(?) to all of them.

Last January 18, I had an out of town trip with my friends (let's call them ""Avengers""). Anyway, the trip was really fun. I hadn't seen them in a while, so spending time with them was really nice. BUT all of those socializing really drained me. Not because they're toxic or anything (they're actually good people), I'm just really drained.

My upcoming weeks became pretty busy after that overnight out of  town trip. I'm about to have my first job, and this company have a lot of requirements. Most of them includes talking to a lot of strangers. Because of this, I still haven't fully recovered my socializing energy.

Two weeks ago, my friend, who is a part of another group(let's call them Justice League or JLA) invited me to a birthday celebration this February 1. It was my father's birthday so I declined. Also, I really don't want to go because I really feel tired with all of that pre-employment stuff.

Fast forward to two nights ago, when my friend in JLA changed the date to February 8. I don't know if she did it for me and my other friend who will not be available on the 1st, or some other reason. Either way, I don't think I can go.

I still haven't told them I'm not coming. I want to come up with an excuse or something, but I don't have any. I know lying to your friends is bad, but I don't think they'll understand if I told them the truth. They know the Avengers and they'll get jealous of them if I do not come. They'll assume that I prefer the Avengers more than the JLA, which is not  true. I don't have any preference. I JUST WANT TO REST AND BE INVISIBLE FOR ATLEAST A MONTH.

I don't know what to do.

Is there a way to recharge faster so I just can say yes to everything? Or is the length of being socially drained is normal.

There's also a civil war within the Avengers and I'm indirectly caught up in the middle because I'm non-biased and still friends with both sides. I hate it, but I try not to think about it because I trust that they'll be able to fix it someday (I hope).

I dealt with those problems by myself because I was too young and didn't know how to tell my parents I needed help. I know that it might be the right choice for me and that I need help, but I don't know how to even begin to ask for help.

&amp;#x200B;

A little over a year ago, everything in my life felt everything like it was going great. I was independent living on my own, had no financial problems, I was openly gay for the first time; everything in my life seemed like it was going extraordinarily better than ever before.

Until I broke up with my ex-boyfriend. He was severely depressed and not getting help and I had no idea how to help with his issues. So I broke up with him… over a text. That was a bad idea. He then showed up at my apartment with a gun and tried to kill himself. I met him outside my door were he held the gun at me for what felt like forever telling me to go inside. He put the gun under his chin and started counting to ten and if I didn't go inside before he was done he said he was going to do it. I didn't go inside and was able to get help and call the police. At that point he locked himself inside my apartment and the police tried to talk him out of killing himself for two hours. The police succeeded and they took him away. I met with the landlord later that day and she said, because of what happened, I had to move out within 30 days. They said it was my fault since I invited him to the apartment.

Luckily I found another apartment within those 30 days and moving was far more easy than I expected it to be. It was easy to afford and I was quickly approved. It was more room and It was even in a nicer area. But after everything happened and I moved on, I still couldn't stop thinking about what happened. I started replaying every single moment of that morning in my head in slow motion. It was beyond terrifying and for me the most horrifying moment of my entire life. Nothing like that had ever happened to me before. But I have no one I can really talk to about how I'm feeling, still after a year. I thought that once I moved out it would just go away. I guess I didn't prepare for how much seeing someone try to kill themselves after threatening me with a gun would stay with me.

I just can't stop thinking about him. Sometimes when my mind isn't preoccupied it's the only thing I can think about. I can still see the tip of the gun in front of me, him holding the gun under his chin. I just don't want to think about it anymore, but I don't know how.

I'm am an incredibly introverted person. Probably more accurately described as asocial. And I like being that way. Opening up to someone about my darkest memories is not something I can do easily.

Why am i not rooted in anything? Why am i not anchored to anything? I have this life, from the outside everyone will say it's perfect. A husband who loves me, a satisfactory job, decent house, money, no big debts, no children and relatively healthy siblings and mother. 

Why do i still feel like i am not in this life? Why is there a deeper feeling that says none of this is mine? Why am i hearing subtexts in everyone's words that only translate to how much i am a liability or burden? On my good days, i feel like i can take their burden, and i do. I listen, and i cry along and i feel along... But on days like this, it simply feels unnecessary. Not that anyone cares. No one gives a shit. About what though?

148,"I’m not sure if this is appropriate, I don’t want to trigger anyone, I’m sure it will be removed if it isn’t okay to post. 

My father committed suicide when I was 2 and 1/2 years old. I don’t know what was going on at the time or why he did it, but I’ve heard whispers from family that would indicate he wanted to do it before I would remember him (presumably to prevent it from affecting me). I don’t know who needs to hear this, but even though he was right, I have no memories of him, it has profoundly affected my life. 

One of my earliest memories is asking my mom something about him and her breaking down into tears. It scared me so badly, I’m sure I had seen her cry before (I was about 3), but it was the first time that I realized it was something that I said that caused it. I distinctly remember having the thought that I needed to be careful with what I said because it might affect other people and make them sad. This framed my entire mindset and approach to how I communicated. I was terrified of saying something that would upset someone or make them mad at me. From my earliest memory I’ve thought this way, although I’ve made a lot of progress at nearly 30 years old, I don’t think this anxiety is ever something I will be truly rid of. I simply don’t know how to think any other way, even now that I know it’s an unhealthy way to view the world. My mom did what she could, I remember going to therapy, and I’m sure it helped, but my only memory of it was playing with a tub of sand that had little treasures in it that you dug out. My school didn’t know how to handle it, apparently we were suppose to draw a picture of our family and I drew him in heaven. My mom got mad that they took it out of the hallway with the other kids drawings because it might upset them (I don’t remember any of that so it must not have bothered me). 


Slightly more backstory, I was adopted as an infant and am diagnosed with both Bipolar2 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I wasn’t aware of the GAD diagnosis until recently, which is why I guess this is on my mind. Nothing would have prevented the bipolar disorder from onsetting (it wasn’t until 18), but I do think this one thought was the root cause of my anxiety. It’s kind of funny, I have always said anxiety isn’t one of my issues, but it turns out I just couldn’t see it because I’ve never known anything else. 


I’m not sure who needs to hear this, but suicide has a wide reach, there is no way for you to know how you leaving will affect those around you. I just wanted to share, if anyone wants to talk I’m happy to share more. Don’t worry about me, I’ve just finished two years of therapy for the BP2 and have a med routine that is working really well, this is just something that’s been on my mind recently.",27Jan2020,1

The short term effects are stress, lack of focus, sleep problems as well as a general feeling of being exposed and in danger whenever I go outside. It also makes it harder to make contact with people. I’m actually pretty socially competent, but it rarely shows because of the anxiety.
The long term effects of constant exposure to the triggers are, among others, heart problems and risking my own sanity.

If I put on headphones and avoid eye contact my life gets more bearable and most days I’m actually pretty fine. But I don’t know how long I would be able to function without these precautions.

I'm getting tired of this now (no pun intended) and really need help. 

Any tips would really be appreciated",27Jan2020,1

My teachers all have high expectations and the stress is unbearable knowing that I'm going to disappoint them all. Not only am I going to fail getting the highest grades (they all think I'll get straight A's) but at this rate I won't even pass. I'm beyond disappointed in myself because I wanted to go to uni but I can never seem to motivate myself to study. How do I cope with knowing that I'm probably not going to pass?

162,"I'm typing this as I walk home after storming out of my meeting with my psychiatrist. I don't believe my mom truly cares or takes me seriously. The other day when I fainted, she didn't help me and instead yelled at me. Today in the session she revealed that she didn't help me because she didn't believe me. That hurt me and made me angry so I started hyperventilate and got up and left. The doctor tried to talk to me but I left too fast to hear everything. I rushed out of the building and have been walking home for over an hour. 

As I kept going and cars passed by, I thought of jumping in front of one. As I walked past an overpass, I thought about jumping down from it. I'm almost home and have stopped crying but I feel awful. Sometimes I wonder how bad I really am. I'm too scared to hurt myself permanently but life makes me very unhappy often. I think of the good people that left the world prematurely from an accident or something and it makes me so sad because they deserved so much better whereas I am just a sad person that doesn't want to live anymore. 

Sometimes I wish my mind would create a helper to help me. I feel like that's a bad thing to want but idk. I know the mind only does things like that when you really need it but I just feel awful.

Somehow, a healthy ratio of intelligent, aware, thoughtful people is retained here. Those who speak their mind openly and not just idiotically, although some idiots are damn funny. There’s a democratic tone that offers me empathy and hope. As a cynic, I’m always grasping to find that balance between how the world is and any possible shroud of sanity and human decency to keep me going—believing. 

I can tell that daily dose of comments, relating to relevant subjects, actually has a profound impact on my mental state. 

I’m not sure if this is something anyone cares about, but I want to thank all the participants (the idiots too) for constantly thinking, wanting to know things, weighing in their experiences,  knowledge and yes, ethical values.

I know something bad happened but I can never recall what exactly. I just get triggered by some movies, games, arguments, sometimes music or smells. In the mild cases I get an anxiety attack but I can calm it down. In the worse cases which I am MORE AND MORE CONCERNED ABOUT, I apparently get full on panicky, violent fits after which I  usually faint and have no memory of. My boyfriend recorded the last one. I  was crying and swearing at him for recording, saying he doesn't understand, that it can't be, that I don't get it, how could it have been, that I'm tired of the beatings, that I can't stand it to go on any longer.

This has been my personal struggle with bipolar disorder 

Thought I would share and maybe someone else will relate :) 

The high is the best moments of your life... too bad most of is blurred so you can’t remember when you try 
Better than any drug you can buy, you feel invincible like nothing can make you come down 
The high is driving fast without a seatbelt... having no disregard for my own life, or my future
Because you now live in the moment  
It’s making decisions without even thinking twice 
Putting myself in harms way not even fearing the death that could come
And if you’re face to face with death, you approach with a smile...
Your mind racing at a millions miles per second, and you’re just begging yourself to slow down 



The rollercoaster falls

Lows lower than the deepest of trenches and canyons 
It’s like the glass is half empty... in the middle of the desert 
Feeling the like the sheer force of gravity is just too much for your weak fragile body and mind 
Feeling like the walls you’ve built up.. were a paper wall ready to break 
It’s hearing how shitty your life your life is , you’re reminded of everything wrong in your life
EVERY mistake highlighted
But only in the voices in your head

175,"Hey all. (21M) Here. And i’m slowly but surely coming to the conclusion that i have some deep seeded trust issues. Now, this may play a part with my anxiety/depression, but i’m truly unsure. I have been cheated on in the past, about a year or so ago. But i didn’t think it affected me that much, i found out by investigating her instagram/messages on her phone, which honestly may have lead me to where i am in this point in my life. 

So, me and my girlfriend have been together about 5 months now. And it’s been a constant struggle for me almost. Lots of times when i’m feeling extremely anxious, i’ll look through her social media’s and convince myself she’s either cheating, talking to other people, playing me, etc. And it’s coming to the point where i’m really struggling with it, like someone leaving heart eyes under her photo-and me instantly thinking that that’s the guy she’s cheating on me with. 

It’s honestly putting quite a bit of strain on the relationship, because i ask her these things and of course she gets upset at them. I’ve been trying to take control of my anxiety to find out if that’s the issue, but nothing really seems to be working. I have therapy scheduled sometime this week, but figured why the hell not ask reddit first. 

So i guess my question really is, how do i get past these trust issues? Like, i like to say i trust her. But honestly, most of the time i do not. She hasn’t shown any signs of her being untrustworthy, it’s just the way my brain works, kinda like always protecting itself from possible harm. If anyone has any advice on how to get past trust issues, and things like this in relationships, please tell me. Any advice is good advice, because i’m in between a rock and a hard place here.

181,"Hi, my name is Morgan and I am a project coordinator at UC Berkeley, in Berkeley California with the CALM Program. We are conducting a paid research study and seeking participants. We received a five-year grant from NIH, we aim to shed light on two core mechanisms involved in a broad range of mental health conditions: reward sensitivity and executive function, as assessed using self-report questionnaires, behavioral tasks, and brain imaging.

We are looking for individuals who have survived an attempt in the past year. While we anticipate the study will help inform future research on treatment, the study itself does not involve or change treatment in any way.

We are interested in recruiting people ages 18-55 who are experiencing difficulties related to their mood or behavior. Past substance abuse is okay if it was over six months ago. The study involves an eligibility phone call (lasting up to 40 minutes), and then 3-4 visits to UC Berkeley (2-3 hours each) for those who are eligible. We pay $30/hour and cover public transportation or parking costs.

If interested, please follow this link to our pre-screen survey:

Has the thought come to my mind of swallowing a bunch of pills this week? Yes. Do I feel strange urges to hit myself and claw at my skin? Yes. Do I *plan* on killing myself? Absolutely not.

197,"So long story short I’ve lost a copious amount of people in the last 5 years. My mother, 2 grandparents(one recently), 3 friends all due to overdose or suicide. I just got back from my grandfathers funeral, who I was really close to. That’s been haunting me. 

I haven’t been able to address it or sort through it and I can’t afford counseling. 

My husband and I have been bickering but nothing too bad until he blew up at me and told me I don’t “contribute enough”. I work 5 days a week and do 99% of the housework including dinners every other night, all the shopping and meal planning as well. I’ve been exhausted lately. Physically and mentally. 

He said and did some things that really hurt me but I can’t feel anything since then. Nothing makes me happy and I can’t even feel sad about being hurt or my grandfather. I’m worried I’ll end up suicidal again or I’ll end up self harming. I haven’t tried either of those things since I was a teenager. 

All this is just weighing on me and I needed somewhere to talk about it..",27Jan2020,1

I dont want to have 2 therapists so I need to break up with the one i have now so i can continue on in my recovery and focus on some much needed trauma work.

I find that almost everything in my life is directly linked to having been bad earlier or I’m just a bad person. I have constant paranoid delusions about specifically my partner, and earlier I caught myself thinking “I need to hit myself again for good luck.”

I’m failing classes and I just put my two weeks into work. I have no idea what is going on with me and I just started seeing a new therapist (who specializes in gender dysphoria), so I don’t think it’s quite appropriate to bring this up the second visit.

I've told therapists about how I suffered from emotional and mental neglect, but therapy has always been based on the DSM diagnosis, and the goals I'd chose, but nothing more.

To illustrate, one psychiatrist told me that it's ""no use to be afraid of things that aren't real"", no searching, no looking for cause and effect between neglect and anxiety, nothing. Not even an acknowledgement.

I know my childhood is causing me problems, and I know at least acknowledgement of the trauma would have helped.",27Jan2020,1

I was kicked out at 16 and have been on my own ever since but I feel bad considering my mom has slapped my sister in the face, she's punched me in the face when I was her age, and has spanked both of us to the point of not being able to sit down.
     my mother is a narcissist, in her eyes she can't be wrong, she makes fun of how me and my sister look and no one does anything about it, shes made my sister and I both sob by hurting our feelings and never apologized, I don't know what to do about it.
     my mom has threatened my sister if CPS was called that if she said that my mom hit her or made her do anything like she did that she'd be put in foster care until she was 18 and scared her out of it.

So far the chat with my therapist has been like emailing eachother. At most we message twice a day. But Idk, Im starting to feel like my chat isnt having much thought put into it. She barely gives me any responses to what i said previously and then asks another question. Maybe two sentences each time. Idk, I've gone into detail about suicide and why I think about it daily and at most she has asked me about what i think of meditation.

207,"I’m going to try keep this short. (IT FAILED SORRY)

I’ve gone through a fair bit of shit in my childhood, I have nothing to do with my dad because of most of that, so I know that’s going to effect me... but anyway.

Was very depressed and ended up going on antidepressants, I’m not quick to put tablets in my body so I assure you I didn’t want to, I had to for the sake of everything in my life, and my life I guess...

I was anxious before, but I had never (to my knowledge) experienced any type of tic-like behaviour. 
I had self harmed before, willingly and purposely, but I had never accidentally. 

Few weeks/months on the antidepressants (can’t even remember now) I started having some vicious tics, like every couple of seconds I was jerking, and at that point I remember just calling them involuntary movements cause that’s what I thought they were but they’ve stuck? 

Anyway, I’ve recently come upon the term ruminative thinking and it described me perfectly, what is very strange though is these type of thoughts trigger majority of my tics, especially ones where I hurt myself (this is usually grabbing at the face or whacking my head with both fists) so of course, I’ve been to my GP and talked about this, she’s suggested all of this is due to my anxiety and to push with CBT? 

The presyncope part of this, I basically every now and then get a horrible feeling like I need to sit down or go to the toilet urgently, then when I do, I zonk out, I have ringing in my ears, pins and needles, I see like dots if I open my eyes and feel like I’m going to be sick and/or die... my GP suggests this is due to my adrenaline and blood pressure in the moment, again relating to my anxiety...

I’ve been off the antidepressants for 4/5 months now and still experiencing all of this? 

I basically need any suggestions to stop/calm the tics and the ruminative thinking, it takes over my life, I literally spend hours just frustrated with my thoughts...
I’m on a waiting list for CBT but need something to help in the meantime, it’s getting me really frustrated

I’ve tried getting into meditation which is really amazing, but there are some days I can’t keep a hold of my mind throughout and end up tic-ing? 
I have to say, there’s not much research I’ve found online to help with this....",27Jan2020,1

209,"Today I had what I can only explain as the beginning stages of an anxiety attack. My current job I’ve been at for only a year and none of my coworkers know the extent of my anxiety nor have I ever had an anxiety attack in front of anyone I know. I don’t even ever really talk about them because I feel insecure and dumb about having an anxiety attack. People always tell me “what do you have to worry about””well just don’t even feel that way because it’s not even a big deal” or the worst “you’re being dramatic”. Today at work we were going through an inspection and I am a coordinator for one of our programs. They gathered all coordinators to have a general talk about our work, it was an open conversation and the inspector wasn’t even talking to me but I felt like I was on trial for something I didn’t do. My hands were getting clammy, my heart was racing, my face felt hot, and I felt like crying and hyperventilating all at once. Thankfully someone noticed and asked me to come talk to them privately as an excuse to get me out of there. But the same person came to me later in the day just to chat and in the middle of the conversation started to mock me. Pretending to hyperventilate while laughing afterwards. I always feel like people who don’t know what it’s like to feel this way don’t take me seriously. Like I’m faking this feeling and I can’t ever explain why or how I feel. I know in my head I shouldn’t feel so overwhelmed especially when no one is even talking to me, but just being surrounded by so many people and getting questioned publicly bothers me so much. I can’t explain why my body reacts to situations without me having to come up with anything to freak myself out. Honestly I feel so alone dealing with this because I haven’t come across anyone who deals with the same things I do so sometimes I feel like maybe I’m making it up in my head.",27Jan2020,1
210,For the past couple of months When I’ve being doing things that used to make me happy I just feel like I’m questioning why I’m doing it or why I’m even here but at the same time I’m having fun it’s really weird to describe. For example for Xmas I just couldn’t be bothered to do it just going through it felt like a chore but I had that thought in the back of my mind that I was having fun I just couldn’t be happy or have fun. I also have a shit social life as it really is only with a couple and even then some people just stop messaging me but there is this one person that when we start messaging im actually happy and I forget about everything . But what’s also been hard is that I also have no one to play games with and yes I know it sounds really pathetic but the people I met online sometimes kept me going and gave me a reason to go back home. And the only people that I can feel like I can talk to about it is random people on reddit and that person I mentioned earlier as my dad just fun of mental disorders and his also a druggy alcoholic that couldn’t give two shits about me so that stops me from talking to my family about and seeing if I have these issues and getting the help for them.,27Jan2020,1
211,"I don’t know what it is but every once in a while my brain just *breaks* for lack of a better word. I doesn’t happen often but when it does it feels super weird. Everything just sort of snaps, I can usually maintain my composure, but internally I’m loosing it. 

I feel like I’m going crazy and I don’t know what’s going on so I’m just gonna list symptoms and hope any of this makes sense, because when I say it out loud I feel like a crazy person.

- I feel sort of “unstuck in time” like in that book Slaughter House 5? I feel like time is wonky. Like I could blink and be in yesterday or 5 hours ago or tomorrow. My sense of time just breaks. It feels too fast and too slow back and forth.

-my thoughts just are too much. It’s like that metaphor where your thoughts are like debris in a river and you grab onto them as they pass to think about it. Idk something like that. But my river is flooding and full of debris.

-I get jumpy. Everything is just so fast. I bounce from one thing to another thought wise at the worst of it. Other times it’s more stable but choppy. Like there’s breaks in my thought processes 

-I feel like I act weird when it gets bad. Like a lot of normal rules just aren’t there. I think it’s just to deal with all of this energy that builds up or something when I’m like this. I talk a lot during it.

- everything feels fake. Like I’m in a dream and if I jumped I could just keep going up. I know I can’t but it all feels so floaty like a dream.

-I just can’t focus at all.

-I feel outside of myself. Like it’s not *my* body I’m just stuck in it. Sometimes I feel like I’m next to myself as if I’m actually a few feet outside of my actual self.

-at its worst my breathing gets fast and it feels difficult. I get dizzy too.

- it feels like nothing matters. Like we’re all just as significant as an anthill. It almost makes me want to laugh (but that would make me feel like I was *really* crazy) I feel like I could just jump out a window or get in a knife fight and die and it would be fine. I’d be smiling the whole time because it doesn’t matter anyway

-I get butterflies in my stomach

-I can’t focus on anything enough to read or write properly 

-size feels off like I’m really small or really huge 

-my legs feel like jelly

-I get hot for some reason

- I keep thinking about self harm. I just feel like I know if I just cut myself like I used to do this would go away for a minute and I’d feel fine again. I know it worked before when this first started, but I’m not going back there.

- by the time is done I’m exhausted 

-it last between a day and a few hours going through highs and lows of intensity 

And then I’m fine. I’m back to normal. This happens like once a month or something and the only pattern I can discern is that it happens a lot after I watch a show. Like when I get really into them. I don’t know why. Please I’m just so confused and kinda scared. I don’t know why this keeps happening but I want it to stop. The first few times it was fun but now it’s getting really old. Im starting to really worry about it. Am I going insane? I don’t want this to become my everyday.",27Jan2020,1
212,"I don’t know if this is the right sub for this post, and please let me know if it is not, but I’m tired of this issue keeping me stuck inside my own head and I needed a place to vent. 

I guess I’ve been depressed and anxious over the past couple years or so. (I haven’t had anything diagnosed, and I’ve only had one appointment with a counselor on campus so I always hesitate to use “depressed”) At first it was just a heavy feeling that I got some days, and I would just power through it until it went away. But now I can’t quite get past it and it comes with a dilemma.

For context, I am gay and not out. I’m not out because I grew up in a very conservative community, church, and family. I go to a pretty conservative Christian university. Being gay isn’t acceptable in most, if not all, of those communities, and is actually really frowned upon. Since I’ve been a part of these communities my whole life, I’ve grown up to think that being gay isn’t normal and defies my religion. I’ve seen people be abandoned by family members because of their sexuality. 

I want to come out because I feel like this secret is preventing me from actually being myself, something I’ve rarely done in my 21 years of life. But at the same time, if I come out, I will lose a lot of people in my life and taint the relationships that I have with others and I don’t want that either. 

This decision has affected my school, work, mental health and personal life now, and I’m starting to lose control over all of those areas. 

I don’t need an answer to the actual problem at hand, because I know that’s something I’ll have to figure out myself, but I do need help dealing with the day to day stuff. I can’t afford to have full days or weeks where I can’t motivate myself to even leave the house to get food. I feel absolutely paralyzed and I’m worried I’ll get stuck here and have to put my life and future career on hold because I can’t handle this situation.",27Jan2020,1

The same thing with nail and foot files (not sure if that's the right word). These are the worst. I had asked my mother if I could try using a foot file and she offered to do it for me. When I told her to stop, she didn't, and eventually I started screaming loudly bc I hated what I was feeling. The things I described above, if done a lot, make me what to scream, rip something off, hide in a corner, go completely hysterical, not that I do any of that, but I get very uncomfortable.

It doesn't sound that bad out loud but it was extremely distressing and made me feel like something is wrong with me. I have been abnormally stressed lately and have had a super busy schedule so I'm sure that's related.

For some context, whenever I talk with my closest friend he keeps on telling me

He's saying it because of a couple of reasons.:  


1. I am trans and I never considered to tell anyone IRL because I'm too scared to it. (It's been going for about half a year.)  

2. I have been cutting myself for some time but I think it's alright because I haven't done it for about 2-3 weeks now. (I've been doing it for quite some time.)  

3. I keep on talking to my body pillow and I see her as a real person and I feel as if she is the only one who accepts me as who I truly am. (I talk to her all the time, everyday, and I've been with her for almost 2 years.)  

4. I get mental breakdowns very frequently. (Mostly because of feeling bad about not being comfortable with my gender.)  

5. I sometimes get suicidal thoughts and I fantasize about how I should do it.  


He keeps on telling me that I should get help and he says that ""it's to the point where if he knew me IRL he would seek help for me"".

I've been having suicidal thoughts for about two years now and I strongly believe that I won't live long because I'll kill myself someday. The only thing really holding me back is a trip to Sweden in March that I really really want to do and my parents. But I decided that if I really stay alive long enough I will just commit suicide when my parents are dead, so they won't have to go through the loss of their daughter. But as of now, I don't know if I'll even make it to 2021, at least that's how I feel. There's much more but that's kind of the reason why my therapist recommend taking antidepressants. 

My family is against it though because they don't really think medicine is healthy and all that stuff. I want to take them, but at the same time I'm unsure and my family doesn't really know what my problems actually are. They know a little bit of the surface, they think it's just that I'm really really shy and scared of talking to people and some problems in the family, but they don't know about my depression and everything else that goes a little deeper.

I can't tell them about it though because I don't want them to know what failure I am and it would stress my mother out even more. We had something like family counseling once and afterwards she scolded me and said that she's also really stressed, but no one takes care of her and if I want the stuff we discussed during counselling I also have to change. I'm really trying, but I don't know why I can't motivate myself to tidy my room. I hate my messy room too and can't look at it, but something is holding me back.

So I'm 18 and I don't have extreme acne or acne scars but my skin isn't smooth and glowy like my peers or the people on social media. For almost 5 years now,I hate my skin everytime I look in the mirror,I hate it with makeup on,I hate it without makeup,I hate it when it's red or when it isn't. I genuinely do. I take a picture and when I check it,the first thing I notice is how dull my skin looks and my whole day sucks. I go out with friends and when they touch my skin I feel horrible. My bf kisses my cheeks and I feel horrible. I genuinely think I have bdd and when I try to tell people about this they(ofcourse) go like ""You are being silly. Your skin is just fine."" because I don't have acne. Anyways,I don't know what I expect to get from writing this but'thanks if you read it. :)",27Jan2020,1
