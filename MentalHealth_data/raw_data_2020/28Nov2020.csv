0,I've lost both my nannas and my cat.,28Nov2020,1
1,"i abruptly missed 45 hours of my antipsychotic, i went what's called ''cold turkey'' , however not intentinally, due to being disorganized, i did not look at how many remaining tablets i had, and realised i had none left, had no way to get to the drug store. 

The first major symptom i noticed was hypomania and risky behaviour, i felt so energetic and had a sense of '''confidence'' but underneath i felt so broken. the 2nd major symptom was SLEEPLESSNESS! i went a full night without getting any sleep, i tossed and turned all night, i eventually got up and gamed, i didn't sleep until 8:00 AM and only got a few hours of sleep. the other symptoms were irritability, suicidal ideation, headache.

After taking my dose again as prescribed, it took me almost two days to fully recover from all those symptoms and now i feel completely natrual and normal again. please don't miss a dose",28Nov2020,1
2,"I‚Äôve had PTSD for about 6 years. For some reason I keep feeling like I need to go back to traumatic settings, like re-enlisting to be in combat or being a PMC so I can go fight overseas, or even my current job. I‚Äôve always felt like I‚Äôm one who is supposed to endure hardships and trauma to protect others from it, but I feel like my heart did kind of trapped in a way. I keep wanting to see more violent imagery and death even though that caused my issues that make life hard. I want to be in more life or death situations and it feels like the PTSD is trying to lure me in deeper. Does this make sense?",28Nov2020,1
3,"okay. hi . this is probably the first and last time I‚Äôm ever going to share my personal thoughts regarding my mental health since tomorrow I‚Äôll see this post and delete it because it was impulsive or something. 

for some context. I‚Äôm 16 y/o female from the UK

anyway. so... I can‚Äôt talk to anyone. I feel as though I‚Äôm making this all up in my head for attention or something and I‚Äôm not but my problems feel so minuscule compared to other peoples so I don‚Äôt see the need to say them to anyone. Why would they want to know. 

I‚Äôve thought about some things lately that aren‚Äôt great, I have to admit. this year more than most I‚Äôve sat in my bed and silently cried into my pillow. and I mean. pain. a shit ton. And I don‚Äôt even know why.. like the first time I broke down at like 2am and it was as if all this emotion just came pouring out of me that I had been bottling up. I can‚Äôt remember the last time I was truly happy. and all this new workload from school and being around my family 24/7 hasn‚Äôt been the greatest. I just need someone to talk to. 

Ah. I feel the need to delete all that. so it might be gone in a few hours. 

thanks for reading if you read all of it I guess.",28Nov2020,1
4,"Hey there, I was hoping that any one of you could give me some advice as I‚Äôve just today been diagnosed with mild depression by my doctor. 

Things haven‚Äôt been great lately, obviously, so I decided to finally book a trip to the doctor. I told the doc about my symptoms, which are mainly what I‚Äôd describe as apathy. I don‚Äôt feel sad, I don‚Äôt feel happy, there‚Äôs just nothing. Nothing excites me, things like videogames isn‚Äôt fun to me anymore, I watch a lot of tv-series and such, but I don‚Äôt particularly enjoy it - it‚Äôs just to not feel so bored all the time. I struggle with motivation a lot, university and exams and all that stuff feel meaningless. So I tell the doc all this, and he says I have a mild case of depression. He tells me to work out, go hiking, relax, get a good sleeping rhytm, be more social. Thing is though, I feel like I do most this stuff already; I go hiking twice a week most weeks, I relax a lot, I sleep 8-9 hours every day, I see my friends as often as I can, which honestly is not very often lately due to covid, but still I try to be social. Another thing I should mention is that I‚Äôve felt this way all my teenage and adult life and I‚Äôve done all the things my doctor prescribed too, all my teenage and adult life. 

So, I was wondering if anyone else on here has struggled with the same thing and have some advice for me. I don‚Äôt think this is something that is going to go over by itself, by doing what I feel like I already have been doing basically all my life and I‚Äôm tired of feeling this way / not feeling. I‚Äôve had this under control, somewhat, before, but lately it has started to severly impact my grades. Should I get a new appointment and if so what should I tell the doc? Thanks in advance, any and all replies are very much appreciated.",28Nov2020,1
5,"Recently, as we're coming close to Christmas, people have been talking about what a difficult year 2020 has been. All I hear is '2020 was tough for all of us' and 'we all need to have a great Christmas to cheer us up' and 'we all deserve so much for getting through this year'. I have no issue with these statements and I agree Covid has affected us all in some way, however, I can't shake the yucky feeling I get every time I hear someone say something along the lines of 'we've all had it rough this year'.

Personally, I began to struggle very seriously with my mental health in late 2019, in my nineteenth year, for the very first time in my life.  A few months went by of hell and then Covid hit, and naturally, it did not help. But to be brutally honest: I hate the fact that my experience has been mushed together with this worldwide experience. I feel (selfishly) that NOTHING could be worse than mental illness, and when people talk about how covid has 'disrupted their plans' or 'made their lives a little worse', I feel anger, not empathy. Because in my eyes, dealing with mental illness is the most testing and most difficult thing to go through in the world.

*I suppose what I'm asking is if anyone else ever feels that dealing with mood or anxiety disorders is at the top of their list for negative experiences? And living through a pandemic comes below?*

Early this year, in a group therapy session, I truly realized that 'difficult experiences' are simply experiences, and it's how you feel about them that categorizes anything and everything is good or bad. 

After sharing all of our feelings with the group, an older man chimed in and said:

 **""I don't feel any better after this session because do you know what?  I have no money, my father died, and my country is at war. I have real problems and the problems you all have are in your heads.""**

I sat there and thought to myself, hmm, ok. My life is objectively ideal. I have money, friends, a partner, a loving family, privilege, yet I feel the worst I have ever felt in my life. This is what I mean. Our pain was equal yet our experience was different.

So this post is kind of all over the place but what I'm saying is...to all the people struggling mentally in life, you deserve the most the world can give you. You deserve a nation full of people talking about how difficult life has been for YOU this year simply because your mind is at war, regardless of a pandemic. Pandemic or not, people with mental health difficulties would have battled every day, and for that, `we deserve so much.`",28Nov2020,1

7,"I mean the really dark moments - what and how gives you the strength or encouragement to get to a functioning point again?

I ask because most mental health advice seeks to treat things as a whole (regular exercise might be great advice but doesn‚Äôt help at 2 am) but never really details any coping strategies for in the moment.",28Nov2020,1
8,"It‚Äôs so stupid. Like, logically I know I‚Äôm still loved. There‚Äôs literally no proof I‚Äôm not loved, but here I am, feeling unloved. My boyfriend was super busy all day and I really only saw him when we woke up and at lunch. I dissociated earlier and was late to help him with the animals (we live on a farm) and had him do an extra chore. He didn‚Äôt say much to me after that and just showered and left the house. He did kiss me goodbye and literally said he loves me twice before leaving. But my brain says he doesn‚Äôt love me and he‚Äôs mad at me or at least annoyed and upset. When he shut my door to leave it looked like he shook his head in like a ‚Äúgod just stop‚Äù way at me. 

Again, logically I know it‚Äôs not correct. I know my thinking is wrong, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like this. I want to talk to him about this when he gets home but I also feel like I‚Äôll just throw more stupid shit on him.

10,"I'm on synthroid, wellbutrin, prozac, and an antacid. I got all of them today on time, but it's evening now and I feel how I feel when I miss a dose of something... sort of shaky and twitchy, dissociative, consistent low grade anxiety, racing and intrusive thoughts (I have those on occasion anyway, they're just happening more right now), obsessive thoughts are a little worse too... 

I'm positive I got everything this morning. I'm staying at a guest house right now with my family for vacation, so of course there's anxiety about being in a new place, but I don't think that's it.

11,"Hello r/mentalhealth,  


Recently, I've become afraid to literally be alone, and these are the circumstances in which it usually happens: 1) when I'm alone, tired, and everyone is asleep. In other words, when I feel that no one is aware of me, I become incredibly afraid and stressed.  


What exactly is this? Is there a name for it? Is it reversible or a sign of worse to come?  


Rest assured, I do plan on getting therapy once I can, but I would like some thoughts and advice on what it is until then.",28Nov2020,1
12,"Hey people,

I dont really know how to write this down and my english isnt the best but i give it a shot.

im a 27 years old male that has been suffering from severe mental illness since childhood. I have seen multiple psychiatrists and have been given multiple diagnoses ranging from OCD,GAD,depression,depersonalization to CPTSD and a personality disorder.

Still, I have no clue what I actually have. Well, I know that I suffer from OCD but its called the doubting disorder for a reason. Still, the intensity and variety of symptoms is still unexplainable to me. I think its best to make some key points because otherwise I could write a book. I have to add that i havent suffered any traumas Im aware of, had loving parents and suffered no abuse whatsoever.

Still, as early as age 4 I remembered being somehow anxious in **Kindergarten:**

\-was afraid of ""the big guy"" in Kindergarten and couldnt let go of that worry

\-remember the day when I started to have urges to confess stuff to my mum (age 4)

\-had thoughts like my parents dying, myself dying, got stuck on scenarios like getting smoke poisoning when sitting at the bonfire

\-in the evening I often times felt lonely and somehow depressed (and I really want to emphasize again, my mum always was incredibly loving and nurturing, thought the world of me and wasnt overprotective either; I emphasize that because I have made the experience that psychologist always think there has to be some kind of attachment issue or abuse going on)

\-had increasingly weird tics and rituals

\-was often times stuck in my head in general and began to create a ""parallel"" narrative even at that age where I have to confess stuff and be ""pure"" and stuff like that, really hard to explain

I could go on but basically my Kindergarten time was shaped by, I guess, pediatric OCD, some anxiety and some depression.

When I got to school, everything just got worse. I developed BDD tendencies and was 100% sure my eyes are ugly and deformed. At that time, I had at least a few OCD themes, lots of tics going on, lots of anxiety and some light depression. 

Age 8 I developed chronic depersonalization that persists to this day. I vividly remember the day my perception changed and everything looked distorted and unreal and I got detached from myself. This got worse over the years but never went away.

When I entered high school, I had full-blown OCD, depersonalization and BDD. At that point my natural self esteem was totally destroyed by those illnesses. I wasnt really aware what was going on still but I just knew something is deepy wrong with me, Im the ugliest man on the planet, I have the most disturbing thoughts on the planet and..yeah. 1 year later, age 12 or 13 I found out about OCD and derealization. 

Im thinking about editing this article and make it more longer but it really puts a strain on me. In hindsight, those are just random note but you get the gist. If I listen to my heart, Its probably severe OCD (BDD is on the OCD spectrum), severe anxiety, depression and as a result depersonalization. My depression could be coined as moderately severe. Its not that bad that I cant eat food anymore or take a shower but as bad to not enjoy anything and basically be bedridden.

My real question is: Is it possible that some individuals just have bad genetics in terms of mental health ? That they just develop severe mental illnesses without any real causes? 

Thank you for reading this mumble jumble",28Nov2020,1
13,"So context 

I moved into my own flat in June, first time solo with no flatmates. Its been a struggle of borrowing and paying back and a cycle of it all.

I have bought one present for my best friend, that's about the only thing I can afford and I am feeling genuinely sick that I cant do Christmas presents this year 

I cant decide between buying lovely gifts or groceries and its really ripping my brain, I'm convinced I can stop eating for a month again to buy presents but I know that's counter productive",28Nov2020,1
14,"Besides my fragile mental state I was in, I learned someone who I once considered a friend basically helped turn all my friends against me, telling them that I‚Äôm crazy or psychotic and not to talk to me anymore, even though I‚Äôve been medically cleared by professionals.

15,"So I keep having vivid images of things I am anxious about. It's in the future. I am easily triggered and even if not, I would get the image in my head, the thought pops up, and before I even know it, it would go away and come back later. However, sometimes, I would try to interact with it, just to hold onto it, feel it, and then let it go but it wont stay. It doesn't hurt me physically, it just bothers my mind glooms it, triggers my anxiety to go to spiral of how bad it could and it would just go away and come back later in few minutes. It keeps reminding me of my fears and anxiety. I know that it's just a thought and there nothing that I could do about. I understand that it's out of my control. I think my mind is only trying to keep me reminded of my fears. I want to get over it but it keeps repeating itself.",28Nov2020,1

18,"I‚Äôve got CPTSD and I haven‚Äôt met my relationship as I wanted to. And made myself and the other person happy. What do I do? How do I get through this pain?

I‚Äôm always angry and just want to hit myself most of all into my legs. So that I can feel angry before I break down and mourn and then can begin to suffer and at least start to weep for what happened and how I let someone down in a relationship. She being my best friend, at the time. 
I just feel so so angry with myself and what happened. And can‚Äôt begin to break through my own emotions to start feeling something as a result. I grew up around a narcissistic family and now believe my father to be a sociopath too. I am now an adult and can see that but I am not one but now with all that I have realised has happened in my life I can‚Äôt begin to start feeling all of my rage again that was left in me and now just crashes around onto others I love and care about.

19,"I've gone through a lot of psychotic breakdowns in my years even tho I've only recently turned 20. The most significant is when I had someone, but then I didn't. It's really hard to explain and wouldn't make sense if I tried so to put it simply, it felt like what wasn't real was and what was, wasn't. It's happened a few times, although not that often, twice this year. It starts as a small thought and then it goes to a point where it almost feels like grief; like I've lost something or someone and now I don't know what to do with myself. The first time this happened I was only 15 and I ended up doing a lot of stupid things because of said breakdown. I won't go into detail as a lot of it was illegal and I regret it every day of my life. Another reason why I won't say exactly what happened is because I don't remember the majority of it. It was like I was possessed but I knew I wasn't (?). I don't know how else to explain it.

Writing things down every now and then has definitely helped me feel more real even tho that also doesn't make sense...  
I guess sometimes it can start as a thought or a slight obsession over something and then it blows up into something totally different that I just can't control.  
I have depression, anxiety, a tic disorder (developed from these breakdowns and trauma) and am also on the spectrum, and the medication I take, although known to cause psychosis, isn't to blame as this has been going on since before I started taking it.  
I'm not writing this to ask for advice or anything, I just needed to vent in a public space where my thoughts don't just go into the void or in one ear out the other y'know.

Before, I didn't really know what to think of the breakdowns but after I lost both my grandmother and my cat (whom I've had since I was a baby) I've recognised the feeling I get as grief or loss of some sort. Like there's a void that's been placed inside me and can't ever be filled again.  
Obviously this also enables my depression and suicidal tendencies to kick in and have a party in my brain, tho I know how to deal with it as I've been here before and I know it gets better after a while.  
Idk how to end this rant is there you go I guess

as someone with very severe abandonment issues and borderline personality disorder traits i think its safe to say you‚Äôre a terrible person if you threaten to leave me or block me out of pure spite. Usually jokes like that wouldn‚Äôt be harmful, but to do these pranks and shenanigans to people you blatantly know has abandonment trauma is just downright revolting. Its very hard for me to maintain healthy, non-toxic relationships due to my disorder and by doing insensitive shit like that it just makes things a lot harder to deal with.

I don't want to go to a GP for meds because I had bad side effects with two SSRIs, my psychiatrist had said the next step was trying a mood stabilizer, and that seems like a bit much for a brand new to me gp to set me up with.

23,"Everyday (f18) feel like I‚Äôm just wasting my brain. This will probably sound like I‚Äôm bragging but I feel the context is important. I‚Äôll start off with some background. I come from two very smart families, dads side all has multiple degrees, his iq is genius level (although that test is pretty meaningless), went to a top 20 school on scholarship because his family had no money. He‚Äôs gotten to where he is based on his ability. Mother is even brighter than him. They both deal with alcoholism, my father is a narcissist, probably depressed too. My mother has diagnosed anxiety and depression. So I‚Äôm a grand mix of all of it. I‚Äôm 18 and ending my first semester at the same school my dad went to. I have adhd, depression, and anxiety. Although I feel like there are aspects of mania that are not talked about. I take prescription medication daily. 

At night I don‚Äôt sleep because my brain is constantly buzzing. My thoughts go 100mph and I can‚Äôt get them to stop. Now that I‚Äôm in college, access to drugs and alcohol is easier. Although at home is was easy to swipe something from the liquor cabinet. Often I‚Äôll smoke weed, more recently I‚Äôve been drinking. Something I swore off when I was a kid since I knew it ran in the family. 

I‚Äôm always bored, I‚Äôve stopped doing my work, I drink at night and stay up to 6am. I‚Äôm a design student, so I can pass by throwing shit together and having a bs explanation. I know my professors are catching on since my quality of work is decreasing. I show up to zoom class with bags under my eyes from not sleeping. I‚Äôve always wanted to do this, but the classes are all foundational right now. I don‚Äôt solve problems anymore, there‚Äôs no challenge except time management. I feel like I‚Äôve lost all my creativity and potential. I used to have such great ideas, I used to do amazing work, and be so smart. Now I do nothing productive all day. I wish I was learning again, using my brain. I‚Äôve never been a math person but I find myself missing it from highschool. 

 I almost want to drop out but I know that I would just stay at home all day. And I love my life here in college. But I feel so wasted. I‚Äôm not the best in my class, other people are doing such better work with an actual work ethic. So what am I doing here? I want to be innovating, not practicing the basics over and over again. I know that‚Äôs important, it‚Äôs integral in the art of design. But it‚Äôs killing me, I‚Äôm bored with my education. I always become bored with things. 

It feels so stuck up to say but I feel smarter than so many people. I‚Äôll talk to them and it‚Äôs just a routine, an act. I want to challenge my brain and have intellectual conversations with someone. But in my gen Ed‚Äôs people just feel dumb. I‚Äôm not the smartest person in the school, far from it, but I can‚Äôt understand how people don‚Äôt see the answers like I do. It seems so obvious to me. People have always called me sharp since I‚Äôm great at analysis. I make shit up as I go and it works. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel so clich√©, oh I‚Äôm so smart poor me, life is boring. But it is. I have joy, although I don‚Äôt have hobbies, but I can see the beauty in the world. I have friends, and family, and a cat. But I‚Äôm not sure I have a future. I could easily finish school and get a mundane little job if I got my act together. But the problem is, that‚Äôs not what I want. I want to use my brain again.

29,"Hi! My name is Zo√´, I‚Äôm 18 and I have been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder for two years now. I have been on various medications, done many different types of therapy, and even was admitted to a psychiatric facility for a while. 

Honestly I have ruined many relationships, including between my mom and I, my sisters and significant others! I struggle with remaining true to my feelings all the time I‚Äôve noticed, which is part of BPD, but knowing that doesn‚Äôt make it any easier to navigate realities and extreme feelings. 

When I was 17 I was kicked out of my house for many reasons, but I moved with distant family and went very downhill, trying to figure out my mental health. 9 months ago I met my boyfriend and two months ago I moved in with him. 

This sounds reckless or fast to some people. And it honestly is, but it‚Äôs just how I deal with things and this time I made sure it was the healthiest way! ( if that makes sense?) 

I have very much been struggling with the levels in which my emotions happen, and discerning whether or not my anger or extreme sadness is justified. 

I guess my question is, how do I tell if I‚Äôm over reacting, if I‚Äôm being a great big ass, or if I‚Äôm allowed to feel that way? And if I‚Äôm not allowed to feel that way, then how do I calm my brain down enough to stop feeling that way?

My whole life, in addition to my struggles with depression, anxiety and self esteem, I have lacked self control around food and even as a small child found finish a whole family bag for chips without thinking. This, of course, made my mother upset and that's when I realized that it wasn't normal and was an issue.

However, now as a 22 year old woman, I still struggle. But now it's also with money. Let me admit, I am the type that doesn't think they'll amount to much in life and I could lay on the couch for hours. I have turned into that person who spends money on phone games to pass the time but it's to a point where it'll actually put a dent in my bank account.

33,"I don‚Äôt even know where to start. I don‚Äôt know if anyone can relate but i feel like I need to get a lot of stuff off my chest but I can‚Äôt put out the words? 

It‚Äôs about my girlfriend and me. We‚Äôve been together since December last year and it‚Äôs been amazing since then. Lockdown was a really big hit for us and I‚Äôm mind blown that we are still together after it. We‚Äôve had really bad rough patches in the past and we‚Äôve had really good parts too. Through lockdown we were both mentally doing very badly. She felt very suicidal and we spoke about it a lot of nights and I tried desperately to help in every way I could. One morning in lockdown around about april she woke up extra late for when she normally wakes up and I spent the entire almost 6 hours I was awake without her being awake absolutely paranoid. She hasn‚Äôt felt as suicidal or bad since then but recently she feels bad again. And this time it‚Äôs sort of rubbing off on me and I feel bad too. Our relationship has been suffering and slowly getting worse for the last few weeks. We both know that we will be so bad without each other though so we can‚Äôt leave each other. We don‚Äôt want to do anything without each other and if we lost each other we‚Äôd be so lost, or at least I would :(

For the last few weeks we‚Äôve recognised that our relationship is getting worse and that it‚Äôs getting to the point where it could be bad for us and we‚Äôve been trying so hard to fix it. This week however we both were in contact with someone who has COVID so I can‚Äôt see her this week and missing each other is really bad for us :( it causes problems :( we argue a lot more and we sometimes say things we don‚Äôt mean :( Ok I was trying not to. But I‚Äôm crying now :) anyway, we‚Äôre both getting worse and tonight we were talking again and we both have so little effort left that I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen. She says she wouldn‚Äôt really care if she died and that she wishes she was dead, at the same time she‚Äôs having second thought about me so it‚Äôs really rubbing off on me and I feel like utter shit :( she asked me what the fastest way to kill yourself was tonight but said ‚Äújust asking, it‚Äôs not serious‚Äù but it still scares me. And then she went to sleep. So she‚Äôs asleep right now. And I‚Äôm awake scared shitless :( I don‚Äôt know how to help her or myself or our relationship üò≠ I don‚Äôt even know if this is the right subreddit for this :( the short story is I can‚Äôt lose her and she can‚Äôt lose me but we also can‚Äôt lost ourselves. And then there‚Äôs school grades and everything else. It‚Äôs just too much :( I just came to the closest thing I could think of. I just need help üò≠ It took me so much effort to write even just this post. I‚Äôm scared sad and anxious and my attention span is 0. I don‚Äôt even know if I got the whole story across in this but I can‚Äôt write anymore. If you have any questions I‚Äôm very happy to answer them üò≠ thank you so much :(

36,I'm currently on mission with covid 19. Iv been on since March. Iv lost 2 uncles. Lost my home. My parents went to Florida. I haven't seen my nephews in months. I put my relationship with my gf on pause. Because she's been distant. And when I told her my uncle died(this happened the same week) she said ok. And nothing else. And hasn't visited me during the mission. (BTW she was unemployed at one point and offered her multiple times to visit me out of my pocket).I feel alone out of shap. And the pure need of self harm. And swallowing all of my pills. I dont have anything in my life. And feel like a constant disappointment. I keep hearing that suicide is painless song in my head.,28Nov2020,1

39,"Apologies in advance if this post is a little jumbled. I'm struggling to put all of this into words.

I (18M) feel very, very frustrated and I can't pinpoint the reason. I can't help but feel like maybe I'm overreacting, but after several instances of crying to myself with little to no provocation, I wonder if I'm hitting an all-time low. I feel like I'm losing it; I'm not a suicidal person, I'm not a self-harm person. I'm fully aware of the consequences, and I *guess* you could say I value my life, but... What is there to do anymore? Where am I headed? How can I stop this feeling?

Several circumstances have enabled me into becoming a shut-in, such as the quarantine, the fact I graduated back in May, am not ready for college, cannot find a job, and the way my parents just ‚Äî‚Äî let this all happen to me? I don't know, they aren't the comforting type, they aren't the sorts to notice I'm not okay. They enable me into hiding from the adult world by simply not giving me the push I'd like. 

Though... I should probably talk about them a little, first. I don't have a better word for them. They aren't abusive (or are they?), but they're irresponsible. I am the oldest sibling out of four (15M / 6M / 6F), and my parents don't work. Our only source of income is asking relatives for money under any lie/pretense/excuse, or preferably using me or my brother to make it more possible. As ridiculous and unreal as that sounds, it's been this way for years. After years of this, I've come to label them as the sorts of people I'd least like to become. I want to succeed. I want to get somewhere in life. I would do anything, anything, to not become like them. Even so... with all of these circumstances at hand... I become more and more like them by the day.

I have never been the sort of guy that hangs out with people after school. I have very little memories of enjoyable experiences with friends outside of that environment. In part because of not wanting to spend money, but mostly because my parents have always tried to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù me. This ‚Äúprotection‚Äù has not allowed me to grow up into the proper, socially capable person I wish I were. They have not let me grow up. As embarrassed as I am to say this, I, at 18 years of age, feel like I have not aged beyond the age of 15. And it's driving me nuts.

I have not spoken to any friends physically since August (and even before that, I had been months on end without physical contact). To begin with I've always valued my online friends more than my real-life friends; as much as I enjoy physical company, I've always felt like I was never the most valued in my social circle (which makes total sense, considering how much I've absented and neglected out-of-school communication with them). After graduating, and realizing I had to preserve these people because they're the only close-distance people I have, I tried my best to change.

Back in August, to attempt to recover the lost summer, I tried hanging out with one of these friends after so long. It was fun. It was fantastic. But on the other hand, my parents were losing their shit, and were urging me to get back home although they hadn't given me a time to return before (I had been out since like, midday till 5/6PM). With how superstitious my parents are (they correctly suspect I'm gay, but incorrectly suspect I have been on numerous ‚Äúsexcapades‚Äù when in truth I absolutely dread the concept of sexual interactions), and with how discreet I've always been about my personal life towards them (especially since turning 18), further attempts to hang out with people turned complicated. They wanted to know who are the people I chill with. I got defensive. 

During this time I was temporarily forbidden to go out (it was more like me waiting out the storm until a a week or two to ask again), I had a one-sided text argument with my ‚Äúbest‚Äù friend because of my inability to go out. Well, it was more like me sending her a textwall that she didn't really properly read, but you get me. Ever since then I've enabled myself even further into becoming a shut-in until I get my shit together. I overindulged in my one hobby, roleplaying/writing, while watching out for potential jobs to pick up before whenever I start college (frankly I didn't even get a good enough GPA to get into any course better than a 1-year course, but moving on). And also for the day I could take a driver's permit. I want an apartment, I want to move out of this toxic household so bad, there's so many things I want to do but... What am I even doing? 

Fast forward to the present, I'm absolutely stumped. I try to convince myself to be happy, but the moment I hit a writer's block, I remember all of these problems. With how creatively blocked I've been recently, I've had to come face-to-face with this sinking frustration over my direction in life far more than usual. Combine that with the way my online friends have been so busy lately. The pain I was trying to drown out with my hobbies just keeps swelling and swelling. I've vented to them far more than usual, my creative rambles have become far more unreasonable and unstable... and I wonder if I'm annoying them? Do I even want to continue frustrating them with this unsolvable problem? 

What. Do. I. Do? What is the best thing to do? I have so much expectations to fulfill. Social expectations, ‚Äúadult world‚Äù expectations, the overly ambitious expectations I place upon myself and tear myself up with. But so little guidance and confidence to get them done. Life feels so repetitive, so exhausting, so uninteresting. And I want that to change. Am I really just exaggerating? Am I just being a spoiled brat? I don't know.",28Nov2020,1

43,"I have been taking a strong anti psychotic mental health medication since 2015 called Aripiprazole. I originally started on the maximum dose which is 30mg. Since 2015 i have had this reduced, and I had managed to get it down to 15mg in 2018. In 2018 however, I also started on an anti depressant (sertraline) my dose was 50mg. 

I was prescribed the aripiprazole before my 7 month stay on a children's mental health ward when I was 15. 

Since taking the medication, the doctor immediately mentioned to me that my LFTs (liver function tests) were out of range.

Now, in 2020, I began to show symptoms of jaundice. And I have recently been diagnosed with glandular fever, which is known to affect/take a toll on your liver. My bilirubin and related liver tests were more than double what they were supposed to be and were rapidly rising. I was admitted to hospital a couple of weeks ago, and stayed in for a week on a short stay ward. 

After leaving hospital, I felt that the cause of the liver stress and damage was because of the strong medication I had been taking, so I stopped. I told the doctor about my decision and she said that it was up to me and if I felt like I could deal with my mental health then fine. 

But its like; take this medication and your liver will suffer. Or, do not take it, and risk the possibility of an unlikely relapse. 

Is this right :s my bloods were also supposed to be monitored on my medication but they never were. 

Since stopping my medication, my LFTs have halved (improved significantly). But I constantly wonder if I have made the right decision.",28Nov2020,1

45,"I was taking a depression medicine. I have one more pill left before I'm done with it. Life is truly sh\*t right now. Getting off the medicine is making me sick and I'm sick with some other un-diagnosable illness. About 2 months ago when I was about to fall asleep, I would hear a soft little tune (that as far as I know, I could only hear.) When the tune would start up, that's when I knew that I was being recorded. It was hard to not jump up and start trashing my room to find the bugs in my room. After 2 weeks of staying up later unable to sleep because of an individual trying to watch me and hear me sleep, I realized it's not real. I am 100% creating this scenario in my head, I made the executive decision to stop taking it. I didn't say anything to anyone about my experience, (there is other stuff, like starting to believe my dad is actually a vampire that is just a very convincing human.) I only told my dad that I'm getting off it, because I don't like it anymore. 

Only until recently did I tell him what I was actually going through. It's extremely embarrassing for me to have experienced this. I pride myself on being well-rounded and level headed.

47,"I knew the time would come. My mother was extremely ill. I just..didnt expect it to be so soon.

Her power went out, and her portable oxygen wasnt working. They called 911 to get her somewhere that can stabilize her oxygen. She didnt want to. 

That was Saturday. Her roommate filled me in on everything. She was told she was unconscious but will be okay and possibly has pneumonia. 

Few days ago the doctor called me. Told me she had bleeding in her brain from a fall. Something wrong with her similar to blood clots (i dont know what it was cold) and another heart problem (again cant remember what it was called..). The heart problem is fatal if not treated in about a year. They told me she may need surgery to get a breathing machine hooked up to her. That they are unsure on the blood thinners. She may end up in a nursing home which I knew she wouldnt like.

Then thanksgiving night at 10 pm they call me again.

She isnt gonna make it.

I couldnt speak. I didnt know what to say.

About an hour later another doctor calls to tell me they are gonna have to turn everything off and let nature take its course.

I cried. I told the doctor my life has been hell since I lost my job. People harassing me, my bird sick with avian gastric yeast, bearded dragon having tail rot, constant arguing with my partner, depression hitting me the hardest its ever had in my life.
We just moved, we are constantly busy and leaving and needing to go somewhere to get stuff done.
I told her I didnt have time to see her and I tried to make time, just when I had free time I felt so depressed I couldnt move. They let me see her. I woke my partner up at midnight to go see her.

I was there about an hour, crying, talking to her quietly, to my partner. 

They only let me see her for an hour, and could not watch her pass. 

They turned everything off, and I went home.

They called me at 2:47 to let me know my mother had passed at exactly 2:11 am.

49,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety as well as PTSD and an eating disorder several years ago. 

A couple years ago I moved across states and didn‚Äôt get a new psychiatrist or therapist. (I also had a baby and at that point had been off meds without therapy for well over a year.) finally in January of this year I went to a new clinic. 

At first, I got along well with my therapist and I wanted to try to go without meds because I was still breastfeeding. That didn‚Äôt really work out and I saw a psychiatrist in February. 

Right off the bat she diagnosed me with Bipolar 2 and prescribed latuda. (Before then I‚Äôd only had super low doses of Zoloft, occasionally Xanax, and occasionally trazodone.) i freaked, didn‚Äôt want to give up breastfeeding and didn‚Äôt call her back. 

Then in June things got really bad. Like life-threatening bad on the depression front. So I went back to see her. She insisted on the diagnosis and medication. 

I took it for about 2 months before I couldn‚Äôt handle the side effects anymore and the negative impact they were having on my life. She even increased my dose at one point and told me that the effects would become more bearable with time. I get that blood toxicity levels need to adjust. But I was in danger of falling asleep while watching my 2 year old son. 

So I tried to call the clinic for help about going off my meds and they never called me back. I went off them anyway and she was upset at the next appointment about it. I told her about all the times I called and all the emails they sent there but apparently she didn‚Äôt receive any. 

She prescribed lamictal then and I‚Äôve been taking it since august. Thankfully the blackness isn‚Äôt as bad and I‚Äôm not a danger to myself anymore. But my anxiety is definitely worse. 

On top of all that, I‚Äôve been researching bipolar and I realized that she definitely jumped to conclusions in our one hour appointment, used improper justifications for diagnosing me bipolar, and pretty much ignored all my previous medical history....I‚Äôve never actually had a manic episode. 

In our last appointment she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to increase your dosage, but I‚Äôm pretty sure you won‚Äôt let me.‚Äù

I truly feel that I have Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, not anxiety with bipolar 2 like she said. I don‚Äôt want to face her again because it feels like she‚Äôs not listening to me. And I‚Äôm really nervous about contacting the clinic for a new psychiatrist and that they won‚Äôt believe me about my misdiagnosis anyway. 

I also have a new therapist that I‚Äôve only had one appointment with because my old one got promoted and the replacement one didn‚Äôt fit with me (it felt like she didn‚Äôt have her shit together and the appointments became stressful.)

It feels like I‚Äôve become this high-maintenance patient and they‚Äôre just going to discredit me. But Tuesday I plan to talk to my new therapist about what to do...even though we‚Äôve only spoken once. 

Any words of encouragement, advice, or support would be wonderful. Thanks. 

TL;DR after a decade in treatment my new therapist diagnosed me bipolar 2 earlier this year. I think she‚Äôs wrong but she‚Äôs already questioned my judgement and I‚Äôm afraid nobody at the clinic will believe me.",28Nov2020,1

55,"I've been struggling with some thoughts lately and i thought it might be therapeutic to write them down or perhaps even share them. My twenties were difficult because i spent much of the first half in the American military and much of the second half in and out of hospitals for mental wellness reasons. Now, in my early thirties i find myself medicated, and mostly lucid, with some occasional laughing fits and an obsession with one evening in May of 2014 which i will refer to as field camp. 

There are things i remember about that night, like sharpening a stick for smores, looking up at the stars, falling off a table i was dancing on, and waking up on top of glow sticks. I was told by someone who attended that there were arguments that night. Immediately after the night in question there were some weird happenings that convinced me there was an event i cannot recall clearly, or accurately, but an event that now controls many of my thoughts. 

The most aggravating memory is the day after the event. I was sitting on a stool in a kitchen speaking with a classmate when two women walked in. The older one walked right up close to my face and said, ""look at me."" She stared into my eyes for maybe five seconds until i looked away and then she said, ""Yupp."" and all three of them walked out. I find this memory to be evidence that something traumatic really did take place on the previous night and they were involved in it.

I spent the summer of 2014 absolutely tripping about shit and ended up checking myself into a mental facility. When i returned to school in the fall more unusual events happened with my old classmates but they are hard to describe without proper context and an exact description of the entire memory. A few examples would be unusual staring, unusual drawings, and unusual interactions sometimes with objects. I felt strongly that these happenings were referential to field camp.

Sometime in 2014 i went to my sisters apartment. Her behavior was weird but i don't really care about that. What upsets me is that there was a riddle above her kitchen table in a picture frame. It was just text that read, and i'm paraphrasing for lack of memory, but it said, ""a boy becomes head of security and loses his head in a swamp. How do you rub his face in it? You can't, it's impossible."" At the time, my sister said it was art, and years later, she called it a poem. The reason that memory sticks in my head is because i feel it was something i said after falling off the table at field camp and something that sometime later, ended up over her kitchen table. The bottom of the riddle said the word, ""butches"". Butch is my fathers nickname.

I cannot provide much context for the next example but i will add it as one of many unusual memories that summer. During my battle with my mental health i confided in a family friend. On our second or third meeting we met at starbucks and she asked if she could record me. So she did. I cannot remember much of the conversation but near the end she told me she thought i was a hybrid alien and kept winking at me. Then she said i work backwards. Now, i feel it necessary to mention that at no point did i think i was an alien, nor did i speak about aliens. I feel the alien comment is a reference to field camp perhaps, or her attempt to goad me into a mental facility.

This next one bothers me, because so many things bothered me about that summer, but it is an unusual event to witness. I was at a restaurant having lunch with my mother and some of her husbands family. His elderly mother was there and towards the end of the meal she raised her fist and announced, ""women are strong!"" to which i replied, ""and men are so meek and mild."" A few minutes later she began massaging my shoulders while i was in my seat. This was the first time i met her and i only really find this so unusual because of the other things that happened that summer. My mother told me that this lady really liked me.

There are many other events that happened or events that upset me. I find it hard to discern whether i am delusional or have been collectively fucked with. It's been over six and a half years since field camp but the amount of time and energy that has been expended thinking about this is enormous. I will likely never find out what happened, and it saddens me, because i am afraid that i'll dwell on this forever.",28Nov2020,1

My own girlfriend has commented on it, she's very into music and movies and she's complained about how we never discuss it together and has said that I have ""no interests.""

It feels like I constantly have a big hole in my chest. I cry a lot when I'm alone, or drunk, when it gets overwhelming. But I just feel indifferent most of the time.

Socialising with others is exhausting as it feels like I have to put on a performance, acting energetic and engaged. After a while, when I stop performing, they leave, thinking I'm rude or boring as I don't have much to say to them and I appear very emotionally ""flat.""

In truth, I don't feel like I have a personality, or like I'm a real human. I study a lot so I can feel ""valuable"" because I have nothing else in my life and if I don't get enough work done in a day I tend to feel guilty and worthless.

I don't think it's depression as I am pretty functional and my life is going well right now. I've never had any serious thoughts of self-harm/suicide.  I probably sound angsty but I don't know what's wrong with me and I just really want to feel like a normal person.",28Nov2020,1
57,"I am feeling so alone right now. Adult son came home from being in the military for 15 years, moved in with my husband and myself, he suffers from PTSD and just general depression.  He has been with us for 3 years and is now going to school and in a program which will take three years. He will continue to live with us.  In June his 11 year old daughter came to live with us after suffering years of mental and emotional abuse from her step father.  My husband is in cognitive decline, he had to stop driving recently because he was not safe behind the wheel.  We are retired and downsized to a small 2 bedroom house kn 2013 so we are squeezed tight and there really isn't any room for anyone to get away from anyone else.  Been married 46 years and my husband was often abusive, we had gotten to a decent point in our relationship, over the past several years, but I have always had to take care of him emotionally.  I retired in 2012 and had a pretty good life, very active, we traveled and vacationed a lot, just enjoying life.  Now, I am living with people who have all these issues and somehow I am supposed to be the one every one else leans on.  No one takes even a moment to see if I am OK.  I do all of the shopping, cooking, most of the cleaning, organizing, just generally keep the house running.  So here I sit and all I want to do is cry.  My husband can't remember things moment to moment, he falls down a lot, he is often just in a fog and I am so angry that I have to take care of him. He has never really extended himself to me, he is a selfish person and it just pisses me off I am now in this position and it is only going to get worse.  I am mad that, at 70, my life is really over.  I am as housebound as he is.  My son is little help as he is just not a very empathetic person and he gets angry at  his Dad pretty easily.  The 11 year old stomps through the house, gets angry if you ask her to do anything, can't talk in a normal tone, always so loud, even in normal conversation. I have one other son who will listen to me to an extent, he views me as someone who can do it all, someone who always has it together and he doesn't want to see me weak in any way. I have one good friend but she is on long term disability for mental problems, both her grown children have major problems so talking to her revolves around her daughters.  I just have no where to turn right now and am starting to have some medical issues of my own. I just feel like I am juggling all these emotions and at some point I am going to explode.",28Nov2020,1

(I didn't arrange it, someone arranged it for me)

I just migrated to a different country. I got diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder last year. I was gonna be put on antidepressants after a few months of therapy but I never came back to see my psychiatrist because of financial issues.

Is seeing a psychiatrist without a referral okay? 
What should I expect on my first appointment?
Is there anything specific I need to tell him?

Last time I saw a psychiatrist, I was given a prescription for seroquel for my sleep problem.

Truth is, I'm a bit scared and nervous cause I might be told I'm just overreacting. I wanted to cancel the appointment but I didn't arrange it so cancelling it might hurt the person who arranged it for me.

62,"17f, UK, please read this im out of ideas of where I can go for advice.

I was bullied from the age of 3 or 4 when I started going to nursery. It still hasn't really stopped if I'm honest and this made people not speak to me so they wouldn't join me.

I was groped repeatedly during my 6th year at primary school (between ages 10 and 11) by a guy a year older. Still no one takes this as a serious problem in my mental health. Only support I was offered was Personal and Social Education with the boy who did it.

I was then sexually assaulted. After 6 months I figured I needed real help after my bf talked me down from atempting suicide the first time. 

The school told my parents (they do not have to do this as I would happily of complied with both social work and police) that I'd been sexually assaulted. This broke me and my parents relationship.

The school after a while of me seeing a councelor working for a different place but seeing me at school found out my diagnosis (depression, anxiety, PTSD) the school claimed they were worried for my safety (I don't believe they had any grounds and never brought it up again) and arranged a meeting.

They then told my parents about my mental health struggles and my parents reacted badly again thinking me an attention seeker and week and stupid.

Now I live in homeless accommodation, no one speaks to me really, I still do counseling but no longer trust anything is confidential so panic after each meeting.

I've now had several week attempts at suicide, covered my hip in self harm scars and fully believe my death will be a suicide. I can't get the level of care I feel i need either.",28Nov2020,1
63,"I am stressing out quite a bit.  

One of my biggest fears is staying in my hometown. I regret not leaving for college immediately, but I had no money and didn't want student loans, so I opted to stay for undergrad. I regret it immensely but I am almost done and out with a math major. 

I was offered an amazing position to work on my masters at the university, because they appreciate my work, but the thought of staying in my hometown terrifies me in ways I cannot express. I fully intend to stay in academia, but  I feel trapped here, I feel bored, I get no joy knowing every corner, every store, every hidden alleyway. I hate being so close to my conversion therapy center, and I hate living with my parents who sent me (we are currently pretending nothing happened, and I am living with fear, and anger and so much resentment that I can't shake because I live with them, and they hurt me).  I hate that I have so few friends and I can't form any meaningful lasting relationships.  I have tried seeking therapy, but I haven't found a good therapist. All of them misgender me (I am a trans man) and I do not trust them. I have so many nightmares of never leaving. Its almost every night at this point.

I almost feel rabid about the whole situation. I want out. I thrash about sometimes and scream when I am alone. The worst part is that I don't fully understand why I want to leave. I have a hard time taking care of myself and I am worried I can't do it. I don't know what's wrong with me. I zone out, I forget to eat, I have trouble connecting with others, and I just want to do it right. I just want to be enough somewhere.  I know that anywhere I go, my mind goes with me, but I can't take any more of this boring. I just need one more year to graduate, and I am holding out until then, but I really needed to get this off my chest because I can't take it.

65,"You can say I was loved in my high school and I had great unforgettable experiences, until I started college where I was extra focused on studying and spent most of my time pursuing my dream job, however I didnt make many friends and lost that feeling of company over time that made me soo lonely, it changed who I am, what i believe in, what do I really want... I was simply lost in my thought of who really I am, until the moment that changed my perspective on life. I met this amazing guy, he was a very sociable guy and very popular in our college, we can say he knows everyone and everyone knows him...
He saw something in me that I still wonder what it is, that made him want to hang out with me and  eventually we became best friends, he made me stronger, he was pushing me to live and love life, he opened my eyes with his ambition, I love this guy like my brother, he pushed me out of my comfort zone, I started meeting people, getting more connections. People loved me, they started inviting me to there parties, but I really still dont know why (I know I have lost self esteem) they invite such depressed individual to those events.
I started getting famous, people asking about me, girls whispering behind my back and laughing, I really needed this attention it gave me the validation I needed. I was confused  why is everyone interested in me I lost the sensibility of who I am, because of this lonely phase that I spent in my past 3 years. 
People say I look like a very famous rapper, maybe this is what attracted them.
I loved this attention even though it wasnt for who I am as a person, but just because of my physical characteristics, not long enough until i started to hate it, because no one knows who I am as a human, I dont blame them because I dont know who I am.
I started focusing on myself more, studying social dynamics, reading books, working out, started a hobby.
The books made me analyse social situations even more that it made sit as a spectator studying the social dynamics. I was improving physically, mentally, financially but not my social skills, which I believe is key step in reaching my life goals and dreams. I am afraid to practise what I read or engage in a non formal conversation that will not be boring...

67,"I'm not sure where to start other then the fact I'm 6 weeks postpartum and I no longer feel like a person.. 

My daughter is my absolute world but I don't know how to deal with my mind and my thoughts.. 

I've been on antidepressants since 2 weeks postpartum and I'm not sure if they just haven't started working or they aren't working at all. 

Everyday I have to fight to figure out what is reality because I'm hearing voices trying to dictate everything I do. That I'm feeding her wrong, that I'm going to underfeed her and she's going to die of malnutrition. That she is going to stop breathing and when she dies due to that, that I might as well just kill myself because I can't even keep my daughter alive. They tell me constantly to start cutting again and that no one will find out because it's not like I get intimate with my partner, it's not like I wear shorts or dresses. No one would known if I started cutting again. Only me.. They tell me to stop eating because I've already gained so much weight from being pregnant, yet I know I'm not fat but in the mirror all I can see is loose skin and my massive body. 

I'm scared because I don't know if it's my daughter actually crying or if it's just in my head. I can't sleep because shes going to stop breathing or she's going to die keeps running through my head. So I'm staying awake to make sure I can always hear her and can help if something happens. 

She looks so healthy but I can't tell now if her eyes look normal or if her skin has always been the colour it is. I know she's healthy but in my mind she is on the verge of death and if I don't act right or do everything right she's going to pass away in my arms or in her bed. 

I'm scared to go to the bathroom when my partner is as work and she's asleep because I could take too long. 

I'm at the point where my eyes are dry from crying and my throat burns from dry heaving. I'm not sure the last time I properly slept more then an hour to two hours at a time. I don't want to be alive anymore.. I want to relapse and let it consume my day to day again. I want to be fixated on the blade and the pills to get through my day. 

I keep a pen and paper close in case I have to write to my boyfriend and family that I'm an unfit mother and that I love them so very much but I can't take this life anymore, that I no longer have the will to live. 

I have a book full of letters to my daughter for when she is old enough in case I decide to take my life and won't be there for her. I'll let her know that I loved her with everything in my soul and that I'm watching her grow up from above. There will be letters there for every birthday, major holidays, her graduation, when she gets engaged, married, when she decides to have kids of her own if she does. I'll put my necklace in there for her and a picture of her and I together just so I know she has them. 

I plan to start the same thing for my partner. Letting him know how much he means to me and that he is a wonderful father. I'll write all our love letters out for him to keep, the poems I've wrote specifically for him. I'll find something to leave for him, pictures, my rings. Just something that he can remember me but small enough so he can move on. I'll apologize I wasn't a better partner and a better parent. I'll tell him it isn't his fault, that he can't blame himself..

80,"  

Experience/story that I kept for years, and I think I was brave enough to share it now.

I was on leave at work that day. Knowing my uncle will come home at lunch, I lied on the upper bunk of the bed. As the clock ticks, someone entered the room. With deep and heavy footsteps, he went directly to my bed. I was petrified! Panic rushes in me, but I kept hidden at the top to hide my presence. The next thing I knew and have heard. He was already sniffing my bed. I was shaking and disgusted by that thought, knowing that he was a perfect figure of a father and a role model. I could hear him sniffing my bed for almost 2-5 mins. After that, he stood up! And looked at the bed where I am lying. I don't know if he saw me, but I think he did!

1:00 PM, he went back to work. That was the time I got up and puzzled. Realizing what has happened. Did he really do that? I was afraid of the answers I might get in the internet. I shake it off and did not bothered to let my cousins know what has happened. 

But, every day passed by. Anxiety and panic is building up in my system. I knew it was not normal! I avoided him. I never want to talk, hear his voice, worst is to see his face. I was really disgusted!

Fast forward....

Every time I wake up, I make sure my bedding is smooth. (You know what I mean. Please don't judge my writing. I hate writing essay and I'm bad at it). 

Before, I go to work I constantly checked my bedding if it is crumpled or what so I can fix it before I go.

I went home and saw my bedding in a state where it was not where I had just leaved it 8 hours ago. The lower part is still smooth. But the upper part where my neck or head was already crumpled. Like someone has just buried his face on it. And it leave MARKS of nose or something.  

I don't know if you would believed me,  but, I am too! I could not believe it myself!! My anxiety and uneasiness against that man is really piling up. I was really scared but I kept mum and kept it to myself. 

Third proof, we all went to vacation and he was left behind. To prove and reassure myself. I made sure to fix my bed smoothly. Memorized everytime details of my bed, so I could see if some parts are still crumpled. Took a picture of it, just in case my brain will disorient and confuse me that I leave my bedding crumpled.

Days after our vacation, we went home. 

Guess what??!

I just got a proof that he was indeed secretly sniffing my bed!!!! I was afraid to leave a camera but I'm afraid I'll get caught. So, I checked the before picture of my bed and POSITIVE üò≠üòñüò£ü§Æü§¢ Upper part was crumpled, but the lower is not. 

I was really dumbfounded!!! I want to cry! I am really terrified and don't know what to do. I was contemplating if I will let my cousin know what I had experienced. But I'm afraid. I don't want them to judge him, coz he was a perfect figure of a father, a son, a sibling and a model to my relatives. I decided to keep it to myself and just confirm it, though I had already my answers. 

I don't really want him around and his presence disgusted me. I don't have a choice, since I have nowhere to go. 

My question that I have been thinking for years now is that....

Is he a maniac?

Though, he sometimes kisses my forehead, saying I am liked his kid.  

I was really disgusted just by looking at his face.

I just want to apologize if I made you uncomfortable with regard to my writing. Writing has always been my weakness ever since, and I'm afraid I can not get a scholarship due to my bad writing skills.

By the way, I am planning to moved out. To study as an International student abroad not only to just to go away but also to really chase for my dreams. But I sucked at writing, I hope I could get a scholarship grant asap so I can no longer see his face  again.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Am I being judgmental or what?

Up to now, I'm really scared.

Please help.

Thank you and God bless.",28Nov2020,1
81,"I understand that this may be offensive to some, but I want to be clear that I mean no harm whatsoever. I‚Äôm really curious about what your opinions are on this. Since early childhood, I‚Äôve struggled with both my weight and anxiety. As I entered my teens, depression was added to the mix, and I still struggle with that at 20. Truthfully, I wonder if I‚Äôll ever be rid of these things. I‚Äôve seen 3-4 different doctors/mental health professionals concerning my problems. In fact, throughout the spring semester of my freshman year of college, I was worried that I had pulmonary embolisms, congestive heart failure, lung cancer, or something like that because I always had so much trouble breathing. Doctors kept telling me my lungs were fine but ultimately gave me inhalers and breathing treatments for asthma. Looking back, I truly believe that anxiety was the primary culprit, not asthma. Despite all the meetings I had with professionals about my mental health, my physical health was rarely discussed. They may have mentioned in passing that I might consider lowering my weight if i wanted to do that, get more exercise, eat more of certain foods, etc., but no one outright told me that higher levels of body fat certainly impact chemical balances in our brains or that losing weight would cause positive physical changes in my brain. In short, more vast fat = more cortisol. Instead, i spent most of the past 7 years on antidepressants/anti anxiety medications. (To be clear, in most circumstances, I‚Äôm in favor of medication for short periods of time and when monitored well, but not as a solution to a fixable problem.) Now, I‚Äôm getting more into exercise and good eating habits, setting fitness goals, losing fat, gaining muscle, all that good stuff. Since doing these things, I feel so much better. My body physically feels better, I‚Äôm not so restless, my anxiety has lessened, my goals give me a greater sense of purpose. Of course, much of this is anecdotal evidence, but it‚Äôs also backed by science. 
Do professionals avoid talking about weight because it‚Äôs a sensitive subject and could make people feel worse about their situation? 
Would it be better to be upfront and honest about the reality of what science says? Are there any rules preventing them from saying this?
Has anyone had an experience in which a mental health professional did tell you straight up that you needed to lose weight? How did that go?

TLDR: since science shows that higher levels of body fat have negative affects on brain chemistry, should mental health professionals advise clients to lose weight?",28Nov2020,1
82,"So, it's obvious that instances of mental illness are on the rise, that's clear from the statistics. What mental health research is telling us is that what's causing our mental health issues are Distorted Thoughts, Negative Thinking, Catastrophizing, not being grateful, and so on.

So I really wonder, at what level of population saturation of mental illness does the current attitude switch to ""hey, maybe those mentally ill people are onto something"". If Mental Illness is continuing to rise, what's the number or % of people afflicted that causes the shift in attitude? 20%? 40% 51%?

83,"I absolutely hate being told that I need to suck it up or that I am too emotional if I happen to let out my feelings about something that bothers me. You think it's that easy for me to just completely disregard my mental state? The phrase of ""you're too sensitive"" is a gaslighting, narcissistic, insensitive, and absolutely merciless way of invalidating another person's feelings. Do I really care if you would not react the same way had you been in my situation? Clearly, I am hurt, I am vulnerable, and I am in need of support. Is it really that hard to find someone that respects you and your tendencies? Apparently it is. 

Anyone that is upset or hurt over things that may seem small to you is not being overreactive or dramatic. That is the way they are, and it is your job not to make them feel any worse than how they already do.",28Nov2020,1
84,"I am a 18F freshman college student in the US working from home. It was manageable at first but it became difficult to hold on. I fell behind, struggled to catch up, and after a while I just gave up unconsciously. I lost total motivation to do work and cried myself to sleep because I felt like I didn't deserve going to my college. In the mix of it my personal-life became worse (we might be losing our apartment, one of my siblings needs countless doctor appointments, my mother is shutting down physically, and my self-confidence is basically nonexistent). My lack of motivation is transferring to not wanting to even leave my bed, to eat, I was ten months free of self harm after four years of doing it in high school (until last week I did it again and I'm experiencing guilt from that as well), and I'm always tired no matter the amount of sleep I get. I am unloading a lot of info which is not even all of it, but I know I might be depressed... I don't want to unload on my mother or friends to add to their stress, going to therapy would mean I'd would have to explain to my mom why I need it, and I'm afraid of explaining how I am feeling to my professors/TAs (especially with it being finals season).

I would imagine it all from it falling to the screaming to me calling 911 and them going to the hospital. Most of the time, this happens involuntary, but I can think about it and it'll be just as bad.

We have to tell her the same things over and over and over and it's like dealing with a child. 
She has never been like this and it's all just come up out of nowhere after all this stress put onto her.

Recently I noticed how incredibly self destructive I am to my relationships because I rely on my self and block everyone out because I‚Äôve only really had myself.

98,"growing up in an Asian house hold, mental health has never been something openly talked about with my family. Both of my parents had very hard childhoods, much tougher than anything I have experienced, and I understand why they don‚Äôt want to discuss negative feelings at all. When I was young I used to cry a lot over small things. My parents didn‚Äôt really help me to calm down and I would hide until I felt better and got over it. I don‚Äôt remember what exactly, but something after that changed and I felt like I was becoming burdensome to my parents so I wanted to be more calm and cause them less stress in life. Going through high school I had a lot of friends, but not very many close ones. I think most people would remember me as being very chill, and humorous. The only people I kept close contact with where classmates I saw everyday and a few other friends. There would be periods of time where I felt hopeless about my future, and my relationship with others. I think I have developed a habit of suppressing my emotions and pretending to be okay. For the entirety of my senior year I felt this way. A constant sadness that I didn‚Äôt think I needed to show anybody, not my family, not my girlfriend, and not any of my friends. I‚Äôve thought about talking about it on social media, but every time I just cringe at imagining myself putting myself out there just for nobody to really care about it and me looking desperate for attention. after a while I noticed myself distancing from my closest friends at school, becoming jealous of other people who seemed happy, thinking about cheating on my girlfriend as if that would make me happy, and flirting with girls who were my friends because I felt like I needed validation. Although I may have felt good for a day or so, I realize now that was harming my relationship with my closest friends and my girlfriend. As I was growing more distant from everyone I just felt so alone. I had a lot of depressive thoughts, I‚Äôd run through scenarios wondering if anyone would text if I didn‚Äôt text first, if anyone would talk to me if I didn‚Äôt approach anyone, and ultimately wondered if anyone would notice if I were gone. I had become to feel like a burden again, just like I did as a kid. I have take  Psychology corses in school and I have thought to myself if I had depression, but I had never taken this seriously. I couldn‚Äôt even imagine trying to have that conversation with my parents. So I continued to pretend to be okay, until the end of high school, which was when Covid 19 came around. My senior year had been a let down, all my friends leaving all the sudden and we didn‚Äôt really get a satisfying send off. I kept in contact with a few of my friends but after a week or so, I only had a handful of friends to talk to and my girlfriend. around this time, I completely shut myself out from others, I unintentionally burnt bridges with old friends, I broke up with my girlfriend really for no reason, and I felt very guilty for that ever since. Sure our relationship wasn‚Äôt perfect, but at the end of the day I would only tell myself justifications for it and try to act like I made the right choice, but I think that I did it mostly because I felt insecure and embarrassed about not being able to express myself emotionally even romantically. I could never bring myself to do normal
things couples did in highschool. I didn‚Äôt want to kiss, didn‚Äôt want introduce her to my friends, and eveytime she asked to have sex, I always refused to, and I am still unsure why I did all of that. Now i was really feeling like there was nobody there for me. Everyone has gone their own paths in life and my parents who have enough to worry about already would be heart broken if I let them know the thoughts and feelings I‚Äôve been having for the last few years. The one thing that I have had to keep my mind off this was my job, where I got to make a couple of connections with coworkers, but I know that they aren‚Äôt really my friends. I know that I‚Äôm trying to fill a void that I had created myself. I am unsure how to reach out to my friends to talk and if it‚Äôs even worth bothering them with something heavy like this, it just doesn‚Äôt seem fair to do that to them. 
Now I just sit here yet again wondering if I really am okay. Why is it that I am making gold money, but I feel like it‚Äôs wrong for me to spend it on myself. I can‚Äôt bring myself to buying things that used to make me happy. It just fills me with guilt, and I end up saving thousands of dollars with no plans on spending it. It makes me think to myself, I have a decent house, with a kind family, good amount of money saved, and I have full potential to pursue my talents and passions, yet I engage in self destructive behaviors that ultimately make me feel terrible. Finding new relationships and putting myself out there is hard right now, especially in a pandemic, and with everyone off at college. Being so literally and emotionally isolated has been just so tolling on me and I‚Äôm not sure I can just get through it all like I always have had to in life. I have been having suicidal thoughts late at night, imagining how people would act when they found out I was really gone, but even that fills me with more guilt. I would feel like I was betraying my parents, who have such high hopes for me and do love me a lot, even if they don‚Äôt say it. I have been trying to pursue old interests I used to love like basketball, music, and language learning but I often get discouraged or loose interest easily and revert to sleeping and watching Korean dramas all day and night. I‚Äôm not really sure what to do next, I always tell myself to get over it and I‚Äôll be fine but now I feel like I should be concerned. 

Sorry for making this so long, I don‚Äôt have anyone in my life to share this with so I know it‚Äôs probably too much for many to care to read.",28Nov2020,1

I can't make any action that isn't necessary without the thought of 'you only do this because you want \_\_\_\_\_\_.'

102,"So I‚Äôve never made a Reddit post and am kind of just like what the hell. To cut to the point, I‚Äôm struggling to figure out if I am depressed or if I‚Äôm just sad due to the whole situation with covid. I‚Äôve struggled with mental health a lot in the past including eating disorders and anxiety but never depression. I am proud to say that I have been able to overcome my eating disorder and have a good handle on my anxiety but this new feeling is something I have never felt. 
I recently moved out to go to college. My roommates are friends before college so it was kind of hard to get to know them, I just realized I had to put more work in to get to know them. But as time has gone on I have felt more and more excluded and it‚Äôs gotten to a point that I stopped trying. It‚Äôs the little things that get to me. I never sit in the front when we go to places. I always have to ask what they are talking about and then, because I know now about an outing, then I‚Äôm invited. there are always inside jokes, they are always talking about people from high school, it‚Äôs just hard. I‚Äôve tried to make other friends but we are online and covid makes it next to impossible to meet people because I have people who are Immunocompromised in my family. I mean, I don‚Äôt really want to get into a lot of detail but I feel really alone. I sit in my room on my computer all day and don‚Äôt talk to anyone. I just feel like I have nothing to do and no one to talk to and I just feel so alone.

I can‚Äôt watch a lecture video for more than 5 minutes without getting distracted. It‚Äôs takes so much effort to get ready, something I used to love doing. I used to love doing my make up and doing my hair and I just get so sick of it half way through now or don‚Äôt even want to start. My boyfriend (who is literally my light right now and the love of my life but we are king distance right now) doesn‚Äôt really know how bad it all is, but still is there for me and tells me that he loves me and cares for me but lately I just don‚Äôt feel it. Like I do believe him but i just don‚Äôt feel it. It is hard to explain bc I do believe him but at the same time I don‚Äôt. For some reason I just feel like I‚Äôm too sad all the time and that I‚Äôm a burden to him and that I need to just be happier around him, but I just can‚Äôt be. The main reason I‚Äôm finally reaching out is that I was in a really rough place a couple nights ago and I dug my nails into my forearm and made two really bad scratches on my arm and it felt really good. I know I didn‚Äôt cut my self but sense then, I‚Äôve done it a couple more time when I‚Äôm just feeling horrible. I‚Äôm scared of it but it also has become a really good coping mechanism all of a sudden. I just don‚Äôt know what to do bc I don‚Äôt won‚Äôt to kill myself! But I kinda just want to disappear.

I have trouble expressing happiness as well, because I guess I'm a coward and too afraid to be rejected. I am tired of repressing my emotions and faking, and I'm tired of never expressing either true happiness or true discomfort. It's always fake happiness, and then my fear gets the better of me when it comes to expressing true happiness.

116,"Hi I'm 17 I was engaged to the most beautiful girl the world but we were long distance. She broke up with me 2 weeks ago because she was falling behind in school and she couldn't handle my mental health issues. I tried to kill myself the day after she ended things and spent a week in a mental health hospital. I realized all the ways I fucked up and all I want is to have her back. Before I met her I cried every day because I didn't know my life purpose. I realized I made the relationship all about me. We were the first kiss and first everything for each other. I write her letters every day now to cope and the only thing keeping me going is hope. I only want to live for her but how do I live and stay strong for someone who barely wants to talk to me. She was my best friend and the only person I could talk to. She is what's motivating me to keep going. People say move on and it's the last thing I want to hear because no one understands how much I love her. It's like she has found a way to block out all emotions. So anyway I want to know how I'm supposed to live when the only person I'm staying alive for doesn't want to be with me anymore. I know if I hurt myself again then I lose any chance at being with her. But right now it hurts so much to be without her. I'm lost because I only want to be alive for her but how do I keep going until she is ready to take me back. I promised her I would always wait for her no matter what. I'm not Christian anymore but when I have dark thoughts and want to kill myself I think maybe if heaven is real I'll be with her there. 

For those of you wondering my mental illnesses are as follows.
Major depressive disorder 
Borderline personality disorder 
Severe anxiety

I got a concussion and whiplash back in June and fell into a deep and intense depression. I was prescribed Escitalopram to help with the depression and after a couple weeks I became very excitable and full of energy (more than my baseline) I felt incredible and like I could own my life and accomplish anything.. and if I didn‚Äôt- I wouldn‚Äôt care. This lasted for about two weeks before I fell into the deepest and most intense depression ever. I always have thought about death and have engaged In self harm up to 3-4 years up to this time. I really wanted to die and end things.. hated every one and felt totally useless.

I spoke with my doctor, who recommended me to ween off the medication, but I quit cold turkey. She also asked if I had ever been assessed for BPD, which I had not. I have had highs and lows, but never to the extent while on Escitalopram. I loved how I felt when I was on my ‚Äúhighs‚Äù but the ‚Äúlows‚Äù were too intense for me.

125,"Hi everyone. 
I've always struggled with depression. It has affected me in various ways and given me only negative consequences and difficult obstacles to overcome. 

Years ago, I experienced a deep depression that I never treated. I isolated myself. I stayed in my room. Gained weight, lost weight, gained weight. I became numb. I developed an unhealthy relationship with my family and it became impossible for me to find the motivation in keeping friendships.

My mom and I are close, but our relationship is toxic. We love each other, but we have hurt each other deeply over and over again. My mom has a drinking problem, alcoholism. She thinks because she doesn't drink morning noon and night, 7 days a week that she doesn't have a drinking problem but she does. When she drinks she can't stop, she becomes a nasty person and it has affected me growing up. I feel horrible about myself.  I have no self esteem. But I am so loyal and kind that I forgive and let it go. I developed horrible anxiety and low self esteem from the abuse. It caused me to be mistrustful of others, I developed lack of motivation and focus, my grades were horrible growing up. I blame myself for school but I realize that the abuse I was given and toxicity I participated in has caused some sort of impairment in my brain. 

So from my depression to my anxiety to my toxic relationship with my mom and family,
I think it has affected my brain. I can't focus.  I can't retain information, moreso I can't recite it. If I see it written down, I will remember but I can't clearly recite anything word for word. It's becoming hard for me to focus on school. I can't stay focused and I become tired when studying. I think this stems from a cognitive impairment in my prefrontal cortex due to my many major depressive episodes and my pmdd. 
I also have been diagnosed with PMDD by my GYN. I am currently on birth control. It has helped a bit, haven't been on it for long. Almost a month. I notice a small improvement. 
I am going to be starting EMT school soon, and then I want to become a paramedic. But I'm fearful that I will get in my own way. 

My long-term goal is to become a nurse. 

I am trying to Google ways that I can reverse this, and exercise my mind and rebuild my cognitive abilities. 

It's so bad that my mom puts me down over it. 

 What should I do? Do you have any experience or advice that you can share with me?",28Nov2020,1

Objectively I have built a good life yet pretty much every night I feel like I just can't wait for everything to be over. Like the thought of death seems to fill me with a false sense of relief.

I feel, even though everything is good it is all pointless. My life is full of all of the things that make for a ""good life"" and yet my night time mind just wants to escape everything.. and it is literally every night and when I first wake up..

Obviously there must be a part of me that doesn't want to accept this ""idea"" or I wouldn't be posting here I guess but I worry it is taking more of a hold..

When it started about a year or so ago I just pushed it back.. then I started arguing and now it's like my mind is starting to agree and I don't know why..

I literally have a good life, I'm pretty happy but nothing seems to have worth.

A couple days ago, I tried to take my own life for the first time since I was a young teen. It came out of nowhere- I was doing okay, just a normal morning, then all of a sudden my mind blanked out and I made a decision I really regret.

I was in hospital overnight, sat through a NAC treatment and had countless conversations with the crisis team about what to do next. When they discharged me, I thought I was getting on the right track and had a vague plan on how I'd get better.

But now that I'm home, I just... I don't know where to start. I'm trying to pick up the pieces and fix the mess that I've made, but it's difficult. I've hurt people I care about by hurting myself. I think I've completely sabotaged my relationship for good, because I acted impulsively rather than reaching out for help.

I know that I need to deal with the consequences of what I've done, and I will, somehow. I'm really trying, but I feel so lost, and so alone right now.

I'm sorry, I just needed somewhere and somehow to get this off my chest, because it's getting so overwhelming.",28Nov2020,1

I guess I just find interactions exhausting, especially since I‚Äôve been told many times that I come off as rude or arrogant. I think this experience helped me realize something though that absolutely terrifies me. I absolutely am TERRIFIED of growing up. The thought of changing horrified me. I‚Äôm now realizing that ive spent so long isolating myself that I can‚Äôt handle anything. The thought of becoming an adult and actually having to join the real world makes me want to disappear. I‚Äôm not suicidal right now or anything like that, but rather the thought of having to deal with this guy is exhausting, and makes me want to hide away in my room forever.

135,"Hello everyone, I'm not sure why I'm writing this but I suppose it's out of desperation. Basically, to explain my situation I'm an English 18-year-old kid going through that phase of turning into an adult and finding a job whilst also tackling a pandemic, see the problem is I've seen doctors in the past and they've told me I have a perfection personality and you would imagine that would help but it doesn't at all. I've never worked before and everywhere I've looked for a job they have emailed me back some lousy computer-generated email saying they have better candidates and I'm guessing it's the lack of experience but how are teenagers suppose to find experience if you can't get a job without experience. Basically, to explain the perfectionist side, I take everything as a competition, not in a way that I'm against anyone but with everything I do I have to be the best. I play games every day and if I'm not the best in the lobby my brain kind of turns against me and tells me to just give up, I cant just enjoy anything. and it's the same with finding a job because I've been rejected so many times my brain has turned against me and basically made me depressed but it's to a max extreme, I start thinking I'm going to be homeless when I'm older and although I know that's a ridiculous statement, my brain can't stop thinking things like that. Don't worry I've tried calling career advisors and tried tidying up my CV and the answer is still no.

    While realizing how much pain and suffering my Mom has to go thru seeing me struggle, trying tirelessly to find a good treatment for me, trying to make the right choice/have boundaries, and so much more, plus the rest of my family has to deal with, I realized that suicide is a liable option. It‚Äôs not just this, it‚Äôs bad on my side too, I constantly think I‚Äôm being monitored and mind being read, this makes me paranoid thinking I‚Äôm on some sort of TV show, blah blah blah. Then people fuck with me about personal stuff that they shouldn‚Äôt know and it makes me reflect on how big of a shit I am. I‚Äôm also an addict, and can‚Äôt get sober because at times (a lot of times) I get I guess ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù where I have thoughts like I described earlier. I know somethings up, I know my slate isn‚Äôt clean and I truly have a poisonous way of thinking....I spin webs when I don‚Äôt even know it. 

     I‚Äôve been to countless treatments and I get better for a little if that and then when I‚Äôm fed up with having to hear people speak in my head and tell me bad shit (not saying I don‚Äôt completely deserve it) I just can‚Äôt function and especially connect with those around me. I am basically either really happy because I‚Äôm high, really anxious because I know some crazy shit is going on, or I‚Äôm depressed and just want to sleep or do nothing. I‚Äôm also a complete narcissist because of this, I think the TV talks to me by giving signs, I think it all revolves around me. This started when I really think things were meant to be for me but now it‚Äôs like EVERYTHING is about me and that‚Äôs no way to only live but to make others live. My mom would still do anything for me to help but I can‚Äôt help myself. 

    Here‚Äôs the main cycle: do good for a little and keep my cool, start expressing myself/talk to people or do something I think others would think is bad, then I hear their voice in my head saying various things like ‚Äúget the fuck out of here‚Äù or the famous ‚Äúgo kill yourself‚Äù. Then I start either getting anxious and want to leave the situation ASAP, or I get angry but have to keep it in because idk if it‚Äôs real or not and even if it is I‚Äôd have to be in a battle constantly, and when I finally get fed up I attempt suicide or fancy the idea. So the scoop, Im a piece of shit who is a narcissist and druggie who takes my bullshit out on others. It could be much worse, but still, it‚Äôs progressively getting worse and I feel more need to take action when I‚Äôm angry (well kinda, I freaked out a little in detox a week ago) and I damn sure don‚Äôt want to hurt an innocent person and I really don‚Äôt want to hurt someone even if they‚Äôre real because they probably are either spot on (which I usually can‚Äôt reconcile) or they just don‚Äôt understand my whole situation. Eh, I have some decent traits, but for the most part I honestly suck at life. With all that being said, you can‚Äôt tell me that suicide is not a liable option!!!??? I hurt people more than I love, basically what my loved ones say And they‚Äôre right. Idk, you ever just feel like a cancer to the world and those who care about you? Because I feel that, and it‚Äôs a terrible feeling to think you‚Äôre alive yet ruining your existence by ruining others existence. 

   My mom has to go thru therapy and psychiatrist, she‚Äôs had to pay a lot to get me into rehab, she‚Äôs spent hours getting me into top rehabs, she‚Äôs done all that she can do. I try to help myself from her helping me but I legit just can‚Äôt face reality even though I‚Äôm not entirely sure what that is (as y‚Äôall know, well possibly I guess). Two realities seem to be clashing together and I‚Äôm confused, angry, fearful, and just down in the dumps because the news has been broken.....I‚Äôm a fucked up idiot who‚Äôs mind is being read or at least something is CLEARLY going on behind scenes....which I did provoke btw if you can figure out how lol (it‚Äôs really not funny). Well I guess if you never see me on here again I‚Äôll be gone, wish you guys the best of luck, don‚Äôt end up like me and get yourself too far down the rabbit hole. Ya, I can live, but it‚Äôs the same shit and I‚Äôm sick of disappointing my family and myself. Feeling like a fuck up all the time isn‚Äôt fun, no matter how well I act, I know you probably don‚Äôt like me.....and I hate that it‚Äôs true but it eats me alive to know a lot of people don‚Äôt like me.

It‚Äôs just hard to think ‚Äúwell what If my family does want me to live and the voices are lying‚Äù and it‚Äôs hard to think of my niece, what would she think of me suddenly disappearing?

149,"So I have this issue which I've had for awhile, basically I will get these like ""episodes"" of where I feel like nothing real and I don't feel like a person or like I'm not actually in my own body. It's kinda like watching a movie, sometimes. It happens fairly frequently in my opinion, although I can't think of the last time it happened. It's never really bugged me and I tend to just ignore it and continue doing whatever I'm doing. It normally happens during like social situations, especially in large groups or groups where I don't know a lot of people.

Guys...im fucking tired.

Is anybody else THAT friend? The one people call in the night to talk to because you actually support and listen. The friend\SO thats constantly goes put of their way to help their close people or partner get through things both large and small? The always shoulder to cry on for most of your friends? The only one willing to pick up shitfaced idiot friends monday night, last second drug deals (weed, relax.), or even stop by friends houses having panic attacks so they can go for a drive with me to listen to music and calm them down...etc?

Well...why dont i get one of those? I feel like i constantly do my best to be my best for the people i value, and it just seems that when i seem to need it most that nobody will listen. 

My girlfriends home situation is toxic and her cutting and other mental health problems are flaring up like crazy, most of my friends are either unemployed, depressed, or both. Im blessed with work, but my hours are crazy and make it hard to have a real social life (graveyard shift). 

None of thats even mentioning political shit, climate shit, religious shit, and all the other monumental heaps of unjust bullshit that constantly happen around me and wear down my mental state. Every time i open the news i just want to crawl in a hole with my games and books like a fucking hobbit. 

Im a 24M, and im sick of everyone around me assuming that im always dandy just because i can actually put an ounce of effort for someone else since im a relatively healthy, somewhat getting by, male. Almost all of my friends short of select few seem to need me more than i really need them...

I dont want to sound like woe is me. Im aware im blessed. I have people that love me and people worth loving, enough friends to be satisfied, fairly steady income. Most of the problems i see on here and other similar subs outweigh my petty shit that it often makes me feel guilty for feeling bad in the first place...

I read something recently posted about how men are often told to suck it up about their feelings, and it helped validate my struggle a little at least.

a few years ago i began hearing voices and hallucinating fairly frequantly but kept it to myself as i didnt want to worry anyone, of course this didnt do me any good since i just became more and more paranoid and more and more hopeless the longer i dragged out my little secret.

in Octoberish (Not sure on the date) i experienced one of the worst panic attacks i have felt, in the long short, i was hallucinating like no tommorow and i genuinly felt as if i wasnt real myself or anything around me was real, scary af.

After a series of phonecall meetings (Thanks Covid) I was refered to the EI team.


Whilst this would be good, ive done it before.
I mean ive told the appropriate people (I think CAMHS is how you spell it) what was happening and they just labled my Autism as a cause and sent me on my way, Stuff only got worse from there.

Being seen by for the first time now and im hoping they can shed some light on other causes since i have a firm belief my Autism is not the cause, but i have a strong feeling this will just be another failed attempt at trying to explain what happens within my damaged fcking brain.

If it helps you to understand my situation a bit more, then heres what ive experienced so far:



Hallucinations (Audible, Visual and some Sensory which in my case was smell)




Delusions (I once went onto school with the belief i was immortal and could get away with anything, other details are pretty blurry but i faintly remember wanting to attack a few known bullies on a Vigilanty type thing, dont really know why i felt the need but i wasnt exactly in the best mindset obviously so who knows)




Dont really know what the term is (if there even is one) but theres extended periods of time where ill feel like everyone is against me or trying to take advantage of me so ill avoid certain people and sometimes even refuse to have contact with my friend group from days to on one point a few months at a time, i know they care about me so im so fcking confused to why my brain makes me have these feelings of imminent betrayel.



TL; DR: I have multiple problems with my head and its starting to affect me more than ever and i have no idea what to do or say from here

159,"Hey, I am a 19-year-old gay male and suffering from depression for most of my life. Have been on a road to recovery for a while after I hit my lowest point, I am taking antidepressants and other medication and haven't felt better.

As you can see, my first post is on r/cofessions a year back. It was the last time I attempted suicide and a single accidental phone call saved my life that day. Have been clean for over a year now but almost came to attempting the same plan again. It has been tough fighting it and I wish that everyone can find the spark to keep going.

The reason for my depression comes from a lot of childhood pressure, neglect of love, substance abuse in the family. The pressure I am under to perform is major. I am the only one in my family's younger generation (the oldest of my cousins is around 30) that has gotten a full highschool education (in a decent school) and started university. To say the least, the bar was not high. 

The best way I can put it: I have a lot of freedom and no other responsibilities to attend to but to get my education and have a better life but I am still not able to perform to that level as my coping mechanisms from all these years was to distract myself (youtube, movies, Reddit, imagination, etc...) and this is hurting me and my future. I procrastinate to the level that even my medication can't deal with the small panic/anxiety attacks from overthinking these things.

Before I started medication in the year following my last attempt, I tried planning my time, the 20/80 rule, building habits, and more. I often distance myself from other people as I am an introvert who has learned tricks to pass as an energetic extrovert but even after the medication I find myself distancing and doing that even more.

What can I do to fix that(my inability to do meaningful work and distancing)? How do I stop procrastinating and/or distracting myself from the reality of life? What should be the first step? What has worked for you?",28Nov2020,1

166,"Location: Georgia, USA

We are concerned for my aunt. She seems to be spiraling into severe mental illness but refuses to go to a doctor. She hasn't bathed or changed clothes in three years (the clothes have not been washed in this time). Her house is a classic hoarder-house, full of garbage with little pathways to each room. The only place she goes is to the cemetery every day to visit her father's grave (he died 3 years ago and she has visited every single day since then, sometimes multiple times a day, sometimes staying for hours).

When we try and confront her with our concerns, she says there's no problem and has no reason to see a doctor. She really spiraled quickly after her father died so I think this is mostly grief related.

he has struggled with depression since before i met him, and it‚Äôs gotten better in the past year we‚Äôve been dating. I‚Äôve always done my best to support him because he deserves patience, love, and consistency. 

the last couple of months, though, external factors in life have contributed and he seems to be going through a more major episode than i‚Äôve seen since i‚Äôve been with him. needless to say, i‚Äôm worried about him. i‚Äôve been exhausting my resources to try and figure out how to support him (not fix him or take on his emotions- i know that‚Äôs not my job. he has a therapist as of recently. i just want to be a source of support). 

i‚Äôm recovering from a mental illness myself where my nervous system is dis regulated, so things have been hard for me on an individual level, and i understand what he‚Äôs working through. through therapy and heavy, heavy introspection, i‚Äôm working hard to become a better person and partner. 

the inconsistency is starting to take a toll on me, though. most days are good, but then there are some (more so recently) overrun by numbness and recently we had a long talk to make sure we covered all possible bases and examined if i (or the relationship) was the problem, because i just want him to feel secure and healthy. it‚Äôs been hard for me to go from one day of contentment and planning for our future (we‚Äôre in a heavily transitionary period in life right now) and the next of uncertainty. i want to make sure he figures everything out, and knows what choices are best for him. this conflict is probably what‚Äôs impacting me most. i know this happens in relationships, and i am sure i only want to be with him. the rate of the cycling right now is what‚Äôs hard, because i know numbness is taking him over.

177,"I'm currently going through the diagnostic process trying to get my mental health in order.

For years, I've had trouble getting motivated to work and focusing on my work. To self-medicate, I drunk a ton of coffee. Which worked for many years until I developed an anxiety disorder as a result of that and post-surgery stomach problems, which the coffee clearly wasn't helping with either.

In addition to the anxiety, I periodically get very down. This tends to happen on weekends when I'm not distracted by the constant activity of work. I used alcohol to keep that feeling at bay until, again for health reasons, that stopped being a viable option.

My initial diagnosis was ADHD with probable secondary anxiety/depression. I've started taking Ritalin and the effect is super-weird: I get all the focus and willpower that I needed from coffee but none of the mood lift which I've become accustomed to. Hence, my depression is now as untreated as it's ever been and probably at its worst.

My gut feeling (and I think what my psychiatrist was unsure about) was that I might just have plain 'ol depression. And the trouble focusing and difficulty getting working were all flowing than that. Thus, I think the ADHD diagnosis might have been a misdiagnosis. Or that I have primary depression and secondary ADHD or depression and ADHD, which can be comorbid.

I'm not asking for a diagnosis of course (have my psychiatrist for that thankfully), but would love to know whether anybody gone through this process, struggling to figure out whether your trouble focusing is from ADHD or depression? And if so, how did you and your medical team make that determination in the end?",28Nov2020,1
178,"We go through our world, so used to making the same choices again and again, that it becomes very difficult to change things when we‚Äôre unhappy. But if we train ourselves to stop regularly, to be present and consciously make good choices rather than being on autopilot we can transform our suffering. 

A bit of regular practice like a guided meditation is important - but you can also stop for a moment a few times through the day,  notice your breath, become aware of what you can feel in your body, what you‚Äôre thinking and feeling. Training yourself in this way helps to raise awareness of the choices we have.

In mindfulness we call the decisions we make ‚Äòwatering the seeds‚Äô. These everyday choices can contribute to our anger, our happiness, our fear - just in the same way that if you choose to water certain plants in your garden, you‚Äôre choosing what your future garden looks like. Being aware of decisions and prioritising your wellbeing as the most important factor makes a huge difference over time. Peace in oneself, peace in the world.

179,"I‚Äôm Mason and I‚Äôm a 17 year old bro living in Michigan.

Some background: I‚Äôm Jamaican and African American, two groups known for not believing or dealing with mental illnesses.

I think I‚Äôm pretty normal I guess. I have friends, a girlfriend of 3 months, I‚Äôm on the swim team at my school, I make good grades minus the C I made in history this year.

I lost my daddy two years the week before Thanksgiving. At the time I didn‚Äôt think that so much would change. I have twin older siblings, boy/girl 20. They were already out of the house when our daddy died. Also my mother refuses to get rid of the couch my daddy died on. It‚Äôs still in our living room with the same smushed cushions and blankets from that day. It‚Äôs like a constant reminder ya know.

I get along okay with my mother I guess. We don‚Äôt talk or anything really. Both of my parents were military and my mother runs her house like a drill instructor. There‚Äôs no sleeping in. You get up and get your day started. No lounging in your bedroom. I‚Äôve been able to hang in my room more since distance learning. It sucks. I can‚Äôt go out and get a job because of my parents‚Äô rule of ‚Äúschool is your job‚Äù.

Also my daddy was big into stocks and generational wealth so when he died he left my siblings and I close to $80K a piece which my mother brings up when I ask to get a job. The kicker is that I don‚Äôt have access to it and she has to approve all of my purchases. And I do mean all. I had to get approval to order a $5 shower speaker. Had to explain why I wanted to waste my money on it.

College is a big stress thing for me right now. I‚Äôm in my senior year of HS. I‚Äôve narrowed my choices down to Kansas, Mizzou, Duke, Ohio State, and University of Illinois. My mother straight up ignores me or disregards my choices except for Ohio State. She can‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm looking at schools so far away from my ‚Äúsupport system‚Äù. My siblings fled Michigan for college too so I don‚Äôt know what support system she‚Äôs talking about. 

I often find myself angrily confronting God for taking the wrong parent from me and my siblings. My daddy used to call me ‚ÄúBig Dawg‚Äù and now I‚Äôm no ones ‚Äúbig dawg‚Äù. Wow I sound like a baby. The only good part of my dad dying was that his dad came to live with us and it‚Äôs been great having him around. He‚Äôs able to get my mother to back down on some rules so that‚Äôs cool.

I‚Äôve wasted enough of you good people‚Äôs time.

I‚Äôll make this brief: I feel sad a lot, no appetite, no energy to swim. Embarrassingly my hygiene isn‚Äôt as pristine as it once was. I don‚Äôt turn 18 until February but I don‚Äôt know if I can keep this up until then. Is this what being a teenager is supposed to be? Am I being a little brat? Can I go see a psychiatrist without a parent or guardian?

I think about how my mom is emotionally abusive towards me and I'm just worried that I deserve it for being a fucking brat all the time. 

I'm a crybaby about everything and when someone tells me im over reacting I act like a shitty 4 year old who didn't get what they wanted in the toy store by yelling at them to shut up while I keep crying. 

And to top it all off im never friendly towards people, I just sit there quietly and ignore them. And when I am friendly I end up saying weird things and then they don't want to talk to me anymore. 

I don't know why I'm alive anymore. I fail at everything I do and I'm always being awful to everyone and then I try to justify it when there's no point. I don't know why I'm fucking alive if I don't contribute anything to society. I wish I was dead. If I was dead someone else could be playing Apex and getting wins. If I was dead someone else could be on the bowling team abd actually do well. If I was dead someone wouldn't have to deal with me when I'm upset or be weirded out when I act stupid. And my mom wouldn't have to deal with her stupid bratty daughter. 

I wish I could just kill myself but that would only make my family more stressed out and I've already been a burden in the first place. I wanna disappear without a trace but I can't and I don't know what to do.

But if I tell anyone about this they'll just treat me like a spoiled brat.",28Nov2020,1
181,"Every time I'm upset or stressed out all that I get is either being called an overdramatic crybaby or I'm yelled at. The last time I cried in front of someone I got smacked across the face 5 times by my mother and she didn't apologise until she realised she bruised my face. 

I just want to be held. I want to feel warm and safe and cared about. I want someone to love me and tell me I'm ok and I want them to hold me and hug me and kiss my forehead and lay with me and make me feel better instead of insulting me and hurting me. 

I dont understand what I did to deserve this. I just want to be held. Why is that so much to ask for??",28Nov2020,1
182,"I am a clumsy person who stumbles around things and I get scratches or burns over my body. Yet, those wounds seem to heal eventually in 2-3 weeks. Even some still mark but it doesnt hurt or its too small to notice. Actually it doesnt bother me anymore. Yet, going through a break up now seem so painful and I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel. My brain is stressing over it and it keeps hurting. 

How do I get to the point of peace that this wound will heal too and I will be just fine too mentally and emotionally?

I've been watching all these videos about the universe and shit. And I've dived pretty deep into astronomy and physics.

And if cannot understand or grasp things that are meant to be ""normal"". 

I can't sleep. I can't deal with people. 

My anxiety is through the roof. I sit in my room all day. I drink constantly but not to get drunk just to take the edge of existence off. 

I'm good at pretending things are ok when I need to talk to people. Everyone thinks I'm great. But I'm just a good actor.

192," What is it that moves us towards wanting to be healthy? And what does healthy even mean for trauma survivors? It‚Äôs almost a trick question. On the one hand, we have society telling us this idea of health is not to feel the emotional impact of the world around us. On the other hand, we tell ourselves that feeling emotions are destructive, in some shape or the other. We tell ourselves that we shouldn‚Äôt be angry, happy, sad, or anything in between due to other people‚Äôs responses, which in its own right is a fallacy. The entire thought of removing ourselves from emotion is nonsense, and if you are anything like me, you understand what it‚Äôs like to be or become dissociated. And yet society says don‚Äôt get too happy unless it‚Äôs over that new car you can‚Äôt afford and don‚Äôt get too sad unless it‚Äôs over that huge medical procedure that your insurance isn‚Äôt going to cover. I suspect that the longer we hide from our emotional capacity, the worse off we all are. 

I learned, like many, to suppress my emotions at all cost, not only due to the potential of rejection but also because becoming robotic became a defense mechanism for safety. But how does that help us now as adults? How does our ability to turn off create anything sustainable in our lives? I don‚Äôt think that you can truly live if you are not allotting yourself the space to be a human being. Yet, we are faced with this conflicting message - be more emotional but not too much because you might interrupt the status quo. To feel is human. To exist in whatever state we dare step into is our right as a living organism that just so happens to be lucky enough to have a brain that developed the ability to do so. And we run from that. 

I don‚Äôt know that there will be an easy solution for creating a change in society around human emotion because we are scared of that side of us. We are terrified of conflict and the idea that it won‚Äôt always *be ok*. And that‚Äôs fine by me. I recognize that this is a huge blanket statement as a whole and that some people, trauma survivors included, may not fall into this boat, but that feels like the minority. I hope that we can change together; this is an internal power struggle that we face independently while also facing it collectively, and it‚Äôs kind of a clusterfuck. 

What would it be like to be able to feel the full range of who we are? I think it would be beautiful and scary and everything in between. But at least we would be in it, not hiding from the fact that boys cry and girls get angry and successful people are miserable, and some people just need to be heard. We fear the repercussions of being seen because we have learned experiences that point to the idea that we should be afraid to be us, and we come by that honestly. 

As a man who didn‚Äôt cry for fifteen years, I have felt what it feels like to become human again. It was a painful process of growth, self-reflection, and learning to be vulnerable with myself. In that journey, I also learned that it‚Äôs OK to be angry, sad, proud, and hopeful - none of these emotions were previously a healthy understanding for me. Today, as I reflect on moments of crying over Addidas ads, feeling a rush of energy during romcoms, and the general sense of aliveness that comes when connected with other human beings, I can‚Äôt help but be grateful for knowing the other side. 

I wish I could take my feelings of wanting everyone to be safe within their emotions and sprinkle it on the world. I guess in some ways I do as I write this, but that thing inside of us that is scared to be seen just needs to be nurtured and given a little space to be safe. I challenge you to find that for yourself and experience the fullness of the light, the dark, and the gray.

Until next time my friend‚Ä¶

193,"I've been procrastinating a lot since I gained this what you call this thing called memory recall from cleaning the room, washing the dishes, studying math on high school, coding while in college and today. I tried pomodoro technique it's effective in someway if it's coupled with deadlines and imminent failure. I have trouble sticking to my goals like for example learning to code I've been putting it off for 2 weeks. I tried this self help app to deal with anxiety and I put it on hold since August. tried to start journal my last entry was this September. I felt so lost of control on my life today akin like floating in a endless void or ocean of misery. I missed a lot of opportunities in life and tried many things to deal with it, this dopamine detox, journalling, I even tried online counselling, I have yet to get appointment (this time it's both overwhelmed at the task and money concerns) but I couldn't follow through on what I've started. 

Also this is now is affecting my work, I think my boss is noticing I couldn't follow thru task given at hand. Sometimes I wanna do something but I get the feeling of lazy overwhelmed and scared anxious. I hated followup emails and the likes sending that dreaded email takes a lot of willpower on my end.

I think I chickened out most part of my life. Things are piling up and my life is just wasting away I'm in my in 2
30s. I felt so miserable at myself knowing my peers/friends same as my age are doing great and excelling, peers younger than me are exceeding what my little accomplishment I have. I just don't know how to do this life thing. I felt like a child who got lost in a mall after spending time at toy's r us while my parents are calling the cops or something.

I'm losing patience on myself, and depression (yet to be confirmed by an appointment to a psychologist, but had a survey with the hr - results came in and it's severe, same with my anxiety) is taking a hold of my psyche.

Also I noticed my humor has taken a deep dive to a darker nihilistic despair kind, had seen past post on fb me enjoy and laughing at simple things like slapstick kind of humor. ah I miss the simple days. I also felt disconnected to my religion (another post on that somewhere in reddit). Also struggled with sleeping, many factors that messed up with this, stress, overthinking, anxiety, noisy neighbors who start early in the morning, me addicted to netflix, socmed, memes, and sometimes games. 

Thank you for taking time to read such long list of failures. Hope you had a nice laugh at cat memes after this post just to brush off the negativity you have read.",28Nov2020,1
194,"I‚Äôm not sure if this sub would be the most fitting for this kind of question but any advice would be cool. 

But basically sharing any kind of food, drink, or utensil has become absolutely disgusting and repulsing for me. It started 3 years ago(long story short i accidentally drank a bottle full of cloudy water with weird flakes that someone used for spitting in?) but it‚Äôs only gotten a lot worse. When it started I just wouldnt be able to share drinks. Now if someone asks for a share of food too i cant help but feel extremely disgusted by it. I also can‚Äôt stand messing with peoples utensils. If someone uses their utensil to pick up some of my food, or suggests that i use their utensil, thats also quite gross to me. It‚Äôs gotten to a weird point where I dont even want to get close to my *own* food without washing/cleaning my face properly(even if it isnt dirty)because as gross as this sounds i feel like my skin would fall into it. 

Back to the sharing foods and drinks thing, I know other people arent dirty like that but the thought of all that bacteria and sharing of germs makes me agitated. And some people dont get the memo when I dont want to share so when I am forced to share i want to rip my hair out. It makes me genuinely angry and i start to feel overwhelmed and just want to punch something. I‚Äôm not sure if this kind of thing is normal or what but even my family complains about my behavior.

195,"Hello, internet. I think there‚Äôs probably a lot of context and history that would help me explain myself a bit better, but for the sake of brevity, I‚Äôve got trauma induced OCD. There‚Äôs a long, complicated history of abuse and neglect, physically and emotionally in my past. I lost the fitness studio I owned back in June due to this pandemic, and while I‚Äôve dealt with anxiety and depression in the past - these last few months have been my darkest. Almost daily panic attacks. Some I can deal with, and others take me down for the day. 

I‚Äôve always had a bad habit of picking at my skin. I had an abusive boyfriend who would hold me down and squeeze any blemishes or blackheads or pores on my face to the point of pain - he was much stronger than I was so one day I just stopped fighting it and it became another layer of toxicity in that relationship. The relationship ended but I took the habit with me. I was with him from 15-19 so it was a pretty formative time for me. I started to pick my own face in a way that I can see now was almost a form of self regulation, or punishment? Very hard to explain what compelled me, but it stuck with me. 
I‚Äôm 32 now, and while it‚Äôs always been a ‚Äúbad habit‚Äù I find that I‚Äôm almost not able to control the urge. Not even almost, I can‚Äôt. Multiple times a day, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm ‚Äúcoming to‚Äù while I‚Äôm doing it, realizing that I‚Äôm drawing blood and my entire face is red and burning from me trying to draw out every imperfection. What would be maybe 2-3 minutes in the past has recently been 20-30 minutes before I can stop. Lately I‚Äôve been using tweezers, and the damage isn‚Äôt going away. My skin looks unhealthy..and if I‚Äôm being honest, it‚Äôs not normal acne or dry skin blemishes...these are self inflicted and it looks like it. I‚Äôve got 20+ spots that I‚Äôve drawn blood from at the moment. I‚Äôm a pretty self aware person..therapy has helped. I know this is an issue but I‚Äôm starting to like I can‚Äôt control it. It makes my boyfriend sad, I think because I‚Äôm gouging holes in my face daily, and my shoulders too. I also feel like he questions my mental stability, because I‚Äôm not able stop and he has a hard time understanding why. 

Does anyone have any advice on stopping? This feels like it‚Äôs gone past the point of bad habit.",28Nov2020,1
196,"Hi! First thing first, I'm not self diagnosing - I'm only asking questions and sharing concerns based off things I've already discussed with professionals (but I don't have any appointments coming up, so I thought I'd ask here. Yes I'm aware I could be fed false information. Just looking for answers.)

Okay, so my focus is horrible. Memory - horrible. I'm spacey all the time and trying to focus NEVER lasts. Its kind of defeating sometimes but it's ok. 
I am diagnosed with MDD (depression) and I agree I have chronic lower moods, but honestly my mood has been pretty fantastic lately and the focus and all is still the same. I think, actually, hyperness is getting worse as my mood grows, but as I said, I'm still JUST as spacey.

I've brought up focus to psychiatrists multiple times. I've been screened multiple times. I do not show hyperactivity and its fucking me over, but oh my goodness???? I'm SO UNFOCUSED and SO SPACEY. Memory too is really bad.
Anyway I've heard that its a tough diagnosis bc meds and all. I've heard it could be from my depression or anxiety, which makes sense, but also doesn't make sense to me, because I'm not anxious much at all anymore, and my mood is pretty good nowadays. 

Could someone give me insight? The reason I would want the diagnosis is so I can have an explanation. I'm not telling people ""depression or anxiety"" if they ask why I'm just soooo spacey. It wouldn't make sense, plus I don't appreciate the stigma. Medicine would also be amazing if it'd give me that boost, because I'm doing pretty bad in school too.

I did 2 years of community, but can't afford to go on. I'm struggling. I have a severe fear of being poor for the rest of my life. I've struggled with addiction. I fear my younger siblings will turn to drugs and alcohol like I did.

I text my mother ""Everyone ok?"" about 15 times a day (I no longer live there). I'm constantly in fear that the house burned down, or one of the kids fell and broke their arm. I worry 24/7.

Although I dont want to be male, I still have issues accepting my body. Sometimes, out of the blue, I'll be reminded of my body and have these really intense feelings of guilt and shame. It makes me feel sick, but the attacks only come in short bursts. As soon as I want to cry, the feeling is gone. However the discomfort lasts quite a while, sometimes a few hours.

The closest term I would describe it as is body dysphoria, since I'm unhappy in my own skin, though this term is usually used along with body dysmorphia, which is what trans people go through before they transition. 
Im not looking for a diagnosis, I only want to be able to educate myself more about what I'm going through (If these attacks get worse or dont go away, I will try to schedule a therapist appointment).

So i keep on pushing him away. My boyfriend being the most kind and patient person listens to me and tries to understand me.

At this point with my family it‚Äôs so bad that I wince away. I cant even describe the feeling, it‚Äôs like nausea almost. I know that sounds awful and the worst part is that they‚Äôve done nothing to deserve it. I have a generally very healthy relationship with all of my family despite the fact that there‚Äôs quite a lot of drama.

The only thing I can think is that when my friends hug me or a stranger shakes my hand, it‚Äôs somehow less intensely affectionate. Like there‚Äôs less meaning behind it maybe, so it doesn‚Äôt feel as intense to me. But I mean any physical contact from my family, like a hand on my shoulder or anything, I can‚Äôt do it. I freeze up at best.

My immediate family knows that physical affection is uncomfortable for me in general and so don‚Äôt initiate anything, and don‚Äôt have a problem with it. But my grandma in particular is going to cause a bad reaction from me if she carries on. Aside from my physical reaction to it, I and my mum have told her multiple times that it‚Äôs not personal but I don‚Äôt like to be touched. She carries on anyway.

I‚Äôm very claustrophobic (including about weird things, like sometimes I almost can‚Äôt breathe because I‚Äôll be stood in public and realise that I can‚Äôt separate all my toes inside my shoes?

207,"Ugh, I don‚Äôt know. Before the pandemic, I was fine. Was constantly going to parties and seeing friends, was happy and sociable.

Then the pandemic started in the US and we literally didn‚Äôt leave the house, didn‚Äôt even crack a window open, for 3 months straight for fear of the airborne virus getting in.

During all this time, the only thing to do was watch tv and the news was full of violent, doom and gloom images from the constant coronavirus numbers to all the destruction from the ongoing riots. Seems you can‚Äôt trust anyone anymore, even random cars are running over people.

When I open Netflix, it‚Äôs more of the same. Probably 60% of the titles, whether it‚Äôs drama, comedy or action have some sort of implication of death or evil in the title. Tried to watch some tv series to pass the time. One of the was ‚ÄúThe 100,‚Äù which kept popping up on the screen. Terrible mistake. Constant gore throughout and I‚Äôm paranoid about the effects of gory images on a person. Pretty frustrating most of the media, more so the American media, loves to put these sort of things out for consumption. 

Then, there‚Äôs some tv shows about living in a virtual reality which is really getting to me now. Am I living in a dream or virtual reality. Lol, it‚Äôs not just me...there was a news article that came out in ‚ÄúScientific American‚Äù saying that there‚Äôs a 50-50 chance we‚Äôre living in a simulation.

So anyway...maybe it‚Äôs the constant fear of dying, but more so during this past few months, I have the fear that what if something happened to me and the life I‚Äôm living right now is a dream while I‚Äôm in a coma or the afterlife.

When I‚Äôm walking across the street and a car goes past me, I wonder if I got hit. There was one time, I went outside during the early days of the pandemic where I was wearing glasses, a face mask and face shield and my glasses and shield started fogging up and I could barely see anything. Someone was approaching me down the street, and at that time, I thought it was safer to cross the street to avoid coming into contact with people coming towards you, so I started crossing the street without really having a clear view of anything, while still seeing a little sliver through the shield. I‚Äôm still paranoid that maybe I got hit by a car that day from crossing the street without seeing anything and that I‚Äôm in a coma or the afterlife now. 

Doesn‚Äôt really make that much sense, tbh, because this was a residential neighborhood that had relatively few cars going by. Though, I do know some
people who have been struck by cars in this area before (they survived), have seen on the news and the Citizen app reports of hit and runs in the area resulting in deaths and news and Twitter videos of cars hitting people.

More recently, I‚Äôm afraid of choking on something, particularly frozen food. I bought some Popeyes fries the other day and froze them to eat them another day and started eating a frozen fry but chewed pretty thorough but then get paranoid that I swallowed the frozen fry and choked. Same with a frozen peanut m&amp;m.

Lol, probably sounds ridiculous, but I don‚Äôt know, the world just feels unreal right now and I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm just dreaming it all up.

I never seriously considered myself having OCD before because I never really did any rituals to a large extent, but now I think I have full blown OCD. Like, I have constant need to do everything 4 times, to avoid the number 3...cause 3 is the number of family members in my family and in order to keep us safe, I need to skip past the number 3. 

Lol uggh, being alone and not socializing outside of the house is not fun!!",28Nov2020,1
208,"Hello, 

I made this throwaway account, because I don't want to be linked to what I am experiencing.   
For some time I have been experiencing these thoughts that creep me out. I.e. thoughts about r\*pe, inc\*st, s\*cde and things like that. These thoughts always left me feeling off I guess, but I knew that everyone experiences some sort of intrusisve thoughts at times. I am also currently trying to managed to get tested if I have ADHD or ADD, since a lot of other things I do in my day to day life fit in that scheme. 

However today I had this thoughts that kept popping up in my head. I kept thinking about how I would go to m\*rd\*r someone. I was close to writing down something, like a list of bullets points. The only reason I didn't is because I am having problems with my laptop and the programm I use to write. I know that I would never go through with the things I thoiught/think about, but the fact that I was going to write down a plan of how to get someone k\*lled leaves feeling not save in my own body. 

I am nearly crying right now, but I don't want to talk about someone (at least outside of the anonymity that teh internet provides) about this. I am so confused and don't knwo what to do. 

Another thing: I have been seeing a therapist albeit for different reason for the past 5 months.

209,"Once again I‚Äôve (M53) run out of antidepressants and my GP has told me that I‚Äôm just going to have to weather the storm until the withdrawal effects go away. 

It‚Äôs already three days since I took the last dose and  I just can‚Äôt stop doing risky and stupid things... drinking till I crash out, popping codeine painkillers, not eating for 48h. I couldn‚Äôt sleep Wednesday and on Thursday I woke up again around midnight ( less than 1h sleep).. I was feeling so empty, suicidal but strangely  energetic that I grabbed my car keys  and went for a drive.  I drive into an empty supermarket petrol station to top up the tank ( no idea why I did this because it wasn‚Äôt near empty),  and then I just drove without even keying in a destination on the gps... i wasn‚Äôt even watching the time. I end ¬¥Ed up on the A1 motorway that heads from Paris towards Belgium.. no idea how I got there. I couldn‚Äôt remember anything, I was dissociating again.  No one about.. just a few trucks on the inside  lane. I just pressed the accelerator and...

... I‚Äôve no idea how far I‚Äôd travelled by the time I glance at the dials again. I wasn‚Äôt even checking my speed... It was strangely hypnotic to stare straight ahead with the only sounds being the wind whistling past and the whine of the turbocharger. I couldn‚Äôt feel anything even though my heads were gripping the steering wheel and my foot was pressing down on the accelerator pedal.. 210, 220, 230 km/h the turbo boost gauge going up  and  up. It didn‚Äôt register. I just kept on going. At one point I must‚Äôve reached 245-250 because a warning bip came on indicating I was near the top of the revs. 
It felt just like I‚Äôm in one of those Star Wars fighters when they jump into light speed or whatever. I let go of the steering  wheel, pressed down hard on the pedal and closed my eyes... .. I just wanted to drift away on a wave of pure adrenaline.  Then nothing... Nothing happened... no loud bang/ screeching metal etc. 

I opened my eyes... something strange had happened.. or rather nothing had happened. That was it. Maybe I was dead but it was just  my brain‚Äôs way of telling me that I was now in another reality.  I didn‚Äôt register anything. I just eased off the pedal and slowly cruised back to reality. A few kilometres later I pulled off onto a motorway service area., parked near the trucks, and let the turbo cool down. I must‚Äôve drifted off to sleep because when I woke up it was nearly  dawn and the engine was still turning... 

I discovered later in the car onboard log  that I‚Äôd hit 262 km/h and I‚Äôve no idea why the car didn‚Äôt just swerve off the motorway when I let go... 
i was so calm and weirdly un afraid when I had  let go and closed my eyes. Afterwards I wasn‚Äôt sad I hadn‚Äôt managed to kill myself.. I was relieved I hadn‚Äôt crashed into anybody else taking them with me. That‚Äôs why I suppose I chose a long deserted stretch of motorway. I suppose I was lucky there were no police or speed cameras otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt be writing this now.

The experience had emptied me of all the suicidal thoughts. In fact i couldn‚Äôt feel anything.. just peace and a strange calmness. II wasn‚Äôt hungry or thirsty just zen and like I‚Äôd just been meditating. Just a contented nothingness. 

I still managed to get to work. I didn‚Äôt have any flashbacks during the day. I even talked to some of my colleagues.  

I‚Äôve no explanation about what happened, or what didn‚Äôt happen.",28Nov2020,1

211,"Ive always struggled poorly with my mental health. Ive always known something was wrong or just not right. But as a kid you cant really go get help for these issues without parental consent. Whenever I use to bring it up Id get made to feel awful and told that I was normal. 

Last year when I was 18 I moved out to live up at my uni and suffered a major depressive episode since I wasnt having to pretend I was okay anymore. And now Im 19 and going out and getting meds and therapy and shit. My mum just makes it all about her and how awful Im making her feel talking about it and how much she cant stop saying things that hurt me because 'Its just who I am' 

It hurts so fucking badly. Im sat here trying to discover who I am, to discover how to be okay, so I dont have to pretend anymore. I just got off the phone to her and she makes me feel awful because I want to be where I am; its helping me overall feel better mentally, I can be up as late as I want, if I feel like shit I can go and do something about it. 

But when Im there with her, I need to be up at this time, asleep at this time, cant be on my computer for more than 2 hours a day, cant make loud noise, cant have a walk whenever I need one. I get so restricted and so constrained it hurts me more than I otherwise wouldve been, and whenever I try to fight against it Im made out to be the bad person",28Nov2020,1
212,"I'm (21m) living in a house with two of my friends, one of their bfs, a roommate of theirs, another friend, and my ex for a total of 7 people in the house. My ex (21f) and I broke up peacefully a while ago due to me losing my mind and ghosting her for long periods over the summer when we were in quarantine (i have BPD and the isolation was hard to deal with). I'm trying to get over her but it's so hard even thought it's been so long at this point. I just miss her so much and the fact that shes right there makes it so much harder to deal with. I didnt even want to date her when we first started but obviously now it's different. 

I sent her a looong message talking about BPD and how I think it affected me in our relationship while we were apart and she was supportive. Guilt had been weighing on my mind heavy and it felt really good for it to be lifted and I finally felt like I was moving on and accepting that I needed to let things go. Queue me having a mental breakdown for a few weeks because of that and other issues, but I came out on the other side feeling good for a few days. 

That is until she knocked on my door and gave me the birthday present that she never got delivered til multiple months after my bday. I thought that was sweet at the time but then she asked me if i wanted to come and hang out with her and I was being pissy about other stuff and said no. Now that's been weighing on my mind again, because it's weird to me that she wants to spend time together alone. While I didn't say I still had feelings for her in my message to her I made it kind of clear that things still arent the same between us. Later, she invited me to play games with her and her friend but her friend left after a few mins and it was just me and her playing... It felt so nice to just play games with her again and make her laugh. We stayed up really late and i swear she was acting like she did when we first started dating with the tone of her voice and how she was complimenting me. When we stopped she told me that she missed spending time with me and that she always has so much fun with me. We watched a movie with some friends the next day and she and I joked and talked for a while. I swear the way that she interacts with me is different. She gets quiet and when I'm talking to someone else and say sth funny she does this thing where she repeats what i said and laughs to herself. I don't see her do that with anyone else, and it's when she used to do before we got together because she's shy im assuming.

It scares me how much playing those games with her changed my mental. It had been weeks of me just waking up, sitting in bed, sleeping again and just wanting to die because I can't be happy. Her spending that time with me was like giving water to a wilted plant and it scares me that i allow her to have that affect on me. I can't exist without a consistent stream of love and validation from the people I care about. If I don't get that I hate them and myself, sometimes one more than the other.

I just want to move past her. I really want to believe that all of these signs are true and that she is interested in me again. I just can't trust myself. I wish i wasnt so fucking crazy and was just normal. I want to move past her so badly but I crave her attention and it hurts. The thought of her with someone else makes me want to vomit. I just feel so inadequate. In all honesty, all of my other experiences have been with women who I think are more attractive than her, which is why I think I was so off put by her advances on me in the first place. Obviously, none of those worked out, but I tried things with this one just to see what it was like and I ended up really liking her. And yet it still didnt work out. I know it's stupid and relationships arent built around that stuff. It just hurts.

215,"First of all i hope you‚Äôre having a wonderful day. I am a male teen who hit 18 last month. 
These 2 years was hard for me but last 4 month was torture. I am constantly having existential crisis, having fear of death. I graduated from high school this year and had an exam for university. We have a really shitty system in my country, it made me negative for the last 4 years. I couldn‚Äôt get enough score on exam and i have to try again next year. It sucks a lot, i had a pressure last year because of exam but this year it‚Äôs higher. I don‚Äôt wanna study because of that, i wanna do things i love but I can‚Äôt because of this shitty exam. I have to study until june 2021. I always had a bad relationship with studying. I love reading books and i always thought they help me became better person unlike school. Briefly school and exam has a big factor on my mental state. This august we‚Äôve lost a neighbor, it was a traumatic experience for me at least. I‚Äôve never saw anybody die in front of my eyes. He died because of an heart attack. After that day i am constantly having fear of losing people i care about.Thinking about the worst case scenarios like car crashes etc. something traumatic. I was okay, starting to heal or I thought that at least but last week i almost had a traumatic experience,my mom took our cat outside for hanging out, took photos with him.I‚Äôve stayed home. When i called her she was crying.She said he escaped and climbed to a tall tree. She immediately called firefighters. When they tried to grab him he jumped from tree and fell. She took him to vet immediately. I didn‚Äôt know until i called her. I started to get worried because it was late. I knew something bad happened. It scared shit out of me and yes it happened. Right know our boy is okay healing thankfully. But it shook me again. I don‚Äôt know what am i going to do if lost someone. It scares me. 
I went therapist but in here they just give prescriptions, they don‚Äôt really listen. So that didn‚Äôt help. I know it cant be similar but if you had this mental state or should i say sickness, how did you heal? What should i do?",28Nov2020,1
216,"To preface this, I have been in therapy for two years for this specific issue now and no progress has been made. I also have an intense phobia of vomiting, which is where all of this started.

&amp;#x200B;

Three years ago, my gastroparesis was in a horrible flare-up and I was sick, SICK sick for weeks. Nauseous all the time, tired, but didn't throw up. I was nauseous 24-7 for so long. I finally snapped and HAD to go to a doctor for meds or treatment or just SOMETHING to make it stop. On this day, I felt extremely sick. I had never been motion sick before, in my life, ever, but for some reason the car ride made me feel sicker and sicker and I almost threw up. I immediately had to get out of the car. My then-boyfriend (now ex) pulled over, screaming at me, and threatened to smack me if I didn't get back in the car. I couldn't get back in the car.

After that every time I get into a car (even a car that isn't moving) I feel like I'm going to vomit and my anxiety spikes so high that I'm practically peeling my skin off to get away from the feeling. Therapy has done nothing. We've tried exposure, CBT, the eye movement thing, and so far the only thing that vaguely allows me to get into a car (for maybe 5-10 minutes at a time at most) is 2mg of ativan. I can't do anything on a whim anymore, it has to be planned around these stupid goddamn medications. My friends stopped including me in anything over the past 3 years and I know it's because of the car thing. I'm tired of sitting at home, bitter and wishing I was dead. I can't do this. Please, someone fucking help me. I am desperate.",28Nov2020,1
217,"I don't have anything today other than God. He showed me some signs which I'm grateful for but they never change anything. The next day is still a marathon that I have to keep running for somebody's else pride. A few years ago I lived my dream. I had real friends, a girlfriend I loved and recieved hugs from which meant so much, optimistic and most of all I was the king of the world. No matter what happend, it never stood in my way. Bullies kept bullying me but they never affected me, I was still happy. All that changed when I started 7th grade. 

My girlfriend cheated on a guy known for being an aggresive person. My real friends went to another school and kept going with their life that I am not a part of anymore. As usual I'm being bullied for the stupidest reason possible, pessimistic and the most lonely guy in the entire city. At first I thought this was a bad month where only bad stuff happend but that was wrong, this kept going for 3 years now. The first thing that happend was that my math teacher started verbal abuse me. As I got math dyslexia, no matter how hard I try I will never pass this class and I'm accepting that but still try to understand. Anyways the math teacher called me slurs for not solving a question and it kept going til he got fired a year later. So much more happend as an example people started to look down on me. Whenever I talked or even if I draw the slightly attention. All they would see is a lowlife l\*ser. I am still in this situation and it got to that point that I am being silenced by people for talking. 

This year (2 years later) my grandma died which made stuff even worse for me in school. My grandma was the only thing that mattered for me in this world because she was the only one that gave me support. She died at 67 years age by cancer. The feeling of loneliness in me reached another level than before. Before I could live with it because some things lightened up my day. Those are gone. Everyday I hold back myself from tears, I got more mental illnesses. Paranoia, Depression, Anxiety. I wanna scream but it doesn't matter. Whatever happens, nobody cares because they are more focused on their own wellbeing. 

I reached out to therapists but they all said the same thing to talk with people. This is really unproffesional in this case because narcissistic people don't care about others and my entire town is full of them. I need to recover by myself because other's help isn't provided. 

Everyday I gotta manage to survive. I used gaming to escape from this reality but it no longer helps. I disconnected so many times from games that I can't even think of them. The only way out of this is by drugs which I don't wanna take, those things will ruin my life even more but at some point I don't even care. I just wanna escape this torture. 

**God's part**

Exactly one week ago I went to the closest church nearby and asked God for guidance and lit a candle for my grandma. I have asked before but I'm still stuck in this nightmare and I started to believe God is silly and fake. So sitting in that bench, folding my hands into praying hands. I asked my question for God quietly and walked away. When I got home, I was home alone playing games tryna escape from my life. Suddenly on my balcony shows a cat up. Which is literaly impossible, getting up there is 3-4 meters high with no objects close to it to take help from. I rushed out to see if I was hallucinating but I wasn't. There was a cat on my balcony. The eyes of it was as shocked as me, it didn't even feel real. Someone took it there without it knowing besides I have never seen that cat in my entire life. When I helped it down I got back to my computer and searched what a cat symbolises but I didn't get any straight answers. I suddenly remembered my grandma gave me a book about spirit animals so I looked trough it and searched for cat. A cat means according to a book: to love yourself. Whatever it was it managed to make life a little bit better however I need alot of more advices to fill in the missing screws.",28Nov2020,1

222,"Did any of you ever have a comfort blanket?

I did and couldn‚Äôt get rid of mine until the 4th grade. It was old, tattered, and my mom was dying to get rid of it.

&gt;Comfort blankets are blankets kids have when they‚Äôre young and get really emotionally attached to.

One day when I got back home from school, I found a brand new blanket on top of my bed. I got so mad that I threw a tantrum. I cried, screamed, and accused my mom of being a bully.

Now getting used to life without my comfort blanket was really hard. Not only was I still mad but I missed my old blanket. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I missed cuddling with it. I missed the smell of it. I missed the comfort it brought me when I got scared at night.

But eventually I outgrew the comfort blanket. I realized that I was honestly too old to have one. A friend of mine even mentioned that she had gotten rid of hers years ago and that made me think it was time for me to move on.

When we get rid of the Dead Petals in our lives, we go through a similar experience.

&gt;[Dead Petal Behaviors](https://heem.substack.com/p/removing-the-dead-petals-in-our-lives) are the self-destructive coping mechanisms we developed in light of our Emotional Debt. These are the behaviors that we turn to even though they hurt us or hold us back.

The Dead Petal Behaviors (DPB) are like comfort blankets. They are the things we turn to when we‚Äôre in pain. They‚Äôre the things we rely on when we get scared and removing them will feel horrible at first.

Why? Because we have gotten so used to DPB‚Äôs that we think that it‚Äôs the norm. We think that getting drunk every night is normal. Being in pain is normal. Feeling depressed is normal.

It even gets to the point where we think that DPB‚Äôs are apart of who are as people. We think that we should feel lonely. That something is wrong with us if we‚Äôre not in pain. We even begin to depend on the DPB‚Äôs in really unhealthy ways.

I remember I was watching a Conan O‚ÄôBrien interview and he said that for the longest time he thought he needed to be depressed in order to be funny. This is actually a common mentality amongst many creatives because they think that they can only produce something great out of a place of darkness.

There is a certain degree of truth in this idea. Some amazing pieces of art were created during times of incredible sadness or loss. But greatness doesn‚Äôt come from artificially created suffering either.

As we pursue a healthy behaviors, we need to remind ourselves that we are not our Dead Petal Behaviors. We are greater than the pain. We are more than the suffering we‚Äôve become so accustomed to. It‚Äôs time to stop treating DPB‚Äôs like 8 year old Andrew does with his comfort blanket.

Is it going to feel weird? Yes. Uncomfortable? Yes. Will we feel like a different person? Hopefully!

But if when we do, embrace it. Lean into it. Fight to stay in it because that means we‚Äôre moving in the right direction.

225,"Looking for a little bit of advice from anyone with similar experience.   


Been on Zoloft since summer 2015, worked my way up to about 150-200 (went back and forth between those two doses a couple times). I was also thrown on a benzo in 2015 and in August 2018 had nasty benzo withdrawal that prompted me about 8 months later to begin the process of tapering my Zoloft.

I was at 200mg April 2019, went 175-150-125-100 the next few months. Each dose drop I'd be hyper anxious and mood swings for a few weeks then kinda stabilize. When I started getting lower than 100mg things started getting a little dark and seasonal depression def hit harder than usual but I kept going. By February of 2020 I had hit 25mg and I figured I‚Äôd hang out there for a little bit but then covid hit and gyms shut down (my main coping mechanism). 1 month turned into another 9 months hanging out at 25mg but now I‚Äôm looking to finally face the last bit of this taper.

I‚Äôm kinda afraid of this last bit, I‚Äôve heard it can be the worst. Should I consider liquid Zoloft? Or should I just ride it out, cut the 25mg in half for a few weeks then start skipping days? Am I overthinking it? I saw a new psych recently who said it‚Äôs a pediatric dose and I shouldn‚Äôt worry about withdrawals...but the doc who took me off benzos said the same thing so I‚Äôm weary...

Thanks in advance!",28Nov2020,1
226,"There's actually quite a few issues deep down but I won't delve deep into them.

My main problem is something I thought I'd fixed. Basically I can't stop myself from having self harm or suicidal thoughts when I can't control something. I used to have this when I was younger, and although my upbringing wasn't as bad as others there was a few things that contributed to me being mentally unwell. 

But I digress, as a teen I self harmed, and I have also tried to kill myself but stopped right at the last minute. I thought this was a teen phase, but I went to the doctors and did some counselling. They put me on pills that didn't work for me, didn't really revisit it and counselling stopped after I turned 18.

I felt better from 18-21 with only having these episodes a lot less than before. But since moving back home I slowly find them creeping back in. For example a few nights ago I found that lack of control during a situation taking over me. I felt like I would never be good enough and I could never be useful to anyone and found myself going through the rituals i would before attempted self harm or suicide when I was younger. It took me a lot of effort to stop myself but it was very difficult. When I'm not in this state I feel ""fine"" and I can rule the world. But its becoming a lot worse with the lack of control I've had growing. 


I have thought about contacting my doctor but with the world how it is, they are only doing telephone appointments and I'm not in an environment where I can talk freely about this at home with others hearing. 

I really don't know what to do, I can't stop myself going from such highs to such lows all the time and I really am scared. I don't have that support bubble around me, and I don't want my boyfriend or family to look at me differently. Any advice? I'm in the UK by the way.",28Nov2020,1
227,"Hello, I was recently diagnosed with two anxiety disorders and as a person who has been raised to ""suck it up"" and just carry on with life, it's hard to learn that I have to take care of my mental and emotional well-being. It is especially hard because this mindset has now got me doing self-destructive behaviors (sleep deprivation and forcing myself to ignore feeling and isolate) to ""prove"" that I can be better/need help.

How can I move forward to acceptance, and start learning how to take care of myself?",28Nov2020,1
228,"I, a 27 year-old man, struggle allowing someone to see me without my shirt on. I took my shirt off last night with the person I'm seeing, who kept complimenting me; however, I just felt ashamed, scared, and ugly. 

I was sexually assaulted when I was 19. I think it's one of the reasons that has led me to struggle being too vulnerable. It sounds weird, but having my shirt off, being fully naked, with someone around makes me feel too vulnerable and it makes me panic inside. 

I'm embarrassed that my body isn't perfect. After my assault I became unhappy, I wouldn't say depressed, but unhappy enough that I developed an unhealthy relationship with food and put on some weight that I haven't fully lost. That's the other reason. I actually think I have an eating disorder, too. I'd eat so much food the one day and then try eat nothing the next or excessively exercise. I'd set myself challenges to not eat any chocolate for a month. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know if I have an eating disorder or how to get rid of it. I just want to be able to let someone ""see"" me, fully. I'm emotionally hurting myself with the words I fling at myself. I struggle to look at myself in the mirror.

I have ENOUGH of myself and all these 17 years of unjustified existance. 

I‚Äôm probably wasting time about complaining regarding these things, but again, ENOUGH. 

I achieved nothing substantial in the past 12 years of my education since primary school, and now that I‚Äôm in 5th year, things are not good. My grades are shit, complete shit. In Junior Cert they mostly composed of D‚Äôa and C‚Äôs, not good enough for me. And all of this is repeating again.

School is beginning to overwhelm me again, too much homework, and yet I have to somehow spend hours studying. WHO THE FUCK CAME
UP WITH THIS BULLSHIT? I just cannot keep up, and in 3 weeks my winter exams will come. Great.

It doesn‚Äôt help that I can‚Äôt even deal with myself emotionally. Right now I‚Äôve been beating my new record pulling my hair out, due to all the stress and pressure. This just further ruins my non-existant self-esteem. I just can‚Äôt study, I can‚Äôt even learn an essay for geography properly. And it‚Äôs just one subject, compared with many more I have to study and prepare for, on top of doing the fucking homework. 

Back in 2015, 5 years ago, these are exactly the things I stressed about. Being a complete failure, unintelligent, unlikable and unstable. Unfortunately, it seems all my worries from my 12 year old self have come true, despite having a  positive outlook, things will have to get better when I get older, more stable, right? Well fuck you past me, you were right. I‚Äôm a sick fuck.

Oh and regarding attitude. Nearly every month, week, I hope that things will improve. ‚ÄûOk new month/week, it will be better and I will get better!‚Äù Bullshit.

Seriously, I just want to jump out the window from my room more and more now. I‚Äôve not gotten anywhere to my dream future. I can‚Äôt get my shit together, neither will I in college. R.I.P dreams of studying computer science and becoming a game dev, GOODBYE! So sweet, so unattainable. The forbidden fruit of my life. Stability. 

It‚Äôs hard to write any of these. My mind literally goes numb when I try to write these things down, so I‚Äôm rushing as hard as possible with what comes to my mind.

I know this might not be seen, but if anyone could help me or give advice on this then I would very much appreciate it.

So I have a friend in Indonesia who's not feeling well mentally. They have talked to me and I've done as much as I can to help them being so far away from them. But they're close to hitting a wall and I want to help, but don't know what to do. Stress from schoolwork is one of the big issues for them, having a big pile of unfinished homework and stuff. But from what I know, there are other things in play as well.

Now they want to get therapy but are afraid of telling their mom as they're almost certain she'll say that they're making excuses and won't go anywhere in their life like this. Not to mention the fact that she really wants them (almost pressuring them into) become a doctor, even tho they don't want to.

So are there any free therapy services or anything similar I could recommend to them, ones that don't need parental approval. Or do you have tips on how to deal with their situation that I could give them.

The problem is, I don't have anything else. I drifted apart from my friends a long time ago so I never go out apart from with my family and I have absolutely no support network. I am massively overworked in my job and it often makes me feel ill, so I start projects on the side so I actually have something in my life to focus on apart from my family. That's why I set up my business, and more recently my YouTube channel. Well covid has completely ruined my business (and the UK wedding industry in general) and my YouTube channel has slowed down because I struggle to find time to make content. 

So I'm nearly back to square one. 

Going back a few years, I was really ill. I was suicidal and was dosed up to the eyeballs on meds. It was a really dark time and I had to take a couple of months off work (Completely unheard of for me) while I attempted to sort my head out. Well it worked - my business started to thrive, I gradually started to feel better, and I managed to remove myself from the meds on my own because they made me feel worse (Please do not do this). Then covid hit. 

The other night, I scared myself. I was feeling rubbish and I randomly burst into tears and couldn't stop. Now that I don't really have anything to focus on or anyone to talk to, I can feel myself slipping back to that dark place. I can't go back there, it will kill me. 

TL;DR I have a young family, a good job (which I despise) but no friends or support. I set up a business and other projects, but they have failed/are failling due to various reasons. I used to be really depressed, dosed up to the eyeballs on meds etc, and I can feel myself slipping back to that dark place now that I don't have anything to focus on.",28Nov2020,1

**Bruce Lee**. 

So, what did he mean by this? During this quote, the legendary Bruce Lee motivated people with the famous quote ‚Äú*be like water*‚Äù. During the quote, he says to ‚Äú*empty your mind*‚Äù, and also explains how a person should be like water, ‚Äú*formless*‚Äù. The legendary actor goes on to explain that water has no shape, whatever it‚Äôs poured into, it becomes it, whether it‚Äôs a bottle, teapot or a cup. When he explained for people to be ‚Äú*formless*‚Äù, he means that people shouldn‚Äôt allow these moves to be trapped in a certain mindset. Instead of that, that particular person should **adapt to certain situations, change and to grow**. 

During his time with his Martial Arts Master (Yip Man), Bruce Lee discovered that no matter how hard you strike water, you wouldn‚Äôt hurt it. Because of this, Lee decided that he wanted to become like ‚Äú*nature of water*‚Äù. Lee had believed that any person in the World can achieve his/hers goal by becoming like water, through the ‚Äúart of detachment*, which involves relaxing and emptying your mind. 

**Empty your mind, be formless, be shapeless, like water. Water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend**.

246,"The story of my life is about surviving and handling all the problems while making the right choices. I‚Äôll make you look at this story from my point of view...
I was diagnosed with ADHD.
I was diagnosed with Anxiety.
I was diagnosed with Sensory Integration.
Life was always hard but i could keep up with making those difficult decisions everyday:
To get up from the bed and start another day with all sorts of struggles that weren‚Äôt normal or didn‚Äôt always have answers.
I handled it pretty well until 7th grade. That year is one of the most horrible years of my life.
It all started with the death of my grandfather
At Friday the 13th of January 2017. I was so disappointed I didn‚Äôt spend the time i had with him, hearing all of his amazing stories from many years ago. Until 7th grade i used to play basketball 4 times a week at a team, after my grandpa‚Äôs death I decided to quit playing. I felt so alone and so lost at life. I felt like i have so much things ahead but i also felt like the end is near...
The anxiety got to me, I started overthinking about everything, I was so afraid to try new things or do the things i loved the most. I ate to feel better for my mental pain, I put on almost 15 kg. I knew people loved me and cared about me but i still felt so alone with no one who can understand my pain.
I was at the lowest point of my life. I couldn‚Äôt sleep and I couldn‚Äôt get up from my bed, i always thought: ‚Äúwhy do i need all of this, why do i need to take on this pain and all of these problems. Why couldn‚Äôt it all just end?‚Äù.
It was one of these days that i thought couldn‚Äôt get any worse so I decided to end it all, I decided to end all the pain, all the problems, all the thoughts, and most important of all I decided to end my own LIFE. 
I went out of my room window and stepped out of it to the roof, now i have the chance and i need to make the right choice - if i jump or if i stay alive and try handle all of these problems.
I thought to myself: ‚Äúall of IT could end, right here, right now‚Äù.
Meanwhile my mom got to the garden with my sister and they both tried to convince me to get down from the roof, i could see the fear and their concerns about me in their eyes.
A police car came to my house and also trued to convince me to get down. After a long time i stood up there with that choice to make i decided to get down and tackle all of my problems, CONQUER all my DREAMS and decisions that would make MY LIFE better!
from that day i got so much motivation to keep going, to keep dealing with my fears and anxiety. I started working out, started to lose weight and build up muscle, and most important build up my confidence. 
From that time EVERY morning i get up no matter at what time or how much hours of sleep i got i ALWAYS appreciate the fact that I‚Äôm here, breathing, standing with my family and friends. I have a quote that is engraved in my head that says: ‚ÄúH.O.P.E - Hold On, Pain Ends‚Äù.
To be honest it is very hard to believe that when you are at the lowest point of your life you need to believe that Things will get better.

Hey guys, I just wanted to share my experiences as a man and someone who may have experienced racism probably one of my first times living on this planet. 

Keep in mind, this all happened when Covid was getting worse. 

I got jumped and beat down with my girlfriend F20 on May 15th 2020, and it that experience hit me hard and hit me rock bottom. I was sitting on the bench with my girlfriend and this all happened at a local beach, we were talking about random stuff and we were talking about mainly how peaceful and quiet it was when my girlfriend mentioned there‚Äôs a large crowd behind us it was like more than 10 people, all of them around the same age as us. 

The three of them that attacked me were white, all white men when they were walking behind us it was like one of them wanted to catch my attention by yelling the ‚ÄúN‚Äù, word. I heard it the first time, and I ignored it. And then he says it again to probably catch my attention, but it was more louder. And so I stared back at them, and then the main one, my attacker he was short, buzz cut, had a lisp, and freckles asked me, ‚ÄúWhat you say?‚Äù And I started to look around me to see if he was talking to anyone else, and I replied, ‚ÄúAre you talking to me?‚Äù He just nodded. And I said, ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt talking to you, and I didn‚Äôt say anything.‚Äù 

And it looks like this guy wants to start problems and it looks like he was looking for a fight, too. He says to me, ‚ÄúOh, alright, I thought so.‚Äù So I stood up to him because I wasn‚Äôt going to take shit from some fake tough guy, who was surrounded by his friends I didn‚Äôt care. I stood my ground, I was willing to protect my girlfriend and I. 


They surrounded me, all three of them, and all three attacked me. I couldn‚Äôt land a single punch, three of them were swinging at me, they swing at me pretty hard landing me to the ground the main one, (The short white guy,) was stomping on my head calling me racial slurs, the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word that ends with an ‚ÄúR‚Äù, my girlfriend joined in and she got punched on the chin and it made me so angry that I couldn‚Äôt protect her I tackled the main one, the short one to the ground, but the other two were on me that I couldn‚Äôt stand on my ground because it 3V1. 

The main one called my girlfriend a slut, when he shouted at her face and pushed her away. And on top of that, he doesn‚Äôt even know her. Keep in mind also, my girlfriend is mixed, half white and half black, but she looked more white than black aside from her hair. 


I don‚Äôt even know these guys, I don‚Äôt even know why this happened, but I‚Äôm pissed off these guys got away with it and eventually the fight was broken apart by two ladies, and that they called the police, and report what happened. The police came, they took my report, and a picture of my face and said they‚Äôll do their best to get them.

Few days went by, we found out the guys who jumped us, gave the police the information of the people that jumped me and my girlfriend, and then told us they‚Äôll give us a call. 

Guess what?


They never gave us a call, and those guys are still out there. And ever since then I been taking my frustration at the gym, getting bigger and looking to release all that anger and hatred.

I have PTSD and several experiences of trauma. I'm just beginning to understand them now as I was diagnosed a few months ago.

But recently I had a very horrifying troubling dream. I dreamt that I was being sexually assaulted and completely violated. The next night I had another dream of sexual violence. It was truly terrifying. I woke up panicked and shaking, almost like how I wake up after flashback nightmares. I couldn't stop getting flashback memories of the physical sensations from the dream. They felt so real (I know I'm writing in past tense, but it's still going on and has been for the past few weeks)

I feel so on edge and look for danger everywhere I go feeling constantly threatened. I know that's a PTSD symptom but it feels different than it did before the dreams.

My understanding is that PTSD comes from ill-formed memories, so I can't imagine your dreams could cause a trauma response like that since those memories are already formed/stored differently.

But I also have no idea why I experienced those dreams like I did/still-do. I've never experienced any sexual assault/violence. I haven't been thinking about it recently. My close friends haven't told me they've experienced it. Where did this come from? Why did it feel so real?

How can I process it if it was just a dream?

They got really angry and annoyed. Ever since then that teacher and other teachers keep on insisting that I should go.

I have looked hut u can only find ones that I need to pay for (I don‚Äôt have any money and my parents monitor my debit card and they will se e) I just want to see if I have it or not and then take further action,

261,"My life is objectively great. I'm studying what I love, have amazing grades, my family is amazing and financially stable and I have a few close friends that I know care about me (and I'm generally on good terms with other people even if we're not close). Objectively.

Yet here I am in the middle of another crying spell for no logical reason. My diet has gone to shit and so has my sleep schedule. My usual procrastination has reached dangerous levels but I still manage to get my work done so it doesn't bite me in the ass later. Somehow I manage to sit down and power through it to finish my obligations. But it's so exhausting. I know just how much time I need to do sth and I put in effort to do it so I can get it off my back.

It's not my first time I've handled feelings like these but the last time I did I was in high school and I literally didn't give a shit about my life. Now I want to live well and I want to be happy, but I'm just deep in the pit. I'm not suicidal or considering harm, and if  comes to it that's surely the point when I'm seeking help. I've reached out to my best friend but I think he's at a loss and I don't blame him. I can't expect him to help me or magically make me feel better but I did think he was the best person to talk to now (since we've shared a lot of stuff not even our families know). I'm scared of asking for help and the situation with mental health treatment here is... Way behind when you compare it to the US.

I've come to a conclusion that save for that one friend, no one actually gives a fuck about me as a person and only care for me in an academical way. We're great colleagues but they're not interested in me as a person, despite me putting in effort to get to know them, to remember the stuff they enjoy and do out of college, their little quirks that they show etc. The fact that the ones closer to me plainly admit being envious of me doesn't help either. I just want to be a friend as a person and have a person as a friend, college be damned. Is that too much to ask for? I just seem to exist within college context and not outside of it, if that makes sense.

As for my family, they're either fighting with their own problems or just enjoy life properly. I don't want to ruin that and admit I'm feeling like shit for no reason when I've seen them handle way worse way better. And some of them have voiced some opinions about depression and depressive feelings that have really put me off in the past, but I had no good counter-arguments.

I don't know what's going on. I don't know why I'm feeling like this and why I'm incapable of handling it. I'm scared that this will be another thing I'll ask to be helped about and instead of being helped I'll get another 'nothing is wrong with you' from the doctors and it'll be swept under the carpet.

I don't understand this shit at all.",28Nov2020,1
262,"I (33)M am looking to try to get my life in order. I have dealt with depression and anxiety all my life. I believe this is probably linked to being on the high end of the Autism spectrum. I haven't been formally diagnosed but I did speak to a therapist a few times and she said that I was likely on the spectrum. I wasn't able to keep seeing her because I couldn't afford it and she made my anxiety worse by refusing to answer any questions with a straight answer. I don't have a good job and no health insurance. I am a competent individual but I get quite overwhelmed easily. Dealing with the cartoonish beuracracy of the medical system and the government causes me to become despondent. I have tried to get help a few times but I always become overwhelmed. Is there any resources to essentially ""hold my hand"" through the process? I'm not even sure what kind of help I need. What is the difference in a therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist or counselor? I just know I need help. At 33, I have no friends, don't speak to any family and I am a virgin. I have never even kissed a woman or been on a date. I do a pretty good job hiding this from people in my day to day life but I sure would like to be ""normal"" and have a few friends and a girlfriend.

265,"Hello, I know my problem might not be as bad as the others' here, but I know it doesn't mean it's not important, and I want to take care of it before it gets worse.

So, basically, I think my self-esteem is constantly changing. At one hand, I see myself as a really smart and empathetic person, kinda good looking too, and feel like I can do anything,literally anything. I often find myself daydreaming of my future, imagining myself to be successful and happy, sometimes of being a famous singer/mangaka/youtuber/animator and so on, even expecting these things to happen in the future, which certainly will happen, because I'm such a great peron, isn't that right? (I'm honestly scared of becoming a narcissist, or maybe I already am one?)

At the other hand however, I have problems with overthinkimg and beating myself up over the slightest things when I'm in a bad mood. It really quickly gets from just regretting something to straight up thinking I'm worthless and I don't deserve anything good. It's not like I think it's true. I'm aware, that all the things I say to myself while overthinkimg are wrong, but it doesn't stop me from believing my negative self-talk, I just ignore the facts. Thankfully, I have a habit of reaching out to my best friend whenever I feel down, but sometimes he just can't help me.

I'm trying to make healty sleeping habits, for now I've been sleeping for at least 6 hours a day (usually around 7)for a long time,and I'm kinda proud of this?

What should I do? What can I do to stop myself from the negative self-talk and from making unrealistic expectations about my future?

266,"A little background on me: I am an 18 year old adopted Chinese living in the United States, and a software developer and business owner.

When I was 12, I started taking interest in data analysis, and thats when I think I screwed up, because I pushed everything else away, including friends, to learn and improve my skills. Now, my job deals with data, and it has consumed me. I haven't taken a break from work in a long time, I work on weekends, and pretty much any spare time I spend working. I feel pressured to hit the next milestone, and when I do, I feel no satisfaction, and the urge to work harder to hit the next one.

I regularly work 15+ hours per day to speed up production of software so the others who work for the business can work 5 hours a day and take weekends off.

My parents don't really care about the work that I do, or that I am able to help people all over the world with the software I make, they just like it when I tell them I made X% more money than last month.

267,"Thanks to COVID I have lost large parts of my former life. I can't meet my friends anymore. I can't find a job to pay rent and bills. I have hard time advancing in my university studies. I feel just drained and unreal. I have started to have phases of derealization; I just don't feel ""real"". In a short time, my whole life has turned upside down. And there is nothing I can do about it. I can't stop the pandemic. I just have to live this life that is hardly worth living. I don't know if things turn better.

269,"The story of my life is about surviving and handling all the problems while making the right choices. I‚Äôll make you look at this story from my point of view...
I was diagnosed with ADHD.
I was diagnosed with Anxiety.
I was diagnosed with Sensory Integration.
Life was always hard but i could keep up with making those difficult decisions everyday:
To get up from the bed and start another day with all sorts of struggles that weren‚Äôt normal or didn‚Äôt always have answers.
I handled it pretty well until 7th grade. That year is one of the most horrible years of my life.
It all started with the death of my grandfather
At Friday the 13th of January 2017. I was so disappointed I didn‚Äôt spend the time i had with him, hearing all of his amazing stories from many years ago. Until 7th grade i used to play basketball 4 times a week at a team, after my grandpa‚Äôs death I decided to quit playing. I felt so alone and so lost at life. I felt like i have so much things ahead but i also felt like the end is near...
The anxiety got to me, I started overthinking about everything, I was so afraid to try new things or do the things i loved the most. I ate to feel better for my mental pain, I put on almost 15 kg. I knew people loved me and cared about me but i still felt so alone with no one who can understand my pain.
I was at the lowest point of my life. I couldn‚Äôt sleep and I couldn‚Äôt get up from my bed, i always thought: ‚Äúwhy do i need all of this, why do i need to take on this pain and all of these problems. Why couldn‚Äôt it all just end?‚Äù.
It was one of these days that i thought couldn‚Äôt get any worse so I decided to end it all, I decided to end all the pain, all the problems, all the thoughts, and most important of all I decided to end my own LIFE. 
I went out of my room window and stepped out of it to the roof, now i have the chance and i need to make the right choice - if i jump or if i stay alive and try handle all of these problems.
I thought to myself: ‚Äúall of IT could end, right here, right now‚Äù.
Meanwhile my mom got to the garden with my sister and they both tried to convince me to get down from the roof, i could see the fear and their concerns about me in their eyes.
A police car came to my house and also trued to convince me to get down. After a long time i stood up there with that choice to make i decided to get down and tackle all of my problems, CONQUER all my DREAMS and decisions that would make MY LIFE better!
from that day i got so much motivation to keep going, to keep dealing with my fears and anxiety. I started working out, started to lose weight and build up muscle, and most important build up my confidence. 
From that time EVERY morning i get up no matter at what time or how much hours of sleep i got i ALWAYS appreciate the fact that I‚Äôm here, breathing, standing with my family and friends. I have a quote that is engraved in my head that says: ‚ÄúH.O.P.E - Hold On, Pain Ends‚Äù.
To be honest it is very hard to believe that when you are at the lowest point of your life you need to believe that Things will get better. 
But believe me, not just someone who doesn‚Äôt understand the pain, someone who has been through it too, i have to say that YOU are Not Alone!
And i need you to really believe and know that Things DO get better!",28Nov2020,1
270,"Hi guys,

I am in high school, and recently I have been feeling very paranoid. It's only been getting worse recently. I was writing my college essays, and all summer, I was beyond scared that someone was going to hack into an email to get my essays. I know it sounds stupid, but I've spent days crying my eyes out because I was convinced that I accidentally copy-pasted my essays on Reddit. Like I know that I didn't but this little voice in my head tells me ""what if you accidentally posted it. your life will be ruined if someone copied your essays. no college will accept you and you will be punished"" I always thought that someone was going to look through my camera, and I would constantly be paranoid that someone is recording me or something. This made me so depressed to the point that I tried to avoid using my laptop, which made me fall back on homework and classwork. Even for emails, I get scared that someone has hacked through my email, sent emails to others, and deleted it so that I can't see that it happened. I'm too scared to talk to anyone because I am scared that I will be framed in some sort of way for no reason. There are so many more instances. I understand that this may be paranoid schizophrenia although I am not too sure. Is there any way to heal me? I think my worst fear is to not have a bright future for myself, so I overthink things and think that everyone's trying to do come after me.",28Nov2020,1

She complains about me doing nothing around the house, when in reality she's the one that goes on shopping sprees and then dumps the stuff around our minuscule apartment and then talks about buying MORE furniture for our tiny apartment to hold all the stuff we have, 80% of which we don't need.
