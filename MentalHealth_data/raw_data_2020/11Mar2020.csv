0,"I’m a guy and I was sexually assaulted by a kid who lived down the street from me when I was younger. He was a lot bigger than me but my age. My parents walked in on it happening and they didn’t believe me. He told him I was participating in it and I was crying saying no I wasn’t. I got the Bible thrown at me and they started making me go to youth at church. So I had to surpress all the feelings I had about it. I didn’t let it effect me. Because that was my first sexual experience it messed me up and that’s what lead to my porn problem. I distracted my feelings with that. Long story short since 18 ive felt the desire to hook up with guys. I’m not gay, I find no attraction to them. But I keep wanting to have sex and be controlled during. And I hate it. I’ve never enjoyed any time that I’ve done it. And I hate myself after. And then I say I won’t do it again but I always end up doing it again. I want it to stop. I want to stop feeling the need to. I want to stop wanting to do it because it makes me upset that I continue to feel the need to do something I don’t like. And if I was actually gay I’d be like okay but I’ve thought it through and I know I’m not. I just want the sex. It’s like if the guy talks to me too much when I get there I snap out of it and become uncomfortable with it again. I’ve had sex with girls and I’ve never been effected by the past. This has messed me up and i don’t know how to move past it.",11Mar2020,1
1,"My husband has suffered for years with health anxiety.  This is not new, but it is different this time.   Unbeknownst to me, he stopped taking his meds about 6 months ago.  He has been doing meditation and mindfulness, so I guess he figured it was no longer necessary to take the meds.   He thought he was able to handle things on his own.   Fast forward to the first week in January when he switched to a new primary care doctor.  He was given a physical and they drew blood to go over his labs.   The very next day, the new doc called to say his PSA level was slightly high, and he wanted him to see a Urologist.....
Game over. That’s all it took.  It’s been a downward spiral ever since.   So here’s the kicker, he has been seeing a psychologist and she has been telling him he does not need to go back on his meds.  She thinks he will be able to work it out with the meditation, etc.  
She is a CBT psychologist, and has been telling him things like  “ you’ve got this” etc.   I am livid and have been contemplating having him go somewhere for treatment.   He’s barely able to function.  He needs help.   I’ve finally convinced him to get back on the meds (Zoloft) but should I do anything else?  Shouldn’t he see a psychiatrist?  He needs someone to help him figure this out.   We have been fine for the last 7 years, but our entire life is upside down, and now I feel like I should do something before it’s too late.   We have good insurance, etc.   I feel like calling his wacko psychologist and telling her to come over to help me get him off the floor and functioning again.  
Right now, we have the 2nd Urologist appt tomorrow, I’ve seen his labs, they are fine.   Do I just find a psychiatrist on-line and make an appointment?",11Mar2020,1
2,"I am a 16 yr old highschool student. A number of events over the past few years have led me to believe I cannot empathize. While I can understand why people feel the way they do occasionally, I cannot feel for them. This has affected me greatly because I can often be seen as insensitive and mean (perhaps rightfully).

When someone is crying, I must pretend I care and feel for them even when I understand the circumstances.

I do not ""get"" people who are affected by trauma of some kind, and I cannot feel for them either.

Time and time again, I find myself understanding people but not really feeling for them.

I cannot comfort people, and I am often not at all connected to them.

Lastly, I cannot recall ever feeling people's pain only understanding it. I thought people were faking it when they were sad for people until I discovered ""amable"" empathy.

What could this be??

3," My life before Suicidal ideations  


Before I was suicidal, I was “normal” , I went to work everyday, I hung out with friends, I had somewhat of a love life. I made a decent amount of money, could afford to travel, spend time with my family in Boston during the holidays, pay off my debt, with money left over to save. I was living what I thought was the American dream. What could go wrong.  


Reality Check:  


Well the truth was I didn’t really like my job, I was only clocking in everyday because I enjoyed getting a paycheck, well I enjoyed the people who I worked with but the actual work not so much. I constantlly looked at spreadsheets day in and day out; when I truly craved to just go to work and connect with my coworkers, chitchat about their lives , what they did for the weekend, where they planned on going for their next family vacation, that was the best part of my job. But that not what I got paid for; I got paid to analyze. To review budget and forecast for reasonable.  


And my friends even though large in number, I was feeling more disconnected to them, I wouldn’t allow my self to be vulnerable with anyone; I pushed a away my feeling. I was super detached, but this was the only way I knew to be; I didn’t want to appear weak.  


I’m sad and don’t know why  


There became a time when I would literally go to work, come home, veg out in front of the tv for two hrs then go to sleep. I was exaighsted, I was drained. However I thought, this is normal, this must be how everyone feels after a day at work.  


I found myself not have the energy to socialize or be around people during the weekend, I was slowly but surely isolating myself( sign number 1)  


Work was starting to get a bit more complicated for me, I could hardly concentrate - I would mentally beat up on myself calling myself stupid, thinking how on earth had I been able to fool these people for so long, I’m an imposter ( sign number 2)  


But I kept going and pushing as I got mentally weaker, and weaker, until suddenly boom I hit a wall and I found myself on the stairwell in my apartment with a bottle of red wine that I had purchased as a gift for a friend, and anxiety medication that I had just been proscribed by my psychotherapist.  


I had started taking them a week before but they weren’t working fast enough and I was over it all, I was over not feeling loved connected, I was over going to a job I didn’t really like, just to pay bills, life was pointless to me and I felt like a burden.  


So I got my pen I wrote my family a goodbye letter letting them know where they could find money for my burial, and I researched ways to end my life.  


This way wasn’t a sure bet, so  
I had a backup plan. So I did it, I took the pills and I went to sleep hoping to never wake up again.  


But I work up, darn, it didn’t work, I thought, welp time to try attempt number two.  


KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!  


Wait what, ugh, who is it , I said. “ it’s the leasing manager she replied.  


Now wait I paid my rent, what could she possibly want. I opened the door.  


Hi, we are doing a wellness check? (A what, why? I thought)  


Your cousin Janice called and said she hasn’t heard from you all day , she wanted to make sure you were ok.  


Janice is my younger cousin, her and I grew up very close. Although she was my younger cousin she was more like a older sister, visiting me in Maryland with her older sister cooking me delicious meals. She knew something was wrong with me and had been calling to check in with me on a daily basis. So when she called and I didn’t pick up she knew I was in danger.  


“Oh I’m fine I answered” and closed the door, ugh I guess they are on to me I thought, now what.  


Knock knock knock , police!!!  


Oh my goodness now the police are here, ugh  


I opened up the door, I knew I couldn’t hide anymore, that was the beginning of my healing journey.  


I spent two weeks in a Mental health hospital in Maryland, then took a break from work and DC to heal and figure out with my next step would be, that took what. Felt like an eternity  


Healing ain’t easy!  


So I moved to Connecticut and that where I spent my time for a year, I enrolled in therapy and tried to get back to some sort of normalcy, but it was so hard! I never lived in ct before and although my family was there and I love them everyone had a job and a life and I was just there watching them live there life.  


I had no clue what I was doing , what I wanted to do, I just desired to get back to some sort of normalcy stat! This whole not going to work thing felt foreign to me, I was disconnected from myself and others, how was I supposed to heal like this.  


Well, just about every night I was trying to figure out how was I going to end my life, I had heard about fetnonyl and how toxic it was , I need it! So for another year while in counseling I was still actively looking to end my life.  


Well I landed back in the hospital again, this time it was because I called the Suicide warm line, and they could hear in my voice i wasn’t well, so East Hartford police came and got me from my cousins house and once again, I was in a mental health hospital locked up and taken out of society  


I hated this place more than anything, I felt like a prisoner and helpless.  


At this point my family thought it was best for me to move back home  


This to me was the ultimate sign of failure, move back home??!?!? Ugh but I had no choice, I had been paying on an apartment that I wasn’t living in, and I wasn’t making much progress in Connecticut  


Misery loves company  


Home back in Boston, great. Well at this point I was around my sister who herself had battled depression and suicidal ideations. So we were both out of working trying to figure out how to become a productive member of society, I understood what she was going through and she understood me. I felt bad because I would always give her advice when she was depressed and I realized that not what I need, or she needed. We just needed someone to believe in us.  


So here we go again, therapy, but this time I really like my therapist, she asked me some great questions that really made me think about my life , who I was, and what was important. Oh yeah wait I forgot; I also got the proper diagnosis and was prescribed the correct medication,  that also was a game changer!!!  


The depression started to lift, finally, I could see daily light and started running towards it and never looked back!  


I was ready to go back to work!!but not accounting, nope, I was done with that . New me, new job, so I went to search for a job in the mental health arena. I wanted to help people like me who looked like me. So I headed to the library and started researching “ Black mental health non profit organizations “ o found a handful of organizations but none in Boston.. gasp.  


I refined my search to look for nonprofit organizations in Boston, and nothing came up, what? Your kidding me, then I researched large organizations like Nami to see if they had a minority arm 📷📷, yikes, ok well I guess I’m going to have to do something on my own.  


So I stared purespark , I got on fb, and I shared my story. And now we’ve gone from 1 follower to almost 10,000 in less than a year!  


I went from speaking at one school to being interviewed from multiple podcast and being invited to speak at Siegfried, my ex employer, talk about a full circle moment.  


I attribute a lot of my success to my support, my family who were there every step of the way, who called and prayed for me. I attribute it to the knowledge professionals who questioned my original diagnosis , and prescribed me with the proper medication.

I understand I signed up for this program but myself and many of my classmates did not expect for this to be as intense as it has.

12,"I play my roommate and best friend in smash several nights a week. We're around the same skill level, always have been since we were kids. I have anxiety, depression, a plethora of other issues and I dread every single time I play him. Because no matter what, at some point in the night I will get so very frustrated at the game which causes me to play terribly which causes me to get even more frustrated.  No matter what I try to do I always end up like this. I always end up yelling at myself and getting very depressed after. I literally feel emotional pain from playing this dumb game. I have tried breathing while playing and it doesn't help. I've looked at videos telling me how to get less frustrated at things and they don't help. I've tried so hard to look at it in so many different ways to make it not seem terrible. I come back to it every time hoping ""this will be the time I don't get mad"" and he'll spike me, or read me, or do some whack ass combo and it'll just hurt on the inside. I don't want this to happen. I hate this so much. I hate myself so much for feeling this way every single time. 

I don't even want advice on how to get better at the game. I don't even care about getting better as much as I care about not getting angry at this game. The thing is, I don't get angry at anyone else I play in smash. Nobody. Literally no one makes me feel frustrated or angry or depressed when I play them. I can get oh so very clapped in tournaments and feel disappointed but nothing compared, to what I feel when I play my friend. I hate it so fucking much. I should be happy to have someone I can play against so often who's near my skill level. I should be happy he's so supportive of me and is never trying to be mean about anything. He says he looks at me as his rival, and is always trying to keep up with me. But I simply never believe it, I feel so stupid playing him. I just want to enjoy the game when I play against him. I don't care about getting better at the game, I don't care about if I won a bunch or not, I just want to enjoy the game. 

Outside the game I never feel the slightest bit sad over how many games I lost the night prior. I never feel like I should've won more games and that would make me happy.  I only feel scared to ever play him again because I just know how angry and sad I get after. But I keep coming back to play, hoping that I can get over this stupid feeling one day. I'm starting to really lose hope. I feel like I'll never be able to get over this. I really want help but I also feel like no one understands me. Everyone I talk to just says it's okay and that I should feel happy to play against him. I hate this shit so fucking much. I really hope one of you guys can help me in some way. It legitimately makes me depressed that I can't enjoy one of my favorite games of all time with my best friend.",11Mar2020,1

So it's been a long time coming but today I finally gave in and decided to go on medication for anxiety and depression.
The doctor basically let me choose which medication to go on and she gave me some options. Both of my parents are on Paxil so I figured that would be a safe option to choose, so I opted for that! 
When I got home, I did some more research and really like the effects that Wellbutrin have.
So, my question is, should I call my doctor and have them switch me over to wellbutrin since I have not begun Paxil yet?

We mainly broke up because he lied a lot and I was really manipulated. I've blocked and muted him but I still find stuff that his friends say and it's just so out of control.

She suggested sertraline and I said last time I was on sertraline I got crazy suicidal for no reason and ended up in hospital. She still wanted me to try it again and I've ended up with the exact same symptoms. 
A few things like this has happened at my doctors so I'm really reluctant to open up. Ever since I was a child I've thought that I'm in a book or film. Sometimes I'll forgot about it though. I'm in that state right now. I've just wrote down everything and I'm just going to hand her the paper instead of trying to explain. I've also wrote that I think people can hear my thoughts, that I want to hurt myself and that other people want to hurt or kill me, that I see things and hear things like the earth isn't real, that I think there are 2 of me. After reading it all back to myself I'm a bit worried that I might actually be ill. I'm even more worried that she'll just say okay and suggest CBT and a different anti depressant. I can't keep doing this. Is there anything I can say or do to try and get more help from her. I think this is happening to keep the 'audience entertained'. There is still a part of me that thinks these symptoms are obviously something going wrong in my head but more and more I think actually maybe it's all not real. Is there anything I can do.

21,"
First of all, sorry for the crappy formatting, I'm typing this on my phone. 

Obviously this issue isn't the only reason I am depressed. My depression is rooted deeply in my childhood and some past trauma that I've experienced in college, but what I'm going to describe next is something that has been eating me alive for weeks. I just didn't know where to unload it since I was scared people wouldn't take me seriously or say that it's not a thing that I should be upset about.
 
&amp;nbsp;

So here we go. Depression has always made it very difficult for me to enjoy things. I rarely enjoy something and my options are pretty limited since I can't be bothered by anything and nothing really holds my interest. So naturally, when I find something that I love, I cling to it and it becomes the most important thing in my life. But it happens very rarely. 

Three years ago I discovered this band that really resonated with me. Their songs, their vibe, their lyrics, everything spoke to me on such a deep level. I loved this band so much that my depression pretty much went into remission when I discovered them. I would listen to their music every single day. I joined online communities dedicated to this band, I listened to their entire discography countless times, watched all the live performances, watched all the interviews, read all the books about the band, collected bootlegs, rare pictures and so on. Basically this band became my entire life and I connected so well with their music I just couldn't be sad or depressed anymore. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now comes the real issue. A few weeks ago I started to slowly grow out of it. I realized I no longer enjoyed their music and I started to lose interest in my favorite band every day that went by. I know it's natural to sometimes change and grow out of things but for me, this was a disaster, because I was losing the only thing that made me happy for the past 3 years of my life. I desperately tried to cling to it but the more I tried to cling to the feeling, the more I realized it was gone. Their music no longer makes me happy, and sadly, it doesn't really make me feel anything at all anymore. I started being really depressed about it. I stopped eating and drinking, and my mental state worsened so much that I became physically sick. I would vomit every day, bawl my eyes out on the floor and cry myself to sleep every night. It became an obsession. Every time I am reminded of this band that I used to like, I start crying and I become violently sick, puking and having panic attacks. A few days ago Youtube recommended me one of their songs and when I saw the song pop up in my recommended I had an instant panic attack. Nowadays I wake up and this is my first thought: the memory of something that I once loved, and I no longer love. It saddens me so much that it's making me unable to function because I lost the only thing that used to make me happy. Food is bland, movies are boring, video games have lost their charm, even playing guitar has become torturous because it reminds me of the music that I desperately want to enjoy again. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

My question is, has anyone been in a similar position? How do I stop myself from self destructing because of this? It's making me so miserable I can barely function. It's the only thing I think about and I can't stop. Whenever I hear one of their songs on the radio, I start shaking and having panic attacks. Whenever I think about them, my feelings go crazy and I start crying instantly. It's taken such a huge toll on me that I simply can't live with this anymore.",11Mar2020,1

25,"I started going to therapy last month because I thought I was bipolar. I see my therapist once a week. I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality disorder and social anxiety and seasonal depression. Not on any medication. There is a DBT group therapy of 6 girls (19-22 years old) that started at the end of February. The first meet was the 26th and then last Wednesday. With another therapist who I’ve never met. I didn’t show up at the last two (they didn’t put me on the list though so it didn’t matter but this week they did).

I currently don’t have a job or any friends (haven’t had friends or a job in months, can’t keep either). And i sit in my house most of the time or take my dogs for walks sometimes (but that causes anxiety if it’s crowded on the walking trail).

I am supposed to see my therapist Thursday and group is tomorrow and I got a group text message as confirmation that group is tomorrow and there’s other girls replying. I never said anything. Someone is bringing their cat and snacks for the group.

I’m scared there might be people I went to school with there at group (I was bullied a lot and virtually had no friends all 4 years and sat alone at lunch a lot, I have RBF so I guess that doesn’t help and a strong fight or flight response and tend to come off rude when I feel uncomfortable and I shut down). There is someone in the group named Rachel and I knew 3 Rachel’s that went to that school that absolutely hated my guts for no reason and made my life hell.  Idk if it’s her because I don’t know the last name. 

I’m also scared they are going to judge me (you know the looks on peoples faces to know they are judging you, that certain look and then the way they look at others after looking at you or if they start whispering) and won’t like me for whatever reason.

I’m having massive anxiety thinking about it, my therapist thinks it would be good for me to try it out so we can use some of what they teach me there in our 1 on 1 sessions and so I can potential try to make friends. She also told me about meet me.com meet ups and I’m too scared to do that, I don’t trust people and I hate driving. Driving gives me massive anxiety.",11Mar2020,1
26,"Someone close to me has suffered from long term severe depression. Over the last few weeks, it escalated heavily. He stopped going to therapy, went through some hard times/triggers, and began planning suicide. He explicitly didn’t want intervention, and we exhausted every option available to us.

Cops came and he was admitted. I was not present. I haven’t been able to communicate since (due to hospital policy, but I’m guessing he is also still feeling betrayed by my choice).

He could be released as early as tomorrow. 

What’s the best way to respond to the situation once he’s out? I expect anger from him feeling betrayed, but want to still show support if appropriate. Tips and specific phrases are appreciated- particularly from anyone who may have been through either side of this situation. I have no idea how to navigate this situation or conversation.

I've tried to get into eighteen different therapists over the course of the last eight months. I'm either told: 

-they don't accept my insurance, even though they're listed on my insurance's website 

-they aren't taking new patients, even though my insurance's website and the therapist's personal says that they are

I don't think I would ever be able to go through with it. I've never even hit a person in my life. But I'm just so angered every time I think about her that my brain creates this very detailed narrative about exactly how I want to torture and kill her.

I am uncomfortable with the fact I am having these thoughts. Yet I still want to do it. But I don't think I ever could. As for now I'm staying as far away from her as I possibly can. 

I guess part of the reason I'm posting this is to ensure that I don't do it.

I have been to a therapist a couple times. A brief stint when I was younger, only made me feel worse. The last time I went, I got 5150'd for basically just saying the word ""suicide"" and then getting agitated at their protocol questions.

35,"I was convinced this was a physical issue and in a way, im still stuck on that line of thought as i don't think there's any mental health condition that causes you to feel this way, especially in a sudden way like it keeps happening to me; still i think it's worth asking here. 
Basically, sometimes i suddenly feel euphoric for no reason: it's not just in my mind; it coats my entire body like a warm blanket, every movement is pure ecstasy and simply being alive and breathing air in and out is pleasure. Worrying thoughts fade in the background and life doesn't feel serious anymore. It's like taking a break and allowing yourself to just..exist and soak in those blissful sensations. My sense of hunger disappears and sometimes i hallucinate smells; like for example, drops of rain on leaves and grass; it's hard to describe as usually my senses mix into one and those drops suddenly turn into full blown mental images; a huge park surrounded by nature, a peaceful beach on a stormy day; what i see it's also what my hands, nose and ears can feel. It's intense. 
But obviously it doesn't stops there. 
After the initial phase, my desires and thoughts get all weird: i begin to crave strange things, such as chewing on rubber, or have thoughts about doing something that i enjoy but that's completely out of place in that moment; for example, it's 4AM right now and not only i can't even close my eyes, but i feel like jumping out of bed, turn on my TV, play something, start looking for things to sell, put things in order, have three cups of black tea, watch youtube videos and yes, all at the same time. I have done things like these before and it was ridiculous to say the least but it felt so right. 
This can get terribly uncomfortable; and that's when it takes a turn for the worst; i begin to feel deep feelings of despair and euphoria; i both feel like ending myself and celebrating life; i start thinking about giving up and on the other side im extremely optimistic and hopeful about the next things im going to do. And it just goes on and on. Sleeping like this is impossible. And i have no idea what causes it or how to stop it. I know it doesn't have anything to do with being bipolar; mood disorders do not work like this; manic or depressive states persist for days and weeks; this is something that comes and goes and doesn't really feel like any of those two.

37,"I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid or not but

I have a suspicion that my therapist (a psychologist, NOT a psychiatrist) is way too eager to give me pills.

I'm already taking risperidone, and it made some things on my body go a little whack, so she recommended just taking half of it. I still kinda feel the side effects, but not as much.

Thing is, after a few more sessions, she said the risperidone itself was not enough, and wrote me a prescription for another antidepressant.

The thing that made me see red flags are these:

* The prescription is on her husband's name (her husband is a psychiatrist. She is not)
* She faked her husband's signature in the prescription 
* She claims there are absolutely none of the side effects to this pill ( Fluoxetine aka prozac)

My sister is very against this (but she's always been the kind of people who think only they can get sick, and if others do, they are faking it. So her input is kinda....ignored) 

I'm very nervous about this, she is the only therapist I can afford.

38,"tl;dr at bottom because i really need some advice. hoping someone can help... 

i’m 17 and will be going to college soon but i feel like my life is falling apart. what makes this worse is that the one person i want and desperately need support from is my mom... who has never shown interest in my personal life for as long as i can remember.
she isn’t even interested in my education. my entire life she has not set educational expectations for me and i think i’ve suffered because of this. 
my mom also has depression, ADD, and some past anxiety, as far as i know. i managed to receive all three of these lovely, totally not life ruining gifts from her. she also has never really worked in depth on these mental health issues (skips her antidepressants, only takes her ritalin as needed), making her struggle even more with parenting, especially with her being single.

i didn’t notice for a while but my mom’s lack of  involvement with me has really affected me. i’m so used to rejection from her when seeking help or affection, or her just blatantly ignoring me, or barely participating in conversation, that i’m unbelievably insecure and vulnerable around her. i never feel so strongly negative and unloved unless i’m around her. 
she doesn’t care if i eat, or sleep. doesn’t care how work or school goes. doesn’t care about my accomplishments, personal or educational. 

we have had months of family therapy, no results. even with me, begging for her to consider my emotions, she doesn’t last more than a few days being considerate of me. when this happens, she will be affectionate and caring for a short period of time, and even then it feels foreign and makes me even more sad because 1) i had to express that i feel unloved for this to even happen and 2) i know it’s only temporary. it’s over when she gets annoyed with me simply trying to confide in her and i can’t argue with her so i just have to leave and go to my room. i explain things calmly and rationally and she ends up freaking out at me no matter what. i never know which side of her i’m going to get on a given day and it’s so anxiety inducing. 
i don’t know what to do anymore. i feel like she won’t ever change and i’ll remain struggling to connect with her. i’m aware my situation could be MUCH worse but this up and down relationship is really taking a toll on my mental health. 

tl;dr my single &amp; mentally ill mother doesn’t listen when i have conversations with her unless it’s to lecture me for no reason or tell me i’m bothering her. she’s emotionally distant and barely involved in my life no matter how hard i try to fix our relationship. i’m desperate for options.",11Mar2020,1

Observing my bodily sensations or signatures and being present with them is my way of noticing how I feel.

I will give you an analogy of what my problem is. When we read books we come across words for different tastes. Sour, bitter etc.. But I can never know what it is bitter and sour until I taste food items that are sour or bitter.. We learn such things through our senses. 

So there is a difference between a taste when it is an abstract idea Vs a concrete and real experience.

Im 20 and rn I work 8-4:30 every week ( idk if that matters), I've always been quite around everyone especially people I've just met recently, I don't have very many people I consider friends and the only time I ever really go out with them is on a Friday sometimes.

Because of my quietness I've never really had very many people I considered close to me, I've tried to grow custom to it but back in high school I went through a bad depression which made it worse to try and meet people. 
Nowadays I spend most of my week in a loop of work and home, I've kinda gotten used to it but recently I've noticed that its been easier for me to get into a sad mood. I've never really shown much emotion to people around me but now I noticed if one negative thing happens to me I just go into my head and start thinking negative things about myself. And for some random moments of my day honestly just for like a dream like I'm not even there, I've honestly doubted my reality multiple times and wondered what I'm doing any of this for. Today I had one of those moments and its been bothering me for a long time along with a lot of other thoughts I've had. 
I've also (I know this sounds like a classic emo quote) have had a hard time feeling joy and confidence in myself, I've tried to dress sharper whenever I go out but there's no point if I'm not confident.

53,"I’m Will, and I suffer from Avoidant Personality Disorder.

I’m just looking for a place to anonymously share what I’m going through at the moment. Hopefully I’ve come to the right place.

I understand that AvPD is poorly understood to some degree because those who suffer from AvPD can be so reluctant to speak about it. In view of that, I hope that anyone who wants to understand more about AvPD might find something of value in the account I’m about to give.

It was only a few days ago that I was told my diagnosis, after the two therapists I’d worked with in the past refused to tell me what it was. According to them, it was better I didn’t know. Well, you know, I strongly disagree with that. In fact, I think a strong case could be made that it was harmful not to disclose my diagnosis, but I digress.

So my whole life I think I’m a normal person who just struggles with depression and social anxiety. I think I’m capable of success; that’s what everyone always told me. Growing up, I was praised for my intelligence and was told I’d have a bright future.

Well, I’m not here to tell my whole life story, but I got myself a family now, and I love them literally more than life itself. On the whole, I would say that I’ve regretted most of my life, but not when it comes to them. I’m really, really incredibly grateful for my wife, stepson (who calls me “daddy” and who I look on as my own), and daughter.

Don’t ask me how I pulled it off; that’s a long story, but the bottom line is I’m responsible for all this, now.

That’d be great, if only I were a responsible person. I’m not. I wish I were, but the fact is, I don’t seem to be capable of it. I ought to be capable; by all outward appearances, there’s no reason I can’t be responsible. And, since I genuinely want to be, I seem to fool everyone (including myself) into believing that I will be. But, sadly, I’m really not very responsible about anything - except my kids. By the grace of God, I believe I’ve been spared from screwing that up in any major way.

It really sucks that I was never told about my condition, and that the people who claimed to love me most never really knew me well enough to see what was going on inside. I really thought I could get myself a career or something, have a family, you know, and a pretty decent life. You know, like I’d just avoid my way into an awesome job, cause I’m so smart and I have such a bright future etc.
Apply for a job? Ha! I’m above that. People know I’m good at stuff. I mean, they know that I would be good at stuff, if I did stuff. In theory, I’m basically great at anything once I’ve learned it. So, I’ll just sit around all day, playing video games and spending a frankly ridiculous amount of time cooking each meal and snack, and eventually, my dream job will fall into my lap! Or maybe, without ever publishing any of my work, I’ll become a writer or podcaster! I mean, it wasn’t spelled out in my head like that, but subconsciously, I really was that delusional. I had to have those delusions; what else was I gonna do? Be honest with myself that, although I present myself like a hard-working breadwinning family man, the reality is that it takes me a full month of preparation and a few shots of Fireball to work up the courage to submit a single job application?

Well, that’s what I’m trying right now, and that’s why I’m writing this. Being honest with myself: that’s got to be part of healing, right? It’s a start, I hope.

Anyways, my present crisis is all about my family. We needed more income, you see. My shitty job wasn’t paying enough for my wife to stay home with the children until the youngest is at least 4 years old, which is something I insist upon doing.

So, now I’ve got myself this job in... well, what’s the WORST possible kind of job you could possibly imagine for someone with Avoidant Personality Disorder? Yes, you’ve guessed it: sales! What better way to ensure that your crippling fear of rejection hits you where it hurts the most?

So, yes, I’ve got AvPD, and I’ve got a job in sales, which is to say, I’m broke as a joke. Been living parasitically off my in-laws’ credit card, mostly. My parents help pay the bills. The in-laws don’t seem to mind it too awfully much; evidently they’re not worried about the money as long as it’s for things we need, and I reckon they buy my optimistic narrative (which I also believed, until today) that I’ll start making that ***biiiiiiiig money*** pretty much any day now. Either they buy that narrative, or they just don’t care much about all that money, and I find the latter more difficult to believe. Either way, I care a great deal about the money, in that I loathe myself for having to use their money to support my own family.

But that situation won’t last forever, nor would I allow it to. I won’t have it that way much longer. I’m too ashamed of the parasitism. I don’t want to be a parasite, and besides, if I live the life of a parasite, how could I ever possibly hope to be a good father to my children? No, better to fall into destitution than to become a successful career parasite.

So, yeah, that’s my story. This month’s bills are paid; as for next month, who knows where I’ll be. I just wanted to put that out there for the world to see, you know? It was like a compulsion, because nobody in my life sees it.",11Mar2020,1

55,"My story. 
This will be a bit long winded but I don’t want to cut anything it of it.

So I am a 28 year old male. As a child I was homeschooled and never really left the house except for a weekly shopping trip and church. My abuser was my older brother who took advantage of me when I was still a very young teen. My parents found out what was going on when he assaulted 2 girls that where living with us part time. Despite knowing everything they hid me from the court and got him off with just a single counseling session for the assault.  

Later in my life my brother who I still loved at that point started dating a girl and got very attached. My brother was my only friend for many years so this was traumatic for me. They both picked on me the whole time they dated till he eventually moved in with her. His leaving me was absolutely devastating to a young teen. I became suicidal and went to the woods with a gun there I made the decision to never feel again. It was surprisingly easy to just shut off and put life on cruise control for the next decade. 

Jump forward to when I am in my 20s still living at home working a dead end job 20 hours a week. There I had met my first real friend. I had 0 interest in any relationship and he was a complete sociopath. So basically we where perfect best friends. After he had 4 or 5 girlfriends I finally decided I liked one of them. 

Her name was Ashley and I actually felt something for her. My first real human connection in so many years. Long story short we became really close friends and hung out all the time. There was nothing sexual as I wouldn’t do that to my friend but emotionally we where in a weird 3 way relationship she called a V. 

She had been sexually abused by her father and completely understood why I so introverted. We never got into the details of our past but there was a deep healing connection.

Naturally when things are going well shit has to happen. Both her and my mother where diagnosed with cancer within a month of each other. My mother has had over 20 surgeries now with multiple chemo sessions. Ashley was not so lucky as hers entered stage 4 within the first year. I will spare the details but long story short I spent a lot of time at her bedside with my friend. When she was at home I would come over and spend days or weeks just hanging out with them. Watching someone in so much pain they forget who you are and in a constant hallucinations is not fun. 

When she eventually died the pain was to much and I shut off again. I didn’t even go to the funeral because I knew what the people there had done to her.

From there my depression was soo deep I was beyond just wanting to die. I wanted others to feel what I had been feeling for so long I wanted to force that pain on them. I knew it would kill my parents and I didn’t want to be responsible for that so I waited. 

Thankfully since then my mental health has improved a lot. My outlook on life changed and I started looking at finding my own measure of happiness. I started by moving out into a home I bought and transferring to another facility where I could start fresh. 

These where the best decisions I have ever made. There I met my girlfriend who is the love of my life. The first day I met her she reminded me of Ashley so much I had to excuse myself. We started dating 6 months ago after I promoted to a salaried position at yet a different facility.

Her story 
If you have read this far thank you for listening.

So her history is for worse than mine and will be far more paraphrased.

Her father physically abused her and actually tried to kill her on 2 occasions as a child. She was raped at 15 or 16 by her then boyfriend who stole her virginity.

Her mother took her and left the state after that to protect her from her father. They moved in with family and she was repeatedly raped by a family member in that house. After that I don’t know many of the details but I do know she was in several abusive relationships. She has been with atleast 20 different men and was handed around by a particular abusive older male.
 
She went the opposite way I did. Where I had shut down and hid from the world she became very open with sex and was seeking validation from everyone.

Our story 

When we met she had just left a family job that was emotional abusive. She was days from being homeless because they didn’t pay her and wouldn’t help her in any way. Of course I didn’t know any of this till after we had been dating for awhile. 

Our first date was absolutely amazing. Neither of us even knew if it was a date or not when it started but I had went all out. I took her to a little known tiger sanctuary where I got us the most expensive all access feed the tigers passes. As someone who had never been on a date before it was very awkward for the both of us. I don’t know how to touch someone so we just never touched the entire day. The day had started at like 9 am but we hung out till it was late at night. We just talked and talked about everything in our lives. 

From there we we hung out every day we both shared off. I had to leave for 4 weeks of out of state training but each weekend I came back and spent it with her. By date 3 we started touching and by date 6 she had slept over no sex just cuddling. Some point after date 8 we had our first kiss as I was leaving her place to get back to my training.

We had sex for the first time a week or so later. She knew it was my first time and she was very understanding about the whole thing. Since then we have been incredibly close and spend every second we can spare together. The shared traumas and past lack of intimacy have created a deep bond well beyond anything either of us have ever experienced. We just had our 6 month anniversary and I fully intend to marry this girl in a year or two.

Now that the back story’s are out of the way my question is how do I help her deal with her rawer emotions. She is studying psychology and it has been dragging a lot of older trauma as well as still dealing with more recent events. I am several years older than her and have more or less made peace with with my demons. Hers however are still raw and I don’t know how to help her through them. 

Is there anyone here who can maybe share how they where able to get past similar events ?

She has very vivid dreams of the past will they go away ?

She is having second though about getting into mental health counseling because of the course material she is doing. Is this a bad field for a trauma victim to be in ? I hate to see her quit now that she is almost done with her master’s degree.

Any thoughts on what I can do for her would be appreciated. I’m always there when she lets me know something is wrong but she doesn’t let me see what has her upset all the time.",11Mar2020,1
56,"Hi, I'm 14 and I wanted to come here to talk about something.

Sometimes I will be having a really fun time and all of a sudden something in my brain clicks. Something makes me realise that all this laughter and happiness is not normal and just a facade to hide reality. I think about how society gives us this perspective of what happy is and that we need to be it, but in reality life just isn't as easy as that.

I used to have depression a couple years ago, and I kind of just switched off my emotions. I'm still working on them and have almost healed fully, but I dont know what is wrong with me.",11Mar2020,1
57,"This weekend I stayed awake for 72 hours and had no problem with it. I didn’t feel sleepy at all. Keep in mind I caught a cold during this time. But something in my mind broke, I don’t know what’s happening. On the third day of staying awake, everything felt so surreal. It felt like when you’re in a dream and you’re trying to tell people stuff but they give you a weird unrelated response or don’t hear you at all. I couldn’t tell if I was speaking words out loud or if I was just thinking them. 

What’s weird is everything went so well. I accidentally told a ton of people my true thoughts about them and told a friend my deepest darkest issues. It’s like it was being willed out of me. I never talk about my issues cause it always self sabotages. What’s weird is people were concerned and things were going how I’d always hoped. It was like i was in complete control? Maybe it’s mere coincidence? Either way, it was surreal as hell. I was also hallucinating a little, and definitely had a fever. 

Since then, I’ve gotten rest and into my normal routine, but nothing is the same. Nothing feels real. I still feel like I’m in a dream. And don’t get me wrong, it’s not necessarily bad. I just feel like I’m doing everything out of instinct. I’m not fully processing everything the way I usually do. I’m just blissfully ignorant and benefitting from the situation. 

Prior to this weekend, I’ve been extremely depressed and sad. I’m not sure I had depression or anything but I was suicidal as hell and so aware of everything. I hated myself and who I was. I felt trapped and unworthy of love. It was almost comforting to be there. it sucked but it was all i knew since summer. I assume it was just due to the winter. 

Possible explanations? Maybe the warm weather is just making me less sad and this is normal. I don’t know if i dislike it but it’s so different and I feel on top of the world and like nothing matters??? If you are experiencing anything similar or have any way to explain it i’d very much appreciate it. 

TL;DR: I stayed up for 3 days straight, caught a cold, and after that, everything has that weird feeling and uncanny energy of a dream. Nothing feels real. Why?",11Mar2020,1

60,"Probably going to sound crazy, but after years of childhood trauma and still continued suffering I have come to a conclusion (that I've thought of for a very long time)

&amp;#x200B;

It only makes sense (to me) that my soul is from a fallen angel from hell. Implanted in this human body, sent to form in a horrible woman. I think the portal from hell opened and myself was implanted into whatever sperm reached her first. I'm only embarrassed about comparing myself to an angel, that sounds super conceited, but they are angels who were ""expelled"" from hell. Who knows what sins I committed in the holy life to throw me into the turmoil that is my human life? But clearly I have some part of the devil in me; and I was formed to wreak havoc on this earth from my building up resentment. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be suicidal, well I am to a certain extent. I'm feeling this sadness to turn into anger. When I die I will dethrone God himself and strangle him with my bare hands for all the pain he's put me through. I hate God, and no one else. This is the only person I have genuine hate for. I do not hate my family, they are only sad junkies. All my rage has burnt out for them and now I know the true source of my pain. 

And there is someone in my mind playing some sort of role. My mother had a miscarriage before me, and I was born premature a year later (another sign of my mistaken existence) and I genuinely believe They (my would be sibling) stayed in her somehow so they could implant himself into my head and help me realize these things. They have created horrible conflict in me at the same time, as we are opposite genders. So I firmly believe I have half the mind of a woman and half of a man and I truly do not feel like my own gender (Not interested in transitioning and would not consider myself dysphoric, there are only 2 souls inhabiting this sad vessel)

I'm really going off here, I've had these thoughts forming in my head for years and have never told anyone. I hate this god forsaken life and see no end to my misery.",11Mar2020,1

Like for example I keep saying I have a favorite superhero, but then change like a few moments later or even later on. It always makes my head hurt and spin. Then I last out in emotions and anger.

65,"I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and mild depression that I’ve managed without meds for almost a decade. I use my five free therapy sessions through my work health plan each year to talk through any situational issues. I can’t afford ongoing therapy. And they’re so busy I can’t see anyone for almost a month or get a phone appointment for two weeks. Normally everything is fine but I’ve been dealing with a lot lately and I’m starting to spiral. Here is a recap, I just need to get it all out.

There were two deaths in my family around the holidays and in January that were unexpected and tough. No one super close to me but shocking and made me consider my parents’ mortality which is hard. I also have issues with the lack of sunlight in the winter and am generally more depressed then. In February I had an elective sterilization which I’m very happy about as my constant pregnancy stress is gone for good. But there was a lot of stress leading up to it due to time off work and getting FMLA set up, anxiety about going under general anesthesia, and that anxiety causing high blood pressure. I also had car problems at the same time but luckily that ended up being no big deal. The surgery and recovery went well but I’ve been billed for the surgery like I had a hysterectomy or something when this is supposed to be 100% covered by my insurance. I prepared and asked every question under the sun to make sure this very issue didn’t happen and it still did. I’m not prepared to pay my $5,200 out of packet max and playing middle man over a coding issue is really wearing on me. I’m concerned about draining my HSA in the middle of a coronavirus pandemic and I don’t want to take out a 401K loan during this stock market crisis. I’m also concerned about these payment options as we want to sell our house and buy later this year and I don’t want a new loan or issue reflecting on my credit report. The benefit team also lost my paperwork from my doctor so I’m dealing with that. And I’m also waiting to hear back on our taxes which always raises my anxiety as we owe every year. 

Back to the stock market, this is a huge trigger for me as I was laid off in 2009 and incurred a lot of financial hardship from it for years. I’m just finally in a good place with my credit score. My company also had a massive layoff in 2015 that I survived but I had multiple panic attacks and was almost hospitalized during that time. I’m starting to feel like that again. My company is doing well but if we hit a recession again who knows. I am the breadwinner and we cannot survive for more than six months without me working. My husband is in a trade and goes into people’s homes everyday. I’m concerned he might get sick and I’m concerned he might lose his job if people stop remodeling their homes. I get sick time and can work from home but he can’t. While I can cover our bills for awhile a long term layoff for him would be hard. We both have college degrees but if the economy is crap it’ll be hard to find jobs. All of this keeps me up at night. 

We have an old house my husband wants out of but I don’t feel now is the time to be making big financial decisions. Refinancing doesn’t make sense as our rate was low already and we want to move within a year. I’m nervous about ending up under water at a new house when that will never happen with our current house. I’m also nervous about a major issue happening at our current house that we can’t afford and him resenting me for it. Our plumbing is old and we’ve had to replace various sections of pipe. There’s also the stress of a hot market and possibly being homeless if something falls through out of order. We have a big dog and can’t just go rent anywhere.

I have a demanding job that I love but all travel has been cancelled causing me to have to work late nights and early mornings to meet with overseas teams since I can’t do it in person during my trips. I’m not getting enough sleep which can impact my immune system. I also love traveling and my US trips have been cancelled too so depression is creeping in as I feel I have nothing to look forward to. We want to plan a vacation for fall but I’m concerned about having to cancel and losing money if this doesn’t blow over. My husband has a trip planned with friends this weekend but he came home tonight with a cough and 100.5 fever. I had a panic attack. He called a nurse and she told him to stay home tomorrow but not panic about coronavirus as neither of us have been around anyone who is sick or was in a high risk country. But we’ve been out in public in large crowds and who knows who has it. I’m terrified he has it, for his own health, my health, and the people we’ve been around in the past week. Some are 60+ and have health issues. The nurse told me to go to work as normal and I need to as I’m busy but I’m scared to pass it to someone if I’m carrying it. He still wants to go on the trip if his fever is gone by then but I’m terrified he’ll be quarantined out of state and then what? If they cancel the trip they get nothing so no one wants to cancel.

This is a lot, sorry for the word vomit. I’m overwhelmed, I can’t sleep, and I have no appetite. I’m crying uncontrollably as I type this. I feel like my life is falling apart. I need to keep going at work in case I get sick, I’m the only one who does my job and it needs to be in a good place if I’m gone. The uncertainty of all this is killing me. My husband only told his boss about being sick and doesn’t want other people to know yet so I can’t talk about that with anyone. I also can’t talk about my surgery costs with anyone as we kept that quiet due to people not accepting our decision to not have kids. I don’t know what I’m looking for here, I guess just a virtual hug and some understanding since I can’t hug my husband right now and I want to respect that he has his own stress to deal with so I’m trying not to pile it on him. I’m not at risk of hurting myself, but if he goes on the trip I may stay with a friend or at a hotel for a night or two as I don’t want to be alone with guns in the house. Hopefully I can see a therapist soon. Maybe it’s time to get an as needed prescription for Benzos or something. Thanks for listening.",11Mar2020,1
66,"My boyfriend dumped me after a massive argument (we were both in the wrong and I wanted to fix things and he didn’t) and it spiraled into me bursting into my mom’s room after work and sobbing hysterically about how I have no one and how I want to die because I’m tired of being sad. I went into detail about things that were going on in our relationship (like the fact that he thought I should have to win him back after arguing) and she told me that I deserved better than exhausting myself trying to be worthy for someone who couldn’t see my worth, and that I should never have to apologize for being myself and that I should never settle",11Mar2020,1

68,"My boyfriend dumped me after a massive argument today. We were both shitty to each other, and I wanted to fix things and he didn’t. This led to me bursting into my mom’s room after work sobbing hysterically and letting her read the texts. At first she sided with him but after reading something he sent along the lines of “you should have to win me back in order for me to forgive you,” she got really angry and told me to never settle for someone who didn’t see my worth, to never apologize for being myself, and to be proud of the person I’ve become, even if I’m still not where I want to be. I think it’s the nicest speech my mom has ever given me. Anyway, it prompted me to admit to her that I’ve felt suicidal and extremely depressed for the better part of four years and she cried and urged me to get help. I told her I wanted help and tomorrow she’s going to help me find a therapist.

After four years of waking up feeling sad or empty or unmotivated, I finally have a way out of those feelings that doesn’t involve me ending my life. I want to be hopeful for the future but I’m scared that I won’t recognize the person I’ll become. Getting help is scary. I’m doing this alone, with no friends, no one to support me. My mom and dad are the only ones who know. I’m not planning on telling the rest of my family. I’m scared. I’m hopeful. I’m tired. I’m ready to stop being sad constantly.",11Mar2020,1

It’s all a mental thing for me and it really brings me down if I’m going out or doing anything outside my home.

I look and there are no birds around. 

And then when I drive, I keep the windows rolled down, I can still hear the birds singing as if from the same distance, as if from outside. I hear it at night too, like morning birds singing but in the dead of night.

At the moment, I’m really struggling with my mental health, especially regarding isolation &amp; loneliness. I’ve never had any friends - I find it really difficult to make friends &amp; I often find that if I don’t make the first move &amp; initiate the conversations, they don’t happen. I’m not included in others’ plans &amp; I’m always worried I’m going to be forgotten, excluded or even ghosted. I’ve been in 4 relationships, 1 of which was for 7 years &amp; was emotionally abusive (&amp; physical on 2 occasions) &amp; all of these, except the current one, have been toxic &amp; very unhealthy. My boyfriend also struggles with his mental health &amp; I don’t want to rely on him too much for comfort as I know he’s finding life hard, too. 

How do I stop being so insecure? I’m always clingy &amp; needy. I’m often irrational &amp; I have a tendency to overreact. How do I make friends? Or keep friendships? I’m convinced nobody will make an effort with me unless I contact them first. Where do I go to meet people? I need somebody to talk to, other than my boyfriend as I don’t want to overwhelm him &amp; he has his own worries. Who can I talk to? 

I’ve been referred to a Psychiatrist but it’s a 4-6 week wait (after years &amp; years of struggling, begging for help &amp; being messed around) &amp; I have nobody to talk to in that time frame. 

My lack of friends &amp; my loneliness, as a result, are causing me to feel worthless &amp; as if people wouldn’t care if I wasn’t here anymore. 

No medical professionals will take me seriously, my family don’t understand &amp; I’m completely lost as to what to do. 

Any suggestions are massively appreciated. 

TL;DR 
Been surrounded by negativity my whole life. Wanting to meet people, make friends &amp; keep them &amp; try to combat loneliness, to help improve my mental health. Looking for suggestions. 

Thank you all, in advance.",11Mar2020,1
75,"I've been doing a lot of self reflecting lately.. you know thinking of who I used to be and who I am now. Things I should have done instead of what I did back then. Like choices I should have made but didn't make and later on made. Let me explain..
In 2017-2018 I hit a very personal rock bottom, I went through a very public very bad breakup, when I wanted help everyone shut me out or didn't care, I was failing classes left and right, an addict, family life was dramatic etc. I went through alot of bs by myself and learned how to take care of myself and do everything BY MYSELF but doing everything by myself turned into me making bad decisions and hurting people I didn't ever wanna hurt and most importantly I hurt myself. Now I'm 20 years old, in a very good state of mind (sorta, kinda) I have a boyfriend I love more than I love anything in this god forsaken world, have everything and I get help from people but I hate asking for it because again, in used to taking care of myself.
I think my biggest issue is...I don't know how to put my guard down or let someone else take care of me, I let my boyfriend of course because well duhh that's my boyfriend of course I'm gonna need his help but theres some things I just don't ask for help with and probably should, I don't know how to stop  getting defensive, I'm scared honestly.. I have so many good things in my life and I'm terrified one day all these good things will go down the toilet. I'm almost 3 years sober, I'm in love- head over heels in love! My family is always hit or miss but I love them. 

But I think my biggest fear is- I fear getting hurt because I've always been hurt, cheated on, lied to, used, betrayed, etc I've had my heart feel like it was ripped out of my chest thrown at wall, stuck there plopped on the ground and like someone just stomped on it to pieces.(that was dark, sorry) but that's how it's felt before and I never wanna feel that useless or in pain again, I just can't. I can't go through another breakup or any type of pain like that again and my boyfriend and I have been together for what feels like forever and I've known him for Years, this man is my best friend and I'm nothing without him, he's my purpose and the man I plan on marrying one day. I know he's never leave me or cheat or lie but when you have a piece of shit scum of the earth lying bastard fake ass raggedy ass hoe ass ex like mine, you'd understand.

82,"Brief background:  DH is a life long sufferer of health anxiety.  It’s paralyzing and he becomes utterly sick and dysfunctional.  He’s been taking Zoloft for about 7 years and occasionally sees a therapist.  Long story short, he stopped his meds (unbeknownst to me) about 7 months ago.  He’s been meditating and being mindful and thought he was “better”.  Fast forward to first week in January. He went for a routine physical and his doc told him he wanted him to see a urologist because his PSA level was borderline.   Well,  since then, it’s spiraled into a living nightmare.   As his spouse, I’ve been dealing with this, and I just can’t reach him.  He’s barely able to go to work, etc. 
My question is, there are times that I think I need to get him some serious help but am at a loss.  HIS therapist is so unhelpful. She has, I believe encouraged him not to go back on meds.  She is a CBT psychologist.   Should I find a psychiatrist? Should I try to get him hospitalized?  It’s going on 3 months and he’s basically been in fight or flight mode all this time and it’s killing him and our family.  
What kind of doc should I find?

95,"i’ve always had issues with my mental health. (i’m 17f) specifically with anxiety, even since i was a little kid i would have at least mild anxiety symptoms. in middle school i remembered it taking a large dip and my anxiety got really really bad. that’s when dissociation started happening. but it would only be for a small period of time (a few seconds, honestly) and every couple months. and then when i reached high school it would become every month and for longer. and then in november of last year (nov 2019) it suddenly took a large drop. i was taking a trip across country and the entire three day trip i couldn’t stop dissociating. there was only abt a five minute period of one day where i didn’t dissociate. (i get nervous on planes and i think my anxiety set it off? i don’t know. i have a problem with breaking routine, it really sets off my anxiety, and i think bc i missed school for this trip and was worried about catching up i had a hard time. i honestly don’t know.) 
since that trip there is little time where i’m not disconnected from reality. i went to therapy and the therapist also diagnosed me as depressed (as well as my other various issues lol), which i didn’t think i was. but i’m pretty sure that comes from the fact that this year my i never see my best friends because they’re all in a very advanced program at my school where they all take the same classes, and i’m just in honors/ap.

dissociation comes from trauma. everything i read says that. i had a great childhood and a great middle school life and aside from the mental stuff, my high school life is good too. i don’t have any traumatic events in my life. the most sad thing that happened to me is that all my four siblings left my household abt the same time (they’re all ~10 years older than me) and i guess that could have made me lonely? i don’t know. it’s not traumatic.

96,"Hi There

I'm 33 about to turn 34 and have PTSD, OCD, anxiety, and depression. My symptoms are quite low in severity compared to when I was younger. I have a good job and life overall and am 90% functional other than I take the odd mental health day to stay level and take Lexapro. 

Currently I do not feel ready to have kids, and am somewhat unsure whether I want to have them at all. One of my main reasons for not wanting to have them are that I don't want to give this illness to my children (my father and grandfather had it, grandfather died to suicide, dad tried many times then died early from cancer). Other than that I am not reallllly a kid person, but I do think I could handle having one, perhaps in my later thirties, but I also question if I could take on the added stress of sleep deprivation and not having the alone time I need to stay sane. 

My main problem right now is just my obsession over it. The obsession itself about whether to lose my girlfriend who really wants kids sometime in the next couple of years, who would indeed have to leave me if I decided I didn't want them. As well as obsessing about maybe missing my chance as having them with her might be my only one. I am just as worried about getting old and not having kids as I am about having them. I feel very old right now and feel like I would be judged if I had a kid in my late thirties or early forties (even though my aunt was forty when she had her last child and he's a doctor). Everyone in my family is getting married and having kids and I feel like a loser not doing it, but I question if it's for me. 

In any case my biggest issue right now is the obsession itself which is eating up way too much brain power and I was hoping for some insight in order to get this monkey off my back. I've had OCD long enough to recognize obsession for what it is now, in that it's something that doesn't have direct relation to the thing you are actually worried about, but this one has gone on for some years now and intensified and I can't seem to shake it.

Any advice would be great. Thanks.",11Mar2020,1
97,"Hi all,

So, I've always struggled with anxiety and occasionally depression (caused by trauma). However, for the past few years I've also struggled to THINK!

I used to be very motivated and was also a great thinker, constantly coming up with new ideas and also enjoyed problem solving. I excelled at university, too. My first job was awful, which is partly what I think may be the cause of this. I was shouted at by my manager for small mistakes since the first week. Told I was ridiculous, that I was costing the company money etc. My counsellor highlighted that I seem to have a dear for failure which I completely agree with.

Now, when I have a problem, I am instantly overwhelmed, as if a cloud has just floated across my brain, I struggle to think! This has led me to just ignoring problems as I'd rather not try. I feel this has also made me more lazy as I just don't think of solutions anymore because I can't be bothered.

I've also just been made redundant and I don't know what to do. 

What is wrong with me!? I want the old confident, critical thinking me back!

Any advice would be HUGELY appreciated!

TLDR: I struggle to think of solutions or come up with new ideas (brain fog?) and get overwhelmed easily when faced with challenges.",11Mar2020,1
98,"Hi. I'm sorry if this post doesn't seem to serve a purpose at this point I really don't know why I'm writing it but I really want to hear from someone who might know what exactly it is I'm dealing with. 

I'm currently 25 years old. When I was 4 I was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and suffered through it until I entered remission when I was 8. It was horrific for everyone in my family except me, really, as I didn't know any better and saw the constant hospital stays and doctor visits as just being what I had to do. For a long time growing up after entering remission, I saw it as a good thing that I got it when I did because of that--I didn't know any better and it would have been worse were I an adult. 

Throughout my sickness I was homeschooled. My only social interaction for the first 8 years of my life was with my parents and doctors. When I was well enough to go to public school and actually interact with kids my age, I loved it. I felt like I got along with everyone and had a lot of friends.

But I didn't. With every year that went by as I grew up, I realized more and more that I was actually really awkward. I said the wrong things. I embarrassed myself constantly. I felt an immense amount of empathy for the other kids to the point where all of my social interaction became ""how do I act to have this person not hate me and think I'm an embarrassing, annoying person."" This realization was a snowball effect that carried on and has carried on for literally my entire life. Every year I went up in school I became more and more withdrawn and afraid to talk to people, culminating in my senior year of high school having two friends that I could speak to without overthinking every single word and thought. They would invite me to go places and I'd turn them down almost as a rule because of my fear of embarrassment and not knowing what to say when others were present, and my behavior and refusal to do a lot of things ended up forcing us to drift apart.

While this was going on I retreated into my bedroom and the computer/internet, playing video games and meeting new people that way, which I figure was easier for me because of the anonymity and the thought that everyone I was talking to has a shared interest in the game/games in general. I spent years and years telling myself that eventually I'd get over this mindset and fearfulness, that it was just a part/phase of being young and eventually I would ""wake up"" one day and be able to function as a  human being with a drive to go out into the world, find a job, make money, and be normal.

But that day still hasn't come. I'm 25 years old and still living with my mom, cramped in a tiny bedroom and spending most of my time online and playing video games. I'm lucky to have a small group of friends that I can comfortably spend time with and a long distance SO, but I just don't know if I'm ever going to be able to course correct myself. I struggle with the thoughts that I'm just lazy and need to force myself to get out there, but going to any public space other than the grocery store or restaurant within walking distance of my house fills me with a dread and my mind instantly shuts down the idea as being something that I won't enjoy and dangerous on top of it.

I think the problem is that I'm actually happy with living the way I do, but I know I can't live like this forever and thus the cycle repeats itself of me hating the way I feel. I'm ashamed of living the way I do when my friends and SO are working and have no problem going out places. I'm ashamed that I'm complacent and don't want things to change, but it's an impossibility.

Money is extremely tight at the moment. My mom doesn't work and receives money from my father's (who passed away in 2018, which was its own hell) retirement. At this point all I'm doing is waiting for my SO to reach a more stable living situation and planning on moving in with them, but that won't fix any of my motivational issues. I'm scared of being a leech and driving them away. I'm terrified that even if I get a job it wouldn't be enough to pull my own weight in the relationship. These are concerns I've voiced to them, and they've assured me it isn't the case, but I literally cannot stop thinking them whenever the subject comes up; like everything else it's easy to just avoid it and distract myself with a game or TV show.

 Adding onto my fears that I'm just lazy and there's nothing wrong with me, most of the people my mom's side of the family have varying degrees of depression and suffered from panic attacks before they got medicated. I've seen one of these attacks, and have never experienced anything that severe. The only thing I can compare it to is that sometimes I'll feel a general malaise and become overwhelmed by emotion and fear for my future which usually causes me to sob for 10-20 minutes, but these are pretty few and far between. For the most part, when I'm not thinking about my problems, I'm pretty optimistic. 

This was so long, and I still don't know what I'm trying to accomplish by writing it, but it's my first time really trying to jot these thoughts down and I would really appreciate you sharing any thoughts that come to your mind about this. I really don't know what to do or what I'm looking for here, but I felt the urge to post it.",11Mar2020,1

I started a new role about two months ago which on a superficial level is mostly good, definitely better than my old one - everyone's really nice and the team is great and on paper my role is what I want to do. 

But since starting this job my mental health during the working day (and a lot of the time out of it) has absolutely plummeted to almost zero, in terms of anxiety and general misery, which is no fun!! I just find myself constantly on absolute edge about everything that happens, dreading every day before I go in and every bit of each day yet to come once i'm in, and I can't stop worrying about everything. This is silly because my old job was much more actually stressful but for some reason this has gotten really bad here.

Sometimes if I just click really well with someone then the conversation is better and I learn to get over the awkwardness but it takes me some time to get there. 
Or why can’t I have that motivation and self-discipline to never miss a day of work and be really good at my job?

107,"I have been eating at myself, and I want to let some of this out. There will be talk of sexual abuse and self harm, if this is triggering to you, you should skip this post and I hope that things are doing better for you now.

To set this up, let me give you some context. I am the middle of three. My older brother took up a lot of my parent’s attention because he was always the source of chaos in the house, stealing and screaming matches were common. My younger sister, she took up the rest of their time, I feel. I was unremarkably normal, as a child. I didn’t cause many problems for my parents, I didn’t do anything necessarily interesting either. I guess that might be why I feel like I was kind of forgotten about at some points. 

Growing up, my cousin was always around us. She is 4 years older than me I believe. Now, this cousin has always been weird towards me. I remember that she would try to make me “play marriage” with her. I remember her saying that Edgar Allen Poe married his cousin or something like that. It’s a little fuzzy to me now, at least that part.

I only ever really saw her at my grandparents house. Here’s the thing about that house. It has a big yard, to the left side of the yard, there is a big thick bush that you can’t really see through, or over. I’m going to cut to the chase here, she was molesting me behind that bush. For seven years I believe. This was going on from before I understood what it meant to be sexually stimulated, going through the beginning years of puberty. It did not make me feel good, it felt twisted and upsetting. I’m not even attracted to girls, I’m gay. 
I could have easily made her stop, I was stronger than her towards the later years. I was just scared, I felt powerless. Sometime after  this ended, my grandma from the other side of my family died. I remember she was at the funeral, of course she singled me out, and started rubbing on my arm. Let me put this into perspective for you. 

It’s a warm summer day. I’m at my grandmother’s funeral. The performance is pitiful. I’m surrounded by family I don’t know, and direct family that doesn’t treat me like I’m there. On top of this, I stood out compared to everyone else, I’m a very flamboyant person, this was in catholic coal miner territory of Pennsylvania. I’m getting stares from people I don’t know. Death doesn’t do anything to me. I don’t feel anything when people die, it doesn’t make me sad, it doesn’t make me cry. I’ve been told to have empathy. Suddenly a hand starts stroking my arm, I look over and it’s that monster that tormented me for years. I knew she would be here. I had to come to the funeral. I wanted to stay home for this reason, I didn’t want to go, only to feel scared and small again.  I was standing there, getting more and more upset, and I was trying and failing to hold back tears, of course it looked like I was grieving. I wasn’t.


I’m naturally a very anxious person. That’s what led me to self harm as a coping mechanism to my anxiety. Her presence gave me so much anxiety that it essentially made me go into hours of self destruction. I wasn’t careful during those times, I could have easily died, I would slice my arms apart so I could feel something. Those were the nights when my wounds would take the longest to heal afterwards. 


Being molested twisted relationships and sex for me. I have problems being intimate with people that I feel for. I don’t like being touched in specific areas. This is really hard for me because a lot of the guys I’ve been with have been really hands on. There have been nights where I’ve cried into my pillow to hide how I was falling apart, but I didn’t stop them. 

Sex is hard for me because of a fetish that I believe developed due to the sexual abuse I dealt with. These days I can’t get off, unless I imagine that I’m dead. Like i have to imagine that the person I’m with murdered me. The idea of being murdered by a stronger guy during sex is what has wormed itself into my brain. I know it isn’t normal to find the idea of being murdered arousing. I like to imagine that he was choking me during sex, then he pushed too hard, and I’m just non existent anymore. The idea of slowly growing cold, and just being touched or loved after I’m gone. This is why I have guys choke me during sex, because of the chance that I will die, or suffocate. 


I’m a lot of work to be with, and that makes me upset because even though I have a couple hang ups, like a fetish that has essentially fully warped how I view sex, and being molested. It makes it hard to deal with me. It’s so upsetting because I want to have a boyfriend my own age, and just be able to be comfortable with him. I don’t want to feel like I’m fucking ripping myself apart from the inside anymore.


I’m not even twenty yet. I had to grow up fast and start taking care of myself, then what should be something that is supposed to be a bonding experience between lovers, got twisted by someone older than me, against my will. 

I recently came out to my parents and I feel like they don’t see me the same anymore. Things had been good since my brother moved out. They finally started paying attention to me, other than passing conversations. Now I’ll just see them looking at me from the corner of their eyes, it feels different now.


I’ve been suicidal since I can remember really, I don’t really see myself long on this planet. I know I need therapy, or medication, I just know I need help. I need it. I don’t want it, I want to die, I want to kill myself. 

I’ve tried to kill myself 3 times, and I’m still here somehow. I don’t want to upset my sister because I know she looks up to me. 


I know that I’m hard to deal with, I’m especially hard to be with because of my past. I can be a pain. My sexual life is fucked, my emotions are fucked. I still want to be with someone though. I want to love someone, i want to be loved. I miss being with someone that cared about me. I miss the tight feeling my chest would get around him, and how he would always make me laugh. It’s been so long since I’ve been embraced by someone I’ve really loved. I miss him. I miss being warm.

Maybe I can stick around for a little while longer. I know that with professional help I can get better. I can find a guy that I can rule my own life with. I just hope he’ll be patient with me.

I’m sorry that this is all over the place, I know that I will get upset again eventually and be depressed even more. I will still keep at this though, I think I’m going to start by getting some medication for my anxiety. Maybe that will help me curb stomp my self harm problems. I’ll look into therapy so I can get professional help with my trauma.

I used to self harm and attempt suicide a lot. Since I have gotten psychotherapy I have controlled a lot of these urges and I don't feel chronic suicidality. One thing he mentioned is that I have intense moods and it was a bit rapid cycling when I saw him. I have been deeply traumatised by some people with bpd and yet to identify with some of the traits of bpd, I feel very conflicted inside.

Then the open employment job told me to take a break cause it was renovating. But I am not a fast learner and I guess the boss put up with me. Then the vocational gig closed temporarily due to coronavirus. When I came back to the vocational job, I was kind of dazed, then they said temporarily closed due to coronavirus or something(again). I am not sure if I performed worse, but when I came back I felt like I had experienced cognitive decline. I had some grandiose things like wanting to have a big party and like getting pissed people weren't keen on the idea. Like wanting to wear a big wedding gown for my own photoshoot or becoming someone famous. But I never used suicide as a threat to keep a friend or boyfriend or parent from leaving me.

113,"I have noticed for a couple years now that I have an extremely hard time reading people’s mood. Not like Sheldon from Big Bang Theory where he just doesn’t understand social ques, but for some reason I always get the feeling like I upset people. For example I will make plans to hang out with my GF and when the time comes to hang out I always feel like she doesn’t want to be around me or that I am forcing her to hangout. I am worried every time that she will be upset that I am pulling her away from her day to be with me. I’ve asked her about it and she says that isn’t the case and that I’m making it all up. But the worse part is even with validation I still believe it. That I am just a nuisance to her. It’s not only my romantic relationships but with everything. Last example, my family and I went to my cousins wedding, and long story short I spent 2 hours crying and hating myself in the bathroom because I felt like no one wanted me there and that I was the reason for all the fighting the went on at the wedding. The groom and my brother both came into the bathroom to see if I was okay and I just lied and told them I was constipated, so even then I knew that I did nothing wrong, but my brain twists everything and it puts me in a constant state of worry and anxiety.

TLDR : I don’t know why my brain fabricates these situation but I feel like I have no control, that even when I know the truth my mind still makes me believe the bitter fallacy.

120,"Hi guys, this is my first post here. 

For the past couple months, I have had terrible insomnia caused by anxiety, paranoia, and delusions. When I did sleep, it was usually not for over 30-45 minutes at a time. I either had a night terror or sleep paralysis, which just made me want to stay up for the rest of the night out of fear that it would happen again. This is new; I usually sleep for 6-7 hours on school nights with sleep paralysis happening 2-3 times per month. 

I’ve been at my long-distance boyfriend’s house since Friday, and I’ve been sleeping excessively. For example, Monday night I slept from 4am (technically Tuesday morning) to 12am (technically this morning). 20 hours straight. Then I went back to sleep at 2am (this morning) and just woke up at noon. Last night wasn’t incredibly excessive (10 hours), but once it hits 4pm today, I will have slept for 30 hours out of 36. 

I’m concerned because I felt like going back to sleep as soon as I woke up today, and I very well could have. I’m just tired. Overwhelmingly so. 

Some background: I’m a 22 F in college on spring break. I have been diagnosed with MDD, GAD, BPD, and OCD, none of which seem to be relevant here. The paranoia and delusions are new, and I’ve spoken with my therapist about them.

My question is: is this amount of sleep alarming? What should I do to resist going back to sleep and how should I keep myself awake? Do you think the sudden change in sleeping habits has to do with the sudden change in environment? 

Thank you in advance. 🖤",11Mar2020,1

130,"Last year, I struggled with marijuana addiction. Living with my best friend who also enjoyed smoking caused us to get high together almost every day for months. I wasted my time, struggled financially, barely passed my classes.... a textbook stoner.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, I decided enough was enough and quit smoking weed. I began putting in very high effort in completing my third year of Biochemistry, taking 5 classes and simultaneously  working 30 hours a week at a boring student job, and DJing twice a week Fridays and Saturday nights. I didn't really need the money from both jobs, but I knew i was capable of working and studying and developed this workaholic habit.

&amp;#x200B;

With the help of Tinder, I ran into a girl who I've been in a relationship with for about 3 months now and things couldn't be better. Money's been good so I bought a car.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at the situation externally, things seem good. I'm doing well in school, making money, exercising daily and I'm very proud of my relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

AND YET, I wake up every morning with a demotivated &amp; depressed feeling, dreading the commencement of my tedious day. Over time, this feeling grew, as I became more exhausted and refused to deal with it. I don't want to be at work, I don't want to study, I don't even find DJing fun anymore, I struggle to make conversation with my girlfriend, I've become less sociable and more self conscious. A less confident form of my past self.

I tried quitting coffee and alcohol and did that for about a month and honestly it just made things worse, I think I need caffeine to survive the lifestyle I've developed for myself and alcohol helps unwind at the end of the week.

To understand how deep the problem is I have to go back to when I was 3 years old. 

When I was 3 years old my parents car rolled into the river with the result of dragging my brother to death. 

I was inside the car but was rescued by my mother who ran out after the car and pulled me out.

My dad's decision to deal with it was to lie and act like it didn't happen. So I was told the breaks snapped rolling forward over my brother and father. Also that somehow my dad miraculously not injured while my brother was crushed on a flat treeless beach. Did I mention they even lied about my brother's age and where he was buried.

For years I didn't remember what happened then I had a dream about climbing between the front seats of a car, grabbing the gear stick to pull myself forward and the gear slipping. The car rolled into the river and started filling. I even remembered being pulled out by my mom.

(Note: I don't think confronting my parents will help. And from what I've seen the lie is mainly my dad's.)

Later when I went to school I was socially isolated because I was shy, poor and smelled bad. So it didn't help I drew unwanted attention from a bully named Bill. Bill was set upon me by Jenny the self proclaimed queen of the playground who dictated the rules or she would sick Bill on student.

I don't know if it's true but my parents claimed Bill was the son of a teacher or volunteer was the reason no one did anything.

All I know is that Bill began began beating me up and the duty in charge would just tell me, ""He's just playing.""

At first I was one of many Bill was beating up but as time went by fewer and fewer were being beaten until I was the only one being beaten. The beatings lasted longer and became more vicious.

I told my parents and the teachers. My parents complained to the teachers. The school refused to do anything. My dad in response gave me permission to defend myself. He didn't bother to teach me self-defense he just assumed I would be able to on my own. So I continued to be beat-up.

Then one day I accidentally hurt him while trying to free myself. The school wanted to expel me as violent student. This didn't happen because my dad threatened to bring in the police to deal with Bill. 

(Note: This is why I believe students should have the right to self-defense and the school should have no say in this.)

There is more but I have things to do.

Literally nothing ever goes a positive way for me. I have no hobby’s because nothing interests me or I get upset about my lack of skill in anything. I’m mediocre in every aspect of my life and I have one person who means anything to me. My life has been ruined by prejudices and ignorance and I’ve never recovered. I also have the worst luck out of anyone I’ve ever met.

145,"Okay, so a few months ago I had this strange experience and I think I might have been dissociating. I have never been professionally diagnosed but I know that I have depression and anxiety, but I also have symptoms for other disorders so I’m a bit confused. Anyway, I had a weird experience a few months ago that I think is a symptoms of DID (dissociative identity disorder) Here is the diary entry I wrote that day explaining my experience:

My father just walked down the hallway, and I can’t tell if I was asleep or not. I wasn’t on my phone and it just felt like I blacked out or something. It’s weird.
And I remember it being around 3pm when I “blacked out,” and now it’s 3:13pm. My head feels so weird. This is so weird. I didn’t have that sensation of waking up. It just felt like when my dad started walking down the hallway I went back to reality. It was as if I wasn’t aware of my surroundings or if I was just staring into the unknown without really knowing. What if I did something without knowing? What is this? I feel so weird.

Last thing I remember is being on my phone listening to music TRYING to fall asleep. My Dad came upstairs and disturbed my pretended sleep and then went back downstairs. I just don’t know if I resumed sleeping or decided to play on my phone. But when I “woke up” I was propped up on a pillow on my back, no earbuds in or anything. And mind you, I never sleep on my back, I sleep on my side. Plus, whenever I’m napping I listen to music to help me fall asleep. But I don’t remember ever adjusting to that position, or getting off my phone. And I feel like if I was trying to fall asleep without my music, then I would’ve plugged my phone in. But my phone wasn’t plugged in.",11Mar2020,1

148,"I am an adult female and I find myself often obsessing over men who are cold and distant and somewhat seem dark and judgemental of others. I dislike their personality, their cynicism and distance they have from other people. I even feel a lot of anger towards them even if they have done nothing to me. However I find myself craving attention from them and somehow in my mind I feel like if they give me attention and approval it will make me feel wonderful about myself and loved. I feel like when I get love and attention from men who are normal and non-cynical people, I can't feel the same joy and happiness, as when a cold person gives it to me. I also quickly develop sexual feelings for these types of men, which are kind of strange, they are not normal psysical sexual feelings (which I have for other men), but I can also feel them in my gut and feel some type of fear at the same time which is very exiting and feels good and bad at the same time. These types of men are usually very unpleasant to be in relationship with, as they don't give you much emotional security, which is what I crave a lot in a relationship. I experience mostly pain with these types but still obsess over them for some reason. I am mostly obsessed with their personality and feel anger and wish to change them but also a deep need for approval. Am I just an insecure woman? Is this related to some kind of trauma?
I did have some neglect and abuse, growing up, verbal and psysical however I still belive I was raised in a loving family and my parents were not perfect but they still loved me.

149,"Sorry that this isn't really in the right sub, I didn't know exactly where to ask, and people on this sub seem helpful and friendly. I have a couple of questions about meds and traveling within the US.

 - I'm flying across the country next week for spring break (yes, bad timing with the virus, I know) and I was wondering if anyone had any tips/tricks in terms of carrying their meds with them? I will take them in my personal bag and keep them in their original containers just incase I have any issues. I have taken meds before without issue but this time I will have to take 12 pill bottles with me so can't really have them loose in my bag. They don't quite fit in a lunchbox size container either. Does anyone have this problem / a solution? I get freaked out by flying enough as it is and worrying about my pills is just unnecessary stress.

 - If I end up getting sick (not just covid, but a cold or something) then it would be bad for me to get on a plane to go back to school (we're online now anyway). But I am due to run out of my stimulants a few days after I'm scheduled to come back (I can't fill it before I leave because it's controlled). Is it easy to transfer scripts to different pharmacies across states? Is it more difficult if the drug is controlled?

151,"High anxiety levels and panic due to Covid-19. Anyone else in the same boat as me?

I’m an international student at Rutgers who’s currently living with some relatives of mine in New Jersey itself. They’re all living their everyday lives like normal. They’re going to work, they’re taking the dog out for walks, they’re eating from restaurants etc.

I on the other hand am unbelievably stressed, panicked and anxious with the way the situation is unfolding in front of us. I have cousins and siblings who work in NY/NJ, I’m constantly thinking about how they’re still working and going to office and interacting with a bunch of people on an everyday basis, even as the virus grows. 

The problem is that I can’t see any end to this situation and there’s no guarantee who gets it and who doesn’t. Even if you get it, there’s no guarantee that we make it through. At a point, I’m not even all that concerned for myself as I am for my grand parents. 

My entire day goes by literally just thinking about this and reading up on the virus. And as the virus spreads and as we get over 1000+ cases; there’s no stopping domestic or international travel for anyone. We’re in a situation where the virus is constantly on the move.

I know that I personally have a very low chance of coming into contact with someone who’s infected.

But I can’t help but fear for everything; all the time.

I don’t know who to talk to at this point tbh. I’ve gone to caps, but it’s not been a whole lotta help. 

Is there anyone out here who also feels the same way?",11Mar2020,2

I know that sentence sounded really toxic but its little things like him trying to make small talk me saying I can’t talk and then him saying he wants to kill himself and so I’m out in the position to help him or be terrible so of course I help him. But every time I try to help him he acts like a fucking movie character. He talks about himself like he’s the joker or something and it makes me so upset because I’m genuinely trying to help him and he says shit like “I’d rather live out the song paranoid by black sabith” after I tell him to see a therapist he also said “id rather push down my emotions and have a tough to break personality” I feel trapped because I feel like I can’t carry the weight of his constant suicide threats but I can’t do anything. Also when he’s not talking about suicide it’s murder, which can be even more scary to me because he seems honest. What I’m asking is how do I break it to him that his refusal to get help is hurting me? I know I’m the only one he talks to about this stuff. And I feel like he thinks it’s funny when I beg him to see a therapist.",11Mar2020,1
153,"I'm pretty certain my brother is suffering from depression and anxiety. He hasn't ever gone to find help, and doesn't seem to be interested in doing so. I would bring up the idea of finding help, but I have learned that it usually doesn't go well if I bring up uncomfortable subjects. He tends to get very irate and then sometimes starts crying. I have learned that unless he brings it up, it's best not to approach the subject. 

We have a new situation that is forcing him out of his comfort zone, and it's not going well. It has to do with a new roommate and some basic cleanliness issues, specifically dirty dishes. I propose that we all agree to not leave dirty dishes in the kitchen or to leave dishes in the drying rack (we can stash stuff in our rooms for a day or so if we don't feel like immediately doing them). Everyone agrees to this.

Now a side note, I have had issues like this in the past with my brother. He'll usually be good for a week or two, before going back to leaving the dishes lying around or w/e the current issue is. Then if I approach the subject, he becomes irate and sometimes starts crying. I came to the conclusion that it was just easier for me if I just did all the cleaning. I can't really push that onto the new roommate, so now I'm pretty much forced to stop enabling my brother.

Well it happened pretty much like I thought it might. A couple weeks go by and it's all good, then dishes start piling up and the kitchen is all dirty again the next week. I talk with him as nicely as I can, but he get's irate and starts crying. I tell him it's not fair to treat me that way when I need to talk about these things and I try so hard to be nice. Well he stomped off and cleaned his stuff up and now is pretty much only coming home to sleep and is barricading himself in his room when he is here. 

I'm giving him his space, and letting him decide when he wants to start talking. (pretty sure it won't go well if I try to start talking with him) I really want him to go get help, maybe get on some medication or therapy or something, anything. I'm just not sure how anything can get better for him if he doesn't try to get help, I know I certainly can't do it for him. 

He has a tendency to want me to be wrong or to want to do the opposite of whatever I suggest, so I'm unsure if it would even help for me to give him phone #s or websites or w/e - I feel like he'd just see it as condescending. Not sure of what to do or how to help, just giving him his space until he decides to talk with me again. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",11Mar2020,1

157,"Hi, I'm 20yo men and my life is really though at the moment for me. To understand why I'm in this situation I have to start from the beginning. I came to London at October 14 of 2018. I found a job and I found my best friend Anton. I was so happy about my life, everything in my head seemed so good, I had very good attitude in my life, then at 2019 summer my friend had to go back at Spain, because of his girlfriend. I understood (even if it was sad). But I still had that healthy thinking.  Then I started working at new department at my workplace and I meet this woman. She clearly showed me that she likes me and I started feeling same and because we were working together our connection only got stronger (Oh I forgot to mention one important thing about her, she's 33yo, but I didn't care about that, I even told her that this is not a problem for me) but, then I saw first flag, it's how aggressive she was, when she was in a bad mood ( at that time I thought it's just a bad day for her) then there started appearing more flags like, she was started getting angry because of basic communication misunderstandings, I really tried  to explain everything to her, one time I even said sorry, because I thought she was hurting, then she just say I only give 2 chances and you used your first one. And when second time, she got angry on me ( actually I don't even know why I just asked her if everything is alright after she got angry on colleague for making mistake at work). She said it was your last chance. And all that time I was with her she was always making me feel guilty about who I'm, everytime I showed some kind of emotion or feeling she just backed (even tho she was showing it constantly to me) she was so toxic, she was poisoning my mind. I even cried after all this situation(I haven't done that since like 12, because people I grow around was saying 'man up', 'you're are not kid anymore' and more similar stuff like this). I was feeling so terrible after all this I still feeling terrible and I feel like I'm going downhill. I don't have my charisma anymore I don't want to talk, laugh, everyday it's hard to wake up and start a day, I missed so many days at work just to be alone, get high so my mind could be quiet. I just want to be a person I was, I miss my laugh, I miss myself...

159,"Growing up I was very emotionally abused and bullied by my dad. My mom was very subordinate. 

Fast forward at age 27, I finally was at a place where I was emotionally healed from my dad's abuse with the help of an incredible therapist, and for about 2 years was on a journey towards loving myself and others while feeling protected and safe in what seemed like a solid community.

My therapist died of cancer after those two years, and that year it all crumbled when a friend of a friend from Boston entered the community that we had created, and the negativity, witty and aggressive insults, and gossiping about friends completely shifted the dynamic of the group into one of being toxic and judgmental. The ""friend"" moved a few blocks up from me, and what seemed like her social blackmail of getting close, gaining intimate details about you, and then gossiping about others (which meant if you betrayed her, she surely would tell everyone her thoughts about you and what you shared, if she hadn't already). So I foolishly did not dare stray, and tried to be strong in her presence. To make matters worse, she was extremely intelligent and influential as a result.

All it did was make me feel weaker and weaker and more and more scared and tiny. It was horrendous. It seemed that everyone started to see me in this light, and all my freedom left me. I get paranoid in large groups now. I become weak among those who are confident. Everything has reversed.

Ever since this, I haven't been able to recover in the same way I did with my therapist. He was someone who had a love that was strong beyond human capacity it seemed. It felt like an army of love.

How do I become strong again and feel like I have a force of love behind me that so many from healthy, big families feel? I have very few friends now and am left with a very dysfunctional family and verbally/emotionally abusive dad.",11Mar2020,1

165,"I thought I was done with this. I mean, everyone suffers from it but not 3 times in a week. It hasn't happened for three months. But it happened again last night. 


After some point I started to get used to it. I'd wake up middle of the night, all my body is paralysed. And the panic, a silent scream, would rise but nothing helps. As I get panic more, things would get worse and worse. I'd feel the strength of the evil all over my body. The hands would get tighter tighter and tighter until my body finally gets released. Yeah, it's as bad as it sounds, if not worse.


Then I literally stepped up a level in this shit. It started to happen 5-6 times in a row. It was like, I'd wake up with a paralysed body, all that panic and horror stuff, then I'd get released, fall into deep sleep immediately, wake up again in seconds paralysed, panic and horror, get released, fall into deep sleep...


 I read about it. It says ""to prevent the sleep paralysis again, don't fall asleep immediately once you experienced one."" It makes sense but the thing is I cannot prevent falling asleep when it happens. It's like I'm trying to open my eyes and wake myself up so I can drink a glass of water or take some deep breaths or scroll my phone a bit or at least change my sleeping position but no I'm unable to do these, I just uncontrollably close my eyes only to open them again in horror in 10 seconds.


Now I can deal with an ordinary sleep paralysis after all these experiences but these 5-6 times attacks just too much for me to handle. It guarantees a confused, distracted, gloomy next day. And I'm just...don't know what to do since it's started all over again.


Last night I woke up middle of the night, in a normal way, and moved around a bit trying to fall asleep again. My movements woke my boyfriend up too and  he stroke my hair to make me fall asleep. I immediately fall asleep but woke up again soon. I was more like half sleeping half awake. My boyfriend was laying down next to me awake and reading book. I closed my eyes again between those half asleep half awake circle. And it happened. I opened my eyes with a paralysed body. I know my eyes were closed but I was seeing my boyfriend next to me, reading his book. I wanted to let him know. I wanted to move a little bit of my finger so he'd see me. Just a whisper. But I was motionless and silent like a dead. And second time and third time...

With the Coronavirus being a top priority at the moment, there were quesrions that had to be asked. I'm way too honest and said that I had been coughing due to my hayfever and was ONLY coughing for one day. 

They freaked out and forced me to wear a mask. I can't have anything covering my face due to a past trauma but they didn't care. 

I slightly put it on but I was shaking so bad I couldn't tie it properly. 

My doctor came out to get me and noticed it wasn't tied properly. She refused to let me know of anything I went there for until the mask was on. Again, I was shaking and having flashbacks and I told her I cannot have this covering me. Not only was she late, spoke about the ""problem patient"" in front of me and refused to let me know results. 

Then when she finally did tell me my results when I had the mask on (I has hyperventilating, shaking, crying) she mentioned something about canerous cells but didnt explain anything to me. 

I went there for 3 reasons: birth control, mental health and results. 
I only got results.

I don’t know what to do, he is seeing a professional, he has a support system but nothing is helping. I can’t lose him, not after everything it took for both of us to find each other and happiness. What can I do? Can someone give me advice, can someone please help me?",11Mar2020,1
181,"Hello, My name is Magnus i recently turned 19 this year and i am a high functioning autistic male and lately i've been thinking there might be something very wrong with me.

  I am an artist, i enjoy making my own characters and stories and i am not sure if it's my autism or not that makes me think like this, but i often overstep a boundary and don't know what is real life or not. I haven't talked to another human being in so long that anytime i try and talk to someone even online i feel like i have to run away or distract them someone so i can disappear. I have a partner right now too , they're very nice and it's going alright but they live all the way across the world and the time difference is like 6 hours ahead. anyways,, yeah reality is hard for me and i don't know if i'm a stable human being or not anymore. would love some advice please.",11Mar2020,1
182,"is there something wrong with me? i’ve noticed that a lot of times throughout the day i almost “daydream” about what would happen if i died. i often times think about how my boyfriend would react when he hears the news or my mom, my teachers, my friends, etc. i never really think about how i died, but more so just how the people close to me would react to my death. it sounds super morbid and i don’t know exactly why i do this, but i am certain that i would never want to harm myself or anything of that matter. is this a sign of a mental health illness or should i be worried?",11Mar2020,1

184,"I’m 18 male and I’ve been struggling with depression for a long time. Recently I decided to try and get help for the first time but all chances at CBT or other more appealing therapies were put to rest as I don’t have loads of money and there’s no free help available. 

But I can get antidepressants through the NHS but this is a last resort but I’ve recently dipped again and I can’t take it anymore and I’m considering them. 

Can anyone offer any alternatives or insight into this?
Sorry if this is the wrong place but and thanks in advance",11Mar2020,1
185,"Today when at music lessons I started to freak out because I couldn’t see. I could see everything but at the same time I couldn’t see at all. It’s like everything was blurry and nothing held the right color and it made me want to cry. I kept trying to look at the notes because when I got closer they went black but this only freaked me out more because it meant I legit couldn’t see... On top of this the sound of violin was too like much and I couldn’t process idmedjwjs if that makes sense and so I started to twitch. 

Because of this I started twitching and I have ADHD so I was already spacing out a lot and I have fucking social anxiety so then I start sweating so much because he looked at me funny because I wasn’t paying attention and was spazzijf out and then I dropped the bow because of the sweat and had to turn around and stare at a wall until I was able to regain composure.",11Mar2020,2
