1,"So my mom abused me for 11 years, whatever. It's been obvious to me I have mommy issues. But recently I've realized I have Daddy issues. I realized when I ask my dad a question, how he dances around the question with jokes and essentially comes to ""whatever stop asking"". And I realized how he's always done this. I used to idolize him as the Disneyland Parent, the greatest and most caring dad in the world. But I realized that whenever I ask him a question he never gives me a straight answer, and never considers my opinion in anything related to me. He does not respect me as a person. I thought this was something recently, because he's aging or something, but I thought about it and realized he's always treated me like I wasn't worthy of an answer, because I wouldn't understand it or he just didn't want to spend that energy on me, and how it ultimately taught me not to question my mom's abuse. 
Now my dad's girlfriend is around. She talks to me and tells me when things are coming up. But still it's usually with little details, and when we agree on something (like her not spending the nights on Thursday night because that's my therapy night), she just casually breaks our agreements and then laughs it off. Neither of them think what I'm comfortable with is important and they barely ask me. 
I tried confronting my dad's absent parenting today, but he started getting angry and yelled about how he does so much. Why should he even feed me? 
I dont expect anything much helpful in the comments, I just really needed to rant. It must be teen angst. I just cant stand that I jumped from living in one toxic household to the next. This was supposed to be my saving grace.

2,"Not sure where to begin but I feel my mental health slipping away. I think it started around 7 years ago but the last 2-3 years its gotten much much worse and I dont know what to do or where to go for help. I constantly catch myself getting mad or upset over small things but now moreso than before I just go into this uncontrollable fit of rage, I try and distance myself from those around me during those moments I wouldn’t hurt them physically but verbally and emotionally. I’m even in my head screaming at myself to calm down and relax to take it easy and take some deep breaths but I dont even seem to listen to myself which is why I’m lost. I dont know what I’d need to do to help myself because if i cant even listen to myself to calm down why would I listen to someone else? Theres so much more to my story as is the case with everyone but this is the biggest problem at the moment i really wish I could change about myself.",16Feb2020,1
3,"Hi I am 29(m).

After a series of traumatic events that occurred late 2017 throughout 2019 spanning health issues (GI issues caused by a mold infestation from Hurricane Harvey), being cheated on and dumped(5 yr relationship with a fiance), and abuse from a narcissistic mother (moved in with her for 7 months after my health and mental crashed from the break up), I am now riddled with 24/7 thoughts of pure negativity and self-loathing. My friends have pretty much alienated me because they are tired of my shit and when they do talk to me I find ways to sneak my complaints in, pushing them further away. I'm getting therapy and treatment and that has given me some improvement and I am just starting family counseling with my mother, but none of it seems to be taking the edge off my constant negative thoughts. I am scheduled to see a psychiatrist in March, I'm hoping that will do something for my quickly deteriorating mind. I wasn't like this prior to my last relationship as my ex also had strong bouts of depression, although admittingly I was not capable or ready to handle it, and often I made it worse. I guess this is just karma for me, but I don't think she battled with this constant barrage of negative thoughts. I want to die but I realize I'm too afraid to pull the trigger myself. I am often reading self-help books and trying to regain my health as much as possible, it has improved a bit, but I am still deathly afraid I might revert back to how I was. NO matter what I do it's just a constant flow of self hate in my mind, and I am grateful I can actually sleep now (had insomnia for 3 straight months right after the initial break up), sleeping is really the only enjoyable thing in my life. I can understand why young men have some of the highest suicide rates, and I keep holding strong at the idea that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, that's why I haven't done anything drastic yet. I am planning to move to San Diego this year as quickly as I can, not banking on that the move will fix anything, but I really enjoy SoCal and the city and hoping a place of my choosing will give me a bit more hope to grip onto.

5,"I've been passed between so many NHS services over the past 10 years, with at most 8 sessions at a place before being passed elsewhere.
The general consensus is that I'm too hard to diagnose but it's starting to make me feel insane.
So I'm starting to question my sanity, and if I'm making everything up.

I suffered a fair amount of abuse growing up, and a lot of emotional abuse from my parents ever since. As a result I'm very unable to properly connect to the experiences I have and the people I'm around.

My question is, am I broken and making it up, or am I ill? I don't know what to do anymore. I went to A&amp;E last week because I thought I was going to kill myself and they discharged me because I'm on a waiting list so they can't help.

Am I making this up or am I hard to diagnose? I think I need reassurance...

11,"*My cousin has been one of my best friends for almost 20 years. He was the best man at my wedding.*

He's also one of the most calm, cool, and collected people I've ever met. His poise and awareness have always been admirable in my eyes. Most importantly he's never shown one sign of mental illness in the 20 years that we've grown up together.

Last week he was due to receive a promotion to CEO of his company, and during that meeting it started. Him and his girlfriend had to leave early. 

**He said they were going to the Amazon. He said the car didn't need gas. He said he didn't need money anymore, that we should all share. He threw his wallet out of the window.** 

His girlfriend, and sister eventually got him to our nearest mental health facility.

**He was taking pictures down off of the walls, he was dancing on tables. He was going into other patients rooms to steal their blankets, and to dump their trash bins on top of them. He stole an employees phone to call home. **

They're calling it a manic break. His workload has always been wild. He has never shied away from it, and cares deeply about his profession. He's someone who wants to be an impactful part of the community, and wants to make the world a better place. It appears he put too much on his plate. 

Those things he's done during this episode are not characteristic of the man that I know, so something is wrong. It appears to me that stress has eaten away at him, and maybe...just maybe triggered something permanent. I hope not, but I accept it as a possible outcome. 

I get to see him tomorrow. An hour visitation. I will go expecting nothing in particular. I'll be there to show him that I love him, and that I'll always be there to support him. Always, and forever. I'm very anxious to see him. His mother told me that he's more in touch with reality now. This eases the tension only slight of course, but I was happy to hear it. 

I don't know why I posted this to be completely honest. I've talked about it with my wife, and I've cried to her, because I'm scared. I also cried because I know he's alone right now, and could be scared himself. 

I thought some of you may have some experiences with behaviors or scenarios like this. Mostly it was just nice to type it out, but if you're reading I'd just like to leave you with this...

It's okay to not be okay.

It is OKAY to NOT be OKAY.

If you have a support system use it.

If you can't handle your work load dump it.

It is okay to not be okay.

If anyone has stories of their own, or may be able to add some context from their experiences I'd love to hear from you. Thank you for taking the time.

12,"I’ve made a similar post before but here it goes:
Since I was younger I’ve always convinced myself of things to be upset about, almost like I needed to dream something up to be anxious about like having bedbugs, lice, that my mom was going to kill herself while I slept, etc. 
The last few months I’ve noticed I’ve been very hot and cold with my boyfriend and getting upset at him for hating me or thinking I’m fat and things like that even though he doesn’t say any of that and replies with things like “no I love you!”  But I’ll just cry in bed and distance myself from him and say he hates me and is lying (I know this is abusive, I’m looking for therapy). Within the last few weeks I’ve also had similar situations where I’ve “decided” things like my mom is ignoring me as a punishment for upsetting my sister over Christmas break and that my sister got a dog to try and drive me out of the family (I have a fear of dogs) rather than simply because she wanted a companion. Both of these instances made me upset enough to lead to suicidal ideation, deciding I hate my mom, and blocking my sister because “I no longer wanted to have a relationship with someone who is trying to eliminate me from the family”. These thoughts come on suddenly rather than like when I was little and decided I must have bed bugs with no signs after watching a documentary on them. 
I assume these are the result of anxiety but I think I only really* experience social phobia. I’m slightly worried about it as I don’t want me being stressed for no reason to harm my relationships and keep making me upset. 

Am I just low self worth/anxious or could this be something bigger? I was worried about potential BPD or something and my old psychiatrist was still assessing me for bipolar 2 when I stopped going but I’m confident I don’t have either. I think I’m fine and “normal” until I get anxious/have thoughts like these- then I’m crying and want to SH etc",16Feb2020,1

23,"TL;DR Any ideas of self traditions to manage anniversaries of traumas/ days that suck because of trauma? 

Today I was lying in bed and started thinking about my birthday. I'm turning 21 in March and it occured to me that I probably won't get any cards or whatever. I know this is a stupid thing to care about and I have better things to be upset about, but it's making me really sad. 

I left my parents a few years ago because they were emotionally and physically abusive (specifically when I showed signs of OCD) and I am incredibly proud of that choice. But it's hard having no one (I haven't spoken to any of my relatives since I fled). I have about six photos of my childhood because I wasn't able to take much when I left and around this time of year it really seems to get to me. Maybe it's that mother's day is coming up, or thinking about how if I had a different life I would get cards in the mail from relatives- regardless I feel like I am missing out. It almost feels like I'm less of a person because I don't have familial love. That sounds hella dramatic, but it's kind of true. 

I have an extremely small social circle because I often am bedridden because of my health and lately it kind of feels like the people I am friends with don't care about things the same way I do. I visit friends who live about an hour away once a month, despite it causing problems for my health and they never take the time visit me (even when I am extremely sick). I know they won't visit me for my birthday and likely won't do more than post on Facebook. My friends near by will likely spend time with me, but not in a birthday sense. It will just be a ""this Friday we will have a movie night instead of going out without her"" which doesn't really make me feel loved or celebrated, but instead kind of just reminds me that I'm not well enough to be a 20 year old and go out to the clubs and bars. 

Anyway, I'm trying to figure out how I can celebrate myself instead. For example, on the anniversary of leaving abuse I always get a ring. It's a physical way of seeing how far I've come and it makes me feel a little bit less sad. I want to do something similar for my birthday and mother's day- essentially create traditions that turn kind of shitty holidays for me into something that I can semi look forward to.

I’m uncomfortable and I still wasn’t then. She cares, she’s just trying to tell me how to shower. She saw scars on my legs and said things like “Why are you doing this to yourself?”. I just remember staring down at my legs and feeling terrible. I stayed quiet. Why does this memory suck so much?? Sometimes I’m even scared to go into that bathroom because I’m scared she’ll decide to check up.

I’m a bit off topic now, so back to what I was thinking in the beginning. I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. Nothing ever changes in my life, it’s like everything is just repeating. The only thing that is sometimes changing, is the setting (where I live/exist), and the stuff that’s happening around me. 

I don’t know if I’m happy or sad. I get to school, laugh with my only friend, have my classes, then just go home again. When I laugh with my friend I think I am happy, but I don’t know.

Sometimes friends would say stuff like they would care, but I always felt like that is somewhat contradictory because realistically they wouldn't notice in the first place, so how could they care?  I feel like I'm always the one who's trying to strike up conversations or plan events with people just to maintain any semblance of contact with them.  So I feel like if I'm gone, they wouldn't even notice and would just carry on with their lives.

34,"So I've mentioned this before on other subreddits: r/Guilt, r/depression maybe... eh.

This is going to sound MEGA pathetic... but...

Well, anyway... I'm mentioning it here because I'm sick of the pain and I really need help. Yes, I am seeking therapy, but it won't happen for a while. I'm also trying to be as open-minded as I can to the idea of therapy, but it's very depressing being told there are so limited options (that I know of) to help cease this pain. Drugs, talking, crying, sleep.

None of those have ever really helped tremendously... Although they have succeeded in calming me for certain amounts of time.

The story is, I'm a transgender male (FTM) and I only came out to my family (most of them anyway,) a year ago. I'm currently still in High School. My mother accepts me wholeheartedly and does whatever she can to support me. She brags about me to her family and does her best to show me off whenever she can. She also has Reddit... so I hope she doesn't find this. (Fuck.)

My father, not so much. He told me-- when I first came out-- that it went against his Christian beliefs, and that there'd be ""certain rules about this,"" as long as I were ""under his roof,"" which meant that he was not going to allow me to transition, or at least he'd put up a big ass fight... and obviously I'm not old enough to leave, nor do I want to. My mom, brother, and dog are here, and I'd hate to leave them. Plus, I don't know the first thing about the adult world, mostly because of my (pretty crippling) anxiety (diagnosed.)

It didn't register for a while, but when it did, it hit me like a fucking truck. I was remembering all the times we shared together:

* Waking up for Kindergarten and eating Honey Buns while watching Max &amp; Ruby,
* Him making me full bubble baths, and me making bubble-pies to ""serve"" him,
* Him saying my prayers and tucking me in at night,
* Him reading a book to me about a girl and her daddy: ""Would you still love me if I were a dinosaur? Or a nasty fly? Or a crazy horse??"" and the daddy saying: ""Yes, of course, I'll always love you - No matter what.""
* Us going out on the porch of our old apartment, and grilling. I'd never grill because I was too young, but I'd keep him company and watch geese. He called me his ""grilling buddy.""

It felt like a major punch to the gut, as if all of that was completely fake. As if all of it meant absolutely nothing... because he never valued me as a person. The only thing he saw in his ""daughter"" was the sexual organs and gender stereotypes I was given... and It felt like pulling off a BIG ASS bandaid. Maybe even removing a cast...

But eventually, that pain was pushed into the filing cabinet of shit in my brain, and thrown into the dark closet I was once in, never to be opened for very long again. Then, my parents began to argue more. They'd argue when my brother and I weren't home, and they'd sometimes argue when we were. If they did, he'd usually try to drag us into it.

My mom edited my school info, telling them of my preferred name and pronouns and such, and he tried numerous times to edit that, and erase whatever my mom had put. He's not a bad person, and I'll always love my dad, but that shit really fucking hurts... I've been doing my best not to ask him for much anymore. If he wants to give me something, I'll accept, but I usually don't ask for anything myself, because I feel as if he's trying to buy me back like he always does after something happens. 

We went to the transgender clinic, and at one point I got very excited, as the doctors were talking about Testosterone. I was ecstatic until I looked over and noticed my parents. My dad looked so dead inside... my mom was crying. I basically asked her ""what's wrong"" with my eyes, because words wouldn't come out. She said, ""It's a mourning period."" 

That was the straw that broke the camel's back... and broke my fucking heart. She still doesn't understand why it hurt me so much, and I can't tell her because of-- VOILA-- anxiety. I remember feeling the worst anger, the deepest depression, and the most crawling guilt I'd ever felt, and all at once.

That hurt more than what my dad had said did. Because I felt she was completely on my side, and didn't care about what voice, name, or reproductive pieces I had. I felt she understood my struggle, as much as a Cis person and a mother could. Hearing those words fucked me up in the head. It made me realize that everything bad that'd been happening was my fault.

Them fighting, my fault.

Them crying, my fault.

Their dreams for their little girl growing into a woman being crushed into dust, my fault. 

Parents have everything 100% planned out for you from the day you're born. And because of me, those plans were ruined. I felt so fucking guilty and sad, I didn't know what to do with myself. I wanted to disappear forever. I wanted to ask the God I didn't believe in ""WHY"" this was happening to me? I knew that sounded pathetic. There are/were people living in much worse situations. I felt/feel I had no right to complain about something so insignificant. 

I mean what the hell's wrong with me? This lump of muscle and knowledge in this thick ass skull... what does it do? It twists into a fucking Rubix cube puzzle, and ends up making younger me feel like he's ""technically killed someone.""

I'd already felt like that, but hearing those words made it all... real, kind of. In a way. 

I felt like a LITERAL murderer because I wanted to be myself. ""What if I'm not me, and old me is dead?"" ""What if I killed me?"" and then ""That's ridiculous, retard! YOU are you, and you can't kill yourself and then still be alive!"" It flipped on and off from ""That's absurd and pathetic that you'd think that!"" and ""But It's true. I've ruined their view of me and killed the person I was... I'm an awful person."" Blah, blah, blah...

This shit comes back STILL, almost weekly/monthly.

I wish I wasn't so fucking sorry... I wish I could tell her how she made me feel because I know she didn't mean it the way my stupid ass brain took it. Did she? 

Sometimes I just wish I could vanish and everyone's lives I've been in would be better without me... (although I'm not suicidal, as I have an irrational fear of death.)

Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I feel guilty over shit I cannot control because my stupid adolescent brain took words and twisted them wrong. I need help, but help is a long ways away.

35,"Hello I'm not really sure if this is ok but I don't know what to do. Also sorry I'm on mobile. Also also, I've been posting this in a few other subs and so far no responses. 

2 years ago I suddenly just felt like I was having a heart attack while at work and went home early. I had shortness of breath, tightness in my chest, and just felt like I was going to die. I put off going to the doctor as long as I could since I didn't have health care. The feeling would come and go throughout the day, getting worse around bedtime. After about 5 days I went to an emergency room and found out it wasn't a heart attack and I was told I had Gerd. They said my esophagus was inflamed and that may explain some symptoms. I eat a lot of fast food so it made sense to me. The symptoms had almost completely disappeared at that point so I took the medicine for Gerd that they gave me and I was fine for about a year.

After a year I had another week long episode and at this point I figured it was just panic attacks or anxiety brought on from my shitty diet. I didn't go to the doctor that time and things just sorted themselves out. I was fine for another 9 months or so.

A couple months ago, at the end of December, I got the flu and felt horrible for a few days. One of those days I suddenly started feeling the same symptoms that I had felt before. I remember very clearly how quickly it came over me while I was sitting down in my living room. By this time I could recognize what was happening and just kept telling myself that I was going to eventually be ok but this time I now had a second job and was working 6 days a week. This new job isn't as flexible with calling out sick so when the time came I tried to just power through the work day. I did half a shift and left early. What I now believe to be anxiety was just too much to handle being at work. 

I tried again the next day but again had to call my boss to leave early and had a full blown attack while trying to talk to him over the phone. To his credit he was very understanding and talked with me until another supervisor could come to me and help make sure I was OK. I just sat there and tried to breathe for 20 minutes. My face was numb/tingly, and my heart was beating hard. I eventually collected myself and was even able to drive myself home.

I went to the emergency room again with my dad, still focusing on breathing, and eventually saw a doctor. The doctor told me that my lungs weren't able to expand all the way and take full breathes due to inflammation in my body probably brought on from the flu. I expressed my concern that this may not be the entire problem and that I was afraid that I had some kind of anxiety issue. She gave me medicine to deal with the inflammation, an inhaler for my lungs, and some Ativan just in case. I took everything except the Ativan and was feeling fine after a couple days.

That brings us to now. I started feeling these symptoms again, just a little over a month after the last episode. I could sort of feel it coming on last Wednesday and decided to take an Ativan. It calmed me down and I slept like a baby that night. Monday it came in full swing. I've had to focus on my breathing non stop this whole week.

 I've broken down in tears twice worrying that I'm worrying my family. Worried that I may have to quit my jobs. Worrying that this is how my life will be from now on. Worrying that if I rely on Ativan to get me through this then I'll never really recover. I've already dropped my calculus class that I was taking at my local college. Last month I started the process of getting healthcare and my case worker says to expect a letter in the mail in the next week or two about my coverage. It could be a few weeks after that before I could schedule a full physical. I had to leave work early again today and typing all this out is helping a little but I'm very scared right now.

I know this isn't a place for diagnosis or medical advise but I just wanted see how you all felt about this. Is it typical for people to have week long anxiety attacks? I had a few hours yesterday where I almost felt completely normal again but it all came back. I've only been eating a couple of handfuls of grapes and maybe a banana a day out of fear that I might worsen my condition. I've also noticed that keeping myself busy with something or walking around outside helps but both of my jobs require me to drive in trucks for most of my shifts.

36,"A family member of mine is always telling me how her friend is so much worse than me, cant leave the house due to her anxiety, can’t drive and can’t do anything for herself.

I know this friend. She goes on outings ALL the time (that she drives to) and she recently went on a holiday. My family member told me a couple of weeks ago that this friend has even started working cash in hand while also receiving government benefits. 

I don’t doubt that she does have mental health issues. But it’s really irritating me that I’m constantly being compared to her, when a lot of the things she says about her mental health aren’t even true.

37,"I have a regular twice-yearly check-in with my psychiatrist, who manages my medication for my depression and anxiety. However, I've never told him about my struggles with domestic abuse (it was in the past, I am safe now). I thought I had my anxiety under control and it didn't effect me, but for some reason for about the past 8 months I've been really struggling. I don't get much sleep because I get nightmares where I relive some of my worst moments. I get panic attacks any time I'm in loud areas or my brain makes some sort of connections to my abuse. More recently I've been having actual flashbacks, and it's really been taking a toll on me. 

I think these are all signs of PTSD, but I'm really unsure of how to talk about this with my psychiatrist. I'm going in for a regular check-in kind of thing, so he's not really expecting me to say anything is wrong, he just needs to see me a couple of times a year so he can sign off on my antidepressants. I'm just struggling with the actual wording of how I should bring it up. Should I mention that I think I have PTSD? Or should I tell him my symptoms and see if he thinks that's what it is? Should I bring it up, or should I wait to see if he asks me if there's anything bothering me?

38,"I live with a friend who is having mental health problems. He has been mostly holed up in his room but we passed each other in the door to our apartment yesterday and he just ran by me and turned his back to avoid looking at me and mumbled something about being in a rush. It really hurt my feelings because I felt invisible or unwanted and unwelcome. I know he's not feeling great and I dont expect a conversation or anything. Just for him to pause momentarily and acknowledge my existence and tell me he cant talk. We are normally very close but when he is not doing great he withdraws.

I'm legitimately not sure if this behavior is something I have a right to be upset about. Am I overreacting and making an small issue all about me?

I have severe anxiety issues and this triggers them every time. I made a stressed out comment when he did it. Something like "" what you're not even going to look at me then""? 

He later texted me that he just doesn't want to interact with anyone. 

But it stresses me out when I live with someone who is not even showing me what I would consider to be basic courtesy. I need another perspective since I have been ruminating between angry, her and guilty since yesterday and now I'm afraid to go home.

42,"I don't know where exactly to post this because it deals with so many different issues. I can think of at least 3 different subs where this could be relevant but this feels the most neutral.

I'm basically a 27 year old autistic that's struggled with ptsd, depression, and obsessive tendencies. Recently I've managed to get my obsessive tendencies under control through therapy and medication, but it turns out that it was not only a coping mechanism for my anxiety, but also the basis that fueled the passion for my interests.

Normally I'm into programming, building computers, video games, and doing small related projects. Particularly vintage stuff. I've intermittently lost or switched interests between them, but this is the first time in my life I feel completely burned out on them. All the passion and nostalgia that fueled it is gone. I've even tried to play my favorite ""when all else fails"" games, read tech articles, watch YouTube channels, but nothing works anymore.

Now, this wouldn't be a problem if I had something else to go to. I don't, I've tried broadening my interests for years but nothing really stuck. Piano, drawing, writing, volunteering at an animal shelter, etc. 

The obvious conclusion is that I'm depressed, but that's nothing new and now all I want to do is sleep anymore for no other reason than I'm bored.

Will my interests ever come back without the obsession? Is there a way to actually find another that sticks? Do I just need to get through the adjustment of not having an obsessive mind 24/7 anymore?

44,"So recently I have been diagnoses with two um, illnesses so far which are basically similar to another. Schizophrenia, Psychosis, and actually theres a lot more. Depersonalization, dissociation, derealization, depression, anxiety. And guess what none of my medication works. I havent had a single psychosis pill that has helped so far and I've been on well over 3-4 different ones. Anyways that's just context I guess. 

Recently theres been a few females who are on the opposite side of my political spectrum who have been attacking me in groups, verbally, for being white lol. I then tell them I'm sorry but thanks to my mental illnesses I react incorrectly many times but I do not change my political views on being offended. They then call me racist for some reason? Idk. They say having mental illnesses isnt an excuse to be like who I am? Interesting, so if I was Deaf I should just hear? Sounds good. I also honestly probably have BPD I wouldn't be surprised. And also amnesia or something. Sorry I'm just going on I guess lol. 

You know it really sucks having all these illnesses and I've gotten so used to them it feels normal. 24/7 I have an out of body experience.

None of it helps and no one understands how overwhelmed I am.

Mental illness, “a disease or period of sickness affecting the body or mind”. Mental illness is a little cockroach that creeped in there like a parasite. But, they can’t be surgically removed or killed. The disease is just there. There is no medication or treatment to fully help. I am mentally ill and there is nothing I can do. There is nothing. No treatment, medication, facility that will help. Just imagine a helpless maple leaf just being carried by the wind. There is absolutely nothing that will help. The only thing is that some days, things are better. I strive to make all days like that. 


What happened? What happened to humanity that they can’t make one part of the body not malfunction. No one has found a cure for, PTSD, DID, BPD, BD, or any other mental illness. I want to be better. I need to be better for my sake. I want to influence people and to make sure they know it gets better. But, how can I say that and not believe it. It is just the seedling, the little white lie. Is there something I did? Is this genetic? What are the causes? There are a number of endless questions. We never know what will come our way so we hide behind the rock. We don’t come out, not ever. 


We all suffer. Slowly going down the drain. We will all dissolve at one point. We all have our own problems that we can’t handle. Why is that? Why do we all need to suffer and bleed out in pain, just to be human? We developed from millions of generations of dinosaurs. They didn’t have mental illness, so why do we? Why do we need to constantly be in pain? Why are we even here? What was the point of that, to be here. Did someone mess with us?  Did God or the Devil mess with us to pay for what destruction we have done? Do we really deserve this?


My life has been a slow train slowly, and not knowingly about to crash. We all have our problems but why do we need too? Is there some sort of obligation? What is the point of depression, anxiety, stress? Why does life need to be stressful to be a life? We never deserve to be in such pain but we are anyway. We are human but not some rats in a lab. We can’t be mutated to be mentally ill. We are living, breathing, organisms that just want some joy. Why are some people better off than others?


We don’t deserve pain. We need nerves in our body but why do we feel pain? Is it “God’s Plan”? Will it happen in a few years that we will never feel pain anymore? I wish that I was healthy. I wish I was like the other girls, but why? Why do I think that so automatically. I am jealous of the girls walking around with their group of friends who love them and are true friends. Why can’t I have that? Do we really need friends? I like being alone but I am so lonely. I can’t tell anyone who I am. I just need something to get me through day.",16Feb2020,1

I've always been a little weird, like, goofy, but I could make people laugh, so I went with it. That was my job in the workplace, it was great, I had found my niche.  But I'm starting to realize that I'm treated differently by certain people. I've been depressed since I got out of high school, 2011, so now my mom has been ""walking on eggshells"" since then. Which I get, and I'm really sorry for, because she's here for me. She'll message ""I'm worried about you"" out of the blue, and if I postpone a visit because I have a cold, she'll assume the worst case scenario or that I'm lying to her. She also points out my symptoms quite a bit, like I sweat ***WAY*** too much because of the pills I'm on, but my doctor doesn't want to change them, or he didn't the last time I asked. And the pills work, apart from the sweating. It's like the smallest amount of physical exercise, bringing the groceries in, makes me sweat, and it lasts for a good 15 minutes each time. Sometimes I wake up clammy. It's brutal. So my mom will go ""you're melting"" like yeah I know, Sarah, Thanks. She'll also tell me to calm down, when I'm just telling a story. She thinks I'm very reactive, and she says it will interfere with my work.   


I've been out of work since last easter, when I told my boss I was depressed, but fortunately I had the most significant amount of money I'll ever have come in in the form of inheritance. So I've been living off of that, just coasting, figuring out where I'm going to live and what I'm going to do. I got yelled at for smoking weed at my mom's house, I was just a real shitty person all around, you know? But she still has me around. I love her. I'm going to hell.   


Anyway, I kind of get distracted a lot, you know? So my boyfriend brought home shopping and I accidentally left out a box of frozen ginger beef, and I found it today, and he found it after me, and he said ""I knew I should have checked that you put everything away"" which, fair enough, but it makes me think that he's always thinking of me as a spazz? It makes me feel like people are hyper aware of me which is not what I want.   


I'm also realizing that I was one of the special kids in school, I had problems in every school I went to, like I was very impulsive and I can remember 2 or 3 times that teachers just yelled at me for having a messy locker or cubby, like I would forget my lunch in there sometimes, and the teacher would just trash my locker in anger. Another time a teacher made fun of me because I didn't know my high up french numbers, like I just never learned. I was in french immersion, grade 7. Quatre-vinght-dix-neuf, that kind of thing. In grade 6 I would be taken out of class once a week for child therapy disguised as a puzzle with Miss Schneider, and the kid who whipped his dick out in grade 2. I freaked out at my mom when she got them to stop. I was not well adjusted. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was in scottish dance and soccer when I was little, but I quit both teams at once, I can't remember what I said to my mom but I was being bullied. Or, that's what the bully told me in high school when we met again. I believed her. I wasn't really good at either activity, but I look at adult scottish dancers now and I'm really envious, and I miss it.   


One time my best friend told me I smelled bad when the heat in the car was on, which I don't think is normal, but I was really deep in the depression hole at the time so I think that's forgivable. And my mom put me in a school that was not my first language, when I was 5. My mom and dad never lived together, so that probably didn't help. I'm just like....trying to learn to live for the first time  in 26 years.

54,"Hello, I'm looking for some advice on medicine I have bipolar disorder, asperger's syndrome, GAD, ADHD, OCD and agoraphobia.

My main issue lately has been anxiety. I have this constant feeling that's hard to describe. It's sort of like being on edge and feeling constantly alert. I guess you could say on the edge of your seat type of feeling. Along with this is feeling uncomfortable with like clothes bothering me or position of something in room bothering me thus triggering my OCD.

Another thing is that I've been having some problems with irritability and anger. They are pretty much all internal and I don't show them. Occasionally I'll tell my Mom who I'm close to. The irritability is just simply feeling annoyed at small things or whatever.  However the anger which is separate is like being unable to get over things/holding grudges.

Also, while it doesn't cause any problems or anything, I sometimes feel like I'm hearing background noise, like as if my Dad's watching TV in other room or something. When I actually notice the thought, I know it's not noise, so it's not really a hallucination. I think this has to do with that constant feeling of being on edge.

The main thing I'm concerned with is the anxious feeling. If the feeling isn't described clear enough to understand what it is, please ask me for more details.

The main psych meds I'm currently on are:

Adderall 20mg 3x/day (morning, mid-day, night) (for ADHD)

I feel SOOO tired all the time, especially when I have important things to do like clean or study. Right now I work part time and am getting my graduate degree full time, which is overwhelming. I sleep 9+ hours every night, and I still wake up immediately exhausted. I've even tried sleeping like 7 hours and it just made everything worse. I think I sleep so much because of my dysthymia and not being motivated to do anything.

59,"So background story. Right after I graduated high school I was not in a good mental state. I had a lot of mental break downs in a week. During that period of time I would listen to a certain subculture of mental music during the those mental breakdown. 

 I just need advice, now that I'm in a better mental state. I would like to go back and listen to some of those bands during that time period because I do like the music and miss listening to it. My problem is when I start listening to a song. I start to get into a depressive state.

One thing I’ve been thinking about is how many disorders and mental illnesses have such similar symptoms. In addition, people with mental illness tend to have a couple diagnoses. 

It just has me thinking: I wonder if many mental disorders and illnesses are kind of one in the same, but on different parts of the spectrum and expressed differently??

The following seven steps have started me on the process of self love - something that I am tremendously grateful for.  


**Step one**: Recognise how the past has led to my current behaviours and thought patterns.  
\- If I see the links from my past to now, I will know I am not fundamentally 'broken'.  
**Step two:** Acknowledge that I am human.  
\- Like everyone I make mistakes, and I am also capable of healing and growth.  
**Step three:** Be nice to my inner child (be my own parent).  
\- Give myself the things that I lacked growing up.  
**Step four:** Relax my high standards  
\- Stop holding myself to standards that I wouldn't hold others to (impossible standards).  
**Step five:** Stop comparing myself to others.  
\- I should only compare myself to myself. Personal growth is all that matters.  
    
**Step six:** Work on living in the present moment.  
\- Being mindful and present will help manage thoughts of the past/worry of the future.

**Step seven**: Forgive myself over and over again.  
\- For when I forget these lessons, for my mistakes and for everything that I would forgive others for as well.

65,"# Mental Health And The Work Place

&amp;#x200B;

Everyday thousands of people go to work, due their jobs to the best of their abilities and head home to their daily lives. Most people do not have to stop multiple times during their day to do a personal awareness check. Am I O.K? Am I doing my job correctly, and with efficiency? People with mental illness face inner challenges not seen by their peers or supervisors. It can be a very stressful life, getting up each morning hoping that the day will be a good one.

**I am one of the lucky ones.** I have an employer that is aware of my illness and takes steps to accommodate me when ever possible. I am in a profession that can be unsafe to work in if I am ill, by being either manic or depressed (Bipolar Disorder). I have explained to them what happens to me, and they do their very best to understand, and allow me the time off that I require when I am sick.

Workplaces can play an essential part in maintaining positive mental health. They can give people the opportunity to feel productive and be a strong contributor to employee well being. Yet in general it can also be a stressful environment that contributes to the rise of mental health problems and illnesses. No workplace is immune from these risks. Education on this subject is the best form of awareness. The giant wheel we call industry literally fathers our entire way of life. I find this fact impressive and amazing. Over many decades humans have crafted a society that affords all people the opportunity to participate and benefit through jobs and careers allowing them to enjoy the more important parts of life.

Unfortunately work can be so ingrained in our priorities that more often than not mental illness is overlooked, frowned upon or simply not accepted. Until recently I was guarded with my illness, but I would rather be up front with my peers when they ask why I missed work, or had to leave. There are also those who simply make unkind remarks or half hearted jokes. I have learned to be understanding with these people, as they simply have no experience with mental illness, and cannot understand why someone would miss work for reasons that they cannot physically see on the person who is ill.

There are many types of mental illnesses, and I can only speak personally about mine. I enjoy working and contributing as that is how I was raised, and how I raise my children. I developed bipolar disorder in my early twenties, and since then it has been a challenge to juggle this disorder and a career. I will however continue to do my very best to contribute gainfully as a member of society because that is what I deserve.",16Feb2020,1
66,"Been doing some soul searching lately and realized there might be more wrong with my head than I originally thought. Could use some help sorting it all out.

Sometimes when other people are going through something, I am there for them, but I’m not there with them. It feels like I only do what I’m doing to comfort them because I think it’s the right thing to do, and not because I actually care. That’s not saying I don’t feel empathy. I understand what they’re going through is hard, and I genuinely care about my friends and loved ones well being. I just can’t stop the thoughts that are like “I wish things were the way they were before this happened” or “I just want to get back to the show”. It makes me really upset with myself and guilty.

At the same time, I feel like I really read people well. I can always tell when someone is upset or if something is bothering them, and my first impressions of people are rarely disproven. When someone is down, I’m the first to ask them if they’re okay, and if they’re particularly upbeat, I ask them what’s up. I don’t know if that’s telling or anything, it’s just something I’ve noticed.

In high school I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and was also a self-proclaimed hopeless romantic. My therapist at the time stated that it seemed like I was only happy when I was in a relationship. I would find myself borderline obsessed with girls (not to the point of stalking or anything like that), like if I didn’t get their approval or get into a relationship with them I would get super depressed. I was in this friendship with a girl I claimed to be in love with for two years and the unreciprocation got to be so bad that I started feeling suicidal. Now that I’m in college and away from her it’s better, but I still hit really low lows and have a bad image of myself. That fixation has translated to other things too. Not nearly as bad, but I’ll find myself thinking something is super important and worth my time, and then within days completely forget or give up on it. My attention is really fleeting these days and I feel like my memory has gotten worse too.

I’ve also found myself to sometimes be a pretty angry person. It was worse when I was a kid, but I’ve learned to cope with it as I’ve grown up. It comes out every now and then though. I find myself getting frustrated really easily some days (although maybe that’s normal), but particularly with animals. I’ve never nor will I ever hurt one, but my gf and I were fostering this dog a while back who was really bad. She wouldn’t listen or learn and I would get really mad when my gf wasn’t around and yell at her. It’s not a side of me I’m proud of, and I hate when it comes out.

I feel like there’s something behind my behavior besides the aforementioned diagnoses, I just don’t know what. I originally went to therapy because I thought I might have bipolar disorder, since my cousin has it and I thought I had symptoms, but I left town before I could get a firm diagnosis. Even now I don’t have the money or time to find a professional therapist where I live, so I’m not sure what to do. Obviously there’s more to these stories but I was just hoping that someone might recognize some symptoms or something. Maybe I’m just thinking too much and watching too many videos about mental illness, but who knows.",16Feb2020,1
67,I was sleeping then I woke up around and hour after I got to sleep and had an urge to jump onto my neck and I was genuinely about to do it. I’ve not been able to sleep much though out this night. I’m just asking is anyone knows what’s wrong with me and if there is a way to help.,16Feb2020,1

69,"Hello again everyone. Today, I'm asking for some advice.

I've been having a rough time with the thought of relapsing. It's like one side of me craves drugs, but the other knows how bad it is for me and the people I care about. It causes a lot of cognitive dissonance and it's really getting to me.

Another thing in that sort of realm is one of the medicines I'm taking. I'm supposed to take 450 mg of Wellbutrin (Buproprion) a day. This caused a little bit of shakiness and general anxiety in me, so I continued at my typical 300 mg dose. However, I started going through a spell where I was so exhausted after even the slightest bit of exertion that I couldn't function. Since I knew Buproprion was my ""upper"" out of my medicine, I figured a bit more would help. I don't remember why, but I then though it would be a good idea to do 600 mg daily. This amount is damaging to my health. However, now I'm started to be taken over by thoughts of wanting more. I'm constantly shaking to some extent and am almost a ball of nerves, but then all I can think about is wanting more. I can't - I shouldn't but I have been known to take megadoses of medicines when I'm struggling (gave myself serotonin syndrome once), sort of like the drug binges of my past. I fear that I'm going to go through that again.

I don't want to relapse; I've been trying so hard to get better, but I'll be damned if I can ever get to a ""normal"" mindset again.

Advice? Comments? Any and all is welcome. Thank you so much.",16Feb2020,1
70,"For those who haven't seen my previous posts, I have a history with sexual assault. But my ex was the one who got furthest away... I'll tell in detail my particular story with him.

He's a guy who's studied tons of books on how to persuade people and how brain works, and at first I thought of it as a reality interesting thing as I find the human brain absolutely fascinating, it's an incredible organ. But that's not the point, the thing is that I think he used his knowledge to manipulate me into being in denial and not acknowledging what he actually did to me. On our third date we kissed for the first time and my Uber app did not work, so I couldn't get back home. It was already 2 in the morning and staying out in the street waiting for my app to respond so I could get a ride was not a good option. So as his ride was quite close, he said I could go to his place and order my ride from there, I didn't have going to his place in mind that night, but I was more scared of being on the street alone on my own than accepting his offer, then I told him I would only accept if he understood that me going to his place didn't mean we were going to have sex that night, he told me he was ok with that and that I shouldn't worry about it. So I accepted and we went to his place, my app was still unresponsive and he wouldn't offer me to use his instead and pay for it cash at my drop out point, no, he saw mine wasn't working and started kissing me, I kissed him back as I did like him. But then he started getting more sexually aggressive and suddenly, without any previous warning started trying to finger me (I was wearing a skirt), I said no and moved, he asked me if I didn't like it and I just replied I didn't want it to happen that night. He stopped for a few seconds and kept on trying and trying and trying and I kept on saying no, I was scared already by that point. Then I went to the bathroom hoping that would help his hormones go down a little bit and calm down, but then when I came out of the bathroom he was naked from his waist down, I was in shock, I asked him why did he do that and his answer was: weren't you curious? I mean now you won't be curious about it anymore... I was terrified, tried to ignore him and to make my app work again, but it didn't and he started kissing me again and trying to put my hand on his cock, I didn't want to touch it but I felt really intimidated, he pulled me to sit on his lap facing him and started kissing me, I responded to his kisses, but I was terrified, he started trying to finger me repeatedly again and I kept on rejecting his advances, until I decided the best thing I could do would be telling him I really didn't have any energy at all and just needed to sleep, to please let me sleep(I had no other choice, it was either staying there or risking other people on the street doing much worse to me, I live in a really dangerous city), and that seemed to have worked, but he said we should cuddle then (he slept, I couldn't sleep). The next morning I just wanted to go back home but he started trying again, kissing me and finger banging me, I didn't want to and said now a few times but then I just gave up, I was scared and feeling worn up, he kept on insisting until I eventually gave up and didn't put any resistance anymore. It really did hurt, he finger banged me and he was really rough and I told him it was rough and he said that was the way he was supposed to do it so I could find pleasure, I had to fake an orgasm, but I really only wanted it to stop and to go home, well then he pulled up a condom and proceeded to penetrate me, I again had to fake an orgasm so he'd let me go, then he came and stopped. I felt so uncomfortable! Well I took a shower and then when I got out he made breakfast for me. I told myself after leaving his place that maybe it was just an awkward sexual encounter and was in denial for a few months and kept on dating him. A few dates after that episode he told me about will power and timing on food and how people's will power wears down when they haven't eaten for more than X amount of hours and stuff, that has been echoing in my head a lot lately when I remember what happened that first time ""we had sex"" (actually my therapist told me it was rape, but sometimes I doubt myself when using that term, but I do feel raped indeed), he waited until I was too tired to fight him so I'd let him do it! He knew the will power theory and everything and still did what he did. Then during the 3 months I kept on dating him because I was still in denial, he would sometimes drop comments about women who claim being raped after having consensual sex and then regretting it and how sucky that was, how he hates those women because they had no credibility and how his dad was an amazing lawyer, he did try a few sexual things without asking me for my consent before doing them and when I told him it was the first time that happened to me he replied ""isn't that the point of it all?"", he would never listen to the things I told him I didn't like him to do to me and he'd constantly do them to me, one of them I told him several times too and he'd always say he'd stop doing it the day I don't laugh at it, but my laugh was involuntary and nervous and I tried explaining that to him, but he always ignored it saying it was a lie, that if I laughed was because I liked it and then try to turn things around by saying I didn't do a certain thing he wanted me to do, or that I was being unnappreciative of what he did for me and stuff (he always complained about him being an amazing friend, relative or son and people being unnappreciative and insensitive about it), when I didn't do exactly what he wanted when he wanted he would throw on tantrums acting like a f***ing child, pouty faces, manipulating me with not being affectionate and stuff like that... The last tantrum was like a week before he left this country and he tried to force unprotected sex on me, I was terrified, I thought he was going to violently rape me, he ignored my no's several times trying to penetrate me with no condom but I moved rejecting him and saying no repeatedly until he got mad at me and went to sleep really annoyed. He always insisted we keep in touch after he left because ""he thought he was be a person who could bring a lot of good things to my life and help me in many ways"" and as I was still in denial, I accepted. He kept on talking to me every day as if we were together, but we were not anymore, after some time I started feeling really uncomfortable about it, and thinking about what happened when he was here, and started feeling disgusted but guilty about not wanted to talk to him anymore, then started going to therapy and finally blocked him from everywhere. His response to that was sending me an SMS from another number asking me to tell him why did I bock him after ""everything he did for me"" and after being such an important part of each other's life, I was terrified and didn't want to tell him as I'm well aware he'd never say it to my face and recognize what he did (sexually assaulting me)...

Am I just going crazy?",16Feb2020,1
72,"My depression magically went away. I’m feeling emotions that I haven’t felt in years

I don’t even know how to start this. My name is kat, I just turned 19 and I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety at the age of 13. I tried killing myself on Valentine’s Day of 2019. I was over weight growing up and as a 5’11 female, people were never nice to me. I didn’t have a problem with how I looked, but others really did. I didn’t know my appearance was such a disgrace, until I got into high school. Freshman year I was so alone and bullied to the point where I stopped eating and developed anorexia. I dropped 50 pounds in the matter of 3 months. The school didn’t do anything and I ended up transferring. It got worse at the school I transferred to. I would get harassed by the football players and groped or called horrible names by them. It was like a really bad toxic relationship that I was battling. Except it was with the whole football team and anybody else who had an opinion about me. Everyday I would hide in my sweat pants and baggy sweaters. I wanted to be hidden so bad. I hated dressing up or looking too “put together” because I didn’t want people to notice my outfit and then notice all the flaws that came with me as a person. I wasn’t diagnosed but I feel as if I had really bad body dysmorphia. Everything I did revolved around how I looked. I would spend 2 hours every morning on my makeup , and if something was off about it — I wouldn’t go to school. Or I would get extremely PHYSICALLY sick to my stomach and not be able to leave the house. If I did have the confidence to go to school, I would leave mid day. I missed about 48% of my high school experience (according to my 4 year attendance card). I was hardly ever at school. Growing up I was always into modeling, music, dance and any type of art. I was a friendly introvert. I always saw the best in people and never judged anybody by how they looked because I was always the “underdog” too. So I was nice to everyone but I was shy at first. The ball happened to roll into my court and I started to get recognized online for my “beauty”. I gained thousands and thousands of followers on Instagram and yet I still wasn’t happy with how I looked and I still felt so horrible about myself. I was tormented- bullied- and posted about online for the full 4 years, until I graduated. Sounds like a horrible high school sitcom but people boo’d at me as I walked my graduating stage. There was actually a hate page (that is still up to this day) with over 70k followers. This page strictly posts vile and horrible things about me and people follow it for amusement. I guess to summarize and make it short. 

I hated myself. I wanted to die. Everyday. I fucking hated life. Every little fucking thing about life. I looked in the mirror and wanted to fucking off myself. Every. Fucking. Day. I couldn’t stand seeing my reflection. I was bullied so fucking bad that I got so numb and started believing everything that was being said to me. I was such a pure fucking person and people ruined that. And I hate everyday that I gave people the power to fuck with my life like that. 

I hated seeing others smile. I didn’t understand why others got sad after a heart break. I didn’t understand why people got happy when they got a raise. I would get so envious and irritated at laughter because I didn’t understand why others were able to feel that way— when I couldn’t. It sounds harsh, I know. Luckily I never portrayed these feelings outwardly, but my mind is so fucking dark. 

But fast forward. 

It’s 02/15. A year and a day since my suicide attempt. And I feel like my life literally changed in a day. Like some weird universe shit. Like as if I had to complete a full year of tragedy and loneliness, in order to feel emotions again. Not even trying to be corny, but I feel happy again. And it’s really hard to explain, if you’ve never felt the depression “numbness” before. But it’s like you’re stuck on autopilot. And you’re just a bystander to your own life. I didn’t feel that this morning and I feel like everything that I felt in my past was so irrational and all the things people have done to me, doesn’t matter anymore. I have tried to get to this train of thought for YEARS. I’ve tried everything. Drugs, exercise, laughter, sex— nothing ever worked. I was still numb and felt like I was living in some type of simulation. And now all of a sudden, I wake up and now I’m seeing life for what it is? I’m excited. I’m so grateful for every little thing now. And I guess idk why I wrote this whole thing .. I just needed answers or maybe somebody who could relate to me?  Idk who to talk to about this feeling because I don’t know if anybody would ever understand or if it even makes sense. Sometimes I just feel like I’m this extraterrestrial being, that nobody can relate to because I feel like I process things differently.

75,"Hi guys. Recently I've not been doing alright. I've been thinking about talking to a professional but I almost feel it's a bit overkill.

I just don't seem to have any strong feelings about anything at the moment, I sort of feel blank. Anything I care about happens in the summer. I know it's probably a bad case of S.A.D but I'm just sort of... bored of everything. 

I'm in an alright spot in life right now; I'm meant to be at uni but I just can't get the energy to drag myself out of bed. I feel like I can easily learn my course (computer related) online using the uni resources and Google.

I've been meaning to get out to go to the gym but every time I make dumb excuses like 'my shorts aren't clean enough' and 'it's too windy outside'

Any hobbies I have I get bored of/lose focus after an hour or so and all I really feel like doing is playing games.

My boyfriend knows when it’s happening and just tells me to get it all out and I’ll shake my legs like crazy or something. 

I can have whole days like this maybe even a week. I don’t get super depressed so I don’t think I’d be bi polar but I do get in blahh boring moods. I’m generally a happy person although I have pretty bad anxiety.

77,"My brain has the tendency to exaggerate the overall negativity of a certain situation and always moves towards how horribly anything can go as opposed to how it can end positively.

It's been like this for several years. I switch between two moods. Its either I think so highly of myself (to the point where people find me arrogant) or I think of myself as trash. I've been prescribed pills once by my therapist at my country's mental institution, fluvoxamine, if I recall correctly. I never took the pills because the general opinion towards the idea was negative. My mother was convinced me I didnt need them and so I threw them away. Now I'm beginning it question if I should've done what the doctor told me to.

I'm 23. I'm on my first year of university and I hate that. I know I should be grateful that I even have the opportunity to get a degree but I'm still sad that i didn't get to go overseas like all my friends have and I know that I shouldn't have this mindset because comparison is the death of joy. 

I was born into a religion I never truly believed in and that has constantly been the source of contention between me and my very pious mother who currently hates me because I confessed to my lack of faith. To make the situation worse, she despises my current girlfriend because of her faith, race and what she did to me once 4 years ago (which was leaving me in the 2nd week of my mandatory national service amidst my parent's legitimate divorce and dire financial straits).

That aside, I was always able to keep my head on straight (mostly) but what has pushed me to the edge was the suicide of my closest friend on the 3rd of October. She was the only person in the world who I'd truly take a bullet for. On that day, at 11.51PM she called me to let me know that she loved me and gave me an address. Upon arrival, all I found was her corpse. 

This seems like it's all over the place but I just want to know if I'm depressed, do I have a problem, do I have a right to be sad? 

I'm in no way craving death but I really dont mind it and sometimes i even fancy the idea. I have constant dreams and daydreams about the different ways I do myself in and as the days pass I'm beginning to think to myself, ""maybe my friend had the right idea.""

In the past few years, it just feels like I'm not doing anything right. I'm insecure, I'm furious and I feel alone. Should I seek professional help?",16Feb2020,1
78,"FWIW, I've been told I have a very rigid thought process and have been diagnosed with Asperger's as a child (though it was never addressed and the diagnosis has since been dismissed numerous times). I also do not know how to form my own views and opinions based on things I'm told and things I read - everything is taken in its entirety or completely dismissed. None of my therapists have seen this as an issue and therefore I have nowhere to turn for help with it.

I've been in DBT, a residential treatment center, intensive outpatient, AA, and outpatient therapy. Because I've dealt with abusive family members completely dismissing anything a therapist told them that they didn't like, I feel like I have to take everything seriously, otherwise I'm wasting both of our time and not willing to get better. Unfortunately, I don't filter ANYTHING and that means I have to process what I heard in therapy for MONTHS. Whenever I attempt balancing what I've learned in multiple places, it doesn't work because I'm still giving ideas value that I probably should drop. 

DBT says that volunteering is a way to build positive experiences and self-image. Intensive outpatient said volunteering is a form of narcissism because we do it to feel good about ourselves, and is therefore not healthy.

Residential treatment taught me that participation by listening is a healthy boundary when you're too tired or not in a good mood. Intensive outpatient says this is selfish and if you're choosing to be in group therapy, your peers are entitled to your feedback. Outpatient therapist says some things aren't even worthy of a response in the first place.

DBT taught me how to get my needs met by setting boundaries, since most relationships with people we have issues with need to stay in our lives (bosses, parents). Residential taught me that no, you actually don't need to have those people in your life - quitting your job and cutting off your parents IS an acceptable boundary. Intensive outpatient took it a step further and said that if you don't do this, you're choosing to stay stuck.

Residential and DBT talked about how it's okay to slip up, acknowledge what you did wrong, forgive yourself, and move forward. AA equated self-forgiveness with a lack of accountability - if you slip up once, you're back at square 1.

My IOP facility in particular set me back several notches - I had only just gained a shred of self esteem at residential when a therapist (note: not MY therapist) told me I had antisocial personality disorder in group therapy and lead a psychoeducation group on how to get your needs met by ""a person like me."" I do feel like some of it was helpful, though. I wound up asking my friends if they thought I was selfish and every single one said I was either selfish or inconsiderate. Since I went there, my relationships and friendships are 10x better - but I don't know how to let go of the toxic shit I was fed there without also letting go of what's helpful. 

How much am I allowed to disagree with what I'm told before I'm not willing to get better?",16Feb2020,1
80,"I think I spend a good chunk of my day accidentally thinking about embarrassing or upsetting moments, so I’ve coped by imagining me crumpling up the memory and throwing it away or shoving the memory into the deepest parts of my brain. Placebo or not I believe it works and I tend to not think about it for a while or forever but in that process I feel like I’m losing memories of good ones or even every single moment I had with someone I don’t talk to anymore. I ended a relationship and a friendship in the past year and I’ve almost completely erased every single memory I have of them. I know we knew each other but otherwise I can hardly remember anything. I know I’ll never stop coping by “erasing” my bad memories or feelings but I’m afraid I might lose more important memories I have. For now I’m thinking of just getting a diary to write important and meaningful memories into in case I forget those too. But otherwise, I’m not too sure. I’m afraid of the thought of possibly losing memories but I’m also not keen on trying to remember the memories I did want to erase...",16Feb2020,1

I've broken up harshly with my gf, burned my arms to make them uglier, threw away things that were expensive. Every time after I regret it so much because of how dumb it is.

My best friend admitted themselves after a particularly hard week about two months ago. They also have bpd so everything is just intensified. 

We were watching Horse Girl and I commented on how the mental health ward looked in the movie. They said they wished they got to stay in a room half as nice when they were admitted. They told me the rooms were cells. No windows. Dark. Doors locked from the outside. Yelling and strange noises could be heard in the hallway. No one seemed to care much. 

How can an environment like that help mental health? it only makes it worse. It makes it so you lie to your counsellors and nurses so you can get the hell out of there.

87,"Ever since high school I've always kept to myself and never really went out of my way to really talk to anyone I wasn't already friends with.  If I'm walking in someone's direction I'll stare right through them like they aren't there.

After graduating, it continued to get worse.  I stopped checking social media and hardly ever touched my phone.  Acceptance from others isn't my problem, I'm generally a likeable guy.  I just don't really.. care. About anyone or anything.

I got married to a girl I'd been with since middle school, and I assumed I had all I needed.  After some months she said she hasn't really liked me for a while and just kind of split.

That's when things got exponentially worse.  I've changed my number countless times just so no one would have it, but my mother keeps giving it out.  I've started ghosting family, and I can see how much it concerns them, but I don't have it in me to care.  I don't know where it comes from.

Recently I put a post on Reddit and it hit r/all , I had fun talking to people for a while and even met a really cute girl and some awesome people online.  But I can *feel* another isolation episode coming. I know it's only a matter of time before I delete whatever social media I have and change my number.

  I go weeks without seeing family and literal years without speaking to snyone else.  I'm content with only seeing people at my job and they love me, and honeslty that's all I need.

I wouldn't know what this would be considered.  I was diagnosed bipolar as a child, but I haven't been evaluated since.  I'm not a harm to anyone or myself, my apathy just won't let me care about other people I guess.

89,"This week, I met a person online who needs professional help for their mental state. Yesterday, they told me deeply personal issues that they have and essentially poured their heart out to me. It was to the pint where I had to drop everything I was doing to stay with them and get them to a good mental state. It caused me great distress, and they had caused me to stay up much later than I was comfortable with even after I mentioned that I needed to sleep multiple times.

I won't share exactly what they said on here, as their issues aren't for me to share. What I will say is that I told them I could help them get professional help and that I am not a professional. They declined. Today, something similar happened, and again I had to drop what I was doing. Yet again, I had to stay up incredibly later just to help this person get to a mentally better place, all the while they would not seem professional help even when I asked them to. Keep in mind, I haven't known this person for a full week yet. I want to help, but at the same time, I know this isn't something I am qualified or able to do. I can't keep staying up every night in distress trying to help them, it's just not something I am able to do right now. 

Tomorrow I'm going to explain to them that I can't continue doing this, and then offer them resources that can help them cope with their issues. How should I go about this? What resources should I offer? I need to make it clear that I cannot be their only mental support, and that what we've been doing the past two nights is something I cannot do anymore.

95,"(sorry if I write badly, I'm from Argentina and I'm learning). I am 18 years old and this year I suffered from depression and anxiety. I was far from almost all the people I know, although sometimes I left my house to join someone, mostly as a necessity imposed by myself. I know that sometimes I have to see and talk to people, although I love being alone and I always enjoy it. but in a moment things got worse. my mother once in response to my concern about becoming ""crazy"" (I was smoking a lot of weed and at some point I couldn't stop thinking, my thoughts became loud and unbearable, to the point that I thought I could become schizophrenic) he told me ""If you think too much about going crazy, you will become one."" That phrase, that phrase stuck in my head. I had stopped reading books (a true passion, especially dostoevsky) and, in general, I stopped enjoying anything. My anxiety reached the point of not seeing a future. Even if the world right now feels increasingly dead, I still want to experience and live the last moments. The problem is that this possibility did not exist for me, since the problem was internal and had no solution. For those who think, why didn't you go to therapy? My family barely has any money, and with inflation in my country, prices rose very high. As you may know, in a few countries mental health is taken seriously. continuous. At this point I am almost certain that I am schizophrenic since there is no obvious distinction between thoughts and voices, because in reality there is no such distinction. (Among all this, I also thought it was bipolar. And I know that it is silly to analyze and give these answers without any psychiatrist involved, but understand the anxiety and fear that was happening). It seems as if your thoughts turn against you, especially with anxiety attacks. Over time the only solution I found, after realizing that I didn't want to talk to my friends and I didn't want to see anyone I know, partly because even before the problem I didn't consider them as friends and sincerely preferred to be alone, it was going out from my house. You don't need to look for friends because you need help and you feel lonely, you have to experience a little more simple things and stop thinking constantly about yourself, because that way you will live asking yourself the same questions that have no way out. The only way to achieve this is to leave your home, you have to run and eat well. Reading is very important, because it is a great way to calm anxiety, and like music is something that anyone can be entertain.it is important that Culture enters our life. and believe me that I know how much it costs to leave home, at least I was lucky enough to know since I was little what my passion is and the only thing that saved me during the journey, the only thing that made me leave again.


 In time I calmed down, since I discovered that the solution was to give myself to the only things that I was passionate about, books, photography, and especially cinema. I will improve partly because I read again and because I started working on short films filming the streets of my neighborhood and taking pictures. I also go to film festivals and im constantly meeting new people in the streets. The anxiety diminished and with the help of people I could at least calm all these thoughts and the paranoia in which I constantly lived. All this puts you to think about the dangers of this loop, and the fear of how much one can dissapear from reality in dark times.",16Feb2020,1

101,"It would take way more than a reddit post to explain everything, so I'll leave as much as I can out.

I have worked since 15 at many jobs, never lasting more than a couple months. I start off optimistic, but eventually snowball into no-showing. I'm 18 now, and just quit my job. I liked it. Had an amazing boss, good coworkers, and it was the best pay I could get out of HS. No real reason for me to quit. On my way to work, I was hoping a car would hit me so I wouldn't have to go to work.

I've done this at a lot of jobs now, and I have been trying to figure it out. Context (I'll try to keep it short) : I spent Elementary school between schools and short/long term care facilities. I had violent outbursts almost every day. Tried a couple meds, had bad side effects. Eventually I think general aging and realizing the path I was heading down made me slowly calm down. If I told you about what I did as a kid in person you'd think I'm lying, as I'm the most reserved, shy, awkward guy ever. 

I still struggle with... Something. Anxiety, stress, depression. Is it one thing that causes the others? A little bit of all of them? If I had to guess my anxiety is the worst - runs in my dad's side, and schizophrenia in my mom's, great. The depression kicks in harder than the anxiety when I am alone with time to think. So I can't relax. I always have to be doing something, as downtime leads to bad thoughts. 

Back to the point. I think my anxiety is the worst and the cause of the other stuff. I think as a kid, I interpreted it as fear. Thus the outbursts. But what the hell can I do to work on it? I can't afford therapy - especially not without a job now - and I don't see my doctor until May. It's a new doctor, so I doubt they'd want to put me on meds after first meet. they'd probably want me to see a therapist because what, do I need antidepressants? Anti anxiety?

It fucking sucks. I'm always anxious about something. And I'm just terribly socially as well. Can't make eye contact. Can't hold a conversation. Definitely can't start a conversation. One of the only things keeping me going is a drive to want a relationship. But that's hard with no friends, and never messaging anyone first on apps. Oh, on that note, friends as well. What the fuck are they and how do they work. I never had one through school, everyone had their own cliques. I can't hold a job so coworkers can't really be ""friends"". So how? Meetup.com? That would never go over well for me. 

I know I would never commit suicide - I'm far too logical and know the negatives always outweigh the benefits. But if I didn't think that way, I might have tried by now. I'm always going to be struggling. All my energy will be to counter my anxiety, holding conversations, and figuring out what thoughts of mine are anxiety and what ones are mine. But god I just want to know why, regardless of if I can change it, I'm like this and what it is. Just really bad anxiety? I have no clue and I hate that I don't.",16Feb2020,1

103,"Mental health Suicide poem

I sit by the river and look to the sky,
imagining the feeling and asking myself why.

What gives you the strength to end it all,
when did you life hit the metal wall.

Our eyes are the window to our soul,
were yours clouded like a deep misty hole.

Why did the system let you so badly down,
depression is not just a temporary frown.

Imagine a time that we can talk  to one another,
whether its a doctor, child or your a brother.

Tears would be shed and a problem halved,
a memory in your heart would be calved.

Too many life's are being destroyed,
families torn apart and left with a void.

If we can learn from you in any way,
to help the thoughts float away.

I don't know your name or who you belong,
but the Mental health system has got it so wrong.

It effects  many families so far and wide,
lets come together and diminish suicide.

106,"Hi,

 It's my fist post and it's kinda long..apologies in advance.

So I've been with my therapist for 4 yrs now and for the most part she's been really great. She helped me a lot especially when I had extreme suicidal thoughts and when I was self harming..

I must say sometimes it felt like she didn't know exactly what to do with me when I was in those situations but she did her out most best, always worried about me..

She told me during those 4 yrs that **I don't have depression**. That my life has just been objectively hard and that with enough hard work and change of environment I can move on and have a balanced life.

For a while I tried to believe that. But no matter how I looked at it trough the years I thought **she is terribly mistaken**.

I went through a rough life..I won't elaborate too much but the first time I wanted to cease to exist I was in the third grade. I cried almost everyday since I can remember myself.. At first at reasonable things like bulling or being hit at home or just being lonely (started at first to second grade)..But then I started to cry just for being alive when I didn't want to.. 

I read a lot. Not just on the internet, mainly books.

Anything from self help to psychology (not the popular but the academic ones) to poetry to novels.. I even watch a lot of Ted talks about depression and suicidal thoughts and anxiety, all to find every time how much I relate to these topics in my daily life.

It was a form of extra self therapy I did with myself. Always looking for new ways to get better and see what others in similar circumstances did to better themselves.

I charted daily activities to track habits and feelings, got apps for mental health and self betterment and I even had it for a while..some sort of balance..I meditated and exercised and ate healthy and got off addictive generic ssri pills (that were given to me by a sketchy doctor) that didn't help me and brought me nothing but nasty side effects.. all to be a functional adult..I really tried!

I'm  in college now..And ever since I'm there I fell to a stronger never ending depressive episode ..lost all of my good habits bit by bit.. my thoughts escalated .Even though ""on paper"" everything is fine, two weeks ago I started a draft of a plan of sorts, of the things I'll need to do before I go.

I told my therapist ( she's a psychologist) after months of terrible mood not changing and she told me to meet her more often.

I can't quite afford the treatment. and I pay the same (relatively low) price over the 4 yrs which stayed constant (after a while they're supposed to rise it periodically in my country) and in really bad times she would see me for an even lower price or for free. (which even though somewhat helpful, it made me feel extremely uncomfortable in these conditions). 

She also told me to see a psychiatrist to start medical treatment (more pills) but here's the thing!

**She doesn't believe me to have depression!** 

So, wait, I don't have a mental illness!? I'm not sick!? 

How the hell can that be when I've been struggling with this my entire life?! 

Let's see.. low energy on a daily basis? check! terribly sad moods that continue for more the two weeks in arow? check! 

feeling hopelessness on a daily? check!

 sleeping too much or too little? check! 

feeling uneasy with people around me? feeling like a burden? like the world is better off without me? that I'm never good enough? avoiding people around me? talking of mortality? frequent crying? not wanting to leave the house? daily tasks come at great difficultly or at times I'm unable to do them at all because I'm too sad or stressed to even watch TV let alone leave my bed ?? self harm? feeling like I want to die (or more accurately I don't want to live)?!?! check and check!

She knows all of this of course and yet claims that though I may not have depression, I have a tendency for depressive behavior in my personality or some thing like that

Oh.... excuse me, I guess I don't have depression I guess I just suck as a person?!

I don't know how to take this info or how to process that at all..

She says I cannot be defined as having depression because I am able to somewhat function and go to work (I'm not stupid I need the money even though it takes a terrible emotional toll) and that I still have my survival instinct about me in when push gets to shove (well, knowing hunger and abuse will do that to you) or something among the lines of ""you're too strong and stable to be considered sick"" ....But my strength is weaning! I don't know how long I'll be able to hold it.

She claims that there has been an escalation (no shit) and I may need the pills even though I'm not really sick. ""It's just something to help me cope until I get back on my feet"".

For me there is no getting beck.. I almost had it in my grasp! a balanced life friends..my dream job!

all gone to an illness I don't have that I still need to be medicated for!

quick disclosure- mental illness runs in my family! from my grandma to My mom who is popping meds like cereal! 

I don't want to be medicated if I'm not sick and to have addiction to drugs that don't help and make me fat for no reason!

Plus, if I am sick, I need a name for the daemon  I've been struggling with! Isn't that how exorcism works? I'm not religious but they really had a point there! Name the problem so you can know how treat it no?

I have been fighting with her over this for a month now and It's going nowhere.. No matter what she says to rationalize her claims..I can't hear her. It's like everything she says looses context..I challenged her as a person and as a professional..still she wants to help..I don't get it..

This just feels like a betrayal for some reason..and the feeling is strong and bitter..If I had anyone to help me find the way to balance then, it's gone now and even though she stretches out a hand I don't want to take it..",16Feb2020,1

108,"I live in a building of 9 floors and live on the 6th floor

A few weeks ago, i heard a fire alarm. There are only detectors in people's apartments.  
It usually happens when people are cooking and burn something and forget to open their windows  
But normally it stops after a few seconds, max 15-30 seconds  
This time, it was going on for more than 2 minutes  
I looked outside the window and down, i saw smoke coming out of an apartment on the 4th floor  
I started panicking because i thought of this situation a few days ago, i don't know why  
I put on my shoes and went in the hall and stairs and smelt burnt   
So i thought i can't use the elevator because it's non recommended during a fire and i didn't want to take the stairs in case there were dangerous smokes.  
So i really started to panic   
Anyway to be sure, i called firefighter line and explained the situation.  
They advised me to go downstairs and check and knock on the neighbors. There was just burnt smells but not smokes so they said it was ok.  
So i went downstairs and knocked at the door, the neighbor opened and yeah it was only burnt bread.  
After that, i had to lie down 2-3 hours on my bed to calm down and i thought of it a little days after.  
Then i stopped thinking of it until today. 

Why am I telling this story ? Because 2 weeks ago, i was stuck in the traffic and i started to panic. I don't like to be stuck somewhere on in a situation where i cannot extract myself easily. But this time it was real hard time. I had to pullover once and then on the motorway, i really had the feeling i would faint and have an accident. And last week, i started having chest pain just where the heart is and also 2 nights where i felt like i was choking and could not breathe. I even went twice to the emergency, once sent by my doctor for a check up. And everything from a « physical » view is ok.  
The choke feeling last days seems to come only when i'm resting or alone not talking to someone. But when i'm busy out of home or with people, i don't think of it. And i think it grows when i'm home  
I only understood today that maybe this is post traumatic stress after the supposedly ""fire"" incident

  
My doctor has put me on medications and gave me names of comportemental psychotherapists but I won’t have an appointements before weeks probably

Has anyone been like this kind of situation/« PTSD » ? How did you live this ? What are the advices you got ?  
We plan to move in a different city, in a house (it was planned before the incident) in may but i'm thinking : is it a good option to leave this place earlier because it would be good to go out of this ""toxic"" zone where i experienced the stress/trauma ?

Thank you",16Feb2020,1

A thought popped into my head telling me that I could end up being alone forever, and I couldn't cope with it. I started crying uncontrollably, experienced heavy anxiety,  and I felt this massive feeling of self hatred and insignificance. It got so bad that I split myself into three alter egos (with names, and very distinct personalities) that night, and functioned as them for the entirety of the next day. This was a very very odd experience because I'm usually a very composed individual. Even when drunk I usually have a lot of control over my actions but I completley lost it yesterday. I felt as if ""I"" as a person didn't exist, and my ego's would refer to me the progenitor. They'd say things like ""the progenitor was so damaged that he left, and put us in charge."" I know this all sounds so crazy. Now, I'm feeling a bit better, and I'm back to being my whole self but I still feel kind of ""off"".

116,"I feel like I've been subjected to endless gaslighting and emotional manipulation since I was a child.

I have been seeing professionals since I was eight, for meltdowns and tantrums. I've been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, Tourette's, depression, and ADHD at various times by various professionals (I did not carry all diagnoses at once).

Now I only am diagnosed with OCD and Asperger's. I'm almost twenty-one, and suffer severe anxiety because I'm constantly afraid that whatever I'm doing at any given point in the day is pathological. I've become a walking mental health diagnosis. 

The bipolar dx was the worst. I was dxed at age thirteen with little to no explanation or elaboration. The doctor also dxed me with ADHD and Tourette's in a span of minutes via a cosmopolitan type quiz that I filled out. She had me on three meds and tried to put me on three more. No meds for anxiety, unfortunately. 

I am terrified of severe mania and psychosis. My parents think I'm being ""dramatic"", and what happened to me is ""not that bad."" They don't understand how serious a bipolar diagnosis really is, and that it's considered chronic. My mom keeps saying that even if I did have a manic episode at some point, I'm never going to have one again because ""it hasn't happened yet."" (?) They don't understand why I'm upset with my old doctor. I've been screamed at and slapped by my mom when having anxiety attacks and crying at night. And they wonder why I'm depressed...

Now I'm being pressured to go on SSRIs, which I was told for four years or so was the one class of medication I could never take. (Stimulants were okay though, apparently.) A doctor I saw at school told me that suffering was ""my choice."" I've tried to explain how much backlash I'd gotten from my mother and doctor for years at the suggestion of SSRIs and how anxious it made me, but I was dismissed and scolded.

I've been told that the trick is to ""stick with one doctor"" and ""not go doctor shopping"". Well, if I'd done that, I'd still be on 3-6 meds and sporting a ton of random dxes. Also, I was not ""doctor shopping"" at twelve years old. I was moving, doctors were finding new jobs, retiring, etc. ""Stick with one doctor"" is ridiculous advice given turnover rates due to factors we can't control. ""Self-diagnosis"" is also bad, only a doctor can diagnose me, but when they do, they do so in a matter of minutes, and no one can agree on anything. I get spun around and around in circles, then stripped of my agency and scolded when I try to take a stand.

What is the matter with this system? I feel worse than I did going into it. How do I reclaim my agency and feel confident again? I'm in despair, and the people who were supposed to help me won't acknowledge their role in creating that despair. :(",16Feb2020,1

119,"My (27F) boyfriend (31 M) is depressed and being bullied. How do I help him?

My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. He's always struggled with life, though you'd never tell. He has a successful career and is well liked amongst his friends but often comes home and just sits near silently for hours before going to bed.
I tried to talk to him and he tells me he's just tired from putting on a display of happiness for everyone all the time and wants to be alone.

On his good days he's very attentive and does whatever I ask of him. I love him so much and it is so hard to see him struggle on his bad days.

He was at bar for a friend's birthday recently but came home early, having only stopped for 3 or 4 beers. 
It seems so stupid now but I ended up causing an argument because he'd not given the night out a chance.
We argued and he threw a mug at me which caught the side of my head. I ran out of the house and into the car where I stayed for half a hour. He didn't follow me and this is the first time he's ever done anything like this during an argument. We don't even argue that often.

Some nosy neighbour must have called the police because after the half hour they turned up, saw my head and lead my boyfriend away. I told them it was nothing and I'd slipped but my boyfriend told them the truth.

Now it's all over town and my boyfriend is being treated like some evil wife beater! His attention seeking ex has been all over Facebook claiming he was constantly violent to her too. It's all lies. 

He's a good man and this is a making his life worse. I've told police I don't want to pursue anything but they said they have to act because he admitted it. It's like they are determined to ruin his life over this.

Both times they were looking into a possible diagnosis in these recent years they wanted to have numbers to people that knows me and wanted to speak to my mom who they knew I had not lived with for years. And wanted to see if their view of me matched my own. 

Like I get it because it gives a clearer picture of your issue IF you actually shared it with the people they wanted to talk to.   
I live alone and how would anyone ever know if I don't share that part of myself? I also think it's weird my doctor calling people basically being like ""do you think she has bipolar disorder?"" to people who are not mental health professionals and that don't live with me and when they say no she's like hmm very interesting.

When I was diagnosed at 13 the diagnosis was 100% based on other peoples view of me because I was not there and I've always felt they put way to much weight on what other people say.

127,"This planet is odd, really. Humans can do everything, but they never have time to do it, so what's the point? If we want to do something why don't do it? 

Slipping into the world of imagination, when reality is too hard. Some of us don't want to come back and I'm one of them. I wanna stay like this forever, run away, dissapear, die... 

We're stuck in an endless loop of living, day by day, sometimes with a reason, sometimes without. I don't really understand it. It's too complicated for me to comprehend and yet, I'm still here. A long time ago I established some strong barriers, when I was really scared and lonely and oddly enough, they're the only thing that holds me here so strongly. 

Sometimes I feel like empty void and I ask myself ""Is this how death feels?"", It isn't bad, good neither.

I might day in a second, writing this or after living long life, I don't know. I just think that it wouldn't be that bad.

I want to die, but something is stopping me. Whenever I'm on the edge and I feel like doing it, I just can't. I don't know why. Maybe I'm scared of pain? Maybe it's the thought of what would happen if it wouldn't kill me? Or maybe I wanna live? The last is the least true.

In this world we aren't born equal, everyone learns it from the very young age. One is born in full of love family and the other is left with nothing, without anyone to care about him.

I sometimes ask myself ""Where's my courage?"", but I never know the answer.

Sometimes I get myself to eat healthy and work, but the other days I just stay in bed, without any intention of doing anything.

""Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans."" as John Lennon said. 

Could it also refer to bring busy imagining the better future? As you're not working towards it. Maybe you don't have enough strength to do so, or you don't want to take any risks, I don't know.

I don't think that dying is so bad. When you think you've done enough here and don't have anything more to accomplish or you just aren't able to comprehend the pressure of living, you should be able to leave. Leave forever.

Leave everything behind, go forward.

Working towards bright future is odd, when all you want to do is leave this planet. You just think about everything being pointless in the end, but if everyone would think the same, you wouldn't be there.

I like to think that there's nothing to loose, so do what you want. Others don't think like me and I can't fight them all, so I have to listen to them. No thoughts, head empty, listen to them and do what they want.

The life isn't about bright future, it's about the present. No matter what happened or what will happen, you will still be you.

Sometimes, the past will hold you back, or it's the present that hurts, does it mean that your future won't come? No, it means that you have to fight for it. 

It's hard to fight alone and I know it personally. Be kind to yourself and tell your friends that you love them, before all the hope is lost.

I don't want to be alone. I need a friend that I can talk to about everything, but 'everything' is holding me from doing it. Secrets are meant to stay secret.

I want to die. If I would die today, I would die happy, seriously. But I don't have enough power.

I know that tomorrow may bring me the power to be happy, but waiting is unbearable, especially when you've been waiting for so long.

Anyways I grew up not looking the best, and started to eat a lot to cope with the loneliness because I didn’t really have friends and my family forgets about me all the time.

Fast forward to freshman year, after many attempts, I finally start dating this girl, she was the most caring and understanding girl I’ll probably ever meet, even lost my virginity to her, and she loved me the way I was. A year into the relationship she tells me she has Huntington’s disease, a irreversible, incurable disease that’ll degrades her nervous system. I was heartbroken, the one person that truely loves me is cursed with this horrible disease. 

She hid it for me for a couple months before this scared that I’ll leave her, but no way in hell was I leaving her, loved her even more. Another 6 months passes and she needs to go off to college. She decides to break up, and I’m in no position to ask her to stay, so we end it. And this really messed me up, and I never really let her know.

I started binge eating, grades started slipping, life kinda just fell apart, started crying ever night. One day I finally had enough and manned up and asked my parents to see a psychiatrist, and they said “if you lost some weight you’ll be happy again, stop being fat”

I haven't taken a shower in days, haven't cleaned my house, haven't cooked (ordering out), have barely done any school work. I wake up after 10 hours of sleep still exhausted. I just skipped an exam so I can sleep. It won't affect my grade in the long run, but I didn't know the material anyway, which will start to affect my grade.

I do have bipolar and my meds were recently switched because of weight gain. I was on Lamictal and Invega (among others). Those have been discontinued for Tegretol.

I'm not sad or suicidal; I'm just effectively useless right now. I am seeing a therapist.

But it’s so hard to play with him. It’s so boring. I try to engage and play tug of war or fetch but i just… don’t care. I love this dog with my whole heart but i just don’t want to play or walk. It takes so much fucking energy.

142,I moved to a new city in the same state as my home city for a job opportunity (first career job) and I'm thinking about going somewhere totally new. I'm having a hard time being happy here partially because I was in an abusive relationship when I moved and because I don't entirely fit in here. I'm trying to have more creative outlets and start a band but I just feel sad frequently. Originally I was going to try to start a relationship with someone I knew that moved far away but it didn't work out so that's got me a little upset as well. I have a potential job opportunity on the other side of the country and it could be lucrative. Should I take it or am I just running away from my problems?,16Feb2020,1

144,"I have recently had nightmares. Weekly pretty much. When I was 12, I had a time period where I had nightmares often like this. But eventually they went away. Why? I don't know. I have depression and anxiety and I'm wondering what I could do to help myself get a better sleep until hopefully this goes away. I've already been on depression medicine before but I find that my depression is just worse in the winter. I can't go outside because of the snow. I'm about to be going through some big changes in the sense that I am going to get my license and start schooling for my future job as a 20 yr old. I also just escaped from a toxic relationship last may. I feel as if this is why I am having my nightmares, I don't know. I also wake up in the middle of the night often every week or so. Does anyone have more info about constant nightmares like this? Is it insomnia to keep waking up so early? How do you deal with this? I think I need to start drinking chamomile tea and honey before bed. I also rarely drink caffeine, (I used to drink it constantly but stopped because of dehydration issues) but I have somewhat frequently this week. Could that have anything to do with this? (It doesn't explain my nightmares when I don't have caffeine though)

This might sound like so many questions and some people might think this is the wrong place for this but I thought I'd ask here since my mental health could be causing this. I just wanna know if anyone has dealt with this and found their mental health has caused them. Especially since my first sign of depression was when I was 12 yrs old aka my first year of nightmares constantly. Thanks to whoever reads and comments.",16Feb2020,1
145,"31F struggling with mood swings, tendency to be overtly sensitive and bitter and just plain sad with out reason. I think it is too much to ask another person to live with someone like me, especially if they are the kind of people who prefer the company of people who are light hearted, fun loving and just able to laugh and smile. All of my partner's friends etc are exactly that kind of people. Maybe in the initial years of the relationship I was like that too but stuff has happened and I feel increasingly struggling with spells of sadness and just feeling dark. The pressure of making sure I do not pull him into this dark hole worsens my situation many times over. I feel guilty of ruining someone's life, while at this moment they could be with someone who had a happier take towards every day things. I feel the same about most of my friends who clearly have started avoiding me because of how sad I am all the time, and my partner is stuck with me and can leave coz we are married. We have fights often and he has told me that I sometimes make him sad and he doesn't want to be sad any more and wants to live a normal life.

148,"I believe that my brother may have Antisocial Personality Disorder. He is 23.

That is a bold statement, Ik. That is an often misunderstood diagnosis, Ik. Whether or not the terminology is correct, I believe that my brother is spirally downward rapidly.

I could tell you many stories of how he's exhibited antisocial tendencies. Lack of conscience/remorse, impulsive behavior, manipulation and deceit, superiority complex. They all fit. But I always chalked it up to him being a ""jerk"". My family as a whole has never considered his behavior a serious issue, they just call it ""immaturity"". Something happened today that makes me believe this is a much deeper issue.

(Sidenote: I must admit, in the past he's hurt me and a label like this would be an attempt to protect my own insecurities. This post has nothing like that attached to it. No anger. No resentment. No sorrow, or jealously. This post is coming from a place of deep concern and fear and any thoughts are deeply appreciated.)

I came from out of town to visit him. We were traveling by foot in a busy part of the city. Something had taken over him and he had been walking down the sidewalk with his hands up on his hips, his chest pushed out, and accentuating every solid, confident step he took. It was like a caricature of a confident person. That was strange in itself, but then we reached an intersection, where both sides were stopped and waiting to cross. It's a busy area so there's many people across the way come across. When the light changes, he moves forward in the same self-assured way as before. And as the opposite group moves towards him, he walks straight through them. No adjustment in speed, or direction. He walks straight into a crowd of crossing pedestrians. Hitting some, knocking others off balance. Looks of confusion and anger. Their faces saying, *what was that for?????* Myself thinking the same thing.

I grab him and say “What are you doing!?”

He replies, “I'm crossing the street, it’s not my fault they didn’t move.”

""W..what??"" I say, still piecing together the situation in my head.

""It's the city, you move out the way or get hit.""

I tell him, ""don't you realize how extremely rude that is?""

""I don't care."" he replies.

Not a speck of remorse on his face.

No justification attempted.

The conversation ends there, and he sees something he likes and begins to tell me how he wants to buy one for himself.

\~

My brother has done decently terrible things in the past. But they always ""made sense"" or were explicable in his own seriously convoluted way. He stole that money because he deserves the money more than that person, for xyz reason. He made up that devastating story about so-and-so because an action they did *could have* meant this, which resulted in that, and they need to be punished.

But these things were always ""minor"", for lack of a better word. Involving a parent or sibling. Contained within the environment of our immediate family. And as I mentioned before, explainable from his perspective whether I agreed with him or not. 

This act had absolutely no justifiable reason behind it. No matter how twisted. And these were strangers. It may sound like a small act, bumping into someone. But it shook me deeply to witness it and I can't stop thinking about it. I felt very scared in the moment, for I felt there were some very severe implications in this seemingly small act.

What is the difference between “walks straight into a crowd, does not slow down” and “drives straight into a crowd, does not slow down”. Same thoughts, different setting.

\~

Combined with this, my brother has developed an increasingly destructive lifestyle. Which is evidently getting worse, from the four days I spent with him. There's a lot to unpack, but workaholism, alcoholism, and unstable relationships have been part of his life for awhile now, and are not slowing down. However, he is also highly successful and in a way has been rewarded for the extreme nature of his personality.

I am extremely concerned for him. And I can't stop thinking about what happened today. I can imagine many different outcomes to his increasingly detrimental behavior and none of them are good. Drug overdose. Drunken accident. Suicide. I could see a twisted fate in which he hurts someone, or is hurt himself and I am scared for him.

I feel like I should talk to my parents, however I'm not sure how to do so without initiating the standard string of events would be: talk to them, they scold him, he gets upset with me, and no progress is made. 

What should I do?",16Feb2020,1

153,"I’ve never been officially diagnosed with either, so that’s why I’m referring to the symptoms and not the actual disorders. I don’t want to necessarily self diagnose myself but I do have symptoms of both. 

I live in a rural town with no resources, I have little money and no insurance. As a result, I do not have a way to see a professional. I’ve looked into all of my options, and basically there are none. But I’m at a point where I need to do something because I’ve gotten to a very rough point in my life. 

Some background: I’m currently 19 and female. When I was young I was part of the “gifted and talented” crowd. Had good grades because my parents made sure I always did my work and studied. Once I got old enough to not have their constant supervision (about 6th grade, age 11) is when I started struggling though. I’d constantly forget to do my homework or just not do it because I didn’t want to and it was boring. I made it through high school with a decent gpa because my easy classes kept it up and my hard classes were weighted, so if I was making Cs it would go on my GPA as Bs. I did super well on ACT and SAT testing without much studying, mostly because I felt like it was a competition I had to win. Like getting better scores than other people or whatever. Because of test my scores, dad’s military benefits, and financial aid due to low income, I got what added up to a free ride to a decent state school. That was a year and a half ago. 

I got to college and all motivation and I had left me. At first I wasn’t depressed too much, but I was lonely and didn’t make friends and my classes were hard. I dropped half of them and ended up sleeping with strangers on the internet to fill my desire for attention. Around the end of the first semester I went to the free school therapist and he told me there were other people doing way worse than me and he didn’t think I needed to be there. Granted, I didn’t tell him all of my problems because I wasn’t exactly comfortable, but he was right that I was managing to bullshit my way through the semester with a 3.0 gpa. However, the next semester went even worse and I actually failed a couple classes. I was having an emotionally draining “relationship” with a way older man who was giving me lots of money, alcohol, and adderall that I was abusing. All of that ended and I moved home for the summer to work and see my old friends. That was relatively uneventful. But I did start a FWB type relationship with a guy I went to high school with, which is sort of currently still going on but more about that later. 

So I went back to college last August and got a great job and things were okay until they weren’t. My best and only friend dropped out and moved far away and I was living by myself and super alone. I stopped going to class at all and the only thing I did was go to work and stay in bed all day. I failed or dropped out of every single class I took and ended the semester with a 1.7 gpa. At this point I’ve lost all my financial aid and scholarships, and currently owe $9k to my college and can’t reenroll until I pay it off. 

I moved back home and returned to my job and living with my parents like I had over the summer. It felt like rock bottom. I loved my job at school and had to give it up. Then, things got even worse and I found out I was pregnant from the guy I went to high school with. I had to tell him and he had to take me to a city two hours away over a course of three trips in order to have an abortion. The actual pregnancy and abortion didn’t affect me emotionally but his lack of concern and caring for me made me even more depressed. I should also mention that we’ve both confessed feelings before but never actually started a real relationship. Now that the abortion is over I still constantly think about him but I don’t want to.

I also did not have any insurance or anything and had to max out my credit cards for the abortion. Currently 2k in credit card debt on top of the 9k I owe to the school. Basically I feel like I’m drowning and can’t find a way out. I feel so alone and sad all the time. I can’t find the motivation to start self learning math so I can go back to school. I don’t do anything but sleep and work once again. I need to find a way to manage this but I don’t know where to start.

Well, yesterday at work something happened. I work at a popular coffee shop. I usually don’t work saturdays but I picked up the shift to earn a little extra money. I walked up to the register to help someone and it was my ex. He had no idea I worked there and I couldn’t see who was at the register until I actually walked up to it, so it wasn’t like I knew he was there. I ran to the back of the store to the employee break room and just had a break down. One employee saw and ran to get my manager.

Now don't get me wrong I would love to have a gf or bf but it is not that easy. I see everyone in my life getting a boyfriend getting into a serious relationship with them. Or at least them all having been on dates. I have not a lot of experience in that.

Guys tend to either completely ignore me or see me as a sex toy. It hurts but for now it has been the truth and well most girls I meet are straight which isn't that surprising.

I don't go out at all. I'm only at school, my tutor and on weekends I have a job. Even if I would go out into town into a bar or club I'd be so uncomfortable there. I don't want to go alone and none of my friends have the time to meet with me. Maybe they don't even want to.

I also don't want to get a dating app. I don't want to be that desperate.

I don't know what to do. I would like to be in a relationship. My mom probably thinks that if I don't get a bf before I turn twenty I drop dead into a grave and I feel like I'm so unlovable and boring that no one wants me.

My past doesn't make it better. All of my male relatives were huge assholes and left me with deep trauma or pain. I don't want to dive deep into it but let's just say I'm afraid to end up like my mom.

The pressure on me getting a bf is so fucking high that when I'm around guys I immediately think I have to impress them so that they fall in love with me. I honestly at this point dont even know if I'm doing that for myself or for my mom.

I'm just tired of being so alone. I want someone that I can share a deep connection with but I guess I'll never have that. And yes I'm aware that I'm ""only 19"" but I'm a 100% sure that I'll have the same situation with 26. 

I know I'm young and I don't need to rush things but my family makes me feel like a freak for not ever being in a relationship that I just feel bad.

I really don't know how to overcome my trauma, the pressure from the inside and my familys pressure.

TLDR: I am single since day one, I have unresolved traumas and issues that keep me away from having healthy ideas of relationships, my family especially my mom make me feel like a freak because I have been single my entire life, all of my friends have a bf, I have low self esteem and I don't have the time and courage to go outside and meet new people.

That sound system encompasses everything about me and my passion for my work and what I've dedicated my life to.

I got better to do a few things more often than before like reading. It´s not really helping with ""new"" habits that I normally wouldn´t do. I struggled with a lot of perfectionism for like the last five years since im 17 and started to get to work. This all or nothing mentality. And everytime I wasn´t able to do it perfect I gave up and wasn´t trying until I start all over to do it perfect. That really got me in a lot of bad habits. I became a really messy person and never make any progress with hobbys and stuff like that. I know that I feel good if a do sports or pratice guitar but i struggle so much to do it even slight regular like twice in a month. Because when I go home after work the first thing I do is start the TV. I don´t even watch it, I feel like I need something in the background so I don´t get into bad thoughts. While the Tv is in background I´m on the laptop on the same time. Scrolling total aimless through the Internet.

Or I can spend my time with hours of daydreaming. Its kind a obsession for me.I´m having a complete set of characters in my mind, its like book characters in my [mind.Th](https://mind.Th) story can change from one hour or day completly, sometime I go back to a story I had before. The characters itself stay the same, I got a few more than years ago and I often change their backstory. If I watch movies or anything character based like books or tv series it has huge influence about this daydreaming. I often hate if, because it changes my characters or the story.It often get intense when i listen to music, so I listen to it all the time. Even if I just go downstairs to get something for like 2min. But I don´t need to listen to music to get there. So if I go to work and kind of have to interrupt it ´s really horrible and I need some time to get into work. If its not a busy day at work and i´m not 100% concentrated at something I have these thought. Even if I talk to a costumer its sometimes only for one sentence in my mind of that world until then I go back to reallity. Its like my life is in the way for these thoughts. I´m kind of a sensitive person that always repress my bad feelings until they got back out of nowhere.  And don´t get me wrong I thing its really helpful for my life in general. So I rather life in that daydreaming then thinking about personal bad stuff. So I don´t want to get rid of it complete, but I feel like I don´t have any control over it. Is that normal or from why is it happening?  I don´t think that it´s healthy and I don´t remember when it started but like a long time ago. I´m 22 now. I had a time when I tried to write it down, the characters and the story but I gave up after a few days because it was so chaotic. I was like 16 back then and so I know that those characters changed since then. But they in general didn´t change in the past years. 

 So when I look back at what I did in my freetime or on the weekend it was totally unproductive and I didn´t really do anything. It´s really embarrassing and its horrible for my mental health that is already really messy. I moved to my first own apartment two months ago so I thought it would help me to start all over, out of the environment before. But I now see that I always go back to bad habits. Like 90% of the stuff I do is the bad habits. I made little changes like doing laundry regular and stuff like that. But I already see my apartment get more chaotic every day and sometimes I can get myself to do little talks, but I really need to force myself and its not enough.Thought about placing Notes as a physical reminder so I read them everyday but im really insecure what is helping. Kind of weird to ask but I really need help with the situation I´m in and I feel like I lose control over my life. 

Sorry for all the mistakes, english isn´t my first language. So I just want to ask for any advise that can help me.",16Feb2020,1

But so my job is constantly stressing me out because I dont know when I'm going to work or who I'm going to have to cover because they are sick.

She claimed that we never go out that she doesnt mind staying in but that we do it to much but by the time I get off work its 11 30 at night and I'm exhausted both physically and emotionally from just dealing with rude and just mean customers which come in almost every day 

It just makes me feel bad because I want to spend time with her but I work constantly and I cant just call off I'm one of the main closers

On October 27th 2019 I drank too much and got alcohol poisoning, which lead to me throwing up the next 3 days and became low on magnesium so I had a night seizure (probably another grand mal) and fell off my bed into my shoulder which pops out and in at certain angles and it huuuuuuuurts. After the alcohol poisoning, it was Halloween when I felt okay again, but I didn't just feel okay... The brain fog was completely cured and I felt my emotions so vividly I could've sobbed at anything. While I was recovering I didn't smoke about weed, and the brain fog was gone.

184,"I don't want this to sound narcissistic in any way I don't think I'm a narcissistic person, or at least I don't want to be.

Sometimes a thought occurs to me, leaving a lasting impression on me for the following days. I question whether I am the only person that actually exists.

It feels as if everyone else is fake. I'm the only person that exists in this world, nothing is worthwhile and everybody is following this system. Maybe it's because I'm good at noticing when people are lying; too good I suppose. Everybody ends up lying, usually to protect them from the social isolation that comes with authenticity. Maybe it's just because of my age, I'm in my teens, I guess people are like that. But this lack of originality and truth in people's behaviour really isn't helping my mental state.

Maybe it's because I'm so painfully average. Everything in my life is so-- average: My grades, my appearance, my home, my family. I'm not incredibly poor and I'm not wealthy either. It feels like a test; 'how well can you cope under these situations?'. Last year was awful for me and my family. Our house got flooded, during the repairs it got contaminated with asbestos, we lived in a hotel for months, went on holiday and got our passports stolen, my mum lost her dad - my grandad.

It feels like no one else can understand, of course they could - if they tried. I'm sure people will, but at least people my age don't. I don't want to sound like one of those kids that intentionally doesn't fit in but I just hate it.

It's gotten to the point where I'm just drifting through life. I've got no motivation. I'm on autopilot. My memory is getting worse. Everything feels hazy, especially school. I'm becoming more and more withdrawn, from people and my family. I hate opening up, I hate that I'm typing this. I'll probably end up deleting this or something later on. I don't care about school anymore. I want to like having friends; I want my friends to like me. I miss the past so much and I fear the future. I'm not existing myself, not like I used to.

185,"For almost a month now I've had increased anxiety and paranoia. At times it's all consuming and seriously affects my mood to the point I get angry/upset or annoyed at trivial things for extended periods of time. 

As a result of previous circumstances I already have decreased self-confidence and self-esteem. I find it hard to trust people and don't think myself to be a priority to others. My issues are by no means as bad as they could be but recently it is affecting me more than usual.

187,"My father has been emotionally and when my parents were still together physically abusive to me (I’m now 16M) due to me being his youngest child. He is not only a drug addict and alcoholic who chose those over his 5 children, but is also a compulsive liar. In the 3 years and 3 months it has been since my parents split up he has lied and claimed to: 
-Have cancer
-Have Parkinson’s
-Have Emphysema(did not have at the time but now does)
-Been sober for months yet called me drunk every day the week before.

In the past 4 months he has spent 3 weeks in hospital, each time due to either drinking himself stupid, nearly overdosing or not using his nebuliser properly and claiming he can’t breathe - all of which he blames on me. I’ve suffered from mental health issues for a long time because of it and truly believe it is my fault because of that.

Last week alone; he was in hospital due to not being able to operate his nebuliser and when I went to see him at my brothers request, his only response was ‘Oh great, the autistic one’ which greatly boosted my mental state over that condition as I’m sure you can tell.

And a few months back, in October, he tried to murder me by burning down the flat he and I were staying in whilst I was asleep. But due to him having passed out from alcohol after, he got a slap on the wrist.

Those are just a few things he’s done that affect me... can anyone give some tips on how to put this behind me? Thank you",16Feb2020,1

189,"I have no idea what to do. If anyone could pm me I’d really appreciate it. 

I’m fully aware that many of the things I’ve come to believe would be considered delusional by many people. It’s complicated and this is a very short explanation, but I think certain people are reading my mind, that my thoughts are causing awful things to happen, and that I’m being poisoned. I don’t expect any of this to change soon, and I’m powerless. I wish I had someone to talk to.

When I’m alone, and don’t have anything to distract me, I’m incredibly anxious, scared, guilty, and angry. And yet I have perfected wearing a mask of normalcy. On the outside, I look like I’m happy and thriving. I’ve recently been accepted to my dream university, too. The only change is that my grades have slightly dropped. Oddly, I don’t expect this to change- I have a lot of trouble sharing even the most extreme emotions to other people due to issues from my childhood. 

Partly, scared of telling someone about this because I’ll worry they’ll think I’m crazy and my life will irreversibly fall apart. And if the people around me didn’t think I was crazy, they’d hate me, because I’ve hurt many people with my thoughts, and my life would be over. 

Yet I’m also terrified that if I talk to someone, they will think I’m faking symptoms of mental illness for attention. That they’ll figure acting “normal” while having such frightening experiences would literally be impossible.

So the only way I can tell someone about these things and have them not think I’m a terrible person is to consciously make myself look irrational and crazy. I obviously don’t want to appear as though I’ve lost it. Furthermore, by purposefully exaggerating how I feel and making myself seem less functional than I really am, I would actually BE faking symptoms of mental illness. 

All I know is that I absolutely can’t keep living like I am now, bottling everything up. I’m miserable. I have lived like this for nearly 5 months.",16Feb2020,1
