I play a lot of video games and read a lot. Introvert, basically. Despite all these things going good for me, I feel empty. During winters I feel suicidal.

5,"Hey there, wasn't sure if I should post this here or on the medical sub, but here sounds good. So in my head it can get super hard to think sometimes, that once would have been easy, I used to have a great memory, and its still pretty good for some things, like when I want to remember a physical activity, but for like names, and let's say I put something down, I can't remember, I've been going to some hobby places of mine for months and I barely know anyone's name, like it just feels weird for me, and I even somehow forgot about tom hollonds name(lol), all that would pop up was 'Mr spider man' and zendaya cause I have very recently watched videos with her in thwm, and also time feels pretty weird to me, like a day ago could feel like ages ago, yet something that happened in my childhood I could probably remember pretty well, and it doesn't feel that long ago, and tbh I don't even really remember the average day unless there is something pretty eventful, like for a second I thought I couldn't even remember yesterday, but this week has been a bit more memorable cause I was feeling sick and I never feel sick ever. I think a might have a bit of dissociation maybe, its not that bad, but like I went on a train ride for a bit, and I put on my headphones and time just sped by pretty fast I think, idk, I was reading some other posts and I read brain fog, which, but idk, like I am kinda depressed, its up and down, but I don't think it fits, I think I kinda just faze out of reality, which makes me think dissociation, although try to think for yourselves, I don't want you to be biased by me, it might be brain fog, idk, but anyway, thanks in advance for your replies !",10Feb2020,1
6,"Just a reminder to everyone that you are worth it. No matter what you are going through, there are people that care, people that value you, people that will do anything to make you happy. You might not be able to see or process that right now - but out there somewhere there are people who care very deeply about you. You just have to find them. It's different for everyone, but from my experience, I channelled into creative processes and managed to find the right people to talk to and take my mind off things. They tried to convince me to go and get professional help - which is totally acceptable to do, but I felt as if I would be better off without it. We all go through these experiences at some point and to certain levels throughout our lives - it shouldn't be seen as something out of the ordinary.   


If anyone is feeling like they are reaching a tipping point please reach out, there are anonymous lines to call or online chats that are available for anyone to talk to 24/7. Please, don't give up. You are worth it. &lt;3  


Here is a link to some global suicide hotlines that are available 24/7. If your country is not on there, a google search of ""Local Suicide Hotline"" should come up with the number to call - if not call one from another country with the same language as your own. If that is not possible, feel free to message me or any loved ones - it is not something to be ashamed of, and they will be there for you when you need it. Stay strong everyone. You are worth it &lt;3

I feel sad. I don't have any place in the world. I don't like myself. I hate me. I don't like the way i look. I don't have any motivation to change, or to do anything. I think about killing myself or harming myself but i wouldn't do it. I feel like there is nothing to look forward to.   


When i go outside, i feel like people are staring at me and thinking bad things about me. People make me feel like everything is my fault. Or like i am a bad person  


I just feel stuck. I don't know how to explain it. And the night they came, i just felt so nervous. I just cried. I know i'm not going to be able to do it, and i'm sorry. What happens if i can't go in straight away? Then they won't help. I can't do it straight away. So what's the point? I know i won't be able to do it. Or talk.

8,"Not really sure what is wrong with me. I always seem to have anxiety one way or another, this is especially strong when having to do social tasks set out by other people but not when I do the tasks that I set out myself.

So for example, if I have to call someone for something serious on my behalf I feel no anxiety at all. But if I have to call someone for another person's behalf (ie for work or for one of my relatives) I get really anxious. This is pretty much for anything that requires social interaction in some way. If I do it for myself I can do it without feeling anything but if I do it for someone else I feel such a dread. Tomorrow I have to make a phone call for someone and I'm already feeling super anxious and cannot stop thinking about it.",10Feb2020,1
9,"I don’t know where to begin.  


My mom abused me pretty bad growing up, I was the youngest kid and really got the least attention contrary to popular belief.  My dad cheated on my mom lots, lots of fighting.  My dad left, my mom drank.  Bad divorce.  I was alone in high school.  My girlfriend since like 5th grade-9th left me which in retrospect who cares but at the time I’m sure contributed.  That was up until 9th grade.

I went to a new school, fit in pretty well but went back to the old one because of commute.  Messed up and got caught selling weed my first week.  My bad for sure I own that till I die.  I try to have more guilt than shame around it.  I was young and so fucking stupid but it’s still no excuse.  As a result I was a product of a cancel culture in the area I lived in.  I was an outcast.  

My parents sent me to programs all over the country (I don’t think they could deal with a depressed son on their own) from then until I graduated high school.  I never felt I fit in anywhere, I was exposed to a lot of really messed up things.  I saw someone try and hang themselves.  I tried to hang myself.  I saw someone cut their wrists the river way not the side way.  I saw people overdose.  I was apart of many fights.  It was a different world.

I had a tough time transitioning and dealt with a drug abuse of Xanax once I was alone in my dorm room freshman year on a Friday and Saturday for the 6th week in a row.  I was a wreck.  In Miami alone on weekends.  Nobody wanted to be with me, everyone I asked to hang out with were busy.   I kicked that habit after. Same story at the next big university I went to too.  All my old friends never wanted to be apart of me, they used to act like they didn’t know me in the gym when we had hung out that weekend.  My best friend also died of a heroine overdose.  I have never done drugs like that he was unique in that sense.  That tore me to fucking pieces like nothing I can describe.  

My friend dying took a piece of my soul.  It took my peace, it took my happiness.  He wouldn’t want that but I don’t know what to do.  

I am 22 220 rock solid lbs, I am 6’ tall, I consider myself at least decent looking but I can’t pick up a girl anymore like I used to when I was younger. I’ve just been alone.  My friends have sucked me dry of any cash potential or opportunities they could from me, nobody wants to hear me talk.  

I haven’t gone out with friends in 4 months and haven’t been consistently out in 4 years.

I used to be popular and someone who people wanted to be around.

I wish I could’ve always been with minimal friends, it would hurt less than all my friends giving up on me.  They don’t want to hear my sorrow.  

I just got diagnosed with a stomach disease called Barrett Esophagus not sure as far how progressed it is, I am a line cook so this complicates things with work.

I used to have dreams, I used to say I wanted to be a stock broker on Wall Street with a rolls Royce, I was a jock, I wanted to be a baseball player, at least in college.  

I have achieved nothing that I dreamed of and my times running out for real now.  I am a consistent disappointment to myself and the people around me.  

I have really always dreamed of being the kid that was the kid that people wanted to be with, genuine happy.  Instead I got friends that said that “life is a dark place, you’ll get other friends” when I asked why they stopped talking to me.  

I can get so angry thinking about it that I punch my wooden dresser until my knuckles bleed and I’m crying.  I hate this life that I’ve lived so much.  I’ve done nothing and nobody wants to care or help or even sit down and just have a conversation with me.  It sucks.",10Feb2020,1
10,"firstly i know I should probably get some real therapy for my struggles, I am going to but just deciding whether to try and afford something private or try my university counselling services

Anyways, im a 22 year old guy from the UK, i live in a pretty expensive city and in my 2nd year at university. Fair to say i have a lot going on, working weekends at a restaurant and studying monday through friday. i’ve been with my girlfriend for about a year and she is great.

Since i was 16 i’ve had a few struggles with my mental state. I’m not suicidal, i don’t have depression and i’m very grateful that i am relatively okay in that regard.
I have the disorder trichotillomania giving me pretty big bald spots across my head from hair pulling when stressed or anxious. When i was younger it got bad around the time of a big exam or around my parents divorcing etc but nowadays it’s daily. I also tend to isolate myself pretty bad. I know its pretty common to hide in your room or avoid social situations when you feel stressed / anxious but its getting to the point where i can’t speak to my own girlfriend for like an entire day or two pretty much weekly, I have to be completely on my own, not just physically but i also cant even answer any calls or look at the messages she has sent. Its never been this bad, and it’s hurting her bad bc it seems like i’m ignoring her and don’t care... I can see where she’s coming from, it’s pretty weird for her to explain to her friends that her boyfriend hasn’t called or messaged her for a couple days every week. 

I think my trich shows i struggle dealing with stress and this is another way it comes out, i just hope it doesnt stay as i know this one can’t last or she’ll have no choice but to end things
I’m not really asking for a set solution, i hope counselling will help me soon.. just hoped maybe others have experienced something similar or have anything they can relate with and that i’m not the only one",10Feb2020,1

I reduced my antidepressant (175mg zoloft) by 25mg 2 weeks ago and some sexuality has returned. But I think it's the anti-psychotic (3mg respiridone) that is dulling me. I see my Dr for the first time in 2 months tomorrow. What should I say? ""Hey Doc I have a limp dick and I want my emotions back a bit!?"".

I manipulate everyone in my life. I used to be way worse as a child basically manipulating everyone in my life and all the teachers at school. I never had trouble making friends because I would act differently based on who I talked to. I tried to stop this when I was about 17 and quickly realized how hard it is not to manipulate people. I often lie/manipulate for no reason other than to see how believable I can be. This was the first red flag when I found it I can't stop myself from lying and using people.

What really started me thinking was when I was watching this video on anger and violent criminals I realized how stereotype some of my behaviors as a child where.

* I harmed animals and killed birds for fun
* I started fires all the time and really enjoyed Arson 
* I had a lot of sexual frustration growing up, after being molested by a cousin when I was 6 I went and tried it on my sister....twice.

Now all I needed to check was my emotions like empathy and yes, It's really really low. But I do feel sad and lonely, I do miss friends even if I used and exploited them all my teenage years. I'm 20 now and feel like I have zero identity. Like I don't even exist outside of the person I pretend to be for whatever gain I'm going for.",10Feb2020,1

21,"I have a 19 year old college freshman that is struggling with his mental health. I am going to see him tomorrow(hopefully) and could use some guidance on how best to approach the conversation.  He had some self-esteem issues through high school, but had plenty of friends through sports. His senior year was not easy with him pushing back against us, but we hoped it was just soiling the nest as they say as he got ready to leave for college.  The fall semester of college was tough with little communication from him and him not wanting us to come up for parents weekend. When he came home between semesters, he was not in good shaped mentally. He told us at that time that he almost never left his dorm room even though there were plenty of people asking him to do things.  We got him to see a therapist twice, but he said the guy was useless. He was also heavily using weed over the break.  We gave him the option of whether he wanted to go back or not, which making that decision almost completely broke him. He said he would be unhappy at home as well as school so he might as well just go back and not be a loser.   We don't know a lot about what is happening right now, but from what we do know things appear to have gotten worse here in the second semester.  He called both me and his mother separately last week to say he does not think he can stay there all semester. We said we would come up that day and he said wait till Sunday. As we were getting ready to leave today, he texted to that today would not work because he was too busy.  We did push that he see us tomorrow and will be driving out there. The year has taken a toll on both me and my wife's mental health as a minute does not pass during the day that we don't think of him, so I am trying to make sure I am in the right frame of mind for the discussion.  To date, we have taken a very passive approach, trying to let him know we are there, but letting him make all the decisions. Seeing how devastating making a decision or handling any kind of stress right now is for him, I don't know if I should have been more aggressive.  We really just don't know/understand what is happening or what we should be doing.  Any thoughts are appreciated.",10Feb2020,1

I am struggling a lot with a traumatic event (which didn't directly involve me but affected me greatly). I will not go into details about what happened, but in short, last November my ex boyfriend killed his mom.

Please bear with me as I try to share a little bit of the backstory as well as I can. This may be long-winded.
He was my cousin's best friend. I've known him for years, and had a crush on him through most of it. As anyone who knew him can attest, he was always the nicest, most caring, goodhearted person. He was so gentle and introspective. He was so kind and full of life. He was genuine, he was present, he listened. He was my best friend at one point in my life. Our relationship, when he was in a good place, was a happy one. It was a time in my life that was just so simple and easy. I was so in love with him. He was my first love and my first everything. But he was also very ill. I know many people won't be able to understand this, but I'll say it anyway - I believe he is just as much a victim in all of this as his mom. I acknowledge that it may be hard to understand that without having known him, and believe me, I've seen my fair share of horrendous, disgusting comments made about him by people who don't know a thing about him or the situation at all, so please believe when I tell you that he was truly one of the best people I ever knew. 'Tragic' doesn't even begin to describe it – this situation or his life. 
Anyway, he and I began dating in spring 2013. Our relationship didn't last very long, I broke it off in November 2013. I wasn't fully aware of his mental illness when we began seeing each other, I had heard things early on but to me he was still just this sweet, soft-spoken guy I had a crush on for years. In all honesty, I was a naïve 20-year-old and I probably just saw what I wanted to see. But it wasn't too long before it started to become apparent to me that he was sick. So I eventually ended things. 
And after our relationship ended, he would occasionally show up at my house over the next couple of years, just looking for me or leaving random gifts in my mailbox or saying concerning (though non-threatening) things to my mom, and I think it wasn't until then that I really began to realize the depth of his illness, because I believe it was during this time that it started to get really bad. Back when we were together, he seemed normal most of the time, but would occasionally say things that didn't make any sense. He thought my cousin and other friends of his were trying to hurt him, he thought people were listening on the internet, etc. He even walked to my mom's place from his house several miles away in his pajamas with pillows and blankets and wanted to stay there (two years after we broke up), which freaked me out at the time but of course I now see as a cry for help. I've learned that he would often try to ""run away"" (he was in his 20s), and his mom would hide his keys. Or if he did leave, his mom would report him missing or go to his friend's houses looking for him. I've also heard rumors that she sexually abused him, though I don't know for sure. His mom was CLEARLY mentally ill and couldn't hold a coherent conversation at all. We all believe they are/were schizophrenic (his lawyer practically confirmed that in a roundabout way when I spoke to him a couple months back). I'd be lying if I said a small part of me wasn't a little afraid of what he might be capable of, despite the fact that he didn't seem to have a violent bone in his body. I worried over the next few years that he might do something to harm himself, but I never thought it would come to this. From the bottom of my heart, I wish I could have been there for him and done more to help him. What I viewed then as unannounced, uncomfortable, and unwanted contact in the months and years following our break-up, I now see as a desperate, heartbreaking plea for help. I wasn't there for him when he needed a friend and when he really needed help, and for that I am culpable. I'll be candid and say that I handled the whole situation so poorly because I simply did not know how to deal with it, and that guilt and regret is something I carry with me every day and I know I always will.

Eventually he stopped coming around and was no longer in my life. I still thought about him often over the last few years and wondered how he was, worried about what might happen to him. The truth is, I loved him a lot at one time in my life, and he meant so much to me. Although I'm happily married now and my concern for him has nothing to do with romantic feelings, I still care about him deeply and I think I always will. He is severely mentally ill and, again, I believe what happened is just as much a tragedy for him as it is for his mother. I truly believe he didn't kill his mother, but his disease did.

When I first heard the horrific news a little over a year ago, I was in shock. I couldn't believe it happened. My heart broke for him. I felt terrible. But I almost feel like I didn't fully process it until now. I can go periods without thinking about it too much, but then other times it'll be on my mind all day every day. Within the last couple of months, it's hitting me like a ton of bricks and I feel like I can't stop thinking about him.
I recently found out that he's a psychiatric hospital, which is the best place he can be now, but I worry about what will happen to him next. The thought of him spending the rest of his life in prison behind bars (or worse) truly haunts me.
What's bothering me the most lately is this feeling that I want to be there for him in some capacity. But it's not that simple. I've thought about whether I should try to visit him someday or write a letter, but given our history and the fact that he's clearly gotten worse in the years since I last saw him, I don't know if that's what's best for him. I don't want to trigger him in any way or make him become fixated on me again. There's also the possibility that the fact that he got so much worse over the years, combined with the horrific trauma he went through, and the medication he's surely on, his mind and the person I once knew may very well be gone, and that scares and saddens me more than I can express. I feel like I'm grieving someone who is still alive, yet gone, if that makes any sense. On the other hand, he may be MORE stable now because of medication and counseling, and I try to put myself in his shoes and imagine how lonely, isolated, and confused he must be. No one has gone to visit him from what I've gathered. He must think he has no one and that everyone hates him. I can't imagine how much it might mean to him to know that people still care about him and don't think he's a monster. And having a support system is so important, right?

The whole situation is just so disturbing and heartbreaking and I have no idea what I should do or how to deal with this. It's been worse lately because my husband is away at Air Force OTS right now so I'm staying at my mom's house for a couple of months, which is where this all took place. All of the memories are flooding back and I feel like I'm living in the past. My family and husband (he is especially uncomfortable with it) think I should stop pursuing this in any way and ""move on"", but I don't know how. Or if I should. No one understands how heavily this is weighing on me. Recently, I mentioned him in front of my mom and her response was to snap ""why do you still care? Let it go."" And a couple of weeks ago I was talking to my husband and told him that someone had mentioned how I have been though a trauma and he said ""how is that a trauma for you though?"" I just feel like no one gets it, but I'm sure many of you will. 

This became much more lengthy than I meant for it to be, but if you're still reading, thank you. Also, please, please be kind and try to be understanding. I realize that this is a very unique situation and not very ""relatable"", I think I'm just really looking for support, advice, and guidance on how to navigate all of this because it is overwhelming and consuming and I feel like I'm carrying a huge burden. And I feel like I'm doing it alone.
If you have any further questions about this situation please feel free to ask, I don't mind talking about it 🖤",10Feb2020,1
23,"About three years ago, I had a bought of mass depression come to a head and left me crying my eyes out at work, and I left to go get help from urgent care.  It was propelled by my use of Chantix to try to quit smoking.  I had never had issues with depression in my 33 years of life at that point, but then I couldn’t stop thinking of ways to “accidentally” fall down stairs, or any number of scenarios that would end in my personal demise.  I got taken to a hospital and had to do the whole paper gown routine where they screen you to make sure you’re not going to off yourself after you leave.  I was given an option to do an out patient program and my job approved me doing half days so I could get help.  During that time, I was prescribed Prozac, which I never really liked or felt entirely like myself on.  The psych at the program seemed pretty indifferent and wasn’t interested in switching me to anything else.  Zoom forward three years— I came out of a bad relationship and within three months I notice that I’m actually smiling and goofing around, feeling a glimmer of my old hyper self and not understanding why then.  I made a choice to see if it lasted for longer than a few weeks, and it did.  It lasted four months.  I decided it’s time to stop the Prozac.  I weened myself off with little to no side effects other than general feelings of being off when I was extending the time between doses.  Everything went well.  I’m now still okay, but I find myself having feelings I feel like I’ve not felt as intensely even before the medication started, but they’re not suicidal ideation, just feelings of insecurity on a myriad of subjects.  I have pretty good self esteem, but I’ll find myself feeling like I shouldn’t be with anyone because I feel like I am damaged in some way and that they’ll figure it out eventually and leave.  It wasn’t always like that.  I’ve always been a very sure person that knows what I want and figures out the best way to proceed with it.  I worry that maybe I just am not used to feeling emotions without the pills the way I did before.  It’s disheartening at times because I feel like I’m having to relearn how to be and not sure if my autopilot is ever going to return to normal.  Is this normal for getting off antidepressants?  To be clear, I do feel good— I just have off times where I’m afraid to express what I am feeling because I’m unclear if it’s an appropriate reaction based on how I process my emotions right now.  I’ve been off Prozac for about two months now.",10Feb2020,1
25,"In the past month or so, I've felt much more anxious in social interactions. I have almost of the symptoms associated with a paranoid personality disorder, and I fell like I'm becoming gradually more scopophobic.

They were understanding and said that they would find someone for me to talk to. It's been quite some time since then, and I don't know what's going on. They said that they would let me know what's happening, but I haven't heard from them about this since.     
If I don't get help soon, I think it's just going to get worse and worse, but I don't know what to say. Should I just tell them what's really going on?",10Feb2020,1

And when I decide to be brave and tell them, they just judge me or dismiss me. I make different personalities based off of people I meet because I’m too insecure of who I actually am.

33,"16, male.

A couple months ago I noticed my memory is worsening. Last year, mid May, I used to like someone, apparently I talked about her with an online friend and seemed to be pretty obsessive about her.

According to this friend of mine, I also was very insecure about myself and sent various photos of myself trying to feel better, I also vent about my family and shared more details than I should have.

I don't remember any of this. I have a vague, very vague memory of telling him some of these things, and the others seem like things I'd say. And he told me about the very personal things I told him, they are all true but I don't remember telling him about this.

My memory was something I was very proud of when I was young. And recently I have noticed things changing where I lived. Trees are gone, new ones appeared, one of my cat's coloring is different than I remember it to be.

In the last couple months I had some breakdowns when I realized I was mostly alone. I sometimes would hurt myself until I realized it wasn't worth it.

I am somewhat of a loner. Spend most days without talking to anyone other than my family unless I go to school or somewhere else (I usually don't text people). I used to be a very empathetic person and trust most people, in fact, I overshared personal problems quite easily.

Currently I can't feel comfortable telling anyone I know personally (the fake anonymity makes me feel safe) about anything I am sharing in this post. I also realized I don't care about others nearly as much as before, still I still force myself to look like I care more than I do.

Other times I'd just act weird. Like exit my house at night and walk around (I live in a rural area so it's relationship safe to do so), or feel very tempted to do so.  Or just talk to myself in the 3rd person, once or twice talking imagining someone (specific or not) is listening. 

Lately I have been feeling happy during the day but I also feel doomed when alone. The later is not a recent thing. I wouldn't say I have depression too.

I also feel very pressured and paranoic when alone in a crowded place. I don't feel scared of anything specific, I just feel alert and my heart beats fast all the time.  I do not have social anxiety (I think), I don't have troubles taking in public or taking to a stranger.

34,"I started seeing a therapist recently. She was really confused as to why I have never taken an antidepressant before and recommended I get on one. As far as I can remember I've had bouts of depression (literally as a child)... I come from a really neglectful/abusive home so my parents never tried to help and a lot of my behaviors were vilified instead of treated. So this is why it's taken so long to actually try seeking help in the form of medication.

The only problem is I quit my job recently and have no health insurance. I have a part time one now. I guess I could try to get a full time job with insurance but I feel like shit and I don't know how long that'll take me. I've been feeling like utter garbage for a while now and I just want to feel better as soon as I can. I'm sick of trying to pretend I'm just being lazy or melodramatic and need to pull myself up by my bootstraps and ""get over it"". It hasn't worked in the past two decades of my life so I don't think it'll magically get better now.

I'm going to see about trying out that lemonaid website tomorrow. Is it even worth it? Will they just tell me I need to go to a doctor in real life? I really don't have the funds it could potentially cost for me to visit my primary doctor to get diagnosed and prescribed and then follow ups... on top of paying for the medication by myself. What are some resources I can seek out? Anytime I try to google stuff it's just teledoctors and I tried one who told me I need to go visit a doctor in person and that they only refill prescriptions.",10Feb2020,1

The psychiatrist prescribed me 50mg of Zoloft and a trazodone for my insomnia. I took the trazodone and it worked once but after that It failed to but me to sleep. She then me to Switched me to mirtazapine which also failed to work to which she advised me to try taking two. I took her advice and followed it up with zzzquill which made me stop breathing in my sleep. So she took my off both sleeping medicines completely and prescribed me quetiapine for both the worsening hallucinations and the insomnia. Which has been working tremendously I feel incredibly leveled headed and clear and calm but I’m having a problem as well... 

About a month from when I was first prescribed Zoloft, it  stopped working and I started to have increasingly vivid auditory and visual hallucinations . I also started to have really bad impulse control (buying things I don’t have the money for . Taking random walks. Drinking until I’m drunk) and bouts of the euphoria and excitement where I just felt on top of the world. But then when these episodes are over I feel extremely depressed and can’t find the motivation to make it through the day , I’ll also have intrusive suicidal thoughts. When she gave me the quetiapine the euphoric episodes went away but now I just feel extremely depressed and anxious. It’s like nothings working. My ptsd and ocd are back full force and I’m terrified to go to sleep at night as I’m extremely afraid of the dark and the Zoloft was helping taking the edge off of the anxiety

I know I should be telling my therapist this but there’s no way I can’t meet with her Right now because she’s booked and my college class schedule makes it incredibly hard to meet with her. I feel trapped in my own body like I’m drowning like my depression will get better and that I’ll either have to make a choice to be crazy or sad all the time , there’s no silver lining.

I've also found it difficult to connect with people at school and, though I have a few friends that are very nice when I talk to, no one has initiated a conversation with me for a long time.

I’m 24 and I believe around middle school I developed an inferiority complex. A quick google search describes it as:

Insecurity and low self-esteem.

Inability to reach your goals, or feeling “stuck”

Wanting to give up easily.

Feeling the need to withdraw in social situations.

Often feeling down on yourself.

Experiencing anxiety and depression.

I’ve been diagnosed with both anxiety and depression, but I have been able to overcome them for the most part (they come and go). The rest of the “signs” are still prevalent for me and have been for as long as I can reasonably remember. Everything in that list is how I have described myself to my therapist or just to myself throughout my life. I’ve felt “stuck” since high school and can never seem to make any meaningful progress towards goals. I just can’t seem to believe in myself and so I give up often. I feel like an imposter in everything I do. I withdraw from friends and family ALL the time and have never been able to maintain friendships because of it. I want to engage with life and just feel okay with myself but I have such a hard time... everything feels like an uphill struggle. 

I’ve tried to look at things objectively and a lot of these feelings don’t match up to reality or what people tell me about myself, but that doesn’t seem to have any effect at all on how I feel or behave.

Today my father gave me a camera to train my small brother with, told me to delete the files and factory reset so he can have as much space as possible.

This already overloaded me with guilt and a surge of cuteness but then I stumbled upon some pictures and they were of my dad playing around with small brother, like just silly poses and them taking pictures of each other and I almost had a full on breakdown because I felt like I missed out on that experience.

For context my dad used to work from morning till midnight so our interactions were already cut in half, he hanged around the house during the weekend but usually napped or caused a family fight(there was a 3 year period where the family ties were really fragile and I was around 8 or 9 when this started) and was always the judgmental type(still is). Not saying he never did right by me because he treated like an adult(I used to tell him that I don't want him to do that and I still don't want him to do that) and also gave me gifts around every birthday or two but he also had unnatural exceptions which if unfulfilled he wouldn't talk to me or outright ignore me.

I am quite new to this platform so I’m just getting used to it and how you communicate effectively. I’m trying to get a viral hit in the UK in order to improve mental health services. I’ve put together a 15 point plan of how I would do that and I’ve created a video which is pinned to the top of my Facebook page for people to watch and understand how I would change services for the better. I need to get mass public are buy-in for my plans and ideas in order to create sweeping change in mental health.

Through conscious writing and spontaneous narration; I have delivered a body of work that I Hope connects with people in a way that mental health storytelling has not done before. I hope that people are able to “put themselves in my shoes”. 

This is a new style of talking and writing about mental health in the United Kingdom because I wanted to answer the question “how do we talk about mental health? “

Well through conscious writing and spontaneous narration I hope that I am delivering on that. I am writing with my heart not my head because I wanted to reflect how it truly felt to have a mental health condition and to live with it in this country. 

I’m afraid it’s not been a very good time for me and people have treated me very badly. 

Bigotry is rife in the UK and the levels of bigotry are far higher and graver than racism today - in my opinion.

Did you know that millions of pounds are being spent on trying to stop people being bigots?That is a ridiculous waste of tax payers money and I believe that if I do get a viral hit and I get the attention of a lot of people - then I could stop lots of bigotry within the space of about 10 minutes. Because I would given no holds barred statement about what it feels like to be a victim of bigots. And hopefully I’ll be able to put the bigots “in my shoes” so that they can see it and feel it for themselves - and understand how bad it is and how bad it makes you feel. 

And if I can do that then I can hopefully convince millions of people to stop being bigots or to at least realise that they are bigots and get some help with it and educate themselves better. In my opinion the majority of the United Kingdom are mental health bigots. 

That must change. 

We have come on in leaps and bounds on so many different topics and issues - same sex marriage, combatting lots of racism etc. - within this country and yet mental health always seems to take a back seat. 

I think it’s time for us to have a proper normal adult conversation about mental health and stop avoiding the subject. At the end of the day it affects one in four of us. It’s going to affect all of us at some point in our lives whether or not we get it directly… It could be that a loved one gets it. So we need to be more understanding and more sympathetic to those that suffer with it. 

Please do take a good 15 minutes to have a look through my website and all of the content that I’ve been trying to create a viral hit with. It’s been a real labour of love to bring this website together. Because it is an amalgamation of two Facebook pages - one of which has been taken down and I’m hoping that will be reinstated because it has gone to appeal with Facebook. 

If you like me and you like my work then please do support me and follow me on this journey. There is no reason why I cannot pull this off. And I know that people are always questioning my mental health but it should not be impossible to get a viral hit in the UK on this subject. And I’m determined to do it. 

I really hope it soon though because I’m running out of time and money and I can only volunteer my time for so long. If you get this message please do have a look at my website and please do consider becoming my friend on following me on Facebook. Any suggestions that you might have about getting a viral hit - I would be so grateful to hear them. 

I am a sufferer of psychosis and on occasions I may come out with some bonkers statements. 

But I hope you can forgive this and understand that I can’t help it. 

I’m told that I will get better and I hope that I will because it’s quite annoying to have psychosis. It doesn’t happen very often. But when it does, it causes me problems sometimes. 

But on the whole I’m a very intuitive, decent, honourable, trustworthy, honest, emotionally mature and emotionally-well-developed youngish man who is just trying to make a difference in the world and is a warrior for mental health. 

❤️ Please do give me your time and help me make this viral hit - a reality! 

And become part of a group that went on to improve mental health services in the UK - something to be incredibly proud about. 

It’s time for change. Join my revolution.

Big Kiss,

Then they’ll potentially do it on that other patient when the coast is clear or clear them to get the other harder. I don’t think they always do this when necessary nor do I think they do scarcely. - If they wanted to get revenge on you they could... say.... make you wait a day and a half in the waiting room giving you all sorts of cues that you will be admitted then you you would so shook that, bam, now you will actually have anxiety/depression/bipolar/schizophrenia and in that order. Not to mention the meds they give you will fuck your brain and body up down and all around and will also shorten your lifespan just being on them. Once you’re in the system it is almost impossible to get out. They will do everything in their power to make sure they get their money. They will make sure you take your meds, go to expensive inpatient and outpatient facilities for as long as they possibly can on both accords. And, oh, don’t act out! If you won’t take the meds they will inject you with them even if you won’t take them because you know they’re dangerous and especially if you’re trying to stop all together to prolong your life. These meds have a very long half life and they never taper you off them unless when putting you on a stronger one and maybe rarely to put you on a weaker one that will leave you feeling locked in at a lower level and stupid. Of course too much of a strong medication will also make you stupid or make you look stupid because it’s hard to think on them let alone act right or act at all..... On any level.... these meds sucks.

OH AND DO NOT EAT OR DRINK THERE!!! - they put something to or another in the food, drinks, coffee; not to mention the meds for free from yours truest the same satanic nurse who gave you the dirty looks and just switched you Ativan for one of her birth control pills. Don't even fret. Don’t even trip dawg. -thing is, it’s like any drug in the world so they can read you very well on it and you yourself don’t know how it feels yet or what it even does - all so you act out again easier. They probably change the drug all the time or mix different ones together all the time as well. -this isn’t just one establishment I’ve been to 6 different ones. They all do the same things with added tricks depending on their circle. - this is probably ok’d by the government on some level somehow or they just don’t know about it yet. But it’s making more money more than half of the time at the cost of human lives. Most people would never act out even if they would by these methods and most real criminals would never fall for these tricks.

I have to call tomorrow since they had called me on Friday to connect about the interview, and I'm terrified of having to call back tomorrow. 

Its...conflicting? I applied to this job but now I'm very afraid that I've gotten it as weird as that sounds. It's like my brain doesnt want me to get it, and honestly I am hoping that I'm not offered the job/I might reject the offer. 

I dont....have any real reason to, other that I am dreading horribly to make that call tomorrow and have to decide on things like that. Plus, if I'm honest with myself, as much as I want a full time job (or maybe dont?), i worry about my ability to fully perform 40 hours a week.",10Feb2020,1
61,"OK so all through my childhood, my mom was very abusive, physically mentally emotionally and verbally. Us being from a very conservative background were not much aware of Mental health issues and solutions. This has been an ongoing process for the 28 years of my life. But now it’s come to a point where she will pick up a knife and laugh maniacally and pointed the knife right into my face. She did the same with my younger sister. How can we reach out to get help for her? We live in Toronto. Please let me know if anyone can help me in anyway. The only thing I’m worried about is we also have a 15-year-old sister. So we don’t want child servicesOr anybody getting involved that might take her away from us even though my mom has never laid a hand on her thankfully.",10Feb2020,1
62,"I don’t really know why I’m posting this. I’m in a mental health facility now. I’ve been very depressed for a long time which switched to happiness a few weeks ago. I thought I was better. I’ve never felt happiness and love for life the way I did. But the better just kept getting better and better and better until I was too far over the line and I stopped sleeping and eating and drinking because I already had so much energy. I thought I was having a manic episode. My sleep deprivation turned into hypervigilance and I went to the mental health ward as an involuntary patient with one doctor believing I was experiencing either mania or schizoaffective disorder. But after a second opinion of a doctor who thought it was complex-ptsd they agreed to switch me to involuntary which I jumped on because I just wanted to leave and I was discharged with diagnosis not yet determined. 

I wish I never went home. My symptoms didn’t leave. They got worse. I started hearing whispers. There were people in my room for minutes upon minutes that weren’t really there. I was seeing things and hearing things. And then yesterday morning apparently I leapt out of bed and was yelling “no!” At something in the corner. I don’t remember this at all. I have no Memory of it. It was my boyfriend who told me because it woke him up and apparently it was enough for my darling boyfriend to leave me over it and I’m so shattered. We were together for 4 years and I thought we were going to get married. He just completely dumped me. Helped me back my bags and sent me on my way. I love him so much and I’m so ashamed and embarrassed that I put him through anything like that. I was hiding my symptoms so well and I wish I didn’t and I wish I never left the first mental health facility. 

Well after he left me I had nowhere to go and because I already had my plans and what I needed to kill myself I decided to go back to the ward. I’m in here now. But I don’t know what to do or what’s going on. I keep telling myself to get discharged so I can go kill myself because that feels like it’ll be more helpful right now. I don’t really have anything else. I love this person so much and I can’t believe I hurt him so bad. I don’t know why I’m posting this. I guess I just feel like I’ve completely ruined my life. I don’t know why I’m in the ward. Thanks for reading.",10Feb2020,1
63,"The past couple days, the best I could describe it was being in a constant state of delusion. I though i was constantly being watched and stalked by someone I referred to as “they”. It went on for about a week and today was the first day where I felt normal again. No feeling of being watched or stalked by “they”. But I feel like less of a person, like I’ve lost part of me when I was in that state. I can barley remember this last week. I found a notebook that has some pretty scary things in them that I hardly remember at all. I lost my mind and part of it never came back. I feel like I’ve lost my purpose and am even more suicidal as a result.",10Feb2020,1
64,"My insurance does not cover my doctor that I’ve been seeing for 12 years. An appointment with him costs $300 for an hour. I definitely need to be seeing a psychiatrist but I’m having trouble paying the $300 since he wants to see me every 2 weeks.

65,"I feel confused about who I am and lack self esteem..!

I don’t really know how to explain this
Like my life is literally quite empty I don’t work or in education I don’t have any friends I struggle to leave the house let alone talk to people and even online I really struggle to make conversation with people I’m so unsure of myself and what I want to do with myself 
I just feel like a broken man whose face even shows it
Wth can I do about this?",10Feb2020,1
66,"I started out feeling a way I can't explain. I went from feeling nothing to going out with friends and feeling new. Then something happened and I was convinced I was pregnant, maybe. I never took a test, but I don't know. That slowly turned into me borderline losing my mind. I started writing in journals and now I can't even recognize what I was feeling exactly.   
I can't even explain what any of it was. That turned to be staying and joking around at my friends, not exactly sure what happened there. I wasn't happy and I felt like I was losing it but looking back I think it was better than I feel now. My mind has obviously changed and I'm growing up I guess but this doesn't feel right.  
Now I find myself dwelling on my friend from two years ago that I haven't had a real conversation with since around June I guess. It could be a year at this point. I'm also starting to realize that we may not have been friends at all and it was all in my head. All the being head over heels and thinking I loved them all like family. It all just dissolved. It's gone. My friend group, it's gone. My best friend of over three years, planned on moving in with me, I loved her, and now it feels like shes dissolved too. I'm confused as to why I'm not upset, I think shell still come back but I don't know what to do.  
Everything feels like its repeating, it feels familiar, but it also feels like I'm in another universe.   
I started to get all lovey-dovey and I gave advice. I don't understand, I'm an asshole. I knew it was coming out of my mouth and I was aware I was saying it, but I don't know why and I don't understand why I cared. I don't get it. I contemplated suicide, I thought about death a lot. I ate raw meat. I had all my friends calling me crazy and telling me I'm not mentally here. Then when that crazy was gone and I was just a husk it seemed like no one gave a fuck. I don't understand what's happening and there's some shit I'm thinking of that I don't even know how to describe. Who the fuck am I, who is this, why am I here, where am I, and why on gods green earth do I look like this?",10Feb2020,1
67,"Just recently figured reddit out, and found this sub i find the most suitable to share the post. 
 So there's a small weird occurance i didn't talk about for a while because i couldn't find words to explain, but now i kinda opened up so i wanted to know if other people also have experienced it.
 Basically, once in a while, if i focus too much on reality i end up dozing out so much that i momentarily forget about who am i and just existence in general. it lasts for about a few seconds, and it has turned into a fear. (which i kinda got over by myself recently)
 The closest explanation i've found was a post on reddit like 7 years ago and beside that, i couldn't really find anything throughout a bunch of searching on google.",10Feb2020,1
68,"My inability to let go of anger and resentment is destroying me and my relationship. I keep reading different things online to try and help me just let go of things that already happened but when forced to think about them, I just get re-angry!

I really want to let this poison go, I'm exhausted. I hope maybe a professional can help me develop better skills to deal with this ball of hate I have inside me. I also thought maybe I would join a beginners yoga/mindfulness group but I'm very hesitant...

Has yoga/meditation/mindfulness training helped anyone on here?",10Feb2020,1
69,"I'm failing one of my classes because I haven't turned in any work. Part of me is focused on yelling at myself for being stupid and lazy, part of me is saying ""GO MAKE UP THE WORK!! DO SOMETHING!!"" But won't actually do anything, and part of me is saying ""fuck it even if you tried youd fail so why try?"". Its fucked. I'm gonna be ineligible for my school choir, which is really REALLY important to me, but even with that incentive I cant get myself  to do anything?? I want to scream",10Feb2020,1
70,"Two days ago I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/f09k2q/my_so_tried_to_commit_suicide/). TLDR: my SO had tried to end her life three weeks before I posted that and I was having some trust issues with her, never been sure that she was not going to try again.

She tried yesterday. Just as I feared in the other post, I woke up and found she had taken all the medication she had prescripted at once, along with some amphetamines she somehow had bought online. She took the pills a few hours before I woke up, hoping that I would found her when it would be too late. That's what she wrote on her goodbye letter (no phone message this time, she learned from the last attempt). Luckily, that was not the case.

Once in the hospital the thing that most came to my mind was how I would not be able to go through what I had gone the last time, and now I feel extremely selfish. Her parents told me that their advice to me, if I was their son, would be to leave her. I don't want to do that, obviously, but that scene alone is heartbreaking. And yes, there were moments when I thought I should do it, because now I will not be able to trust her again. Then again, both times I found her right on time and, if I was not there, she would be dead by now. How could I walk away knowing that if she ever tries again, probably nobody would notice until it was too late? Her parents live 45 minutes away from her house and if there is a third time, she would pick a faster method. As I said, she learned from her last attempt, and she is smart and can be deceptive. More yet, the fact that I leave her will not mean I stop caring about her, and I know that if she tries again and succeeds, I will feel guilty for not being there.

I've already booked an appointment with my therapist because I don't know how to cope with this anymore. Take this post as a small vent, and I apologize if some parts don't make much sense, from a grammatical perspective.",10Feb2020,1
71,"I'm right here with you. Last semester I missed over 100 classes, and I'm only in 11th grade. This semester I want an almost-perfect attendance, and it might be one of the hardest things I'll attempt this year. Let's do it together. When you're getting ready and just feel like going back to bed or staying in, I hope you'll remember this post.

72,"I've had thoughts of suicide on and off for 10 years now. I actually tried to kill myself six years ago.

I got them under control most of last year but around new years they came back yet again.

I always feel like I'm wasting my life. I can't plan long term and I live day to day because that's all I know. I got used to it because it's really hard for me to function and I was convinced I would die very soon.

I turned 25 in November and I felt so much pressure. People commenting on my age makes me feel really self-conscious. Years ago I had a feeling that I'd lose my early 20s to mental illness just like I lost my adolescence and I turned out to be right. I don't feel like I've done anything worthwhile. When I was a teenager I couldn't wait for my life to begin because I was incredibly isolated and miserable. And I've never felt like it happened.

People have projects, ideas, dreams. I never let myself truly dream because I assumed it would only lead to disappointment. I struggle to get out of bed and I don't even function well enough to shower regularly.

I wanted to draw. I drew quite well as a young teen, but my depression completely overtook me and I barely did it since. Only here and there, very slowly, and my skills never truly improved. I used to think that by now I'd have a good skillset but I was stunted and now I have so many negative emotions associated with art that I cry and get frustrated nearly every time I try to draw or paint.

I feel worthless. I keep thinking about the person I could've become if it weren't for trauma and mental illness. Wishing I was better, wishing I had actual close friends, wishing I knew how to do the things I wanted to do. I'm obsessed with time. I'll never get the last ten years back and I'll keep drifting indefinitely, struggling to stay alive and surrounded by half-finished projects I will never finish.",10Feb2020,1
73,"I (15M) have been feeling so numb and down the last year, I lost a loved one and had no reaction to that, reunited with old friends and felt very little happiness doing that even though I care about them. I feel like I'm living my life on autopilot because I can have fun when I'm around other people and really devoured to a certain subject, however the moment when I tun my mind to myself and become introspective, I lose all feeling of emotion and catch myself staring off at meaningless things for a few minutes a time even though there is a bustling atmosphere around me. I don't really know what to do about the situation other than the obvious, which is to speak to a therapist. Please share your thoughts in the comments, especially if you have had a similar experience.

74,For the past 6 months I’ve been dealing with bouts of self harm and my anxiety disorder and possibly adhd but I can’t seem to get help.

75,"So I have decided to get some mental help and found a group of psychologists that advertise assessments within two weeks of a single session. I thought this may be absolutely perfect, but how reliable/accurate can something based on a single session be, especially regarding disorders like ADHD and autism? I know next to nothing about this (except for what google told me lol) so I´d appreciate any advice.

It's been two days, the other night after my mum screamed at me I told her she was a bad mum and a worse person for all the abuse she's made me endure. It was finally after I couldn't take her yelling anymore. She also called me ungrafteul for not putting up with her yelling because she buys thing for me but she treat me like that because I deserve to be respected. Today I tried to be nice to her but she won't even look at me and keeps ignoring me. She said to me at one point without looking up after I tried talking to her ""don't call me mum"" which hurt my feels, it feels like I'm being disowned but for what? for standing up to her? because I decided to value myself and not let her tear me down she's punishing me. I'm really upset and frustrated please help.",10Feb2020,1
78,"I work at a grocery store and recently got a promotion from a bagger/cashier to overseeing our new self-checkout area. I like my new job, though it definitely has its moments that make me wish I never accepted the promotion. I knew the general public was stupid and rude, but somehow the customers never fail to surprise me with even more stupidity and rudeness. I mean, at least twice a day I see someone touch the ""pay with card"" button and proceed to try to pay with cash. For some reason, nobody understands what the ""skip bagging"" option means. And despite the large blaring signs that read, ""NO ALCOHOL PURCHASES AT SELF-CHECKOUT"" I have to void at least a dozen transactions a day because they tried to scan alcohol. The best part is that these scenarios are often accompanied by vulgar words, mean comments, and disgusting attitudes. I've noticed one of the many special features on stupid people is that they are unable to self-reflect and accept that they're the ones making mistakes, not the machine.

All this to say, my job is okay. There are good moments and bad moments, same as my last position. It's either extremely boring with no customers, or extremely busy with a line of customers. 

I'm not sure exactly what is causing me to feel this way, but lately I've been experiencing severe anxiety before I go to work, and even the night before. When I have the early morning shift, I'll almost purposefully stay up late and get drunk, in the hopes that I won't wake up in time in the morning. Even when I wake up in time to get ready, it feels impossible to leave my bed until the very last second, because I try to be late on purpose. 

It's just the last place I want to be. I work five days a week and go to school the other two days, where I have four classes a day. Monday and Wednesday I work the closing shift, until 10pm. Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I work the opening shift, 8-4:30. It's way too much. I don't have a single day to just relax. 

As for today, people were particularly stupid. The best part is when there's an error message on the self-checkout screen, and these morons continue to ""scan"" items, even though no items will scan if there's an error message on the screen. It was just pissing me off. I also started my period today, so I'm sure that contributed to my anger. 

I don't even think I let my attitude show that much, I just didn't have my fake, happy-go-lucky customer service persona on. Sometimes I don't have the energy to fucking pretend anymore. I hate my life, I hate my job, I don't even want to be alive -- why the fuck should I smile and fake happiness? The customers couldn't care less either way. Unlike my male coworkers, I get a lecture from my boss every time I'm caught not beaming from ear-to-ear.  

Today there was a dry spell so to pass the time I was sorting through the old receipts in my pocket when suddenly the cashier lines got long. I am expected to go and badger customers, who can clearly see that we have self-checkout, and try to convince them to try self-checkout instead of waiting in line because we want to get more people to use them for whatever reason. I looked up, saw the lines, and was about to go ask them when I saw my boss asking people to go to self-checkout. 

My boss is super passive-aggressive, so of course, she gave me a few little ""looks"" in between asking customers, which is my job. She pulled me aside to give me a lecture. I was able to pull it together and fake being somewhat happy for a few hours. But when there were two hours left in my eight hour shift, I just couldn't do it anymore. I started tearing up. I still did my job and helped the customers through my tears. But in between customers I walked down a few aisles to try and get myself under control. Customers saw, my co-workers saw. 

I don't want to go to work tomorrow. I need a mental health day. Seriously, I can't take this shit anymore. It's such a toxic work environment already, with all the drama, passive-aggressive comments. I literally heard my boss telling another co-worker that she, ""doesn't like me, but she tolerates me"" when I was five feet away from her. 

I'm so broke, I just bought a new car since my old one died. I'm responsible for paying my tuition as my parents won't help. I just feel trapped and I can't do it anymore. Any of it.",10Feb2020,1
79,"might be because i have either bad bronchitis or pneumonia, but everything is just setting me off mentally, every day I almost break something because i just keep tgetting mad. Getting shit on by reddit doesn't help/",10Feb2020,1
80,"I love my job. I know some great people. I’m definitely not alone in the world. I’m making pretty good money. I’m young, (not to toot my own horn but...) handsome, I’ve got a whole life ahead of me, I live in a great country, so why the fuck am I so sad? 

 I should be happy, or at least content. I’ve got a lot going for me. Most other people in my shoes would be happy. But I don’t know what happiness feels like. I haven’t been happy in years. All I feel is pain. The only thoughts I have are bad. I’m so full of hate and I just want it to go away. This world has me beaten down. 

What do you do when you have so much going for you, and you should be content/happy, but you just can’t find it? Anxiety and depression ruin *fucking everything* for me. I don’t want to be like this anymore. I’ve tried doctors and counsellors but nothing works so I’ve given up.",10Feb2020,1

82," 

It seems like advisory committees, boards and panels are stacked with the same people.   The effects of mental ill-health on many of us affects our ability to participate in activism, affiliate or network with consumer and other peers to 'represent' their views.  How many of the most severely affected by mental ill-health will not be given a second look in peer work? The disheveled, those with strange language patterns, beliefs or motor behaviour? 

Sure, they might be 'inconvenient' relative to someone neurotypical, but would you say the same about someone with a physical disability whose problems get in the way of them expressing their views, particularly in the context of consumer advocacy?

Less 'attractive' views aren't any less valid, and our voices should be heard by non-profits, service delivery organisations or elsewhere.  I, for one, am frustrated. I want to partner with an organisation that really wants to work with me, and doesn't demand a marketable, cookie cutter story of mental ill-health?   I don't want to work with an organisation who demands a peer work 'qualification' like that certificate, a barrier to entry to peer work that again filters for 'higher functioning'. I do have a higher level of education, but on principle, the same principles behind the case I've made above, it seems absurd! The most relevant qualification, to me, is our lived experience!  Are we going to let these opportunities to continue to be given out the way they do? I get that organisations are risk averse, and want people who are 'proven' or might not 'rock the boat'. If you are a decision maker who gatekeeps voices you want to hear, you agree with already, people you know, people with a nice CV, then you're the problem.",10Feb2020,1

Don’t kill yourself today

Because your Netflix trial still has a week left

Don’t kill yourself today

Because no one else will finish off the chicken in the fridge

Don’t kill yourself today

Because I know for a fact that Starbucks is releasing a new Frappuccino sometime next month

Yes, your mother will miss you

Yes your bully will make a sappy Facebook post about how what a a wonderful person you were

And yes

Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem

You know that

You’ve known that

Everyone and anyone has been shoving that down your throat since they first learned what the word suicide meant

So don’t kill yourself

Until you finish your shampoo and conditioner at the same time

Don’t kill yourself

Until Doctor Who is finally cancelled

Don’t kill yourself

Until you tell someone your best pasta recipe 

Don’t kill yourself 

Because I will keep coming up with reasons for you not to

And I need you

To hear all of them

Don’t kill yourself

I love you

You’re important

It’s a bad day

Not a bad life

There is more to this

The world will keep spinning on its axis without you

But

Think of all the sunrises you’d miss

I know this sounds pointless

But when you’re sitting in front of everything deadly you own

Revising your goodbyes

There will be too much darkness 

To see anything else

But this is not about seeing anything else

This is about turning off the lights

This is about finding the bed instead of the noose

This is about giving yourself one more day

Even if it takes ten thousand of those

One more morning’s

Until

“I can’t wait for tomorrow”

This is about staying alive

Because there’s gonna be a new Marvel movie

No one should miss that

This is about staying alive

Because the future is coming 

And it’s ready for you

I don’ t need you to see it

I just need you to believe you can make it 

Until then",10Feb2020,1
85,"  Hello everyone. I hope you are well. I write this at my wits end and looking for any help that can be provided. I have a doctor appointment coming up this Wednesday (via phone) and a face to face one in 3 weeks.

 I have been hesitate about going to a therapist but I have allied to a few yesterday as I know I need help. I will try to make this as clear as possible as I fear this is going to come across as rambling. I \[m27\] suffer from long term pain, I have not been pain free for 10 years. The pain is 24/7 and I have forgotten what its like to be pain free. It has some what taken over my life. Started as a permeate headache, I just woke up one day and it never left. 

In the past 3 years it spread to my entire body. My doctor thinks I may have fibromyalgia, but I have not been diagnosed yet. The pain of my head and body is still 24/7. 

Stress is a large trigger for my pain. And I have had a lot of additional stress in the last few months (family dog passing away, close family passing away, my dad being made redundant, my mom not reacting well to her cancer treatment).   

I have been in an amazing relationship for 11 years. And got married late last year. 

But, either due to to the constant pain or maybe due to my medication I have been getting mood swings ( super down moments where suicide is heavy on my mind, but far less often, I have super highs where I seem unstoppable) and gaps in my memory. The memory gaps started off small a couple of years ago but they have proceeded to get worse. I am loosing half of my days at work, loosing evenings and no recollection of conversions (this has lead to me double booking events, missing events etc) and a lot of other memories have a white lens flair over it, obscuring it making it hard to look back.

 \[I have tried to keep dairies but I forget where I put them. I started keeping a digital dairy on my phone but I seemed to rewrite or deleted the entries, and forget did it\] 

  I have been going to the doctors for 11 years. I have mentioned my memory loss in part but not to its full extent. Yes I know this is a mistake, I honestly am worried about losing my job. I would not be able to support my future family if I can't work. 

But yes I would not be able to support a family if I let my illness take me over. My wife does know, but not the the extent that I previously reviled but I have told her now. That is the background.   I met someone at work \[F26\] about a year ago. I would unexpectedly developed feelings for someone else (I believe an emotional affair though I do not recall talking about anything that personal just work stuff, tv shows books etc). 

Though like most of my friends, I now have large gaps in the freindships.   The main way I communicated with people (when not face to face) was via the messenger app. But either problems with the app at the time or problems with my phone was making ti a hassle so I moved to whatsapp for most people. But this friend used snapchat so we started chatting via that. Which of course is a massive mistake, as I can not look back on the conversations.   \[With my memory loss conversations have become hard.

 But stuff bleeds in, I am able to get some stuff, and though just by having other conversations I am able to pick up on new running jokes etc. But it has gotten so much harder.\]   I didn't realise about this “emotional affair” until to late. My friend now lived in a different city and I visited her in her new city. And this is where it gets super worrying. \[My friend does not know about my mood swings or memory gaps\].   

The emotional affair went against everything believe in, and now the affair turned physical. We went out for drinks with her friends. But stuff happened before we didn't have sex but we got to “second base”. Again I don't remember this, I get minor flashes but I cant “view” it. After we went for drinks more stuff happened, I guess “3rd base”. Again I get flashes but I can not view it fully. I see moments when I really try to focuses. 

The more I try to look back my pain spikes. I do know that we did not have, as we talked about t after wards. I stayed the for 1 night 2 days. I cant not remember most of it. Its like it was somebody else, as cliched as this sounds. I planned to end this friendship after this. Which sucks as she was one of my best friends-but it was the right thing to do. I slowed down my interaction with her but I did not cut contact with her. I wanted to end things face to face. She was my friend and she delivered that. We met up a second time a few weeks ago. My plan was to be honest, talk about the mood swings and my memory gaps.

 That didn't happen. I get flashes of the weekend. Some normal things, watching films, take away food (I cant remember food being delivered, what films bar 1 etc). we left on good terms but I knew something had happened and was off. From what i can tell more messing about- i didn't even cut things off like I planned So I was going to be honest over the phone and cut things off over the phone, which I hated but as I kept loosing such large gaps I had to it. As i said i planned to cut things off but it had been to weeks and haven't been able to call her. She is on shift work which made it hard to find a good time.

 Then Friday evening I got a message from her (my friend's) mom. telling me not to contact her daughter (my friend) ever again and that I had forced myself and no means no. And to never contact her again.   From what I can tell I was/had forced myself. I don't think anything happened but what I had done is fucking disgusting, and now I have also done something that is sexual harassment? Assault? This was killing me I couldn't believe I could have even done something like this. 

I gave an apology but I couldn't remember doing this shit, some flash backs but noting as bad as what I apparently did so the apology was generic as i cant recall most of it. Then yesterday received a message from my former friend. 

She talked about how she did at one point value the friendship. That I ruined it and that I had no respect for my marriage. She did reveal that I tried to kiss her, and tried to unbutton her jeans. And that I kept trying. Though yes still fucking shit, at least I know I'm not a rapist. I said sorry and wished her good luck. 

I did not tell her about the mood swings or memory gaps as, it sounds fake. It sounds like a cop-out. Sadly my friendship has ended with her hating me. Though this isn't how I wanted to do it. I am glad that it did. I know I have to tell my wife what happened, but I don't know how. I barely remember what has happened.

 Like I said, it sounds like a cliche but it feel like it is a different person. My friend unfriended me and my wife on Facebook (but kept other friends of mine). So my wife may realise something is up on her own.   I need to tell her. But I really don't now how. I am looking for a therapist at this very moment. I might tell her AFTER I have seen a therapist, to try and sort out my mind. 

  I know this isn't an easy situation. But any help that can be providence would be grateful.

 \---- How should I tell my wife? When? Has anyone had a situation similar to this?

   \----- How can I ever gain trust of my self again? If I can not gain trust how will my wife be able to? 

\------ Mental illness is an explanation, not an excuse. But if I cant remember, if it doesn't feel like me., How can I take responsibility? 

  Thank you for any help 

 TL/DR: I \[M27\] have chronic pain, mood swings and memory gaps. I had an affair \[F26\] I barely remember having it. It feels like another person. I don't know how to tell my wife \[F27\]of a relationship of 11 years.",10Feb2020,1
86,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask this. But my medication brand has recently changed. I’m unsure as to what brand as my medication comes in weekly blister packs so I don’t receive the packing. Anyway, the 3 100mg tablets that I take at night have no imprint, which they usually do. I thought by law (I’m in the UK) that prescription medication has to have a unique imprint. I’m a bit worried as to what it is they’ve given me. Has anyone else had this? It’s getting to me a bit, but I haven’t noticed any difference when I do take them, still knock me out.

87,"I'm a very intelligent and talented young woman. That's what everyone tells me at least.  However, I have been struggling with various mental health issues since I was 13 (I'm 21 now).  I am extremely ambitious and driven, and that alone I feel has gotten me much further than most people in my situation. I struggle with diagnosed anxiety disorder, depression, PTSD, eating disorders and self-sabotage. 

I go through phases mainly. About 50% (this percentage gets lower and lower each time) of the time, I'll be myself. I'll be happy, funny, outgoing, driven and very resilient. This usually can last anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of months. The other 50% of the time, I'll wake up with this black fog in my head. It stops me from doing so many things. I can't get out of bed or function. I've lost countless jobs and had to drop so many classes at university because I'm constantly trying to do what everyone does in half the time.

The older I get, the worse it's getting. I've been seeing psychologists, have tried medication in the past, I eat very well and am extremely active (exercise is the only thing that makes me feel better a lot of the time). I gave myself PTSD through trying to get through university. I spent so long trying to push past the panic attacks so I could study for more than 5 minutes at a time that I actually managed to traumatize myself quite badly. I can barely even think about uni work anymore and its taken me 2.5 years to get through 1 year of my degree. 

I'm so scared all the time. I've become obsessed with my routine and self medicating in an attempt to try and make the good times last just a little bit longer. I feel so overwhelmed with trying to keep up with everyone around me. My friends are always asking me to go out and do things with them but I get severe anxiety if I try to do anything that might stress me out. Because in my mind, stress=mental health episode. Which subsequently=falling behind in everything again. I've tried to talk to anyone I can about but I just feel so alone. I dont know anyone else who goes through anything like this and people keep telling me I'm being dramatic and that it's just 'normal stress'. But I know its not. My parents put me down whenever I try to talk to them about anything and laugh at me if I tell them I'm struggling. My boyfriend just stays silent and then changes the subject. I don't want to put any of this on anyone anyways because it's not theirs to deal with but holy shit it's hard.

I feel my brain deteriorating and the strong, resilient, lively person I once was is drifting further and further away from reach. I don't know how much longer I can take any of this. I'm silently screaming inside my head in frustration all the time. I found out this was largely due to past traumas and it has left me so resentful towards everyone close to me. Because if my parents had just supported me or told me they loved me every once in a while growing up, maybe I would've been ok. If I had just been born ok, then I could've done incredible things. I feel robbed. I feel so alone. I feel so angry. 

It's like I have this image of the lie I was supposed to have being dangled in front of me and every time I get to close to it, it gets ripped away and instead I get pushed off the edge of a cliff. I've almost lost all hope of recovery. I just wish I had someone who understood what was happening. I just wish I had someone to tell me it's going to be ok and actually know what they're on about because they've been through it too. If this is the rest of my life, I don't think I want to do it.",10Feb2020,1
88,"This isn't the usual 'I have 1 or 2 problems my life is falling apart' thing, I legitimately don't see any way to dig myself out of this pit of despair

Firstly, I have one friend, I love him with all of my heart but because I had absolutely nobody that I felt cared about me for as long as I can remember I became incredibly close to him, we would hang in a call for like 12 hours a day and have done for the last 5 years but for the last few months he has just kind of distanced himself from me, he blocked in in december for messaging him too often despite the fact he just blatantly ignores me for no reason, he unblocked me on friday we chilled in call and had fun all night then the next day he blocks me again because I asked someone else in the call to stop screaming into the microphone, I find myself apologizing for him being an asshole just because I'm terrified of losing him, he's a great guy and I love him like a brother but I think it's at a point where I'm tired of apologizing for everything even if I'm not the one responsible just because it makes it easier, I force myself to deal with his ignorance just because he is all I have, I think about him a lot and I strive to be more like him he's a huge role model to me, but I'm also unhealthily jealous of him, I think about every aspect of his life, compare it to my own disaster of a life and it just makes me sick to my stomach, I go through so many phases pretty quickly like one minute I don't care and I'm fine embracing the inevitable loneliness and the next I'm crying like a baby just wishing I had him to speak to again so I wasn't so alone

On top of all of that, I'm overweight, 240lbs down from 300lbs, I suffer from Body Dysmorphia (not officially diagnosed but doctor said it's likely that) mainly regarding my face and my penis of all things, it's gotten more and more intense as the years have gone on to the point that I can't do ANYTHING in my life without thinking about my looks or how I'm destined for failure, I used to enjoy taking walks but now I can't even leave my house because as soon as I'm on a walk I just break down and start crying hysterically in the middle of nowhere and have to turn back because I'm just overwhelmed by everything, I often stare at trees and just imagine everyones lives if I was gone

I also am not loved, my mum claims she loves me but I know deep down both her and my dad want to convince themselves they care about me, but they don't and never have, absolutely no attention was given to me growing up, my dad made repeated promises that he never followed up on and all my mum dad was let me get fat which is the root cause of almost all my issues in life, my friend had to have a childhood being thin, got to talk to girls, got to hang out with friends all the time, got to feel like he wasn't a disgusting animal but me? I spent my teen years hid away, too self conscious about my body to even show my face (it was solely penis related back then but now I'm just a total wreck, I'm 6 foot 3 and even question if I'm tall enough lately)

On top of that I have low testosterone and gynocomastia which I've dealt with for the last decade which really is a kick to the confidence right there, the low testosterone might be helped with weight loss and working out but I just know deep down that it makes me less of a man, doctors can say what they want but it makes you less of a man being unable to produce something other men can and should be able to

I truly can not experience love or happiness, I truly do not know what it feels like to be loved or to be happy, I thought I did with my friend but I can see now that that friendship has gone down the drain because I mean nothing to him, I've always been the one looking out for him, the other guy in call who he speaks to while I'm blocked has done fucking NOTHING for him, when he was drunk vomiting on himself at the cinema, I helped him while the other friend just sat there didnt even ask if he was ok, same thing happened on a night out we had last year, I was checking my friend was ok and took him to get some air the other friend just fucking sat there and didn't even ask if he was ok and he acts like this motherfucker descended from heaven himself while I'm just some worthless useless ape, I know this friendship is unhealthy (it wasn't always but right now he just has no idea how much he hurts me) but when I think about us not speaking or thinking about never seeing him again I start to panic and I feel dizzy

All I truly want is to be happy, to have what my friend has, a family that I can say 'they love me and I love them' around, to have girls want to speak to me, to not feel like I'm a disgusting animal, every day is just unbearable so I try to take my mind off of things by gambling and masturbating, I gamble every penny I have within a day of getting paid and when that runs out I usually masturbate 4-6 times a day to try to keep myself distracted and get that slight dull dopamine hit since I'm so desensitized to it now, not to mention the masturbating so often and the porn addiction has caused me ED which further just shatters any chance of my happiness because if I somehow got the confidence to speak to a girl on a night out despite how I feel about my looks and we headed back to her place I probably couldn't even get it up further reinforcing that it's embarrassing that I call myself a man

A lot of the time I imagine my future, having a girl and just having someone that I feel cares about me, having a job I like and looking forward to waking up every day, the rest of the time I think about just living my life like a hermit in the wilderness or on the streets, live rough for as long as I can, yeah it would be a terrible lonely and non-ideal existence but at least then I could tell myself I chose loneliness instead of it being thrust upon me

In conclusion, I'm a fat, gambling/porn/masturbation addict with body dysmorphia who is obsessive over his only friend to a pretty unhealthy level and has no direction in life and has almost no chance of salvation because there is so much wrong in my life that it's impossible to focus on improving anything

These are things I always do, but now they all feel boring and useless. I don’t feel sad either, just bored. Nothing really excites me, exept maybe seeing my friends and my boyfriend? I have no plans for the future, no ambitions, and even when I think about the things I could do after my studies, I’m still not excited at all. It’s like I’m always neutral? The only times I feel good is when I’m with my boyfriend and when I have sex... Maybe it’s just some sort of seasonal depression?

I don’t like claiming to have anything but it’s just seems like my life is a spin cycle of pain and joy but it’s months on end of months of overwhelming , crippling sadness followed by maybe a few weeks worth of genuine happiness and euphoria. 
I can’t live like this. I can’t work properly when I think about how I just want to disappear and never come back. Staring blank and carrying out my day like a robot. I do things to make me happy like fashion, art, video games but it’s temporary. I experiment with relationships but it seems like not even someone who’s madly in love with me can’t pull me out of this well.

I feel like a failure in every aspect of life. 30 years old. Haven't had a relationship in over 7 years. Keep having to start over in life for one reason or the other. Don't have many friends, and I can understand why. Sleep isn't easy to come by but when it does waking up is even harder. Barely taking care of myself.

In high school, my cognitive ability was so dysfunctional that I literally could not plan out my day, listen through a whole song, or drive a car, much less hold down a part time job.

I went into shutdown mode again. I got so depressed and anxious that days passed without me noticing. Months went by and I hardly registered them until I looked at a calendar. I couldn't bring myself to answer phone calls, let alone leave my room. I just couldn't do it anymore. EVERYTHING feels like too much. I can't think, I can't focus, and I'm so depressed I have no motivation. I don't have any goals because I can't imagine any future where I'm happy or fulfilled. The only thing I feel about myself, is hatred.

I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried treatment, and every time it's just a stall to my next big shut-down. I'm hardly managing the adult responsibilities, let alone basic needs. I came off all my medications the hard way, quickly. My appetite is gone. My sleep schedule is beyond ruined. Frankly, the thing that holds me back most is just not wanting to live, and that's a problem I can't seem to fix. 

I have worked my ass off, dissociated a hard as I could for as long as I could just to make it all work. For years I promised myself I would make things happen and figure it all out. But I never get enough rest. I never recover enough. I never have enough energy left over to keep everything working. Needs and responsibilities fall through the cracks and everything piles up.

I've had diagnoses range from ADHD, Autism, OCD, variations of Bipolar, Gender Dysphoria, and more. I relate most to the Asperger's and Dysphoria diagnoses but frankly I don't know what it is that's wrong with me and more than that I don't know what to do. For the fourth time in my life I'm sitting here in the rubble of the life I failed to keep, and I don't know what else to do.

I used to dissociate as hard as possible but I really don't think I can do that anymore. I'm out of energy and I'm lost. I can't even function normally. What am I supposed to do? It's all falling apart again and I can't even get myself to do anything about it. I don't WANT to keep it all up just to function socially and publicly. The anxiety is constant and it's so horrible.

104,"Hiya. I'm a 23 year old transgender man diagnosed with cPTSD, panic disorder, and major depressive disorder. I've been on medication for my depression for a while. I really helped with my panic for a while. But lately things have been really bad. My eating disorder has relapsed and my anxiety is through the roof. 

Tonight I have been so anxious and my thoughts have been all over the place, and I spent the whole day in bed without realising. Then my partner sent me an innocuous message and it made me start crying and having all these scary thoughts. I think they were about not deserving to be loved, being a bad person, etc. Then I started remembering childhood trauma and I came to some sort of conclusion that I have been put in this world to suffer and that it's some kind of punishment because I am so inherently bad. It eventually just descended into suicidal ideation. 

Then I needed to go to the toilet so I got up and it was like I had been thrust into an entirely different brain, all these thoughts just disappeared, I stopped crying and I can't even imagine the feelings I was having before. I objectively recognise some of them but for the most part they're pretty much gone. Even reading through the post I've written so far you can see that the emotional charge is just about gone. Reading back I can also see things that I now don't remember. 

Before the medication this happened a LOT, for pretty much my whole life. I have never been able to communicate it to a therapist brcause I rarely remember that this even happens. It was just kind of normal for me to spend nights crying and fantasizing about how I deserve to suffer. It feels like it has become more than dangerous and I'm really scared of what will happen to me if I don't explain what's going on to a professional. But I have no idea how. 

I have tried to explain to professionals that I have intense feelings and memories and then forget them, but that's pretty standard for PTSD and they don't really know what to do with it. I don't know how to communicate the severity because I don't even remember what I was thinking. 

I feel like I've written an entire novel but I just really needed to talk about this before I wake up tomorrow feeling wonky and having no idea why.

I had been at a conference for work all week and we went to her hometown the day after my conference (this is like 5 hours away) where she tended to her mother as she was taking care for her dying father (my GFs grandfather). So on our way back from her hometown, she is quiet the whole time because she is in her head about seeing her grandfather for the last time. I try to console her for a couple of days but for some reason when we are in the car, i feel a lack of empathy which is not normal for me. Usually i am very empathetic toward people and I try to provide life advice and care for people who aren't feeling the best. About an hour into the ride i begin to disassociate and i cant respond to anything my GF is saying. After awhile i hit myself in the head and burn myself with a cigarette and she notices and tells me to stop. She is aware i am hurting myself on purpose but we both kind of brush it off and i am telling myself to stop. After awhile we start talking and we plan to get food because i have purposely not eaten this day. I may have an eating disorder but idk. I just hate eating because i think ill be more unattractive if i eat. My girlfriend eats her food as we are driving down the road. I let mine get cold and after about an hour, i get it out and i look at the food. It makes me so angry that i crush it up without taking a bite and I throw in into a bag to throw away. My girlfriend becomes irritated but at this point i feel like i have no control over my actions. Everything is being controlled by emotion and all logic is gone. I begin to plan ways of jumping out of the car and i tell myself things will be better if i just get it over with and kill myself. I am caught up in this headspace and i disassociate again for about 30 mins. i break out of it once and i go from a blank face to balling my eyes out within seconds. Quickly after i dry up my tears and smile and then go back into that disassociation. Some conversation happens between the two of us and it is apparent that both of us are ready to be out of this car. Soon after, something happens and my brain snaps and i start beating the hell out of my face with my fist over and over again. My girlfriend begins to scream in my ear about how bad that was to do. She says ""do you want me to crash this car and kill us both"" ""i think about hurting myself alot but i dont do it."" This causes me to close off very quickly and i begin to shake. I was diagnosed with PTSD and i was triggered by that screaming and my brain told me I was about to be hit very hard by my girlfriend due to past relationships. She would never do this. She is very supportive. We didnt really talk about it much afterwards because i closed off and I couldnt let her touch me. This causes her to feel alone in this time of pain due to her family member passing away and it makes me feel like a fucked up crazy person because i couldnt stop what happened even though the person i care about is going through alot and she doesnt need this in her life. My brain is telling me to just run away from it all and that will allow her to have a better life but im not sure. I feel like i need help because this sounds like something a crazy person would do. I just had this episode of self hatred and i couldnt stop from hurting myself even though it was in front of another person and in a car which is a bad place to do that. Any opinions on this situation? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Again sorry for the scattered thoughts. I'm still alittle shaken up from yesterday.

TLDR: I Mike Tysoned my face and planned to jump out of a car while with my girlfriend (who is loosing her grandfather) because i'm a crazy person.",10Feb2020,1

Help, I'm alone in a world.. Unloved and lonely. All I do is work and go home..I tried looking for hobbies.. My town is  just small and made of mostly families. 

On top of that the only person who loved me walked away from my yesterday... I dont blame her, I was a shit boyfriend because  I didn't love myself...I took out my low self esteem on her, wanted to change her, and pushed and pulled.. I was a dick. She was perfect either...we both were negative people and it made a perfect storm

I keep seeking help... (Therpay, focus groups, hobbies.) Nothing works. I've felt this way for 3 years now.  I've became addicted in  to strip clubs  in the meanwhile  to get out of the house, talk and  actually  be touched.. I can go months and weeks at a time without a hug otherwise...

The thing is I know part of the problem is me. I am a negative  person that tends to over think...I am my father's son. I push people away... 

Im at working writing this barely holding  back tears.. I'm not suicidal  now I dont have the guts too. But If this continues  like this for another three year I dont know...I hate typing that... I do. I had a friend that committed  suicide  three years ago and saw the damage.  

But the more life keeps going this way the more I'm starting to understand why... I just want to be at peace  I'm tired  of worrying, tired of feeling u loved.....

Long story short could medication  be a key or am I once again putting hope into a false god? Has anyone else hit a lonely rock bottom?

I am struggling a lot with a traumatic event (which didn't directly involve me but affected me greatly). I will not go into details about what happened, but in short, last November my ex boyfriend killed his mom.

Please bear with me as I try to share a little bit of the backstory as well as I can. This may be long-winded.
He was my cousin's best friend. I've known him for years, and had a crush on him through most of it. As anyone who knew him can attest, he was always the nicest, most caring, goodhearted person. He was so gentle and introspective. He was so kind and full of life. He was genuine, he was present, he listened. He was my best friend at one point in my life. He was one of the best people I ever knew. Our relationship, when he was in a good place, was a happy one. It was a time in my life that was just so simple and easy. I was so in love with him. He was my first love and my first everything. But he was also very ill. I know many people won't be able to understand this, but I'll say it anyway - I believe he is just as much a victim in all of this as his mom. I acknowledge that it may be hard to understand that without having known him, and believe me, I've seen my fair share of horrendous, disgusting, hateful comments made about him by people who don't know a thing about him or the situation at all, so please trust me when I tell you that he was truly one of the best people I ever knew. 'Tragic' doesn't even begin to describe it – this situation or his life. 
Anyway, he and I began dating in spring 2013. Our relationship didn't last very long, I broke it off in November 2013. I wasn't fully aware of his mental illness when we began seeing each other, I had heard things early on but to me he was still just this sweet, soft-spoken guy I had a crush on for years. In all honesty, I was a naïve 20-year-old and I probably just saw what I wanted to see. But it wasn't too long before it started to become apparent to me that he was sick. So I eventually ended things. 
And after our relationship ended, he would occasionally show up at my house over the next couple of years, just looking for me or leaving random gifts in my mailbox or saying concerning (though non-threatening) things to my mom, and I think it wasn't until then that I really began to realize the depth of his illness, because I believe it was during this time that it started to get really bad. Back when we were together, he seemed normal most of the time, but would occasionally say things that didn't make any sense. He thought my cousin and other friends of his were trying to hurt him, he thought people were listening on the internet, etc. He even walked to my mom's place from his house several miles away in his pajamas with pillows and blankets and wanted to stay there (two years after we broke up), which freaked me out at the time but of course I now see as a cry for help. I've learned that he would often try to ""run away"" (he was in his 20s), and his mom would hide his keys. Or if he did leave, his mom would report him missing or go to his friend's houses looking for him. I've also heard rumors that she sexually abused him, though I don't know for sure. His mom was CLEARLY mentally ill and couldn't hold a coherent conversation at all. We all believe they are/were schizophrenic (his lawyer practically confirmed that in a roundabout way when I spoke to him a couple months back). I'd be lying if I said a small part of me wasn't a little afraid of what he might be capable of, despite the fact that he didn't seem to have a violent bone in his body. I worried over the next few years that he might do something to harm himself, but I never thought it would come to this. From the bottom of my heart, I wish I could have been there for him and done more to help him. What I viewed then as unannounced, uncomfortable, and unwanted contact in the months and years following our break-up, I now see as a desperate, heartbreaking plea for help. I wasn't there for him when he needed a friend and when he really needed help, and for that I am culpable. I'll be candid and say that I handled the whole situation so poorly because I simply did not know how to deal with it, and that guilt and regret is something I carry with me every day and I know I always will.

Eventually he stopped coming around and was no longer in my life. I still thought about him often over the last few years and wondered how he was, worried about what might happen to him. The truth is, I loved him a lot at one time in my life, and he meant so much to me. Although I'm happily married now and my concern for him has nothing to do with romantic feelings, I still care about him deeply and I think I always will. He is severely mentally ill and, again, I believe what happened is just as much a tragedy for him as it is for his mother. I truly believe he didn't kill his mother, but his disease did.

When I first heard the horrific news a little over a year ago, I was in shock. I couldn't believe it happened. My heart broke for him. And for her. I felt terrible. But I almost feel like I didn't fully process it until now. I can go periods without thinking about it too much, but then other times it'll be on my mind all day every day. Within the last couple of months, it's hitting me like a ton of bricks and I feel like I can't stop thinking about him.
I recently found out that he's a psychiatric hospital, which is the best place he can be now, but I worry about what will happen to him next. The thought of him spending the rest of his life in prison behind bars (or worse) truly haunts me.
What's bothering me the most lately is this feeling that I want to be there for him in some capacity. But it's not that simple. I've thought about whether I should try to visit him someday or write a letter, but given our history and the fact that he's clearly gotten worse in the years since I last saw him, I don't know if that's what's best for him. I don't want to trigger him in any way or make him become fixated on me again. There's also the possibility that the fact that he got so much worse over the years, combined with the horrific trauma he went through, and the medication he's surely on, his mind and the person I once knew may very well be gone, and that scares and saddens me more than I can express. I feel like I'm grieving someone who is still alive, yet gone, if that makes any sense. On the other hand, he may be MORE stable now because of medication and counseling, and I try to put myself in his shoes and imagine how lonely, isolated, and confused he must be. No one has gone to visit him from what I've gathered. He must think he has no one and that everyone hates him. I can't imagine how much it might mean to him to know that people still care about him and don't think he's a monster. And having a support system is so important, right?

The whole situation is just so disturbing and heartbreaking and I have no idea what I should do or how to deal with this. It's been worse lately because my husband is away at Air Force OTS right now so I'm staying at my mom's house for a couple of months, which is where this all took place. All of the memories are flooding back and I feel like I'm living in the past. My family and husband (he is especially uncomfortable with it) think I should stop pursuing this in any way and ""move on"", but I don't know how. Or if I should. No one understands how heavily this is weighing on me. Recently, I mentioned him in front of my mom and her response was to snap ""why do you still care? Let it go."" And a couple of weeks ago I was talking to my husband and told him that someone had mentioned how I have been though a trauma and he said ""how is that a trauma for you though?"" I just feel like no one gets it, but I'm sure many of you will. 

This became much more lengthy than I meant for it to be, but if you're still reading, thank you. Also, please, please be kind and try to be understanding. I realize that this is a very unique situation and not very ""relatable"", I think I'm just really looking for support, advice, and guidance on how to navigate all of this because it is overwhelming and consuming and I feel like I'm carrying a huge burden. And I feel like I'm doing it alone.
If you have any further questions about this situation please feel free to ask, I don't mind talking about it 🖤",10Feb2020,1
117,"'m not sure this is the right place for this. If not, please tell me where to go. Ty!

I (34f) dont know how to help my dh (36m), or if I even can. I'm not entirely sure what is wrong. He has mild anxiety and add.  Add is kinda medicated. During the day, things are mostly fine. Anxiety bumps sometimes, but generally things are good. 

At night, he says he brain doesnt shut up. (Which, I get. Mine does that too sometimes.)  Sometimes its conversations or arguments from the past. Sometimes worry from the future. He says that its annoying and makes it hard to sleep.  But something changed. 

Now, hes been having what he calls ""existential dread"". And last night was so bad that while we were cuddling, he was trying not to cry.   It's been like that for a little while now.  Wait don't know why. Or what's going on. I dont know how to help.  Can I help? I'm sure this is a ""just be there for him"" type thing.  But how do I do that? And most importantly, how does he help himself? Is this a dr thing?",10Feb2020,1
118,"I think my brain functionality is off and it concerns me to a degree.

It's not that I suppress them, it's not that I fail to recognize there; they are literally not there; to check this out I tried different drugs to alter my emotional state, alcohol being the most accessible, but also THC, Coke, Caffeine to ridiculous amounts, which is supposed to get you uninhibited or change you; I was with a friend, all the physical effects appeared, but mentally I was unmovable.

This applies as well for all non prescription painkillers, and almost all mental medication, of which they have tried but is like taking a placebo.

On one hand this allows me to be able to be in front of a multitude and talk like it's nothing, makes me immune to depression and anxiety; so most doctors (as seen during my childhood) have been as, ""nothing to fix just go on as you are"".

But also no shame, no regret, no empathy, no guilt, no sense of morality; I just don't do wrong, because I do what makes sense and what doesn't waste my time and increases value, not because I intrinsically care. Which funnily most people think that I have high standard morals, when in reality I just do what makes sense, I also do help a lot of people, because it makes sense to increase my worth and in turn my influence; I don't know what to say, but ironically, I seem to be able to keep friendships for longer.

So there are only some partial fear, anger, happiness, fulfillment, love, and not much else; everything else is just logic, in fact, that's my job, I am a data analyst and automation engineer, because honestly, what else can I do?

I am worried to lose the logic layer as I age, in fact probably is one of the few fears I have left; a few people in my family lost their mind to the point they died, all of them immune to most drugs, there was always one or two in each generation for generations, that would suddenly snap, not in the current, and time is due, maybe it's me, maybe I am a ticking clock.",10Feb2020,1

121,"Hey folks,

This is my first ever.post to reddit. I follow a few things and browse here and there. Until now I never thought I'd post. 

I'm working as a touring lighting guy in Australia. The company I tour with is very close knit to say the least. To the point there's a few relationships in the touring party and they're beautifu, honest and friendlyl relationships. Personally, I stick by the rule of don't shit where you eat. 

Tonight a friend in the touring party had a bad time on a number of levels. None of which were to do with her. However mainly the complexity of touring for the majority of your current life. She had such a bad night I asked her to come outside for a chat. I wanted to know if she was okay. 
As soon as we left the room she broke down. She broke down to the point we walked 20m down the street and sat on the kerb and had a chat...

For me, this had been the only time I had, had to have had the chat of ""are you okay?"". As far as I had remembered, O was only ever asked that. 
So I called my other friend with my first friends permission, she also came down and helped me out immensely. I guess what I'm asking is... How do you follow up with someone if the original questions was ""are you okay?"". 

I'm scared and confused for my friend.",10Feb2020,1
122,"I grew up with an emotionally and occasionally physically abusive mother. I don’t think she really* knows she was though or means it. She just seems to lack control over her emotions and behaviours, something would upset her and without warning she would lash out screaming, breaking things, being awful to us.. and then would just as suddenly be totally fine and act like it didn’t happen or maybe cry and apologize. She also “forgets” (or pretends she forgets) sometimes when she does something, almost like she can’t handle it and swears she would’ve never said x even when I know there’s no way I’m* imagining it. My family and I have all talked to her about maybe just talking to someone and she’s always refused because “her life is so busy” or she refuses because “why? So they can tell me I’m crazy? I already know”. She is also manipulative, self obsessed, and all of this was sever enough to an extent that I have dreams and nightmares about things that have happened and was under the age of ten and I would sneak into her room to make sure she wasn’t dead because she used to suggest she should kill herself because we were so ungrateful etc. Despite all of that she is somehow so loving and caring, it just doesn’t come across because she is also so hurtful, it’s hard for me to think of her being nice and her being mean as the same person. She has gotten better and doesn’t get as aggressive as often but still gets “unhinged”. 

My question: does this sound like my mom struggles from a mental illness or is she just not the best person?

129,"So I’m 15 and in my second last year of secondary/comprehensive school (high school), as I am in the uk. I have always hated school but right now it is really causing me depression and anxiety. I hate the boring lessons and how I need to put on a facade to my friends to seem happy when I would much rather be as far away from school as possible. One of the reasons I hate it is because of the people in it. I am a boy and all of my friends are, yet so many of them are just annoying and immature. I just want to chill and sit peacefully. As long as I can sit with no one bothering me, I’m fine. That’s why I rarely ever feel depressed on the school holidays when I don’t have to wake up everyday and go to school. Being someone who just wants to be left to chill and get on with my day, I hate all the lively physical banter of my friends. Talking and joking is fine, because I do it too. But when people are pushing each other around, jokingly grabbing or hitting each other and just generally acting like idiots, I hate it. I just want to be peaceful and chill out but my friends act like crackheads which in turn makes me anxious for going to school.

I also feel bored or depressed a lot of the time both in and outside of school. I don’t even have low self esteem or anything like that and i don’t feel sad like how people feel when something bad happens to them, I just feel fed up and powerless to do anything. I am forced to go to school nearly everyday, come home and try to kill my boredom until I go to sleep for the night, which I usually have a hard time doing anyway. Then I have to wake up really early for school whilst arguing and getting shouted at by my mother. This happens day-in day-out. The only time I feel truly happy and carefree is when I’m drinking alcohol on a weekend. My parents let me drink a limited amount of alcohol on the weekend. I don’t get blackout drunk from it, but it makes me feel happy and like i can get away from all my stress and anxiety which I experience throughout the week. I wouldn’t say I’m an alcoholic, but if I could have unlimited alcohol whenever I wanted then there would be a high chance that I would be one. On top of all this, I have undiagnosed OCD which causes me some stress and even minor delusions at times but I don’t want to tell my parents as I have had it since before I even knew what OCD was and if I told my mother then she would probably think I was overreacting or being weird.

Sometimes I just think that if I had antidepressants or anxiety meds etc. then I would be so much more happy, stress free and care free. Sometimes I have even felt suicidal, however, I have never seriously self-harmed or attempted suicide. I just don’t know how to cope at this point. If I had life my way then I would just sleep and eat all day and drink during the evenings until I fall asleep again, playing games on my computer and watching YouTube or netflix in between for some enjoyment.

This is my first time talking about my mental health properly at all. I’ve told my mother about how I hate school but she just answers with the stock answer of ‘Well everyone has had to go through it.’ which doesn’t make me feel better at all. It just makes me long for the day that I can leave school fully even more.

I just need to know how to cope with life as I can’t keep living with anxiety and depression like this for much longer. I’m not saying that I’m fully suicidal but I just want a way to get out of everything that I hate, such as school, annoying and immature people around me and general all-around depression.",10Feb2020,1
130,"CHANGE IS SIMPLY DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
At some point in life, everyone will need to make a change or adapt to new situations. No matter how small, it can be the most important decision in
someone’s life. The change you make can be the difference between six figures or a 9-5 for the rest of your life. A person who really wants to achieve big dreams can’t have small thoughts. 
A person who wants to be better simply has to make decisions that will make them better.


Doesn’t everyone have something they all want? The important thing is understanding why you
need to change for it to be possible. You can’t fix a problem that you aren’t aware of. Just like
someone with an illness, they first have to see the symptoms before they decide to get help.
Instead of thinking about changing your perspective as a difficult task, just think about it as a real-life issue with a simple solution.
Now that we’ve established what change is and why it is important, let’s look at ways we can facilitate change.


Keep in mind that what works for someone else might not work for you so be open-minded.

- Lying/ Manipulating/ generally cunning and deceitful to friends, family and strangers

- Inability to feel regret or guilt 

- Superior feeling around most 

- Constant and obsessive desire to control people and situations 

- Emotional numbness in general (sometimes completely sometimes less) 

- Discontent with my success / constantly wanting to do more and never being satisfied with how far I’ve come 

- Selfishness

- Very forgetful and absent minded / caught up in my own world with my own goals and desires 

- In general the things I respond to the most are things that boost my ego, get me money, success, and give me control over people. 

- I will watch videos of people getting tortured and killed and beheaded to feel something at all / videos of war and people begging for their life and getting killed regardless make me feel (not good but something) 

- I have taken thousand of dollars worth of LSD and have experimented with ecstasy and marijuana as well. Haven’t had any drugs other than alcohol in almost a year 

Childhood:

- I was very distracted / stressed / attention seeking

- I would kill animals every now and then (Baby birds/ cut heads off snakes/ found a goats decaying head and strung it up about 10 feet in the woods with a rope through its eyes/ shot squirrels for no reason/ knocked cats out of tall trees/ had dreams of killing animals/ grew out of it) 

- No objective trauma 

I am not asking to be diagnosed and I am going to see a psychiatrist this month and also begin therapy. I just got out of a 9 month relationship and hurt people in the process of it. I basically have periods of times where I can’t feel any emotion at all and it made it hard for me to take care of my partner and feel for her when I can’t feel for myself. She left because she learned that I have had episodes where I cannot feel sometimes lasting just a day but it was usually for weeks at a time of not longer and I suppose I didn’t think if it as pretending or lying to her as I had learned to function in my day to day life by going through the motions of what I’m expected to do and not just sit around like a stump on a log. I have no resentment for her feeling how she does and I know I hurt her and in the moment of seeing her cry and leave it hurt. A lot. But the second she was gone I was fine and I still feel fine like it was just another day. I used to get enjoyment from hurting people this way. Manipulating them. Getting my use from them and getting rid of them. I never intended that with this person but it happened still. I just don’t understand why I am so cold and enjoy it generally. I’m obsessed with control over people and me being in charge of everything that happens in my life. If anyone could respond with comments or questions or advise regarding what I should consider thinking about that would be useful. Like I said I am going to see a psychiatrist and therapist so I’m not asking for a diagnosis and it’s hard to pin point what I’m looking for. I suppose for someone to understand? Would love to hear constructive feedback. I am finally taking legitimate steps to seek help and I guess that’s a good starting place to understanding myself and maybe feeling in the future.",10Feb2020,1
133,"I feel like my cup is completely empty but I keep trying to pour out of it.

Some context – I'm (26F) trying to balance a full-time job, 20 hour/week freelance side gig, paying basically all of the bills while my boyfriend gets back on his feet (he's working too, just was out of a job for a while and now very behind on bills), and trying not to completely lose it. I feel like I go to therapy and every week she tells me what I need to do for self-care and that I need to listen to my gut and make time for healthy habits and daily rituals. And then I just...don't do it. 

My anxiety is driving me through my life and it's getting completely exhausting. I'm on medication and experimenting with dosages and I'm going to therapy but outside of that, I'm being stupid with my own mental health and wellbeing. I give into the impulse to eat out constantly, I drink casually even though being hungover sends me spiraling every time, and I don't make time for self-care routines. This causes me to snap at my boyfriend. I feel like I need much more alone time but always feel so guilty when I send him off to his mom's or friend's house for the night. 

I had a mini breakdown this morning. I got up at 6 like usual, got to work, settled in, and then noticed a message from my bf's mom. She was telling me she found a picture of me on FB from 8 years ago where I ""look better."" She in short said ""hope this doesn't come across the wrong way, but I needed to tell you how much healthier and prettier you look here."" First of all, I was 18 in the picture. Wearing about 5 pounds of makeup and dressed to go out clubbing. It took everything in me not to say that I have been carrying the load of so many people around me and I'm definitely aware I looked better when I was a literal teenager.

This is more to vent and see if anyone else has snapped themselves out of something like this. I know exactly what I need to do – I need to learn to say no, I need to slow down, I need to eat mindfully, stop doing things that make me feel sick, make sure I have alone time without worrying about my boyfriend's feelings, and not be so sensitive to critical comments.

But three years ago I picked up a knife at work, not for no reason, I was working the sandwich line. My first thought was ""slit your throat."" 

Obviously I didn't do it, but it took all my willpower to put it down and walk away for a few minutes. Not more than a few weeks later I intentionally sliced open my palm and told everyone it was an accident. Shortly after I had another extreme thought at home and had to put away the knife and just not be in the kitchen.

I had no more issues other than small thoughts like ""what if I just cut myself right here, right now."" until recently at my new job, and I had to tell a coworker that it was probably a bad idea for me to be around knives. I don't know what's wrong, not a clue, just wanted to share in case anyone else ever had those sorts of extreme thoughts.",10Feb2020,1

138,"So last year around March to May I started having the strangest thoughts and even started to see things at night. I also started to believe that all my coworkers were against me, plotting something and for some reason thought they were in a cult and I would be their next victim. I even thought my family was in a cult too and might hurt me somehow. I became heavily paranoid, in a way that it started to show and I struggled to continue with my normal routines. I eventually sought help on my own, and received treatment. Eventually the treatment worked, but the damage had already been done and there was no way to explain my irrational behaviour to anyone other than my close family and S.O..

My boss however wasn't angry with me and overall it was going well, but my colleague seemed to like trying to embarrass me in front of my managers and other colleagues aswell.

some in deeper some
 just in the shalows
 Some seem to be showed with help
 Just by rasing a hand 
 Some scream and panic 
 too  loud hear to help Thay are given

An invisible list 
For what I'm not sure 

I'm not asking for a boat
to pull me out and sail me away 
Or a crane to lift me high above it all
 I'm asking for maby a step or a stool 
 Hell I'd take a panflit 
 on how to make one for my self 
Just enough help so I can breath
 for longer than a  second 
 So i can lern to swim 
 So I can try to find the shore 
 And maby try to get out
  of the ocean of sludg
  I'm lost and drowning in  
But no I'm on a list 
A fucking list
 the bottom of the list 
To be asested for my worthyness 
To receive the panflit 
Maby not  evan the right panflit

My brain finds ANY reason to cling onto this delusion, and yet the only thing it has running for it left - it's last ammunition - is the changes in expression I notice ""in reaction"" to my thoughts, which I know is just me reading too much into pixel rendering. Maybe my social cue process is so good I'm finding cues where there are none, pointing out anything that could be ever so slightly perceived as a reaction - I've always been good at reading stuff. Guess it turned on me.

I know the mindset I need to be in - it's just ignoring my artificial insecurities, but it's staying in that mentality that I am not strong enough to do.

Where I come from, there was always emphasis on ""looking tough"", being a criminal, doing that rap shit.

When I was bumped up to 300 mg, I ended up getting a dermatitis-like rash on my arm in a very small area. My psychiatrist quickly yanked me off of it and the withdrawals were horrible. I had taken it for several years at that point so it was a huge adjustment. There was no definitive proof the rash was the dreaded Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, but my psych said it wasn’t worth the risk.

That was 2018 and my new psychiatrist said he would feel comfortable with me going back on Lamictal at a lower dose. I’ve been on it now for about 2 months. Today, I suddenly got another dermatitis-like rash in a similar spot. I do have a history of struggling with dermatitis from environmental allergens, but I can’t think of anything that could have caused it today.

Has anyone else ever gotten a rash like this while on Lamictal and it turned out to be fine?

My current therapist doesn't really spend much time talking about how things make me feel and we mostly just talk about how to fix things, for example, I might say ""I feel bad on mondays"" and then she might ask why and I'll be like ""I don't know just tired"" and she'll say ""okay well how can we make Mondays be better for you..."" and then plan for something for me to do on Mondays.

Info about myself 


I've always been the outsider/misfit whenever I was meant to be around people. I was first exposed to others in my age in kindergarten that I attended when I was 5 years old for the very first time and since then I was never really accepted into other groups of people. The only friend I had in preschool till middleschool was extremely toxic and kept bullying me until I was capable of telling teachers about it. It was really hard for me to do so because since she was the only friend I had I didn't want to accept that she's bad for me. I tried getting along with my classmates, but they just kicked me out of their friend group by ignoring me and not intending to spend time with me, although I really tried to talk to them. At the same time I had my parents blaming me for being shy and even if they talked to the teachers about it, they didn't really try to be there for me. I never really had anyone to rely on. I often felt left alone with myself and I don't talk much. A lot of things happened in my family that probably affected me a lot, there's a lot about it, but I'll just mention the things that I really the most. When I was younger I was really close to my step-sister. (she's 16 years older than I am ) and I felt like she was someone who'd be there for me, but then she just left me alone and we didn't talk for at least 8 years now. The other thing is that I saw my eldest step-brother (he's about 20 years older than I am) beating up my dad recently badly and blood was everywhere and I had to call an ambulance and police. I found out that way that my step-brother is a searched criminal apparently and has a large history of physically harming people.  


Things I stuck with and I don't know what is going on with me:


I've always been extremely shy and insecure about meeting new people,and I get extremely nervous and scared around strangers. I don't like being hugged or touched by strangers and my it was really hard for me to let one of my friends hug me. 


I'm extremely scared of hospitals, syringes and everything about it. I had to give blood three times yet and each of these times I was crying and shaking without having any control about it. 


I react really unusually to screams. 
Any kind of screams,but screams of pain of fear are the worst for me. My body kinda goes numb and I feel like I can't move or I'm feeling like I'm about to pass out. If a baby is screaming it causes me to react completely differently. I get really angry, to a point where it's really hard for me to control myself and I might even try to break things and might as well hurt myself in the process. 


I hope I can find some help here. 
If there are any further questions about it I'll try to answer them as good as I can.
Thanks a lot for your attention.

165,For the past 6-8 months my ex-husband has been struggling with depression. At first he was attempting self help with positive mental attitude stuff but gave up on it. He tried to seek help with our local state mental health facilities but they pretty much told him you're just depressed and gave him a prescription for an antidepressant. After a few months on the meds he had a breakdown and locked himself in his house and was threatening suicide. I called his family and they went to him and talked him down. He blamed it on the Paxil and stopped taking it but didn't seek help again. Last week he attempted suicide by taking the whole prescription bottle of Paxil. He was rushed to the emergency room and kept over night for observation and sent home the next day. Now it's 2 days from the kid exchange and he expects me to keep the normal schedule despite what happened. This doesn't feel right to me. It doesn't feel safe. My gut instinct says don't let my 4 y/o go for a while. Is this the right thing to do? How long should I keep the kid away? Could this make things worse?,10Feb2020,1

167,"So I dont know if im becoming emotionally numb cuz I have had very emotional and depressive past 2, years. But I am scared that I am starting to lose my emotions, I feel happy and alive but I dont remember the true feeling of happiness, and I think that my feelings are rather reflexes than real emotions. Like whenever when I feel some emotions they dont seem real at all, it doesnt matter if they are disgust, sadness, happyness, goofyness but it doesnt feel real. I used to cry a lot because its such a good way to let emotions out and vent, but even when I am sad it doesnt feel like real sadness and when things are so rough for me I still cant cry. I haven't cried in 2 weeks and I can feel the pressure increasing, I just have so many problems, I dont know if I can pass my middle school exams (9th grade), my social life is non existent, im a total misfit in school, I cant express myself creatively because whenever I try to draw or to sth creative and fail, I give up. Can somebody please explain me what the fuck is going on with my mind, im so confused and I dont know what to do with my life. Im so scared what will happen to me in the future and it all piled up and I cant take it anymore I just wish to disappear from this world and be in peace, I dont want this world anymore, I just want to give up but even giving up is so hard lately.

When I'm around other people they can read my thoughts. His spies are among us, possessing ordinary people around me. I've never been a spiritual or superstitious person but this idea has been growing stronger and stronger every day. 

Why am I letting the internet know this? I'm not sure why I'm writing this.. what if God controls all of you, what if he makes you manipulate me with your comments?

175,"So, I just turned 18 recently and my parents have been kicking me out constantly. The only reason they keep letting me back is because I am so close to finishing school. I plan to be done completely with school on 2/13/20. They refuse to talk to me and honestly I'm fine with it because I've always felt very judged by them and like I can't have my own thoughts or feelings. All my life I have just wanted to make my parents proud but it feels like no matter what I do they are just always mad at me. People say that I'm being emotionally abused because of the things they say to me but I don't know if I'm ready to accept that yet. Today my mom came in my room to help me schedule an appointment to get my IUD and started yelling at cussing at me because I wasn't asking all the right questions. Then the lady on the phone very angrily asked ""Do I just need to talk to your mom or what?"" I almost broke down.

177,"I (25F) met a guy (25M) on Bumble about 5 months ago. We hit it off immediately and had a very strong connection.  Things progressed at a very rapid rate - within a couple months, he was professing his love for me, talking about how he couldn't wait to get married and have kids and settle in Toronto (our hometown) with me. I thought it was moving a bit fast, but after a previous relationship that ended in infidelity, it felt nice to be wanted like that, so I leaned into it and let things move quickly. I fell completely in love with this guy and saw a real future with him, and he said he felt the same way over and over again. He called me the love of his life and offered me the key to his apartment a week before he went on vacation to Hawaii for a week. 

Fast forward one week, he has a great time in Hawaii, and apparently it ""awakens"" something in him - he no longer wants to settle in Toronto with me; he wants to move around and explore and eventually put down roots somewhere else. He knew I wouldn't want the same (we discussed this early on in our relationship - I want to stay in Toronto to be close to family and work on my career), so we ended things. Now, I don't mind someone figuring out what they truly want in life, but this man confessed that by the time he got back from Hawaii, his feelings for me had died. How can someone go from calling me the love of their life and wanting to settle down with me so badly, to not wanting a life with me at all, in the span of a single week? I genuinely thought that he loved me, but love doesn't disappear so quickly. Either he never really loved me or he only loved the idea of me because I fit into the life he originally thought he wanted. Or, there's something genuinely wrong with him, where he can switch his emotions on and off like a light switch.

I’ve tried about 5 now and they all don’t make me feel better they just make me not give a shit about anything.

184,"I am a 20 year old female, with a 16 month old son. I got pregnant when I was 18 years old, the guy was 32. We met at his work (he sold me a vehicle) and I was super into him immediately. I found that as we went on dates, I was very confused. I noticed he was very dry at times. He barely texted me, didn’t try to hold on much of a conversation on dates. Then other times, he was a lot of fun. I think I was just excited someone older was into me. I had sexual experience before and a couple “in school” boyfriends, but he was the first real guy I actually went on dates with. I got pregnant very fast. I knew him about 3 weeks, and was pregnant. I tried really hard to make things work for the fact we had a child together and I wanted us to make this work and be a family. He promised me he loved me, didn’t want anyone else, wanted to spend his life with me. I was very immature and broke up with him every other week. Once I found tinder in his phone and he told me that it was there from before we met, but I never remembered that. I was very drunk that night and we were staying at a resort for his work function. I got upset and left the hotel room. I ended up in his co workers room asking him to call my boyfriend. He tried to feel me up. He was a disgusting old man probably early 50’s. My boyfriend came to the room and just said “let’s go”. He never tried talking to me about the tinder thing. He never tried apologizing. He made no effort at all to really be with me. The next issue was when we were supposed to be moving in together. I expressed I didn’t feel safe in the neighborhood at one set of apartments and he said “well I won’t be outside”.
He was very selfish. 
We broke up a bunch more then got back together after he came to one of my ultrasounds. Finally broke up for the final time. 
All I wanted was for him to try. I wanted him to be more of a man, take more initiative to make things work instead of just letting me go so easily. He truly made me feel like he didn’t give a damn about me or my safety. He was 32 and a virgin. He never had sex before or a girlfriend. He had issues staying hard and thought his issues stemmed from his childhood. 
His father murdered his mother and step mom.
Even though me and him broke up, I secretly was hoping he would try to change or work on himself. Or that we could at least be friends and raise the baby right together. 
We had a lawyer together and sat down and made a parenting plan.
3 weeks later he gets into another relationship with a woman. He never ask how my pregnancy is going. I had to get upset and argue with him about why he seemed so uninterested in the pregnancy. He acted like it was an issue to buy baby supplies knowing I was only 18 and a student. 
Instead he could go over to his 37 year old girlfriends house and give her money for loans and spend time with her child. He knew this woman 3 weeks, and wanted to introduce her to me. 
I was 6 months pregnant, in constant pain, and he wanted me to meet a woman he has known less than a month. I was a floored.
She helps him pick a custody lawyer and I get severed with a battle that costs my grandparents $14,000.
He involved her in my pregnancy. Let her listen in on our phone calls. He even tried asking to be in the delivery room and I was on the news. Then he tried suing for the baby to take his last name even though we were never married and I was the primary custodian. I was on the news again. 
I did some research on his girlfriend to find out she is a radical atheist. She says people who believe in Gods are shit and deserve to die. She is off the wall politically crazy, and every word out of her mouth was profanity. She had a history of drug use and prison time. The local police department said she was a troublemaker. 
I expressed all this to him and he had no problem with it aside from her cussing. I cried and cried for him to please drop the attorneys and just try to get a long for our child’s sake. I couldn’t believe he wanted to expose our child to something like that. 
He ends up breaking up with her the month our son is born. The judge put her in a parenting plan that said she is to never be around our child. 
Fast forward a few months and the issues still didn’t stop. He wanted overnights at 3 months even though I was breastfeeding. He wanted people I never met around our newborn. 
I didn’t trust his judgment anyways after the woman he tried to bring into our child’s life. I started coming over having sex with him. I wanted to get back together with him to make things cordial enough for our son. That led to me falling deeply in love with him. Getting married. And now, I’m pregnant again. I have already scheduled an appointment for an abortion. 

I have suffered from panic attacks since I was 12 years old. I had a fear of big open places. Once I left whatever was triggering me, my panic went away. My anxiety has gotten significantly worse. Starting in October I have had to call an ambulance out multiple times. My attacks get so bad I cry, hyperventilate, I get dizzy, my heart rate goes up. I feel like I will die. 
Yesterday it was so bad, I had to take half a Xanax. It calmed me down immediately. My main symptoms now are more physiological. I have been very depressed, my whole day is spent avoiding a panic attack or thinking about one. For a while I was scared to even leave my house. I feel “unreal” at times or like I’m going to lose my mind and go crazy. My fear is ending up in a physh ward or completely being unstable. I know logically this isn’t going to happen because if I’m that scared of it happening, it’s not going to happen. I worry obsessively over my health. Constantly monitoring blood pressure and sugar levels. I can’t live like this anymore. I think something is medically wrong until I realize.. if something was wrong, the Xanax wouldn’t have worked. It is anxiety. And obviously pregnancy hormones. There’s no way I could’ve kept this child. 

My question is, is me focusing on the issue of him being with another woman and putting me through that a part of my OCD and obsessive thought process, or is it a warning I should leave him? I love my husband with all of my heart. He has apologized many times, and said he would never do that to me again. That he knew it was so wrong. We’ve been doing better. The thought of leaving him makes me physically sick because he does help me through my panic attacks so much... but yet I wonder if he is the reason I’m having them. 

I think about this constantly and the entire situation makes me sick.. and it was 2 years ago. This has been going on since September. I am wondering if I should leave him, or try to make this work?",10Feb2020,1

186,"This is mostly based online because, that's where most my life lays.

I'm not sure how to construct this, so i apologise if this turns out to be bad or a waste of your time, i just needed somewhere secure to expel this out.

(excuse my use of grammar and too much commas)

I recently took a down turn to the worst, again mental health - wise. It always seems like i have something wrong with me and i rarely ever address it towards people purposely, even when they've offered to support me through such things.

The times i do say something, it's like i screamed into styrofoam. I don't know if they do take courtesy to read what i have given them or if i word things poorly and expect them to instantly understand and know what to do.

But i don't normally get a response, it will be a period of time after or instantly, while they've been online and they'll talk to me about their problems or something completely derived from the topic. I'm not sure how i should take that, if i should feel offended, sad or just let it go. I just brush it off, thinking maybe they are not able to understand or aren't in the right mindset to respond or help properly. it also makes me second guess if i constructed what i said properly for their understanding.

i have always been there for them, no matter what they've been through, real or not. It is obvious to my own views that these people, only use me for their gain of benefit, for help, sympathy or attention.

i have distanced myself from alot of the individuals which i helped, maturing and learning overtime with research into mental health for their issues, attention seeking and sadfishing. I realised how often i was just being used for their self gain.

I don't know how many really suffered from such problems of mental health or if it was fabricated, but it really openned my eyes to how vile some can be once you don't give them what they wanted.

Now, I. I have been through the whole child trauma horror of it all and mostly dealt with my developed issues and mental health issues professionally, always kept it between my family, selectively close friends and myself. 

Now, I'm on Reddit and unlikely any of you will have any idea on who i am, so i can release the ridiculous list of problems here. Now it is your choice if you define me by these diagnosis's or not, but I'd rather you'd just see me as an everyday human being.

Now i normally i just addressed the one diagnosis which is prominent in myself as a character to people because it concludes to hold a whole package so others can understand without listing in a way. I am professionally diagnosed with, paranoia schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, generalised anxiety, dsm-5 or as you would better know it as agoraphobia, dilusional disorder and last but not least, an eating disorder.

these are my everyday battles which I'm accustome to, so no need for sympathy on that end.

sometimes, i just need the comfort of a friend to help and understand me, if they can.

i have frankly lost (been blocked out of nowhere) by a good friend which i made over a few months, very lovely person, we shared and vented to each other, helping each other when needed. But that disappeared very quickly, now I've assumed it was due to a situation which i had no control over, which i will address very bleakly though.

there was a situation with my friend and their girlfriend, somehow me being friends threatend their relationship and now I'm cut out for just being there but not instigating anything or doing anything. 

Which this has now led to me being very lonely, due to us having similar timezones, we'd chat to keep each other company, due to everyone else being away or sleeping, timezones am i right? haha.

anyways, we both made it clear from the start to end, to be on terms on friendship and nothing more and that is what it was. This is one of the situations that hit me in face and I'm now trying to control some symptoms before it explodes upon me.

now, my close friends are nice, but they have lives. Which i respect and understand, so i don't blame them for not always being online. I know some of them have worse situations than me and are trying to get through them.

I have one close friend, who always talks about her issues infront of me and i do my best to help her. She always, says “she must the most unluckiest person.”, due to her situation, which again i don't blame her for thinking that way.

But it's starting to ware away at me, everything. She'll be gone in a month, my friends have mostly abandoned being online or spend their time meaningfully with others.

I get very bad bursts of lows, loneliness and just sadness. They've been invading my brain recently.

I was prescribed as people nickname it “Happy Pills” or “antidepressants”. Which of course work for a certain amount of time, but the rush of endorphins and happiness feels fake, falsified to hide what's really going on.

I'm like a pyramid, when one symptom starts progressively getting worse due to circumstantial events, they all start progressively getting worse.

Now I'm seeking professional help throughout with this. But I'm scared, it will all just crash, that my hard work of being at a semi-stable place will have gone.

I'm scared that my friends won't care, if i need to go or something happens.

I'm very much alone in this place of mines.

196,"Or something similar, anyway. I've recently started therapy and have also been prescribed medication for an anxious disorder. I've been a very anxious person all my life and have recently learned I've been having ""anxiety attacks"" (sorry of it's not the proper term; english is my second language) and I didn't know I was having them because I didn't know what they were. I thought everyone just basically sat staring at the wall and have their brains go off into catastrophic scenarios while simultaneously wondering if they had heart problems for hours on end because I do this. I've been doing it so much for so long it was just normal, and realizing not everyone goes through that was like finding out some people stand up to wipe their ass instead of staying seated on the toilet. And someone in my life realized I was going through this problem, which is invisible to most, and wanted me to know that I can live without this. So I decided to finally seek treatment, at almost 30 years old.

This anxiety has been present in a lot of aspects of my life, and since I've started therapy and medication, I've been able to see more objectively just how stunted I am. I'm afraid of cars, so I don't drive, will avoid getting into a car at all, if I can, and get super nervous crossing the street. I thought it was generalized anxiety, but really, I just remember what it was like to be in a car with my father.
I'm an opinionated person and I stand my ground, but when a man raises his voice I get so shaken up. If an older man is yelling, I sometimes just lose my shit and cry, even if he's not yelling at me. Even so little as a disapproving glance can make me feel as though I'm being scolded and will spiral into self doubt for days on end, even if my pride keeps telling me I don't give a crap what anyone thinks.
I've never studied and instead dropped out of high school, because no matter what I did, it was gonna be worthless anyway. That little voice in my head would say ""what, you think you're so smart? You think you can change the world, don't you? Well aren't you fucking special?"" And I'm coming to terms with the fact that that is my father's voice. I haven't spoken to the man in 15 years, but I'm still talking with him, in my head, every damn day of my life.
Coming to terms with all of this makes me so angry. I'm properly insulted that this man would still have so much power over me even after cutting him out of my life for what has literally been half my life. Insulted and ashamed of somehow still being a scolded child.

I guess if I'm posting today, it's because he sent me a Facebook friend request the other day. I'm afraid of him, and it's like he poked my delicate little bubble. I don't even know if I have anything to say to him. What would I tell him? You ruined my life? That would give him too much power, and he'd love that. Your grandchildren will never know your name? Why would I say anything to him if it's just to spew hatred? I'm not like him, I don't seek to hurt.

I guess I just needed to scream into the wind a bit. Thank you to anyone who read this. And if anyone is going through something similar, just know that it may be a long road to recovery, but I firmly believe we can heal these scars so long as we just keep trying.",10Feb2020,2

Anyways, here's the deal.

A month ago I discovered that my ex girlfriend is dating one of my best friends. Long story short, my whole life fell apart; I actually thought about suicide.

But, I eventually got over it and thought I was feeling better. Sure, I was restless: couldn't sleep, couldn't come out of bed if I did eventually fall asleep. But as days went by, and with some kind of medication, my overall morale got back to its usual level... mostly.

Until, two weeks ago, nightmares started to show up to wake me in the middle of the night. At first I thought it was just because I was thirsty; in fact, I don't actually remember most of my first nightmares. But now, they have become more vivid, long and terrifying. 

Yesterday I dreamt of reliving that painful moment again but with also my friends fighting against me. I woke up sweaty, with my heart racing and with a really strong nausea.

Is there something I can do to stop this? It's beginning to take it's toll on me.

201,"I ask because Ive been reading a lot on reddit about dating &amp; attraction lately. A lot of men keep telling me that most women are able to be aroused by ugly men so long as those men say &amp; do the right things. I am not this way though. I just like beauty. My question is: is this how most women are?

Ive been trying to talk about this on various subreddits and getting banned.

The first subreddit I tried talking about my love of beauty on was r/cuckoldpsychology and got banned.

Then I tried posting about it on r/purplepilldebate and alao got banned.

When asked why I was banned they cited a comment of mine where I'm talking about good looks being a key component to attraction. I got banned for it then muted when trying to talk about it with mods. Do mods hate female sexuality??? Here's my conversation with the mods, as well as the comment that I made: [https://m.imgur.com/8SLxF6f](https://m.imgur.com/8SLxF6f)

203,"As a veteran, I have a wide range of services for mental health and support. I even have a case manager who helps me navigate the VA, and gets me in contact with the right people. Recently, I've been recommended a peer support specialist and it has been great. Basically, in order to be a peer support specialist in the VA you have to 
1) be a veteran
2)have a disability rating of at least 70%
3) Have gone through various therapy programs, groups, and classes through the VA
4) have become stable and be willing to share how you have overcome your disability and what coping methods work for you.

It is excellent because, instead of working solely with a therapist who may only use book knowledge, a peer support specialist has first hand experience in the process of recovery.

It is such a great resource and program, but I was wondering how civilians may get the same help. I know that our local NAMI can sometimes introduce us to social workers and case managers. Those people can then help us find community resources like that. However, when I was trying to help a friend find peer support in his state, it seemed that the only ones available pertained to addiction. Basically, they are people who overcame addiction and now help others do the same and help them find treatment. While that is excellent, he doesn't have a problem with substance abuse. Instead, he would like something similar to what I have. Someone who has mental illness but has gone through the recovery and healing needed to become stable. A person with first hand experience who can offer support and guidance. 

Does anyone have any information on how/where to find that, or who he can talk to?",10Feb2020,1

206," I dont know if this is the right place for it but I need to get it out. I need to vent or I'm going to go crazy. 

I (28f) was diagnosed ADHD four months ago and prescribed Dex. I took it and it made me feel sick. So my psychiatrist said it means I don't have ADHD. He didnt even discuss dosages with me, just said because half on one tablet didnt work for three days then the diagnosis was a reneg. I know he's wrong. So he prescribed me ritalin. And I took it for one day and felt sick. I have massive anxiety and I honestly believe it's just exacerbating my anxiety, not that I dont have ADHD. I am so mad at my psychiatrist for so many reasons. If you weren't sure, why give me written reports confirming my diagnosis? If you arent going to discuss dosages and long term plans with me, why prescribe me these drugs?

So I took 5 steps back, found a different ADHD specialist and put the drugs away. Starting from scratch.

I have been a daily heavy pot smoker for 13 years. It is the only thing that makes me feel normal. I dont get stoned as much as I get focused. Life is easier, im not angry at everything and reacting on emotion. Im not pacing the hallways every day because I dont know how to channel my energy. And so my new psych told me to quit. To take that away so we can see my mental health issues for what they are and to stop masking with weed.

And all I can say is this must be what hell feels like. It's been two weeks clean and sober and life is miserable. I can't focus, I can't sleep, my emotions are at the surface all the time, I'm amped at everything, Im always tired, Im always angry. Im always bored but theres nothing I want to do. And if this is what life is going to be like for me then fuck it. Fuck the old psych for trying to take the ADHD away from me. I know it's real and he did nothing but fuck with my head. And fuck the new psych for minimising what is my only coping technique and taking that away from me. Fuck it all. Lifes fucked.

# Feeling Betrayed/Obsession

I'm a freshman in a KY, USA college located in my hometown.  This is my second semester, and out of all the years I've struggled with depression, this has been my worst year; hands down.  On the first Friday of last semester, August 20th, my best friend/girlfriend left me.  We'll call her R.

R was my best friend since my sophomore year in high school. She was a freshman at the time, and since I met her I was completely smitten.  I was awkward, definitely not confident, and overly invested.  When I saw a girl I liked, I became completely obsessive and it drove most of them away even if they had initial interest.  We became best friends, like brother and sister, until the second semester of my senior year. We both had gotten out of relationships and decided we'd date. For all the years we were just friends, my mom hated her, so we kept things on the down-low. I didn't have a car and couldn't see her unless I would go behind my mother's back, or in the following case, a special condition.  I asked her out on my 18th birthday (lol) Jan 14th. We dated for 7-ish months, and everything seemed fine until we got back from a trip to Missouri for a week during this past summer.  Everything was happy in the moment, but immediately when we got back I could tell her entire demeanor changed.  We would fight almost daily, she would barely talk, and always acted bitter towards me.  I've been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety since I was a sophomore, and this didn't help.  We kept bringing each other down and down until the late night of August 20th, when she left.  She wouldn't tell me why or give me any sort of closure.  We had a mutual best friend, N, who at the time told me she had likely cheated on me with N's ex.  I found out later that R spent every night of the Summer with N's ex, and this broke me because it's the only closure I can still come to having not talked to R since.  Feeling completely betrayed, my confidence hit an all time low, I would have regular mood swings from crying and screaming, to yelling and hitting floors.  This was the only girl I could ever say I truly loved, and I dedicated my high school career to this girl. To this day, I still have nightmares about her, and honestly can't go a day without her popping in my head for some reason or another.  When this happens, it totally wrecks my state of mind, even on the best days.

On September 24th I got into a relationship with a student on campus who I'll call K.  I have this habit of falling for girls as soon as I meet one I like, and oh GOD is that something awful.  Through the 3-ish months we dated, I was extremely happy and on the top of my game. However, on November 20th I almost left her for attempting to cyber stalk R. I let it go, until Jan 14th (19th birthday).  We were laying in bed going through my Snapchat memories and there were unmentionable pictures which she received from me a few days prior. Apparently she had not recognized them, but said nothing.  She proceeded to go to her friend's house that night and vent about it, apparently assuming I had been cheating.  I hadn't. She met with me the next day to accuse me, which I explained my reasoning for keeping the pictures.  It wasn't until I realized she had already made backup plans for when she was going to leave me that I felt I needed to do something. On Jan 16th, I left her because:

1. My mother didn't like her due to her weight.
2. She had severe trust issues that we've tried working through and I couldn't remedy.

Now I've been single, but I can't stand being alone.  One thing I failed to mention is that when R left me, I had no-one to go to.  I'm the guy that always has to start conversations if I want anyone to talk to me, which leads me to believe I have greater issues. I went into a frenzy trying to make friends and meet people, which led to further self-destruction.  Now, I still don't have anyone in college.  Every time I try talking to a Tinder match, they hardly reciprocate communication as if they really just don't care to talk.  I don't have any real *guy friends* either, as none reciprocate communication.

The thing that confuses me is that I'm completely nonjudgmental about everything.  I care about listening to people, because I've never had that.  In college, I just feel so utterly alone.

Could it just be that I feel like something's wrong with me because I've never had a father, or because my mother is the most judgmental, controlling woman I've ever met? I have a yearning to meet the right people that won't likely ever come, and it eats me from the inside-out.  I don't know how to manage it all.
