0,"Hi, so I'm generally a very caring guy (towards my gf, parents, friends) but when I see a kitten, I feel an urge to... torture it. It's not like this when I see a puppy or other small animals but with kittens I just feel a desire to hurt/kill it. I thought it's some sort of a instinct towards predators (as in in the past if you were lucky to find the helpless offspring of a predator you kill it). I also can't tell if it's the cuteness or the helplessness that is provoking it. Really weird. I believe sound also aggravates it - I watched a youtube video of this french bulldog that wouldn't shut up and I just felt like I wanted to punch it (although that might have been because the dog was annoying).

What the hell is wrong with me?",26Apr2020,1

2,"I don't really know if this fits on this sub, but here I go. 

To summarize things a bit, by saying ""I don't care"", I mean that I don't have any emotional attachment to things. I don't feel Sadness, Happiness, Love, Hate, or any emotion at all. I know inconvenience/convenience or frustration/disappointment, but it stops there. I know what to do to be liked by people, so I never have been actually alone in my life. But as soon as some distance appears between me and someone, no matter how good friends we were, or even if it is family, we never talk ever again. I have had girlfriends (didn't mention I'm a 20M), and I stayed for a long time in the relationships (around two years each). But it was because THEY came to me and because they had psychological issues that I was there to soothe. Every time my SO issues got better, they eventually realized that I was just a husk and that I didn't actually care about the relationship.

Even with family, I basically never text or call them if I'm away, sometimes in the span of months. I'm known in my family and circle of friends as ""the one that never answers"" and I play it like I don't see their calls and texts, but I just don't answer because I'm doing something else and I see responding as a waste of time.

Now If you read this far you might think that I'm a narcissist who only cares about himself and nothing else. But the fact is I don't care about myself either. I've been living alone for a while when I entered college, and I spent around 6 months in my appartment, eating when I was hungry and sleeping when I was sleepy. I was basically playing on my computer/watching netflix while occasionally smoking pot, and got out when I needed food or smokes. I stopped seeing friends and family.

My family thinks I've been through depression because I lost a lot of weight (around 20 Kg), But I know it was just because staying home was more convenient for me, and because I had no interest in going to college, even though the content of the diploma interested me alot. I just prefered to live like that, away from people I can't bond with and inside my lonely (but not sad) bubble. I am now out of that situation and back on track, but I secretly regret it every day because I see it as freedom.

I know I shouldn't be and feel like that, and I'm scared because everyone in my life is starting to realize that I don't care, and I don't even know what to say to contradict this idea. I have never felt this much like there is something really wrong with me, and at this point I need advice. Do I have some kind of mental illness ? Do I just need to learn how to feel ? Am I just a GIGANTIC asshole who only cares about what makes him thrilled on the moment ? I'm lost.

P.S : Thanks for coming to my TEDtalk.",26Apr2020,1
3,"""I found out recently that my girlfriend had been having sexualized dreams about a good freind of mine, which i'm not opposed too, I'd prefer if it didn't happen but dreams arent controlable. Then I realized she had been looking at pictures of him quite often, it thought nothing of it at first but then she told me about the fantasies and thought she might be masturbating to him which is a completely diffrent scenario. Masturbating is controlable and there are plenty of things she can do it to besides clothed pictures of him like porn or me. I asked her if she had been and she couldn't give me and answer which leads me to believe she has and doesn't want to tell me. I know if i was having fantasies about her friends or masturbating to them she would've dumped me and that makes it worse. I'm curious about other peoples oppinions on the matter, please weigh in.""

I posted that on r/relationship_advice I'm still not sure how to feel she doesn't seem to be very concerned about how this has made me felt, I just keep looking back at how she's talked about him before in what she called ""jokes"", swooning over him and such. I'm not concerned about her cheating, I just feel like I'm not good enough physically for her anymore, and I'm jealous I'm not who she dreams of. She said these dreams are often and It's proceeded by me cheating on her with someone in the dream usually. I didn't really care about the dreams too much I was very understanding and talked to her about it because she said she would like them to stop. But then again i feel like shes bringing them on if she is masturbating, which is the only reason I can think of for her continually looking at my friends pictures. I thought i was fine with it and then it just kept popping back into my memory and I tried pressuring her to talk about whether she did it again, whether or not she was still attracted to me, whether I was more attractive to her than him. She said it would be rude to decide who's more attractive to her but she has said I'm hotter than dudes she knows before and had attractions too. As i said i the roles were reversed honestly I know she would at the very least upset, but more than likely she would break up with me, the double standard is one of the worst parts(I asked her how she would feel in my shoes and she said angry). She's now mad at me for continuing to talk about it and I still feel insecure and just overall like shit, I can't stop shaking and I've lost most of my motivation to do anything.",26Apr2020,1

5,"Male, 22. I had several occasions of anxiety and depression since, as far as I could remember, when I was 15. Lately, I experienced insomnia and couldn't function properly the next day. I'd sometimes vent out to my parents about how I feel, though not always direct, I assume they know I meant depressive mood or something. I'm always told that I lack a strong relationship with God. In the most extreme case, I directly told them I might want to kill myself. They told me it is the works of the devil. They prayed for me last time  in hopes that my insomnia would go away, which coincidentally did because I intentionally woke up earlier to drain myself. I was never asked what I really feel. It always seem to be redirected with a spiritual resolution, that it's all going to be fine with the help of God. I'm not an atheist, by the way. I identify myself as a Christian. But why is it I have to be accused as someone who probably needs more God in his life? Can't I be a depressed Christian? Is it against the Bible to feel sad? What I'm getting from my parents is that they want to show me that Christianity is just all happiness, and if you're sad you just need God, and it seems that I don't have to vent it out and I'll just have to talk to God.

I mean, I am depressed but I can't tell her that, lol.

She keeps asking if I'm okay and stuff and I tell her I'm fine even though I'm really not cause I can't get myself to tell her the truth.

She also get angry or something with me sometimes because I don't do anything all day and all that and she says I need to get out of bed or I need to do something or else I'll get depressed which I think is really fucking stupid but whatever, lmao.

I don't really know what to do rn tbh cause I know I can't get myself to tell her I'm not okay but also I want her to know cause I want (/need) help.",26Apr2020,1
7,Your own Self-realization is the greatest service you can render the world. No one succeeds without effort... Those who succeed owe their success to perseverance. The degree of freedom from unwanted thoughts and the degree of concentration on a single thought are the measures to gauge spiritual progress.,26Apr2020,1
8,"That is what my day feels like, everyday.  And I dont mean that as a simile or metaphore or other comparison that just means ""my life is boring"".  It is indeed very boring, I have no friends or hobbies really and I'm always depressed and lazy, but I also make myself completely miserable because my brain will not just shut the fuck up for a little bit.

If it is possible for a person to have ""negative patience"" I am one of them.  Whenever a thought pops in my head, or some kind of deadline/start time, I just get so incredibly anxious about it that it's impossible to find enjoyment in doing something else.  Itll be 10AM on a Saturday that I work at 245PM and I've already written the morning and afternoon off because I've gotta prepare for work.... prepare for work? It takes me like 45 seconds to get ready for work.  Why cant I just relax and enjoy my saturday morning for a bit?

I know that I am at least reasonably intelligent.  If only because of my obsessive topic reading when something sparks my interest.  But someone can give me a project that, without anxiety, I would be able to perform with no issue, but I just instantly feel overwhelmed thinking about how it needs to be done and I panic.


What is this?  I always thought it was major anxiety and depression.  I've started taking an antidepressant and my mindset is actually way better, and that feels amazing... but these other feelings have not changed one bit.  I'm more confident than I've ever been in my life right now, it feels so weird, yet I still have these panics/anxieties/fleeting mind.  It's almost made me wonder if maybe I have some kind of ADD.  I imagine anxiety and ADD coexist on some level (??).",26Apr2020,1
9,"I had a few rather good conversation and time spent with friends and family today, but as I came to my room to go to bed, the same thing that hits me regularly hit me again. I’m not worth the time people have taken for me. I’m not really something people should waste time on. I genuinely believe that I’m a subpar person. I’m lower than most and don’t deserve the affection that I may receive. I can say, honestly, that, in my own mind, I’m absolutely worthless. I don’t have a single redeeming quality about myself.

I know that when I’m in my 30s or 40s she will eventually pass and every time I’m with her I think of that but I just want to have fun. When I’m with my dad I feel bad for not giving him as much credit because he tries hard to help me.

The isolation of these woods are killing me more everyday and I have never felt more alone, the nearest town is where I was abused. After narrowly avoiding killing myself yesterday I've decided to leave. I was going to spend a week with my friend in Fresno as a previous plan and I've decided to just never take the plane back, I know it's dumb and very rash but from my perspective I'm either going to die trying to be happy or die in this depressive hole doing nothing about it.

12,"I told my parents that I want to be happy and find a simple job by the mountains after I graduate graduate school for a bit. They think that’d be a waste even though it would only be temporary.

I just don’t get why they don’t see the value in happiness even when you don’t have a solid career yet. I feel like they don’t understand the value of the long journey before a solid career. Why does it have to be a draining, long, and straight path to get to where you’re going? Can’t you stop and smell the flowers every once and a while?

14,"I’ve been depressed and had anxiety since I was about 14. I don’t want to self-diagnose but if I had to guess I’d say that I probably have borderline personality disorder  as the symptoms resonate with how I’ve always felt. 

I didn’t really understand that the way I think and how my brain works isn’t normal until I was about 17. By that point I was a year away from going to college so I just thought I’d wait it out until then and hoped that things would change. They didn’t. I’m now 23 and it’s killing me that I’ve wasted and am still wasting what are meant to be some of the prime years of my life. 

The closest I’ve ever come to talking about it with anyone was about 3 months after I moved back to living at home after graduating college. I was sitting on the edge of my bed at one of my lowest points. I wasn’t in a good place at all as I spent a lot of my final year at college smoking weed to try and numb how I was feeling and then stopped completely when I moved home and so my brain chemistry was all over the place. Me and my sister had just had an argument and so my mom came into to talk to me about it. I explained my point of view to my mom and I thought she was actually listening to what I had to say. I almost felt comfortable enough to tell her I need help for my mental health.  Before I could she interrupted me and basically sided with my sister and overlooked everything I had to say as if it had gone into one ear and out the other, not even acknowledging what I’d said so I didn’t say anything else. 

Since then my family has been through a lot. My sister lost her best friend and my mum and dad have been struggling to deal with the death and dementia of my grandparents. Throughout this time I haven’t wanted to add to what they have to worry about so I’ve just been dying inside silently in the background. 

Recently things have been getting better for my family in terms of getting over grief and being generally happier. This is why I don’t want them to know I’ve been feeling this way for so long because they’d be devastated and worry about me. Sometimes they can see something isn’t right and ask me what’s wrong but I just tell them I’m tired because I just can’t bring myself to say how I’m really feeling. 

I don’t know if anyone will read all of this but I just don’t know what to do. I’ve been suffering in silence for so long and I just don’t see a way out without hurting the people around me.",26Apr2020,1
15,"Hey, I don’t know how to start this off properly but I’m 14 f and I live with my mom, dad and little brother. 
My dad drinks alcohol every day, I couldn’t find the EXACT amount of alcohol you have to drink in order to make you an alcoholic but I don’t know exactly how much he drinks everyday because it just varies. 
My dad DOES have an alcohol problem. I’ve been aware of it for 5-6 years now, but I recently found an old picture that I REMEMBER drawing of my dad, laying on the sofa drinking wine. I remember using him as a reference to draw it so it IS him, so it’s probably been ingrained in my head for a while now and I think I was 4 when I drew this picture. 
I thought that my dad was this funny guy, who liked drinking wine sometimes. But around 4-5 years ago that’s when I was aware of it becoming a problem, however I didn’t know it was only going to blossom into something evil.
When my dad is drunk, he’s not physically abusive to PEOPLE, but he does have a tendency to occasionally break/ damage things when he’s in an intoxicated enough state. I’d just like to mention that.
So, the first time I remember being actually distressed because of his drinking problem was one night, when I heard my parents shouting. My dad was obviously drunk and came into my room at about 1am and I don’t remember much about it now, just the main things that happened which was him punching my lightswitch, it was plastic so it broke into pieces and I could hear it so crisply and I was deeply disturbed and terrified at such a minor thing. I remember crying and feeling intensely scared because I had never seen him break anything before. Then they argued for a bit more and I can’t remember what happened.
Another time, he actually managed to punch a hole in the wall that my mom somehow managed to fix; at first he told me and my brother he “was walking up the stairs with a spoon and slipped”, making the spoon go through the wall which I obviously didn’t believe.
There are many times where similar stuff has happened, at the time I thought “this isn’t normal”. But now- I’m used to it, so used to it that I just laugh it off and I don’t know if that’s normal anymore.
Another time this has happened, which will stay with me forever, was IN PUBLIC when we went on holiday about 3 years ago now. It started off with him buying bottles of vodka at the airport, and I could see he was getting niggly about what he wanted and he tried to hide his purchase from me and my brother but we saw him; he knew anyway. This wasn’t the big part, though. When we were actually on the plane, he had managed to drink enough wine/ cider(I do what it was) to make himself so drunk that he was in his aggressive violent mode. I didn’t think much of it, but then I could hear my brother (who was about 8-9 at the time) telling him to “stop it”. He was referring to my dad telling him to “man up and not be a p*ssy”. He then started crying, as my dad was raising his voice which attracted attention to us. While this happened, my mom was at the toilet. Then my dad punched the table (you know those tables you can fold in and out on airplanes). He punched it a few times and then I started crying, because it shocked me to see him behaving like this in public. This wasn’t my dad, how could it be? I was also crying because although I was 10-11, it was humiliating to see my drunken dad behave like this IN PUBLIC. My mom was trying to tell him to stop but it did no use, drunk people tend to lose theirs senses from what I’ve gathered over the years. At this point people were shaking their heads and whispering to one another. I couldn’t believe it.
So then the flight attendant comes over, and my dad sees this as an opportunity to GET MORE ALCOHOL and the flight attendant politely tells him she couldn’t do that, due to his severely violent and intoxicated state, and to my mom’s begging request. He tries a bunch more times, until he gives in and falls asleep. 
Then when we’re at the airport to get another flight, we have to wait 13 hours and we should sleep. My dad, still drunk, TELLS MY MOM HE’S GOING TO THE BAR AND TO “MEET UP” IN A FEW HOURS. He tries walking away but my mom follows him and is mad at him. This goes on a bit more until we find somewhere to sit. Instead of sleeping in a chair like some of the other people at the airport, THIS MAN TAKES MY BROTHER’S BACKPACK, GOES UNDER A TALL PLANT, PUTS THE BAG ON THE FLOOR AND SLEEPS ON THE GROUND AND USES THE BAG LIKE A PILLOW. He does this for hours and it looks so ridiculous and you could HEAR HIM SNORING SO SO LOUDLY. We’re a biracial family so it didn’t look like we were related to him, so a lot of people probably assumed he was homeless or something. 
He got drunk a lot when we actually got to our destination, but after we met up with my auntie and my grandma my mom and dad would go out late at night and leave us with them so we didn’t know what exactly went on.
Now, that was about 3 years ago and it’s only getting worse. Whenever me or my brother try to talk to him about it, he gets mad and says we are being “disrespectful” to him. My house smells like alcohol and I’d be embarrassed to invite friends over. You can smell it off HIM. I had a sleepover 2 years ago and was worried that he’d cause trouble and I almost called it off because I worried so much about it.
He drinks every single day up to the point where he either p*sses off my mom, (he talks a lot of verbal diarrhoea when he’s drunk) or has an argument and ends up becoming too drunk and just passes out on his bed. I don’t know if he’s an alcoholic, because he claims he’s not. He says “alcoholics drink for breakfast, lunch and dinner” but a lot of the time he hardly eats dinner so he can fill up on the booze. He claims it’s not his fault either because my grandpa also has a drinking problem (which I’m NOT getting into because that would take me all night) but he seems to be using that as an excuse.
Everyone is aware of it in my family. He doesn’t hesitate to hide it even when my 7yo cousin comes to stay, and my grandma always tells my mom that he needs to get help. He drinks EVERY SINGKE NIGHT, and sometimes through the day too. My mom can’t drive so he takes her to work, even when he knows he has to do this he still manages to slip in a few bottles the night before. He’s unemployed by the way.

I don’t know if I’m being dramatic about this, but stuff like this has happened so much that I’ve become used to it. I don’t let it affect me anymore because I don’t want to be seen as a p*ssy. This lifestyle isn’t normal but it’s so ingrained in my head now that I don’t cry about it anymore, and I see it as normal. I don’t want to make my issues seem massive, and I HATE people who self diagnose but I’m suspecting I have anxiety or depression or something because whenever he acts like this I become worried, and now I find daily interaction difficult because I feel like all of my friends hate me and I’m worried about everything and I get scared easily when people jump up at me etc. I don’t know if this whole experience is what’s causing me to feel this way, and I’ve gone for years not telling a soul and I’ve never gotten it checked or anything. These problems I’ve been facing have recently become really overwhelming, to the point where I felt so bad I tried to overdose (it failed miserably). 
I remember this time my geography teacher shouted really loud at this boy in my class, and it reminded me of my dad screaming and I honestly felt really scared in that class, it was like it brought me back/ reminded me of those experiences. It was scarily uncanny. I despise alcohol, I hate talking about it, I ha the looking at it and I’ve decided I’m never going to drink because of what this has done to me. Again, I don’t know if I’m dramatising this but sometimes I wonder if i would still feel so bad, worried, anxious and alone if things were different and my dad wasn’t a drinker. 
I just want my dad back and a normal life without feeling this way, with a bad metal health.
If anyone actually reads this, thank you, and back to the original question- do you think my dad is an alcoholic or just extremely addicted to alcohol?",26Apr2020,1
16,"I’m a 26(M), i recently moved back in with my adoptive mother and I feel like a complete failure. My adoptive parents have been separated for a few years now. I grew up the youngest of 9 children (mother eventuality lost custody of all 9 we were never all under the same roof) most of which I didn’t meet till much older in my teens but my two full blood siblings went through a lot with me, we were even abandoned in Honduras for a year and when we came back to the United States when I was about 4 my mother lost custody of us, I would eventually go back with her for a few months but my life with her was very short. I lived in 10 different homes by the age of 9 was molested in one and abused in others. When I was nine tho my brother got separated from me and my sister because of disciplinary issues at a foster home. And she pretty much had the same fate. I on the other hand was the only one of 9 to be adopted. And grew up away from them from time to time tho they visited me in my open adoption or I visited them. I ended up developing an out of control drug habit went to multiple rehabs and even did 22 months incarceration and a state mandated DOC rehab/behavioral modification at 21years old. Fast forward to now I am dealing with a lot of depression, shame, mood swings the works. I’m a well rounded guy on the outside but I’ve suppressed so much for years I literally didn’t talk about the molestation till I was 23 and never have about plenty of other crap. Last year I tried to get anxiety medication from a physician and was given some sort of Prozac. I tried it for like a week never met up with a therapist or whoever he recommended. Now I’m going through cycles of sever depression and anxiety. I’ll get a job interview and flake my first day out of fear I guess. I’m not sure where to go from here I have cycles of extreme production then very low Low’s. I feel a lot of depression and shame of what I put my family through and if I’m anything like my bio mom I have a slew of issues. I think I need therapy I’m hesitant on taking medications but something needs to change.

21,"At this point, my life is pathetic. Today I’ve had one of the few conversations I’ve had in quite a long time. Why? Because my loneliness has reached the point where I do certain things simply for the attention. In this case, I uploaded a story about my loneliness just so I would get noticed, and hopefully messaged by, a random account I followed years ago. The person in question reached out, and we messaged back and forth. It was nice. Nonetheless, that is what my life is now. Similarly, a few months ago, I wrote online about having no friends, hoping someone would invite me out - and they did! I find myself as friendless as ever though, with a cousin of mine (who I also reached out...) being one of my closest friends, despite her never checking in with me. 

Oh right... and don’t even get me started on my romantic life. My what-now? As if. Only in my most far fetched dreams. Something that’ll likely never happen. Why would it? Who would want to be in a relationship with me? I keep trying, as well as failing. There just seems to be no hope.

No hope in either of the two arenas. That’s essentially what it is. Just a nonstop battle, but a battle that a skinny little guy like me stand no chance of winning. No siree, the closest would be random people online, and even they seem to disappear in no time. What is the purpose of this? 24 years and I’m getting weaker. Not as a result of my advancing age, but the steady decline of any hope which remained from my childhood years. Would I not save myself a ton of pain by committing the sinful act of taking my own life? For it seems this life contains nothing but torture. The few traces of joy I experience, are nothing but short-lived and minuscule - things most people take for granted. “Oh my god, this person I don’t know just wrote me” etc. Most of the time (for several years now!!), I feel either joyless and completely neutral, or I feel overcome with sadness. I’m 24 now, and so far, my 20’s have been almost entirely without any joy whatsoever. What is the point...",26Apr2020,1

I guess maybe i’m in denial or something but I still feel that my problems aren’t significant enough and that the therapist will just think i’m weak for coming (even though i know they won’t). While I know that I cannot get a concerned diagnosis on reddit I guess I just want some reassurance that i’m not just crazy or something. While all of this stuff is true I still feel like i’m overplaying it or something.



So I don’t know for sure if I have an eating disorder but I’m getting more self concise of my weight. I don’t know what to call it but I want to gain weight but cannot. All my life I have been considerably underweight and my doctor told me to take Boost which I have been for the past 6 years but has never said anything else about it. I have always been a very picky eater and usually won’t eat if it’s something I don’t like. However, recently I have been eating much less and don’t eat much of foods I used to like. I really want to gain weight but just find myself unable to eat more food. I sometimes feel the need to eat or drink but not usually so I just never feel the need to. Since this has been going on almost all of my life I don’t know if is genetic or not but I really just want some advice on who I should see about it (I currently don’t have a main doctor as I just stopped seeing my pediatrician).


Is this depression or am I just sad?
So i’ll start off saying that I have never been to a psychiatrist or diagnosed with any mental illness. I don’t like to say that I am depressed because I was never actually diagnosed with it and I do not want to take away from people who do have it. I know some people are so depressed that they cannot even leave their house to do their daily activities. However, ever since the start of my senior year I’ve been very sad most of the time. Right around that time I also started smoking weed. I’ve usually been able to keep it only to the weekends but there were some times when I realized I was becoming dependent on it for happiness. About halfway through my first semester at college I decided to stop for a while and made it about a month and a half without it. However, I noticed that this did not have a great impact on the happiness with life. Because of this I think that it is a coincidence that I became sad and started smoking weed around the same time. 
I have a very hard time talking about myself to anyone but I knew one of my friends takes prozac for depression/ anxiety and has seen a psychologist and used to see a therapist. So I asked him about a year ago if he felt better after doing all of those things and he said yes. A couple weeks before I asked him this I had a kind of breakdown at his house when we were hanging out (I was high at the time tho but it’s also happened sober.) and he said that he thinks I might have some kind of anxiety problem. 
About halfway through senior year I got into my first real relationship with a girl which ended up lasting about 2 months. She also took prozac but I never talked to her about it. Since it was my first relationship I didn’t really know what to do and it ended up being kinda toxic which I think was mostly my fault. I want to be in a relationship again but I don’t think I need to improve myself more first.
Now back to the period when I was taking a break from weed that same friend asked me if I was interested in doing shrooms. I was a bit scared at first but after doing more research about how they could be potentially beneficial in helping with depression/self exploration I was more interested in them. I was however scared of having a bad trip as I had just failed out of one of my classes for my major and was very stressed about that at the time. So I ended up taking a very small amount and had a good time but it didn’t affect me mentally at all which is was kinda sad about since that’s the main reason I wanted to take them.
Currently I haven’t smoked in 2 months and I feel a bit better but not much. However now that i’m off weed i’m going to stay off of it for the foreseeable future except for maybe an occasional usage with my friends.


I felt sad basically everyday for the past 2 years. It’s not horrible and I can still do pretty much everything I need to during the day but I always have this kind of emptiness in the back of my head. I tell myself i’m just over reacting, that i’m not depressed and that it’s all in my head. But isn’t that exactly what depression is? It’s all in your head. 
However, I also think that i have anxiety and a possible eating disorder and I feel like that’s too much for one person to have and that my parents/doctor would think that i’m overreacting. I feel like i’ve had anxiety since 6th grade. I didn’t know what anxiety was back then but now that I do I feel like I can trace it back to there. However I was always a pretty shy kid and I never liked talking to strangers or big groups or anything. 
I have always been a picky eater since I was like 4. I’ve always been very thin and underweight for my whole life. I’ve always figured it was genetic and it probably is since my doctors never really saw it as much of an issue they probably just figured that’s how I was. However lately i’ve only been eating like one meal a day and I feel like it’s starting to get unhealthy for me. I want to gain weight so I can not be underweight but I just have no desire to eat much of anything. 
Overall, I feel like most people (especially in my generation) probably feel the same way I do (except for the ED). So maybe everyone feels this way and i’m just not coping with it as well as other people?",26Apr2020,1
23,Hi my name is Jake and I really like someone to talk to because my girlfriend just broke my heart we've been dating for almost 2 years and she left me pretty out of the blue and I  feel completely alone I have no one to talk to about it I would like some help please and thank you,26Apr2020,1

Hi. This is kind of my second cry for help on this app, or, in my current case, website.

Sorry. If you don't care to know any backstory, skip down to the slashes. The end of the post has a TLDR. Thanks.

I'm fourteen, fifteen in October, heading towards ninth grade. I'm pretty smart, I guess, Im taking honors classes and in a math class 2 years ahead of my grade. I'm adopted by my grandparents, I have a sister and brother, no contact with my bio parents. My life is okay, but I've been depressed for six years. In sixth grade, I started self harming, I cut constantly. In seventh grade, I wanted to kill myself for the first time, and came very, very close before I received a literally life saving call from my at the time boyfriend (who I lost my virginity to, at 13. That matters later.). We broke up in October of last year, and in December I was baker-acted for the first time. It was the most terrifying thing to ever happen to me. During this time, my grandparents went through my entire room and my cell phone, found out about the teenage stupid shit I do/did: Sex, nudes, cursing. Nothing too bad; I don't go out and drink (I have only had a maximum of 2 shots with my adult sister who supervised and cut me off), have never touched any illegal drugs (not even pot). I don't even sneak out or lie about who I'm with. I'm a pretty good kid. Anyway, during my baker act, my grandma was so angry that I curse and enjoy sex that she didn't talk to me for the entire week and a half. While my granddad did, it was frustrating. He would guilt me and make me feel like shit-whether it was accidental or on purpose is unclear. After that, I was ok for a little while. The only person who actually visited me to show love and support is my sister who has gone through the exact things I have. She is my world. Now, it's all back to hell. I still go to therapy, still on meds. I have the most supportive, though clueless, boyfriend.

////////////////////////

The current issue? I'm suicidal again. And I have been for a while, but especially since quarantine and having to stay with my family. And it's gotten worse and worse. A few days ago, maybe a week (?) or so, my boyfriend's psycho mom went through his messages, and did NOT like what she found. No nudes, but mostly innuendos and jokes. What can you expect from two teenagers in a world that refuses to sexually educate us?? She lost her shit, annnnnd called the school board (she works at our school!!!). School told my grandparents who barged in the bathroom, which I was completely nude in, getting ready for a shower, snatched my phone and went through everything. Still found out I was talking to my ex (the life saver, btw), still cursing etc. Got pissed, took my phone. Whatever, that's fine; I don't care about the phone, but now I'm bored as hell in quarantine and struggling to talk to anyone. I still have online therapy and here's when the fun part comes in!

My therapist is okay, she's from the school and my ""main"" therapist is out on leave (she had the cutest baby). I told her everything; my depression acting up again, suicidal thoughts etc. Because Im not in immediate danger, my therapist can't call to have me baker acted. She did, however, establish a safety plan: including having constant ability to contact my sister, the suicide hotline and mobile response team (they talk to people and evaluate for baker acting). She asked me to have my phone again for safety reasons, remove all sharp objects from my room, talk to my sister about my problems, and establish a better relationship with my grandparents. Therapist called my grandparents about it, called me back to tell me what they talked about and here is the cherry on top: nothing has been done. I have personally told my grandparents all I think about is slitting my own wrists (they once walked in on me trying to slit my throat. Nothing was done, but my knives were taken...however, i found one of my bedroom floor the next day. It is still in my room now.). Nothing has been done about any of the things I feel. I tell them i'm depressed and they tell me I shouldn't be because my life is great/I have a puppy/no reason to be depressed. I'm tired and scared.

I don't want to die. I have a lot of goals in my life; I want to be a neuroscience. I want to help people, i want to stop people from going through what i've gone through. I wanna stick it to my bio parents. I recently learned I have a baby brother on my bio dad's side, who I will not see because, according to my grandma, there is no point trying to help him. I want to see my baby brother and be there for him, and show him what love really is...I know that being with my bio parents will not show him love. I have goals in life and I want to be happy. But how can I, when my own grandparents call me a trashy slut and act like I'm a terrible person? I have no idea what to do. I can't leave, but I can't stay here for three and a half more years. Help me.

TLDR: My grandparents know I'm suicidal and don't give a shit, I don't know what to do. Help me.",26Apr2020,1

26,"Tldr at the bottom.

So I'm using my a throw away because a few people might recognize the main, but this is some fucked up shit and I dont know what to do about it.

I've been with my girlfriend for a long time...like really long.....really really long.

I love her dearly and dont want to hurt her. But I know I will under the right (or wrong) conditions.

So a while back i had to move a couple states away. That's another long story but suffice it to say things weren't going well at home and I had to get out.

She couldn't move with me because her mother is in poor health and she is the main caregiver.

Since she lives with her mother and due to various reasons she couldn't come to my place, it was very hard to have any intimate time before I moved. But now it's become impossible since I rarely see her and when I do the conditions arent right. Add into the mix this whole quarantine situation and you have the perfect recipe for one lonely motherfucker. TMI alert: I havent had sex in over a year.

My gf is ok with that. She has a low sex drive and it's ok. It makes the time we do get a little better. But a whole year is a little too long to wait.

I'm an essential worker. I work with quite a few attractive people and have several attractive people in my life. I try not to put myself in compromising positions, and I will never ask any of these people for sex.

But I know that if one of them were to ask me, it wouldn't take much persuading for me to take my pants off.

I've tried everything I can think of to push the urges out.

When I start having those fantasies I think of ugly grandmas or dead kittens. I've resorted to an ungodly amount of porn. I've probably watched half of pornhubs library, and I'm pansexual so that means a LOT of porn.

Short of locking myself in a straight jacket in a locked room for the rest of my life, I dont see a way to stop these urges or these fantasies.

I'm a shitty person.

Tldr: I'm a shitty person because I know I'll cheat on my girlfriend if the right person asks me to.",26Apr2020,1

29,"Hey,

I am really feeling defeated right now and thought that this may be a good way to let it out. I feel like over the past 3 years i've been on a roller coaster. Every year since, at least once a year, I call up the counseling and psychological services at my university and after a short convo they give me an appointment a month later which i never attended cause i thought i didn't need it.

What started all this was a single class at uni of and my desire to change majors. Because of that, my scholarship was put under review twice. After passing the reviews with just a warning ""not to be careless"", the uni. then put me under review (because of the changing major issues which was approved by my scholarship and not my uni). I have to say that this was not caused by poor grades I had a 3.49 GPA. Anyways I passed that year, changed majors, and talked to the university to allow me to continue. 

Next semester starts, I was getting A's and all of a sudden 1 day before exams I was put under review again for not taking 21 major credits to graduate on time. I thought in my head ""well, im fucked and they will take away my scholarship"" It got to me i got depressed, messed up that semester. 

Next semester they call me and tell me there is some slight hope, but i was already deep in thoughts depressed af. Needless to say i completely messed up that semester and resulted in the scholarship being revoked.

Now I am here, in an international country, can't tell my parents the complete story, and depressed. I can't eat well, can't sleep well, afraid to look at my phone to see who is calling. My only getaway that helps me forgot about the moment is when Im in a group call with my friends or on the ps4. 

I have thought several times lately what is the point in life, why not jump, im not enjoying this...etc . If i didn't believe suicide would take me to hell, i would've done it a long time ago. All the ups and downs in the past two years broke me. Couldn't care less about what happens in the future,  I sleep hoping I wouldn't wake up than to live as a failure iv'e become.",26Apr2020,1
30,"I'm a 17 year old boy (Portugal) and only had a gf in like 4th grade. I have a big fear of being alone in my life. What I mean is not having a gf/wife and family. This has always been a dream of mine since a child and, even though I don't feel like it is a priority at the moment, I have this fear. I think it is because when I look at myself in the mirror I don't like what I see. When I see pictures of myself last year I like it better. This also leads me to kind of a fear of texting girls, and that's something that bothers me. I have 2 friends. I of them dated a guy who she met through Twitter, he messaged her, and they dated like 2,5 years, broke up and still are friends. The other one had a rough breakup and was down, messaged a guy and now talks to him and is pretending to date him. They tell me I shouldn't be afraid, because I'm a good person and they feel like I don't have a reason to don't like myself, and to look at their examples, but when I do that all I think is ""They're both pretty girls and amazing human beings, of course they don't have problems with this"", and what happens with me is that nobody hits me up, nobody has a crush on me, even though I've been told I'm cute by some people.

31,So just to make things clear my name is not even close to the name on my account. But I have a name that I have lived with my whole life. I use it at jobs and all that but most people call me by my nickname. My real name is normally only used in professional situations or by my mom. Note I don't get along with her. In quarentine I haven't really heard my name and have been calling myself something else that I go by in a certain circle. Well I stumbled across a video where my name was mentioned (in no context to me it wasn't even about a person) and my brain shut off.

Little does my family member know that the underlying reasons as to why I called is because I’m really struggling with being alone, being sick literally 24/7 ( I can’t remember the last time I’ve felt well and not sick) , I’m stressed about certain things and feel totally isolated. 

Doing my family tree gives me a sense of belonging and I surely do love a mystery. I’m quite good at it. 
It’s ironic though, the family member is alive and was like meh don’t have time for this I’m doing XYZ- understandably..

34,"TL; DR Do you have any tips for dealing with side effects etc. while quarantining alone?

Hi all. I've been suffering with depression/numbness/anhedonia for a number of years now; mostly unmedicated. I've tried a couple of SSRIs with no luck (bad side effects). I'm was put on Valdoxan (agomelatine) about 5 months ago, and while it helped me sleep, I'm not sure it's put much of a dent in my depression. 

Anyway, I figured that now we're all on lockdown and I'm not working, I might 'use this time' to get back on the medication merry-go-round and find something that works for me. I've seen a new doctor - she has put me on 30mg of Cymbalta and wants me to see her again in three weeks for a review. The first day was really bad, I felt nauseous and got chills and couldn't stop crying. I was still pretty sad yesterday and had a couple of other side effects. To be fair, the Dr said that things could get worse before they get better. 

The thing is, I'm quarantining alone (I have two roommates but I don't see them much) and I'm finding it difficult to weather these side effects on without any support. It's also kind of a scary and uncertain time generally, of course. 

Do you have any tips for trying new meds while quarantining alone?",26Apr2020,1
35,"I have two diagnosed disorders. One is generalized anxiety and the other is depression. However i still feel like i have a lot of issues that these dont even encompass and I just feel lost and like unmanageable/unable to be constructed into a whole mental profile alot it just feels like i am all over the place. I don't have it diagnosed but I know for like 99 percent sure (1 percent for lacking credibility) that I have ocd symptoms and intrusive thoughts. However I have some  other issues that I don't know what they are or what is happening with them. All I know is that my mental health is not good.   


One issue is where i get really tense and aware of everything and just have a strong urge to get out, freeze, stop feeling anxious etc. It used to happen alot during school where I felt like everybody hated me and I did not want to be alive in that moment and I kept getting thoughts like ''I should stop fucking being here because I am bothering everyone'' ''Shut up you dont deserve to (x thing)'' and a lot of just abstract noises to calm me down. Now that I am not in public school it is usually triggered by eating lots of food or using lots of water while I am feeling particularly not fond of myself. During those moments it is so intense and nothing can calm it down and I get a bit impulsive but also highly regrettive of everything while I am doing it. 

Another issue I have is where I can't stop fantasizing about sex or relationships or potential partners. It starts when I am really sad as a way to make myself feel better and then it just continues. During the fantasies I am imagining what my partner is doing to me and usually it is some weird torture fantasy. I can start having them at any time and they take up a lot of my focus. I also have a porn addiction",26Apr2020,1
36,"
I met my husband (27)  through a gaming community, he approached me for a relationship but I (24) declined as I was in a relationship back then. Two years later,  when my ex-boyfriend left me for my friend, he  comforted me, I was lonely, and I fell in love with him as we had a lot of things we like to do together.

This is what he told me about himself back then:

- He was living with his ex-girlfriend before he came to my country. It was only for convenience as she's a foreigner there and would be homeless if he kicks her out immediately.
- He had a first wife, claims she took away all his money after their divorce and said she cheated on him. Then she took her own life. That's when he became extremely depressed and had to seek a psychiatrist. This made me feel of taking care of him more as that was truly painful. 
- He works as a system administrator and manages a lot of gaming community. 

We met and things go so well, we decided to be together, we were so happy, we got married and decided we want a baby. He resigned from his work to be with me, he said he had enough savings to give me a good life, that if needed, he can go back to work as he can work remotely anywhere. He also told me to resign from work as I was pregnant.

Due to our different cultures, things did not go well and this is when he started the abuse.

He was extremely mentally abusive, controlled my diet while pregnant as he didn't want me to lose my figure. He doesn't let me talk to any male, he deleted all male friends on my Facebook, even cousins. He accused me that I was a prostitute because I was poor and live near a red light district, accuses me that my pregnancy wasn't his, calls me a gold digger when asking money for some food I crave as I was pregnant. There's so much abuse but there are still good times which made me stay with him. 

But after I gave birth, the abuse became severe.

- 1 month later,  I'm no longer beautiful to him, he decided to take an 18 year old home and they fucked in our very own apartment. I was away with our son to take care of my dying father back then. I learned about this when the girl attacked me on texts and told me he went to her I wasn't doing well of taking care of him.
- After learning that he cheated, I lost my mind. I threw everything I can to show him how mad I was. Adultery is illegal in my country. He knew I could get him jailed with the evidence of cheating so he grabbed my phone and as it was my chance to get rid of him in my life, I didn't give my phone where all the evidence is and he grabbed and punched me and threatened to behead our son if I won't stop resisting. As a mother, it was truly terrifying. He left the girl and stayed with me. I wanted to leave him, but my father was dying and my mom's finances wouldn't suffice if we join them specially I have a newborn with me and I couldn't work immediately as no one would look after my son. I had to stay with him to survive. I didn't have any other choice. I forgave him.

Then, I slowly learned the truth about him which devastated me more.

- He had to go back home because of a fraud case. Turns out he was unemployed all the time and was only receiving allowance from his government for being disabled. He claims to be diagnosed with Asperger's. I have always suspected he is mentally disabled of how wicked he is, but I never thought it's Asperger's, because he's not socially awkward at all. He was receiving housing allowance as well. He saved money because of this, not because he worked hard like how he told me. I was hurt by this because it could be hereditary and now I'm taking extra care for my son not to be like him.
- Turns out I was a mistress, that ex-girlfriend was a fiance and they were still together before he went to me and got pregnant but she miscarried it. He brutally abandoned her. 
- His first wife didn't die, but she was taken by her family from him because he was mentally abusing her as well. The money she took from him was HER money from work.

As I soon as I found out all these, I felt like I already died inside. Also, my father died which affected me as well. He was apologetic for everything he's done. He showed love to our son more. But I was already toxic to him. I get mad easily. I curse a lot. I shout a lot. I insult people for the anything I'll get annoyed.. I wasn't this way before. I don't want to be this way,  I don't want my son to grow up with me like this, or he'd end up like me. I want to be a good parent to him.

My toxicity caused him to cheat again, then we started to be extremely aggressive with each other. We had a fight with my then 8 month old son around and he choked me. I remembered he said he would behead our son which was truly terrifying so I ran to the kitchen with my son and grabbed a knife to point to him to defend ourselves. He recorded me with the knife and my baby and said I was trying to hurt our son. 

That's when I completely gave up on him, I went back to live with my mother and abandoned him, but he kept harassing me to go back to him as he's a foreigner here and can't live alone. His mistress back then already left him as I threatened to sue her with him for adultery.  She was also attacking me so I had to fight back.

Tried to sue him for physical abuse but I didn't have enough evidence of it because I wasn't able to get a medical report immediately as I had a job interview which was very important for me and my son to survive. And cells are very bad here, I was scared that prisoners might make fun of him or kill him as he's different than anyone else, he is ""mentally disabled"" and I'm scared it might cause conflict with his embassy so I didn't want him to be jailed. I just wanted him to go back home and leave my country.

Weeks passed we talk again and I asked for child support but of course, he was accusing me of being a gold digger when I'm only asking him $100 for support for our son's formula milk so I can work. Three months since we got separated, still no child support. I was difficult as hell to raise a kid alone while carrying all those depressing events of my life. I tried to sue him for neglecting his son as well for not providing child support but police has nothing to offer help for me as he's overseas now.

I have less friends now. I am extremely toxic and hot headed. People started hating me. I don't want to end up worse and become a bad parent. Do you guys have any advice you can give me to improve myself and be more fit as a parent? I just want some advice, or you know, someone who would hear my side.

40,"So to start off with, my brother committed suicide two years ago when I was 16, since then I haven't felt the same, and I'm having a lot of trouble recovering since we were extremely close. A little less than a year ago I started questioning my existence and was having trouble coming to terms with reality and honestly became EXTREMELY reckless. In my mind nothing matters and nothing is real. I've been in an existential depression for the good part of a year but the last few months have been extremely bad. I've been disassociating like crazy, anytime I'm not focused on something my mind slips. I feel outside of my own body and the concept of who I have always been feels completely foreign. The feeling I have had for a while now is something I can't describe well but if I try it's like a mix of pure dread and fear. 

I've been having suicidal thoughts, but what scared me  was a week ago, I was sitting with a group of friends and a thought occured to me. In that moment it was perfectly obvious and clear that I'm going to kill myself. In that moment it was inevitable and I couldn't escape it because I'm not living, there's nothing worth living for. It's almost like it wasn't my decision, it was destiny. I snapped out of it after a few minutes but I'm still horrified because since I started thinking about suicide I've always told myself I can't hurt my family like that because I saw and understood the pain that my brother's death brought. A bunch of other shit has been happening that's leading my rational side to think that I'm going completely batshit crazy, but this is already getting long.

I have no real reason to feel like this. I have a good life, I've never had mental health issues till my brother died. I have lots of friends and lots of people including a boyfriend that love me, but I was raised in a culture where you don't talk about mental health so I have a lot of trouble talking about my issues to people. It honestly tears me up inside. 

I get horrible anxiety thinking about talking about this with my parents, not because they won't believe me, but because they're against taking medication and I believe they'll think I'm a nutcase which I mentioned earlier, I think I am. Hence I'm here, please help me. 18F",26Apr2020,1

I grew up in an abusive household, and I am currently saving up to move out, juggling a full time job with college and taking care of my two younger siblings. It's a lot, but I think I'm coping pretty well overall. I'm taking care of myself physically and emotionally, but I've noticed that I constantly want a partner. 

I would like to add that my parents are Muslims (I am not, but I have to pretend to avoid any further abuse). They are not fans of relationships, and being in one would increase the stress I am already feeling because I would have an extra thing to hide and maintain. Having said that, I think I'm trying to replace the parental love that I never had and never will have with romantic love.

My dad and step mom both have a history of abuse and neglect from parents and relationships and project their feelings onto my siblings and I. Mostly by guilt trips, passive aggressive comments and anything that makes us feel like we are worthless, insignificant and stupid. 

My birthday is in a couple days. My dad texted me something about it and didn’t like my answer. He didn’t really respond and 30 seconds later I got 4 huge messages from my stepmom basically calling me and my mom selfish and saying I don’t care about them or love them (there’s a bit more but personal details you know?). Now understand, this happens fairly often (once or twice a month at least) so I’m quite used to it. I thought it was hilarious how pathetic the whole thing sounded but a certain detail kinda pissed me off. 

I told my mom what my stepmom had said (mom is well aware of how stepmom is) and my mom got worried for me. I didn’t feel afraid or upset at all while texting but when I was telling my mom, my hands started shaking bad and I started picking at the skin around my fingers (a habit I’ve had since I was 7).

I also saw a western cowboy in my brothers room, and pirates sitting on a tree stump outside. There was a girl in a white dress and a nun. Occasionally I would hear chanting or whispering. Lots of spiders. My dead dog. Missing cat. This is just what I remember, and according to my family they started before that. 

I put it completely on being ghosts. Now that I think about it more, and still deal with hallucinations that are a lot more mild, I don’t know. Recently I had an episode of seeing demons and aliens. Convinced myself that my mom was working with them to get rid of me. I’m still not going to say it definitely wasn’t paranormal, even with the recent stuff. They could still be real.

54,"two years ago, you would find me in the bathroom at school crying every single class period. i was in a stupid middle school relationship but at the time, i thought that he would be my life. he cheated with my best friend. then she became my bully and hurt me every time she would get. but little did i know, her life was super hard at home. i didn't think about her life at all and instead thought about my own and the pain i was feeling. a year later, she told me that she didn't realize how hard MY life was at home. all of seventh grade, i was suffering through major depression with self harming and multiple suicide attempts. at the moment, i am 6 months clean of any self harm. my suggestion? find better friends and find a great outlet for your pain and anger. when im in a bad space, everything looks like an object i could use to inflict pain upon myself. as much as i want to, i resist the urges and write it all down. don't pay attention to your handwriting or anything, just write. about the pain, the feelings, the hurting. then i listen to music and go to sleep. i turn off all of the lights so i can't see anything around me. i wake up in the morning feeling much better and if i dont feel better, i facetime my friends and just listen to them. i listen to their voices and i realize how happy i am to be alive. i wouldn't be able to listen to their voices ever again, or see them ever again. i found great friends by moving schools. it's a better environment and i feel happier now. although quarantine is making it harder to be happy, i try and think about how i may see them soon. i swear that life will get better. sure the pain won't fully leave but it soon fades. it won't be as intense as it once was. i seeked help in a counselor and it was wonderful to have someone to speak to. i know that life will get better even when it seems like it wont. if i gave up my life, i wouldve never been able to experience life as i see it now. u can do this.",26Apr2020,1

56,"Hi. This is my first time posting in this platform, I'm not really sure how to put my thoughts to words because I don't know where to start. But I'll try my best.

I am not okay, I have been emotionally unstable for a very long time and it's just getting worse. I do have friends, but I feel like they're tired of listening to me or watch me be miserable because I've been like this for years. I also can't seek medical help because I don't know how to start, and I'm scared.

My life revolves on the internet, I feel like it's the only place where I can freely express who I am. Almost 3 years ago, I met a guy who lives miles away from me and we were in a relationship for more than 2 years. We never met personally, as much as we wanted to, we had problems with our finances, it wasn't enough. Our relationship revolved around video calls and sending each other gifts, and I was okay with that.  So recently we broke up, he got tired of me and I completely understand why, I know it's too tiring to handle a very emotionally unstable person. But I know I've been a good partner to him though I can't be there physically, I tried my best.  Since then I lost a friend, I got no one to talk to anymore. Everything just fell apart. It maybe sounds stupid for some, but what I've felt for that person was real because he was the only constant I've had for 2 years. I've been trying to be okay since he left but it only gets worse. He's already with someone else now, and it's killing me. I have been alone, I'm always alone. My father goes home only every other day, sometimes he's gone for a few days because of work. My siblings already has their own lives and most of the time I'm alone at home.

Since my mom died 2 years ago, I haven't felt really okay. I've completely isolated myself from people and shut down a lot of them. I resigned from my previous work, went back to school and met new people but I really can't break down my walls and let them in. These past years has been tough, I had so many regrets and they haunt me everyday. And the only person I've opened myself to was my ex boyfriend. But now that he's gone, I've no one to talk to and it makes me feel worse. 

For a few days now I've been having panic attacks, I am assuming that they were panic attacks because I suddenly wake up at 11pm or 12am shaking, crying and I can barely breathe. It's been happening for days and it's only getting bad. I want this to end so much, I don't even know why I'm feeling this way. I'm not sure if it's because I lost my mom, the guy I love or whatever it is. I'm not sure why no matter how hard I try to be okay I always end up being sad and miserable. 

I used to cut before, but I stopped because my scars are already showing up so much and they don't heal. Nobody notices it though, I've deactivated all my social media accounts but it seems like it doesn't help at all, nobody even notices when I'm gone. I just want all these to end. 

Especially these days that there's a lockdown, I'm being isolated a lot and I'm scared that one day I might actually just lose it and give up. May birthday was just last week and I spent my day inside my room crying. One of my cousins checked up on me, he was the only one who asked why I never went out of my room, he said he thought I already hung myself because I wasn't talking to anyone. And I wanted to do it so much. 

I'm so sorry I am so messed up I don't even know why I'm porting this. My thoughts are all messed up, I can't explain my thoughts clearly. I'm sorry.

Maybe I just wanted a release. I've tried talking to different people from the internet but it doesn't help at all. I always remember my ex telling me that I'm nothing  but a problem to people, that I always bother everyone with my sadness. And the words he said haunts me. I don't want to be a burden anymore but I can't stand seeing my father lose a loved one again... I am just so miserable right now and I don't know what to do. I'm sorry.",26Apr2020,1

I have experienced a lot of bad things in my life and honestly I have had to learn the art of socialising by myself for example handshakes, proper personal space and so on. Honestly I have started properly mastering all this not that long ago and it really opened up a new space for me, since I have always wanted friends but never had them.

Also I have became self-dependent and confident enough to travel alone, have job interviews and so on. But guess what nothing from that category is happening now and honestly it feels so frustrating for me as even like often before, I am having those feelings that all the good things in my life are gone for a while (5 years) that I will never have an opportunity to make another friend again. ( I am still socially awkward and to befriend someone I need really lots of opportunities and I often experience anxiety even when making friends online.)

I am attending therapy otherwise just I would really like to just be able to go outside, without wearing a mask and have fun either alone or with people that are my good friends. 

I know how some might ask, but isn't this easier for you, since it doesn't involve social interactions? Well not really, I have gotten used to social interactions and I believe that my peers and social interactions with them are one of the few things in my life that help me abandon thoughts about my past traumas and also they help me feel that I am not doing so bad, I have friends that I am valuable to and that other people that don't want to talk to me or hate me are at fault and so on. Well now all this just seems to be going away and I know how this long duration of social distancing could not happen, but if it will, I and people like me will be the first to get not just ""socially distant"" as people will socialise less and will include people like us even less.

60,"I don't want to go into detail too much, so I'll try my best to summarize.

I (college age) live with my mom (in her 50s). In the last year or so but especially the last three months, my mom has had extremely abnormal beliefs pop up which she clings to like no tomorrow. Basically, she is confident that Event A happened to me sometime in my life (I will decline to state what Event A specifically is) when I am 100% confident Event A did not happen. I asked her many times why she believes that happened and much of the time, she either can't give me a coherent answer or attributes it to ""God"" telling her. Event A is just one of several things she has proclaimed over the last year or so that I am really doubting if they are true. I do not believe my mom is purposefully making this stuff up as it seems like she truly believes these things (Events A, B, C, etc.) happened when I am 99% confident none of them happened. She asks for my account of these events from time to time, and I tell her the sincere truth, but she does not believe me. In essence, most of the events I am talking about are antagonizations of people/figures/institutions in her and my life. For example, she thinks some of my friends are ""bad influences"" despite never having met most of them, dislikes my job despite me not having any problems working there, etc. This has led to strained relationships with a lot of people in her life, including family. I can't say this is a unique behavior as going back to when I was 9 or 10 or so, I recall similar insistence in the truth-hood of events that I really don't think were actually true. Back then, though, this was pretty rare compared to now and it hasn't really started screwing up her life until the last ~5 years.


It seems her ability to reason coherently has degraded over a similar time period. Aside from believing in those questionable events, my mom has made several questionable choices (/behaviors), none of which are dangerous or threatening but are annoying/infuriating to me living with her, especially stuck inside all day due to quarantine. I'll give some examples: repeatedly closing my laptop when I'm using it, leaving the water running in the sink/shower/etc., slamming the door very loudly (not out of anger or anything, just because she wants to for whatever reason). There are plenty more, just little things but they really add up. I tell her that these things annoy me, and it seems that sometimes she acknowledges this, but she continues to do these things anyway. This stuff has only really happened in the last couple of months and has started straining our relationship quite a bit as huge arguments have started over the most trivial of things. My mom has also said many other things that make me question her judgement skills.

Living with her for my entire life, I have become really frustrated at how she has become like this. When I was younger, I felt that my mom was a lot more ""normal"", showing barely anything of what I've written above. I am no mental health expert of any sort, but I can't help feel that she has ""degraded"". She has been unable to hold down a job for a while, and I am worried that after I graduate college, I will have to support her (despite our relationship becoming more strained, I still care about her and want her to have a good remainder of her life, and aside from me, there is no one else that can or is willing to support her, so I don't want her to end up in a homeless shelter or anything). I have tried my best to let her know that I care for her wellbeing despite our many disagreements over the recent times and have suggested she at least consider therapy or counseling of some sort (again, I am no mental health expert, so makes sense to see someone that is to at least get an outsider's perspective), but she balks at the idea and ardently refuses no matter how I phrase it. I legitimately believe my mom's mental health is taking a turn for the worse and it's been taking a toll on me too as I become more and more worried for her future. Any suggestions for other ways I can talk to her and/or help her at least consider speaking to a professional?",26Apr2020,1
61,"trigger warning, self harm, suicide. 


My sister is 17 (I’m 20). We live in the US. She’s struggled with mental health problems since she was 11. It’s incredibly hard to explain to people just how severe it is. Everyone just assumes “oh she’s a teen, she’ll grow out of it”. She’s been hospitalized at 8 different hospitals, 2 being long term facilities, one specializing in psychosis. I’ve lost count for how many separate admissions but it’s approaching 20. Basically, as I just said she has depression induced psychosis. She’s been on several different types of antipsychotics, anti anxieties, antidepressants, but she ends up stopping taking them, or they don’t work. She’s seen multiple psychiatrists, psychologists, you name it. She needed 60 stitches in one hospital visit for self harm. My parents have cleaned up more pools of blood in her room than I’d care to know of. Her arms are destroyed. One of the hospitals she visited said they’d never seen anything like it. In November she took a bunch of Ativan and was hospitalized in the ICU. She was released in January (early, due to our insurance denying her hospital stay). My parents are literally bankrupt from so many hospital stays, ambulance rides and treatments. This past week she drank acetone and is now hospitalized again. It’s just, at this point my parents can’t afford to keep paying for it all. My mom told me she hopes they just release her. They are emotionally exhausted from trying to be supportive. They keep every medication and sharp object locked in a safe and yet she still finds a way. At this point I just feel like she’s destined to succeed at killing herself. I’m expecting that call to come (I live out of state).

63,"Hi! First time posting here. I've been in CBT for almost two years now with a great therapist. I have depression, and therapy's been really helpful in identifying/finding ways to manage thought patterns that put me in really dark and scary spirals.

I've been on my mom's insurance that she has through her job, which allowed me to see my therapist for very little cost. Without that, I would not have been able to afford therapy. However, my mom is retiring soon. She can't afford to add me to her new insurance (I'm turning 26 soon anyway), and I can't afford a similar policy. With this new change, and considering my own financial situation, I'm going to discontinue therapy in a few weeks.

I knew I wouldn't be on my mom's insurance forever, but I feel pretty sad anyway.

64,"There’s no right way to start so I will just jump right into it- I am 18, in community college (living at home), F, and have been depressed ever since elementary school. The only way I can vent is only if I am behind a screen, which I can give credit to for that from my ex-step mom who would find my journals in 5th grade with drawings of myself hanging and share them w her daughter while laughing. I think her and my dad were the reason why I try to suppress my feelings. I just find that my problems aren’t as big as everyone else’s, but late at night I think to myself how badly i want to just disappear. My home life isn’t that great and it’s not helping that I am stuck here for the next couple years. My single dad is stressed all of the time and the result of that is him exerting all that stress onto me- making me feel so unmotivated and worthless. Don’t get me wrong, I am very privileged to be living with my dad who does provides for his children financially. And that’s usually where I start contradicting myself. I like to think that i’m gratefully positive, however at the end of the day I take off my outerwear and soak in these detrimental thoughts. When I get into that zone, I usually do think about the people in my life who I would be able to talk to, but again, I don’t want to burden anyone. You must be thinking, why not try therapy? It has no attachment to close relationships and I would be talking to a professional. The thing is, I have no income and my dad lied to me in the past multiple times on how he would get a therapist for me only to have him say at the very last minute that I don’t need one and how I blame everything on depression. My dad says that even after a few times of having to check on me because people i knew would call him saying I was suicidal. great. I just feel stuck all the time. There’s not much to look forward to anymore since everything is shut down so I have been having even more suicidal thoughts.

70,"Hey. I just can’t seem to talk about this in person so I’m just gonna talk about it behind the mask of anonymity on the internet. My father committed suicide. And it has effected my mental health badly since. My father shot him self. Right in front of me. There was blood and tissue everywhere. I was only 12. I was in shock. I couldn’t move a muscle. Then the fight or flight response kicked in and I tried to carry him. I had his blood in my hands. He shot himself with a 9mm through the head. Then my emotions started kicking in. I was screaming and crying along with my mother. The police officers were trying to control us. My mom had lost it so much to the point where they had to temporarily handcuff her. Years later, I still see that scene. I still see the blood and tissue everywhere. I still remember my mom’s screams. I still remember the sound of a single gunshot. I relive it every day. I’ve already been diagnosed with PTSD. I take many medications to just keep me going throughout the day. I admittedly tried to commit suicide several times. The first time the knife wasn’t sharp enough and the second time, my mom grabbed the pistol from my hands and unloaded it. I’ve been sent to the hospital many times for “mental evaluation” just to end up being pumped up with even more drugs. Obviously, this effected the quality of my life. I was always the quiet kid. People treated me as if I was a ghost. I always got weird glances while just trying to simply sit at a table. It honestly hurt. I got many panic attacks as well especially in school. People treated me as a psychopath not knowing that I witnessed my own father shoot him self. I’m tired of this suffering. I just want to be happy. I wake up screaming because I relive the moments of my dad shooting himself. What hurt most of all was that I could’ve saved my dad. My dad was right there. Right in front of me. My dad was always depressed and said suicidal things. My young mind couldn’t comprehend that at the time. My dad was a chronic alcoholic as well. He used alcohol to escape from his problems.

The doomsday loomed near

He could feel everything but fear

And so when that day the sun finally rose,

He was but full of cheer.

Standing atop, he chanced a glance at the vast serenity

And he smiled truly after what seemed an eternity. 

His eyes were then drawn to the stellar dome; 

Whether the stars nodded their approval or frowned their stark disapproval,

He would never know

For in his mind, he had no care.

The mighty winds roared, as if to topple him

But the earth beneath whispered her welcome 

Calling him to her embrace.

A craven act, he knew for sure 

But an effortless escape it seemed.

And so he leapt, a last gallant move.

Her forces responded at once

The mind raced, the heart almost down to the throat 

But he knew it was all for good.

And so when he finally met the earth,

He gave it all away.

Her touch was warm and smooth did she seem

He smiled one last time and then his gaze fell.

The birds chirped away, alarming the liberation of a soul 

Deadly silence then befall.

Stained in red, he lay there

Silent and still, like those colossal hills

At last, he would be reunited with her 

Reimbursed to all of her facets

Earth, the body he loathed 

Space, the hollow void within

Air, the forced breaths

75,"I can't believe it....when I first started feeling horrible, my writing would become less fluent and coherent, and even when I spoke, I couldn't string together an intelligible sentence without pauses or stammers. Hence, I was worse at other things like my second language and piano, needless to say. Then I regained some of my cognitive abilities, and naturally other things which I wasn't so familiar with, like French, became more proficient and easier to pick up. It's sad, I can feel my intelligence going down again. And I know I suck at maths so this is regardless of my adhd symptoms or being so disabled at basic maths....

Like I speak more eloquently when my mind is clearer, I think faster, I can sightread at the piano better, I can speak Chinese better, I get better at French on duolingo. And I practised and worked on my language skills and they improved, so did my cognitive functioning, sort of like cognitive remedial therapy, but I did it on myself by reading widely, trying to get intellectually stimulated.

78,"My bf and i broke up earlier this year after almost 4 years together. I think its important we broke up - things were getting kinda toxic. But he is the only proper friend ive ever made. By that i mean, he actually took interest in the things i liked and i didnt feel like i was chasing him all the time to like remind him i existed. He treated me like a fucking princess. So while i dont want the romance part of our relationship back, i am so desperate to be friends with him again.
Over the years we were together i became really good friends w his group of friends but as you can imagine, i havent spoken to any of them since the break up. I have my own friends but only like 3 of them and they are all awful at responding to my messages and all have people theyre closer to so i end up getting left on read for days.

79,"I'm really at a loss of what to do anymore. To explain my life so far I'm 17, brother and father have been abusive verbally and physically since I was probably like 3. Only stopped when my dad tried to kill himself then disappeared and my brother went to college. I was also consistently bullied throughout school which lead to me dropping out after my first year of highschool. That was 2 years ago now and I've been on antidepressants since. 

My main issue stems from the fact I've basically been lying to my psychiatrist this whole time claiming they work when they don't and all they do is make me feel worse. I just feel empty and also haven't told them I suffer from anxiety, fairly constant suicidal thoughts, and self harm. I can't bring myself to tell them or my therapist who I started seeing in January but purely for the reason of getting a letter for I could start HRT. 

I don't trust anyone in my family, I don't have any friends, and I don't feel safe at home when anyone other than my mother is here and even then she never did anything bad but also never helped. This makes me not feel safe trying to get help because if anything happens I'll have no where to go and no one I can rely on.

I know I need to tell the truth but it's so hard. I was considering checking myself into a inpatient program but after researching I can't since I'm a minor and don't have a medical professional saying I need to go to one. Even though I think I'd feel awful inside one because I'm afraid of people as a whole at this point and have awful trust issues it would get me away from my family but in the end I'd still have to go back to my mom. I also don't know if I'd be able to continue my hormones or if stuff is gendered where they'd put me since I haven't had anything legally changed yet.

Overall I just don't know what to do anymore cause I can't bring myself to tell my therapist or psychiatrist, I don't have anyone I trust or can feel safe with, and have no where to go. I really need help but at this point I'm almost thinking the I subconsciously don't want it.",26Apr2020,1

I have also tried other atypical treatment methods such as, rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation,) but these also increase anxiety significantly, while also repressing depressive symptoms. I am convinced that any medication that augments anxiety also effects libido/sexual function directly, where a change (whether an increase or decrease in anxiety also effects libido). I would like to conclude that, there is no ""fix/cure"" to anxiety, its part of how we were born, and that we need ways to cope by alternative methods (Cognitive behavioral therapy, experience, etc.).

For some reason, I measure my worth and how capable I am as a person with how ""smart"" I believe I am.

I want to impress them and show them that what they've sacrificed for me and my brother was worth it. How can I do that when I genuinely believe I'm incapable of succeeding in school. I got my SAT score back and when I saw how low it was I truly considered just ending it there. The fact that I can't comprehend basic math for the life of me just makes everything worse.

The room where I work is the only room in the house where I can go for some alone time which I like after work (To read, watch videos etc) but I find it's damaging my productivity and mental health by being in the same room the whole time. Other rooms are too noisy with family watching TV. Add to that I was kind of fed up of my job before the lockdown and am currently thinking about transferring fields. It's a mixture of a bad manager (Very cold, rude and discouraging attitude which other employees have experienced) and the actual field itself not being for me. I found it easier to not get frustrated with manager and work related issues because I had a soundboard with other people in the office - now all communication is over Skype and I just feel it's not the same.

I’m a 20 year old college student who’s lost in this world 😭. I have never seen a doctor to be officially diagnosed with depression. I’ve used the word lightly all my life as to not discredit the experiences of those who are actually diagnosed with the condition. But I’ve been dealing with family conflict for most of my life and it’s been more aggressive for the past five years. It’s affected my schooling and my plans for life. I’ve dealt with dark thoughts (if you will) and anxiety attacks for three years now and as much as I know seeing a therapist would help, I’m unable to do so because my insurance doesn’t cover it. It definitely doesn’t help that my dad doesn’t believe mental illnesses are real. 

His relationship with my mom isn’t the best and when I was a kid I found her diary. I was a little shit who didn’t know any better so I read it and looking back at it, she was very much in a depressive state. She’s opened up to me about that and it didn’t come as a shock to me that she didn’t know where else to go. Mental illness in my community isn’t talked about. 

My dad is convinced all his problems are caused by her. He asked me once why she continued her behavior and I once suggested that she might be struggling with depression. He replied saying depression wasn’t real and it was caused by demonic possession. When your life is ‘good’, there’s no reason for you to be depressed. That shit hit hard because it’s not true. But it was another thing that made it unable for me to open up to my parents about my struggles. 

With this quarantine, I’ve been exposed to their fighting more and more.

I not one day felt pretty or happy and never dressed to look nice because none of my nice clothes looked good with no hair. 

But now my hair has thinned completelg bc I’m not pulling anymore but I keep touching my hair subconsciously and every time I think about how thin it is i try to block it out but it’s scary and Idk what to do i can’t go back in time and tell myself this will happen ... I’ve made a huge mistake taking the benefit of the doubt that touching my hair isn’t the same as pulling but it’s doing the same amount of damage and now idk what to do .... I’m devastated and I can’t stop crying I don’t want to cut my hair again I was so happy with the growth I can’t live with cutting it again I can’t but I have to eventually help me please thank you than you",26Apr2020,1
112,"Before I say anything else: this post could possibly be considered triggering for some.  I am NOT judging anyone elses experience or ideas and I am not trying to say I know any better than anyone else about their experiences. These thoughts stem from my own experiences and thought process only. 

Ihave had way too much time to spend in my own head recently.  Its kind of a weird place to be and it is super easy to get lost there, lol. 

Something has really started to bother me.  I am in my early 40s and I have had some experience with the mental health field, particularly during my late teens and 20s. I have seen therapists and counselors.  I have taken psych meds. I have even had some in patient time. It never dawned me to even wonder why these other people have the power to stick a label on others...but, even further, what gave them the right to decide what ""normal"" is and what the traits of a normal person are vs. the traits that are considered disordered?.What gave people the power to decide what is and is not ""normal"" about other people? 

I don't know if I am explaining this clearly so my apologies if Im not. Ok.  Think about it this way: there are 2 people side by side.  Person A is a responsible type and a conventional thinker guided by logic who thinks through everything carefully before making important decisions.   Person B is very emotional and is guided by their heart rather than their head and tends to feel thinge very deeply and jumps into everything with both feet without pausing to think anything through.  Who decided that Person A was the ""normal"" one and decided to assign Person B with a laundry list of disorders and prescribe medications and therapies ro try to make Person B more like Person A? Why is one way of thinking/feeling considered right rather than just different?   

I wish I could explain what I am getting at more clearly because this has bothered me a long time and Id love to have a discussion about it with others and get some other points of view but thats kind of difficult when I can't clearly explain what Im getting at here...Im not trying to say that mental illness doesn't exist or that there aren't people who clearly need help and are better able to function with medication and therapies.  Im more talking about personality disorder diagnoses that have become so prevalent in the last decade or 2 and the seriously blurred lines between personality trait and symptom.",26Apr2020,1
113,"For a few years now I’ve been forgetting very simple, stupid things. Like to close the garage door at night (2 times), leaving my dog outside overnight (1 time and I’m still kicking myself for that), leaving some doors unlocked, and most recently going to sleep with a candle burning, which I have NEVER done. I’ve started making a habit of walking through the house each night for my checklist of things to be done before turning in, so that’s why I’m really upset over leaving that candle. I did my checklist and don’t know how I overlooked that.

My goal here is to deeply think about what comes next as I don't want to regret the choices that I make when I come to the end of my life.

**TL;DR**

I feel like at 36, I've achieved almost everything I could have ever imagined and my life feels completely empty now. I'm very depressed and I feel like I'm slipping into a full-blown existential crisis. What do I do? How can I better think about this?

**Background**

I'm 36 years old. I'm married and have been so for 10 years. I don't have any kids (my wife and I tried a few times, had miscarriages, and the last time we thought things were going to be successful, our baby died shortly before birth.) I'm not religious, but I'm also not an atheist - agnostic I suppose?

Ever since I was a little kid, I've loved business. I had my first business in junior high, reselling candy bars to classmates at school. My goal in life has always been to build businesses and attain financial freedom, and I'm now on my third 7 figure business that I've built from scratch.

Financially, I feel like I'm doing very well. I own two homes (a rental and one I live in). I'm also making way more money than I need, bringing in close to 7 figures a year. I only spend maybe 10% of the money I make on myself, everything else is either donated or goes into my investment accounts.

Right now, I'm currently working about 15 hours a week. My main goal over the last few years has been reducing that down from a 60 hour work week which was normal for me. I really don't want to reduce it further though, because I truly enjoy what I do and would do it even if I wasn't being paid for it.

All of that sounds great, but **I feel incredibly empty**. It feels like I've been playing a video game for a long time, I finally beat the last boss, but for some reason the game doesn't end. I'm now just walking around aimlessly through the game world with no other objectives to achieve, no bosses to fight, nothing else to do.

It all feels so pointless.

I'm not sure if it's related or not, but I've started to have a lot of anxiety and some minor panic attacks and have gone to see a cognitive behavior therapist for several weeks now. It's helped to lessen the anxiety, but not anything else.

**Now What?**

I find myself constantly asking the ""okay, now what?"" question with everything:

So I could go sip drinks on a tropical beach all day if I wanted to. **Okay, now what?**

I spend a lot of time learning everything I can. I'm working on learning a second language and working on finishing my second master's program. **Okay, now what?**

I know that money doesn't buy happiness, it buys security. **Okay, now what?**

As a minimalist, I don't have a lot of ""stuff"" on purpose (in fact, my closet has two pairs of jeans, and 7 sets of socks, shirts, pairs of boxers - all identical, and a jacket. I know that in general people are more happy spending money on experiences versus physical things. To this end I spend a large chunk of the money I do spend on travel and have been to many different countries and experienced many different cultures. **Okay, now what?**

I know that doing things like exercising and taking care of your health are important. So, I lift weights and do cardio every week on a routine. I have a set amount of calories I eat every day and I'm just 10 pounds above my goal weight. So, once I get there, **Okay now what?**

I know that helping others can make you happier (and I also feel is a duty when you have more). To that end I donate quite a bit of money to charities I support. **Okay, now what?**

I know that trying to create something bigger than yourself (a legacy) can provide fulfillment. The businesses I've built help a lot of people and I treat my employees very well. I make sure to not only provide amazing perks and working conditions, but also pay in the 90th percentile of salaries for the positions I hire for. I've also started brainstorming a non-profit that I could build that addresses an issue that's very close to me. This will take me a few years to do, but once I build it and it starts to achieve its mission, **Okay now what?**

And that's when I think I snapped a little bit this past week.

**Catalyst**

I was watching a nature documentary and it had a segment on mayflies. What really struck me was how short and meaningless their lives seem. They literally hatch and then die in about 24 hours. They hatch, fly around for a bit, mate, and then it's over. Done.

I found myself thinking, are we really so different? Sure we can imagine and build new things, we have language, art, science, etc… But in the end, we're born, go through life consuming, mating, etc.. then we die and that's it.

I started thinking - does anything that I do really matter? What does being successful really mean if it all gets taken away anyway?

Besides our own mortality, (and I know it's cliche), but also true that one day you and everyone you've ever known will be gone. At *some* point our sun will enter a red giant stage and start to expand, completely cooking the earth until it literally turns into a lava ocean. Even if humans make it to another planet, eventually there will be no gas left in the universe for new stars to form and everything will die and just turn to a black void.

So, if that's our reality as not only a species, but everything we know, why even try to do anything at all? What's the point? Why does anything I do even matter at all?

I feel like I'm starting to spiral and need to get a hold of myself. **I'm very depressed** and I feel like I'm slipping into a full-blown existential crisis. What do I do? How can I better think about this?

129,"Hey, thanks for taking the time to read this. So I’m 23, finished 4 years in the Army, I got back from 3 months travelling that I saved up for last month, and I start my new job’s training (from home) tomorrow. 

I’ve been constantly unhappy, varying from manageably unhappy to hopelessly unhappy since the age of 11. Every choice I seem to have made in my life has gone wrong. I failed at school, I sucked at most jobs I’ve done, I didn’t enjoy being in the Army (nor was I good at it) and I’m going into this new job (law enforcement) feeling like it’s going to be another bad choice. The only time I’ve ever felt a period of actual happiness was during my recent travelling trip. It was the first time in my life I actually looked forward to waking up and I couldn’t believe it. It was a totally new feeling for me. Now it’s over and I’ve gone from travelling the world to lockdown in the space of a few days, it just seems surreal. I feel like I’m back in that perpetual cycle of dread, just as I saw a glance of life out of it.

I’m now quarantined in a room in my parents’ house (since start of March) and I feel myself just deteriorating every day. I feel like I’ve taken a step back in progress as I’m a 23 year old man living with his parents, it feels almost pathetic. I feel like an asshole because I should be grateful to have them, but all I do is yearn for my independence again. I’ve saved some money to get myself on the property ladder but I don’t know when I should or can feasibly even start that process due to Covid 19 and the looming economic crisis coupled with extortionate house prices, the money I’ve saved barely scratches the surface. I’ve looked at temporarily flat sharing for a year, I don’t know if this will help.

I think what has also added to this is that I was in a relationship for a while with the first girl I’ve ever truly adored, and she finished with me just before lockdown. It’s been 6 weeks and she’s still on my mind constantly, which makes me feel ridiculous because she doesn’t give a damn about me.

I feel totally lost, I don’t know what my purpose is and I feel very fucking alone. I don’t think this is something I could vocalise to someone in person. My parents have commented off hand on how miserable I am and are basically annoyed by it. I understand. When I’d come back from barracks to visit them some weekends I could usually put on a brave face and be happy to see them, but now I’m here 24/7 I can’t maintain the facade. I can’t talk to them about it, nor anyone else.

I can’t enthuse myself at all and I’ve spent hours upon hours just staring at the ceiling, thinking about what the fuck I should do with my life. The only thing I can get myself up for is physical training in the garage, but even that has become difficult to do (I’ve trained consistently since I was 15). If I could describe how I feel at the moment, it would be like an endless tunnel with no light. I shouldn’t feel like this, there’s been nothing catastrophic that has happened, but it’s as if the years of dread and anxiety have caught up with me. If you read all that, thank you so much. Just wanted somewhere to vent. I just wish I could be happy, and look forward to my life.",26Apr2020,1

132,"A lot of things revolving around age gaps in relationships/ephebophilia, racism, colorism, sexism/assault, etc make me (18F, black) upset, so I just pretend that I didn’t see it/hear about it. This usually purely exists online so I like to censor/block things that unnecessarily cause me to be upset (think like a random person’s comment or post, not historical events), and I tell myself that I didn’t see it

When I overhear comments irl related to topics that trigger me I just try to convince myself that I didn’t hear it and leave the situation if possible

Is this harmful in any way? I’ve decided to stop expressing my viewpoint on these things that detrimentally affect my confidence/happiness and have decided that it’s not my job to save people from being “lost”. 

I saw a girl on twitter say that “I learned the hard way that you can’t pretend to not see harmful things forever, and that you have to learn to thrive despite them”, but ignoring their existence is a part of allowing myself to thrive because I spend less mental energy worrying about the truth of how people perceive me due to my position in society and instead focus on my hobbies, grades, and finding people who are similar to me interest + experience wise",26Apr2020,1
133,"I once stated  to a psychologist, paraphrasing, that, ""It feels as though I am living life through a a movie frame. I have for as long as I can remember,  not had a clear or definite sense of self. As a young child I can remember being praised for my grades or artistic abilities and potential. I perhaps thought that success would be automatically granted to me with little to no effort. After elementary, I began to perform poorly in school and rarely made concerted attempts to succeed academically. I don't believe I was prepared for a radically different social and academic atmosphere. I probably was challenged beyond my comfort zone and actually had my intellectual abilities challenged; and I succumbed to the pressure for fear of failing. I started playing football on a team and I suppose that provided my mom with a reason to praise me. Home life was unstable. I switched schools nearly every year after the third grade. I was socially anxious about starting nearly every school year at a different school. I haven't studied much or gained knowledge on any particular subject, nor have I challenged myself towards growth. I can't say that I gave any hobbies, actually. My daydreams and aloof ponderings are, sadly, what I invest and consume myself in in place of living an active participating life. The notion seems slightly blissful yet foreign to me. I look at YouTube videos, some of a particular mental health expert, and she seems so passionate and driven about helping others whom have sustained NPD abuse and it provides a bit of hope to me that I can change and evolve for the better. Perhaps, I was and am just average, which I could accept, if it would facilitate my being joyous and content. I would prefer this realization to one of frequent fantasized daydreaming and dissociation from reality and all of the accompanying misery and angst that I feel constantly. 


My mom had married to an abusive partner and I felt unprotected in the home and was eventually kicked out for a period after a physical fight ensued with my then stepdad. I felt cornered as a young teen by a much bigger person and threw the first punch and was overcome and sustained a minor injury. I learned to suppress my emotions and my input as I felt invalidated. My mom, I feel, also neglected me and my younger brother throughout our lives and I think that she is also a cluster b personality; possibly a narcissist, herself. She has had tremendous struggles and endured abuses in her life; and I understand that bringing children up while enduring mental health issues is a tremendous struggle. Frankly, I feel they my family dynamics are dysfunctional and perhaps quintessentially effected by cluster b personalities. I am at a loss as to how to become a responsible, decent and loving and joyous man. However, the effects of neglect and abuse are still with me. I realize that at some point I must take ownership and accountability for my actions. I am now in my thirties and essentially destitute. I ""live in my head"", filled with fantasies and ideations. I have been to several different mental health professionals for short-lived periods. I suppose only recently I have discovered that I am probably a covert narcissist. I have damaged professional, romantic and platonic relationships to suit my narcissistic supply.


I am an alcoholic and overindulge in stimulating acts to relieve stress and feel somewhat euphoric and for escapism for my destitute state of living. Alcohol, I used to ""get me out if my head"" and feel relaxed. It was fun for a while; however, it increased my toxic state and has contributed to my current state of misery. I have been sober for several weeks; yet, I struggle to maintain my alcohol abstinence. 


I, for as long as I can remember, have be been a miserable and depressed person. I am not sure of who I am or perhaps I reject my true self in-lieu of perceived social and worldly expectations of myself. I have wasted tremendous amounts of time daydreaming and ruminating about a life in contrast to my existential reality. I cowardly run away from conflicts which I should engage in to defend myself. I was bullied by family members and peers growing up and I still sustain this passive stance when confronted with conflict. Covert narcissism suits me in most of the criteria and presentations of the disorder. I lack empathy and a genuine connection to figures and and realities of the world and disengage rather opting to intellectualize my world experience. I would truly like to live an active and rewarding life of self-awareness, empathy and joy. There seems to have been fleeting periods of this lively bliss; however, generally, I have been a miserable, self-loathing person critical and paranoid of people and the world and at least partially framing my self-understanding through my perceived reciprocating judgments that the world provides. 


I am missing out on life and look around and have nothing but some material items and mounting debt to show of my life to this point. I judge myself in relation to others and feel envious and inadequate. I feel inadequate in many ways and areas. I overcompensate this distress with intellectually putting down other people thus making me feel superior. I have grown accustomed to this maladaptive behavior and am not certain as to how to live a more healthy life. It seems as almost insurmountable. I know that I have to stop blaming others and become aware of who I am while self-improving. I intend to seek out therapy soon and hopefully will receive the help I desperately need. I have squandered many opportunities for mental health and in so doing burdened society with all my various periodical endeavors at receiving mental help by way of insurance funding. I feel tremendous regret at this; yet, I still have feelings of the paradoxical somewhat acceptance and non-resistance to my pitiful circumstances. I should be more vigilant if I am to attain a life of worth. I am filled with regret over the span of misery of my life with my antisocial behaviors. I don't have a grasp of who I am and have alienated nearly everyone from my misbehavior. I am certain that I am a covert narcissist; however, my path to recovery seems less clear and surmountable. 


Any insights are appreciated. 


Thanks. ",26Apr2020,1
134,"Hello


History: 

I was raised in small city with little to none problem/lie and anything that's going on in cities.when I was 13 my we had to go to another country because of my parents work.I was 14 years old when I first fell in love and after one year of trying hard and building my future and dreams around specific person I got rejected, sounds normal but problem is my hormones were nearly 3 times the usual amount which wrecked my body and mental health. When we returned we migrated to capital of province (again dont know correct word).To make matters worse I passed test and accepted for special school in  which kids with higher than average brain go. (dont know what these types of schools called in eng) after 1 month I was doing bad, i mean nearly worst person in school. My looks at that time was let's say not good and i was humiliated for my grades,looks and every possible thing you can imagine. I dont know what it's called but I cant easily communicate with others and I was mimicking what others usually say when talking so I never made any friend.my father is teacher there too.the way he looked at me it was unbearable after 2 years of highschool my mind snapped, I could no longer understand pain and I began hurting myself with sharp things like knife,razor,mechanical pencils.for some time I enjoyed the pain.and last 2 years of highschool i made only one friend who literally kept me alive and made me not kill myself. If we add university entry exam stress and my parents who were humiliated me every time they saw me and when I told them about my problems, it makes for a very good mental hell.

Right now I'm in university and doing pretty well which brings me to my current problem.

PROBLEM:

sometimes now I lose control of my body,start crying and behave like enraged animal.like I want to punch,throw,yell and kill someone.when I think about how I want to rip people's limbs off and see them suffer it makes me happy and makes me laugh uncontrollably. I'm short temper now and when I lose control  I cant even talk and just want jump on someone and brutalize them. Right now I can control this bloodlust by just not moving or locking myself up in my room but I'm worried that one day i may lose control and go insane.since there are no psychologists out there because of covid-19 and I wanted to ask if there is a way to treat myself at home.",26Apr2020,1

My mom acts like I'm the monster here and it breaks my heart...",26Apr2020,1
137,"((Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this. ))

TL;DR: Uni is mentally exhausting and I maybe shouldn’t have gone but instead started some kind of career through an entry level job. 

(By simple I mean jobs with mid to low academic requirements that demand more practical knowledge and experience. )

I am currently a university student and as a school kid I always had pretty good grades and am the most “classically intellectual” person in my immediate family so I’ve always felt like a bachelor’s and master’s degree would be the way for me. 

While the job prospects for my degree are still what I want to do, most of the lectures and testing procedures themselves are so far off of my interests and competences.

All of my creative traits that could have been/ still might be fleshed out into career paths are suffering as well. 

I really want to at least see it through for a bachelor’s but I find myself thinking about dropping out frequently and working a job that doesn’t require much mental exercise but pays enough for the bills so I can kind of stagnate professionally in a ‘good enough’ space at least for a while. 

None of my friends or family would understand this as they belittle mental illness unless it’s psychopathy and expect everyone to strive for an income of hundreds of thousands. 

I just want to go back to that time during my gap year where I worked full time in a pharmaceutical warehouse, earned good money and still had enough energy to write and design at home and even an actual desire to go out with friends.

I won't do it, not because I'm scared but because it won't change anything; I'm a burden to the people I love alive or dead, it's better for me to fade into black. Try as I might to change who I am each spark fizzles out, it's impossible to keep a flame in a vacuum. Of course I care, of course I love, but what does it matter if I cant give it to anybody. It's a failure of the very reason we exist: to love. It's so hard to express yourself when there is not much to express, no thoughts, no feelings, no opinions, it's a wonder anyone ever spent their precious time with me, though not so much these days.

140,"I’ve (24F) deleted my profiles in the past but the difference between now and then, is that I’m actively really trying to get better. I recently got re-evaluated , diagnosed with BPD, and am attending weekly therapy sessions and taking meds to help me improve. 

The thing is, social media was always a temptation to me. I constantly found myself cyber stalking people I am no longer friends with. Whether that be former flings or former best friends. Lots of these friendships ended because of me. Even when I’ve deleted them from my friends list, I still check their public profile. These are the people I genuinely miss. 

With former flings, it’s not really because I want them back, I just had this deep curiosity to see what their life is like now. Who they’re dating. How do they look now? And then my mind spirals into: Is his new gf better looking than me? Why her over me even though it’s been years? I don’t think I really care to check up on them to reignite any flame because that was so long ago. I just can’t help it. It’s become habitual. It needed to stop. 

Social media has taken so much of my time for the past decade or so. I’m not sure how to fill the time. I also struggle with GAD, MDD, and OCD. So sometimes when I pick up a book, (to try and stop this terrible habit of being on social media for hours) my OCD kicks in and all these thoughts pop up and trigger my anxiety which then makes me depressed. I don’t know what to do with myself now that I have so much time to not check up on these people. And I, of course know that I can easily look at public IG profiles (even though I shouldn’t) without actually having an IG and I’m just really trying not to.

My Brother and I lost our Dad to suicide in January 2018. Our Father battled depression, anxiety and other mental health issues most of his adult life. He was a psychiatric Physician Assistant who primarily worked with and helped young kids as well as prison inmates. He was amazing at helping others with many different and often severe mental health diseases. His death inspired my Brother who is a film sound person and editor to develop a new podcast called “Epilogue.” It’s about suicide loss and resilience. The pilot episode was recently released and follows a family in the wake of losing their sister/daughter to suicide in 2017.

I’m from the UK, the north east to be exact. One of the poorest areas in the British Isles and Europe, a dire place at times but also my home and the home of my family.

I’ve struggled with my mental health for years, every year thinking I’d hit the bottom and climbing up only to fall further again. However this is different now, I feel like this is the final part of my life.

I consider killing myself every single day, telling myself not today, do it tomorrow and trying to push today’s demons into the future to keep myself going.

I’m through with everyone. The older generations have taken and taken from my age group. Put the boot to our faces for their own ceaseless greed and disgust at us. They have taken my future.

Now I’m being asked to give up a year of my life, not just give up actually, to be under house arrest for the indeterminate future to save these people. One of the years of my youth to extend their lives for a year and change.

It’s illegal to see my own mother, to leave my house for more than work, shopping or an hour of exercise. All to save an age group that has belittled and stolen from us for our entire lives.

Yet the entire nation is clapping for it, literally clapping every week. The nation that as a collective voted to strip the NHS to the bone is now in some sort of weekly ritual,clamouring to save their collective souls by clapping like it  will undo the past.

People are so fickle and hollow.

The worst of it all is once they get through this dystopian nightmare they have created they will go straight back to posting #mentalhealthday #heretotalk as if they didn’t throw everyone dealing demons or melancholy onto a pyre out of sheer panic and selfishness.

Even better, the elders we “saved” by sacrificing our best years. Once this is over they will be once again back screaming like wrinkled banshees to leave Europe and “Brexit means Brexit” to ruin their own children’s future despite all their sacrifices.

We are heading into a worldwide depression, giving up our lives for now, our rights and freedom for the future and our prosperity forever. To save a moribund group that hates us, and has always hated us.

Let me start this by saying that I (F30) was recently diagnosed and struggle with depression, severe anxiety, and obsessive compulsive personality disorder. I’m still being seen to decide if I have PTSD, OCD, social anxiety and others.

I have a small group of best friends who I have been friends with for more than half of my life. One friend I have know since birth. My friends and family tell me to call them or reach out when I’m struggling but I don’t feel anyone is genuine. I don’t believe anyone when they say they love me or care. I always wonder why they would lie to me about that what they get out of it. Almost like they are making fun of me. I always feel like a burden and although they say they love me they are only saying it for some kind of weird pleasure in making believe that I’m loved, if that makes sense. 

I don’t feel a genuine connection or genuine love from anyone in my family especially my parents and siblings. I believe my kids (10, 6, 5) would be better off with out me and wouldn’t really care if I died or left. My youngest would be happy to live with their dad and my oldest would love to be with my parents. (I have sole legal and physical custody of all 3).

158,"alright so this started a while back, about a year ago from now, and i had an extremely low self esteem at this point in my life and was facing other issues so I started self harming. I did a couple things that would typically be expected but one of the most common things I did (and I'm not even sure if this could be called self harm) was to take a pair of scissors against my face and try to remove skin imperfections such as spots, dead skin, that sorta stuff. I would try and remove extremely small imperfections that were probably only visible to me as well as larger more obvious ones and I would do this on an almost daily basis. Back then I considered this to be a way for me to express my self hatred so that I could injure myself but not as severely as with other self harm methods. I believed that I was trying to make myself look better at the time because I thought I wasn't good enough, so basically because of low self worth. Thankfully my other self harm habits have gone away but this one still remains and I'm not even sure if you could call it self harm, but I'm pretty sure I've heard a term for it somewhere so if anyone knows what it's called then that would be a great help. Also the reason why I am currently still doing this is more out of habit rather than self hatred, thankfully I have managed to overcome my mental health issues but I would like to be able to get rid of this habit so any information on how I could stop this would be really appreciated, thanks :)",26Apr2020,1

165,"One of the things that I noticed commonly pop up when browsing many of the mental health subreddits in the past few months are certain concepts around pervasiveness, permanence, and recovery when it comes to mental illnesses and/or mental health problems. Specifically  with OCD, generalized anxiety issues, fears/phobias and depression. The concepts that many appear to believe are as follows:

\- Mental health issues are binary things. You either have one or you don't. For example, you either have OCD, or you are a normal/neurotypical person. 

\- *If* you have a mental health issue or a mental illness, it is rooted *primarily*  in biology and brain chemistry, and it can never go away. You can only learn to ""manage"" it but it will remain a looming threat for the rest of your life. It is similar to diabetes and cancer in this way. 

Now I understand why people might feel this way, and please correct me if I am wrong (looking to have a discussion here), but the data that we  have so far does not support the idea that mental health issues are binary and  permanent. To me, it appears that all humans have the underlying mechanisms that could result in a mental health issues (which could push them ""over the line"" if they encounter enough stress or trauma). However, with that said, it is true that some humans have a higher tolerance towards that stress and trauma innately. Additionally, with respect to the more common mental health issues noted above, remission and recovery is very possible, and with the right effort and attitude, these people can lead ""happier"" lives than ever before. 

If I think about OCD for example, some of the key mechanisms that appear to be at play are:

\- Fear of something

\- Experience of anxiety, and development of some sort of practice (or compulsion) to mitigate this anxiety

\- Having intrusive thoughts

\- Aversion to thoughts that are negative

\- Overestimation of the consequence of said thoughts, inability to discern them effectively. 

\- Aversion to risk of threat

\- Propensity to ruminate, and over-analyze, etc. 

etc.

In various degrees, these items appear to be common in ""normal people"" too, albeit at a lower level of intensity (and anxiety). Moreover, there appears to be very proven ways to improve one's ability to deal with these each of these items (EPR, ACT specifically for OCD -- as well of various medications). 

Therefore sufferers from OCD or any related anxiety disorder seem to follow the common pattern of:

1. Overestimation of threat (threats that are largely common to all people)

2.   Underestimation of one's ability to handle the ""threat"".

I'd take it one step further by arguing that the very *idea* that mental illnesses are permanent, and that they are binary (you either have it or you don't)  is damaging to one's estimation of their ability to handle the threat. It makes the threat much stronger, and terrifying. I was reading this study recently  ( [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4647297/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4647297/) which partially inspired this thread) and it had a few interesting takeaways:

\- Many people with mental health problems recover, and just involves personal effort and support from others. Moreover, the very concept of  ‘permanent disability’ in a mental health context is toxic, and should not be used. 

\- Overemphasis on diagnosis increases mental health related stigma and may reinforces the idea of a meaningful gap between two groups (the ‘mad’ and the ‘sane’). 

Anyways, am I missing something here? Why does the idea that mental illness are similar to permanent illnesses such as diabetes, cancer comes from? To me, mental health should be treated like physical health. Everyone needs to take care of their mental health, similar to how they should be taking of their physical health. Even ""normal people"" can benefit from practicing exposure to their fears, and acceptance based approaches. 

Sure, being overweight sucks, but you can lose the weight and potentially become healthy if you invest in diet and exercise.  No one would argue that obesity is an inherently permanent conditions, even though it has a much lower long term remission rate than OCD and depression does. 

Note, I am not saying that these things are easy to overcome. They are frighteningly difficult to overcome, and may be a challenge that lasts many years.  I am also *not* arguing that these mental health problems don't exist, or that they should be taken lightly. Far from it. These are things that are very distressing and have to be taken very seriously by everyone. At the same time, the idea that these things are binary and permanent are harmful and appears to be untrue, so why is it so prominent? Were there any research groups that concluded that people generally do not overcome depression, OCD or  other anxiety disorders despite choosing and committing to proper treatment?

Of course, certain people are more pre-disposed to developing health issues (be it physical or mental) but it seems for the majority of the population, this issues are surmountable. You can overcome your challenges and feel better, possibly better than ever before.

173,"
I'm in my early 20s. About a year ago I was hospitalized at a mental hospital for the first time ever. What happened was one night my mother was being abusive and my brother hit me. I called the police and they didn't believe me but saw that I was very emotional and stressed and my mother told them that she had never been abusive (which was a lie) and that I needed psychiatric help. I was taken to the mental hospital and committed. The experience was so horrific it actually caused me to become so depressed. The loss of autonomy, being forced to take medication, the clearly overworked and some even unprofessional staff, being around violent patients, etc. I didn't feel human. It's been a full year since that and I still haven't moved on from what I'd call an ordeal. I couldn't wait to get out of there and even when I was out I found that life meant so much less to me.

It's interesting because before the night I was committed I had several jobs that I really liked, a good amount of money, I had colleges lined up to choose from (I didn't go to college straight out of high school), and I was overall in one of the best if not the best period of my life. I went from the best time of my life to literally the worst time. I lost all my jobs due to either being fired or quitting because I was so stressed and didn't care anymore, and it showed to my employers and coworkers. I committed a petty crime that I'm now on probation for. I spent all my money because I didn't see myself living much longer and I thought I'd be dead by now due to suicide from the sadness. I would literally spend hours just walking around my town and other towns and going on buses and trains and to shops not doing anything, searching for purpose and to feel something; I was once stopped by an authority and was told to stop coming to the area so much without doing anything because ""it's unsettling"" and then asked me if something was wrong. I have nightmares frequently about this and I think about it literally every day.

I'm in college now. I would get therapy but I can't afford it. My insurance only covers part of it and I have no job. I really can't get a job now due to the state of affairs and it would take a while before I had enough money put aside to do this. I can't even drive. How do I get better when I no longer want to live? How do I move forward?",26Apr2020,1
174,"I am stable with my bipolar and borderline. I’ve been taking lithium. It pretty much fixed most of the outburst and spiraling issues. 

Except regular emotions. I know I’m supposed to have them at times (and even what they are) but they just *arent there*. I see how it affects those closest to me. And I try to use words to explain how I feel — how I know I have felt for decades and just suddenly are blunted to... and nothing. It’s like my body shuts down when it is faced with emotions. Like how morphine sedates your nerves. And then when I’m faced with them, I tell myself to focus on what I know is true, and then reiterating what I know is true (that I love my husband and kids) feels like (and to me, sounds like) it’s reading off a cue card. Nothing in it. Just words. It has to be worse for my husband and family to be on the receiving end of it. 

I’m told the lithium is just putting me at a new baseline; that I feel emotionally flatlined because I’m used to my emotions being drastic and very very noticeable. That I am feeling things but I’m just not as tuned in, but would adapt with time. That I’m just on the normal baseline now. But this can’t be normal. Right? Is this what it’s like to be normal? 

Also this took me like half hour to write because I keep saying things wrong from my head to my phone.",26Apr2020,1

180,"It's been why I've now lost 2 of the people I ever held closest to me in my life, my 2 best friends, 2 of the people I felt understood me more than I do myself.  
I always inflict hurt upon everyone close to me, unknowingly. Like, I'll be oblivious to it until everything suddenly breaks down with that person and I'm left feeling helpless and knowledgeless about what just happened. Only at the very end, once everything is unfixable, they tell me what I did wrong. By then, it's far too late to do anything. All I can offer are apologies and promises to change.  
But today was the day that I lost my second best friend to this. And it made me realize that every relationship and friendship that crashed was because I am self-serving, oblivious to others, and I pretty much go against everything I stand for as a person; everything I hold dear.  
I've always believed that I am a great listener, a great source of support and strength to all my friends, and that's what I've always been lead to believe. And now it turns out that all that's happening is that they're forced to make excuses for me, and try to retain a shred of faith in me because I do, at my core, believe I'm a good person who wants nothing more than to heal people.  
I don't understand this completely. In hindsight, I can look back on specific instances where this has taken place and then understand where I went wrong, but for the most part, I still cannot find where I made mistakes or went wrong or hurt close ones unless I'm explicitly informed of the situation.  
But after today, I have been able to understand that this is a trend with me, and it's leaving me more alone and broken and empty day after day after day, and I sincerely need help.  
I cannot go on like this. I already tried to take my life the last time this happened.  
Please, help me.

185,"So I’ll start this off by saying no one in my family is healthy. Both my parents are overweight, my mom because of a medical condition called hypothyroidism. As a child, I’ve always been a little chunky but my parents deny it. I’m around 5’3 and 160 lbs at the moment, which is overweight for my age. I’m also not very active either. 

Ever since I was little, my parents would discourage me from playing sports because I was bad at them and I should “stick to what I’m good at.” I have some disabilities(dyspraxia and some other developmental delays) that make my co-ordination a bit slow. Because of this, I developed a deep hatred of sports and refused to try hard in gym because I was scared I’d make a fool out of myself. I’m pretty sure that the reason for their behaviour is because they don’t want me to get hurt. They believe that since I’m extra clumsy, I’ll get injured which is a fair assumption. 

My parents also have no idea of portion control. We’re a family of three but my mom cooks to serve an army. She has no idea of portion control and will serve my a large plateful of spaghetti for example, when the recommended portion size would be 1/2 of that. Another example is she’d pack me a sleeve of Oreos for lunch while my friends would be packed 2 or three. If i brought them home she’d ask why I didn’t eat. 

My mom is constantly on diets as well. She’s pre-diabetic because of her medical conditions. She’s gone on a liquid fast where all she drunk for a month was protein shakes. I think this was when I was about 12 years old. She also will cook for my dad and me, but not for herself because she’s “not hungry.” Watching my mom develop an unhealthy relationship with food effects me, even though she tries to encourage me to be confident about my body. 

I’ve always had a pretty bad relationship with food. As a baby, I lived in an orphanage where we weren’t fed that much so when I was adopted, I would stuff my face full of food because I never knew when I would eat next. I eventually realized I was in an environment where food would always be available and I stopped hoarding and binging on food. 

In around grade 8, I realized my weight was just getting higher and higher while my height was staying the same. I realized I wasn’t healthy and worked very hard to lose weight. I did exercises in the secrecy of my bedroom and counted calories obsessively. Somehow on my journey to lose weight, I became unhealthily. I was eating 900 calories a day and I had lost around 15 pounds in a month, bringing my weight to 115 lbs. I was still at a normal weight, so no one noticed, my friends even congratulated me. I didn’t tell my parents but instead chose to recover by myself. I started eating when I was hungry again and gained the weight back, even though that put me to be overweight. 

I think I may have developed binge eating disorder around this time because I’m a whopping 160 lbs and I eat constantly. Instead of eating a small serving of chips, I’ll eat the entire bag before realizing it’s empty. It’s like mindless eating, I’m not even hungry when I do this. It’s usually in front of a TV or while playing video games. I don’t want to become someone who uses food as a crutch or distraction. 

Recently during quarantine, I’ve taken the incentive to lose weight and become healthier. I’ve decided to become vegetarian and when I told my parents, my mom laughed at me. I’ve also started exercising, still in the secrecy of my bedroom because my parents wouldn’t approve. I’ve also started eating less, cutting out juice, candy and junk food from my diet. Here’s an example of what I would eat in a day:

10 strawberries and 2 scrambled eggs for breakfast. A salad or some fruit for lunch. Maybe a cookie as a snack. And for dinner I’d have a grilled chicken breast and cheesy baked zucchini. 

My parents confronted my earlier, mostly my mother, and asked why I wasn’t eating. I tried to explain I was eating a normal amount of food and what I was eating before wasn’t healthy, but she didn’t listen. She told me I was anorexic(which is a LIE) and berated me. 

I don’t understand why they don’t want me to be healthy. They think I should stuff my face all the time. They are oblivious to the fact that I’m overweight and keep on gaining weight, despite my height staying the same. I want to be healthy. I’m not doing this with the goal to be 90 lbs or anything, I just want to slim down to a healthy weight and be able to run around without getting over exerted within a couple minutes. 

What do I do?? I’m at my wit’s end and there’s no way to avoid them, especially since my country is in quarantine and we’re home 24/7.",26Apr2020,1

189,"Just venting or seeing if anyone has any advice or whatever. Everyone I’m close to are going through a lot because they’ve lost there jobs so I don’t want to bring them down further. In November I finally started seeing a psychiatrist again and after hitting rock bottom with my mental health, financially, ruining my personal relationships and trouble with alcohol. I got on Lamotrigine(200mg) and made progress towards fixing all those things.

My issue now is the main thing outside of medication that helps me is practicing the sports I’ve been involved in my whole life for 18 years combined. Also spending time with people close to me. Between work and those two things I basically have no free time and I stay busy. Doing all that makes me just go to bed from being tired when I’m at home.

However now without those things, I’ve been doing terrible the past few months of being by myself and having too much free time. I go between being extremely sad/crying or being angry at everything. Also I’ve been paranoid as hell about getting sick, not trusting people and sometimes when it gets really bad the government. All I want sometimes is death for this to be over, but I’ve always kept myself alive for the people I’m close to. Also what I used to do is self medicate with alcohol and it takes everything I have to not go back to it and drink until I can’t think.

I’m not good at getting anything out of just texting and calling people. Also outside of my sport not many things do much for me at all, yes I enjoy videogames but that doesn’t fill that void at all. It’s hard to find away to get all the bad energy and thoughts that bring me down. I’ve haven’t done anything in months besides work for the sake of social distancing and health but it’s honestly breaking me slowly.

Another thing is that I love traveling thankfully I somehow still have a good paying job after how much I’ve messed up in life that allows me to. It’s always given me something to look forward to but I have vacation time coming up and I’ll be stuck at home all day everyday two weeks since our vacation time is set and we can’t move it. I also live alone and don’t see anyone. I’m not sure what to do about all of this I’m trying to wait it out but no one knows when it will end.

TLDR: made a lot of progress getting help for the past year but now I’m regressing a lot being constantly sad/angry and paranoid.",26Apr2020,1
190,"Ever since this quarantine started, I've been progressively been on the computer more and more hours during the day. I've noticed that it gets to 1 AM and I've been on the computer all day long. I don't even spend that much time with my mom nor my sister now because I'm on discord with my friends or playing dead by daylight or league of legends or minecraft with friends, idk.

For example, it's raining today and I LOVE rain. I usually love to just be on my bed under the blankets when it's raining enjoying the sound of the rain with a nice cup of tea, and today I noticed that I was on the computer again, and it made me sad and mad at myself because I haven't been doing what I enjoy lately and I wasn't paying any attention to the rain and how beautiful it sounds.

Not having to commute, deal with people at work all day... I love starting my day slowly with coffee in bed and being able to go for long runs around the neighbourhood during the time I’d be commuting and doing small errands at lunch time. 

I used to work 1 day from home on average before this, but I can’t imagine going back to 4 days in the office. 

Everyone I’ve spoken to seems absolutely keen for things to go back to normal so I feel completely alone in this, but I’m considering putting in a request to see if I can work from home twice a week at least on a regular basis from now on.

195,"I've been seeing my therapist for over 6 months now after trying to get into therapy for a year. She was the first one to actually respond and who had openings for new clients so I took it. I didn't feel too great about the first session, but I kept going back since it was all I could get. 

She literally talks about herself the entire time. She'll ask me a few questions to get us started, I'll give half my answer before she interrupts and starts trying to explain what I'm feeling before I've even expressed what I'm feeling. I feel like I'm being pigeonholed into this person that I'm not, when I'm in therapy. She takes small portions of my life and runs with it as the end all be all cause of my mental health. 

I mentioned that my mother was very religious and always pushed it on me and that it created conflict between us. Now she talks about her other clients and says, ""Like you, they were also religiously abused in a household where they were told every day they would go to hell, you can relate, right?"" And I'm like, ""No...? I mean, partially..."" ""See! That's the abuse, it blinds you to the reality of it and you don't feel ready to admit that it was as bad as it was yet. That's okay, it's normal, I experienced that when I was abused."" And then she'll go on about some story from when she was abused. 

I don't feel any real progress being made. I was in an abusive relationship with a narcissist and, to me, the biggest thing I wanted to work through in therapy was how someone was able to mentally manipulate me to such extremes, that he was able to control me just by making me feel certain emotions. But I told my therapist that early in our relationship he physically hurt me, and she focused solely on that incident and nothing else about the relationship. 

She frequently cites Freud and Jung ""psychology"" during our sessions. I'm a psychology student and those two are usually merely the laughing stock of our lectures. We learn about them, only to learn what *not* to do and what psychology does not look like since there is no validity or proof to their claims. One time she had me imagine I was in the car with my ex, where he first hurt me, and instead of staying in the car and crying as I did, she wanted me to imagine getting out of the car. She grabbed my hand and lifted me ""out of the car"" and said she saw such relief and peace come over me. I didn't feel anything. I felt like I stood up from the couch in my therapist's office and I was still the same damaged person with issues I didn't understand. 

Now that our sessions are all over video chat, she spends the first ten minutes of it showing me her dogs and the snow outside, and later randomly interrupts me to tell me about the book she's writing. I feel like I should be the one getting paid here. 

How does she have a license? She barely listens to me, will insert her ideas into my head, will interrupt, talk about herself, follows her ideas about me instead of listening to what I'm actually telling her about me. It's honestly just made things worse and made me even more confused. 

I want to find a new therapist, but I don't know if I'll be able to. I'm afraid there won't be anyone willing to take more clients during this time and I'll just be alone with my thoughts again. 

I took a week break from my therapist because I felt good and stable. The next week I told her that I just felt good and didn't think there was anything I needed to talk about and she said, ""Well, you might think that, but there's still a lot to talk about!"" It felt like she just needed me as a client and so she wants me to think that I still have problems to work out with her. Interestingly enough, when I used to go to her office for our sessions, there would be a different person coming out before me every other time. It seems like she goes through clients rather quickly. 

But then I go back and forth and wonder if it's all in my head and maybe she is helpful I just don't see it. I suspect that's just residual second-guessing from the manipulation I've endured. I don't know. I'm just so frustrated with it I needed to complain. I feel trapped in this therapeutic relationship and I'm afraid to leave, in case there's no one else who can help me, but I also don't want this to be my form of therapy because it's not helping. It ironically feels a lot like my abusive relationship, to be honest, where I was afraid to leave in case I never found ""love"" again, but I was also afraid to stay for the damage it was causing me.",26Apr2020,1

198,"My mother used to hit me when I was very young, not often. Just when she was really angry. But she quickly stopped that and I've started noticing signs of verbal abuse, but I decided to ignore it as I thought it was normal.

My father used to stand up for me after it stopped being physical, and I don't think he even knows.....But at some point, my mom kicked him out for it, and when he came back, he never defended me again.

I would say that I feel safe at home. There was a period of my life when I was going through middle school where I would do literally anything to avoid entering my house. There would be times where I would go to the park after getting off of the bus and just sit there for a while, doing my homework, just to prolong the time before I had to go home.

But now, I often feel safe, and there are rarely any times where I don't feel safe. But I'm wondering if I think I feel safe when I secretly don't, and I just don't know it? Is that even possible?

Whenever I get pulled out of school for a doctor's appointment, I ask to fill out the info form myself, as i feel I'm old enough to do it myself. The first few times I did it, my mother was reluctant to let me fill it out myself, and even sometimes when I was unsure about something, she would just take it from me and fill it out for me.
But when she finally let me fill it out myself, she would always hover over me and when I hesitated on a question, she would always read it for me as if i couldn't read it.

Point is, there have been many times where I saw the question ""Do you feel safe at home?"" And I would automatically stare at it for a minute or two. I'm not sure why I would, I've always been tempted to mark that I don't feel safe at home, but I never have as my mother was always hovering over me and I'm a little afraid of what would happen if she saw me mark that I didn't feel safe.
I know that she would ask me why and I would be too nervous or scared to answer, and then she would force me to change the answer.
I'm also secretly afraid that the doctor wouldn't believe me if I had told them why I chose that option.

Victims of abuse often experience self-worth issues, and these illusions are so compelling that we think they are real.

A life where they aren’t fulfilled. Everyone has a goal, and most the time people don’t achieve it. 
To me that’s just a fact of life. In my current position I could accept that I’ll never get where I want to be or I’m consumed by the idea of getting there. 

That’s an idea that’s been in my head since i began feeling depressed 6 years ago. Either I’ll embrace my emotions or I’ll be consumed by them. So far, I hate to admit but I’m being consumed by them.

Honestly, I’m just scared and sad. And everyone else is too.",26Apr2020,1
210,"Today is a little rough, I don't know why, I think it's the fact that I'm stuck at home and can't do anything about it, I don't get along with my family very much and my house is my least favorite place and the simple fact that I have to be here is stressing me out, also since there's not much to do I'm overthinking quite a lot, feeling that anxiety going up, doing a little self hating for fun, you know, the usual. 

It's like everything that I represent, everything that I am today bothers me way more, it's my hair, it's my face, my personality, ""why are you on the phone all day?"", ""Do something more productive"", ""Is this all you're gonna do all day?"", ""Well, look at that, you look awful today"", ""if you keep like this you'll lose everyone"", ""You can't do anything right"" and so on and so on. Honestly I just want this quarantine to be over, get my ass out of here, level things out in my brain.... I'm just tired.",26Apr2020,1
211,"I have never approached anybody because I sincerely wanted to befriend them. I only approach people I perceive as having good status. My single purpose in life is to be seen as superior to others. I'm pretty sure I have NPD. Not diagnosing myself, but I would be surprised if a psychiatrist told me I don't have NPD.

I'm a terrible listener. I find it very difficult to focus on what my friends tell me. My mind drifts away as soon as they start talking; I'm only concerned with what I have to tell them.

I do not value my friends' feelings. I only value having them around so I can feel ""in charge"", which is the only reason why I awkwardly try to pretend I care. I'm pretty sure people notice there's something off about me.

I can be a dangerous person with my show-offish risk taking. I often take risks as if I didn't have a brain to process potential danger.

I offer nothing useful to my friends. I only talk about myself. I don't know what makes them like me, but I'm sure I'm eventually going to be unable to keep things under control and ruin a lot of my friendships.

I should probably stay away from everyone. Of course, I can't do that. It would take an enormous effort for me to do that, but it's the right thing.",26Apr2020,1
212,"Hi everyone!
I’m 25 years old and am struggling. I’ve gone through great lengths to get on the right medications for my panic disorder and ocd and have been on psych meds since I was 9 years old. Since I was about a teenager I have had such a hard time staying on them. I know I need them. I know I can’t be without them. I’ve seen time and time AND TIME again the consequences of not taking my medication. But for some reason I keep doing it. I start feeling well after a few weeks of taking them consistently and then I skip a dose and am like “it’s okay, I won’t forget next time” and then I do. And now I’m only taking my nighttime medications and am completely aware of what’s going to happen but still slack on taking it. Does anyone else do this? Me and my Therpist have tossed around a few ideas from “punishing yourself because you don’t feel like you deserve to feel okay” all the way to “ hoping that one day you’ll be cured” but I honestly want to if anyone does this and how they help fix it. I’ve tried alarms, putting my bottles in the most used places, etc. 
Thanks in advance!",26Apr2020,1
213,"For the past few years I've convinced myself that I won't rely on anybody for I get the feeling that I always annoy them most of the time, now it seems like I am doing that thing over again and it made me question what actions should I consider taking to behave decently or restrict myself at some point",26Apr2020,1
214,"I started having this weird feelings last year when I can't take my problems anymore, I would often cry and felt useless. Then I'll have thoughts of suicide. I've got to the point where I almost jumped off a bridge (pretty cliché right). Since I'm broke, I just settled with my school counselor and that didn't make me feel better and I just felt I was judged. Then there are times I'd just cry out of nowhere and I don't even know the reason why. I then travel if I feel like it's too much already since I din't want to bother my friends with my own problems. Here comes ECQ where everyone's lives were brought to a standstill and as a university student, yeah online classes let's go. My dad's cards are all in a lending company, my mother, being a nanny, lost her job shortly after the proposal of ECQ and the food donations once a week can't really fill our stomachs. I also have a sister too so that makes us a family of 4. We weren't included in the gov't amelioration program too and it became a struggle for us to find money to buy food. Then here comes the professor's impossible demands of requirements that made my head worse. We have no wifi or internet connection and the laptoo is shared by 3 people in the house so setting deadlines and having online classes are really tall hurdles for me. Not to mention the bad signal in my place. I became sadder and sadder by the minute and one prof emailed me that I'll get a failing grade because I failed 2 exams (40% of the grade) and despite passing the requirements, I'd still fail was the last bomb. I can't think straight anymore,, I feel  so useless and I just lost all of my energy and even the will to live. I'd sleep for 15 hours and I wake up, then cry again, then cry myslef to sleep again, became a cycle for nearly 2 weeks now. I've been unconsciously hurting myself like stranggling my own neck, or when I'm in the kitchen I can imagine myself stabbing my stomach with knives or if I'm in my room I'd just suffocate myself. I'm afraid that my family will call me crazy because of what I'm feeling and I don't want to tell them.",26Apr2020,1
