0,"TW: I am someone who is trying to find a remote job and it's not working. I owe people money and my roommate (and person who helped me leave an abusive house hold) suggested I apply just everywhere. I just about flipped out, panicked, and thoughts of self harm came. The thought of not working remote scares me and it's been that way for years.I feel safe on the internet and not out of it. Any help I've gotten for this and many of my multiple issues have not be addressed or have just been told to jump in head first and get a job. Is there ANYTHING that I could try to do that wont at best invoke panic and potentially trigger self harm at worst. I don't have a whole lot of money so my options are very limited.",28Aug2020,1
1,"I never go outside during daytime and I stay in the dark all the time. I only go to the streets when it is dark, I don't eat vegetables almost at all, only red meats. I just don't like daytime and spend it mostly sleeping or being in a dark room. I don't feel comfortable during the daytime, not because of people, I just don't, I don't know why.

3,"I don't know if I might sound crazy or anything, but this has been going on for a week and it's driving me insane. It's like my brain wants make me feel like I'm a cheater. Now I know damn well I would never cheat on my boyfriend because I love him with all my heart, but I keep questioning myself over and over again. The problem is this feeling I get (down there) either when talking to someone, thinking about someone, or just seeing someone on social media - I started taking this feeling as being turned on. Now I know that being attracted to someone isn't cheating, as my partner has told me multiple times, but it's like the more I think about it, the more I get this feeling in response to basically everything. And then I started obsessing over what I do when I get this feeling - moving my legs, touching my lips, I take that all into account and I think of that as cheating. And omfg, it's the most horrible thing, because the more I stress about it, I start getting inappropriate thoughts about whoever or even whatever it is i'm overthinking about. 

There's other things too like this one time I was talking about masturbation with a friend of mine and pretty soon I started thinking of that as cheating but it wasn't like we were talking about having sex with each other, but I keep thinking about it and stressing about it even when my boyfriend said it was all fine. There's this other time I kissed my beloved bunny plushie and then for some reason was reminded of my ex (his nickname for me was bunny), so I started to think of that as cheating because it was like I was kissing my ex??? (idk my reasoning is so screwed up but I can't stop thinking about it). So this is all really stressing me out, it's basically taking over all of my thoughts, and I know I'm stressing out my boyfriend to because I keep ranting about it so I just-- I don't know.

I've been trying new medication, but so far none of it has had any benefit to me, just shitty side effects.
When i was waiting in the pharmacy for my new medication to be ready, i just broke down.
Pacing back and forth frantically through the isles, pulling my hair, constantly on the verge of tears. 
These past few days i've felt especially suicidal. 
Every day i wake up and i just genuinely want to die. It feels like nothing is helping. I don't know how much longer i can take all of this. All i thought about while pacing through those isles was how much i wish i had a gun so i could just end it all. 
It's been almost two years since i've been to the mental hospital. I thought i was getting better, but i'm still at the bottom. I feel absolutely hopeless. 
I saw my mother and talked to her about it, and she said i should consider going back. 
I'm just so stuck on what to do.
I want to die so bad, but i don't want to hurt my mom, and i want to go to the mental hospital, but it's just so fucking expensive, even with insurance, and i don't even know if it's going to help.

8,"Hi there,

I know this isn't the place to get a medical diagnosis but I am looking for advice in starting to figure out what might be happening to someone I know.

They have a history of some mental health crisis, being hospitalized a couple times for a spiritual emergency, being the best term I could use.

They currently went through a period of overly intense stress / pressure, followed by many nights of very little sleep. They then had a pretty big delusional moment of thinking ""they"" were talking to them, that they were going to come get us etc. This night has been followed by very erratic behavior, of constantly slowly pacing around with eyes closed, kind of like in a trance (they call it a zone). They firmly believe they need to do this, but cant really explain why its working. They will come to periodically and be spaced out / tired, but able to communicate more freely in that time. If trying to talk to them they will most often not respond, whether intentionally or not hearing you. They feel like they are needing to keep busy, and making lists, or constantly feeling the need to move. Restlessness. 

There may have been signs from a few months out that something was changing, but otherwise this all came on within a period of 1-2 weeks. 

The pacing often stops with falling into bed of exhaustion, only to get up a few minutes later. 

Memory is also an issue, with forgetting what day it is, or time of day, or how much time has passed.

Dementia? Schizophrenia? Alzheimer's? Curious to hear others thoughts.",28Aug2020,1

15,"I can't take photos of myself or see my own face in the mirror because everytime I do, I feel devastated. It has gotten so bad that most of the time in my own head I see myself as someone without a face at all, and this image brings me comfort. 
 Generally, my way of overcoming this image of myself in my life has been working hard to do good things for others, animals and the environment, I often tell myself that I may not be beautiful but gosh dang it, I can be kind and I can be a good person. While I still hold this to be true, I long for days where I can look in the mirror and maybe not be a super model, but at least not look so horrifically ugly that it brings me to tears. A day where i can look at myself and not feel sorry that the image staring back at me is my own or wish that I could tear away my image entirely. I just want to be happy.
 Surely, somewhere on this sub has felt this way at some point and/or knows/has picked up some tips to overcome this fear of my own image? I can't look in the mirror without dry heaving on the worst days and shedding tears on the best, I can't be in photos or videos, I can'lt look at myself and this is ruining my life and bothers the people around me.

17,"long story short, started seeing a counselor abt 2 months ago, and they said it sounds like I have mild depression.

the way I see it, it's like I was hit with a ball, thought I broke a fucking bone and was in need of a wheelchair, and in the end it was just a bruise.

I dont know if that made sense whatsoever but I'm just so fucking embarrassed and confused. 

and I just got out of a session where we talked abt challenging my thoughts, but I literally dont know how to counter this one. I feel like I made all my pain up. I feel overdramatic and stupid. and augh fuck me. I feel like I should have never even asked.",28Aug2020,1
18,"ok so i kinda get like intrusive thoughts but instead of my brain telling stuff like WHAT IF you did this, its telling me that i am doing that, its constantly telling me that i am being touched all the fucking time and its extremely distressing, when it happens ill have reactions that i cant help such as shushing but it depends on what the thought is so if my brain tells me that im kissing a family member then i might try to rip my teeth out, these kinda of thoughts happen all the time.

In the past ive tried forcing myself not to react when a thought happens, but its so hard ill try so hard on making sure im not using my mouth (such as shushing  or yelling) that i dont even realise im using my hands ( doing stuff such as hitting myself, scratching at myself or snapping my fingers or shaking my hands )

Some days they'll be very light, just causing clicking or shushing and theyre very easy to get over, but some days they can be extremely bad, for example the other day by dad grabbed me be the waist, and later that day i could still feel his hands on me, it was so bad i was scratching at my waist, yelling, biting my arms, it got the point where i was considering taking a knife and carving out the skin on my waist so i woudnt have to feel it anymore.

On top of this some of my 'reactiosn' have started coming out when im not getting the thoughts, for example ill be happy or excited and start shaking my or snapping or when im distressed ill start shushing quite bad and clicking my tongue.

This has been occurring for a months now, ive experienced similar much lighter things in the past but its never been so intense and i just really want to get some  help.

Id really like to get some thoughts on this, ive been looking into sexual ocd and it sounds somewhat similar but im wondeirng if anyone else has thoughts on what this could be.",28Aug2020,1

21,"I've been extremely depressed for a while, yet all I can tell myself is that I'm not and I'm just seeking for attention, which is irrational, since I've made sure that absolutely nobody realizes that I'm feeling this way, and nobody has ever asked me about it. I think my depression comes mostly from how little confidence I have, since any time I made any mistake my parents would tear down any confidence I had, and that's something that's happened all my life, to the point that all my accomplishes seem worthless and all my mistakes, even small ones, are crushing. I graduated in the top 2% of my country last year when I finished high school, and the best in history and literature specifically, that felt good for like 2 days, then I just convinced myself that it was meaningless, and that anybody could have gotten that, so I'm nothing special.

22,"So when I was younger, I've always said words I saw out loud. If I saw ""quesadilla"", I would say it in a ""funny"" voice. Or if my ears pay attention to a certain car on the road, I'll just loudly say ""BEEP"". I always thought I did this because it was interesting to me at that age and it's just habitual now (I'm 18m btw), but I'm starting to think that is not the case.

Yesterday, I went to the store to grab some items for my mom. That was when I started noticing that I just say words aloud for what seems like no reason. I thought it was weird how often I couldn't stay quiet at the store, so it was definitely in my mind when I went into work that night. As I thought, it happened a lot at work too. I would read receipts items aloud, I would yell ""BOOP"" as the next car came into the drive-thru, or I'd just say something completely random like David which I pronounced as ""duv-eed""

I don't know if this is normal because I thought it has always been for a good part of my life. Is this normal, or is something going on with me?

29,"Growing I was a very positive and outgoing child but around 6th grade I got really possessive of my friends or that's what they tell me. So in middle school I tried to find new friends that didn't mind if I was possessive and in 7th grade I found a friend who I later noticed how ""clingy"" so she just left.

In 9th grade, I wanted friends and I never felt like I had any that I actually cared about. Fast forward to today, I've given up trying to make real friends and just keep fake friends. I pretend I feel close to them because they're the only people who really talk to me and they are good people.

I have a couple of questions about AITA. The first one, I treated myself like I was always better than my friends because that's just how I've grown up. I was probably rude to my elementary best friend and didn't really care. I would always be at her house because her family was nicer to me. I took the friendship for advantage, I think I had unspoken rules, like I could go chat and make new friends with others but I cared when she did the same.

The second time, I went everywhere with my 7th grade best friend. I hung on to her even though I don't think she liked that and asked me to stop a few times. I would tell her I'm still processing how I felt when my last friend left me and would just continue. I made fun of her a little in a playful way but was probably mean.

The third time, during covid I was working on the Maths project for school and I had my friend do it nearly all. I didn't understand any of the math that we should have learned and without her I probably would have failed. She did most of the work and I try to justify it to myself because I did what I had to do.

I find myself thinking about suicide or killing myself almost everyday but I never have really considered and obviously have never gotten close to attempting it. Personally, I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety although I think there may be something else (but maybe not). I’m pretty sure I’m not depressed because my main problem is difficulty controlling mood swings, particularly anger, irritability, and sometimes a feeling of emptiness. A lot of times, when I get stressed out (which sometimes happens suddenly with some mood swings) I think about how I could end my stress by dying but that’s basically it. In other words, I often play around with the idea of suicide but, again, I don’t think I’ve ever considered it.

I ate about 1,500 to 2000 calories a day and would do interment fasting. There’s was one hellish week where I only ate yogurt and deli meat on a diet wrap for meals. I only had 3 meals a day and no snacks and workout my body everyday for that week. I started to get dizzy and vomit while I did workouts (not fun times at all).

32," 

I've posted about this plenty of times before, but here it goes again, with a new layer of clarity.  
I suffer from OCD. Over the years, it has taken many forms, many shapes. The latest one however, has got to be the most lethal so far. Because it is based on something I actually did.

In October 2016, I was 17 years old. I had turned 17 four months before that. My little cousin was with me watching videos on the computer. She was 9 at the time, if my calculations aren't off. At one point, she grabbed my hand and told me she wanted to show me something. She dragged me to the entrance of my parents bathroom. I didn't know where she was going with this. She then said she wanted to see my underwear. I told her no. She insisted. I said we should go back to watching the Mr. Bean videos she likes so much. She told me no. So I showed her my underwear. I either did this by pulling a bit off the side, or unbuttoning my pants and showing her the top edge of my underwear. I didn't show her my genitals, at any point. It wasn't sexual to me at all, I was actually very uncomfortable and just wanted to go back to what she was doing before (watching videos on the computer). She then said she wanted me to take off my boxers. I told her that no, I couldn't do that. She kept insisting. I said, alright, pushed her away, went into the bathroom (with her outside), and proceeded to hang out there, with my pants still on. I then came out and said, there , I did it. She told me she wanted to see, I told her no. She kept being pushy. I pushed her out of the bathroom again and locked myself in. This is what haunts me. I recall I did take off my pants whilst I was inside, and she was banigng demanding to be let in. I don't remember clearly but I think I told her ""there, I did it"". I remember I then realized how weird the situation was, so I decided to just go pee. Maybe to justify the weirdness of it all. I put on my pants again, as well as my underwear, and unlocked the door. She demanded I let her see. At this point, I became stern, and I simply told her that no. That that is somwething only grown ups do, showing each other their privates. I told her we should go back to watching Mr. Bean on youtube. She then asked me to not tell her dad she was asking to see me naked.

And that's it. That's more or less the whole story, at least all I can recall clearly. At this point, I feel my life is over. What I did is horrible, and I find myself thinking of what I did as child molestation. For some reason, this didn't bother me until at least a couple of years later. Why didn't it bother me? Was I objectively a horrible person before? Nowadays, I am 21. I lived my life after that, I went to University, had girlfriends. All of what I am is tainted.

She hasn't brought up the event ever since. We still get along, and nothing else weird has happened ever since. She has told me I'm on of her favorite cousins. I don't know if she's damaged by the incident. MAybe she is. If she is, I don't think I can forgive myself. I am seriously contemplating suicide by now. Because no matter what I do, no matter what my life becomes, I am stained by the fact that I hurt a child.",28Aug2020,1

35,"They/them refers to my SO. I use non-gender-specific pronouns to eliminate further possibility of the internet finding out whom I, or they are.
We aren't considered legal adults in our country yet, for those of you who want to know for the story's context.

I don't know where to put this, but I need help. I'm spiraling since I have no sense of stability anymore, in my relationship or anywhere else, and this whole situation is shooting my anxiety to heck.


Dear lord, where do I begin with this...

My SO came into my life 3 years ago, and we started dating 2 years ago, due to them wanting someone to talk to, and it evolved from there. Since then, I've met their family...

Their dad is kinda socially awkward, for reasons that will be explained later on.
They have FIVE SIBLINGS. Three biological, one adopted, and one foster kid (these kids will also get some backstory).
They have some other extended family (excluding dad's side for various reasons, most of which I expect is because of trauma of some kind), some of which I'll explain too.


Sweet Christ Almighty.


I love my SO with all of my heart. Although they have their downfalls, like joking about violence despite it not being my favorite, having plans change at the last second, not having many friends or much of a life outside of our relationship (which are explainable), things are good... sorta.

They recently announced that they may or may not be moving 2,000 miles across the country. They do not know when exactly, but have everything packed up, because...

Their mother wants to.



This woman is BATSH*T CRAY CRAY. 

She makes impulsive decisions on a dime, like recently getting a bird, and this complete waste of my time and energy that involves moving.

She forces my SO to take care of his five siblings while she naps or is on her phone (SAHM), and the dad works as an I.T. guy. By the way, SO has a faint heart murmur and grey hairs from dealing with them 24/7.

She tells me horror stories of how her adopted child came to be in her care (they changed the kid's name after him hearing it for 3 years. He's 4), and how her foster child's mother behaves.

Because of the aforementioned move, they want to, and I quote, ""get rid of"" the foster child that they've had for nearly a year now. This kid is a whiny 4-year-old who cries all of the time, but I thought the mom was kidding when she said, ""I might just throw her to the wolves""...

She tells SO things that they don't need to know. She encourages violence and doesn't step in when the siblings act up (they CONSTANTLY fight and throw each other down the stairs). She tells my SO that they're a sociopath (NO WONDER THEY HAVE SELF-ESTEEM ISSUES).

She got them a job at at nursing home DURING A PANDEMIC.

She also uses therapy as an empty threat in arguments, such as, ""If you're going to act up and be so unstable, I'm sending you to therapy."" SO has legitimate issues that need to be addressed by a professional, but they aren't getting help because their help is seen AS A WEAPON.

I was told their cousin would beat me up if I were to break their heart.

I don't know what to do. I love my SO, I really do, but...

Their mom is... crazy.

If I'm looking to the future, I don't want psychopathic, psychotic in-laws watching me everywhere I go, and commenting on everything I do.

I don't want to be the ass that breaks up with SO because of their parents, since my dad is also a narcissistic asshole who makes life hell for anyone's path he crosses.

By the way... she knows my mom's and dad's addresses...

She rules the house. Everyone bends to her will. The dad is a shell of his former self, the kids are becoming tiny terrors in their own rite.

My SO's car and phone are registered under their father's name. Unfortunately, their father holds no power over anything. It is a complete and utter dictatorship



I'm losing my shit and I have no clue what to do



TLDR: My SO's mom is crazy and I don't want to break up with them, but I don't know what to do anymore",28Aug2020,1

40,I’m simply that. I haven’t cried in 3 years no matter what happens. I don’t have emotions anymore. I hate when people (especially my parents) try to talk to me. I feel like it’s a burden when they have to ask me what’s wrong so I just said “it’s nothing I’m fine”. It’s Like a different person takes control and shoves normal me somewhere else. I feel numb.

48,"Hello r/mentalhealth! I'm an ethics teacher in sunny Sydney and we're currently studying discrimination in year 10 (15/16 year old kids). I'm reaching out to you because of an article I remember reading. In the article, a dad shares his story of his two daughters' hardship. One had a mental illness, the other a ""physical"" illness (I believe it was cancer - I might be mistaken). 

The article was a really great way of contrasting how we're yet to master the treatment of people with mental illnesses. The daughter with cancer had a much clearer path of treatment. I'd love to share it with my students because it's a concrete example of systemic (and unconscious?) discrimination.

52,"I've been diagnosed with ADHD-PI but I'm pretty sure I have GAD as well considering some of the symptoms I've experienced over the last few years and especially this year. I'm wondering if I have a mild form of OCD but I'm really not sure and would like to hear from people who may understand what I'm experiencing.

The issues I'm about to describe began about 5 years ago and have gradually been getting worse. I'll talk about each one individuality.

The first and most noticeable trait are my urges regarding numbers and patterns. Things don't ""feel right"" unless they are a certain way. For example my music playlists must have a certain number of songs in them. With this example that number must be a multiple of 50. If not I get a feeling of unease. Also for the total number of MP3's I own it has to be a multiple of 100. If I'm deciding how many people to follow on something like Twitter I'll avoid certain numbers as I don't feel as comfortable with them. I would rather follow 10 accounts than 7 because I guess I prefer numbers that end in ""0"". In regards to patterns I feel the need to fill up any empty space. As an example on my Xbox One game library I feel the strong desire to have either 4 or 8 games installed because it fills up either 1 or 2 rows without leaving any space. Having only 3 games installed feels the worst because it only fills up 3/4's of the space.

It hasn't happened recently but in the past I've dealt with a powerful urge to keep checking something even when I know it hasn't changed. It always has to do with something really minor like the volume on my computer or the setting in a video game. Sometimes I'll check it 10+ times even though I know for certain it hasn't changed. The constant checking has never happened out of fear like with some who must check that their door is locked or that things are unplugged over and over again.

My other issue is my obsession over the things I ""want or need to do"". I've experienced it in different forms but lately I've had the urge to go over the list of hobbies I want to try that I have in my head. I feel the need to mentally go over the list over and over again and usually the more items in the list I need to keep track of the stronger the urge is to mentally repeat them. It happens with hobbies but also with the list of pets I may want just to give another example.

My last problem is strong desire to resist change. Even for the dumbest things. For example I have an office chair that doesn't even work properly anymore but I'm having trouble replacing it because it's the chair I've used for almost the last decade and even though I should get rid of it I have memories wrapped up in the chair as stupid as that sounds. Same with the way my room is laid out. Everything has a very specific place and it makes me uncomfortable if anything is moved.

Anyway just wanted to see if anyone could relate to my issues. Not sure if I actually have OCD or if my problems are related to the ADHD or GAD.",28Aug2020,1
53,"in search of testing that can be done. 
I have not been on any medications for 2+ years. speak to my therapist of 4 years a few times a month. 
so a little back story: my mother has bipolar type  1, her father did also with a couple other diagnoses I can’t remember and passed away at 57 due to alcoholism. her brother has bounced in and out of mental hospitals and jail, but we are not close so I don’t know much more than that. since a child I have always had this feeling I was not normal but never was medicated or tested for anything. I got by seemingly just fine, but it wasn’t easy. this continues. 

when I was ~25 I decided I was ready to look into this. (currently 28) I always intentionally ignored it as it was a can of worms I didn’t want to open. I was proud of my self for finally opening up about it and looking into it. it was an instant relief and felt so hopeful, than shortly in, it was the exact opposite. 

I found a therapist and a psychiatrist and began working with them. my therapist has been the most helpful. I was hoping there would be one clear cut diagnosis and some meds that would make it all go away. there wasn’t. I got a loose diagnosis of bipolar, ocd, add, etc. I was put on anti depressants, mood stabilizers, lithium, adderal, xanax as needed, (helpful) over the course of a year or more I tried different combinations of probably close to 10 different medications. none of it really helped and some of them brought on different issues. I spent a week in the hospital due to families concerns and then did an out patient program for probably a month or two after. 

it all was aggravating and I just wish there was some test or something that could be done to analyze my results. like there’s things I feel I really excell at that are difficult and simple things I struggle with a ton. I feel like if there was some monitor on my brain through these different things it’d show very abnormal or interesting results. 

I’m an extroverted introvert I like to say. at the end of the day I’d rather be alone. everything overwhelms me. sometimes I make a lot of lists that include things like, put windows up in car tonight, take a shower, eat. the worst feeling is feeling I’ve forgot something. I’m always uncomfortable. when I’m alone I’m my most comfortable, no one knows that side of me. I feel like the people who know me best, know 25% of who I really am.

So, I (15F) think I have someone else in my head. I’d like to call them a split personality, but they’re not just a separate personality, they’re very much a separate being. They’re distinctly different than me in so many ways, and I can usually tell the difference between them and I. I’ve done research on whether or not I could possibly have DID. It seems very similar to whatever I have, except that I don’t usually have amnesic gaps in my memory. When they’re in control, I’m almost always still present and experiencing everything. I just don’t have the majority of control over my thoughts and actions. It’s extremely unsettling, and happens often. I have plenty more things about them that I could talk about, but I’ll stop here since I can’t remember them at the moment.

I’ll repeat over and over again to myself that I’m weak, I don’t actually have issues, nothing I ever went through was bad enough (it was. I think?) and it’s only when an outsider will look at me in horror after I casually mention something I’ve experienced that I think “hm... maybe I’m not being ridiculous?” But I invalidate myself so horribly that I can’t tell what is reality. Why do I do this? I’ll even imagine myself going to therapy and trying to talk about my problems, and immediately my brain will tell me the therapist is going to think I’m being stupid and dramatic, they’re not going to think my feelings are valid, they’re going to think I’m ridiculous and a waste of time.

58,"Hey Reddit, as we move through this pandemic, we accustomed ourselves to a new way of living. For me, it's been rough. Here is some back story.

When The pandemic hit, I was working out daily almost lost all body fat and had good muscle tone. My friend kindly shared his basement with me to work out. He had a good set of dumbbells. This worked for me for a solid month, and did some awesome progress. But his uncle came to live with them after heart surgery, so I had to go. At that point, I had lost all motivation to exercise. My health followed with it. Since I used to eat 3000+ calories a day and burnt it at the gym, I was used to it. And without exercise those calories became weight gain. 

I gained almost 20lbs, lost my muscles, and my stomach came back. I stopped talking to most of my friends, since I hate excessive texting. I am not a social person in any way, but I like face to face conversations a lot more. I lost all interest in my hobbies. Cooking, video games, web design, reading, drawing, piano, bringing movies... I don't feel like getting out of bed, and when I do, I just end up listening to music and sitting on the couch or laying in bed.

Sometimes I get small waves of depression here and there, feeling worthless, stressing over paying for school (out of money after paying for my semester) and worry about my future. But today I finally hit a point. You ever got so depressed at the point that you just want to sit there and cry? Because I felt that all day. I was lucky to just drag myself out of my apartment to buy some groceries. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to sleep all day, and I just want it to end. It's worth mentioning that I would never consider suicide as an option. But regardless, I need help.

TLDR; I gained 20lbs when I couldn't workout anymore and lost all hobbies and interests I had. Close to no contact with friends and family. My diet is horrible, and just feeling like sleeping. Super depressed, at the point of wanting to cry.",28Aug2020,1

Yet, it's mainly rats.

I know what the bloody people means, I was severely abused by a different people as well as I watched a family member die at 11. Her heart failed in a movie theatre lobby, she had COPD and we weren't able to get her spare oxygen tank on her.

Her kids are never better than the other kids. Always one step behind. If I have a choice a long time ago, I would definitely move out from this house. But I'm still studying for my degree and she still provides for me... And I never had any luck with applying for jobs ever. 

We never had a really big fight. One or two where I express my frustration whenever she compares her kids. It felt shitty. But I still respect her. I do stuff that she needs me to do. I've taken the course on uni that she wanted me too. As a big sister, I do house chores. I cook, I clean. I'm not complaining fyi because I know I don't provide any money for the house groceries or stuff like that and it's my responsibility to give something back. So I just do it.

I had an opportunity 2 years ago to do teaching just like her, so I told her bout it. Of course when she told me that teaching is not a ""worth it"" job, I trusted her. Who wouldn't trust a person who have been in the job scene for more than 20+ years. So I decline the offer.

A few days ago, she told me that one of her friend's kid who are in the same course field as I am, took a teaching job at the same place that offers me one.

She didn't insinuate anything but I know the intention behind it. Of course. And it is so frustrating.

And because I decline the job offer 2 years ago, I still have no job. I am one of the unemployed amongst my graduated friends. Great.

I’m depressed, and my mom is depressed too, and she’s relying on me to make us enough money to get out of our extremely poor financial situation, but she doesn’t trust me to do that, and frankly, I don’t trust myself to do that either. I’m so depressed I can never pull myself away from my video games and my bed long enough to do anything around our intensely cluttered house, or do my artwork and make the money we need so desperately. 

I really really need someone who can message me and encourage me and remind me to get up and do things that actually mean something around here, like drawing my Owed artwork and Selling my crap, and cleaning my basement, and cleaning the floors.. 
i don’t do these things on my own anymore, but I feel like i might do better if i have someone to tell me to get up and do the things 
I don’t have any family members who are able to help me, and I don’t have any friends who are able to help me either. 

I’m really fucking not ok, but I have to pull my shit together enough to get my mom and I out of this shitty fucking house so that we CAN be ok. 

I’ll elaborate on the situation in the future, but in the mean time, message me on Discord if you’re willing to help...

78,i’m sorry i’m just venting at this point but it’s because i feel to bad venting to someone else in my life partly because i don’t have anyone but also because i don’t want to be a bother or have someone’s pity. i feel fucking insane and i’m just looking for a way to cope but i can’t find anything. i just wanna smoke or drink until i can’t feel but i’ve made sure anytime i do those things it’s when i’m happy because i’m not trying to have another un healthy coping mechanism after self harming for a couple years which i still struggle with. i don’t want to pick up another bad habit for me to deal with in the future but i don’t know what is gonna help rn and i just wish i could be numb. i’ve always know i’m not gonna make to 18 and i stg i want to. i want to live a different life than i am right now but it’s so hard to see me making it.,28Aug2020,1

81,"I'm a 20 y/o Female and I've been feeling mentally off for about 6 years now. It's gotten to a point where I'm exhausted. I'm writing this right now while feeling so numb that I might just cry. And I want to seek help but Covid-19 is making it hard. Also, my fear of starting phonecalls.
I really have no reason to feel so mentally off because, well, I'm pretty spoiled.
I live with my parents, work a decent part-time job, and don't attend school or pay bills. I have a paid-off car and my own room. I have plenty of people who reach out to me to socialize and I don't have to worry about money. I'm not rich but I'm comfortable and have normal worries like anyone else. I have no reason to be so strange all the time besides maybe a bad ex and a few traumatic parental issues. 

But I'm overwhelmed by a strong desire to just dissapear. To run away and not tell anyone. And some days to just die. I fluctuate extremely with my emotions to the point where I rather just be brain dead. At one point I'll be happy and social with everyone, the next I've ghosted people for 10 days straight and feel entirely numb. Sometimes even just within a few hours, my mood will shift. From angry one hour, to happy, to absolutely numb and sad. I can't explain my personality or why people want to be with me and that also causes me a great discomfort. I believe I'm the greatest thing alive and people are blessed to know me but also don't understand why they bother seeking me out.
I don't see anything that makes sense about me.

Just 2 weeks ago I fainted during work and then had a panic attack where I kept crying and screaming and was immediately sent to the hospital. There they didn't find anything wrong. I walked home with a $900 bill in my hands. I felt like I had just thrown a $900 stupid tantrum.
And to this day I don't know what brought that on, but it happened and I hate it. 
After that incident I kept having moments where I felt that I was about to lose my mind. I've lost my mind before, I'd huddle up in a corner and cry and rock myself and forget the world in that moment. Trying to stay somewhat sane made me feel weak and angry and numb everyday, all at the same time and my Mom wasn't helping by telling me that I just needed to pray or that this was happening because of my past mistakes. One night while she spoke I became so overwhelmed that I said I couldn't take it anymore. I had a strong desire to just not be alive. I didn't see any point in living. So I ran for a knife in the kitchen and was ready to do something drastic; she ran to stop me though and did by ripping the knife out of my hands and screaming for me to ""snap out of it."" 
We both just sat for a bit and had a crying session together and then we just went to bed.

I've also been overly obsessed with an ex who I felt betrayed me because he never seeked me out to talk about what he did wrong in our relationship. He just let me apologize for my wrong things and then left it at that. I wanted an apology as deep as mine. But I never got it. So I'm bitter, looking at his social media and hoping his new girlfriend dumps him because I know she can do so much better. There are days where I feel that if he died, I'd be even the slightest bit happy. And I don't think those are normal thoughts to have. To want someone to suffer when in reality they have already moved on. But now I think I'm moving on. I'm a bit over it and feel better when it comes to thoughts about him. But still a day doesn't go by where he doesn't pass by my mind. Like some weird fixation.

I've also recently started drinking to try and not feel so much. Drinking even just wine brings me comfort. My mom brings home some wine for me because after that incident I had started showing interest in it. So she'll bring some light rose wine or strawberry. And I'll drink it late at night until I don't feel so much. And when I think about how I even get bought wine to drink I just feel even more angry because I shouldn't be so sad if I'm being doted on. 
And I like wine not just because of how it makes my brain better but also because I like how it feels like I'm destroying myself. Even if it's just cheap wine. It feels like something I deserve, to be in a bad habit to have some idea of what describes me. I would do worse things like unsafe casual sex, or drugs, or stealing if I weren't a Christian. But my religion is keeping me from being any worse and honestly from even trying to kill myself 24/7. 

I'm so tired. I don't want anyone or anything. I just want to not exist.",28Aug2020,1
82,"I (19F) have had mental health issues my whole life including substance abuse and trauma from sexual assault. I started drinking heavily at 15 because both my dad and brother are alcoholics and it helped me get over my ocd. I always had trouble making friends, and I had one close female friendship but it turned toxic and she is now addicted to meth. I met my boyfriend when I was 16 and he rapidly became my best friend and a completely codependent partner. 

I had very bad alcoholism issues and one day our drug dealer offered me alcohol and so I went with him and ended up being unable to see or walk and had sex with him. I actually thought he just kissed me but he told me that we had sex later. Something similar happened with another guy a year later. I would use Xanax or alcohol to excess to make my obsessive thoughts go away and then I would wake up and someone would tell me that a guy had sex with me when I was out. My boyfriend found out about one of these times because my friend told and I tried to commit suicide because I had ruined our relationship and nothing else mattered to me. 
  My relationship got somewhat better and then worse. He was very verbally abusive and I was drinking a lot, then he got a DUI. He moved in with me and my parents and I was supporting him and taking him to every single meeting and court appearance. While he was living there my drinking got worse. I would enter blackouts nightly and have no memory of what had happened. I actually made another friend but when I was in a blackout I sent her boyfriend nudes. I have literally no clue why I did this, I am not attracted to him in the slightest. I think maybe I was doing it to spite my boyfriend? I would message random guys and send nudes for attention. My boyfriend is basically asexual as well and rarely ever has sex with me and that would make me upset. My relationship with him was toxic and grew physically abusive. He would still show moment that he really cared though and I had no one else. 

  My drinking reached a really scary moment when my mom threw all my liquor away and I, in my blackout anger, threw her iPad and her clothes and phone in the pool in retaliation. My dad came in and held me down and was hurting me and left bruises so I bit him. The cops came and had to chase me down and I very narrowly avoided a felony. My parents told me I have to move so I’m working a shitty minimum wage cashier job now and saving up. 
  I have OCD and the guilt from the cheating was eating at me so bad. I knew I couldn’t move in with my boyfriend (he was talking about moving with me) and carry the guilt so I told him about the cheating and he says he feels like a retard for trusting me and he wants nothing to do with me anymore and that I’m a horrible person for not telling him. I feel like I have nothing. The relationship I built for years and the only close friend and romantic relationship I’ve ever had is done now because of stupid mistakes I made while drunk. I have nothing to live for. I am thinking about killing myself soon. I can’t keep working this horrible cashier job making barely any money with no friends or relationships. My obsessive thoughts and urge to drink is so strong. I also cannot stop self harming. I know everyone at work can see my scars but I can’t stop. How do I build self worth?",28Aug2020,1
83,I feel so lost I have no idea what’s going on there’s so many variables i have no control of in my life that are holding me back. My parents hate me bc I’m bisexual and atheist. My friends don’t support any of my artistic endeavors at all and it makes me feel so invalidated about it. I never feel validated for anything I do no matter how much effort I put into it. I know it’s my fault too but I have no idea how to stop it. I’m also so sick of being sensitive. I used to not be this way but now I can’t take any kind of criticism without getting into my head and this has been causing really scary panic attacks. I try so hard to act normal and Try to keep pushing but I feel so weak. This world doesn’t run in a way where I can afford to take the mental health break I need I barely make enough working overtime as it is. I’m gonna be fine in the long run it’s just tough right now I feel lost and alone. If you’re going through anything similar and are reading this I understand how you feel and you are not alone ❤️.

The only thing that ever helped me was music. My mind tells me that I'm not depressed, that I'm faking it and that I don't need a therapist. Long story short I think I'm gonna kill myself.

87,"So I've been prescribed bupropion, I'm instructed to only take half a pill twice a day (50mg \* 2) and then increase the dose after one week (100mg \* 2). My doctor told me that medication usually takes effect after one to two weeks.

But I've been feeling really okay the past three days, literally since day 1 of medication. I don't know if it's the placebo effect, the feeling that I'm finally getting helped or school starting so I feel like I have something do after staying at home doing nothing for several months. I'm not like happy, but I feel really normal. My mood is really stable and I haven't had any depressive episodes. My studying behavior changed completely as well.

90,"When I feel like shit, in deep sadness or anger, I punch walls or tables, I bang my fists to my head, dig my nails deep into my scalp or forehead, then I just cry alone. I don’t know why I’m doing this.

This behaviour started ever since I stayed at home with my family because of the pancemic. A part of me thinks, the reason of my worsening mental health is my family and school, but I won’t get too much into that. I have been crying so much these past months, more than I ever cried my whole life.

I will start feeling like shit from the simplest things, things that did not faze me before. My parents raising their voice, getting dissapointed at me, or angry easily brings to tears. Now when my parents are being nice or ‘normal’, I get suspicious and think something bad is going to happen.

I can feel like I’m on top of the world then suddenly everything changes in a blink.

I get so overwhelmed with my own emotions, the pain in my chest, and life, to the point where I just want to dissapear.

Sometimes when I’m doing something, anything, whether it was doing homework or things I love to do , I suddenly feel like I want to stop whatever I’m doing and just, stop.

I am very concerned about my mental health, theres nobody I really can trust or talk to. 

I just want to know what is happening to me, what’s wrong with me?

101,"a childhood problem of mine has come back with a vengeance at age 27. in certain people’s homes i struggle to eat even when I’m in physical pain from hunger due to skipping too many meals. I have recently moved in with my boyfriend and his family and this issue is starting to get in the way of me living a normal life. I am unable to eat anything that is not prepackaged or ready to eat like fruit or nuts. I am unable to use their dishes for the most part. 
I was diagnosed with OCD as a kid, not sure if that explains it, just know this isn’t normal and I’m going to
make myself very sick if I keep up like this.

I end up buying a lot of food out or i just do not eat. I know restaurant kitchens can be all kinds of nasty but for some reason this doesn’t ruin my appetite.. I buy grocery store deli meals but often I cannot eat those in the house and have to physically leave the house and sit in the driveway to eat.

I have tried to “mind over matter” this one away many times and it always ends with me gagging on whatever I’m trying to eat. I feel weak from being hungry often. Is this something I can get over myself or do I need to pay for a session with a psychologist? I can’t really afford it. there aren’t really any compulsions associated with this problem, is there a possibility that this could be something other than ocd?

Hey so I am just coming on here because I need to ask a question. How do you know if you have an ED? I have super poor eating habits like binging and purging, but I don’t make myself throw up(although i have tried, with no success). I go on a new type of diet like every month (i always lose 5-7 pounds but then gain it back) but I don’t exercise too much other than daily walks. I have taken laxatives or things that work as laxatives (flat tummy tea, fiber heavy cereal, etc.). I’m not underweight, in fact i’m medically over weight for my height(which is really frustrating b/c my doctors would never believe that I ate nothing but yogurt, apple sauce, and drinking water (maybe milk if my mom asked me to) for two weeks. Also when I put food it my mouth during the periods of not eating, 
A) I cannot chew it because of how grossed out I am
B) I cannot swallow it and have to spit it out
C) I never feel hungry or full, just neutral all the time.
Some other TMI issues is that I am 16 and have had my period ONCE, I have issues with bowel (i’ll get really bad diarrhea but then not be able to shit for like two days after) and gas (not farting a lot, just pain from gas I guess?) 
My body image is obviously terrible because i’m the fattest girl in my friend group, family, etc.
And I have PCOS as well as a mood disorder. And lastly, I have extreme childhood trauma from shit i don’t want on here. My mom thinks it’s the meds i’m on, (lamotrigine), and I don’t want to tell her what I think I could be. I can’t finish, let alone start meals and my purging periods are wayyy long than my binges (binge periods are about a day long, purge periods are anywhere from 3-7 days).

113,"It was the fall of my freshman year of high school. I went to a football game and planned to meet up with my friends. I got there early and one of my friends mom’s asked me to look after her 3 year old son while she volunteered at the ticket booth. I loved kids and was good at babysitting so I took a little pride in that she trusted me with the job. As the little boy and I were walking around the track, I saw my crush with his friends hanging out near the concession stands watching the Jr varsity team play. At about that same moment the boy decided he wanted to run onto the field with the football players. I bolted after him and caught him just before he got to the field. He was not happy about it — kicking, screaming, and crying all the way back to the track where I set him down. The kid was throwing a complete fit—screaming bloody murder each time I tried to pick him back up. It was the worst tantrum I’d ever seen. Imagine — a little boy literally buckled over his knees sobbing on the track floor as I was crouched down trying to console him—he didn’t want anything to do with me. All I could do was wait until he calmed down enough to take him back to his mom.  It all happened in a matter of two minutes and conveniently took place right in front of my crush and his friends. They were close enough to see the boy crying and throwing a fit but they weren’t close enough to hear what was going on. They all started yelling at me angrily to either pick him up or get away from him as if I was being mean to the kid. The fact that my crush was the ring leader made this all the more traumatic for me.  I was as shocked as I was mortified. There I stood, unable to get this little boy to do anything but kick and cry and scream at me for not letting him run onto the football field. 

A teen mom who had just graduated HS came up and offered to help me. I knew she had a daughter of her own and that she knew the boy and his mom so I was grateful for the help but she was vaguely condescending about it and when she so easily scooped the little boy up like his hero everyone and the boy looked at me like an enemy.  I walked away completely defeated.  I couldn’t believe the look of disgust on my crushes face. I was so embarrassed, heartbroken and angry.  I’d done everything I could to keep the little boy safe but I felt like a complete failure all while my crush bullied me in front of a crowd. I felt as if  everyone there thought I was a horrible person. That single experience ate away at me over time, I not only resented babysitting after that but questioned my ability to be a parent in the future.  

I never realized how much this actually effected me until now. Am I weak for allowing it to?  I’m 30 years old have no kids and still avoid babysitting.",28Aug2020,1
114,"I had anxiety issues and some depressive stuff going on, but I was relatively stable and able to handle life. I became convinced I should try an antidepressant because I had not tried them yet, and was curious if it might be the thing that helped me get back on track. Unfortunately, after only 2.5 weeks of taking it, I was suicidal and my anxiety and stuff was beyond anything I'd ever felt before. Even after tapering off per a doctor's instructions, my mind is completely shattered. I no longer have the same personality or capacity to enjoy anything. I am afraid 24/7 for no reason. I have disturbing thoughts enter my head and loop over and over from the minute I wake up until I fall asleep. I'm unable to even enjoy time spent with my dog, or bring myself to do anything at all. I've found that doing things I enjoy makes everything worse, which seems crazy to me. The more I enjoy something or have fun, the harder my symptoms hit me. It's destroyed my ability, I feel, to have a relationship with my family. I constantly obsess over anything negative or uncomfortable (no matter how minor, like a time a family member and I got into a fight or something 20 years ago) over and over. Things that aren't a big deal or don't matter BECOME a big deal or matter because it's never ending. I can't relax at all, or feel anything other than a sense of despair and dread. Anytime I start talking about how crazy I feel, I have a panic attack and shut down. Start shaking, rocking back and forth, etc. It's insane. I had a period of time I was like this several years ago but I overcame it with therapy, internal strategies, and hard work.

Those strategies now do nothing, and I'm back at square 1 because of a stupid pill. Worse yet, the things I feel and obsessive thoughts are thousands of times worse. Nothing stops it. If a friend says hello, I freak out. If I start watching a TV show or movie, I start shaking. If I play a video game I enjoy, I feel a need to scream as loud as I can and just like go ballistic. I have no idea why I am like this other than I felt like this when I took the SSRI and it has not gone away. That pill broke me in ways so fundamental, I don't know what to do.

My provider(s) are useless. One kept saying I'm from a town I've never been to, and asked me to keep taking my meds even though I told him I had stopped per my psychiatrists instructions. He didn't listen to a word I said and asked if I could go to the ER to help with my meds. Completely useless. My psychiatrist told me that it's ""all in my head"" and ""had nothing to do with the medicine."" Yet, prior to the medicine I was stable and find just a little anxious at times. I could work, socialize, all of that. Now the more I do anything ""positive,"" the worse it gets. And anytime I do something crazy like yell, scream, or whatever: I feel humiliated and ashamed. Doing nothing is torture but at least I'm not making it worse I guess. But I need serious help. I don't have health insurance anymore and I'm at the mercy of the VA, who are completely dog shit useless. They just want to make me take more and more meds. 6 weeks on, then taper off and try something new, etc. It's destroying me. Their taper system is scientifically unsound and I'm most definitely still going through withdrawals weeks after I came off my meds. I don't know what to do anymore. I legitimately would probably submit to a lobotomy or something drastic at this point if it meant I could just be free.

TL;dr I'm losing my mind since I was prescribed an SSRI, tapered off per doc instructions, but the symptoms won't stop. I can't stop thinking and obsessing about weird shit and anytime I do anything ""normal"" it gets worse. Any advice is appreciated.",28Aug2020,1
116,"I don't know if this belongs here but I have had problems studying, because of past memories. I used to do quite well in school, and my parents always pushed me to do more, attend olympiads and competitions. They didn't allow me to play or do anything else I liked, saying I should rather study than waste my time playing. Growing up, this has led to me being averse to studying or doing work of any kind. I am a slacker in college, and I never study because of this. I don't know how to beat this.

Similarly, a related incident was that I used to be kind of an over-enthusiastic student in middle school. I always used to have an answer to every question and an opinion to every argument. I wasn't arrogant, I just didn't know this could piss off other classmates or teachers if I did it all the time. Nobody really told me. One day, as usual I put up my hand to answer a question in math and the teacher yelled at me for always answering, in front of the whole class. I was really upset and I never answered to any question in class ever again, up to this day I have trouble interacting with teachers or authority. 

The bad part is that come high school teachers only value and respect the ones who do answer in class. Atleast, in my school they did. So from that day on, as I always used to be silent, and interacting was my way of learning, I lost all interest in my subjects. Coupled with the aversion to studying because of my parents encouraging me to study all the time, I have no motivation to do anything. Even my assignments until the last minute when I have to. I can recognise this vicious negative circle but I can't stop it. 

Does anyone have any advice?",28Aug2020,1
117,"Hello. So I moved to the US 3 years ago and basically lost all my best friends and all. I was 15 at the time so basically my boys for life were all taken away from me. I had to see my best friends grow up without me, I got to see them go to their prom and everything, it really sucks. For those 3 years I haven been getting worse and worse, in I don’t feel right I just can’t explain it. I have like severe anxiety, and I can’t fall asleep at night cause my mind will just wonder to dark places. I stay up every single night because if I put my phone away even a couple feet away from me, I just think so much about my past. So for those 3 years I have been ignoring my self. Not once did I take time to think about my mental health, well now i am. Like it’s so weird to explain, but I’m just weird I over think a lot and I’m all over the place. I blink constantly and can’t even get high cause my anxiety will basically make me go crazy while high. Don’t get me wrong, I like where I am, as I have made a good number of friends, but I just don’t feel as connected to them as my past friends. And my anxiety... it’s bad, like real bad, like it’s weird i overthink too much and I’m just a socially awkward person, But I got hella freinds n all but I feel it’s just a fake personality I put up, well I wouldn’t say fake but just altered.  Okay sorry for all that typing, here are my questions:

I don’t wanna take medicine, but what can I do to help my anxiety ?
How can I sleep early at night due to my anxiety? (I’m open to taking medicine here)
What should I do to overcome my anxiety and forget the past and basically become lest weird and awkward here?
Due to my anxiety I blink my eyes ALOT and they get worse when my anxiety acts up even more, and I even do this weird thing with my lips but I do it often and I have weird tics that I do often cause of it, how do I get rid of those behaviors?

118,"I know that no one can tell me exactly why, being that there are probably lots of personal factors at hand, but I can't piece it together. I shrivel up and get intensely self conscious and insrcure around men. I have no close male friends. I can barely talk to a guy and I can never figure out how to form conversation. I become completely silent and my only methods of talking are in the form of small talk. It feels like hell. One on one hangouts with guys are uncomfortable as all shit. It hurts to have no friends, yet it's easy for me to talk to women and form close romantic relationships that seem to be longlasting. I have no problem feeling attractive around women, and feeling that way because of my ""personality"". I'm not a particularly good looking guy and I'm not in shape at all.

119,"On Wednesday, I asked her I liked her and I would like to take you out to weatherspoons for a date (popular British pub franchise) and she straightforwardly told me that she's seeing a guy already for the past couple of months and that I was just her best mate because I'm not her type (I'd assumed she wasn't into Asian guys). 
I've known her since year 10 which is (freshman year) and we've done a lot of things together and are really honest with each other. I've been told I'm good looking for an Asian, I go gym regularly along with swimming, I do A levels and have a part time job.

Now today, I haven't spoken to her since Wednesday because of how pissed off I was that she went for a skinny 6 foot lad, who smokes weed and does fitness qualifications at college. Nothing against anyone who does these things but I've been feeling like shit and down these past few days where I've gone to places alone and haven't spoke to anyone.",28Aug2020,1
122,"I’m 15f and just need to vent about basically everything.
My family and I are german, but moved to a different country when I was 11. Before then, I was shy, but did fairly well with other people. After moving here though, I had to attend a school where I knew no one but my sister in elementary school, and barely even spoke a word of English. I became extremely introverted (or maybe I was before too, it just became more of a problem), but still tried to fit in somehow. In the first two years here I had friends, not the best but we got along and hung out. Since I attend an international school though, people frequently move away, and so did they. After that I didn’t fit in much with the rest, and did ok socially while in school, but barely ever hung out with anyone outside of school.

I think I’m ok with that though. Something that I have more of a problem with, is that here, my parents have control over everything. Anything I want to do I need their help or approval because I can’t even go anywhere without having to ask them for a ride. I really don’t like how little freedom that left me. 

I have been struggling with depression since I was around 12, and maybe that did have something to do with my inability to act like a normal human being. I’m not even sure if it actually counts as depression, but I haven’t actually been aware that it may not be normal to feel like this for longer than a year and a half. I don’t even know why I would be depressed, nothing really bad happened and I have a nice family and do well with grades and everything, but I still feel like shit most of the time.

Now, around a year ago I began cutting, first on my thigh, later on my arm, and I still regret ever doing any of that. A kid in my class must have seen some of the scars, and alerted the counselor, who then told my parents. When my parents found out I believe they thought I did it for fun. They took away my razor, and we never talked about it again unless the counselor wanted to have a meeting. 

I’m not sure why I began cutting, but in retrospect maybe I wanted the attention, maybe I wanted to alert them that something was wrong. Or maybe the pain provided some sort of relief, I don’t know at this point, but I stopped. 

Not because I’m ok, I think I just didn’t want the stress of anyone finding out again. Now when people see the still partially red scars they think I’m over it, which is mostly good. But I think I might still need some support. I just don’t want to trouble anyone I know. 

Now to what inspired me to actually write this. Yesterday, I asked my mom to transfer some of my savings which I had in cash, to my bank account that I finally got this summer. She wanted me to sort through it since it was all kinda scrambled in a pouch. When she saw how much I actually had, she told me she couldn’t do that and was going to transfer it to a separate savings account I share with my sisters and have no access to. When I complained that i don’t have any control over said savings account she laughed, and said it's best that way, implying I would spend it all. I tried to argue back a little, but didn’t want to lash out. Now we’re talking about around 600 euros, which I actually did want to save to at some point build my own pc, since they wouldn’t support me with plans like that. I hate how little they trust me to have any sort of restraint. 

I know I overreacted by getting angry, but somehow that triggered a whole series of tears in the corner of my room. Those kind of outbursts happen often and I usually spend them hiding in some part of the house where I hope no one can see and in the worst ones also hear me. 

I’m sorry this really is teen bullshit, but I really don’t want to talk about this with people I know. And even if people will probably not read or understand my scrambled writing since I’m still kinda upset, it just feels good to write this and get it out into the world. It’s not everything I want to say but this is already wayyy too long.",28Aug2020,1

125,"I am in a very bad position in life. I live in the USA, I have lost my insurance and can't afford the premiums through COBRA, I was forced to resign from my job in that underhanded way that means I can't qualify for unemployment, and now I am unable to start a new job due to an illness I have been diagnosed with on the very last day of my insurance coverage.

I was in therapy for depression/bi-polar disorder but due to losing qualification for Medicaid, I stopped going to my appointments and cut my medication cold turkey.

Before that I was an agoraphobic recluse and only left the house to get necessities. I live in an area with a very regressive view on mental health among the general populace. When I called to get treatment in the first place, the police were called and I was dragged to a hospital against my will and let out the same day when they realized I'm a danger to nobody. Even the police didn't know why they were called because I'm a very quiet gentle person and too frail to even harm myself.

It traumatized me against seeking help. I know I need treatment but if I am hospitalized I will end up in even more financial trouble. Due to my illness I may also end up quarantined (note, not COVID but I am in a risk group for complications due to this condition) and only able to take remote visits, but the only sliding scale low income clinic in my area is underfunded and doesn't have the technology to do remote visiting and has a 4-6 month waiting list due to the high volume of substance abuse cases in our area.

Are there any good psyche clinics that operate remotely through telemedicine that operate within the NY/PA/NJ tristate that offer sliding scale billing?

126,"15F A week ago I stayed up all night and I got into a massive fight(no domestic abuse just shouting) with my mum and brother about school. I was so emotional sleep deprived and in so much physical pain it hurt to breathe I broke down and vented to a friend. I did talk about my issues with the pressure, stress, being forced to be someone I'm not ,suicidal thoughts. Feeling completely lost angry and upset. Just generally unhappy with being at home. 

After I told him quite a fair amount I tried to close myself back up again but I couldn't. I told him some stuff and he kept telling me to get help I kept refusing making excuses and he got sick of watching me just suffer and he left last night. I'm getting better I've come a long way on my own. 

I don't know how to get help, what to say, who to speak to. I'm not sure if I'm ready or if I have the energy or courage to talk. I didn't want to lose him because I was so deeply and emotionally connected to him and I cared about him alot. I've only known him for a year but when I left I felt numb I woke up and I've just been in pain. 

Even if I don't want to seek help for me i want to for him. He doesn't want to see me suffer and I don't want him to be worried about me.

 August 2019 I did reach out for my CSE issues but it didnt work out. I spoke to someone on the phone over August 2019 had 2 sessions at school and spoke to a GP once months ago.

In September 2019 I tried to help myself but I was in such a terrible mental health state. I did fix my CSE issues on my own though to some extent. 

December 2019 I told my friend I was down for friends with benefits (stupid terribly stupid) was sexually assaulted by him. I trusted him so much I didn't think he was capable of that. 

January 2020 the suicidal thoughts started and I pushed everyone away threw myself into school. 

 By February/March 2020 My brother found out about the CSE stuff and the assault. The suicidal thoughts stopped. I hadn't told anyone at this point. I had my 1st anxiety attack.

I just have all this pressure to become someone I'm not and its easier to remove myself than deal with it. I'm tired of crying and procrastinating and fearing I'll be a failure I can barely get my school work done. I skipped over 4 months of school.

I was meant to be aborted?, why can’t I be smart like everyone else?, why don’t I just kill myself, are all things both of my parents have said to me.

I asked my mother (I live with her due to health and safety reasons) if she could take me to a therapist but if I could go in alone and she screamed and yelled at me saying that I have nothing wrong with myself (I have anxiety attacks whenever I go near my father, I have tried to kill my self several times and have tried to run away) I retorted that I couldn’t sleep at night because whenever I did I would get nightmares of my at her hitting me with a belt several times over when I was 6; she declined saying that I was being over dramatic and left it.

To make matters worse I have two younger brothers (twins 14 males autistic) and when they were born I got neglected terribly and I’ve gotten no attention from either parent.

I have to fake a smile every time I go into school and now that I’m at the school topic, I have just moved schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, I was guilted into by my mother who now blames me because I can’t go to the orthodontist (I have braces because I was too ugly and needed to be fixed according to my mother). I left all my friends behind and my boyfriend at the time (who has now left me because my mother told him I was cheating on him, I wasn’t).

129,"For starters, I’m grossly empathetic. I feel things so deeply—all of my struggles, my loved ones struggles, strangers struggles. It’s a bittersweet thing.

Lately I’ve been battling some mild depression (self diagnosed because I’m too poor to see a therapist/psychiatrist right now). I’m a 23F and it all started a couple years ago when a lot of change happened all at once and built up trauma surfaced.

It’s gotten better lately, but still not in a good space. I won’t list out every single thing that’s facilitating it, because that would take forever, but I still try to remind myself I have a lot to be thankful for because that is the only way I can survive how I feel.

Not only am I dealing with my fair share of fucked up things, but most of my friends—if not all—feel the same. One of my friends just found out her mom has heart disease and it’s genetic, one of my friend’s dad just went to jail and is battling alcoholism, one of my friend’s just has a close friend pass tragically in a car accident, and the list goes on.

Now comes the kicker: our world is in shambles. Black people are dying, at an alarming rate, at the hands of those who should protect us. Kids are in cages at the border, with who knows what being done to them. Rape, neglect, being separated from their families, and now will carry this trauma for life. Wildfires are ravaging California and the hurricanes are destroying whatever is in their path. People are dying because our leadership is so lacking that we didn’t know how to prepare for a global pandemic. I used to love Politics, and actually majored in it, but now I’m losing hope in anything I once believed in. Millions of people are suffering, most more than me I’m sure.

The U.S. aside, there are concentration camps in China, Palestine is suffering, and Lebanon is still feeling the aftershock of that destructive explosion. I’m sure I could list yet another thousand awful things, but to be honest, I’ve been trying to minimize the information I take in because it’s getting to be too much. I know we all have somewhat of a due diligence to be informed on what’s happening around the world and in our homes, but it is becoming too hard to deal with.

Now that my totally sunken, pessimistic rant is over (apologies for that), please tell me I’m not alone. How are you mitigating this if you are in the same boat? Trying to distract yourself?

You may be thinking that its because she’s actually worried about me and wants me to do better, but nope.

135,"So i (M/23) have studied for the past three years a range of subjects in Sweden. Initially i started off studying the masters programme in law (studied for three semesters before ending up quitting the programme) . I felt like i had to because even though the degree results in a stable job and some parts of the education was interesting, i felt dead inside everytime i tried to crack open the books. Afterwards i changed my programme to a candidate in Political Science (with the possibility of extending it towards a masters degree). I chose these programmes because my interests lie in history, politics, philosophy and geography.

This summer however the doubts that have been building up within me over the years finally took over. Whenever i thought about what to study i felt a huge amount of anxiety, because it felt like political science was an irresponsible degree to get. It contains several thrilling subjects and i truly enjoy it, but the job market afterwards seem hopeless. It's as though that expectation drives all the fun out of the assignments, because it feels as though they're on the way towards unemployment. Whenever i met strangers i would often tell them that i still study law or that i was studying courses, because i was ashamed of saying that i study political science.

Moreover this overall anxiety regarding the future oftentimes throws me in a downward spiral of self-loathing. I can get mad at myself for not being able to make a decision, that i am a privileged brat that gets to squander the best years of my life pondering which education will end up being the best one. It feels as though the ""walls are closing in"", that i'm not getting any younger and that ""not making a choice, is still making a choice"". I don't wanna be that person that has three previous educations in their baggage in their thirties, that still hang around at uni.

Beyond this problem i feel as though my life is good regarding exercise, hobbies, enjoying life, so i don't feel depressed. I have a network of friends and family that are supportive but i often times end up pushing them away when they ask me about my future. It simply feels as though whenever we try to talk about it everyone ends up describing the positives and negatives with every potential job, but without getting  any closer to a solution as to what i should do. The only one i find that i can speak truly freely about it is my psychologist.

So I was watching short films last night which was no big deal and ended up watching a pretty sad one about a girl who was terminally ill and chose to use self assisted and professionally administered euthanasia. This was a couple hours before sleeping. 

I went to sleep and everything was fine and I must have dreamt that I took the same medication as I saw in the film and I woke up at 2am, my heart beating, sweat everywhere in a complete panic attack. I felt myself going back to sleep and thought I was going to die and never wake up again, I have never been this afriad in my entire life and nothing has ever felt more real or scary (I have never, ever thought that a dream was real after waking up. I can always differentiate between reality and dreams, which is why this was so surreal). 

I can’t explain the feeling I felt which was a honest fear of death and I immediately called the police to bring me an ambulance, I told them that I felt the drug working and they needed to be quick so the guy on the phone started an abulance going to my house. I could barely even speak and was speaking so fast in a panic that they could barely understand me, and it wasn’t until he asked me exactly what happened and where I got the pills from that I looked around and realized that I had never ordered or bought these and that this entire situation wasn’t real and I had to get him to cancel the ambulance. 
This was extremely traumatic for me and I’m scared to go back to sleep tonight because of it. I can’t put into words the pure fear I was feeling and how real this felt.

142,"

I posted about my relationship of 2 years on another account and one of the comments said I needed to get examined for BPD ASAP. I am a highly anxious person and I go through periods of low self esteem. I've never self harmed,  felt suicidal, had casual sex, taken illegal drugs, don't overspend and don't drink alcohol, I'm a very cautious person, I plan everything I do. I do however, lack close friendships. I have a great relationship with my family but I find it hard to make good friends. I feel deeply ashamed of my lack of good friends since I was 14ish (21 now), I kinda assumed no one wanted to be my friend after years of bullying in school and I gave up on making friends I guess? I was very socially awkward. I think I was do scared of rejection again that I didn't wanna take the risk of building friendships. I made a few friends starting college but I met my BF within a few weeks and slowly lost touch with them. My new friends also hated my BF so it didn't help (we were nerdy, he is sweet and sporty but a bit lazy with college work). I didn't try make any new friends after that, now all I have is my BF and a few girls I text from college maybe once every 2 weeks.  My mental health has taken a serious hit from being in my hometown with no friends, no job and all day to feel anxious. I'm anxious 80% of the time, sometimes I get panic attacks. 

My relationship was amazing for a long time and I still love him. The issue is, he had a bad spell of what he thinks is OCD a year ago (and seems like it from what I've read and the online therapist I made him talk to). His OCD is largely the intrusive thought type. He confessed to some really horrible bad bad thoughts and said it was all OCD and it does seem like it. At some points this was everyday.  Some of it was even about me and made me cry. He got better from September to April/May and now is doing terribly. It never totally went away, but I feel responsible for making it worse by asking him to get real help and trying to trick him into admitting he is any of the bad things he worried about being, which is crazy manipulative if he does have OCD. I'm worried Im a psychopath because of it. I never meant to hurt him but I did and feel terrible about it and have apologised many times. I just wanted absolute certainty he wasn't incestuous/racist/a pedo and whatever else his OCD made him doubt. He eventually got mad and said he will to a doctor about it until he moves out and that I need to just accept he has OCD. I've stopped bothering him and asking for proof he has OCD (it makes him way worse). Do I sound like I have BPD?",28Aug2020,1
143,"I have a long history of mental health problems (depression, anxiety). I grew up in a very sexist house with 4 brothers and my parents, where my mom and I did everything and they did nothing. I didn’t have a childhood because I was busy ‘learning to be a woman’. 

Anyway, I got a boyfriend about 4 years ago. It’s a great relationship and he’s my biggest supporter; he’s taught me to be more confident and open. So, I’ve learnt to express things that hurt/offend me to my (pretty abusive) family. My mom is my best friend, hands down. I’ve seen her struggle in the house and she wanted more for me, but couldn’t speak. She was who I confided any feelings I had in, although I was limited in what I could say so I wouldn’t offend her.

Long story short, had a pretty big argument with my mom and I’m feeling crap. 4 years ago, we had a big argument and I said something that really hurt her. She’s brought it up several times and each time, I apologise. Today, I just couldn’t handle it. I had to let her know that she offended me during the argument then too and that I was sick of her bringing it up. It turned into a bigger argument and I told her it didn’t make sense that when she brought up her feelings, I had to apologise but when I brought up my feelings, I was “long winded” and “talk too much”. 

I’m feeling really crap right now and don’t want to self harm. I can’t talk to my partner either because he’s mourning the death of his sister who died 2 days ago. I feel alone and so guilty for hurting my mom, but also so alone for not being heard. I don’t want to self harm. Please help me :(",28Aug2020,1
144,"I don’t know who I am anymore. Am I insane? Am I depressed? Am I mentally unstable? Am I evil? Am I suicidal? Am I even still here? Am I having an existential crisis?

I don’t know who I am anymore. 2 months ago I felt like myself. I was depressed, but I still had my passion for science and wildlife, I felt emotionally stable, I felt mentally stable. I was sad over quarantine, but still able to enjoy things. I was very emotionally invested in things, I knew what I liked and disliked, I didn’t care if the things I liked had violent themes. I knew my limits for things. I felt like a human person. 

Now I don’t know anymore. It feels like I’m detached from everything. I keep having the urge to google my mental state, but I feel like I drove myself insane doing that. I got really existential inside my own mind and I’ve been questioning everything. I’ve been questioning what I liked and what o didn’t, what I was interested in and what I wasn’t, I feel like I’m getting no joy out of life, or maybe that I don’t deserve to? I have intrusive thoughts telling me I’m a bad or even evil person because I was into some messed up stuff. Now I can’t even really remember what that messed up stuff was and what I wasn’t into. I keep trying to remember my memories of before I felt this way, when I had a sense of humor, when I wasn’t constantly thinking about my own mental state, when I was sane. I don’t know if I’m sane anymore. 

I talk to my mom and my therapist nearly every day about this. I feel like I lost interest in everything and that I’m merely a facsimile of myself. Like I’m just going through the motion. I kept convincing myself I have all these mental disorders, and now I can’t recognize my own emotional state.

I feel separated from the rest of the world, I feel like my sense of humor is gone, I feel corrupted, I keep having intrusive thoughts about never being the same person again. I feel like I don’t know what to do or what to say. I am told that I have power over my own mind but I feel so weak mentally. I feel powerless against this. 

I feel like it’s gotten worse since I got back to school. I’m so full of regret, and feel like if I did more things to keep myself occupied instead of getting all introspective and psychoanalyzed myself, none of this would have ever happened. I feel. Like I want to go back in time and stop myself from making the huge mistake of googling my mental state. 

Now it feels like I lost everything. I feel like I can’t enjoy things or get engrossed or engaged in things, I feel like I broke myself mentally. I don’t know how I should act or behave, I feel depressed, impulsive, numb, sometimes I lash out, I feel like I keep forgetting things, I have this intrusive fear of becoming a serial murderer or something like that. I think googling my mental state made it worse. I still find myself online looking up depersonalization or intrusive thoughts or memory loss or lack of joy or emotional numbing or lack of personality. 

Right now I feel like I can’t do anything, but also that I can do anything, and for some reason that scares me. I feel like I am overthinking everything, that I lost my ability to feel love and empathy and emotions. I feel drawn to the things I used to fear. 

I feel like I am not trying hard enough to follow my therapist and my mom’s advice, like I don’t feel like I can do what they are telling me, that I should just let all this go and just enjoy life. I know they’re right, I just don’t know if I could even feel joy anymore. I keep analyzing myself and the world around me. It feels like the logical side of my head is doing what the emotional side did on instinct before. 

I feel like I keep making myself worse, like I keep ruining what should be the best time of my life. I don’t know who I am anymore, but I feel like the pieces are still here. Like I know who I was and who I’m supposed to be, but I don’t know how to be that person again. I don’t know what’s actually wrong with me and what I just convinced myself is wrong with me. I feel like I’m even worse now than I was last week, or two weeks ago. Like I’m deteriorating. 

And yet I don’t feel fully gone, the fact that I want to feel empathy proves I have empathy, the fact that I get so sad regarding not being able to feel things proves it’s possible. I know that all of this is bull and that it’s possible to fix myself back up, I just don’t know how. How to keep the intrusive thoughts at bay so I can try to enjoy myself, how to keep from overthinking everything so I can get back to feeling connected with the world. 

I feel like I keep going from hopeless to hopeful and back again, without making any progress, I keep expecting to get better right away. I feel like if I just focus on my school work I’ll eventually forget about this and just go back to my life, but I feel like I can’t get this wrongness out of my head, this idea that I’m wrong or the world is wrong or that nothing matters or that it’s too late for me or that intrusive thoughts have taken over my mind. 

I keep going from thinking that my therapist isn’t understanding me to realizing he’s right, that my mental state is only a problem because I’m telling myself it is. That I brainwashed myself with google and that if I just stopped I’ll be fine. But I can’t stop. I feel the need to fix a problem that probably doesn’t even exist.

145,"So we were eating dinner. It was a happy one, which is rare for our family. And then we got the call that our warehouse had burned down due to causes still unknown. My sister couldn't help but let out a few tears, because even though our stocks were insured, it's still a huge loss with or without the pandemic, and where I live (the Philippines), the economy's in shambles and a lot of people are suffering. Strangely, though, I felt nothing. Now I'm here sitting inside our car alternating between scrolling through Reddit and reading fanfiction while not far from me a lot of people-including my parents and sisters-watch as the firemen struggle valiantly to put out the fire. Even now, I don't feel anything. So now not only are all of our stocks gone, but it seems as if my emotions are, too. I just don't know what's wrong with me. Basically, the way I deal with grief is...I don't. I run away from it. I try not to think about it.

I’ve watched horror movies since I was like, I don’t know, 7 years old? My mom let me watch them, as she thought “well she knows it’s not real” and I actually genuinely enjoy horror movies and games now. I know they aren’t real, and are just meant to be entertainment. I know some girl isn’t gonna crawl out my tv and kill me in seven days. 

But, I’m now terrified of the dark, well more what’s *in* the dark. If I have to cut the light off and go upstairs, I full on book it up the stairs. Close my eyes to shampoo in the shower, I feel like the grudge girl is gonna be staring at me when I open my eyes. Getting up to go pee in the middle of night? Cut on my bedroom light, cut on the hallway light, cut on the bathroom light. Leave all the lights on, finish in the bathroom, cut that light off, run down the hallways and cut that light off, cut my bedroom light off then run to my bed and dive bomb it so I can get under the covers and be safe. 

Think locking me in a dark room is funny? Have fun dealing with my anxiety and anger when you let me out :) I literally had a mental breakdown at 17 because one of my friends locked me in her basement as a “joke” and I couldn’t find the light switch. Needless to say I’m not friends with her anymore (for other reasons too, but that’s another story)

148,"Hello I have decided to post this because during the one year that I have been visiting mental health related communities and websites, I have come across a lot of different approaches and methods which often contradict each other and others which seem just too generic or irrational.

Others just propose exercising and eating healthily. I have even had one person tell me to accept jesus. At this point, I don't even know what advice to follow.

I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for several years now and still working to get better. The thing is, recently it has gotten worse and I fell back in an old bad habit: self harming. I can talk to my friends about feeling sad, angry or things like that, but self harm has always been difficult for me to talk about. Only two of my friends now that I did it (I didn't tell them I relapsed). They are really sweet and supportive about it, but I feel like they don't understand it and don't really know what to say about it, apart from 'please don't do it'. And I can't blame them, I mean I'm happy they don't do it, but I can't really talk about it to them you know? I'm just looking for someone who understands my feeling and maybe likes to support each other on this topic. I'm just really struggling with it right now and don't know what to do...",28Aug2020,1

An example of this was a while back I saw my ex on a coworkers snapchat story, just seeing her just made me drop everything to try to do something. My mind would not slow down at all, and I had to find something to do to get the energy out. I measured this through typing tests, I usually get around 90-100 wpm, in that state my typing speed was at 120. 

It doesn't happen a lot, but if I see a certain trigger it certainly can happen. I don't know exactly why it happens, I  think it could be caused by my reaction to a load of adrenaline.",28Aug2020,1

155,"English isn't my first language so please be merciful with me; anyways recently I have started to notice how easily I lose my temper. I get angry over really small things and it worries me. I haven't broken things or hurt anyone fortunately. I don't want become an angry person like the most of my family. My oldest sister, my father and my older brother are always angry and very quick to anger, I can't really blame them considering what kind of childhood they had but I really hate it. 

**Backstory since you'll need it to understand me:** My mother has been mentally ill since I was a child, she used to be a bitter and angry person too. She has Psychosis, and all of us would fall prey to her anger. Sometimes she wouldn't recognise us. The most reoccurring thing was that she felt that dad was cheating on her, it was really bad. She'd accuse any woman she saw, even me and my elder sisters. She also hit us and was quite violent. My brothers always were doted by her but she still did get violent with them. She wouldn't take her medicines so she got worse but as of recently she was forced to a psychiatric ward, where they started giving her injections. They made her very calm, she doesn't raise her voice at us or accuse us of being with dad. 

She still hallucinates though, there's nothing we can do about that. I would say she is still a very bitter person, but much less than before. She smiles now, she didn't do that before. My father has to deal with her 24/7 as they share a room. Whenever we are alone, he always badmouths her or whenever mom calls him, he gets annoyed. She is still paranoid. On top of that she has diabetes and depression.

My father doesn't fare well in health either, he has heart problems as well as diabetes. He's an old man, constantly tired. My older brother is always an ass to him. Whenever the two are in the same room they start arguing over the smallest things. My brother is still resentful of the childhood he had and holds a grudge against him. I believe dad feels guilty as well because he does his best not to lash out at him. But since he can't lash out at him, me and other older sisters get yelled at instead. I try to stay quiet as he is my father but my sister, I have noticed gets really irritated whenever she hears dad and gets angry quick too but she always suppresses her anger, which I don't think is a good thing either.

 All of us repress a lot of our emotions, it's really not a good thing. I don't want my younger brother believe that showing vulnerable emotions is a bad thing.

Then there's my oldest sister, she doesn't live with us. She's works overseas and is dealing with depression and her own childhood trauma, just like my older brother, she's extremely resentful at our parents. Whenever I try to talk to her, somehow I manage to piss her off. We are not close though we both wouldn't admit it to each other.

We are not rich, we have financial problems. Since my older brother is a complete ass to dad and always starting fights with dad, he doesn't trust him with any of that so all of dad's problems fall on my older sister, she hears all of his stress, has to do all adult stuff for dad since he can't speak dutch (we live in belgium, hate it here) and she has university, she's having exams and of she fails she will be kicked out. Dad doesn't know that. He keeps stressing her out and shit. I can't even explain it all properly but our life is really shit.

I feel like a  burden, before corona started I stopped going to school because I was feeling like shit constantly. Everything was going the wrong way, grades were bad, my teachers demotivated me instead of helping me and everyone at home was always yelling, especially my mom. Dad was very angry with me because I couldn't tell him why I wouldn't go back. I didn't know either, I just hated everything. I stopped using my phone and my laptop. I did nothing but starve myself and think. I was miserable. I hated myself for bringing more problems and acting like a stupid kid.

And now, just when things seemed to be getting a bit better, my younger brother (15) got diagnosed with cancer, burkitt lymphoma. My father is unbelievably worried, my mother can't know because of how she is and my older brother doesn't seem to fucking understand how seriously ill our brother is. Since my sister was busy with exams, I stayed with my younger brother (he didn't want to see dad cry and dad isn't fluent in dutch, mom is ill, my sister has exams and my other sister is overseas). 

I have been staying with him almost since the start of his diagnosis. As you can imagine sleep wasn't an option for me, I had to help him at night, because moving hurt etc anyways I was tired and we were renovating our house and my older brother was helping at home. I finally am home after three weeks of not sleeping properly and taking care of brother, Finally convinced my brother to stay there the last week of summer because school starts soon and I am stressed to no end. I just hate it. I don't know how to explain it but I seriously need someone to hear me out. Nobody listens to me because I'm the second youngest.

I think I hate my brother? I don't really know, sometimes he an complete ass and other times he does nice things that make me feel bad for hating him. But I know one for sure I don't want to be like him. I have noticed that I get angry very quickly because of him and I hate it.

I really don't know what to do, I'm only 17; I can't think of any reason to live. I was going to kill myself before August but then my younger brother got cancer. I really don't want to live but I have to because my older sister needs me, she always gets to vent to me. Without me here, she can't bare all of this shit and younger brother needs me.

I don't know what to do, I really don't want to an angry person like the rest of my family. I hate it so much, what should I do? I digging deeper holes for myself and stay angry. I can't even cry. 

I really don't want to be an angry person but the smallest things trigger my anger. Sometimes I imagine hurting whoever made me angry. 

I have had thoughts like that ever since I can remember, there was a girl in elementary school who hated me for no reason. The kids were ruthless to me. Always whenever I think of her, I always imagine bad things happening to her and pray that she gets the karma she deserves.

Thoughts like that on other people I hate don't bother me but whenever I have such thoughts of my brother (mostly) I feel really bad afterwards and feel disgusted by myself because at the end of the day he is my brother and i am his sister, he does care for me.

What should I do to stop getting angry so easily?",28Aug2020,1

I’m a 21M in Victoria, Australia where we have been put back into lockdown for about 6 weeks now due to a second wave. I think I’m on the edge of a mental breakdown.

I’ve realised the past year I’ve put a blanket over 5 years of having a poor mental state with dedicating everything to MMA. That is my passion and the only time I am truely happy is when I’m in the gym. That blanket is gone and I’m faced with reality. 

I don’t know what to do with my career path. I love MMA and I hope to get a video editing job but the path to get there is not gonna give me a stable income. I feel stuck.
I hate my current job, I feel miserable there but I kept my feelings in because I should be grateful for still having a job. Last year I was able to push through because my dad got us in debt from his gambling addiction and I had to work hard for the family, I also knew at the end of the day I’ll be able to be stress free at my gym. Now we’re financially stable, there’s no gym to go to, my reasons that kept me pushing through my shitty stressful job are gone. I feel like I’m drowning because I’m scared to leave, and I feel like I’m being ungrateful for complaining that I have a job. 

I have trust issues with my dad, he broke my trust so many times I just can’t trust him anymore. Right now I feel like we’ve put a bandaid over our family issues because he was so stressed last year that he had a heart attack. He had surgery and came out well. This event put a clean slate on all his wrong doings. I’m on good terms with him but I still have some resentment. I’m scared once I let my guard down and I start to trust him, I’ll really get hurt. These family issues go so deep I can’t write it all here.

I feel like I have unresolved issues with my childhood friend’s suicide in 2018. I still feel like I’m keeping it in after all this time. I’ve cried but I refuse to let it all out, there’s no one I feel comfortable doing that with. I’ve spoken about it for the first time last year with a friend I could somewhat open up to, but even that I felt really reserved. I’ve always supported and said “if you need help ask for help”, I feel like a hypocrite. How do I ask for help if I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I feel like even when I ask for help, my feelings won’t change. I don’t want my family and friends to worry. I’m guessing this is what my friend felt before he killed him self. 

The only reason why I haven’t killed myself is because I’m scared and I’ve seen the damage and pain my friend caused. He probably inadvertently saved my life. I don’t want to kill myself, I have things I want to accomplish. But at the same time I want to fall asleep and not wake up. I’m in this limbo state where I won’t kill myself but I’m just so sick and tired of being tired. I feel like I’m drowning because I see myself as pussy for feeling this way, there are others that are going through worse things than me and I’m sitting here being dramatic.

161,"First time posting here. Maybe you guys can help?

My sister and I had a pretty traumatic childhood. I had a lot of mental health issues, and I have been going through treatment (therapy and medication) since I was about 12 (I am 20 now). My sister, however, kind of toughed it out and didn't show much emotion and never got any sort of therapy.

I've noticed for the past several years that she has been really into dieting/exercising. It was a really positive thing at first, but I feel like she has taken it overboard. I diet and exercise too, but it does not consume my everyday life like her. I cut myself slack and listen to my body.

My sister is 4'7 and in the 80 pound range. It might be a normal BMI because she's really short (she is in her late 20s). However, she is constantly talking about calories, losing weight, and working out. The behavior that concerns me is that she spends 1+ hours working out a day. Even on her 'rest days' I've seen her do high intensity workouts. She spends another hour stretching and rolling out her muscles because she feels a lot of pain. I've seen her look like she's about to throw up while working out, and she's told me she has a hard time breathing with the amount of weights she lifts. One time we were watching TV and she started doing cardio because she didn't feel good 'just sitting there.'

One time, she came up to me out of the blue and told me you can eat whatever you want as long as its in your caloric window. I was like yeah, maybe skip a snack so you can have dessert. She told me she was skipping breakfast so she could have a brownie later. This made me feel like she wasn't concerned about eating healthy but losing weight. It didn't sit well with me, and one time she told me she was having just coffee for breakfast even though I know it makes her stomach hurt to have it on an empty stomach.

She is constantly talking about calories. She says she only has 1200 a day... which means 400 per meal? This doesn't seem right, especially for someone who is already so skinny. In addition, she does 12,000 steps a day. I totally get dieting and exercising because I do too, but I've seen this affect her mental health. She is constantly talking about calories, how she's afraid to gain weight, how she feels fat after eating something small. It's almost like she has food anxiety.

166,"I was born into a Seven Day Adventist Church family. My mother heavily believed in it and my father believed in God and in scripture. As a kid, they raised me to fear God, to do what God wants to or else I’ll go to the bad place. They did a horrible job parenting. As a kid, I acted a bit queer. I came to my parents in total fear telling them that I’m scared I could be gay. I thought This because they told me and made me fear being gay, putting thoughts in my mind that “what if I’m gay? God wouldn’t love me. I would die and go to the bad place.” In respond, as any good parent would do, they yelled at me and sent me to see a therapist as a fucking child. I forget how old I was, maybe 9 or 10. I was scared and embarrassed. In order to ask for forgiveness. Every thing thing that would correlate to a “bad thought”, thinking about something gay, I closed my eyes and prayed to “my all loving god.” I started doing this many times a day, just to make me feel relieved each time I did. It grew and grew and now I felt the need to “pray” each time I stopped on a crack on a curve, I said a word with a different tone that I would have, i wasn’t sitting right, anything and everything I would feel I had to pray for forgiveness. Of course this was OCD that I got from the ideals of what my parents thought me. I still do this, but I don’t pray, I say someone’s name who I hold dear to me. It’s creepy but it helps. My parents made me think that any sexual thought weather straight or gay was a sin, so when I went through puberty of course my OCD sky rocketed. I became self aware though, so now I know all the lies and bullshit I was told. But the mental scares are still there. I don’t know what goes on in my brain. People have told me I could even have chronic Lyme disease which could be true, but I think that I just have a mental illness. I don’t know what. I don’t understand anything about myself mentally. But so many of my problems come from my childhood.

170,"Okay so I've had this sortve ongoing thought over the last 10 years that I couldnt really put words to.. without going into my own situation too much id just like to express how traumatic it can be spending time in a mental hospital/ward. 

When your taken there. Involuntarily. There is no other experience like it on the planet. It is a real life horror movie. Being in the midst of a full blown psychotic episode. Haulicinating. Being tricked into being taken there in the first place. Depending on how fucked you are  being thrown in High Dependency. No rights. Being housed with men and women. Either sex being able to walk in on you in the shower because its shared and you dont have the right to lock the door in case you try to top yourself . No nurses taking you seriously because your meds haven't kicked in yet.

And if you flip it you get jabbed in the ass. If you fuck up you have no phone rights. It is a mental prison. If you get slogged in the face or sexually abused.. until you actually complain about another patient nothing gets done about it. But your so fucked on meds are you sure whether it actually happened. 

Then your released. Maybe a bit too early. You leave and your meds still haven't leveled out. You try and tell close family and friends about it but they don't want to listen because you've just come out of the mad house and sound crazy.

Over the years you realise its easier to not bother tell anyone at all about it.. because they don't really want to hear it. They just react with yeah so and so went to Flynn.  They don't really want to relate. Its almost like your forever silenced. 

I dunno. This year will be the 9th year since being there ive come a long way. But man. Its almost like a thing no one wants to ever talk about.. unless they've been there. 

I consider this traumatic. I rarely feel like I can open up about it without a legit disappointed look. I struggle watching any movies revolved around mental wards.

176,"I am afraid of my mom. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s just her voice that I’m afraid of, but I’m afraid of her. I don’t know if I have social anxiety (and depression) because I haven’t actually been diagnosed but my mom, the nurse, and the therapist all think I do. It’s difficult for me to talk at all in front of my mom but I really hate talking about mental health and stuff with her. 

For example today she kept asking me questions during breakfast. It was really hard to answer because I just couldn’t make myself talk but I had to or she would just have me write it down afterwards. I ended up having to tell her that I was afraid of her even though I didn’t want to since she had told me before that I should be able to talk to her and that I shouldn’t be afraid. She kept asking more questions and I had to keep trying to tell her why even though I don’t even know the answers myself. I haven’t been able to do anything for the rest of the day. 

For some reason I feel really guilty and regret every time I have to talk about stuff like that with her. I wish I didn’t talk to her about it. Every time she says something that makes me realize that she knows stuff like that about me, I feel extremely bad. Once I overheard her talking on the phone with a nurse. She had said something to the nurse about how I had suicide thoughts but she didn’t think that I was planning to do it. I never told her about that and I didn’t want her to know. How much does she know about me that I don’t realize? I feel so guilty every time I remember that she knows that.

My mom always tells me “It doesn’t matter what other people think about you. It only matters what we think about you.” But what random people are saying about me barely affects me. It’s the things she says that affect me. I know I’m probably being over sensitive and I’m sorry if I am.",28Aug2020,1

181,"# What is Conflict?

Conflict is when one or more people are in disagreement with one another. Whether it’s how someone is handling a project at work or a friend that unintentionally offends them, they aren’t on the same page.

When people disagree, there are two reactions they can have:

* Ignore it
* Address it

How people handle the disagreement determines whether or not the conflict can be healthy. If the disagreement is small, then ignoring the conflict could work. But if resentment lingers and builds [Emotional Debt](https://heem.substack.com/p/introducing-heem-publication-and), it’s time for confrontation. Below are the four stages of healthy conflict and how you can navigate them.

# What is Healthy Conflict?

The four stages of having healthy conflict are:

1. Disagreement - When two people are in conflict
2. Confrontation - When the conflict is communicated
3. Discussion - When the conflict is discussed from both perspectives
4. Reconciliation - When a compromise is made

## Disagreement

In this first stage, it’s important to acknowledge and clarify the issue. Take some time to figure out what specifically is bugging you. It’s difficult to resolve conflict when you don’t know what the issue is. Be specific.

## Confrontation

This stage occurs when you approach and communicate the problem to the other person. The manner in which you confront someone is important. I’ve often found that confrontation works best when emotional levels are low. It’s also helpful to use “me” instead of “you” language.

For example:

&gt;“I was hurt when you said this.”

vs.

&gt;“You hurt me when you said this.”

Using “me” language frames the conversation in a way that isn’t looking to blame but instead focuses on expressing how an event affected you. This helps not to put the other person in a defensive position.

Also, be specific. This helps the other person understand what specific behavior offended you. Once you are both on the same page, you can figure out what the next steps are. In this way, specificity helps the conversation be productive because it’s easier to establish goals.

Here’s an example:

&gt;I feel like you don’t care about me.

vs.

&gt;I felt like you weren’t paying attention when I told you about my day during dinner. It made me feel like you didn’t care about me.

## Discussion

After you confront the person, it’s time to talk it out. The purpose of this stage isn’t to assign blame. It isn’t even to get an apology. The purpose of this stage is to hear each other out.

Here are some tips to help make the discussion productive:

* Listen - Give the other person a chance to talk. It can help prevent assumptions and any misunderstandings that may have occurred. It also helps you both get on the same page.
* Speak - Make sure your voice is heard. Take time to clearly communicate your feelings and your perspective of the situation.
* Be calm - Try to stay in control of your emotions and don’t act impulsively. This will help prevent the discussion from going out of control.

## Reconciliation

The keys to this final stage are establishing realistic goals, compromise, and letting go.

### Goals

By now, you’ve discussed the event(s) that triggered the conflict and both sides of the story. You’ve also been specific in the confrontation stage. Use that as a starting point to establish goals and to figure out what needs to change. Sometimes the goal can be as simple as an apology. Other times, it may require something more specific. Whatever it is, decide on it together.

For example, let’s say your partner never does the dishes. In the confrontation stage, you express to your partner that you are annoyed by this. However in the discussion stage you realize it’s not about the dishes, it’s about feeling unappreciated. You and your partner then brainstorm specific ways that would help you feel more recognized such as verbal affirmations and committing to do the dishes three times a week.

### Compromise

It is important for both parties to be open to meeting somewhere in the middle. Sometimes you may compromise a lot. Other times nothing at all. But always make sure you won’t resent what you decide afterwards. Having and communicating your non-negotiables in the discussion phase can help.

Observing whether someone is willing to compromise can also reveal a lot about the other person. If your partner never compromises, then that could be a sign they may not be the best partner. If they are hesitant, you may be touching on a deeper issue (such as a non-negotiable) that may require a deeper discussion.

### Letting Go

Once you reach a compromise and establish goals, it’s time to forgive and let go. Harboring resent will only build more Emotional Debt. Treat the end of the reconciliation stage as a new start and don’t hold onto bitterness or anger.

# More Helpful Tips

Here are some other helpful tips when attempting to engage in healthy conflict:

* Set realistic expectations. Make sure the goals you set and the expected outcome of the situation is reasonable. If it isn’t, you are simply setting the relationship up for failure.
* Understand that people have limitations. There are things they can and can’t do. Don’t set goals that you know the other person can’t achieve.
* Be willing to walk away. If what you need doesn’t match what they can give, it may be time to either put some distance or end the relationship.
* Not all conflict ends well. Despite the best of intentions, conflict may not always end in a healthy and reasonable way. Don’t let this discourage you. Instead, use it as an opportunity to learn and grow.

# Discussion Questions

* Did you have a recent conflict? How did it go?
* Apply the framework above. What could you have done differently?
* What were some of the non-negotiables you had?

184,"So this has been a tough year. My life hasn't been the easiest but ever since I was diagnosed with bipolar 5 years, it has been looking up. I was given seroquel and lithium.

&amp;#x200B;

I began college last year in the autumn and was working part time but when March came things took a turn for the worst. School was dismissed, then my mother lost her job a month later, then just two months ago the pandemic payment run out so we knew by September, we were living off savings and going to be homeless.

I'm not really worried about being homeless as there's a hostel which isn't too bad in my country as much as how I'm going to cope without medication. My doctor has given me the cheapest generic brand of seroquel/lithium but I can't afford it.

189,"This probably sounds messed up. I put ""in love"" in quotes cause I dont think it's actual love. Maybe more like in lust, or infatuated? 


He wasn't even a past boyfriend or anything which would make more sense. He was a complete stranger. He spiked me at the bar. I'm dumb and saw him a few weeks after and he spiked me again.

“Your brain is being silly, just ignore it” or “that’s your bipolar telling you that” or “don’t listen to those thoughts” are well-meaning comments but I find them frustrating. As someone living with chronic illness and mental health conditions, I do not get to separate me from my illness- it is a lived experience and I find those comments frustrating. 

To me, it’s like someone breaking their leg, and responding with “that’s just the pain receptors sending signals to your brain. you should ignore them, they’re silly”. What we do instead is we understand why the pain is occurring, help them fix it, and while they’re recovering we carry their bags at school when they’re on crutches, remind them to take their pain killers, bring them water and maybe meals, and help them self care so they can heal.

195,"I know my friends are tired of me always going through these. But at 21 I’m so tired of being controlled and the misogyny in this household kills me even more. If my dad says no then it’s a no. He never directly says it too. If I ask to go out with friends even to just meet up it’s a no. If I ask why he says how do they benefit you? It’s an unnecessary waste of money. Or that it’s dangerous outside. Or why don’t you go with the family instead?? I can’t even move out because I’m not financially stable and still a student. I have no family either. 

Today I wanted to go get a haircut and asked for money. Usually I work in the summer so don’t have to ask them but this summer I was banned from going outside. So I haven’t been outside without their supervision for 6 months straight now. Even corner shops, I’d get a call within 5 mins or even less. Most of the times my dad will do these instead or my younger sister. She’s been out with her friends though. I don’t know what I’ve done for this to happen. She’s never worked like I have. She did one summer but that was it and didn’t even last and quit her job because the pressure of it while studying was “too much”. Whereas, I’d been suicidal, gone through so much trauma, ptsd, clinical depression, failing my education and having to repeat the year because of all my suicide attempts, and have been working on the side to stay away from home as much as I can. 

I just feel numb now. Today I asked for money for a haircut. My first one in 6 months too. I’d been in uni before that so I could do whatever there. And I got told if my dad doesn’t drop me off I can’t go. The shop is literally behind the house. I got irritated. Because the hypocrisy here is deafening. The reason being i can’t catch corona if my dad is with me??!! BUT they eat out??!! Apparently they can’t catch corona by eating restaurant food. They’ve booked house viewings??! Apparently going to other people’s house to view them wnt give them corona. But me stepping on to a bus or god forbid step outside without supervision will give me corona. I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE. I had a mental breakdown and BUTCHERED my hair. And I feel even more shitty. I picked up the scissors to harm myself but ended up doing this to myself. I feel kinda numb now tho. Like I’ve been writing goodbye letters to ppl and have sent goodbye texts. Half of them think it’s a joke and half say it’ll get better but only I know.

I feel numb and know that this is different to all those times I’ve done it before. This time I’m too numb to care and dnt give a fuck about anything. I just want ppl to know STOP FUCKING BIRTHING CHILDREN AND TREATING THEM LIKE FUCKING PROPERTY!!!!!! If you think you’re mentally unstable STOP GIVING BIRTH!!! You’re NOT fit to look after another human being. STOP THIS FUCKED UP CYCLE. If your parents did something to you just know you’ve been affected and sometimes EVEN WITH therapy those affected sides of you COME OUT!!!!!!! AND YOU WILL FUCK UP YOUR CHILD!!! In worst case scenarios killing them off. I’m hoping to die on my birthday. Which is very very soon. And when I die I will have the last laugh and have full control. When I pass away I do not want my parents or siblings to see me and I want my body to be donated or cremated or even fed to maggots I dnt care. But I dnt want my family to have the satisfaction of seeing me or saying goodbye. They don’t deserve it at all. They made me go through so much. And I want them to suffer with every breath that they take and know that they drove me to my death by being them. I hope they know what pieces of shit and manipulative and emotional and physical abusers they are and die a miserable fucking life. I hate them to the core and although I appreciate all that they’ve done for me I think the misery they put me through cancels out the good. Because I’ve suffered half the life I’ve lived with them. And only didn’t suffer the first half much because I was too young to acknowledge the shit I was going through properly. Like right now I feel extremely insane. I want to have a panic attack or release whatever shitty thing is in me but tears wnt even come out lol. No tears. No panic. No hurt. Just a wanting to stop and leave for good. 

If someone read through all of it. I’m sorry you had to read all the hate. I’m genuinely a nice person who’s just gone insane. I hope your day was good and for whatever reason you’re on this thread I hope you will find the light soon. If there’s a god and I meet them I’ll genuinely ask for y’all peace.

She told me several days ago that today she would go to a boxes of food early in the morning. Like I said, I have become forgetful lately that I forgot the specifics about today. So I asked several questions. She got fed up. She went off, told me that she already told me about what she was gonna do, even told me that my brain isn't working properly, that the cells are failing or whatever. I don't remember her exact words. All I know is that I was insulted. By my own mother.

You shouldn't have said that mom. You fucked up. You know you did. I will tell you straight to your face that you fucked up. I went to my room to take a breather. I went back downstairs. I told her that she shouldn't have said that at all. So uncalled for. I can't imagine a situation where it is okay to tell a person that your brain isn't working. When in fact, it is working. It is working overtime. It is processing so much information that some of it will be forgotten. I told her that my mental health has not been okay ever since the pandemic and the stay at home orders were initiated. I told her that I KNOW that I've been forgetful lately and that my mental health isn't the best, that this mental health crisis is national, maybe even worldwide. I told her that I know all these things and that I don't need a reminder.

She felt bad. Even teared up. Good. I want you to recognize that you fucked up mom. I love you and I forgive you. Please watch what you say. I will never forget this.

I felt like I needed to vent and I feel better now. I feel like I'm finally getting through to my parents. It is not easy explaining to them why people hate cops, why they hate justice system, why people protest, why there are few people looting, which isn't the sole purpose behind the protest. People are upset. People want justice. We will not get it by being quiet, by acting peacefully, by praying or keeping those in our thoughts. Fuck all that. But they insist that people are crazy. My parents are just stuck in their thick headed conservative skulls. It is not easy. But I will continue to educate them, continue to have these angry and uncomfortable conversations. My generation will not be silent. We will fucking change shit up, in whatever shape of form. For ourselves, for my younger siblings, for my future children.",28Aug2020,1
201,"Okay, a little information: I don't think my family takes mental health very seriously and I am not old enough to consult a doctor myself. Nor do I know much about mental health myself. Hence this post

Basically over the past 2 years or so I've been experiencing symptoms of I don't know what. Please help me to identify it as I think this is getting out of hand.

I am always VERY scared. Of everything. If an airplane is flying over my house, I'm scared it will fall on us( I live near an airport so this is a constant fear), if a loved one doesn't pick his/her calls on the first ring, I'm become absolutely sure that something bad has happened to them

We use bottled LPG cylinders for cooking, and I'm scared of the freak leaking accidents associated with it. I am ABSOLUTELY terrified of fires because of faulty wiring (this one's a little rational because we've had some run ins with this particular issue in the past) but even then it's extraordinary as even if there's a slight fluctuation in the electricity, I start running out of the house.

Before I go to sleep, I have this constant fear that what if there's an earthquake while I'm asleep and I'm not able to get up.
My family is pretty loud in general but whenever I hear loud noises from any part of the house I rush there thinking an intruder has broken in(this is a particular fear)/Something terrible has happened, but it's mostly just my family being their loud selves.

Also, whenever I get a call I get scared thinking it's bad news. Basically my mind is just constantly waiting for a bad thing to happen.

Is this serious? I'm a little worried because this constant fear has started interfering with routinely activities. Please help. Any advice would be appreciated.",28Aug2020,1

203,This isn't a hate post or anything. But dealing with loving attention from your significant other can be hard because you have to except the fact sometimes that you won't be put first everytime. Maybe it works that way in the beginning but things always change. You may send a text and your significant other has been on Facebook and not opened your messages. Or opened someone else's message first. Maybe you had a problem with something thats going on but they will do what they want either way. Trust and a sense of self is very important and just because you're not first pick at certain things doesn't mean that you aren't first pick at the end of the day or even maybe at the end of life. Accepting that your significant other needs to pick over you once in a while is very healthy for both people and for the relationship in general. It doesn't mean you aren't loved or not wanted. Ive dealt with thsse feelings before too.,28Aug2020,1
204,"Hi, I really don't know if this is the right sub for this, but I just came across the question ""What would you do if you didn't play an instrument"" (I play viola and piano) and well ... I would have probably killed myself. I have been not well for years, if I feel really bad, I would just start crying if I stopped busing myself, because my head was just empty, it was all just a big empty, hopeless darkness, that made me unable to function. In those moments, if I had to choose to live another day, or die, I would choose death, because, I felt like i couldn't bear it any longer. And whenever that happened, I would practice for hours, to fill this hole, because playing music made me happy and gave me a goal, just a tiny thing like practice that run, or get that vibrato right, to keep going. Playing with other people is the only time when I have got enough energy to smile without a reason, because I am just happy... So to get to a point, music saved my life, and still does that if I am honest, and  I just wanted to share that with someone.",28Aug2020,1

206,"So I’ve been taking with a psychologist for about  6 weeks now. He really thinks that I could benefit from meds for my anxiety and my depression so got me to set up an appointment with a psychiatrists. Maybe it’s the anxiety talking but I’m really scared I’m gonna screw that up somehow. I know I have social and generalized anxiety, both me and the psychologist agree. And I also have extreme mood swings that are a problem as well. And I’m in grad school, in a program that requires tons of public speaking, which I would have been able to handle at some point in my life, but right now I feel so fragile and scared and I feel that is gonna be a huge issue for me this semester. I don’t know how to communicate all of this in an hour so that he knows how much these issues are affecting me. I feel like he is going to say “everybody gets stage fright” or something. Idek what I want from this post, sorry guys. My head is all over the place. I guess some inside of how the first session usually goes? How do you even start? Should I bring a list of my symptoms? Thanks before hand.",28Aug2020,1
207,"The issue is that she has a tendency to be very negative and pessimistic about things. She often worries about not having enough time to get things done (work obligations and/or school obligations), as well as being very sensitive to things other people say that she may take negatively. I have been very supportive of her and have given her lots of encouragement, reassurance, and been a listening ear for her when she needed to vent. I've also provided her great advice more than once that has helped lessen some of her work burdens. Despite all that I do to bring her up, it feels like she is determined to stay down. 

This is very tricky for me because I feel like when it comes to mental health, it's at least somewhat related to willpower. (I am diagnosed with ADHD, severe anxiety) Meaning you have to compel yourself to start feeling better and positive - you have to take steps to elevate your mind state. Drugs aren't going to just magically perfect the neurotransmitters in your brain that are responsible for mood. You've got to consciously take actions to help yourself, and the medication is supposed to be sort of a crutch to lean on in order to help you do that. How do I approach my friend and tell her I feel like she isn't putting enough effort into improving her mentality? Almost every day she has something to complain about or she's in a bad mood, and I really care about this person, but as someone who started SSRI treatment &amp; has been titrating over the past two months, I've been experiencing some fluctuations with my own mental health &amp; it's hard to have such a negative presence in my life. I don't want it to seem like I'm downplaying her depression or anxiety because I'm not, but I do think she needs to put more effort into being a big girl and taking care of herself rather than making the excuse that her inability to do so is due to her mental disorder(s).

211,"TLDR: 23[M] - Since my Childhood I’ve been dealing with attention issues that remained. I developed mood related problems in high school which did not get better. In the past 2 years I started hitting myself and having suicidal thoughts. I’m going to visit a psychiatrist but I dont know what to expect

So I’m 23 and Im going to visit a Mental health professional the first time but I dont know what to expect. 

Since age 7 or earlier I’ve been having attention problems. I get distracted at everythig: my job (regular office job) or at school, or even when I’m watching a movie. I also forget everything. Appointments, details, what I wanted to do minutes ago. If I focus for an extended period of time (like in my german classes) I feel really exhausted for hours. This has caused issues at all of my Jobs. 

My dad passed when i was going to highschool. My HS years were really depressing. I didn’t want to do anything, I didnt really socialize, I literally didnt go to parties and i rarely hanged out with anybody. I felt like nobody loved me, and i felt very sad all the time. This has got better overtime, but i still feel sad and its still hard for me to socialize. I also procrastinate even basic tasks in all territories of my life. 

Also since age 7-10(or earlier); I’ve been having imaginary conversations in my head. I wouldn’t call this “hearing voices”. It’s more like outplaying possible situations in my head. Like when i was walking home from school I would imagine my teacher asking me about the contents of that days lecture, and me giving answers to them. Or if I had job interview/date/conflict i would imagine what questions the other person may ask me when i’m with them,and what answers I would give to said questions. This only happens when I’m alone and not focused, but it’s pretty common. 

Recent self harm issues: In the past 2 years i developped self harm and anger problems. This happened while my jobs became more and more stressful. When I think of something that embarrassing or cringe I did - like being scolded in school by the teacher, or messing up something at work - I punch myself in my leg, arm, or face in an almost involuntary way. Like I think about how I fucked up at school and I hit myself as a reflex. It also happens after conflicts. I got into an argument with my mother today and after that I started  hitting my arm and stabbing myself with a pencil. I also imagined screaming at her. I also felt extremely angry, I felt pressure in my chest, I felt very overwhelmed. 
I also think about killing myself. I do not make plans or really consider doing it. I do imagine the act of it, and i feel as if it was better if i wasn’t alive. This happens usually when I’m under sudden stress. 

I believe I have some sort of attention deficit problems that needs medication. I’m also concerned about the imaginary convo and self harm thing. Is it possible that I have schizophrenia? When I visit my mental health doctor what should I expect? What is the most likely diagnosis for those two problems? And what would the screening and treatment look like? I’m sorry for the lenghty post but I feel really lost and I have nobody to tell this. 

Note: English isn’t my native language, but I hope i was able to describe the problems clearly. Thanks.",28Aug2020,1

225,"i am currently a 20 yo female with a history of mental health problems. 

for background: i was diagnosed with anxiety at 8 yo which was absolutely debilitating for someone my age. i was then diagnosed with depression and hypersomnia at 16. finally i was diagnosed with ptsd, adhd, and social anxiety (under the umbrella term of GAD) by 19. my therapist also suspects that i could have bipolar II disorder but that hasn’t been looked into. 

i have been through four psychiatrists/nurse practitioners, two therapists, and a whole bunch of meds. i’ve had one suicide attempt. i’ve been on serafem, prozac, lexapro, zoloft, cymbalta, wellbutrin, klonopin, strattera, vyvanse, and ritalin from the time i was 16 until i was almost 20. i am currently on effexor and adderall. (if u have any questions about those meds pls ask ^^). i have been with my current therapist for almost a year-and-a-half  where we’ve been working through my trauma with CBT and art therapy. so i have sought help. 

i have a boyfriend (23) and we’ve been together for three years at the end of september. we’re very happy with each other and we plan on getting married and starting a family together. 

but he has debilitating ocd along with other undiagnosed mental health problems. his ocd is associated with “bad luck” and once something brings him “bad luck”, it cannot be touched or even mentioned again. if he feels like something bad is going to happen, he washes his hands, not scrubbing, but running them under water. he constantly feels like he needs to change his clothes if they’re “bad luck”. this causes our laundry basket to get piled up and messy. if something is a minor inconvenience to him, he begins the world is out to get him and becomes violently angry. 

he, however, refuses to get help. but that’s not the point. 

my mom revealed to me that her side of the family suffers from depression and anxiety and probably adhd, meaning that my depression and anxiety were inherited biologically. my father also has untreated mental health issues with GAD and depression. 

physically, the paternal side of my family has a history of diabetes, cancers, and heart problems. both paternal grandparents had/have diabetes and both had/have triple bypasses. my maternal side has histories of various cancers including breast and skin and high blood pressure. 

my bf’s cause for his mental illness is unknown. i don’t know if he was traumatized as a small child as he is very selective about his memory or if it was passed down biologically by his biological grandparents, who we know nothing about bc his father was adopted and doesn’t want to know out of respect of his adoptive parents. i believe that his family has a history of heart problems and diabetes as well. 

because of all these factors, i’m hesitant about bringing a child into this world. they have too high of odds of developing debilitating mental and physical illnesses that will give them an unfair shot at life. am i being selfish for thinking like this? is this type of thinking considered eugenics because i don’t want my children to have the chance of inheriting mental illnesses and physical illnesses?",28Aug2020,1
226,"So, it's hard to explain how I feel, but, I always feel like two people in the same time.
I am phisically in reality but hardly paying attention and my brain is thinking smth else (mostly scenarios).
It's like I am in a place, but my brain isn't, so I end up messing up smth, forgeting stuff, forgeting something someone just told me, etc.

I think it comes from a place of boredom cause I grew up in a village, I had very few friends and my brother was at home maybe once every 2 weeks (He's more like a parental figure to me since he's 13 yrs older than me), so I was alone for s lot of time. Perhaps this boredom made me retreat into my imagination and f.cked me up.
The only ""friends"" I had growing up were 3 of my cousins and a girl who barely has time. Most people here are boring and basic af and we found nothing in common.

   However, I started high-school (and had to use to bus to go to the town, obviously) where I finally met people whose only subjects of discussion aren't just football (soccer), lifestock and trying to be ""cooler"":D. 

Although I have much more friends now, the problem is that I can't hang with them as much as I'd wish (my village is far and gas costs a lot of money here), especially now with the coronavirus.

My condition still causes problems tho, making me sometimes socially unaware, anying, forgeting I said the same story twice, etc. and it's rly anoying.

Another thing is that, whenever I get happy, I tend to mess smth up and be embarassed for the rest of my life for it (luckily, my memory is sh't), it's like if I lose my emotional controle and become unaware, hence why I really hate being happy...part of me is still aware, however it's like my body is controled.

One morning this year, I couldn't step back into imagination anymore, I essentially woke up (and realise how boring life is for normal ppl, like Jesus Christ aren't y'all thinking abt fighting someone with magic during the class?), I felt so liberated and so good.

227,"From the beginning

For as long as I can remember, I’ve had a gross and somewhat violent sexual fetish, and would fantasize about it sometimes, before moving on with the rest of my life. It didn’t really bother me, it wasn’t constantly on my mind, but it did make me a little uncomfortable with myself afterwards. Also, the thought of doing anything like that in real life was utterly terrifying, plus I was also into more “traditional” stuff so it didn’t really matter. 

I could worry and think about other stuff to the point of pretty much forgetting about that dark and gross side of myself. I could think about other things like videogames, movies, comic books, animals, science, my friends and family, etc. It was just another part of me that I didn’t really think about all that much. I was also really empathetic towards animals but was still able to watch nature shows where they fought and hunted eachother and stuff because that’s just how nature is. And I was also still able to play videogames where you fight things. 

In college especially, I felt like I was really growing as a person. I had a strong and supportive group of friends, I was trying all sorts of cool new things, I felt like I was truly coming out of my introverted shell. I also found myself in that dark space less often. Like I still engaged with it, but not nearly as much as when I was younger. Also I sort of branched out when it came to the ...stuff I was into, and I guess that sort of diluted(?) the darker stuff. Instead I focused more on the other things I liked. I focused on improving my art, on continuing to study, on goofing off with my friends, with getting really into all sorts of shows and movies and getting really emotionally invested in them, getting better at certain games, improving the stories and comics I was working on and being emotionally attached to the characters in my head. I even got a bit into politics (although not really). I even had a crush on one of my friends and telling her how I felt was the most in the moment and terrifying thing I ever felt. After doing so I felt so much better, even though she turned me down, she was graduating after all. I became a lot more comfortable with myself and those around me. I wasn’t perfect by any means, I had intrusive thoughts from time to time, paranoia about being sick sometimes, and random bouts of depression from not being able to help my friends the way they helped me. But I did feel like I grew as a person. 

When COVID hit and we were all kicked out of the dorms, I stayed with a friend. We couldn’t really do much, and let’s just say his parents had certain political beliefs that didn’t exactly line up with ours. I felt very in touch with reality back then though. I was still pretty depressed over the fact that the girl I liked didn’t like me back, but more so because I felt like a bad friend for continuing to have a crush on her even afterwards. 

After I finally got back home, I was feeling a bit better. I got a new computer and a drawing tablet, and played all sorts of games online with my friends. I also got really into reading webcomics. Especially romantic ones and action ones. I could really relate and empathize with the characters, and some of them inspired me to create stories of my own. I had all sorts of fantasies in my head, from space travel fantasies, to ones about finding a significant other in all sorts of cliche ways, to thinking about how certain characters would interact with eachother, to rewriting certain stories because I didn’t like the ending, etc. I even visited my home friends for some socially distanced fun.

But something happened around early July. I was more irritable, I started getting more depressed. I felt less motivated, I haven’t talked to my friends in a while, my mom kept watching the same reruns of the same shows over and over, I got bored of playing the same games and wasn’t motivated to try anything else. I kept procrastinating on my drawing because I wasn’t motivated. Also the controllers on my videogame system weren’t working. Also it was a pretty slow time for new videogame information, I had caught up on the webcomics I was reading and could no longer binge, I didn’t feel like starting any new shows on Netflix, and I was also worried that not all of my friends would be back in the fall as online classes made coming to campus less necessary. I found myself engaging in more pornography than usual (again, bored adolescent). I also found myself less able to... get aroused. I didn’t really acknowledge the problem that much, but since I was bored and lacked motivation to do anything else, I looked it up. This was the start of the big problem. 

According to google, porn addiction can cause that problem (depression can too, and I should have just accepted that I was depressed and moved on), and I did find that I was still able to be attracted to the more fetishy stuff. I decided to just wait until I went up to school again, when I could see my friends and be distracted by other stuff to seek help for that problem. I finally got to talk to my college friends over videochat and we even played a drinking game (the second time in my life I had alcohol, after a drink on my 21st birthday 2 months prior). The day after that my head felt really clear for some reason. I was also browsing reddit’s news feed when I came across an article about porn related impotence again. I decided that I’d go cold turkey and stop altogether. I felt really proud of myself for doing that, although I think I made my second big mistake: I googled porn addiction withdrawal. I only looked it up to prepare myself for what was to come, but I think that only put ideas into my head. 

For the first week or so I was fine I guess. I was able to still fantasize and read comics and think about other stuff, although when I did notice something sexual, I started to feel a bit uncomfortable, which was not really a problem for me before. I started to see some things differently, as if the whole word was gross and fetishy. My mom also watched a lot of adult TV, and there was a lot of sexual humor in that which made me uncomfortable when it didn’t before. I also noticed I was a bit more depressed than usual and a bit more out of it, although I could have just been the same amount of depressed as before. My mom noticed how depressed I was and decided to give my therapist a call. I spoke to my therapist about all of the reasons why I was feeling depressed, including the porn and being aroused by gross and dark stuff. That was the first time I ever actually spoke about it out loud. Which I think caused me to start thinking about it a bit differently. The fact that he said it was perfectly okay to be into that kind of stuff as long as I didn’t do anything bad in real life or do it too often, made me feel somewhat uncomfortable. It made me think about what was okay vs what wasn’t. I started to get stuck in my own head over this dilemma. I felt even more distant from everything. The dilemma inside myself was made even worse when I told my mom about the darker stuff I looked at and she said she was proud of me for deciding to stop, which only made me more confused, since my intentions weren’t exactly pure (I only did it to become more aroused by regular stuff). I started dissociating even more, and couldn’t focus or get engaged in the things I used to really like and enjoy.",28Aug2020,1

230,"Picture an extreme case: someone who literally can't cook, clean. Has no regular routines or reliable habits for feeding self, house chores, getting up and sleeping at a certain time, or even things like showering, brushing teeth. So you can imagine how ""stuck"" that would leave things. ^((Please don't assume anything about me, I just think a dramatic case is easiest to demonstrate what I mean))

I'm looking for a guide book including a process for someone like this, even that stuck, to challenge themselves to integrate habits (""learn to live"") one small step at a time. Conquer this, then enter the next stage after the previous achievement is met. In ways that targets one thing at a time and discourages backsliding.

Anything like that out there?!",28Aug2020,1
231,"I had a realisation about how much of a bitter and angry man have i become. I still remember a drinking buddy telling me how much of an idealist i am and how i still believe in people and goodness. Well, this all went to shit. Over the last few years everything i ever believed in has been crushed. I got into some personall problems that caused me grief but when i reached out to people for help they just dismissed it. Told me it will get better, i'm an awesome guy, it's all just in my head, i'm in for a great time. Well i wasn't in for a great time. I lost most of my friends who have forgotten about me. I don't know if they ever cared about me in the first place. None of my problems fixed itself i was just more alone with them. And more problems came instead. I lost my job after a short time. I failed at my dream of being an actor since they quickly stopped contacting me. No job, no friends, no girlfriend, no nothing. Then i met lady who fancied herself a therapist and offered to ""help me"". It ended with a one month non stop session of invalidation, guilt tripping, insults and accusations. I left it a broken mess. Still nothing fixed itself. Then i failed at acting again. Then two ladies broke my heart in very cruel ways. And when i tried to befriend new people they ""were busy"". Then people ghosted me on my birthday. Then COVID hit. I used to realy idolize the USA as a sort of promised land where one day i will start a new life free of all sorrows. I knew i was romanticising it but it gave me comfort (plus in all honesty i genuenly enjoyed American culture and landscapes so there were real things for me to experience). Then the riots happened and something in me died. The only thing still keeping me at my senses was my love towards one woman but alas it didn't work out either. No cruel heartbreaks this time at least, it went rather peacfully and we're still friends but at that moment the last positive spark in me was gone. There is just nothing in me anymore. I'm just a giant ball of pent up rage and frustration waiting to tell everyone about how much life screwed me over, snapping at them for invalidating me/reminding me of therapist lady, and seeing therpist lady and people like her as the root of all evil (as you might have guessed i despise therapist lady). The only person who supported me through all of this was my father. Only he understood me. And now i just don't know what to do. I'm so full of anger over all of this and towards all of them. And there come moments where i see i'm on a road to nowhere, that this anger is going to kill me and that i should let go. But then i hear in my head to ""just chill the fuck out"" like therapist lady used to say and i refuse to let go. They told me there is no need to worry about problems like mine. They told me i should just focus on something else. They told me all this stress is unjustified since all is a mild incovenience at worst. And i refuse because i will never let them invalidate me again. And here i am not knowing what to do. Continuing on a self destructive path of hate. Or maybe wounding my already damaged pride even more and admitting they were right. And i don't know what then. My spite towards them and stubbornly refusing to let go was the only thing keeping me going for all those years.",28Aug2020,1

233,"Hello!

I'm a disabled woman and I work in mental health peer support. I'm starting a new organization to hopefully provide more peer support in my area. We'll mostly offer groups and workshops aimed at supporting each other and learning new coping and recovery skills. I hope that describes it well enough. :/ 

Any way, I have a few chronic illness that have been slowly limiting my mobility, and I now switch between a cane and a powerchair. As a result, I've ""suddenly"" noticed a lot of accessibility issues that I had the privilege to ignore before.

I am creating the accessibility and inclusion policies for my org now, and I want to make sure that I don't have accessibility blindspots. If there are things that you've found to often be forgotten/missed/ignored or things that would make accessing groups and workshops more feasible or easy, please let me know!!! Here is what I'm including so far:

* Every ad/publication for our services will include information on accessibility and invite people to ask for the accommodations they need if we don't have them.
* The location of our groups will be fully wheelchair/walker/mobility accessible and advertised as such.
* Any videos that we show will be open captioned and described video versions will be provided as needed.
* Handouts and slides will have audio and large print versions readily available.
* We will be service animal positive and help make sure that other participants are respecting service animal etiquette.
* We're an intersectional feminist organization, so we do not accept the use of slurs / hate speech or discrimination towards any identities.

If there is anything I am missing or anything that would be helpful to add, please let me know!!",28Aug2020,1

I will say things like ‘if I’m failing this class in 2 months time I will end it all’ or ‘if I’m still single in a year that will mean it’s my time’.

235,"English is not my first language, apologies for any grammatical errors.

Me and my friend are in the same Class in school since three years. He‘s 17, I’m 19. He always struck me as a cynical bastard, but in a quite funny self deprecated way, he appeared, now even more, that nothing really mattered to him.In retrospect the signs were always there but worsened since the pandemic. 

The signs are in short; he almost throws up if we force him to eat more than a piece of bread, he lost interest in most of his previews hobbies, he comes to school with rings under his eyes and I sometimes see his IG info stating he must habe been up until 5am on a Weekday (school starts around seven), he only talks about emotions especially his sardonically. Whenever I or anyone else tries to talk more seriously about things of an emotional nature he deters or evades the conversation. At times he doesn’t talk at all for one or two days straight and looks like a zombie, deadeyed, his body seemingly on autopilot. I only see him smile if a kid falls from its bike or when he‘s high. We live in switzerland where even bigger cities are manageable in terms of their size. I sometimes catch him at night on Weekends wandering around for hours chain smoking with a deadpan expression in his face. I know for a fact that he‘s suffering from ADHS if thats any help...

it might seem as if he‘s an total douche yet if you manage to get through to him, usually with the help of alcohol he can be one of the sweetest people I know.

Like I don’t act enthusiastic enough, sometimes I’m rude without realizing it, Ive been told I needed to dress nicer.

239,"I've recently realised that whenever I've gotten a coping mechanism that is even remotely linked to a physical action, or found a comfort item, I've actively rejected it and stopped doing it. I've literally taken painstaking efforts to stop it at the cost of my own mental health.

I think it was the way people looked at me at first. I've always been a bit repulsive but when I would do a comfort action- people look at you like they hate you, even if they've never met you. They look at you like you deserve to die. And to be fair, I've been followed home for it too so that threat is somewhat real to me. 

But if I found clothes that i found comforting, something that I was attached to in a way that wasnt perfectly normal, I'd never wear it again. Even if it helped my massive anxiety problem. Because it's not normal to be attached to clothing. Its downright freakish to react strongly if other people touch it or you. And its grotesque if it doesnt fit into the realm of normal fashion.

I hate it when people touch me. I'm fine if I initiate contact but if they do? It makes my skin crawl. But I've learnt the hard way that people react badly if you ask them to stop making you uncomfortable. So I let people be touchy feely with me. I've had stims and clothes that would help with it in the past, but as I've already stated I've painstakingly destroyed every safe space I've ever had. 

My mental health has been a burden to my family. They've never had time to deal with me and I could tell it annoyed them to be forced to when i got a panic attack. When I have one I'm too loud to be ignored because of their sensory issues. I feel bad tbh, they had bigger things to worry about. 

It doesnt help that I caused my own bad mental health somewhat.

I'm beginning to think I'm autistic. I dont care to be diagnosed- it took me 9 years to get diagnosed with dyslexia never mind autism, its really not worth the effort when I know, where I live, it would take longer. But it would explain a lot. I wish I'd been an easier child to deal with. I feel like I've ruined my parents lives. 

I hate the online autistic community. I hate the online disabled community. Nuerotypical disabled people think they are gods of all things neurodivergent, and neurodivergent people actively refuse to believe any experience outside of their own is legitimate. 

I hate the mental illness online community. Its unaccepting, and full of bad habits. You'd think a community dedicated to mental health would understand that turning mental illness into a competition is a bad thing, but youd think wrong.

I feel like I can never be part of those communities. I feel like they'd make things worse. But I dont have anyone I can talk to about these things, and I've been lonely for as long as I can remember. I feel like I'm yet again making my own mental health worse and down the line, I'll hate myself for it.",28Aug2020,1
241,"Somebody I know recently lost their husband at a young age, unexpectedly. Late 40s. She contacted her psychiatrist for an emergency appointment. They prescribed celexa but it takes 4-6 weeks. She’s at her breaking point now, not sleeping, awful. She asked her psychiatrist for help. 

He told her “if you miss him, hug a pillow and realize it’s the circle of life.” What the hell? I have half a mind to make a complaint. Her mental health is bad and these people won’t help. What do we do? How can I help?",28Aug2020,1

I always had this weird memory of me being in my cousins treehouse and him touching me. I was around 4 years old and he was 14. I don‘t remember much from it but for 16 years I always thought it wasn‘t real. Or that it wasn’t a big deal at least.
Talked with my mom last week, we had a discussion about how i often jokingly say that i hate men and she thinks it‘s because of my dad (bc he cheated on my mom) and my cousin. 
It hit me in that moment. there was a HUGE fight at that time between my parents and my cousins mom (my aunt) because i told my parents and they talked to her but she thought i made it up and they broke contact for years. That’s why I‘ve always felt so guilty about my family being so divided. And just now, being 20 years old and always feeling that kind of shame at family events (where my aunt and my cousin are present) I realized that it was sexual assault. And that i should not have been feeling guilty for  so many years for something that i did not have any control of. But I still feel shame and i hate it so much.

248,"I have long curly hair. I've struggled for the last 6 months brushing my hair. I would only brush through it maybe once a week, it was difficult but nothing a conditioner couldn't fix. 
I pretty much had no reason to brush it, I don't go out anywhere, I don't see anyone. 

Then 2 months ago my fiance passed away. 
I really didn't care about anything, brushing my hair was not even a thought that crossed my mind. 

It got quite bad and I then kept telling myself I would fix it tomorrow... but never did. 

A few days ago I began to try. It is so so so bad. It is one huge dread lock that it all the way to my roots. I've spent maybe 2-3 hours each day, putting bottles of conditioner on.
