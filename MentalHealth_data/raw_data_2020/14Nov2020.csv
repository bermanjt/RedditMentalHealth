3,"hi folks. first of all, thank you for taking the time to read this- i have been struggling with this issue for only a short while, but it is already incredibly overwhelming. in terms of my past, i have had pretty back anxiety over the past four years, but nothing diagnosed by a health physician. i also have a large fear of losing control and being uncertain about a scenario. 

essentially:

i cannot stop being self-aware of my thoughts and actions, and keep unintentionally putting my focus to the little voice that is inside of my head. there aren’t any particular thoughts that i think about; it’s more-so just the overarching idea that *i* am *thinking* or *doing something*. it occurs when i have a realization that i am unconsciously doing something without thinking about it. i could be sitting down and having a conversation, and i suddenly become incredibly aware of my mind and consciousness. it’s so frustrating and i feel like i’m going crazy.

as a result, i am unable to sit down and relax, and even complete certain tasks. i used to love watching shows on netflix, but i cannot anymore, as my brain keeps realizing that i have immersed myself into the show and therefore immediately refocuses to my mind. if i am listening to music (which is my favorite past-time), the same thing happens. i also want to say that this is similar to what used to happen when i would try to sleep- i would constantly have the idea of sleeping on my mind, and would therefore be up all night. this is different however, as i am awake for 12 hours a day and have to deal with it 24/7.

does anybody have any advice? the best thing that i have found is to fully immerse myself into things that require brainpower (like writing this post) but the minute that i try to relax, i am unable to and the focus comes racing back. i am thinking of trying mediation, but if anyone has any additional advice, please let me know.

thank you all",14Nov2020,1

5,"as the title says, i have been extremely unmotivated to do anything i like, for months. i’m constantly exhausted from doing anything. doing anything besides laying in bed feels like a chore. my “favorite” hobby is drawing, yet i find no joy in that anymore. i only continue it because i have nothing better to do and i have an instagram art account. however insta makes me hungry for engagement, which makes me think my art is not worth anything but a couple likes. i miss being able to draw out of pure joy. i know this sounds very silly and pathetic but ughhh i’m not feeling very good. i’m sitting at my desk, drawing right now and despising every single second. i hate everything i create, yet i still force myself to create content. other than that, i don’t have the motivation to actually practice my skills. i feel like i’m only waking up to be in school and get good grades to satisfy my parents expectations. other than that i’d rather do nothing but lay in bed. thank you if you read this, have a nice day/night :[",14Nov2020,1

7,"I have a relationship with someone diagnosed with mental health issues, schizoaffective in the case. We have been dating for more than 2 years and even tho things have been very harsh in the past, right now my partner has been doing quite well and stable and is completely receptive to treatment and therapy. He has a good job, hobbies, some friends, a girlfriend, basically all the milestones that someone could think on the early 20s, so, it was a really huge progress taking in account he was suicidal 2 years ago. 

Obviously sometimes some depressive episodes still occur, specially with all the covid situation that is stressing all our local village right now. When that happens, he basically shuts down from most things, including me, and makes communication really really hard, specially not living together, if he doesn't reply to me or answer calls or anything, it's very difficult to manage. I try to manage it the best that I can and offer my support in all things that could help the situation but usually it all ends up in just waiting that it fades off, and it does fade off. 

But the last time it happened I was very honest with him, that I needed some kind of communication, that I was also managing a lot of stuff on my own right now and I wasn't even able to have an honest communication from his side. I didn't ask for his support, he was surely in no place to give it to me, I asked for just something to remind me that he's there... He said that it is what it is and that it has always been like that and I should be used to it by now because he was already feeling bad enough and didn't need my complains to add to it. This kind of phrase was not new to me because it was something he had said in the past many times on similar situations, but, right now, it just hit differently. 

You know that feeling when you achieve something on your life or are working to it and you are going to share it with your partner? It hit me when I thought about doing it, but didn't because it was pointless, he wouldn't care. Or even smaller things, this week I gave 3 classes as substitute on a different school from the one I usually teach because the teacher was off because of covid, I broke my car, I planned 2 projects for my master degree, I read one the best books of my life, and I didn't tell most of it to my partner because it was pointless. Maybe any of us is at fault but I don't know if this is sustainable long term... if someone has any advice I'd surely appreciate. I love my partner to bits, but I don't want to be like this, I don't want to feel like all achievements on my life are nothing, I was like that years ago, with a different partner, and I'm not going to be that person again.",14Nov2020,1
8,"Perhaps  from childhood, or something else, but ever since i have been  sitting  24/7 in my room for the past years, not going to school anymore,  i  begin to have an irrational fear of evil people, people who are out  to  get me, i imagine and start to see certain people as some sociopath   narcissistic evil doers, who will do everything they can to ruin me,   perhaps i have done something to them and i imagine that they are   planing to get revenge on me one day. Everyday i get extremely stressed   out as i think and think about people, i psychoanalyze them, and  imagine  what they would do, how they think, i imagine up scenarios  where they  gain power through status, or whatever, and they condemn me  and  humiliate me or something, doing something evil behind the scenes  where  no one else but i can see, superficial and fake, and i get  gaslighted  and everybody agrees with them. And also say i have a  girlfriend, i  imagine up scenarios where they seduce her and steal her  from me, i get  very scared and fearful of that happening, idk what is  going on with my  brain. It's been years since i last interacted with  anyone, im alone by  myself in my room for years.

I  suffer from huge anxiety and stress on a daily basis for no apparent  reason, it's equivalent to life threatening situation kind of stress and  anxiety, but nothing is happening but my own thoughts i come up with  from my brain.",14Nov2020,1
9,"how do you deal with something really really bad you did as a kid? every time i think of it my stomach drops and everything feels wrong and diseased

i used to barely have a conscience. i didnt care when i did something bad because i couldnt feel remorse or guilt but at some point i got one. i hate it.

sometimes i spiral, sometimes i dont care much. but when i spiral i tell myself it will always be a part of me and that the feelings are going to start getting worse and worse as i get older and that ill never escape it. i feel so trapped and sick. it will always be something ive done. 

i cant tell anyone in real life. not a friend, relative, therapist etc.

10,"I want to apologize in advance for how long this is and any errors I made. I'm not okay right now. 

I'm 29f and I've been dating my 35m fiance for about 2 years now. I love him more than anything but he has become so abusive(verbally) toward me. He's had anger problems since we've been together but it just seems to be getting worst. He has been seeing a therapist and is on medicine but he doesn't believe the therapist can help him with talking to him about the reasons why hes so angry and how to find healthy ways to cope. I believe he has bpd or Intermittent explosive disorder. He has struggled with anger all his life and has abandonment issues. He had been treated poorly since he was a child by both parents. And im sure this is what contributed to his anger now. He does feel extremely bad after these angry outburst he has but he does it again. For small things especially things he assumes im thinking and doing that i'm not. Every time I try to express my sadness after he apologizes. Or try to explain myself, he gets angry and tells me I just want to be negative and I have darkness in my heart to bring up something that weve already worked out. But we didnt. He screams at me and attacks me verbally and then apologizes and wants me to forget it happened and move on and be positive. Ive tried to do this over and over but its starting to be too much for my heart. This happens weekly sometimes twice a week. Like today he was angry because I sounded sad cause yesterday he screamed at me because he felt like I didnt want to watch a video he wanted to share and he always watches mine. This has been an issue since forever about him feeling I dont want to do things he likes too. I told him I did want to watch the video and he told me I was a liar. He called me a manipulative bitch so many times and told me to shut up..called me a shit..and told me to stop heing an idiot and he won't treat me like this..and if I kept pissing him off he would pee on me and to fuck off. I kept trying to talk to him but its impossible when hes angry. I cant tell him how im feeling and that hes scaring me and my heart hurts cause it will just make him more angry. Im so so hurt right now cause I know he doesnt mean these things cause hes generally a sweet and helpful person and I love him so much and I dont want be without him and turn my back on him like everyone else. I just don't know what to do about the situation.",14Nov2020,1
11,"i don’t want to commit suicide or anything. i really don’t want to die at all. i also don’t want to live anymore though. i don’t have any plans for suicide or anything and the idea doesn’t even interest me. i just don’t want to do things anymore, i just want to sleep until all of this pain goes away. i’m doing it to myself. 

it all started with my OCD getting out of control. i ruined my boyfriends mental health with my compulsions until he broke up with me. this breakup was 2 weeks ago. after a few days the relationship related compulsions went away. now i am just obsessing over him so much. I just miss him so much constantly. He told me that he might start dating other people sometime soon. He’s also said he might want to get back together in the future. he seems to be confused and he’s not doing well with this breakup at all. I don’t know what to think. The thought of him being with someone else gives me so much indescribable pain. I don’t want to be selfish so i’m not going to try to stop with him. I explained how unhealthy it could be and he said he understands. He has told me that he’s been coping in ways that were really unhealthy. I feel so bad because I can’t really help him. I’m not going to share what it was because that’s his business but he said that he was very close to doing a certain thing. It wasn’t THAT harmful for him but the thing that it was just hurt me so unbelievably much to hear about for specific reasons. It completely felt like I was being cheated on even though i’m single. 

I really can’t control my emotions. I think in extremes and that makes me act out. My entire mindset changes from one extreme to the other every few hours. All I want is to make people happy. I want to help people, but I just hurt them so much. I feel everything so strongly. I used to almost never get angry and it would just be crying but lately i have been so angry all the time. I will just get these huge anger outbursts and just hate everyone. I will even say mean things to my friends. It feels like it’s all for attention while i’m doing it, but I don’t want to do it. I also don’t want to not do it. It’s very complicated. I know that i’m going to lose everyone in my life but that’s what i’m scared of. Being alone terrifies me. I’m in so much pain and no one understands. No one can help me. I’m not fun to be around. I’m either super impulsive and hyper and doing all sorts of productive things and laughing and screaming or  i’m super upset and on the verge of tears and getting angry and acting like it’s all a joke. sometimes it is kind of like a joke until i actually make myself miserable. 

Keep in mind that i’m a teenager so maybe some of these things are more normal, i have no idea but my friends who are also teenagers act nothing like this. I also have a therapist but during my last appointment I was feeling very motivated and okay so she thinks I am okay and I’m not. I was taking medication that was for OCD and is also an anti depressant and a mood stabilizer. I lost it. I’m getting it refilled soon though.",14Nov2020,1

14,"Hi everyone! So a little background. I'm a full time nurse in the US and have been since 2013. I am also a mother to two boys and I'm in college part time to further my degree. I started back in college last August. 

I'm posting because I am so completely overwhelmed, depressed, and anxious. It's... overwhelming. I've always had bouts of depression and I live with anxiety but it used to be pretty manageable. I would have maybe 3 or 4 panic attacks a year. I've never been on any anxiety or depression medication because I feel like I've been able to manage it ok without. 

In March we sent our kids to live with my in-laws until we learned more about COVID because my in-laws already watched the boys when both my husband and I were working and my job is considerably high risk. A week after that I came down with COVID and the kids ended up living with my in-laws for 11 weeks. We talked on Zoom but that was it. That period of my life was the absolute darkest period of my life. I cried multiple times a day and was in the deepest pits of depression that I have ever known. I would cry multiple times a day and I was having panic attacks every week, often in the middle of work, and contemplated suicide for the first time in my life. There was absolutely no joy in life. The phone calls with my kids always ended with me leaving early because I was crying to much and I didn't want them to see. 

Anyway they've been home for a couple months and things have been better but it's still a struggle. I continue to disassociate throughout the day and every couple of weeks I feel like I ""wake up"" from a depressive episode. I'm still having panic attacks every few weeks. For instance, I had a really really bad one today. A manager at Trader Joe's gave me flowers and said thank you for being a nurse and for when I got back to my car I just....broke. His kindness broke me, for some stupid reason. I was sobbing and hyperventilating and my hands went numb and I almost blacked out. It was very rough. 

My question is this- I know that I'm depressed. I know that my anxiety is at an all time high. I know that I should seek help. But I also know that this is all related to COVID. It's related to nursing in a pandemic, the isolation, and the general uncertainty in the world. Therefor, I think that this will end. I believe that it will. I don't want to start medication when COVID is, hopefully, a temporary problem. Many depression/ anxiety medication have a ton of side effects and are hard to stop one they've been started. What would you do? Should I just keep soldiering through or seek medication?  Thanks y'all. Stay safe and healthy out there.",14Nov2020,1
15,"This has probably been a common problem for others during the course of the pandemic and has likely been asked many many times in the sub reddit so i’m sorry for that, but i could do with venting and possibly getting some advice.

So i recently moved back into my family home, from Uni, before a month-long national lockdown in the UK. A few days ago i tested positive for covid (im asymptomatic) , but thankfully my parents are both negative. However, it means that i’m in isolation for the next 8 days (2 already completed), and i’m literally confined to my room to avoid giving it to my parents. 

I have anxiety which has mainly subsided in recent months, but just 2 days in and i feel fucking awful. I constantly feel sick which was always a common theme for my anxiety, i’ve lost a lot of my appetite and i feel extremely unmotivated to do any uni work and it kinda feels like everything is crumbling around me despite me knowing it’s really not. 

Usually a nice dog walk or exercise does the trick but without me being able to leave my room at all, i’m kinda lost as to what i’m supposed to do. Thanks in advance.

Therefore, I haven’t been as productive with my client work. My clients aren’t on me about it, but somehow I still feel as if I’m letting them down or failing because I took almost a whole week off.

17,"I don't really want to go on too long about myself, mainly because I don't really think my circumstances are as bad as most people. But I just need advice. As a little background information, my parents financially provide for me both in terms of school tuition fees and putting a roof over my head, so I don't really have a place to bitch about my life. My dad is your typically emotionally repressed ethnic and religious parent who has gone his whole life bottling up the tremendous trauma he endured as a poor kid living in a war torn country. My mother grew up in even worse circumstances, so you can gauge how the two of them don't have the best experiences growing up with love to understand how to replicate it for their kids. 

Because of their childhood, and the hardships they went through to bring me to a Western country and give me the opportunity to gain a good quality post secondary education, I really have no room to comment how rough things have been for me with them. Nor that I ever could because my family tends to very much ascribe to the ""suck it up and move on"" mentality of life. I live alone with my sister who has her own issues, and is even more repressed than me so that's a no-go. I don't really have too. many friends, as I've lost a majority of them due to my own induced seclusion and general anxiety. I've only got my cat as an outlet lol. I've battled depression and suicidal ideations for years now, and every year it gets even more difficult. I finally mustered the courage to get a diagnosis this summer because it was either that or I die. And there's no way I was going to do that to my mother. I got a general diagnosis for clinical depression, but was transferred to a psychiatrist to be evaluated for bipolar disorder, because I relate a lot to the symptoms of the disorder. Fast forward a couple months, no clear diagnosis yet and my psychiatrist has seemed to abandon me, no follow up calls like he promised, no contact with me whatsoever so I assume now that's just that. I'm now in my last year of University, and it's getting increasingly difficult to maintain my overall good grades. Every day I wake up with emptiness and no will to go on, and while I've tried so very hard to just force myself through school, and do well at it at the same time I feel like I'm breaking again and I don't know what to do.

I'm too afraid to go on meds even if it does seem like it could help me balance and regulate my moods. I'm too afraid of how upset it would make my mother, because as someone who was depressed for the major part of raising me, and my siblings it would just seem ridiculous for me someone who is in much better circumstances than her to take the ""easy route out"". She would just bet to me to find alternate forms of healing, and she's not wrong. She doesn't have to know, but the guilt of it would eat away at me.

Does anyone have any ideas, techniques, etc. of coping that could help me survive this year of school? I've read some self helping articles online, but I have yet to find any resource worth the time as everything is always the same. Go outside, eat better, sleep better, socialize. But I haven't done either of those things for so long, and I'm too afraid I've dug a hole too deep for myself now to get out of. Any help would mean the world to me, and if you've read this far - thank you.",14Nov2020,1

I see depression from two perspectives: there’s the normal where you take a moderate dose of an SSRI and move on with your life, and there’s the extreme where basically you are mentally insufficient. I haven’t wanted to admit that I’m screwed in the head and now a nutcase, but I think today’s incident might be indicating otherwise

I’ve been on 60 mg Prozac and 300 mg Wellbutrin for the last three weeks now

Some of the side effects I was feeling were:

Heightened Anxiety
Hand shaking
Insomnia

But, I also felt a little more motivated, and my orgasms were the best they’ve ever been

The only problem is today I had an incident. I’ve always been kind of a loser- never really that good at anything. I’ve been on a couple different routes that have failed, and yesterday I had a final exam worth 90% of my grade which I only completed half of. I also had 100% extra time to take it. You can imagine how worthless I felt after that exam. Utterly and completely worthless

I ended up just feeling more numb than anything last night. I did break down at one point. I did not sleep well at all last night. I was waking ip every couple of minutes. This morning, I was okay, and then I stepped in the shower. Idk what happened, but it all just came bearing down on me at once, and I lost it

Now, I’ve never really been suicidal in my past. I mean the thought has crossed my mind a few times over the years, but it was never something I’d act on. But, today was bad. My parents aren’t that knowledgeable about depression, so they often tell me I’m being dramatic and that I need to buck up. I texted my Mom (out of state) to tell her I was feeling shitty. My end goal was to tell her I needed her. I never got that part out. Her response was that she was busy at work and that I need to  buck up and study for my other exams

I lost it. She just kept telling me to stop running away from my problems. It just escalated. I went to my iron, cut off the cord, tied it into a noose, and tried it around my neck. Now, look, I can’t kill myself. I am way too scared of the pain. My parents are at that point where they think I’m the boy who cried wolf. I called my psych for an emergency call, and she was about to call the police (I really don’t need the repercussions of mental hospitalization). I lied to her and said I didn’t make the noose (I threw it out). But, once I calmed down, I got on the phone with my other psychiatrist and told him what happened. 

Idk why I think it might be the Wellbutrin, but I think today’s incident may have been that. Tell me if I’m wrong, but is there something with the way it activates dopamine that it would make you likelier to do something impulsive like have suicidal ideation when you’ve broken down?

In either case, my mom is pissed at my psychiatrist (my parents don’t understand that you have to try a cocktail of meds to find the one that works. They say I’ve just been experimenting irrationally)

I talked to the psych and he said to stop the Wellbutrin immediately and to up my dose on the Prozac from 60 mg to 80 mg although he doesn’t entirely think the meds are the reason for today

In either case, idk about messing around with my regimen. I feel like I didn’t give Wellbutrin its full time to kick in. I only gave it three weeks, not six

Also, I don’t want to admit that I’m messed up, but is today’s incident an indicator that I’m a pretty bad case? I mean I’m about to start 80 mg of Prozac. Do I have to come to terms with the fact I am no longer normal, and that I’m now mentally insufficient?",14Nov2020,1
27,"Today I put my hands on my dad. After 27 years of living, having argued, screamed at, swore at and slammed the table, today I put my hands on my dad for the first time. Him and my mom were arguing and I just snapped, I approached him and put my hands on him in a threatening manner. I didn't strike him, or put my hands around his neck, I grabbed his shoulders and said some stuff I sincerely regret. He egged me on, yelling in return and approaching me. My dad and mom have never struck me or been abusive towards me. In fact, they've been nothing but loving parents. The best I could ask for. Having said that, today I disgraced myself by doing what I did. Usually when him and my mom argue, I get angry as well and yell at both of them. Usually dad and I go our separate ways, until he inevitably comes to me an hour later apologizing and both of us end of laughing. That's been the case for every argument, until today. 

I explained to my mom, part of the reason I lash out when they argue is because I don't want them to split up. After some crying and talking to, both mom and dad assured me they aren't going anywhere. They fight, I know it and its going to continue happening. They told me to just walk away if it happens. They both end up laughing about it anyway. I'm disgusted with myself. I would never have though I'd lay hands on my dad and today I did. I explained to both of them, that I'm going to be seeking some professional help for my anger. Clearly I still have some anger issues and other problems from the past that I just haven't let go of yet. We're all fine now, dad and I laughed it off and mom is good.

29,"I’m 17 she’s 19. She isn’t diagnosed with anything, but she is on anti-Psychotic medication. 

She screams, cry’s and wails everyday, she insults me, screams at me, calls me a bitch ect, hits me, throws things. But she’ll also tell me she loves me, that I’m the only person she has, that she’s so grateful for my help, so grateful for everything I do for her. She is paranoid, any conversation can transform into screaming and crying and hyperventilating, running up the garden screaming, rolling around on the floor, banging the walls. I don’t like coming out of my room. 

Most mornings I am woken up by screaming, I struggle to sleep, once asleep, she comes into my room to wake me up. Or just the screaming outside will wake me up. Sometimes I sleep through, some nights I only get a few hours sleep. 

This is been everyday for over 2 months. 

I suffer with anxiety and at points depression. When stressed I get tense, I get a lot of pain in my arms and legs from tension. Last few nights I’ve fallen asleep around 6-8am.

I feel awful for her, I do everything I can for her, it hurts to see her in so much pain. How do I help her? She is seeing doctors and has a metal health support team. Her constant attacks and words cut me so deeply, I love her. She knows everything about me and knows how to hurt me. She is so delusional and paranoid, she can’t be held responsible for her actions or word. Any stress results in screaming, crying, and panic attacks. She screamed so much today her nose started bleeding. 

I don’t know what to do. I need help but I don’t know where to go. Covid has complicated everything. I can’t cope. I can’t live here. I was trying to move out but finding work at 17 during Covid is near impossible. I can’t get away due to lockdown. I can’t sleep. I want to scream.",14Nov2020,1

31,"I'll try to put this as quickly as I can. I tend to get overly attached to people online because I have no friends IRL. I was diagnosed with asperger syndrome and suicidal depression a long time ago so I tend to hyperfocus on what brings me joy. 

Something I do is crave attention, constant reassurance, and love. I tend to put my all into showering someone or something with love, hoping to make them happy and reaffirm our friendship. Recently I deeply hurt my friends' feelings. It's a long story but they never wanted anything to do with me again and blocked me after I made things worse and worse, and then left a server I loved very much because I felt hurt and disrespected over something that a mod said. This was around the third or fourth time this had happened in my life.

They unblocked me to pelter me with very harsh words such as ""blocking you was the healthiest thing I could have done"" or ""you're actions are like something out of a yandere anime"". They also called me a bad and selfish person, how I don't like when things don't go my way or follow my schedule.

I have cried more recently than I had ever done in my entire life. I hurt my friends so much and I don't want to let go. I want to try and make it up to them, win them back, and change for the better so things can be okay again.

I lied about getting a therapist because they asked me to get help, but there are none in my area. Now I'm stuck trying to find ways to get better by myself. I cannot let this happen again. It haunts me and cost me a lot of happiness. My brain only tells me yo end myself though, but I know I'm too scared to die so I won't do it.

It has been working well for me, but I recently got a letter from my insurance company saying they are no longer covering it as of Jan 1. As an alternative, they will cover paxil, prozac and zoloft. I can't afford viibryd without insurance so I have to move to one of these drugs.

35,"Ok, for some background I have been officially diagnosed as having moderate ADHD. Anyway, on to the show. For this fist part, I think this stuff is mostly adhd driven but anyway, I have a tendency to like to blast very loud and chaotic music such as House and I like to drive as fast as the law will allow me and I just like the sound of the car accelerating and I’m very fidgety in general. Now onto the non adhd stuff. Firstly, I have a tendency to hate certain sounds if I’m in a bad mood like chewing or laughing or a fork hitting a plate or even just someone’s voice. Secondly, I have this overwhelming tendency to compare myself to people regardless of age or how long they have been doing stuff vs my time and it has gotten to the point that I almost can’t not be the best at something and it really gets on my nerves when others are better even though I know logically I can’t be the best and it even gets to the point that I develop masochistic crushes on women who are quite un quite better than me. It is almost an obsession and particularly with learning foreign languages since even though I have an aptitude with them and am well in my way to being able to speak French fluently though I am now upper immediate, I still end up comparing myself to people twice my age for no logical reason and I ended up developing a masochistic crush on this female redditor who says that English is her third language which despite her saying she was married for 10 years in the post and thus probably being much older than me, I still ended up with a masochistic and sexual crush on her. I also have a tendency to find whole countries of people to be superior in some way to me and not the rest of society. It’s weird I know but I seem to have a sort of obsessive inferiority complex with over romantic tendencies(though I am already a hopeless romantic in general and the thought of love just makes me happy). Sorry that this is long",14Nov2020,1
36,"So I have had a problem with my mental health since I was young. I was about 5 or 6 when I first realized that something about me wasn't quite right. 

I tried so hard to tell my parents that something was wrong. That I needed help. That I was having bad thoughts. I can recall my dad hugging me and offering to get me therapy but it never happened. 

I didn't get any therapy until I was 18 after my mother read my makeshift journal and saw my writing about hallucinations. When my dad and I were talking about this, I was explaining to him one night and he was taken aback by what I told him. To which he said he should have gotten me help back when I was younger. I reminded him how he had promised me but never followed through. He told me how he wanted to send me to therapy many times but my mother kept brushing it off by saying ""she's just being dramatic"" or ""she's just being a teenager"" and this made me mad because she had always done that to me.

She took my brother to get help when he was struggling with focusing on elementary school and he was diagnosed with ADHD. But when I struggled with the same issue she told me to pay attention (I however don't have ADHD, I have Major Depressive Disorder but it mimicked the symptoms of ADHD). Again she didn't realize I needed help until she read my journal and realized how much my mind had started to deteriorate.

This isn't even the half of it it's just frustrating and something that still bothers me that I'm having to work through in therapy (along with being abused by two different people in my life in two very different ways)",14Nov2020,1

As you can see this post is about turning off your emotions or as I like to call it flipping the switch something I believe I’ve done while hard to tell I don’t feel emotions for minor things now but I wonder if they would force themselves back on if something major happened and how it would work I’m also curious if flipping my emotions off has anything to do with me diving into the astral realm and talking to my higher self I’m looking for answers I don’t know what answers but answers so if you can help or have advice please do indulge me with your wisdom",14Nov2020,1
38,"Today I pushed away the man who has become my reason to be strong, to keep trying and to live. I met his mother a few weeks ago and though she liked me I was very wary as I have been down this road before. I am madly in love with this man and wanted to try for his sake to have a meaningful relationship with his mother.

I write poetry and creative writing about how I am feeling. I have never seen it as a problem but she did. I sent her a piece I was very proud of and she responded by telling me the theme (third person view of suicide) was very inappropriate and it was a way to manipulate and mentally abuse the people around me. I was crushed.

I fought with my bf last night over it and he wanted me to look at it from a different perspective. I \*can't\*. Not this time, not on this. I feel horrible and like I was played for the fool again. I swore I wouldn't get close with a bf's parents ever again after the times before. Still though I allowed myself to open up and even stayed at her home the other night without my bf because I was feeling ill.

Today I had a huge fight with him. I didn't take my medications until much later and honestly they haven't helped in the slightest. I fought with my godmother over the issue and she threatened to hurt herself or drive over even though she had been drinking. She tells me I am her reason to keep living but I just can't....

I lied to her today for the first time. It was a small semi lie that I was fine and going to resolve things with my bf. It was still a consciously made lie. After that I had a therapy appointment over zoom and excused myself to go ask the maintenance man (who molested me and I'm legally not supposed to talk to) to stop yelling because I could hear him from two apartments away. The lady who is a former teacher of mine told me to back off and step away. I was incredibly offended. I only told this guy to stop being so loud and here she is telling me off (mind you everyone in the complex knows what went down by now but ""he's so nice"" that they either don't believe me/turn a blind eye.). I flipped her off and walked away slamming my door behind me. I can hear them when they talk about me and I heard the maintenance guy say that he would call tomorrow about me. I proactively called to explain the situation but the receptionist didn't care in the slightest. I have a history of complaints about me and I'm terrified I'll finally be evicted. 

I hung up on my therapist after she said something about I was choosing to let things upset me. She didn't even ask what was going on. 

After that I laid down by the door in the fetal position to listen to them talk about me and I grabbed a knife. I didn't cut myself till later- I felt too emotionally tired to even try. 

After I laid on my couch and couldn't be bothered to turn up the thermostat even though I was freezing. I slipped in and out of sleep and broke up with my bf sometime in that period. He called numerous times and usually I physically cant turn down a call from a loved one (the ingrained ""don't ignore me"" from my youth) but I couldn't find it in me to care. He was sad but i didn't feel much of anything- I still don't. 

I cut later after that and usually I would tell someone straight away but honestly, what does it matter? Everything is falling apart, a few swipes of a steak knife is really not my biggest concern. 

I went out to the mall and everything went wrong to put it in shirt. I tried calling my now sort of bf and he was sleeping before he answered so I hung up and didn't bother to text him until 3 hours later.

My mom wanted to buy me food once I got back but I walked back up the hill in the dark which is something I'm usually terrified of. 

I've been eating less, sleeping more and not caring for my body. Apparently normal people don't throw away food and dig through the trash later to eat it because they can't be bothered to make more food. Apparently it's not healthy to not shower or change your panties. 

Today was the final straw I think. I feel empty and hurt but if I lose him this is it. I don't want to care, I don't want to see anyone, I don't care if I live or die at this point. Everything feels horrible and I can't figure out how to make it go away. This might be my final post because I don't want to talk anymore. I'm going to let my phone die and that's that. 

Elif, Ken, if you are reading this I'm sorry. I tried to be strong but in the end I am a failure. I tried so hard but I just can't try anymore. This isn't a suicide note, this is a giving up and accepting whatever fate has in store for me note.

39,"Sorry about the title, I'm rubbish at post titles. I wrote several poems about mental health, and this is the only outlet I have to get them out into the world and see if they help anyone. There are a couple more as well, but I thought I'd start with just one or two. The poems are down here: 

&amp;#x200B;

1: Idk What This Even Is  

Have you ever been one of those people, 

The ones who sat in their bed in a dark room, 

Or alone on a damp park bench, or wherever, 

And tried to remember what being happy felt like? 

The ones who thought, that they could die, or disappear, and nobody would notice? 

Nobody would give a damn? 

I give a damn. 

I don’t care why you’re here. 

Maybe you were just curious, 

maybe you weren’t, 

maybe you were looking for something to distract you from your pain so you could make it through another day. 

All I care about right now, in this writing, is letting you know that you would be missed. 

Because it drives me crazy, knowing with certainty every day that there are people hurting themselves, killing themselves, wanting to give up on everything. 

I wish I could do something. 

I wish I could teleport to everyone who felt hurt, or scared, or broken, and say, 

What can I do to make your life feel worth living again? 

I wish I could silence the demons in your head. 

I wish I could hold you, or just sit with you, or anything, to help you find some peace tonight. 

Maybe I can’t do those things for everyone. 

But if you need a listening ear, 

or a story to take your mind off it all, 

I’ll do my best. 

Love, 

A Friend 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

2: Battle Colors 

I fought a war with my mind, I’m still fighting it.

But I’ve won so many battles already,  

And you don’t have to be done fighting to celebrate your victories, 

So I put on my armor: My favorite beautiful clothes. 

So I put on my war paint: Crazy cosplay makeup. 

So I put on my eldritch amulet: My sparkliest jewelry. 

I cover the blank canvas of myself in my brightest battle colors, 

And I celebrate that there is more to me than just survival. 

I celebrate myself. 

I celebrate my victories. 

I celebrate who I am outside of my pain. 

Because armor is not just to protect your body. 

Battle colors aren’t reserved only for physical battles. 

And you don’t have to be done fighting to be happy.",14Nov2020,1
40,"So I know I have posted previously about everything that was going on in late September through mid-late October. And I think it broke something in me.

I have had more pressure added to me, and I don't know how to explain what I'm feeling about it other than something in me snapped.

I came home from helping my mom, and nobody really acted like they cared (I know logically that they do, but it hurt to have been gone so long and not even have gotten a 'welcome home') My sister lost her job that next week, so I have to cover her part of bills now. And I promised my mom that I'd send her a bit of money every month to help her out with all of her expenses.

Well, now I have all that on my plate, but I don't get paid until the end of the month, after taking six weeks of unpaid leave. And since it wouldn't be fair to ask our roommate to pay for EVERYTHING until I got to payday, I tried donating plasma. I got enough to cover my overdraft fees and put a payment on my maxed-out credit card, but my vein rolled off the needle so they have me on a deferral until January.

Needless to say, that's a lot going on. Even in my new position at work, I felt the pressure buildup, but when I came home from the plasma center and my sister was (playfully) chewing me out for not specifying that I was going to the center across town, something in me just broke. Like it sank in to my soul that this is all I will ever know: struggle, picking up the slack, and trying desperately to help my loved ones swim instead of sink.

I still feel the immense pressure of trying to provide for myself, my mom, and my sister. But it's like everything is muted now. Like everything feels less intense, like the color in a painting of life has been washed out. I don't really feel anything strongly anymore- I just exist.

I don't think anyone here can help me with this. But I kinda wanted to get it out into the void. At least until I can afford to get therapy again, it's been about two months since I had an appointment. And I don't honestly even know if I believe that will help me right now.

Logically, I know things will be okay. I broke down and (much as I hated it and felt like an absolute failure) asked on social media for help paying a couple of bills until payday. But emotionally? I don't know what this is, and I don't know how to feel about it.

I highly doubt anyone is going to read this. But if you do... well, just don't ever underestimate how much the people who love you will do for you. Don't forget to give back some of the love in ways that make them happy, too.",14Nov2020,1

42,"So if anyone remembers [this great song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUQsqBqxoR4), I used to think it was just kind of a cliche empowerment song. Of course this isn't going to work for everyone, but I revisited the song and it sounded way more real and genuine than I realized. 

Many of us are unhappy with our situation, because we *are in* shitty situations. But she is simply proposing ""I wonder what would happen if you say what you want to say,"" ""Maybe there's a way out of the cage where you live.""

It was really easy for me (for most of my life) to grow bitter and blame the situation. And I mean, the situation is there. As I said, we are in shitty situations. But we can chose to ""bow down to the mighty"" or we can stop running and holding our tongues. 

Try and give this song a listen -- it has good advice and to me it goes beyond some empowerment song for certain individuals. I don't really see it like that at all, nor do I see it as some bland ""be yourself"" song. I feel like she's acknowledging real hurts and offering real solutions. :) If anyone feels sad and needs a good song, I recommend this one.",14Nov2020,1

To start out, i’m 15 years old, and very unemotional. When I was very young I used to be kind and companionate and actually think about others. I began to notice a change when I was probably 10. I just started to feel like I was slowly becoming an empty zombie. 
5 Years later and here I am. I pretty much fake every emotion and I feel so completely lost. I cannot cry and I honestly can’t love. The word “love” has lost all meaning to me. I’ve never talked to anyone about this and I hate therapists. Im not really suicidal i’d say, but I find death very interesting, almost peaceful in a way.

45,"Was at my lowest point two days back, thought of quitting therapy too. Friends made it worse, no one cared, grabbed something and cut myself for the second time and told them ""atleast now you cannot tell me to live for my parents because I am alive"" when I showed my cut. Dragged myself to therapy, almost yelled at my psychologist about how I felt and how everyone drove me crazy. Mid way, I stopped texting my friends..I just cut them off, they apologized for being rude, but I straight up didn't respond because I clearly understood they do not care anymore. Sending stupid quotes on Instagram which tell I'm the problem because I cannot pick myself up when I'm crying my eyes out ain't helpful. Felt a bit better after the session, friends kept preying in and asking how it went and whether I'm going to quit, just switched off my phone. My sister took me out, spoke to me, honestly still feel she's the only person who connects with me and understands me..she didn't leave me until late at night, and by then I felt better. Next morning, I woke up with no suicidal thoughts for the first time in months, didn't cry the whole day, didn't feel low either..got a wave of sadness, but it passed in about 3-4 minutes.

She told me that it's taking her everything, her will to do things she used to do. 

The mere thought of doing something, she thinks that she can't do it.

There are so many things that's going through her head.

She wants to escape.

Her friends are reaching out, but she turned them down cause she's busy and they won't let her go out that much.

She said that she can't find things enjoyable anymore.

There's nothing that makes her happy anymore.

Everything that usee to bring her joy, gone.

She seems fine but inside she's so lost.

The mere fact that she woke up, and she overthinks immediately.

She's afraid to tryna be happy, but it feels wrong for her that's why she decides not to do it anymore.

She wants happiness to flow in her naturally without looking for it.

She feels wrong to go back, she despises going back to the things she usee to like.

She lost interest to anyone and anything.

She can't take the first step to healing. Cause she always falls down.

She's stuck on her own imaginary land where she's happy, and said that she lost her happiness since she was 13.

She tried to find it but can't.

Her insecurities buried her old self.

She knows what to do, but she can't. It's hard for her.

She feel like she's being taken over by everything.

She's having a hard time forgetting things that happened to her.

I have reasons why this happens.

*Family problems (Pressure, toxicity, lack of communication, lack of support, financial problems)

* Our past specifically how we started (I used to have somebody attached to me when i met her, the girl and i have nothing between us. But she likes me so much shes sending nudes etc. And i want to escape when i met her, and eventually we started talking to each other. She hates me and herself before because she just let that happen, and shes having a hard time forgetting bout it) 

*Studies (Too many requirements, too many works, expensive materials)

*Herself (insecurities, self doubt, dwelling on the past, hard to move on, over thinking)

She's also clinically diagnosed with anxiety and was taking meds and Therapy but she stopped since it costs so much and she feels unsafe and it seems like it wasn't helping her at all.

I really wanna help her, i feel bad that she gas to go through all of this. I know she's the only one that can resolve these issues but i wanna know if there's anyway i can help her to atleast lessen her burden.

49,"So a few months ago i went through a depressive episode. It was really awful and i distanced myself from friends. I was just so terribly depressed and tired that i didn't even have the strength to talk to them or even play videogames with them. Finally thanks to some therapy i started feeling better and talking to my friends again. At first i felt it was great but as time passed i started feeling like an outsider, for a lack of a better term. They talk about videogames i'im not into, or have inside jokes i can't understand. Sometimes simply their attitude makes me feel like i'm not really like them. And it sucks even more cause because of covid i don't get to see them so often, only when we hangout or the few times a week i go to school. So basically i end up doing things on my own when i am at my house. I've tried to hang out with them on discord but i really don't have such a great time. There's a friend i used to be really close to who lives near my house(wich is cool because most of my friends live pretty far away). Anyways i've tried telling him quite a few times that i'd like to hang out with him sometime, but he really seems like he doesn't want to, he just straight up tells me he prefers to stay home playing videogames rather than hanging out with me. This really makes me feel bad, and it has made me think that he simply doesn't care about me, wich led me to think that none of my friends really care about me. I mean they're not mean to me or anything but i feel like they wouldn't really if i just move to another country for example. I've thought of telling my parents to take me to therapy again, but given my background it's really hard for me to approach this. I'm sorry if sometimes my writing isn't really good sometimes, as i said earlier it's difficult for me to talk about this so if you don't understand something i said please tell me.

1. Do you have any experience with depersonalization?
2. Has it effected your daily routine?
3. (relating to my personal experiences) Does it ever feel like you physically cannot get yourself move?
4. story followed by a question- I will feel that way ^ (question 3) and it gets to a point where i can feel this negative energy building up inside of myself, almost like frustration or anger, and i just get to a boiling point to where i hit myself. in the head. it started with other things &amp; occasionally it still is, but i will hit my head hard and sometimes a bunch. it’s like i finally release that energy and i feel like i’ve worn myself out enough to stop being so trapped in my head (if that makes sense). I have been doing a lot better lately (went through a phase a little over a month ago where i was doing it almost daily). 

so I guess my main question is, does depersonalization ever lead to self harm for you? 
are these even related?

61,"It was some years back but it came into my head again. it was a 17 year old boy who died. he was found dead in his car during some dead hour of the morning on a cold winter night. apparently his body was half frozen solid, he had bruises on his neck (he was throttled to death) and blood had dripped out his mouth. his neck was broken. the only people he was with that night were three friends. They killed him for no apparent reason and a witness who saw them hanging out before he got killed said nothing seemed out of the ordinary. for some reason when i think of this one i always cry. why? is it normal?

i know he probably only suffered for a few minutes but those few minutes keep going through my head in vivid detail whenever i remember it. mainly from the perspective of the kid, like him feeling betrayal, wondering why his friends were suddenly killing him. feeling his lungs burn from a lack of air, thrashing about in a dark car going insane, drowning in blood because the neck got broken, heart rate pounding because you can't breathe and you're also being slowly crushed to death as well. And during this no help comes.

He died some 7 years ago, I feel so bad for the kid. I don't believe in ghosts or spirits but I wonder if in the future his parents could get him cloned or something from whatever remained (I read DNA can last up to 10,000 years or something like that) because I feel like I'm grieving over his death (and also grieving for his family) even though I never actually knew him.",14Nov2020,1

Recently, some of my friends have been experiencing an increase in mental breakdowns. Some of them have serious issues, and whatever I say seems to never help. This increase in problems reminded me of my conversations with some old online friends.

When I'd look back on them, I realized how stupid and oblivious I was. One of them was being sexually abused and had tried to kill themselves. I tried coming up for solutions to their problems, but they were absurd and ultimately didn't help. The other was severely depressed and I checked up on them as often as I could to encourage them and try to cheer them up. I had completely missed the implications when they said goodbye to me. I also didn't understand the concept of sexual abuse and rape, and thus my advice was generic and didn't help. 

It just all seems to never stop piling. If I had a painless way to kill myself, I'd definitely consider it. I'd just rather not exist. Whenever I think of the future, I dread how tedious the classes I plan on taking will be, and how much I'll have to work myself in college. All of these crippling expectations are starting to get to me. There's genuinely nothing I want to do ""when I grow up"", despite the front I put out.

Modernly I think we're getting it wrong, I think disorders are incredibly over diagnosed. No, I don't think this a part of some big pharma scheme to push drugs but rather a change in times. If you go back 100 years or even 50 years people were concerned with surviving, they didn't have the luxuries of life that we have now and so there wasn't a lot of time or need to be concerned about mental wellbeing. Well things have changed and people are doing much more than surviving, they are thriving and some how we're still miserable and I'd argue more miserable than ever before. Well why? Our days are no longer filled with hard labour and draconian stresses so we have a lot more time to be present in our own minds, we're in a period of actualization. People want answers to there struggles and as a result medical definitions have been greatly expanded. For example before 2013 you could not be diagnosed with autism and ADHD. We've labeled every quirk of the mind a person could possibly have and every one of them push individuals closer to being diagnosed with something, there is a spectrum for everything now. 

The majority of us are not broken, oddly wired, or living with disorder we're living in a period of time where everything is new, everything grows and advances so fast, politics are changing, technology makes whole leaps in just months, we've got nothing but time to be in our own heads and nobody alive now has ever experienced this before. The formulas for success previous generations used are now irrelevant and nobody knows the fuck they are doing. Maybe just maybe while some are really living with a disorder the rest of us are just actualizing what a person can really be and we don't fully understand it so we assume illness.",14Nov2020,1
79,"This is just a rant and personal experience about my worst insomnia episode

1 night without sleep: I personally feel extreme restlessness and a lot of energy on the first day, my train of thought is slow and I lose focus easily, concentrating is hard but still not too hard.

2 nights: Still restless, I tend to experience extremely subtle hallucinations by this point, minor things like walls breathing and muffled audio occasionally, concentration becomes hard and I can't think straight for longer than 10 seconds, I feel sick to my stomach and like vomiting.

3 nights: Restlessness is fading but still present and noticeable, hallucinations begin to progress to mild voices and whispers as well as impact noises. Concentration is almost impossible and communication begins to get hit hard. When standing still on a road and looking down it, it feels as though I'm moving forward or backwards. Train of thought is becoming extremely hard and most of your thoughts are about needing sleep and ""I can't sleep"".

4 nights: restlessness is gone, and exhaustion is strong. Hallucinations can include full conversation with non existent people and hearing voices loudly. Crying and laughing for no reason comes along now. No concentration what so ever. Sickness to the point of close to vomiting is something I feel, thoughts are nothing and depression is sinking in.

5 nights: I felt half dead, and wishing for sleep or even death. Hallucinations include seeing people in the room and talking to them, blacking out. Memory loss is extreme, sickness is gone due to general body numbness. You have no energy to eat or drink and wouldn't be able to keep anything down anyway. Depression is massive and unbearable. Heart rate irregular and breathing is quick and infrequent. You just don't want to experience the torture anymore. 

It was at that point where I slept for 17 hours and woke up with only these memories. I threw up, and felt exhausted. Most symptoms gone, similar feeling to day 2.

That was my worst episode of insomnia. Insomnia Is torture, don't take sleep for granted, its the most important habit in life. It keeps you happy, active and prolongs your lifespan. Without sleep your mental state crumbles and your body goes with it.

80,"I don't know what it is. It could be a combination of social anxiety, paranoid thoughts, and a lack of social interaction during quarantine. But now my fear of being close with someone has increased exponentially. I haven't talked to my friends in 9 months so I'm not sure if I can even call them my friends. 

I've cut myself off from many people (aka ignoring them) because of my paranoid thoughts of them dying. I distance myself from everyone as much as possible so that when they kill themselves, it won't affect me as much. 

It's always a cycle with me. This has caused me to fear my future self, even giving them a name so I can properly blame all this on someone. I would think things like, ""yeah, I don't want to be anyone's friend. But who knows? Future me might mess all that up."" It's almost like I'm talking about a second version of me. I can't trust future me; they always fall into the traps of friendships and end up getting hurt. It's a cycle that I can't break. I say I will stay away, but I always come back.

I don't want to be hurt. I don't want to be used. I never want to get close to anyone in my entire life because when I do, I abandon all rationality in a desperate search of external validation and attention. I know it sounds bad, but I wish that quarantine (isolation) would last my entire life so I would never have to see anyone again. At least that way, I will make sure I won't befriend anyone and I will be safe, alone in my room. Nobody can hurt me and nobody can judge me.

I don't need friends. Friends don't get me good grades or grant money or success. Friends will only use me. (As bad as it sounds,) I have fictional characters to comfort me. They provide enough support that renders real friendships futile. They can't hurt me. People are cruel.",14Nov2020,1

I woke up very tired and got through the whole day with a pain in my left arm, a headache and a pain in my left ear..

Last night is when the very confusing part happened.

At around 6 Pm I went to my old buddy's place for a visit bcz I didn't see him for a long, and we drank a few beers, I got a bit tipsy since my tolerance is low to zero, but still wasn't a big deal.

I came home at around 8 Pm, ate and spent my time with texting and went to sleep, feeling pretty normal.

At 9 Pm when trying to fall asleep is something that never happened to me before. Right before I actually fall asleep I suddenly felt like I'm not in my room anymore, so I open my eyes and I'm in a completely different place with weird creatures surrounding me, I knew I was completely awake and I told my self that's not possible and after 3-4 sec everything dissapeared and I was in my room again.

This happened around 1-2 times more that night, then I fell asleep normally.

Today morning woke up very tired, even tho its saturday and got a bit more sleep than usually because of no work but still..

91,"TW: Suicide, depression

My best friend committed suicide yesterday and I have no idea whether I'm reacting right.

She suffered from chronic depression and anxiety and tried to commit suicide last year already, but failed. I only found out about it in this year, maybe three months ago?

In the past week, another girl in her school, let's call her J, committed suicide, and while J and my best friend weren't good friends, she told me that she was incredibly triggered by it, and she didn't sleep that night and threw up a few times throughout the night.

I did everything I could to support her, I checked in on her as much as I could in the two days after J's suicide.  (J commited suicide Wednesday night, my friend commited suicide Friday afternoon, less than 48 hours apart.) My last message to her was on Thursday night, asking her if I could help her or do something for her before I went to sleep. She replied at three in the morning on Friday, saying that she's okay. I think her mind was already made up then.

I have no idea of how I should react. I wouldn't say that I feel nothing for her death, but it's not affecting me as much as I thought it would. When I first found out, I naturally cried a lot, maybe as a shock reaction, but I don't think I'm really processing the fact that she's dead. Maybe I would've reacted differently if she was in an accident, but I would lie if I said I was surprised that she killed herself.

I guess for her sake, I'm glad she's gone because she truly wasn't happy, but on the other hand I'm also angry that her last message to me was that she was okay and she already knew that she was going to kill herself. I would've gone to the ends of the earth if it meant she'd be happy.

I don't know how I'm feeling, if I'm being honest. I'm not sad. I'm not grieving. There's no tears anymore. My heart feels a bit heavy and my mind is constantly on the situation.

I have my own struggles with anxiety and I know that untreated anxiety can lead to high levels of apathy, so maybe that's the answer, maybe it's not. I just don't know. It sucks. How can I feel next to nothing for my best friend's death?",14Nov2020,1
92,"I tend to get intrusive thoughts that stay in my head and refuse to leave, often times consuming me for days and in this case about a week so far. I random started thinking about death and what happens after and it terrified me, I started panicking and ive felt off for the past week.. like in a fog and out of it, its given me a constant migraine as well, I haven’t talked to anyone and I’ve been isolating in my room because its made me so depressed and anxious. Ive always been ok with the thought, and I’ve always believed in a higher power and that even if there is nothing after death its whatever, but for some reason this has all been stripped away from me. I don’t want to go without my family, my friends, my girlfriend, without music and the things I love. Its scaring me and eating away at me, everything seems pointless and meaningless. I feel like im going to be stuck feeling and thinking this way for the rest of my life. No matter what I do I cant stop thinking and worrying about it. I spend most of my day looking up things on the internet and reading NDE (near death experiences) and trying to pray to feel better, so far its the only thing working but its short lived.

93,"Needless to say how tough this year's been, the mental weariness took its toll and I think I'm starting to finally show cracks. Management threatened to fire me at least 4 times this year, it's obvious that many corporations became somewhat ""stricter"" knowing people don't have as many options as before because of the pandemic.  I started becoming  very paranoid, my heart palpitates whenever my shift is about to start and I always suspect the management is ""out to get me"". I don't really have the budget at the moment to commit to long-term talk therapy, so I just decided to see a psychiatrist and look into the option of medication. What do you think?",14Nov2020,1
94,"I've been trying to figure out a bit of an issue for awhile now, and can't seem to sort it. I don't know how to explain it well other than some days I wake up feeling very male and others I feel very feminine and wanting to shave off most of my body hair and stuff. This has affected me for a good deal of time and even swayed things like purchasing descisions, people I associate with (when I feel more feminine I have a very difficult time even talking to other guys deemed too 'male' because it freaks me out), how I dress, etc. Originally I didn't know if this was some sort of lgbtq+ type ordeal but I don't know if prior trauma would be able to enduce this.  


As far as I can sort out my panic around 'too male' males when I feel female is probably due to my father taking a lot of his ptsd out on me. It makes sense to me at least. And I think the shifting also probably has to due with that coupled with my very shy persona and self reimagining after failing my most recent suicide attempt a couple years ago or so.  


So then to boil it down would I be some shade of gender-fluid or is it jsut a prolonged effet of lots of trauma? Or I guess as a second question would trauma cause someone to be more gender fluid? But then I guess that opens a can of worms about gender fluitity being an illness/treatable etc. I dunno, I'm just kinda confused.

I know what the cause is and that is a failed relationship with a former dear friend of mine(this part is more suited for /r/relationshipadvice) and ever since it ended I can't stop thinking about it in either way.

Usually what will happen is I will hear a word, phrase, see something, imagine something in my mind that has become closely identified with this person and will start the ruminating from there.

Some days I can go hours before I get a memory trigger, others I wake up immediately with them on my mind. At this point I can't help but think about all the ways I possibly ruined our friendship even to the point of thinking about stuff that had nothing to do with it. Like I can't help but try to punish myself for things that I know weren't the cause/had no control over.

I'm able to get through the days I work due to being busy, but on my days off, I sometimes spend most of the day thinking back onto things, thinking about ways I could have prevented or avoided our friendship ending.

100,"I need to preface this by saying that I tried to kill myself earlier this year. I lived with an abusive roommate for three years, and it eventually drove me to the hospital.


I'm frustrated to say the least.

I ended up in the hospital for suicide, i had to move hundreds of miles away from my college that I dropped out of to live with my parents and get away from the situation that I was facing. I was dead in my mind for MONTHS. I couldn't feel anything. It was wake up, eat, sleep, over and over again. My mother would worry about me, constantly mother henning me and trying to comfort me. I thought she at least had my back.

Boy, was I fucking wrong. Got some of my life back, started therapy, got diagnosed with bipolar disorder and anxiety, and got a job. Then she started with how I wasn't really mentally ill. It was just all in my mind. Yeah, no fucking shit Sherlock. She tells me to just ignore it. No need to take medicine(which I still don't) or try to understand it. Keep it bottled inside she says. Thats what she does when she feels bad she says.

I move out. I start feeling better as I work on improving myself. Got a boyfriend, rekindled some old friendships, joined a casual esports team. Strange how being away from the constant negativity and ignorance really helped me. Anyways, I learned just the other day that my mother was told by a teacher and also suspected that I was ADHD as a kid, but because I made good grades, she never bothered to get me tested.

I'm seeing red at this point. One, you fucking deny how I feel because its not how ""you feel"" so it doesn't exist? Two, you didn't get me tested for something that could seriously fuck up my day to day life(I asked my psychologist about it and now he wants to get me tested after the discussion). So, now I have to go clean up this goddamn mess because you couldn't be bothered? Like, fucking seriously? You paid so much attention to my older sister(long story) and doted on my younger sister, but you never even stopped to consider how broken everything that happened left me?

Was the dead look in my eyes for months not good enough for you?

Was seeing me in a hospital gown, crying because I had been trapped in a small hallway for four days with nothing to keep me distracted not good enough for you?

Was the screaming panic attacks not good enough?

Was the begging for death not good enough?

Was writing about the numbness not a fucking clue?

Do you even care that I want to cry every night from not feeling supported?

Do you even care that I get frustrated when you tell me to ignore the disease that almost killed me?

Did the puking every day not clue you in?

What about forgetting everything?

I cant even remember what you look like a year ago.

The episodes?

You didn't want me to go to the doctor when I was bleeding from my intestines. Do you know how that feels? Why? Why did you suddenly turn from the mother who cared for me so diligently for those months into someone who doesn't even care?

I dont deserve this.

I didnt ruin your life.

I didn't force you to raise my nieces. 

I didn't beat you, or berate you, or steal from you.

I was the good kid, the one that through all the bullshit with my older sister, was beside you. I gave every thing I could to make myself someone you could be proud of.

I cracked under the pressure. I failed, but at least I'm still alive. At least I'm still here. At least I still love you. 

I'm empty without you here. I wish i could have my old mom back. Im sorry that you're the shell of a person I once knew. I want to go back to when I was sure you were a good mother. Flawed, and made mistakes, but so pure and loving and good.

101,"My girlfriend (who I'll call D)'s friend (L) recently lost a pet, and D realized that she thinks she feels numb to death. This may seem like a very small reason to think that could be the case, but there's s bit more to it. We both thought it was because she's just used to death and doesn't feel like it's that much of a sensitive subject, but she knows that she still felt emotional when one of her own pets and her grandfather died. She was attached to L's pet, too, so she was confused as to why she couldn't feel emotional when it passed. D knows that she's felt numb like that before with someone even closer than a pet. 

She tried to put herself in L's shoes and imagined that the pet was hers, but she just ended up crying without really feeling anything. 

I offered to do some research for her, since she knew that if she tried, she'd just end up thinking she was crazy.

105,"I have made a decision. A decision that I should have made some time ago. But I 
guess as they say “better late than never”. I have decided to put an end to the pity 
party that I host for myself once in every 2-3 weeks. I instead am going to be 
“furiously happy”. So happy that I am going to start calling it euphoria. I am going 
to be euphoric. All the freaking time. Yeah!
Let’s rewind a little and let me give you a little backstory. As far as I can 
remember I have been an extremely quiet, awkward, anxious, moody person all my 
life. I think I genetically endowed these traits since I come from family of people 
who could easily meet the DSM criteria of various disorders on the psychotic as 
well as neurotic spectrum. Holy Shit. So, basically I am destined to be crazy. 
Lucky me. Not. 
As you can imagine, its not easy to live with anxiety. You’re basically worried and 
constantly thinking about EVERY god damn thing. Right from your job, family 
members, friends, pets, your neighbor’s pets, the weather, the economic and 
political scene in America, world peace, global warming, life on other planets, 
questions of after life, and so on. You get my drift. It’s like your brain is a sports 
car driving on a freeway with no breaks. It’s exhausting if not hazardous to say the 
least.
My mood swings don’t quite help the situation either. I can go from being in a rage 
of anger to being completely zen in less than 5 minutes. From being absolutely 
despondent and crying a river to being manically happy. My friend thinks its 
because I’m a Gemini and it comes naturally to me to be “two faced”. Kind of like 
a multiple personality thing. But apart from the alignment of stars during the 
month I was born in being the reason for my emotional state, I think it has more to 
do with a screwed up childhood, the details of which I am not going to get into. 
The Lion King taught me this and I think it’s very relevant here – “yes the past can 
hurt, but the way I see it you can run from it or learn from it”.
Also I have crippling social anxiety, which means I am very uncomfortable in 
being in social situations, and I either end up blabbering too much or being so quiet 
that I could pass of as furniture in the room. Obviously this has had its 
repercussions on my level of confidence and self-esteem.
I also lack motivation. You know those people who work two jobs, plus study, plus 
read, plus go to the gym, plus find time to watch movies, go clubbing, and travel. 
Yeah I am nothing like that. I personify laziness and can be an epitome of 
procrastination. I was never like this. This is something new that I have picked up 
only in the last one year.
So after making a lot of questionable life choices, going through what seemed like 
the worst period of my life where I hit an all time low, making some very awkward 
and inappropriate conversations with people that cause me a lot of embarrassment 
till date, I stopped and did a sort of intervention for myself. It was my reality 
check. Clearly things weren’t working out and I was reacting in the most 
destructive ways possible which led to more grief, pain and despair. 
Something needed to change. And at that moment I realized that something was 
me. After reading some existential and philosophical books, I realized a few things. 
I probably don’t have control over the situations in my life. There are going to 
difficult times in every person’s life. Suffering is inevitable. So how do I rise 
above this? How do I overcome the issues that I have been facing from years now? 
The answer was within me. I was the answer. In an epiphany of sorts I came to the 
conclusion that it’s all in my head. If I learn and train my mind to be happy, to be 
compassionate, to be rational, to be open and most importantly forgive myself for 
my past mistakes and focus on the present, I can kick this whole anxiety-
moodiness problem in the ass. This does not mean that bad things are not going to 
happen to me, it means that in the face of all the bad things, I will make a 
conscious decision to be calm, composed and happy.
Obviously this isn’t easy. But life isn’t easy, and we are all still living it anyway. 
There are days where I just lose my shit and become this crazy neurotic no-chill 
person (you will be subjected to a lot of unnecessary yelling if you cross my path 
on those days), but then I sit back to contemplate and rationalize. And practice 
being tolerant, patient and happy again. I guess it will take its own time, but at least 
I know I am moving forward, growing, and maturing to be “an adult” day after 
day.",14Nov2020,1
106,"Hi everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Making a throwaway to ask this. I recently met someone from an online forum, who I've come to learn has schizophrenia. 

&amp;#x200B;

He posts on an online forum where he has an unflattering rep as an attention-seeker, who has a particular obsession with the ladies that also frequent that forum. \*\*But meeting him irl, it couldn't be any plainer that he's just a generally nice, harmless, and vulnerable guy that's desperate for friends and company.\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

What troubles us is that he quite frequently posts suicidal content. We've tried broaching the topic of his issues very gently, but irl he's always extremely hesitant to discuss it. We're not sure how to proceed. We're not sure how much of that is because of him not having taken his meds, vs him genuinely just feeling that way.

&amp;#x200B;

When he discusses his life with us, he brings up things like his ex, and the troubles he had with her, but we've recently come to learn that part of this is not true, and is actually a product of his schizophrenia. So we're unsure how to discuss this with him. Currently, we're just defaulting to giving him the benefit of the doubt and treating it as real, and discussing it with him as such. Could this actually be counter-productive, in the sense that it's reinforcing his schizophrenia?

&amp;#x200B;

He comes across as a sweet but lonely soul, aimlessly drifting through life, obsessed with a few material goals in his head, like money and women, that he likes to fantasize will solve all his problems once he gets them.

&amp;#x200B;

He does have a few healthy goals, like committing to doing yoga, and starting a business - things like that which we try and gently nudge him towards.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

&amp;#x200B;

\- Have a friend with schizophrenia that posts suicidal things every so often,

\- Not sure what we could be doing to help. 

\- Also unsure as to how to handle topics that are clearly the products of his schizophrenic hallucinations.",14Nov2020,1

suicidal ideation 
Social withdrawal
Emotional instability and mood swings
Rage/anger
Apathy/sadness/depression
Wanting vengeance/revenge 
Overall emotional sensitivity.

All these symptoms are making me wonder if I’m actually a BPD Man

I’ve had two relationships in the past with women who suffered from BPD (diagnosed long after breakup)

I’m wondering if people with BPD are drawn to each other? I’ve always been somewhat antisocial and I think that it might be worth further investigation 

I don’t know if it’s a coincidence that two of my few relationships with women both contained BPD and it was them that initiated the relationship based on my personality.

Makes me want to yell at them and say just get over it, deal with it, make the best of it. What more can you do? 

Idk what this is. My bf has noticed and he kinda managed a breakthrough with me by saying that it's because I've been on the receiving end of listening to everyone else's problems too often that I shut myself off when people express repeating emotions. 

It's not fair on him though... I can't just tell him to stop telling me repeating problems. He's going to be my future partner and I can't get him to repress his emotions so as to not annoy me.

110,"It was some years back (7 years ago) but it came into my head again. it was a 17 year old boy who died. he was found dead in his car during some dead hour of the morning on a cold winter night. apparently his body was half frozen solid, he had bruises on his neck (he was throttled to death) and blood had dripped out his mouth. his neck was broken. the only people he was with that night were three friends. They killed him for no apparent reason and a witness who saw them hanging out before he got killed said nothing seemed out of the ordinary. for some reason when i think of this one i always cry. why? is it normal? I thought of it last night in bed and by the time I was done my bedsheets and pillow were soaking wet.

i know he probably only suffered for a few minutes but those few minutes keep going through my head in vivid detail whenever i remember it. mainly from the perspective of the kid, like him feeling betrayal, wondering why his friends were suddenly killing him. feeling his lungs burn from a lack of air, thrashing about in a dark car going insane, drowning in blood because the neck got broken, heart rate pounding because you can't breathe and you're also being slowly crushed to death as well. And during this no help comes.

He died some 7 years ago, I feel so bad for the kid. I don't believe in ghosts or spirits but I wonder if in the future his parents could get him cloned or something from whatever remained (I read DNA can last up to 10,000 years or something like that) because I feel like I'm grieving over his death (and also grieving for his family) even though I never actually knew him.

I've always had a bit of a problem with anger management. when I get mad, which happens rather easily, I tend to take it out on things. never people or other living beings, but rather things such as my phone, tablet, or pillows. anyway, tonight for some god forsaken reason I decided to stay up all night. stupid, I know.

 it was the last day of unus annus, if anyone here knows what that is, which I was admittedly a bit stressed over. it'd been a long day at school and I came home in a bit of a bad mood. as the evening progressed, I began to notice I was getting rather angry for no discernable reason. i didn't do anything too bad in the begining. just things such as smacking some spare clothes against a chair, or brutally whacking pillows. 

after 1am, when unus annus finally concluded, I began to watch some random videos. and great as my idiocy is, I started watching hamster compilations. as mentioned above, these started making me unreasonably angry until I finally snapped. looking back on it, it makes no sense, but I agressivly bit down on my phone, obliterating the screen protector. after seeing what I did, I started belittling myself which ended in me grabbing a pencil and stabbing my wrist. that's when I noticed something was seriously wrong, as I'd never even considered resorting to self harm. 

long story short: now I'm terrified my parents will discover the broken screen protector and sign me up for anger management classes which I would despite beyond words, I have a cut wrist that I'm also terrified my parents will see and I'm concerned that this could morph from a small issue into a major problem. any and all advice that can be given is heartily appreciated, and I thank you for reading.",14Nov2020,1
113,"I saw that posts like this weren't welcome at the OCD subreddit, so I hope it's okay to ask here.

I've been tagged by professionals as autistic and possibly with BPD (I've heard that's not possible but I've also heard from other people that lots of people are autistic *and* have BPD so I don't even know anymore). That's great (in the sense that I can be directed towards the right resources), but lately I've been so focused on my trauma that I've completely forgotten to discuss about my possible OCD with professionals when I was still seeing them.

I used to have auditory hallucinations. For a few years when I was a child, I was tormented by auditory hallucinations of the sound of a saw cutting through wood. This was because I hated the sound when I passed by a construction site. It was literally hallucinations, like my relatives would wonder why I was covering my ears when there were no loud noises; it was because I could hear it vividly in my head even when there was no actual external stimulus. This stopped. When I was an older child, a minor anxiety of mine turned into a compulsion where I had to do a sign of the cross (it's a Christian thing, IDK if everybody is familiar with it) with my hands literally every other minute. (Everybody around me noticed and just laughed about it, because they thought I was just *really* religious.) I felt like I would go to Hell if I didn't do it. But this stopped. I also went through the classic washing-hands-every-second phase, but this... kind of stopped. I still wash my hands obsessively, but to a considerably lesser/mroe relaxed extent now. (Still pretty obsessive when I compare to others' hand-washing habits, though. I mean, they only do it when they need to. I feel the urge to do it even when I don't objectively ""need to."")

I also went through a time where I couldn't sleep anywhere because I was hyper-aware of the gasses passing through my body. And it sounds so funny/ridiculous but it genuinely tormented me because I felt like all my beds were dirty/contaminated because I was making them dirty with my body. This went on for like a solid year at least.

I'm wondering if it's OCD because if I'm autistic, all of this could be chalked up to sensory problems? I certainly think that most of these are sensory-related. At the same time, however, it's not like OCD and ASD are mutually exclusive. I'm not looking for a diagnosis online, but having someone tell me that I'm probably autistic actually encouraged me to pursue an actual diagnosis so... what do you think? Is it worth figuring this out? Do you think I may have OCD?",14Nov2020,1

Lately I’ve been wanting to open up to at least SOMEONE in my family about my ex fiancée of 4 years. He sexually abused me on several occasions but after the argument I just had with my family it’s a reminder of why I can never open up to them. 

They don’t even know I got engaged to him when things were “good”. They don’t know I’m suicidal, or that the doctors won’t help me. They don’t know that I’ve been diagnosed with depression/ stress caused anxiety and PTSD all rolled into one.
They don’t know that on the two occasions I got a session with a therapist in college I was deemed a danger to myself.


I guess I just needed to vent and get this off my chest to someone as no one else can ever know. Thanks if you read this",14Nov2020,1
119,"I (f20) started recently in uni and the first couple of weeks went well. However, as the studies actually began I have had huge troubles getting myself together and actually studying. I know perfectly well that this procrastinating is causing me more and more anxiety but I don't seem to be getting anything done.

In addition, I have always been overthinking about everything and recently I have felt I have been in a turmoil of negative thoughts. This shows up especially now that I'm living on my own. However, when I do see my friends I am happy, energetic, and enjoy spending time with them. But still, I constantly seem to be comparing myself to others that are doing so much better with everything, being active, getting things done, etc. I have been thinking about getting counseling. I often blame myself for acting, thinking this way even though in theory I have a great, desired place in the university, a decent amount of friends that are also supportive. 

I guess I just want to hear similar stories, what was behind these feelings for you, and maybe even advice that could help me. Thank you!",14Nov2020,1

123,I first experienced sleep paralysis a few months ago but today it's hit me again multiple times. The situation for me lasts for more than a few seconds and involves hallucinations. I read it off Google that longer episodes do involve very vivid hallucinations which can be mistaken for dreams. During an episode I can't even open my eyes but I'm aware of my surroundings and I try to move or scream but nothing works sometimes it feels like I lost my voice.  I wake up rather shook from the incident and feel unable to explain it to somebody else. What should I do to make them less traumatic for me if I'm going to frequently have them?,14Nov2020,1

My hands feel weird, I have constant chest tightness and since yesterday, I feel like I've had something stuck in my throat. I am also worried about these symptoms because about 2 weeks ago I lost my sense of smell and had a sore throat for about 2 days, so I may have had COVID, but I didn't get tested. Now I only have these weird symptoms that come up every once in a while as well as a stuffy nose in the mornings, but no temperature, no sore throat, cough, etc. 

Could this be my hypochondria giving me anxiety? This is the exact reason why I have been taking Zoloft (25mg) and I've had quite a few brutal panic attacks, but I'm worried that it could also be something else apart from the side effects of the medication. Also, I feel like my anxiety was better before I started taking Zoloft and right now, I just feel a lot shittier. When will this go away? Could these symptoms be something else?

Like eat healthy food, shower, brush my teeth, go outside, take a walk, and spend time with my family. I just wasn’t motivated at all to go fishing with my parents, or even do what I love to do. And worse, it wasn’t even easy to sleep at night, or achieve a good sleeping schedule. 

I always ate sweet food, or sugary beverages. The rubbish stays in my room, and stays on my desk with multiple empty glass cups where I drink 3 cups of chocolate milk and 
4 packs of cookies filled with chocolate. And I was always under-weight, for some reason. 

I basically spent majority of my young life staring at a screen with no purpose, and never looking at the real things in life that were supposed to make me happy. Sometimes, brushing my teeth in a whole week two times in a day made me proud of myself. I always knew I wasn’t normal. 

I wondered what it was like to truly feel happy, go outside, and enjoy the small things in life. Some point in my day today, I was thinking of grabbing onto a kitchen knife and stabbing it through my stomach. I had the same mindset when I was eight, too.

133,"Please give me advice

Hi I just wanted to discuss some things on something that really hurted and bothered me. I had a close white friend and we became friends with a Indian boy. We all started hanging out and became friends. He was a racist, homophobic, sexist person and would always comment things about how my eyes are slanted, how big my forehead is, say racial slurs like Ching Ching Chong, comment how flat and small my boobs and ass were and really hurtful things about me. He would always comment mean things to only me though not my white friend. I should of never ever became friends with him but I eventually still ignore the fact that he was so mean to me and still was friends. Eventually I started to get really depressed and wonder why I was and just so low self esteemed. We stopped being friends and never contact each other. I am truly ashamed of myself for being friends with him. My white friend knows how mean he was to me but still talks to him through snap at times. Whenever I was with my white friend and the dude that was mean to me, I felt so compared to my pretty white friend and so ugly next to her. At times I really wished I wasn’t asian. I erased all the pictures of that dude in my photos because it was a very dark moment of my life and I battled with myself everyday looking in the mirror. Now I know that it’s his own insecurities reflecting and that none of his words are true. I’m just bothered because how my white friend still has him on snap and they just talk normal still. I know that it has nothing to do with me but in fact she is my close friend and I don’t feel happy whenever she talks about him or shows me pictures of me, her, and him in the past.

136,"Hello, everyone!

I'm not sure whether posts asking for advice are allowed in this sub. I am open to hearing if there is a more suitable subreddit for what I'm asking.

Recently I (21,F) have had some physical health issues with an unknown cause. I have had a low fever and cramps and weakness in the left side of my body. I also had vaginal E. coli that I treated with antibiotics. This had lasted for around two months before all symptoms stopped around ten days ago. I saw many doctors, including two cardiologists, two neurologists, two infectologists and I did many scans, MRIs and blood tests. My neurologist, who is also a neuropsychiatrist, concluded that my left side cramping and weakness, and potentially even the fever (although it may be contributed to E. coli) are due to the stress and anxiety I have been experiencing during this year. She advised me to do my best to relax as I am organically healthy, and if I can't do it on my own, I am welcome to come and talk to her.

This year has been stressful both globally and personally for me, as the crisis that's all around us induced crises in everybody's personal lives, including mine and my loved ones'. I started experiencing anxiety that is almost unbearable and makes me lose motivation and focus whenever I try to do something, for example, for college. I have never had issues with anxiety before, but I did have occasional depressive episodes. These episodes are not as problematic because I managed to, with time, find healthy coping mechanisms that help me go through the episode (drawing, keeping a journal, making food etc). The anxiety is a new occurrence in my life and I don't have any coping mechanisms at hand to help me through this period. I tried going to a therapist and I had three sessions before I got sick two months ago, but it did not help me much. I'm not sure why, but I simply did not get along with my therapist and I was disappointed with her approach. She would promise to send me some exercises to do on my own for example, and then not send them to me at all, or she would forget that she told me to make priority lists until I remind her, and overall I got the impression that she wasn't paying much attention to what I was saying. My anxiety worsened when I got sick and I even ended up in the ER convinced that I was having a heart attack when in fact what I was experiencing was a panic attack.

Now the cramps are back and so is the fever, from yesterday, when I experienced an unexpected rise in the levels of my anxiety, for no apparent reason. I have been trying to cope with it for the past day and calm down by talking to myself and sleeping, but to no awail. On Monday I will go to my gyno for a checkup to see if the E. coli is back, as it can be a rather boring disease, to see if the fever may be due to it. However, I have no idea what to do with the cramping and the emotional turmoil I'm experiencing. For the record, I live with my parents and follow college lessons online, and I'm able to see a handful of people, i.e. three of my friends that live close to me and my boyfriend. We occasionally hang out, either at their or at my place due to the pandemic. My parents hit a new level of despair when I spiked a fever yesterday, as they were extremely worried throughout my sickness, and that caused somewhat of a scene yesterday evening. They got into a heated fight, and my father expressed his inability to understand the causes of my stress and anxiety as I am healthy physically and that should be enough to calm me down. I tried to explain that this year (with numerous stressful events that I'm not going to get into as that would make the post way too long), and especially these last two months, have been very traumatizing and that although I do feel better since we checked my health with many different doctors who reassured us that I'm fine, I can't relax and will fall back into the worrying pattern once in a while. This only added another layer of stress as now I can't talk to them about this anymore.

My questions are the following: Can the cramping and fever really be a consequence of anxiety and stress? What are some good coping mechanisms when I start feeling an anxiety attack? How can I improve my concentration and motivation in order to focus on other aspects of my life? How do I convince myself that I'm not going to die? On a sidenote: since the pandemic is raging in my country right now, I can't go to the abovementioned neuropsychiatrist at this moment, and the money is getting very tight so until I can get a job again, I will not be able to afford therapy again. That is, no professional help for me until spring when hopefully things go back to normal at least a little bit.

Thank you for reading this far. Stay safe!",14Nov2020,1
138,"I'm not really sure where to start, so I'll try to get out a rough timeline. Sorry if it's chaotic and disorganised, I'm trying my best but my thoughts are rather jumbled. 

It’s not fair that I’m not allowed to show any emotions in this house, because of my brother with autism (M14). I truly believe he knows he has a disability and he’s taking advantage of it he knows it I seen it over the years, and my brother is not diagnosed with any mental illnesses he is just very entitled, he feels entitled for anything He is able to manipulate my mother and father with lies. I’m 100% justified in hating someone whose actions towards you are hateful. That is absolutely zero excuse for blatantly terrible behavior. All my years of living with him I couldn’t express anything, I can’t say anything that bothers me, I can’t say something that made me angry, and I can’t say anything with my brother hits me. 

He can control himself; its a conscious choice not to, and that's not because he's autistic. It's because he's a stale ham sandwich of a human being. He is abusive, full stop. He has control issues revolving around not having any control over his life in general, so he tries to have as much control as he can in bullying the one person he can claim any authority over.

While I’ll fully admit that I don’t have a lot of experience with autism, the children and adults I’ve known are still held responsible for their actions. We’ve exhausted so many options where it comes to help, the mental health services for children are awful, the psyche he sees doesn’t care. Part of me wants him to just do something criminal (preferably without hurting something/someone) so he’ll get taken to a juvenile centre. 

I still live with my family and my brother and will be for the foreseeable future, and things seem to get better and worse in a pattern. I try my best to love him, and care for my brother regardless of how violent and angry he can get there are times where I’m just watching TV or walking past him in the living room and he yells out, “I hate you, I hate you,” and there’ll be one’s like, “Fuck you,” sometimes when he’s really angry he spits on my face and my parents see it and not holding him accountable and I’m just supposed to take it. And then they’ll be times where he would hit my dog and just abuse him because he doesn’t like him. 

I’m saving my money to move out, because I also have to live a life of my own. My parents are telling me he doesn’t know what he’s doing, and he’s not aware of what he’s doing at times, and that I should love him no matter what. And I’m like how I’m supposed to love someone like that? How? And they got mad at me for not answering the question they feel like I should’ve answered. All I hear is tantrums, screaming, swearing at me, spitting on my face. How is that love? How am I supposed to love someone like that? And they expect me to say to ignore all of that, and feel like he doesn’t mean it. I snapped at him before. My mother snapped at him. My father snapped at him. And I’m not supposed to have a right to how I feel? 

Because of this I could’ve never expressed how I feel when I was a kid and and now. 

Many times In the hospital, over the phone, at home. Generally, he seems to go into defence/charm mode and either acts like everything is fine and he doesn't need any help or that it's all my parent's fault (or mine) and that we just need to consider his feelings more.

Am I wrong for feeling this way? Please I need help I have nobody that’s family related that can empathize with me.",14Nov2020,1
139,"What a Time We have been Given to Be Alive. During the most influential and impactful technological part of our time as a Human Being. Multiple Platforms being run, an Internet without an end. No Gate Keepers, except your mind and your own self.

Instagram. It Isn't an art gallery. Its a place to share content. What has caused our society to create self ego from it? To not speak to one another. To avoid sharing. Holding knowledge. Its called Social Media for a reason.......""Social"" ""Media"". Why has society become antisocial as well as built up these needs to not speak with one another, not reply to other peoples messages, comments, not share how they feel about a post of their friends, acquaintance, stranger, if they follow them? Insecurity.

We are all so influenced by this digital age that sometimes I think about what it was before this time? How easy we really have it to market ourselves, our brand, our businesses from the comfort of our own home. Think even 50 years ago, the amount of money it would take to get a print ad out there? Knocking door to door? Leaving Flyers on Cars? Now, all at the palm of our hands and we still avoid it, Why? I really want that to change. We can have so much fun with one another if we use the platforms that we are ALL Glued to on the daily for one another, rather than for ourself. For validation from others.

The other day I learned this: look at your last posts, are they helping others? are they helping yourself? Don't get me wrong, I love posting a bad bitch photo on the gram that makes me feel empowered. That allows me to style, do my makeup and feel free from my own room. I think its wonderful. The lack of interaction between one another is something that has always been such a confusing thing to me though.

Anyway. Post. Post your Content. Post Everyday. Release the need to make it ""perfect"". Release the need of ""oh I can't post too often"" and ask yourself, Why? Where does this stem from? Go inside. Find it and Figure it out. Life is meant to bring us Peace, Happiness and Joy and with creating these barriers that we have ALL fallen into, only makes us sink deeper into our **own** darkness.

Pull Yourself Out of it, For Yourself, to Share with Others.

The Universe is Waiting.

I love you.

Also since i was about 7 or 8 I do this thing called stiming apparently, its when at any emotion of excitement or strong emotions you get these ""twitches"" there controllable if u rlly try but they come and go very fast every day, as a kid i flapped my arms and tensed my face but now its better and i only rub my hands together or shake them very vigorously (its embarrassing) 
I have done some research into ADHD, and i know being distracted isnt all it means but a lot of the ""symptoms"" i  read to, i can very much relate to. 
I get distracted so easily
If someone is talking straight to me sometimes i zone out and i literally wont hear what they have said
I talk excessively
I find it rlly difficult to follow through tasks and goals
I never pay attention to things
Simple things i forget to do

Life is the most precious gift you have. You can’t enjoy anything without it. 

Bliss stems from within it comes from appreciating what you have and not chasing what you lack.

Try meditating. Meditating is great for stress, anxiety, clears the mind, can help relax body, and gain better understanding of self, Better focus and concentration, psy abilities + tons of other benefits.

Try positive affirmations with concise visualization, and clear corresponding emotion. For beginners on how to meditate, check out ""How to meditate for begginers"" by improvement pill. It's short and accurate. 

I highly recommend smudging with sage or palo Santo. Both are pretty good at cleaning negative energy. if its a being that should help. Also from my experience with schitzopfernics amethyst helps considrably with hearing voices(lowered)

Love yourself. Lavender oil=more melatonin=better sleep quality Try meditating, meditating is great for stress, anxiety, clears the mind, can help relax body, and gain better understanding of self as well as potential increase in consciousness and awareness.

.

Evaluate your metrics and values. A lot of people slot of people imagine the summit without wanting to put in in effort for the climb. How much are you willing to struggle to get to where you want. What are you willing to put in the achieve your goals are the questions you should be asking yourself.

nobody limits you but yourself. you can do anything that you set your mind to.",14Nov2020,1
142,"So. 1st of March I started a part time job mixed with an online school. 
Basically 3 or 4 days a week I work from home as a web developer and the rest of the time is spent on school projects (also web). Everything from home. Especially that covid happened, I’ve been spending my days and nights home and as home became my workplace/schoolplace it feels now like I’m always supposed to work. 
From 8to5 I’m working for my company, I take a small break and continue with school projects. 

I’m now at my last and longest school project. And if at least for my job I have schedule about when I can stop working, for school it’s a different feeling. Every minutes I don’t spend moving on my project I feel guilty. My brain is constantly thinking about this project and how to end it as fast as I can so I finally can breath. 
I’ve been totally unable to chill and relax lately. 
I used to enjoy playing video games and smoke weed. Now I feel guilty spending time on my computer not for the project and weed gave me more anxiety than relief. 
So I stopped smoking, I’ve been drinking more and more coffee in hope to stay focus on my project but I reached the point that I need something to clear my mind for the little time I can stop working.

I make jokes about my mental health and I feel like it's just a cry for help, that someone will take me aside and ask me if I'm ok, but the thing is I'll say I'm fine even though I'm barely keeping it together. Like I'm not feeling much joy about anything, I'm just feeling kind of hopeless. Sometimes I feel like I don't actually exist and that all of me is just in my head and that the rest of my body is like a robot or just not connected, if that makes sense? I engage in risk taking behaviours that end up making me feel worse about myself. Every now and then I'll get panic attacks and feel like my throats burning and that I can't breath. I feel like everyone hates me and I don't blame them. 

I stay keeping all this to myself and it's just eating away at me. Like I feel like a landmine, that if anyone steps too close I'm just going to go off, if anyone asks me how I'm really doing I feel like I'll just break down. I thought that these feelings would eventually just go. That this was all just normal, that it's just me, that because sometimes I'm ok that I shouldn't worry. The more and more I go through these feelings the worse I end up feeling though. It gets more common to happen until most of the time I'm just sad and tired and frustrated with myself. I end up eventually just feeling numb and empty inside or just sad. I really don't want to feel this way it's so distressing to me, it's suffocating. It's like this is all that's occupying my mind and so I really don't even know who I am as a person or what I want out of life, instead I feel like I'm wasting my time and everyone elses.",14Nov2020,1
149,"Hi guys, I hope this is the right place to post. I frequent this sub often and find many of the posts really helpful in knowing that there are genuine, decent people who will reach out when you are showing distress.

As a placement therapist I wanted to find out if there were any 'frequently asked questions' of sorts that you guys have for your therapist/therapists in general.

Partly for my own interest but also to help understand what some of the key issues or barriers might be for people in therapy and perhaps how to address some of these. I am not looking for 'condition specific' really (though I will try to help there too!), but for some of the often occuring that might come up.

Any thoughts, comments or questions welcome. Have a good day all ❤️",14Nov2020,1

I’ve had them infrequently for a while, but they’re getting more frequent recently. But I don’t know why!! 

I wouldn’t say I’m a particularly happy person but I wouldn’t really say that I was miserable either... I’m pretty sure I’m not depressed/I don’t have any other mental health issues.

151,"hello fellow redditors, i’m a 16 year old residing in an asian country who started becoming opened up to the topic of mental health at around 14 years old. i’ve never been one who worried about my own mental health since growing up i’ve never had any issues with it. however as i grew older i started seeing certain symptoms that i was told were anxiety symptoms. i know where this looks like its going, but i’m not trying to self diagnose. here’s my issue, i have no idea if my worry, overthinking, weird emotional breakdowns and distrust towards people are rooted from anxiety, or is it just my personality in general. I really want to seek professional help but being 16 im still considered a minor and seeking any form of professional help right now would mean details of the session would most probably be given to my parents, and as much as i love them, i dont want them finding out that i have this kind of problems im struggling with. would any kind soul be able to suggest some solutions or maybe a way for me to be clearer about my mental health? in some way maybe control some of my urges to overthink etc.",14Nov2020,1

When you feel like you’re failing not only yourself but everyone and everything around you, you start hating yourself. You just don’t want to bother with anyone or anything. You go to parties or get togethers and try to be normal and have a good time but you can’t seem to enjoy yourself. You can’t relax. There’s always something on your mind and it just takes away from who you were and how you feel. You feel like nobody cares about you even if there’s people that do, and they show it.  You just feel like they’re there to fill up their own egos or something along those lines. They have some other motive for trying to be there for you. You can’t trust people anymore. You think everyone’s out to get you, or you can’t open up to anyone because you’re terrified of getting hurt for the billionth time. 

I cant remember when I started hating myself. My life. I’ve thought of suicide since I was four.  I know I don’t have the balls to do it. I know I don’t. But I still have to live with deep emotional pain and pretend I’m okay on the outside.  I don’t understand how people can have normal lives, or even be happy.",14Nov2020,1

158,"If you think about what you need to be happy, you might think about achieving something in your career, or a relationship, or something you own. All of these things have something in common - they're conditions for happiness. As human beings we naturally get attached to goals and the status quo.

The bad news is that not everything in our career goes as we would like, relationships can end, possessions break and are lost. The good news is that you can enjoy what you have right now and be happy, even if the only thing that you possess is the ability to breathe in and out. 

By letting go of our attachment to things that we believe we need to be happy we can actually live calmer, happier lives. Of course its great to enjoy the things we own, the people we love and our work - but accepting that life will change and that we don't need external conditions for happiness reduces the suffering we feel when things don't go as we hope.

159,"Ayt so let's get started,

Me, 20 M final year university student had a somewhat traumatic childhood. Well I was able to avoid any sort of pain from it because of this happy ""state"" I had created for myself. In my happy state I rarely have days when my mood is low and usually it's a 8/10 mood. I continued living like that from my childhood up until 2019 where i couldn't keep up the happy me. I didn't realise it at the time but I found out from many different people that I had changed. My mood was a constant 1-2/10, I had become suicidal and decided to get known to mental health services. And then covid happened. 

Fast forward 8 months later and I was able to switch back to the happy state. But now I knew that the depressed state was a thing and that's where all the pain I hide goes. And now I have been having moments where the depressed state makes an appearance and my mood switches from the upper end back to the low 2s instantly. So I haven't been on any medication and I'm waiting for my nurse to contact me again. Bare in mind she's contacted my 3 times over the course of the year. Each time saying, I'll be in touch again by the end of the week so I no longer have much faith in that. Now I know this is not a proper diagnosis but I was just wondering if anyone had any similar experiences or have any clue as to what's going on?

For the past few days I haven't been able to do anything because I have to be at her side 24/7. Her hallucinations and delusions are getting extreme and keeps getting worse by the hour. I'm tired of spending hours convincing her to visit psychiatrists and hospitals and then being let down by the system. I've tried everything and there's no one to help. Medicines are not working.

164,"Small background- I’m F24, living in Netherlands as an expat. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety around 6 years ago but I never organized my therapy, I just took the medication they gave me. Continue reading to find out why I didn’t take therapy. I’m an expat so living far away from my family and childhood friends since the pandemic. The last 2 years I have suffered nothing but loss after loss. half way through last year I met my current boyfriend and he’s amazing with everything and totally not one of my problems at all, he makes it worthwhile. But my rosy glasses are falling off now and I’m struggling with my job, I don’t know what to do with my life. I’m at a massive junction with my life now, I want to settle into this country and get myself into my life long career. I feel like a failure, because I never finished university, and I can’t afford to start again now. I isolate myself from everyone outside my household and family because I’m convinced that they are horrible people who do nothing but try to get under my skin. 

As soon as I start talking about my feelings to try and process them and find a solution (out loud) I hysterically cry. I mean total breakdown cry, can’t speak can’t breathe ugly snotty cry. It’s disgusting. I know that I should go to my doctor, discuss all this with them and I think it’s the right thing to do. But I just get so embarrassed with the hysterical crying. and I feel like they’re gonna write me off, with the pandemic everyone’s mental health has taken a hit so I should just deal with it. but I can’t, feeling like this is affecting my everyday life, my house is a mess, I’m barely taking care of myself. 

How would you suggest I go around getting therapy without having a complete episode each time?

166,"Almost exactly a year ago, I had a really awful complete breakdown and had to go on leave from my job. I had a lot of untreated health issues, a lot of repressed trauma, stress from working several jobs for years while trying to take care of everything at home, difficulties at a new job, and a death in the family. I went to a psychiatrist barely able to speak because I was so depressed.

The road to getting where I am now definitely had its difficulties, and for awhile I spent about 90% of my day resting. I would take a five minute walk every day and then need a four hour nap. I was put on an antidepressant, which before we found the right dose increased my anxiety to the point that I was afraid of everything. I finally got brave enough to return my psychiatrist’s calls, and we found a medication dose that worked.

My leave expired during covid, and I decided to take a chance and resign to start something new. I went back to school online, kept my part time job, and put a lot of energy into my health and my relationship with my husband. I got deep into therapy to address the trauma and worked with a lot of things that were uncomfortable but, ultimately, useful. My health improved and I started running 5ks.

This week I had a phone appointment with my psychiatrist and she said that I’m doing so well that she would like to do a trial of me tapering off my antidepressant. I know this is a direct result of all the hard work I put in. She also said that she thinks I’m talented enough to do anything I want in the future.

I know it’s not easy, and everyone has different timelines for their progress and levels of privilege that let them access more resources and opportunities (I recognize that as a white cisgender female in a middle class family I have a lot of privilege). But it does get better, and I’ll be holding lots of space for anyone else on a similar journey.",14Nov2020,1

maybe people here thought or still think I am a serial killer or something, it's tiresome to explain everything I do while being afraid if people would think I have bad attentions.

and I requestion everything I do like to do, I tell myself, maybe it's not good for me if I would pursue this passion that I really do like, it happened to me with video games, learning some subjects in the technical field, even sometimes watching movies and wanting to become a filmmaker.

I know that there are some people on the gov watching Facebook, so when I see some posts related to something in my past or to something I know or do, I have to explain it in the comment, what does that mean, and why I do like it and sometimes I even like posts that I have no interest on just to let them know I am okay with that and leave me alone.

174,"i’m only 14 years old. maybe i’m just being overdramatic because i’m a teenager. that’s at least what people tell me. i have a therapist but she think i’m okay because at my last appointment i thought i was okay because that’s what happens to me. My next appointment now isn’t until after thanksgiving and i don’t think i can stand it.

here’s the full thing has happened to me recently: so 2 weeks ago the most important person in my life who i told everything to and thought about constantly and my main source of happiness left me. we were dating for over a year. now my friends are making fun of me and calling me “a crazy ex girlfriend” but that’s besides the point. i have been acting like this long before we broke up. It’s part of the reason why we broke up. That and my OCD and constant compulsions to tell him things. Also for his mental health problems too. He told me it’s the reason why he still doesn’t want to talk to me. 

Here’s why i don’t understand what’s wrong with me: Well I don’t know how to fully explain it without just listing the things I do that seem to be not normal. It feels like way more than just sensitivity. 

•I only think in extremes and those extremes change very fast. (One day something will be amazing and absolutely wonderful and the next day it will be terrible and the worst thing that has ever happened. )

•I go from being very productive and hyper and “happy” to being very sad and attention seeking and constantly feeling like i’m getting stabbed and i’m impulsive and then i just go into just a full on depression and can barley move and feel that everything is empty and not worth the energy. these all only last 1-2 days at a time. 

•everyone tells me that i am always thinking irrationally and need to calm down but it feels like the rational part of me is just watching it all happen but does nothing to stop it. It’s like I enjoy this??? But i hate it. But it feels like it is me.

•I get extremely angry for no real reason and usually when I express my anger i make it seem like a joke so that i don’t hurt anybody 

•I constantly hurt people on accident but when I hurt them it hurts me 10X worse than I actually hurt the person.

•My biggest fear ever was my boyfriend leaving me and when it happened everything feels completely empty and pointless and like I am no longer a person. We were only 14 isn’t this ridiculous? When I was around him I accidentally would start acting very child-like and I just clinged to him and I constantly wanted to talk to him and stopped wanting to. 

So, yeah those are just a few things and not even the worst ones. They just kind of concern me the most. I haven’t always been like this, it comes and goes in waves that last for months. I will go from being like this for about 3-4 months to being “normal” and just extremely anxious all the time for a few months. This is the second
time it has been super noticeable and super bad. I think the breakup triggered all of this this time. He also broke up with me last time I was acting this way but we got back together. I understand why he does it but I don’t think we will get back together this time. He said we might if we both truly get better. I’m so hard to deal with right now. I’m so scared that my friends will leave me too. I wish I could leave myself. I’m not asking for any kind of diagnosis, because I know you guys are not professionals and i’m sure nothing like that is even wrong with me. But if you know of anything I could research or look into or just if you feel the same way as me. I just need help and I feel so alone right now. I feel so empty too and It doesn’t go away.",14Nov2020,1

There are always going to be people that hate me. I need to stop focusing on the one person that hates me and start focusing on the people who love me. I can’t tie my worth to what one person thinks of me. 

I’m also not the same person I was a month ago. My mental illness isn’t an excuse for what I’ve done wrong but it is the reason. If person can’t see that and they can’t forgive me, it’s their problem not mine.",14Nov2020,1

185,"Is it normal that i don’t feel sadness or happiness? it’s usually just excitement or irritation. Is there something wrong with me? things that are sad dont make me sad anymore. Things that are supposed to bring happiness dont really make me happy anymore. I barely leave the house. I barely feel anything. I don’t even like talking about emotions. It sucks to not be able to relate or talk to people in a deep emotional level because i never know what to say. Im confident and cocky, sometimes too much. But why dont i feel anything. Sometimes i listen to sad music or watch a sad movie just to cry once in a while but in the end i never really felt anything. I never believe in some stuff like love. Its not that theres no reason i shouldnt. I just dont want to.

Im content with everything. With what ive had past and present. But i just dont feel anything.

187,"A couple of hours ago my father sent me to the supermarket to get some stuff. 
Since this store regulates the amount of people, during the pandemic, with shopping carts, my father gave me his chip, because we didn't had a matching coin.

After I came back home I realized that I put the chip into my pocket with a hole that I forgot about. My father was sad cause he got this chip as a present from my sister.

I immediately left the home to search for this thing, but with no luck. Because I was too embarrassed, angry and disappointed at myself, I didn't go back home, and just stood there. After about 30 minutes my father phoned me, and told me to come home. I was still fucking angry at myself.

When I left to search for the key, I hit my head multiple times as strong as I can. And when I got back into my room, again. I do this quite often when I'm angry at myself for doing something wrong, with no issues, because my arms are the equivalent of a toothpick. But this time I nearly passed out. Right now I only feel self hatred, and want to die as miserable as possible. My sister and father think that I'm angry at them, wich I don't really understand, and makes me feel even worse, because I'm not even capable of showing emotions right.
I just really hope that the worst thing imaginable will occur to me.",14Nov2020,1

189,"So the person in question is my older brother, and to be fair - he has seen some terrible shit and has some issues of his own. But, the problem is there is nothing that I do or say that isn't subject to his comments and ultimately ends up in him shouting. For example, 

Me: I'm ordering a beef burger, do you want something?  
Him: I don't eat beef burgers. 

Me: Okay, you can order something yourself  
Him:\*comes up to me\*, oh you are ordering from this \*restaurant\*, they have chicken burgers too. Suddenly starts shouting, ""Why do you lie to me,"" ""You said it like this"". and stomps off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'll be singing to myself and he'll start shouting. I'll ask him not to move a chair, and he'll start smashing doors and stomping. Basically this happens a lot and I'm tired of it. He has had a lot of traumatic experiences and is going through a lot, so I cut him some slack, but now it's getting difficult for me to deal with too. Every time I object to him shouting, my family says that ""family has to deal with this."" Sometimes he will come ask me about something totally unrelated to me, or my field or interests and when I respond "" I don't know"", he starts yelling ""If you don't want to tell me, don't tell me. Don't lie to me."" Or he will smash the door and stomp out. I mean I'm really tired of having my guard up all the time in my own room.

 Honestly, I've been in a really bad state mentally recently, and these are the little things that are making everything so much more difficult. I mean I'm usually struggling too, but I close myself in my room when I'm like that so I don't unload on others.

190,"So over the last couple of days I've felt weird, I feel like my whole world turned around.

this all started when school ended and online school started, at first, i thought it was so cool, that i could just skip classic i felt like it and wouldn't get in trouble. But it started to change when i started feeling lonely i mean really lonely i missed my friends and everything. Our school got remodeled and now looks completely different so when the school opened everyone was excited but i was still forced to do online school,so a couple of weeks go by and my mom finally budges and lets me enroll in physical school. And yesterday was my first day back but it felt weird, i saw my friends again but they weren't the same they were different but the same people i knew before. So the whole day i am feeling lost as the school got twice and big with the expansion and the only person i can still certainly call a friend is the only freinds i kept in contact with during all of quarantine and online school and i so far have only seen her in one class. after that i went to my freinds party and it was all well and fun but there were people i didn't even know there who i had seen at school but weren't a part of our main group i didn't mind them until they started talking bad about one of my friends the only friend who had kept contact with me. i kept my cool but i was so pissed and the rest of the night i felt lost they were all talking, and i was just laying there not knowing what to do as i had  no  prior conversations with them and had no idea what their interest where so i left after a while im not saying i had no fun but for most of the entire day that this took in i felt stuck in the past. it was like i had died and came back and they were completely different people to me.it was like they had written me off and when i came back they just said ok and moved on. at this point in time i feel so lost and sad i don't know what to do to help myself get out of this bad place

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: i went back to school to a completely new environment and it feels like im stuck in the past while everyone i knew had moved on and im left to play catch up . this has led me to feel  extremely sad and lost",14Nov2020,1
191,"It’s   true. I’m not sure if anyone told you yet, but you’re allowed to   disconnect from the healing journey for a little bit. We get so caught   up in doing all of the things that sometimes we forget that we are   allowed to live. To be alive isn’t a series of habits and routines and   practices that overtake your life. To be alive is to find the present   moment, indulge in it, and to take a little bit of it with you. This   trauma healing game is exhausting; wake, meditate, journal, do yoga, set   intention, be mindful, listen to the podcast, go to the gym, don’t   drink too much coffee, shower, brush your teeth, and so much more, and   that’s all before 7 am. I don’t know about you, but some days I want to   chill.

So  what do you do when  you are healing CPTSD and need a break? You ask  yourself this question:  Do I need a break today? I always ask myself if *today* is that day because often I find that I can keep going. However, on some days, like **today,**   I have asked myself that question and decided that the thing that   serves me best is to exist without judgment that I’m not going to do all   the things. The pressure we place on ourselves to be great is often   exponentially more overwhelming. We look at ourselves in need of fixing   and measure our healing by missed opportunities instead of new   baselines. We say things like I wasted my day, or I should have done   this/that. But is that entirely true? The truth is that in healing the   impacts of childhood trauma, sometimes the best thing we can do is   forget about it for an afternoon.

But   what about all the people who say you have to show up for yourself   every day? Yes, what about them? I am one of them! I am probably more   aggressive about it than most because I believe that the only way you   genuinely heal is by being assertive in your choice to always show up as   your authentic self. And let me tell you this, sometimes my authentic   self needs some couch time with a bar of chocolate, a glass of red, and   mindless romantic comedies; yeah, I said it. Here’s the truth about  that  day. It comes along once every few months, and I take advantage of  it  because on the other 89 days before that, I go hard, and on that  day,  when I ask myself the question, *Do I need a break today,*  and  the answer is yes, I take it. And I ask myself, do I need this, or  am I  avoiding something? We all have in common that we can lie to  ourselves,  but we always know the truth.

Stop being so fucking hard on yourself all the time. The rest of the world will do that for you.

Until next time my friend…

195,"I am not in a good place mentally at the moment and have never really liked the idea of sleep at the best of times. Recently however I have developed a hyperfixation on a specific form of media (one individual in said media to be specific) that has been extremely detrimental to my mental state. It is possible that the emotions I feel regarding this fixation are being channeled from other causes, but I have thus far proven unable to separate them from the fixation. I do not wish to go into specifics on this fixation as it is humiliating, but knowing that it is there and has a massive impact on my mind (and body, even; I have had “adrenaline spikes”—I don’t know if it’s actually adrenaline but that’s all I can think of to describe it—when at my worst because of it which leads me to feel even worse on those bad days) is vital to understanding what I want to say.

I don’t want to go to sleep because my dreams are cruel. They torment me with things I dearly want but do not/cannot have regarding the fixation. Last night was the worst in a while in that it was actually fairly realistic compared to many others I have had before, making the sudden exit from the dream all the more impactful. Even just thinking about this to write it down makes my heart pound, a feeling I get at the start of a spike. I try to distract myself from it during the day but it is always on my mind in one way or another. I have felt awful before, I have dealt with depression, insomnia and anxiety for the better part of a decade at this point, and yet this feels so different yet familiar at the same time. 

Every week I seem to get one bad day and night. I’m hoping today was the bad day because I don’t want to feel any worse, yet I can’t just sleep through it because of the dreams. I’m not sure what I seek to gain from posting this, but people always say writing things like this down is supposed to help.

Hello,

My name is Dauneen. I am a mother (single) and an artist . I have one son, he is my lite, and 4 doggos. After some research, I recently admitted to myself that I have CPTSD. Funny when you have the time to actually stop, and reflect, how much you can learn about yourself. I can thank Covid-19 for that one thing. I, as with many others, was laid off when Covid hit. That said, my job was horrible so getting laid off was a blessing in disguise.

The thing I realized was that even though I had been telling myself for many years (I am 56) that a strong person did not let their childhood dictate their behaviors, that was just what I had been doing. Although I am strong and tenacious,  the effects of my childhood have held me back. I have  been functional enough to achieve many of my goals, I just get stuck at a point and blow things up. It is funny how your subconscious does that you can be going along fine and BOOM.

I began drinking and drugging at 12 and that is how I have spent the majority of my life; drinking and looking for something that I now realize cannot  be found outside of myself. 

Just a short runthrough:

My 20's were spent waiting tables and getting drunk and/or high on meth. 

My 30’s I dropped the meth and just continued to drink - a - lot.

At 36 I became a parent, and 3 months in, I became a single parent.

At 43, I got sober and have been so for 13 years (the past year or so I have been Cali Sober) 

I have spent these 13 years focused on raising my son, he is an AMAZING 20 year old. 

Now at 56 I find myself unemployed, no people outside of my son,  and Covid-19 is raging.  Now that I have had time to reflect, and research,  I have admitted that I suffer from CPTSD. 

So much stuff between those lines…...

**Here is my solution:**

I am focusing on positivity. I am creating a community for positivity. I am reading positive readings M, W &amp; F at 8:30 PST on YouTube. If you even want to check out my readings,  you can find them by googling - Shea The Rise of Daun

I have tried many affirmations that state “If you listen for 21 days it will change your life”. This may be true for some, but I have found for myself, there is so much more to it than that. I am creating a safe space to go - kind of like  a prayer group but instead of praying to a God, I am focused on reminding myself how AMAZING I truly am. I welcome all to join as we are all AMAZING.

Anyway, I am healing, if you too feel this may help you, join me. Blessings.",14Nov2020,1

201,"Um..I am sorry for the vague title but this is something I have been dealing with for a long time. It's currently 2 am and I have eaten 3 pizzas. I feel awful about it but the part that I keep getting stuck on after these late night stunts are that ""I wasn't even hungry in the first place."" Now I have been debating about this most of my life and the only conclusion I ever landed on was that I was just horribly sad and ate my feelings but today I was fine. I had a fun time with my family but it was like clockwork. I picked up my phone, ordered something to eat and voilà! I am back to feeling like a pathetic loser. 
I used to have a job and I worked for 15 hours a day but I quit after 9 months. I used to order late at night after coming home and then pass out. I quit in Feb 2020 and I stopped with the late ordering and get myself in place mentally and physically. I went to therapy and gym and I kept up with it. 
Corona hit the world and that was another reason to keep away from ordering.
Then 2-3 weeks ago I thought ""Hey I haven't eaten out from out in like months. Let's do it."" I ordered and ate it followed by feeling horrible. I was put out for sometime but it was like taking in second hand smoke after leaving cigarette for a long time and now I am right at the beginning.

Help me. I'll take harsh criticism and any tips.

Because the only other reason is that I have turned into a full fledged masochist and am destroying myself in which case I am doing a good job.

202,"I haven't seen anyone talking about this and I am genuinely concerned.

There is this YouTuber named Marina Orlova, AKA [HotForWords](https://www.youtube.com/user/hotforwords). She was one of the first viral sensations during the early days of YouTube and I remember watching her a lot when I was in middle school (I'm 27 now). For those of you unaware, she is a very pretty Russian woman who made etymology videos where she spoke about the origins of words and phrases. She used her physical appearance as a way to draw in viewers but the videos themselves were pretty educational and of a decent quality for the time.

She completely left her channel about 6 years ago for unknown reasons. There are some videos currently on her channel from 2 years ago but I believe they are re-uploads. Either way, her channel has been pretty vacant for years up until about a month ago. Since then, she has been uploading some very odd videos. First of all, she seems very thin. She has always been thin but she seems very thin in her recent uploads. Second, she often seems very out-of-it, as though she is in some kind of trance. Third, the content itself is just... odd. I don't really know how to describe it so I hope that you will check it out for yourself. She also created an OnlyFans. Now, I am 1000% in support of people having an OnlyFans and people doing sex work. However, I when looking at some of the things that she has posted on there (what's public, at least) it just seems so unlike her, or unlike what she used to post on the internet.

I am not sure what to make of this. I don't know if she is actually struggling with her mental health, if this is just a way for her to make some money, or both. I just have been thinking about this for a few days because I feel very stuck. I always feel stuck when I see internet personalities or other celebrities struggle like this because I always want to help but I know that I can't.

204,"I’m 19. I’ve never had a friend group until January of this year. We’re all kind of fucked up misfit children. 

One of those friends was one of my best friends, twice! She bullied me in middle school, and we were kind of forced to make up by a (shitty) mutual friend but it seemed to work. (Spoiler; it didnt- nothing about her changed.) 

You can never disagree with her because she can’t stand to be wrong. This leads to a lot of arguments between us and her feelings being hurt because you disagree. Finally we’ve had one that has ended in her not contacting me at all, ever. Not even in our group chat. 

We haven’t talked for weeks, not that I haven’t tried. I’m not about to send her a whole shit asking if there’s a real problem or how she is, because I don’t feel like it’s fair for me to make all of the effort if she’s obviously not interested. 

Another friend and I had a falling out last year due to our boyfriends being equally shitty, but I’ve since left him. She is still with hers, but we have started talking and spending time together again (I always told everyone how much I missed her while she was gone, but I was too afraid to reach out to her because the first time I did it was too early and she was still being a crackhead.) 

The two of them don’t get along, either. I feel like I’ve just let them go because they brought me so much drama and negativity. Now it’s more drama. 

On Halloween we all got together to play games, and it was just an absolute shit show. The first friend (the bully) hardly spoke to me all night and made it clear she didn’t want me around. Her equally as shitty roomate was there but I felt bad for her. She didn’t even know us and that friend of mine didn’t do anything to introduce her or help us interact. 

One of the girlfriends tried to fight everyone. Her boyfriend didn’t even care. Another girlfriend didn’t want to be there obviously, and it made the vibe so anxious. Her boyfriend didn’t do a good job for her, either. 

My boyfriend and I couldn’t wait to leave. 

It made me not want to hang out with that entire group ever again. I just hated the way it felt. I have always been in groups where I’m unwanted and uncomfortable and I’m so tired. I thought I finally had some good friends, but now I just feel like this is a waste. 

And one of our male friends always asks us to take his girlfriend everywhere who isn’t really used to our group. We basically never get to see him by himself anymore either and that same girl from the beginning also used to date him, and she still seems to feel like she missed her only shot at a ‘good’ boy ever since. It seems pretty clear when they’re together that she still feels that way despite saying she doesn’t, and it seems like it makes his (aforementioned) girlfriend uncomfortable. She doesn’t like him being around other single chicks so she is always invited everywhere, hence the previous issue...

It just sucks. That same female friend AGAIN hates love, then wishes she could find a boyfriend, then tells me she’s sick of seeing us as happy couples. 

I just don’t know what to do. I want to avoid every grouping of these friends because it just sucks and stresses me out. Sorry for the long post. Idk if this is within any rules but I just... theres a lot and there’s more and I’m just really tired of these people and how they bring negativity.

208,"I've known for years that something was wrong with me, every therapist or mental health professional I have seen has said my below symptoms are normal, perhaps because I seem like a 'normal' girl. I am typically lighthearted, and seem like good company, but I know there is something very wrong with me. 

There are long moments in time when I seem to disassociate from myself. In these moments, I think about seriously hurting - even killing someone. The thought does not scare me, but it does not excite me. I do not want to hurt or kill someone, it is simply that I am not opposed to it. What scares me most is this applies greatly to my parents. I am still living at home (I am not yet 18) and there are times I find myself in the kitchen, holding a knife in my hand, while they are asleep just thinking about it. Again, its not like the thought excites me or makes me happy like I have read with many psychopaths, but it doesnt seem to bother me. 

 Psychopaths also have a tendency for hurting animals then evolving to humans, I have absolutely no compulsion to do this, instead, I just feel a strange urge to kill those who have wronged me. 

I believe this may apply to my parents because of their overprotective nature of me when I was young (and now) 

Keep in mind, I am turning 18 in a few months, and some of my restrictions include: 

\- curfew of 4 pm or right after school 

\- only ""approved"" friends meaning that they have been to our house at least 3 times, my parents have met their parents, and the friend has completed a tox screen (drug/alcohol) 

\- No eyeliner 

\- no fake eyelashes 

\- no acrylics 

\- my phone is to be checked every hour on the hour, and it is put in a safe at night at 8 pm. 

These restrictions have isolated me from most people my age in my life. I genuinely do not have friends. Which means the idea of harming others extends to my school, etc 

I also do not have any reaction to watching someone else get hurt. Screaming in pain etc doesn't bother me 

The only exceptions to this, like i said are animals and if I truly love someone. In this case, I feel these 'urges' toward the assailant. It is not out of anger or pain or sadness... it just... is. 

When I am not in these disassociate periods, the ideas terrify me. But its not like I am a separate person, like you see with DID, I am just... blank. 

Some thoughts I have had are 

""I wonder how stabbing myself in the stomach would feel"" 

""He deserves to die for that"" 

""I should skin her alive."" 

""I wonder if I could paint with her blood"" 

That being said there are smaller parts of my day I don't remember IE: 'I know that I took a shower and did something on my computer... I just cant remember what"" Also, I have NO recollection of a LARGE part of my childhood. 

It is important to note that I can control and curb these urges quite easily, at times I will write about it, or just watch/listen to the most detailed crime documentaries I can find. 

I know this is a weird cocktail of symptoms but if anyone has any idea what is wrong with me i would love to hear your thoughts.",14Nov2020,1
209,"My sister has autism and as such she often does things in certain ways. I kind of mentally shut down whenever things are done in a way that isn't a PARTICULAR way my brain has chosen to be the ""right"" way. Obviously this leads to a lot of clashes.

Recently, she was getting cereal and she put her bowl in the fruit basket because it's the closest surface to the cereal cabinet. For some reason, this made me extremely uncomfortable. I shut down. I asked her if she could do something different and she said that she couldn't and I got really frustrated and angry.

In hindsight I realize that wasn't okay for me to dictate, and a lot of things that make me uncomfortable are not my place to decide. But I still did it and I feel like I can't control it, my discomfort or my reaction. But I still feel like I should have been able to control it, like I'm a giant asshole for acting the way I did. A monster.

Does this sound like any kind of illness? Because if not then that means I'm just a manipulative monster. I need to know what to do.",14Nov2020,1

214,"My sister (19F) recently told me that she has had a history of abusing animals. She told me that it started with her pet hamster as a child and has only escalated from there. Here is a timeline of what she told me:

-10 years old: got her first pet, a hamster. She did things like put him in a shoe box and shake it, throw him across the room and throw him down the stairs before killing him by crushing him under her foot. She told me that she felt incredibly guilty and cried for months. 

-10 years old: got a replacement for her first hamster. She did the same things to this one, minus the murder, and was slightly less severe with her abuse because she didn’t want him to die.

-12 years old: got our first pair of family guinea pigs. She would thump them on their backs with her fist when no one was around. She would also pinch their bellies to make them squeal because she liked the sound they made. 

-15 years old: she lost her temper with the family conure (small parrot) and threw a water bottle at him, permanently crippling him. She told everyone that it was an accident while she was out of the room.

-17 and 18 years old: two cases of strangling guinea pigs to make them die quicker when they became ill.

-19 years old: got a pair of kittens from the cat rescue we volunteer at, she started strangling one every now and then with a wand toy for a few seconds at a time. 

-19 years old: started abusing our our youngest sister’s hamster the same way she abused her previous ones, only this time trying to bait the cat into attacking it as well, resulting in death.

-19 years old: strangled a kitten to near death with her hands while volunteering at a cat rescue, only stopping at the last minute.

Needless to say I’m extremely disturbed by what she’s told me and I’m not sure what to do about it. She won’t forgive me if I tell have others what she told me but if I don’t more animals may be at risk. I’d anyone had any advice it’d be greatly appreciated.",14Nov2020,1

217,"I’m small. I’ve always been small. I’m a man but I have no masculine traits. At least not physically, and I do not know how to cope. 

I’ve been picked on because of my size since elementary school and it has definitely put a dent on my self esteem. Especially when it comes to relationships with women. I’ve always felt like I’m not worthy. My size makes me a boy, and since that’s not going to change, I guess I’ll never be considered a man. 

The feelings I have today started last weekend when me and my girlfriend was talking about tinder and if we’d swipe right on each other on tinder. I told her of course, she’s the most beautiful person i know. But her response was a bit different. At first she had to think about it and then she said “No I don’t think so”. “I’ve always swiped right on guys who are at least 1.9m or taller, just because the make me feel safer, more secure.” So I asked her if she still feels this way and if she does not feel safe when she’s with me and we are out. She continued to say no, but that it’s okey because she values other things with me more. And I didn’t think about it any more that day. But now it really starts to eat away on my confidence again. I know it shouldn’t, but I can’t keep it away. 

I’ve really tried to work on these feelings related to my height but somehow people love to bring it up. Some examples are: 
 
A high school a girlfriend of one of my best friends and I was out walking and she wanted to do some shopping. She decided to buy a new pair of shoes because it felt like she was “walking with her little brother”.

Another ex girlfriend told me “it’s so nice that you are short, if you were tall I would never have a chance on you”.

To the same girl my mom defended my height by telling her that I had tall sisters and that the genes are good, it’s just that I’m short because of all the cortisone I got as a baby.

While there’s more, these are some of the experiences that pop up into my head. I just don’t want to have to compensate for my height anymore. I don’t want to be accepted despite of my height. I want to be desired and loved without any thought or opinion about my size. I’m 26 and I want to start to be treated like a man, and not just a boy anymore.

I’m so tired of these feelings this inadequacy, of feeling undesirable, unattractive and unmanly.

Do you guys have any tips for how I can break out of this spiral and just not have to care about this anymore?",14Nov2020,1

219,"So I’m (22F) into my second week of SSRI treatment for MDD and GAD. I know during this period it can trigger fatigue and an increase in already existing mental health symptoms.

Is this normal? Say I wake up at 4-5pm, I’m exhausted by midnight and fall asleep again by 1am. Yesterday I woke at 6pm after sleeping for 17 hours straight, and ended up passing out again about 12:30am? Will this pass? Also any advice on how to wake up more during the day?

How do your parents react?

229,"
I (22f) simply just dislike a lot of things in my life. I just feel like I’m destined to live a mediocre life and face financial hardship till I die. I have signs of GAD but no formal diagnosis as I didn’t pursue the psychological therapies service my gp refereed me to. This was mainly due to difficulty with my retail work schedule due to them expecting me to have full availability. I was not assertive enough to say no to shifts and didn’t want to request days off as I was scared they would fire me if they found out I had mental health issues. 

I have tried to manage my mental health and some days are better than others but it’s an ongoing struggle. I know I won’t self harm or try to kill myself but I’m always so exhausted. Honestly because I have trauma from being around suicidal friends/family and the thought or blood makes me feel faint. I don’t want to live but too much of a coward to die 

My mum and sister also have a history of self harm and depression. So I try not to burden them with my feelings.  I have a good relationship with my younger sister but my relationship with my mum is very unpredictable. My mum can be very irrational and short tempered coupled with her immature behaviour the relationship is strained. It’s hard to have difficult conversations with her as she cries and breaks down and apologises that she can’t handle talking about my problems. She makes the situation about herself even if it’s not intentionally. She stresses herself over me and my sisters troubles till she’s physically ill and makes us feel like we can’t tell her anything.

Her love feels toxic and shallow even when she’s at her best. But she’s my mum and I love her. She tries her best in her own ways but I can’t really expect much from someone who’s clearly got their own burdens.  

She does bring me stress sometimes as she’s bad with money and gambles as well as is irresponsible. We are hundreds behind on utilities and rent but won’t get kicked out since it’s government housing. She tells me not to worry about it sometimes but other times demands money from me and gets angry I’m not helping her out her mess. It’s not like she makes bad money either she makes enough to pay all our bills but her ex my sisters dad was paying her money to cover full rent and utilities but stoped last year. 

I’ve tried structuring with my life with a planner and embraced hobbies like art and plant care. It helps most of the time being able to see how productive I am but can also make me feel like crap when I’m not completing tasks.

I’ve tried online CBT a few times and am currently on mild antidepressants. 
I genuinely feel like I peaked in high school and wished I could be the same person who looked forward to the future. I feel like I’ve already dead and just an empty shell. Even when I feel happiness or laugh I can feel the hollowness at the back of my mind. I used to be full of potential, slim and pretty with a lot going for me. I had amazing grades living with my dad, was athletic and slim. Had great friends and was so happy. Now I’m obese and one break down away from giving up on life. 

My poor mental health has lead to me quitting several jobs as well as university twice. Recently I just cried and broke down in my first lecture and left the course as I knew my mind couldn’t handle it. 

Recently I’ve been struggling with my dads declining health (dementia, car crash, strokes etc. I’m scared he will pass and I can’t visit him due to COVID

I hate my retail job and constantly worry about money but feel too overwhelmed to do full time hours or confident enough to get another job. It’s a never ending cycle.

I left my dads care to live with my mum towards the end of high school despite her losing custody of me when I was 12 due to being an unfit parent. He wasn’t able to care for me me properly after falling into depression after loosing custody of my other half siblings to his ex wife. His health declined a few years after that. Which I feel worse for as voluntary abandoned him to move back to my mums city. Previous traumatic experiences include bullying, abusive relationships and sexual assault and a 2 yr stalker police case which made my anxiety increase tenfold.

I feel like there’s a voice screaming inside of me as I smile and seem fine on the surface. I just needed a place to vent and posting on reddit is what it’s come too. I’m just so exhausted.",14Nov2020,1
230,"OK. I just read a post that pretty much sums up exactly how I am feeling right now. This might be long and I might as well add a TW because suicide and SH is mentioned, as well as my ED.  


I was so excited to go back on this medication that had helped me some 6 years ago. I took it last night and it DID help me sleep, which is amazing because I don't think I have slept so completely or so well in a LONG time. I had nice dreams (though quite weird at times) that were perfectly normal and unrememberable, which is also normal. You don't always remember your dreams, and that is OK. Anyhow, I had slept well and woke up at 1:15 pm after about 13 hours of sleep, refreshed.

&amp;#x200B;

That is where it starts to go to hell. Yes, I was refreshed and feeling rested, but then, about 10 minutes later, I began to feel like something wasn't quite ""normal"" with me. I usually have impulses to set fires from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. It has always been a constant, consistent thing for me. That was totally gone. I feel NOTHING. OK, you are saying ""well that is a good thing, isn't it?"" but the answer is no. It is not. 

&amp;#x200B;

These urges have been a part of my life since early childhood. I just recovered a memory from when I was about 10-11 years old where I would go out into the big field in back of my home and burn tent caterpillars off the branches of the trees. They were EVERYWHERE, and I used to delight in the fire consuming the nest (and sometimes the branch!) and watch with glee as the flames just crackled and danced for me. I always had water with me too, so I have always been a conscientious pyromaniac, at least. I also chased the fire trucks whenever they got a call out of the small volunteer station that was not even 2 blocks from my house. EVERY time. Sometimes I had to give up the chase because you can only peddle so fast on a bike or run and the fire call was too far away, but sometimes, it would be near enough that I would get to watch the guys in funny suits and helmets grab a large hose and make the smoke and flames go away. I loved, again, watching those flames climb and crackle and pop. Our family also had a fireplace...and you can guess where I'm going with that. I actually learned from a VERY young age (I am talking before elementary school, and even before Kindergarten which is age 5 here in the US) how to build the fire---the logs, the paper, open the flue, everything. Yep. It has been a life-long thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, as I take this medication, that has been taken away, and I not only feel devastated at the loss of that part of me that, and let me be clear about this, I DO NOT WANT TO LOSE (please don't try to ""psychology"" that one on me because you can't understand it unless you have gone through it, and it is not something I ever debate, even with real psychologists/psychiatrists) because it is truly part of my personality. Believe me, psychs of all sorts have given me ""tools"" to help me find something to ""replace"" it...but I do not want anything else to ""replace"" my love for flames. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, gives me the same kind of pleasure that they do. I have other kinds of pleasure from my family and kids, and that is all well and good (and I won't trade those feelings either!) but my love for flames is always going to be a part of me, and I will not change that PERIOD. 

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that I also do NOT wish to keep doing things that are illegal and will get me in trouble, and that is the paradox of this disorder. I want my flames (like all true pyromaniacs do) but I don't want to be told where and how I can enjoy them. Unfortunately, since I live in society and I can NOT afford to move out to some country location where I have tons of land to burn shit as I please and not a soul would know, I am stuck in-between wanting to burn til my heart is content, and behaving myself so I don't get thrown back in prison. One year was enough, thank you very much. Ick. Soy meat...totally gross and now I have stomach issues because of it (I am suspected of having an ulcer) and because of the stress I had gone through. PTSD anyone? My psych now wants to see if I can get that official diagnosis because she is sure I suffer from it.

&amp;#x200B;

The point is that I am not happy taking this medication anymore. Again, I think my body has changed too much (being sober for so long and getting older) and because I had quit drinking, my real disorder had come to the surface. I think the drinking (which has been a part of my life from age 14 to 46) was just covering up the fact that I was totally infatuated with a ""dangerous"" thing and I knew deep down that it was not acceptable in society to want to burn stuff all the time. I can't tell you how many times I had attempted suicide because of this conflict. I actually still have attempts in my recent past (a bit more than 4 years ago--right before I had stopped drinking) and I still cut a lot more than I care to admit. The cutting helps when I can't burn something. The urge is so strong, that if it is denied, I end up ""punishing"" myself for not being able to soothe my urge and for being such a fuck-up in the first place.   


Thanks for reading.

231,"# An interview with therapist John Loppnow on the basics of EMDR

Hey everyone! This week I decided to collaborate with one of my subscribers to talk about EMDR on his [Presence and Practice podcast](https://www.presenceandpractice.com/post/andrew-yang-spirituality-asian-american-mental-health-bitcoin-emdr)!

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is one of those techniques that seems strange at first. It isn’t really what someone would consider within the realms of traditional therapy. But when I was in counseling school and researching about various therapeutic techniques for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), I discovered that there were pretty convincing studies that showed that EMDR was effective in some cases.

As I was planning the content for Heem Publication, I knew I wanted to talk about EMDR to perhaps help demystify what it was. But to be honest, I’m not an expert. That’s when I reached out to John Loppnow, a subscriber who I’ve been chatting with over the past few weeks on Twitter.

John Loppnow is a licensed Marriage and Family therapist, has a certificate in EMDR training, and is based in California with over 20 years of experience. He also runs [Loppnow Relationship Center](https://www.loppnowrelationshipcenter.com/), a private practice, with his wife Sungshim Park Loppnow.

Below is a timestamped Youtube video of the podcast where we talk about EMDR. I’ve also included a transcript of our conversation underneath. If you want to learn more about me and why I started Heem Publication, feel free to listen to the full podcast.

# Presence and Practice Podcast Interview

From \[30:18\]

Andrew Yang: What exactly is EMDR?

John: EMDR is “Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing.” That comes from Francine Shapiro, and she’s a therapist who did research, and if she could rename it she would just name it Reprocessing or something around that, but because the research started with EMD, it has this long name, which basically people just use the acronym, EMDR. And it references how she learned about it, which is the eye movement. She was taking a walk in the park in 1987—her research came later—she was thinking about something upsetting and she noticed her eyes were moving back and forth, and after that, she felt that the distress was less. And so she was curious! I tell this story because it is the origin of EMDR, but it’s also fascinating—as you’re going on your everyday life, who knows, maybe you’ll discover something that is a powerful part of how we function as human beings. So she just realized, “Oh wow,” when her eyes moved back and forth, the distress of the experience or the emotions went down. So, it’s fascinating to me. 

Andrew Yang: Okay, wow. So could you briefly describe what a session might look like? Because it seems a little—it’s not normal, or a typical experience I think. 

John: Right, because it’s more than simply listening and offering—of course, that’s the core foundation: good listening, good empathy, that’s a component of it. And there might be a few sessions before you get to EMDR. Some people get to it in the first session, some people you gotta listen, take some history. There are eight phases of which I won’t name all of them but you can Google it. But it would be listening, it would be identifying a specific memory that is distressing, painful, upsetting, and it could be as big as a major trauma that people think of—a car accident, physical abuse, it could be that, or even more subtle like being left out or being yelled at. We’ve all been yelled at, and that’s not emotionally small, but it’s what we normally think of as small, because it’s like, Oh, we’ve all been yelled at. In a sense, we all have some trauma to deal with, the way Peter Levine and Stephen Porges talk about trauma. I want to name this so we know how EMDR functions. Peter Levine talks about trauma as going through something painful without a compassionate witness, which we all have experienced.  

Andrew Yang: Yeah, under that definition there’s a lot of trauma!

John: There is! There absolutely is. And Stephen Porges—these are therapists—Stephen Porges says trauma is a chronic disruption of connection. So it’s that prevalent. In a sense most people could benefit from some EMDR, but usually people come when there’s enough distress. So we’ll zero in, we’ll make sure we’re grounded, we’re in a good place, so we can return to that. That’s really important to the therapist and the client, that you’re here now, you’re grounded, you feel strong enough, and then you go back to the painful memory—that’s guided by the therapist. So the therapist is the guide, or the shepherd, or the pastor to that, and stays in tune with them, and what Francine \[Shapiro\] found through her own experience is: eye movement, back and forth, that is guided by—there’s a light bar that some therapists use, some therapists use their finger or a pen, some use audio that goes back and forth, just a simple beep, some use tapping on the knees or the hands. You can even do a little bit yourself, like a butterfly hug, where you give yourself a hug and tap on your shoulders left and right. These are things you can do when you’re feeling distress, though when it’s guided by a professional, they know when to stop and pause, guide and redirect. And that’s the “unusual” part: you’re feeling this distressful memory, and the therapist is having you do some eye movements periodically, and they don’t last that long. We may do a number of sessions but they last 10, 20, 30-ish \[seconds\] back and forth, and the therapist will just check in and say, What do you notice? 

Andrew Yang: So what about that experience of the eye movements, the touching, and thinking about the traumatic experience, what about all of this formula, why is it effective? Why does it work? 

John: We have some intelligent guesses and research. One, it integrates the entire body and nervous system. Left and right brain, our nervous system, different parts, parasympathetic to sympathetic, so it integrates the nervous system, so that’s one way we can understand it and look at it. Just to reference Dan Siegel, he says his one-word definition of mental health is Integration. So when we integrate differentiated parts and link them together, that’s how we move towards mental health. So this eye movement can help with that. One reference that I’ve heard people say is, there are drugs that we give people or that we take, but the doctors just know that it works, they don’t know the mechanism of how it works. There are medications that all of us as a population are taking, but we don’t know exactly how it works, so EMDR is like, we don’t know exactly, there’s theories out there, there’s an adaptive information processing model that Francine talks about, so it integrates parts of memories and our nervous system that are disconnected that we reconnect, and the eye movement helps, or the touching on the bilateral—alternating stimulation—helps. So it just integrates parts of us that are disconnected and we reintegrate it into our system. 

Andrew Yang: I did a little bit of research on EMDR when I was in counseling school, and one of the aspects that I think works is that with trauma, it tightens up your body and it locks you down. And it’s really hard for you to re-experience that trauma. What EMDR does is that, as you go through that experience, as you’re doing these eye movements and this physical sensitization stuff, it almost desensitizes the traumatic experience so that you can dive into it more and it allows you to experience it in a way that doesn’t lock you down and it’s not so powerful. That’s also part of the process of why it helps and why it works.

John: Yes. You re-experience, you get to be in touch with the pain of it, it will be upsetting, and I would say in a session, the upsetting part is 10-20 minutes, 20 minutes of feeling distress, and it can be intense, but also it can just be mild or moderate, depends on the experience, knowing that you have a compassionate witness with you. You are relationally connected to another human being, and these mechanisms help to be exposed to the painful memory, you’re connected to another person, and they help facilitate that “fight or flight,” so that you’re not engaged in running or freezing, you might experience it but then you know you’re connected, and it softens that reactivity. 

Andrew Yang: Right, and just for some context: one of the ways that people process trauma, or “get better” from trauma is to re-experience it in a way that doesn’t lock you down. That’s a scary thought because it was such a painful experience for a lot of people, but that’s why it’s important to have a compassionate person next to you who will love you as you go through that experience. Your definition was it’s without having a compassionate witness, but that compassionate witness is there now who will help you and love you while you go through that, and that’s key to this whole process. 

John: And for people who believe in a higher power or believe in God or believe in Jesus, that can be accessed—I mean, sometimes trauma disconnects us from accessing that presence, but that’s why another human being helps us access, “Oh, God is here,” and then that can actually be a greater resource. There is something called post-traumatic growth. That trauma extends our capacity too far, but then when we experience healing, we have increased capacity than before. So there is hope in when we get healing we actually have more capacity. After EMDR people often experience the emotional distress is hugely relieved, and I’ve seen so many clients say, “This is weird, I feel way better, I don't understand, but I actually do.” That’s the in-person response. And then, the negative beliefs about themselves, about the world, they shift, and are transformed right in front of my eyes. And that’s one reason why I do love that, and then their physiological experience is more calm. 

Andrew Yang: Yeah, because trauma is not just mental, but it absolutely is physical too. You have a strong, biological response to the memory. Another question I have is, What situations, in what contexts is EMDR useful for? 

John: A lot of research around post-traumatic stress disorder, veterans, war, rape, car accidents, the big traumas that we all think about, definitely those. Especially multiple experiences—single incidents like a car accident, those are fairly readily taken care of, but all the big traums are, and just regular old anxiety that we all experience, phobias are hugely helped, it can help with depression, even chronic pain, and I’m just naming the ones with research. Therapists are finding ways of integrating it in all aspects of life, but those are the big ones with the research. 

Andrew Yang: One of my last questions is, Does it always work? 

John: It is a magic pill and it heals everything—No, obviously you know I’m joking. It is very effective, 80% of specifically trauma survivors have experienced no symptoms after three sessions. I would say almost with everyone, does it work, we’d have to define what work means, does it reduce tension and fight-flight, I would say it does, but that doesn't mean there aren’t other aspects and other venues and avenues that we have to engage to experience fullness of healing. It’s been super helpful for all the clients that have used it, it doesn’t heal everything 100% but one of the fastest ways of experiencing healing, and building on your strengths, or Asian-Americans, or men, sometimes people don’t want to speak the content of the trauma. And with this you don't need to. You just need to be able to report to the therapist, “Okay I am experiencing it.” But you don't have to actually say it, which is a huge freedom for a lot of people. 

Andrew Yang: Yeah that’s a really good point, especially with an honor and shame culture, I can imagine saying, “Yeah, I don’t want to tell you what I’m going through.” 

John: And they don't need to! They just need to be in touch with it, and as long as there’s a trusting relationship, like okay, the client’s actually there, you don't have to tell me the details. 100% no need.  

Andrew Yang: That’s crazy. One of my last thoughts is that, with any intervention that a therapist suggests, it’s not going to be a 100% success rate. And the reason for that is because we’re human. Each one of us is different, and we respond differently to different things, and so to me it’s encouraging that EMDR for the most part seems to be successful. And if you’re going through trauma, and if you’re going through depression or severe anxiety, maybe it might be helpful for you to talk to someone and get EMDR. Treat that as an opportunity to better yourself or to get help, but if it doesn’t work, I just want to encourage you and say that it’s okay if it doesn't work because it’s not going to work for everybody, so don’t be discouraged, don't think that something’s wrong with you, just know that sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. John, thank you so much for sharing all that because, honestly, EMDR can seem a little strange and a little weird to somebody on the outside who has never experienced anything like that before, and so I love that we can have a conversation and you break down how it works, why it works, the history behind it, and just to normalize that experience so that hopefully other people might be more open to the idea of getting it. 

John: I hope so, because I do see it bring relief to people, to myself, to clients, and that’s such a gift for people to experience.    

Andrew Yang: Love it. Alright John, well thank you so much for this conversation.

233,I've been looking into online counseling and was interested in trying out talkspace. But I was wondering if anyone else has any good recommendations. Also if you have tried or are using it do you feel like it helps?,14Nov2020,1
234,"I am struggling with motivation, consistent working habits, and honoring my own deadlines. The project-planning stage is very engaging, but when it comes time to buckle down &amp; work for as many hours as is needed over as many days as are needed, I falter. I have a problem working when I'm not stimulated. These limits apply to work for my business as well as work for my passions, which causes a spiraling set of emotions as I wonder why I don't pursue what I identify as my passions. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been told I'm too hard on myself, and that the failure to meet perceived deadlines may cause a negative feedback loop of stress. Regardless, these mental cycles perpetuate, to the point where some days I am crippled by an energy-less depression and I waste time being hedonistic. I am now left looking at the shambles of many areas of my life needing my attention, and am unsure how to procure becoming my best self. What are some appropriate avenues of thought, psychology, or education to become apprised of?",14Nov2020,1
235,"We had quarantine from april till june and now we have another one that started in mid october and will MAYBE end in 6th of december. That's 6 months, then a 1.5 month pause and now 1.5 month atleast of quarantine for a person that cannot live without human interaction. To make shit worse I managed to get into a relationship in those 1.5 months and now I can't meet her untill this shit ends. Also unlike in normal school where I am pretty smart in online school I want to rage, smash some stuff or run a marathon every time I sit down to learn. It is impossible to concentrate. When I take distractions like music and phone away I just end up blankly staring at the unfinished work. I just defocuse my FOV and hibernate - just dose off and start thinking about nothing. It's impossible to learn this way. Now I am walking around my house irretated, angry, low on oxitocin and constantly high on coffee. If this shit doesn't end soon idk what I will do... I can't distract myself because I am also the kind of person that feels guilt and feels like I am wasting my life every time I don't do something productive so idk what to do. I was mentally very stable before this but now  every second exponentially increases my desire to scream out loud or punch a boxing bag (that I don't have) till it breaks apart.",14Nov2020,1
236,"i always thought i had a perfect childhood and looking back i was so happy but the older i get the more worried i am that i have some sort of repressed memory. it’s so strange to me that i began masturbating at 8 years old and i know it can be normal for children but the weird part is i watched porn. i don’t know how i found out about porn and i have very little memory of it but i rember searching loads of key words into youtube back in the day when it was really unregulated and i’d watch porn. i wasn’t really aware of what i was watching at the time but i just knew it felt nice, and looking at children that age i can’t believe what the fuck i was doing. i don’t know how i found out about porn and i’ve always had a really horrible feeling when i’m alone with any man, even my family members so i don’t even know like if something bad happened to me but yeah. and this meant i was hyper sexual from 12 years old onwards with random men on the internet and it’s all so fucked up looking back at it.",14Nov2020,1

241,"I sent this to the board of directors(easy to Google hospital staff) after witnessing horrible treatment in the PWard at my hospital a few weeks after I got out.

Dear Members of the Board,


My Name is ^^  this is my story 2 weeks ago,

I'm calling for a full investigation of the psychiatric ward in your hospital.

I was admitted, complaining of migraine and light sensitivity upon entry to hospital. It was my husband who brought me and thought I was manic. Based on NO scientific evidence only a inaccurate diagnosis given by the mental health industry and with a 5 minute interview with Dr. H. The other catalyst was lack of sleep for 3 days, and my phone and email got hacked.

My concern is Psychiatry as a whole.
 
There is no doubt sick people in Hospital and I do need to go there from time to time when I cannot regulate my sleep/mood but the treatment is unfair cruel and archaic and unsanitary conditions and needs to stop today.

What you need to know about me,

When I was 7 my father taught me to program computers, I was a adept at programming by 13 , Making my own video games and hacking...My father died in my arms when I was 17, and the rest of my life has been about barely surviving that trauma.


My brain runs very fast because it speaks the language that not many people understand this is often confused with racing thoughts.. It’s name is binary, but it's been misdiagnosed within the mental illness as 'racing thought'
 
Everyone I made friends with in ***  was an artist. 
 
Once I was admitted to *** there was at least four other gay youth that have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. All of which too young and could not possibly understand nor were informed of their legal rights to counsel so I advised them to file review panel board complaints as I am very proficient in the legal system.
 
There is something happening at ** , The first day I was admitted I had two people confide in me saying that Dr. H. was abusing them sexually or emotionally while they slept. I asked them all to write down what they were feeling and what they were thinking and I'd submitted them to a psychiatric doctor for review.


I believe this is being done through Oculus Rift or a new technology we have discovered is being used to harm people called Remote Neural Monitoring 

Several people are here for absurd reasons, R who advised me he has a brain tumor and an elderly lady clearly showing signs of dementia or some other mental deterioration. I understand these people are here for their own protection, but they are still not being treated properly..

As well, I witnessed a grave mistake on the doctors and nurses part, which will NOT be forgotten.

Patient G admitted to me he was suicidal, I told his doctor, they released him next day. He then called me Sat afternoon telling me he was cutting and suicidal...

I had to call 911 to get him to another hospital.
 
Despite the fact that my first few days I admit I was disruptive in Hospital I was merely trying looking out for patient rights, including my own.
 
Label us as you wish, but treat us with respect, we are all someone's child, we are all human beings.
 
As you absorb what I have just told you ask yourself this, Would you have treated Robin Williams, Kurt Cobain, Alexander McQueen, or any other famous person who has killed themselves this way???
 
If this does NOT change, I will be forced to release this information I’ve gathered to the masses. Changing locations isn’t the same as changing how you treat us. 
 
How can you possibly treat us if you don’t really understand what it is like.

242,"TL;DR: sick of penis size being the punchline to jokes in media, the defining factor of someone masculinity, and the reason so many men are anxious and depressed. 

——

I came across a Facebook post on a page that allows anonymous submissions. The post was regarding how we need to normalise “small” penises (small being in quotation marks as there is no normal size). The post seems super topical too due to November being a time to bring awareness to men’s mental health. 

The post was truly wholesome and addressed many of the reasons it’s dangerous to have this negative connotation. The reaction was horrific. While there were people that were supportive, the majority were laugh reacting and tagging their friends in the comments, making jokes and outright going against everything the post was against. 

Now, the males that were joking should be ashamed, as they will be the first ones to speak up about men’s mental health if a male friend is depressed or worse (which is a real concern from this level of body shaming and ridicule). The women should be equally as ashamed, especially with the level of body shaming that goes their way. 

It even goes further than just friendship groups. Films, television series’, books, etc. will all justify/joke about male villains being horrible people due to their lack of size.

It’s become such a societal norm to pick on penis size, I don’t think men’s mental health was ever thought about but now it’s a little more spoken about, it seems too late to normalise and reduce the stigma. 

I understand there are people far worse off when it comes to body shaming, women, the trans community, etc. but this is not a competition. 

I just ask, if this is something you joke about with your friends (maliciously or not), think twice as you don’t know who it’s affecting mentally. 

I will stay anonymous though I will say, I have never had an intimate relationship because of this negative stigma as I am self conscious. I have honestly contemplated ending my life. It is a serious topic. Please be mindful.",14Nov2020,1
244,"I've experienced VERY uncanny synchronicity recently, that left me believing I'm going to die soon and be reborn as my sister's child (her due date is in December, so pretty soon). I won't go into details on this synchronicity, but let's say the lyrics of a particular song aligned themselves perfectly with external circumstances and triggered immense fear and anxiety. I've experienced a couple of similar ""meaningful coincidences"" since then (also in the past I would experience events aligning themselves in really strange, almost improbable ways, particularly in times of great stress or life changes). Prior to that experience I was obsessing about a bump I found at the base of my jaw that I believed was an enlarged lymph node (haven't consulted it with a doctor cause it didn't grow or gave me any discomfort so I kinda forgot about it). Needless to say I'm petrified and try as I might, I cannot shake or logically talk myself out of the feeling that my death is imminent. Apart from that I've been experiencing strong health anxiety (also fuelled by the pandemic) and anhedonia of sorts (I can't feel happy or enjoy stuff to the fullest cause I believe my happiness will bring about some disaster later on, so even previously enjoyable experiences give me feelings of guilt and remorse now). I've also been through some relationship struggles lately. I'm in my early 20s and in good health (at least physically). Can anyone relate to my experiences? Obviously not looking for a diagnosis, but knowing that other people had something similar happen to them would be a relief.",14Nov2020,1
245,"Like I’m at a good place mentally at the moment and I’ve never self harmed, but I often find myself fantasizing about cutting or more often lashing myself. I think I’d never do it, but something about it seems exhilarating - the taming of the flesh, the aspect of tremendous self control and the act of being in power over pain. Anyone else feel this way? I’m sorry if this is triggering for anyone.",14Nov2020,1
246,"I work away from home... 5 days a week i go in. Do some jobs set by my bosses to keep us busy... i don't feel I've been particularly productive or accomplished anything of worth... I go back to the small little room that they provide me with. Maybe get some food if i have the motivation. Other than that i just lie in bed and look at the four walls that surround me. And repeat... and repeat. 

This weekend i drove 3 hours back home for the first time in 5 months.... surely getting away would clear my head. I get home... initiall happiness from seeing my mum and sis. It wore off when i saw i still feel the same. I've just changed the colour of the walls i stare at. Even for a day. Only for me to drive the 3 hours back tomorrow. Was it worth it? 

I'll be going away with work in a few weeks. I'm gone for 4 months. It's the second christmas in a row I'll be away from home. And the second birthday in a row I'll be in work. There's just no excitement. Inside, i feel nothing. Empty. Maybe going away to a new place will help me. But will i have that 5 minutes joy when i come back? Only to find it's just back to staring at the 4 walls again?",14Nov2020,1

248,"So all throughout high school and middle  school I never had that many friends and I was fine with it. I’ve never been one to want a ton of friends, just a few Solid ones. Well in 8th grade through high school I had rumors spread about me which lead me to loosing friends and people disliking me just based off what they’ve heard. Over time I’ve fell out with a lot of people and within the last year the connection between me and my one close friend started to fade and now we never talk anymore. So now I pretty much have no one besides an old ex that I’m still friends with and talk to occasionally.
I used to want a close friend but now I don’t even care anymore. I think the fact that I’ve lost so many friendships has made me just not care and I’m losing interest in talking to my ex. I look at his as a friend instead of an ex but I don’t care to talk to him as much and I’m honestly fine with just myself and no friends. Is this normal to not care to have any one ?",14Nov2020,1

250,"Well this sounds like a dumb question but I’m curious about the different experiences trans people have had in psychiatric hospitals. I’ve been to one before but this was 6 years ago before I was out. 

I’m a 22 year old trans man and have fears I guess about being outed while there. I “pass” 100% so that’s not the issue here. I don’t know if it’s safe to divulge this information. I avoid going to the doctors office or hospital unless I absolutely have to in fear of how I may be treated for being trans.

Divulging that information is something you have to do in a lot of medical situations but I don’t think it’s necessary in this one. So... idk, I’m just scared for a few reasons and this is one of them. I’m thinking about admitting myself but if I have to go through shit then I’d rather not.

I have some questions that anyone can ask but really I’m looking for reassurance from trans people that have been admitted.

Can I leave any time I want to if I voluntarily admit myself?

I’ve never been to an adult psych ward. How is it different from one for adolescents? Is it much different?",14Nov2020,1
