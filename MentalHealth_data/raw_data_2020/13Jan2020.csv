3,I am always really really anxious and overthink everything and when I'm with someone I feel like I did everything wrong and they are losing interest and that they dislike me then over text if I'm talking to people (especially my girlfriend) I always feel like I fuck up and that I'm doing shit wrong but then occasionally I get moments of clarity where I read through the messages or think of what actually happened on whatever day and it wasn't as bad as I thought it was but those moments are so short and I don't know why I constantly feel like this but it is rly damaging and I have suffered with depression for a while and I really don't want anxiety as well it would be so bad so I'm hoping someone can diagnose me with not anxiety so I can be stupid and believe them.

I have a small youtube channel where I post music-related content, and recently put together a list for people out there like myself (who deal with anxiety) of 10 albums that boost your mood! On the list are synth-pop, rock, and video game-inspired albums that have really helped me through the years personally. No rap or explicit lyrics.

6,"I don’t know what it is. It’s been going on for over a month or two. It’s a very subtle feeling. Not like a feeling, but more of a thought that just won’t go away. I feel very empty. My head feels light, tired, if that makes sense. I don’t really feel anything. I’ve noticed this for awhile now. I can’t feel emotion. Whatever emotion I do feel, it feels fake, like I’m just watching. I can’t seem to feel anything. I can have emotion, but I can’t feel it. Nothing feels real. Everything feels like a simulation. I don’t know if it’s depersonalization/derealization or what. I’ve also noticed a mania effect to it, like a hyper sense of intelligence, understanding, and whatnot. I’m not bragging, but I’ve noticed that ever since this feeling started, I got a more massive understanding of the world, like I can understand more complex and adult feelings, systems, concepts, etc. It feels almost like I can do and understand anything, anything that is humanly possible at least. I feel really light, my mind feels more than human. It feels like someone else is controlling it, like my mind is somewhere else, if that makes sense. You think this would be great, to have a huge boost in intelligence like that, but it isn’t. I don’t feel real at all. Everything feels like a dream. I don’t know what this is. I hate this feeling.

10,"As a kid, I was not informed about any sexual sensitivities that could occur to me and my well-being. I was a cheerful kid who knew nothing but to play with people my age. I was happy even if my extended family frequently tease me occasionally. In retrospect, I tried to be cheerful I tried to keep my spirits up but my introversion manifested the time I was in high school. I didn't gave any thoughts of everything that occurred to me up until my college graduation. I stopped being cheerful, I stopped being happy the time I was sexually abused as a kid. I don't remember when exactly or how long it happened, I just remember those vivid memories on what happened. I don't even know what to call it - sexual abuse, sexual harassment - I just know that its not rape. 

My memories haunts me quite often, I tried to go about spending hours of watch time on YouTube, I finished the animes my brother sent me but it goes back. I remember my uncle calling me out frequently, right after my aunt called in for lunch. He would hold me back and say that he has something to show. I remember seeing his genitalia and him making me touch his shaft. I remember being shocked and amused by it. I don't remember much but those vivid memories made me question myself, made me built up hate towards men similar to my uncle. I didn't thought of it before because I was surrounded by guys my age. I started working Dec 2018 and that's when I realize that I'm traumatized. One specific married guy tried to seduce me or flirt with me. His subtle touches made me cry and I mentally broke down the moment he keeps on insisting to take a ride with his company car. I live along his house is located so for the first few months, I had to bear and wear a face, and just to reason everything I can to avoid his invitation. I was not comfortable. 

I pondered why other women in my office doesn't have the same sentiment like I have. I could witness other women making sex jokes with other married men, other men joking about cheating with beautiful and sexy women younger than their age. I couldn't bear it. Its not a joke to me. In all honesty, I make sex jokes before. I love sex jokes or any sexualized jokes but that's when I had friends (people within my age), but hearing sex jokes from older men makes me sick. It makes me terrified and horrified by the fact that they had sexually harassed me within the office and on site. Sexualized stares, unnecessary comments, I'm not comfortable. 

I wondered why I'm too sensitive about this and why I can't move forward with life. Why am I having a hard time? Top management are also older men but I don't get terrified of them, I see them like my father. I love those higher bosses. I go back to the time that I was sexually abused as a kid. I hated my uncle, I wanted him to just die. There's a saying that says 'forgive and forget' but the aftermath of it is that I have made myself think of being sexually abused by the people around me. I constantly imagine being forced to do anything sexual in an office setting. Contrary to before I started working, I constantly imagined being raped and murdered. My thoughts also wandered to those stuffs and even ask myself questions that I couldn't even answer: (some of the questions stated below)

1.0. If I get raped, will I like it or will I be disgusted by it. 

2.0. If I get sexually abused, will I report it or will I keep it in.

3.0. If I get raped, will I finally be able to kill myself or will I still put up with it. 

4.0. If I get pregnant, will I abort or will I let it live. 

5.0. If I get raped, will I fight back and have myself get murdered or will I be mentally insane enough to be the murderer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Going back to forgive and forget, I realized that people who had it similar to mine will always forgive the person and forget the situation but will never forget the trauma it had caused. I thinking back my uncle I'm not entirely sure if I have forgave him but because its been long due, I didn't matter anymore, I just don't want to be involved or to be around him. Even if it doesn't matter anymore, no one can really take away the trauma that it had caused. Its the aftermath of any incident that we have to bear, we can be tough about it, we can pity ourselves about it, but it will still be there even if it doesn't matter anymore. That uncle is fighting for his life with an illness that I don't give a fuck about (on knowing) and my mother, being a pure soul, volunteers every single time and I'm just here conflicted whether I'll be happier if he's dead or I've tormented myself by so much because of it. I just want to forget or erase this trauma but I couldn't help but cry whenever my mother brings him up in our conversation (mentioning that he's will be at my hometown to receive treatment at the nearby hospital). My boyfriend, once, talked about this and I cried franticly at his comment to just forgive him or to let him tell my mother about all of these. Even if I want him dead, I don't want my mother to have a conflicted feelings when she's helping him in his medications. Even if I want to tell the whole family how shitty my mental state is partially because of him, I couldn't I could just cry and mentally torn about everything, about the aftermath of that incident. I definitely blame myself for not going against that aftermath, I made bad decisions and cultivated a wrong perspective in relationships because of it. My mind is mostly about sex, in a bad way, I'm trying so hard to become a better person but its a hard life with a messed up mental state.",13Jan2020,1

15,"2019 was a rough year for me. I went through the whole progression of suicidal ideation to planning out my suicide to having to call a hotline because I wanted to attempt the suicide. Then, I talked to a therapist over the phone who had me answer some questions where they later scored me under ""severe depression"" but I couldn't believe it. In fact, I told the therapist over the phone that that was wrong. I probably more mild/moderate depression rather than severe depression. this all progressed in the course of June - November.

Long story short, I suffered childhood sexual abuse which I just now only recently addressed back in August. I grieved it, and it manifested into those suicidal thoughts. I identified with the abuse so so much that it was hard to feel like a survivor when all I felt like was a victim. And when I think about these things that has happened to me, I think to myself ""oh this isn't THAT bad"" when to others, it seems to be absolutely horrible.

I'm an undergrad studying psychology so I've learned the symptoms of depression and can clearly see that that was what I experienced, but at the same time I just think it's so bizarre that I could ever be depressed. I feel like I'm talking around in circles at this point, but is it normal to feel this way?? To feel that the abnormal things that's happened to you are normal?",13Jan2020,1
16,"Hi, there's this girl (21F) I'm interested in who is obsessed with anything to do with crying and tears. She makes herself cry everyday (actual emotional tears, not by cutting onions) and records videos of herself crying. She also likes watching videos of other people crying (both male and female) and likes to read articles (both fictional and scientific) about crying and tears. Is this normal? Apart from this, she is a very normal person and isn't even overly emotional (she cries at things that usually make people cry and that's it), and hasn't shown signs of any kinds of mental health issues. She is kind, friendly and intelligent, and it seems like the only thing weird about her is that she has this strange obsession with crying and tears. Is there an explanation for this? Will this be harmful for her in the long run? It doesn't seem to affect her productivity at university or at work, neither does it seem to affect her mood negatively (I've known her for a few years and until she shared this with me last week, I had no clue she had such an obsession with tears). But I'm wondering if it will somehow affect her physically or mentally to be so obsessed with tears and crying. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.",13Jan2020,1
17,"I posted this in r/depression to no response. I’m really hoping to get some input because I don’t want to go to a therapist if I’m going to waste their time.

I was looking for therapists online, and I'm getting hung up on one question that seems like it'll be asked in the consultation: ""What do you hope to gain from therapy?"" Because the answer is nothing. Or, I have no fucking idea. I'm cosmically pissed that I'm stuck in my shitty, flawed body, and that I'll likely never be able to date a woman I'm attracted to. And I frankly have no interest in being happy on any other terms. I don't want to find fulfillment in anything else. I don't want to feel comfortable with my life as it is. In my brain, that's tantamount to giving up, and if I'm giving up I might as well just fucking kill myself. And the only reason I want to go to a therapist is because I *do* want to kill myself, so I’m clearly out of my fucking mind.

But I feel like someone with my dumbass mindset would have nothing to gain from therapy. Therapists can’t bend reality, which is really the only avenue through which I even want to be happy.

Not to mention, I don’t know that I could bear honestly spelling out my thoughts and feelings in front of another human being. They’re severely fucking embarrassing and I don’t want to subject myself or anyone else to that process if it’s not going to be productive.",13Jan2020,1

I called the suicide hotline and have been followed up with like 3 times and every time they tell me I need to go to a mental health screening to see a counselor right away. I didn’t want to feel pressured into it so I talked about the situation with my dad.
My dad is also depressed and suicidal. We’ve had a rift in our relationship for the past few months because I keep coming to him in crisis and he doesn’t know how to help. He’s now angry with me and is telling me I beat him up emotionally by bringing all of my problems to him. He’s right, but I’m in so much pain lately I don’t know who to talk to when all I want to do is talk. When I asked for his opinion on the mental health screening, he told me if I wanted to do something like that I should’ve done it months ago, and that if I do it now and I’m held I’ll lose my job and won’t be able to afford my apartment I’m moving into this week. 
He told me moving away was a mistake, that I’m going to barricade myself in my apartment alone and make my situation worse. I apologized profusely for putting him in this position and told him I don’t want to hold him emotionally hostage, but I just don’t know who to talk to anymore. I told him I want to get better but he just seems skeptical. I feel like such an utter failure. 
He kept telling me nothing matters, and that he wants to blow his brains out. He tells me he fucked up and failed me as a parent. I love him so much and I don’t know how to preserve his mental health while taking care of mine.",13Jan2020,1

Ive always had a hair pulling problem. When I 
was really young I had a somewhat bald spot on my head because I would always pull my hair. Lately though, it has just gotten really bad.

I know that it's a bad thing to do, but I can't seem to stop myself. I bought myself tweezers and whenever I'm lying in bed I pluck my back hairs. I also pluck out my nose hairs. I don't have to because they look fine, but I still do. There is no hair left there.

My roommate recently bought new superglue and I put it on my leg to let it dry then peeled it off. It hurt like he'll and I don't know why I did it but I've done it four times and just finished the bottle. It wasn't a big one, but still.

This part is kinda nfsw, so just skip it if you don't want to read it. I have a full bush, but I put on superglue there anyway so I could pull it off. It hurt like he'll and halfway through I really regretted doing it but then tonight I did it once again.

I don't know what to do about this. I told my parents because no matter how old you get, you can always rely on them, but they told me that I've always had a hair pulling problem and that it was fine. I haven't said everything to them though, because it's too embarrassing.

I don't know if I could go to a therapist becuase I feel so embarrassed about this. Thoughts?

Hello, recently I have lost pretty much all of my interest in eating, the only time I want to eat is with friends, or a girlfriend, unfortunately, I don't have either one, and I am not sure when things will change.

It's because of this that I don't eat that often anymore, unless I truly need it.

My question is this: Since I don't want to eat, can I survive off of protein shakes? It sounds strange, but I need calories, except eating alone makes me feel guilty

There is not a problem with my social skills, there has always been an external reason for me not having a social life, I know this for a fact, for example: I am currently in a college where no one has time for anything due to the fact that it is a cheap place, and most of the people there are middle aged adults trying to get their life together. 

I used to eat alone all the time due to other external problems, but the guilt drags me down when I eat alone, and I don't enjoy eating with my family either, for example: we had pizza today and it was too hard to even take a bite, and this problem is only getting worse.

On psych meds, particularly SSRIs, I sleep for 15-20 hours a day and maintain zero focus when I'm awake. Tried all kinds of meds, different categories of meds, at the lowest possible doses. Absolutely no relief. It was starting to wear down on my mental health more than it was helping, since I had to take semesters off from school in a row and started having to work from home. I'm not even on meds for chronic migraines because I was prescribed something that was primarily an antipsychotic and I couldn't handle it.

I eventually had genetic testing done in March that showed that there is not a single SSRI, narcotic, beta blocker, or antipsychotic that I can metabolize at prescribable doses. I was then removed from all of my meds and haven't been on psych meds since.

I still struggle with anxiety on bad weeks. I don't get anxiety attacks, but during stressful times, my anxiety gets in the way of making decisions. I'm wondering if a psychiatrist would be able to prescribe or reccomend an off-label PRN that isn't primarily a psych med if I refuse to take a daily medication?

38,"I just was so emotional and I wanted to text her and she told me her sisters mom died and I told her that I was so sorry for her loss and then she said she didn't want to talk about it and asked what I wanted to talk about and me being a fucking idiot decided that was a good time to tell her I loved her and she got mad that I said that right after she told me her sisters mom died and I didn't mean like that I swear I just thought she wanted to change the subject like she said and I thought maybe it would take her mind off it and it just kinda came out. I thought maybe letting her know I cared and loved her and thought she was beautiful and kind and caring would help I know she's going through a lot but she won't tell me anything I just want to see her happy but she won't let me help or even care about me loving and caring about her. She was mas because it was a terrible time to say I loved her, and it really was and I told her how sorry I was and that I didnt mean it like that and it just kinda slipped out because I thought if I waited any longer she wouldn't care or maybe even forget about me. I asked her to forgive me and she said she did and then said goodnight but I feel like she was lying just to get me to stop talking. Why am I this fucking stupid how the hell did I think that was a good time? I mean I asked if she was ok and she said yes so I thought she wasn't like actively breaking down over it or something. Yeah but even then it was such a stupid fucking move. Hopefully she'll be willing to discuss it later. I still have a little bit of hope.


I'm so sorry if this is worded terribly, I am just so flustered and in shock that I did something that fucking stupid and I'm scared she won't like or care about me anymore. I really am sorry I didn't mean for it to come out like that. I am just really bad at wording things and like I said I thought that if I waited any longer she would forget about me.",13Jan2020,1

43,"I’ve had depression all my life and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder when I was thirteen (though I’m not sure it’s an accurate diagnosis tbh). A few years back I experienced one of the worst depressive episodes of my life for several months. After being severely depressed for a while, I became irrationally paranoid and would constantly throw myself into panic attacks by convincing myself that I had a bomb in my brain or that the government inserted a chip in my brain in order to read all my thoughts or that I had terminal cancer, etc. I kind of ran to the Army in order to distract myself from those thoughts because I knew if they pursued I’d end up committing suicide, and it worked well enough to keep me alive.
So, I just got out of the Army a couple months ago and I’ve basically become a housewife (my husband and I are trying to have a baby, though now I’m not sure if it’s the best idea; I’ve had a history of miscarriage so we thought it’d be best if I took a break from working while pregnant). Because I stay at home so much, or do leisurely activities that don’t require all my focus and attention, I pretty much have all the time in the world to let my brain wander as much as it wants. I’ve been depressed for about a month and a half now mostly due to miscarrying this past Thanksgiving. At times I’ve felt suicidal, and it’s been getting worse lately. I noticed a week or two ago that I’ve started dissociating often. Sometimes I convince myself that nothing and nobody in my life is real. This past week I’ve become very afraid of eating meat because I’ve convinced myself that the negative energies trapped in it from the animal’s death is going to try to kill me (and so now I overcook all the meat I have so as to kill off any chances of becoming fatally sick from it). I have a very clingy cat that meows incessantly when she wants to be pet and today I told my husband that I get worried that she’s not really meowing for attention and that she’s trying to tell me something important. I told him that I get worried our cat is trying to tell me that the world is about to end. 
Right now these little delusions that I have are harmless compared to the ones I had before, but I’m worried that they’ll just get worse with time. It’s also concerning to me that I apparently need a constant distraction or else I’ll immediately sink into this world of depression and paranoia. I was awake all night a couple nights ago because I couldn’t stop thinking about killing myself. I know it’s past the point of concern.
I was wondering though if there are any psychology experts here who could maybe tell me if these irrational fears are symptoms of any mental illnesses? And if so, which ones? I was thinking maybe depression with general anxiety, but there’s so much about psychology that I don’t know.
I do plan on going back to therapy and getting a help from a professional, just for the record.",13Jan2020,1
44,"Hello, lately I have been struggling with an overall feeling that if I stop worrying about something, something bad will happen.  My wife and I have been experiencing a challenging pregnancy and at one point were told that are baby might be have a moderate to severe deformity (thankfully this does not appear to be the case).  Also, what I believe is being triggered by my ocd is the fear that my wife will tire of me and no longer want to be with me or that she is still hung up on an ex.  She has done nothing to contribute to any of these fears, and in fact, she is nothing short of wonderful and showers me with love and affection.  It's kind of hard to describe, like I'm not worried when I'm worrying, but I worrydiagnosed with an illness or if I stop worrying about our relationship.

Factors that I think contribute to this are that two of my more serious relationships before meeting my wife involved me worrying less about my partner's feelings towards me and then later finding out there had been varying levels of infidelity or dishonesty, especially in regards to having residual feelings for a former partner.  Also, I have noticed my ocd, anxiety, and depression increase with traumatic events.  I am a first responder and have recently dealt with the murder of three children as well as responding to the suicide of a coworker/work friend without knowing who it was who killed themselves until I walked in the house and saw him dead on the floor.

I am not treating anything here as a diagnosis and am currently seeking/receiving help, but I would like some insights and some information, if possible, that could allow me to do some research.

47,"I personally struggle with anxiety and depression on and off. This week I've slowly started isolating myself, gorging on food, procrastinating, and distracting myself with Netflix and video games. I've been trying to snap out of it and pull myself together, and in doing so I realized something fascinating about mental health - ITS LIKE RIDING A HORSE!

OK now, I know it sounds wierd, but hear me out as I explain my analogy. 

1. A GREAT RIDE 
When we are in a healthy state of mind, we are in the passenger seat, grasping tightly at the reigns and gently guiding the horse in the path we wish to follow (aka goals/tasks). We are not beating it with a whip (inner critic) as it leads to a very frightened and agitaded horse. No, we lead it and encourage (self compassion) the horse gently, calm it during a difficult trek, and provide encouragement. You have control of your horse and you take good care of it. 

2. THE SLIPPING POINT
This stage is what I like to call the slipping point. During this stage, one starts to loosen the reigns and get distracted or lazy. If this is done for long enough, the horse will lose direction and start wandering off. This is what happens when we ignore taking care of our mental health. You will eventually begin to slip from the saddle into the next stage.

3. THE FALL
Sometimes, you don't realize how bad it's gotten until you fall off the horse. You hit the ground, and not only that, your boot is caught in the saddle! So now you are dragged by a wild, neglected horse, as it scrambles round and round in a panic or slumps down in defeat. This breaking point looks different for everyone. Some may not even notice that they've been dragged by the horse due to extreme disassociation and wake up one day wondering why the hell they've been feeling so terribly.

MAIN TAKEAWAY- the point of this analogy, is that mental health is something to be take care of ON A REGULAR BASIS, like a horse. If done well and consistently, you will manage your mental illness and proceed more smoothly in life. But the key is to be AWARE of when you're slipping and slowly starting to lose your grip. Readjust your hand, and get back on that damn horse.",13Jan2020,1

But many times a day, I feel like I have this sort of ""devil/angel"" in my head.

So has anyone got this really weird tick that just triggers the absolute fuck out of them? To me it’s people, things or whatever that is close to me.

I use to have suicidal depression for about 4-5 years of my life and worked my way through that, found confidence all that. Through the sadness now I just find rage like little things can just set me off and I am a whole different person. It’s like I’m not even there. 

I have a real problem with letting myself be vulnerable to other people. With feeling cared for and loved, I subconsciously stuff all my emotions down because that’s how I coped as a child. Anyone of authority use to scare me damn near to tears when they talked to me.

70,"It's been a while since I've posted and I feel as if I have lived several lifetimes in that space. I ended up having to put my care on hold for a while because of some physical health things that I needed to take care of. I needed a two day procedure (out patient surgery) but the months leading up to the date were hell, and I've been recovering for almost a month now. 

**TLDR: I'm still batshit, cutting to get by, I now have RAGE burning due to new trauma, and I can't seem to get help and I just need to get by, one day at a time**

I feel like that kind of ""sick"" gave my mind  something else to focus on, but only for a little while. It was something very emotional as well, which hasn't helped. I've gotten through it, but I am definitely no where near over it. I was doing ""okay"" until a week ago, when I couldn't sleep for over four days, I had had maybe 5 hours total via short naps but every time I fell asleep it would be less than three hours before I bolted upright in bed, or a night terror would wake me. 

The procedure was definitely triggering. I dream of the gas stuff they give you, breathe in four seconds, out six seconds, in four seconds, out six seconds. I was crying so much the nurse had to keep the count the entire 30 minutes and it's seared into my mind. I often have nightmares of this. 

After days and day of little to no sleep I got extra loopy. The WWIII speculation started and I dove into head first. I was making non-stop commentary, grew more social media followers than I'd ever had - I thought the the world needed me. My grandiosity and mania skyrocketed. I live in Canada, and kept saying and thinking that Russia and China want this war. They want the USA to send their armies out in masses to leave North America unattended, or not well guarded so they could invade. No one could prove me wrong. I made so many speculative commentaries and when one thing after another kept coming true I got worse and worse. 

It took DAYS and a trip to the emergency room to get me a little straighter. I began (and still do) to obsessed over killing one of our neighbours. She's a horrible person, and I know I've never spoken to her, but I'm SURE of this fact. She has a dog that she walks off-leash and it gets into physical fights with other dogs, and hers isn't usually the stronger one. The poor thing. She leaves it's poop everywhere. I'm also pretty sure she's not human. Wether she's an alien or a demon I'm not quite sure yet. 

I collect knives and things, but anyone with a good kitchen knife could get the job done. The urges were so bad I cracked open a razor and went to town on my arms and legs instead. It helped. I tried to keep it low, only every 30-45 mins to keep that rush of the feel good chemicals steady and to get myself to morning. I had told myself that I would tell my mother and husband that I NEED emergency. We go, my mother drops us off because she doesn't want to pay for parking. I know...but at least these days she's somewhat trying. 

For anyone who hasn't read my past posts, we're living with my mother currently because I lost my really high paying job ($80k/year - yeah talk about going from everything to nothing) due to my current mental state. They've been letting me float by, and with the physical medical stuff that took precedent my MH stuff was on hold.

Back to it - we went in, did the typical stuff, got triaged etc, got in almost right away because saying you want to kill a neighbour, and having a plan, a very specific and concrete plan you get seen right away. The head nurse was amazing, I brought all my past medications, papers, etc along with the pages I have of my delusions, hallucinations, urges, and thoughts &amp; feelings. At this point in life I've gotten tired of this dance every time with new doctors. I'm tired, I am sick and tired of having to prove I'm crazy. It's what I feel like happens every time. I'm just so tired of it and most of the time, I don't want to get better, I'm fine. Everyone just needs to leave me to be who I'm going to be. 

I finally saw the psychiatrist, and he was TERRIBLE. And arrogant piece of shit, and after giving me some drop in therapy places to go to let me go. My husband was in pieces. He has fuelled a new rage and desire in me. I want to go down and bring him with me. I want him to be known as the own who had a killer in his hospital and he let her go. Immediately I'm thinking I need to find ways to commit mass murder. How do I poison water supplies, what can i spay onto vegetables at grocery stores, or inject into fruits/veg. I even wondered...how does one get things like anthrax? and I mean the real deal, not a bag of ""white powder"" I got scammed for on the dark web. 

I want to hire a PI to get me everything that they can on him. I want to know when his children are born so I can send them things on their birthdays. I'm obsessive and when it comes to my MH when people don't take me seriously I feel the URGE to PROVE. THEM. WRONG. He is my number one target now. I have been holding myself back for over a decade now, and now I don't want to. He even tried to toy around with me, and the minute I sensed that the mask went on, and I began my plans. 

I had brought my bowie knife to the hospital. Not even my husband knew, no one checked my little backpack. It contained three stuffed animals, and my knife. It's a Hibben, it's VERY NICE. I could have jabbed it so far into his arrogant cocky body over and over, but then it would be over. There is no way I'm going down with a body count of 1. I know I sound like the worst edge lord right now, but they're just trying to be like us. They wish they could stab into flesh, feel it tear open then the relief with the warm blood spraying up, and pooling up around your hands. Warmth, a warm that the demons never let me have anymore. Funny because you would think the army of the damned would bring warmth with them, you know hell supposing to be on fire and all. But they're cold, so cold. 

My family is super disappointed, and they don't know how to manage me. They're stopped sleeping in shifts. I've held myself together long enough to get myself to the point where I can now no longer sleep and be awake unsupervised and I'm ready to start making the world hurt the way I hurt. To start correcting some of the injustices in this world. I want to bring chaos. I want governments to burn. I want to set the world on fire, eat the rich then walk away to leave the common people to RISE UP and finally take back what is ours. I don't want the world, I don't want to take it over. I have no idea how to run a better functioning society, but I do want to help open the playing field for people to do better, because I know they exist.

They say they'll get me new help, try a new hospital, but it's been a week and I'm still home and I'm tired of fighting for myself. I'm just tired. I'm scared to sleep but managed 7 hours since Jan 10th. I'm keeping track in a digital note because I feel like it'll be important. 

I seem to always write novels here, but it helps. What brought me here tonight was trying to google how to stab myself. I don't want to die tonight, but I want to leave a series of escalating incidents to really nail this psychiatrist to the post when he is eventually sued by the families of the people I've killed. There aren't any good answers, everyone just telling the OP's to get help, to call 9-1-1, saying it's that serious. In reality aren't I fine? I sat down and wrote ALL THIS. Does that seem like something someone who isn't fine would do? I am speaking rationally, I have my thoughts together. People who are in a crisis can't make plans. I am okay. Am I sick? Yes, I know that, but I can't seem to get help for the life of me. So I need to do this my way.

75,"Recently I went through a break up. This isn't the problem actually. It was rough but I have gotten through it more or less.

But the problem is that it made me realize just how dissatisfied I am. I am just not happy. I am not sad either. Not angry, nothing. I am just drifting through each day. Get up, shower, travel, waste my time all day because school is not engaging me at all. I just go there, collect my As gotten purely from natural gifts and waste my day on Reddit. When I get home I have to wait for hours for anything to happen. My friends get back, it's time to go to training or it's FNM/ commander night at my local games store. I am always just waiting for short and transitory bursts of any emotion. 

I have nothing to strive for. My place in uni is basically ensured, my parents have enough money so I don't need to work until I move out. I do but just because I want some extra cash to waste on things to distract myself from reality. I don't really have anything to live for or look forward to either. My girlfriend made me happy but now that she's gone I realize that even before that I was running on memes and video games all day. Video games and magic the gathering are the only things that really bring any emotion to me at this point and my ability to play them is relegated to a fucking schedule until my friends get online or go to FNM. I live for human interaction and intimacy but I hardly really get it and I have no outlet for it. I just do the best I can to distract myself and have no idea what to do. 

I don't really lack motivation. When I want something I do it. Problem is I just don't fucking want anything. I don't care for fame, power, money, drugs, whatever. I just want to feel something. I wanna feel love, hate, happiness, sadness. I can settle for anything at this point. On one side the break up was a wake up call to show me just how miserable my life is. On the other side I miss her because U genuinely felt something consistently for once.

She definitely is depressed and self harms, I have of tried to speak to her about the self harming when I noticed cuts on her arms, I felt uncomfortable bringing it up and when I did she made it clear she did not want to speak about it. I had just asked what had happened to her arm and she said 
""it doesn't matter""
 I asked her if she wants to talk about it, said I am here for her but I didn't want to press her further when I could tell how uncomfortable I was making her. 

She also has bad insecurity issues, she thinks she looks disgusting all the time even though she is beautiful. She used to miss our plans purely cos she couldn't face going outside because of her face, she is a lot more comfortable around me now and will see me even not wearing makeup but I can tell it is a real struggle for her. She is obsessed with her appearance but never thinks she looks good and this really takes up a lot of her mental space at times, constantly thinking she is disgusting and missing important things such as college because she can't get out of bed. 

I honestly have no idea how to approach this, she isn't registered to a doctor's and won't get that sorted so she can't even go to get help yet.

88,"As the title says.. i’m only fucking up more and more and don’t know how to get better
I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for about 2 years now, and It’s only getting worse, especially as of lately.
I’ll try to keep it short as there’s pretty much no way to sum everything up in a reddit post.
When I was young I had a great relationship with my father, seen him as my hero and all that. Our family was doing great financially and all was fine. My father was almost always away with “business”, and he was also away for a few months at a time now and then, but I don’t remember this as I was little and probably didn’t pay attention because I was used to it. At this pont my father was “living in another country, working”. We used to talk on the phone and everything seemed normal, but then again I wasn’t paying much attention. That was until I was about 12 or so. I went on to find out he was actually in prison and those times he was away for “business”, yeah, he was doing illegal stuff, hence why our family was doing well with money. But that stopped around the same time as well. This time he was in for 3 years, 3 years which were vital for me growing up, as I was entering the “teenage” phase of my life and definitely needed a father figure. These 3 years changed everything. I went on to see who he actually was and we kind of fell apart in my head but on the outside I was pretending not to be mad at him for some reason. The money was now gone, and my mother was working 2 jobs to be able to provide for me and my sister, who was about 3 at the time. Her second job was cleaning offices for various companies and I couldn’t leave her alone on this so at about 13 I think, I started going with her, waking up at 5:30 and going to clean offices before, and sometimes, after school. Time went by and he got out and came home. On his first day home he made me cry. I don’t recall the reason, but I remember crying and wishing he went back. He started working again, so my mother and I stopped cleaning offices. He tried to “reconcile” with me even though I never told him I was mad at him, but I guess he noticed our relationship was not the same. But this was in vain. He was not the hero anymore, he was just a regular dad whom I wished to be away from as much as possible. Time went by and he went in again, but for a quite short period of time, I can’t remember exactly. When he got out he moved to another country by himself to work and support us financially (as our country is a shithole). I was around 18 at this point and finished high school. He kept trying to convince me that It’s great there and I should go visit him, and if I wanted to I could make some money (legally) myself to buy a car (didn’t have one at the time so it sounded pretty tempting). I didn’t want to, just because it meant spending time with him, which I hated. However, for some reason I once accepted. I went there and met him, and we went to his place to get some rest. The second day I went to work with him (he worked as a driver, and had daily routes to another country nearby). Everything was alright. That was until we returned. We were going home but were stopped at the border for a routine check (he was driving a sprinter and this was back in 2017 when the immigrant crisis in Europe was full on). The authorities said they need to keep him because he had a warrant from another country. It was my second day with him and I was left alone in a country where I had no one (except my brother but he was about 600km away). He told me to wait for him until the morning (as it happened during nighttime), so I could drive back to get him. Of course he didn’t come back. I had no money. Just the sprinter and enough gas to get back to his place. I Called my brother and he came to get me (we get along great). Ended up staying about a month in that country trying to get a job to support my mom and sister since he was gone again, but I couldn’t do it. It was depressing for me. All of that experience in that country was horrible so I went back home (note that I hadn’t spoken to him for about 2 months since it happened because he wasn’t allowed to call). The sprinter was a leasing and, not paying it for 3 months led to the leasing company wanting him to return the vehicle. When we first spoke he was mad at me for not staying there to pay the lease so that he could get back to working when he got out. He told me countless times that now he had to start all over again because of me. Eventually he stopped, got out and started working again in that country for a while, before returning home “to be with us”. Fast forward to this late spring. He was wanted again. Turned himself in and he’s still there as of now. For the first time in my life I told him that I resented him for everything he did and that he fucked me up big time and I’m depressed and have mental issues and he replies by telling me he did a lot for us and that I don’t need Any help because I’m a Champion (he calls me that sometimes because I practiced martial arts for about 6 years and had countless trophies including many national championships under my belt, no pun intended). I Felt relieved but my mental health is getting worse as days pass and I don’t know what to do about it. He fucked me up big time. I never learned how to be a man but he always wanted me to be in his absence, and this is now affecting my 2 Year old relationship with my girlfriend with whom I want to spend the rest of my days with. She’s the most wonderful person I have ever met and has helped me enormously but I still can’t get my shit together. I feel like everything’s falling apart for me. My dreams don’t really matter anymore and I just want to be well for her, but don’t know how. I don’t want to drag her down along with me, she deserves way better. 
I was the bravest and most ambitious person I knew. I was positive, Happy, outgoing, socially active, all of that. Now I don’t know who I am anymore and It’s scary. 
The worst part? He doesn’t understand the impact that all of this shit had on me and doesn’t seem to me he ever will. 

I guess this was more of a venting post.

TL;DR - daddy issues fucked me up big time and i’m a fuck up now",13Jan2020,1
89,"As someone living with anxiety I know I can think the worst in any situation.  Today I'm going for an MRI because I've had a lot of problems with my hands and feet causing pain, getting weak amd straight up being clumsy.  I've done some other tests which have all been normal but today I am spending a boatload of money to rule out MS.  My head is all over the place as part of me thinks that maybe this answers all of my questions about what's going on yet the other part of me screams that I'm wasting money because it must be all in my head.  I hate the process of figuring out what if anything is wrong.  I hate coming to the realization that my head is simply manifesting symptoms.  Does anyone else go through this?  

Everyone says go with your gut when you think something is wrong and keep pushing the doctor but having anxiety sometimes means wasting thousands of dollars to he told it's all in your head.  I hate having anxiety, not that anyone chooses to have it but I wish I could get a better grip on it.  Here's to hoping I get some sort of answers this week.",13Jan2020,1

92,"I always had problems socializing and I've also suffered from bullying for a long time, I felt empty a lot of time and also I cried sometimes for no real reason. I have though of myself as a really paranoid person since a really long time and I had friends but I didn't feel like they were real friends, though I didn't really care about it at that time, there were some special cases where I did wanted to be with that people but I had problems trusting them which I think lead to a conflict that ended in my losing contact with some of them. Two years ago I finally entered high school and started trying to socialize, and it worked, I started making friends, but something was wrong, I still didn't feel like I could trust them, I felt like they were only with me because they though I was miserable and that they talked shit about me when I wasn't there, and I did know it wasn't true, ""but what if it is? 'cause it probably is."" time passed, my bond with my new friends grew stronger and my worries too, 'til this new girl arrived, at the beginning I didn't talk too much to her, and I don't even remember why I did, though probably one of the factors that caused that is because one day I heard her say that my friends told her I was really funny, and that really made me happy. Some time after I was talking with a friend and I don't even remember the topic, but he asked the question, ""have you felt in love with someone?"" and my obvious answer was no, but it made me think, and I finally noticed that I felt in love with that girl, I always put her before everyone else, I spent most of my time with her, and with time my feelings grew stronger, but my worries also did and worse than ever. But with time they started getting lower, I loved all of the time I spent with her and I didn't feel bad or anxious even for a bit when I was with her. With time I really started to believe that she liked me, and I wasn't the only one, some people truly though that we were a couple, but life can't be that good, and I discovered that another guy liked her and she knew, I got really anxious about that and the next weekend I told her that I loved her, it was not reciprocal. I remember how that moment felt so unreal, ""This can't be happening to me, life can't give me something good and then take it away."" I was hanging out with my parents and my stepsister when that happened, and I started trying not to cry so they didn't notice, but my stepsister saw me, and she started to giggle which made me feel worse, when I calmed down a little I made a really shitty excuse for them to bring me home and then leave again, and they obviously didn't believed me, but they leaved me at home. My grandparents also live with us, and they had visitors, I literally couldn't talk without starting to cry anymore, and I wanted to be alone, so I climbed up to the second floor from the yard and entered through the window of my bedroom, to then start crying for hours until I felt asleep, and it was like that for some time, I finally started getting ""over"" it and trying to get rid of my feelings, and it kinda worked for a time, though I still couldn't take it and every now and then a week I exploded and started crying, worse than before, I was happy and then sad and then happy again. Instead of trying to get ride of my feelings I just tried to lower their importance, if that makes any sense, and worked, but now when I cried I didn't had a real reason, it has been a cycle when I feel really good, like I have a bulletproof heart and nothing can hurt me anymore, and then I don't even know how but I start feeling really sad as if nothing really made sense and I did not deserved this, and after finishing crying I feel  like I have a bulletproof heart and nothing can hurt me anymore. Sometimes I feel like doing this, and then that is really stupid, and I should do something else, but that is also really stupid, so I should go back to the first thing. months later, some days ago, some friends came to my house and I had a really good time and we agreed to hang out the next weekend too, and when they leaved, I started feeling sad with no reason, then not that bad and I started to play stardew valley with some friends, though I started to feel way worse until the point that I just couldn't talk anymore and just had to disconnect, and then I felt asleep, next day, I waked up still sad, and played videogames to distract myself and feel a little less sad, worked for a pair of hours, started crying later. Had enough, got out of my bedroom and sit in the couch 'cause my parents just arrived and wanted to watch a movie, then we were going to eat, I reached the point were I wanted to leave really bad, and thankfully my grandparents asked them if they could help them to move some things, I went to my bedroom to start crying again for no reason. I heard a sound coming from my phone, I calmed down and looked at it, the girl I loved just messaged me when I most needed it, and I started to smile, then I noticed that I still love her and I just can't forget about her, and I hate myself for that, I would had thrown the phone if it wasn't so noisy because I don't want anyone to notice, then punching a journal that I had where I wrote how I felt until I noticed that I started bleeding, and then I tore it to pieces. I've reached the point where I started to love crying each night, I love feeling miserable and that people talk shit about me, I love that she rejected me and thinking it was deserved, though I have no idea why and I hate it. I started to think that maybe I should seek help and really needed to vent, so I just messaged a friend telling him just this and then cried until falling asleep, I waked up but didn't feel like crying, I just felt empty and lonely, I regretted really hard messaging him that, ""nobody I know should have that information and I'm not gonna seek for help"" I tried to delete the message and I noticed I couldn't, but it wasn't such a big deal, he has been my friend for a really long time, and we know a lot about each other and he is probably the person that I most trust but I don't know him in real life, so he really can't do anything with that information. I told him that I was exaggerating. I felt happy again and then cried that night, and then here I am writing this at 5:30 AM. He saw the message some minutes ago and I started to get really anxious since he hasn't responded, I know he will, I know he cares a lot, we are best friends and our conversations are always really friendly and kind, but I still feel anxious. I'm tired of this shit, I don't want to feel that way anymore, at least at this moment and hopefully my opinion doesn't change again like it did when I tore away my journal, I don't know what to do or what mental illness I have if I even have one, I'm not even sure what was the point of this post, though at least I know that I feel released after writing this and that I'm too stubborn now to do some real damage to myself outside of some accidental cuts or try suicide, though I once tried to.

I'm 29 years old, I've lived in Phoenix, AZ most of my life but I have travelled and lived in other states and ever other countries [Korea, Norway]. Today's technology is... Depressing. And it's not that I don't like the direction technology is moving [sort of], it's more that I have this strange phenomenon where shit literally craps out on me or starts doing shit that I didn't tell it to do on a near constant basis. It's almost daily at this point that some electronic device in my life doesn't fucking work the way it's supposed, even if it's brand new. And I'm not technologically illiterate; my girlfriend has grown tired of my bitching and anger about it that she's started monitoring me like a prison guard to make sure I'm not an idiot with modern  technology like cell phones or video game consoles or computers and whatever else a modern young person would have in their home. She's confirmed I'm doing everything correctly yet witnessed MANY times that it just simply malfunctions with no real reason behind it. But the second SHE tries to do the same thing as me, whatever device is being used, works perfectly fine the second it leaves my fucking hands. Several weeks ago she finally admitted this kind of this does happen to me at an unusually high frequency...

Here's an example [and a quite recent one] Before she moved in with me she had this security camera with a phone app that worked amazingly well. She installed it at my place when she moved in with me and I downloaded the app so we both have access to it, and within several months it just completely stopped working altogether. The manufacturer has diagnosed it themselves and straight up told us they honestly have no idea why it stopped working, there's no damage to it at all in any way and they've had ZERO other incidents like this.

This has been happening to me for almost ten years now, it even effected me with some military equipment when I was in the Army in my early twenties. I don't know what the fuck is going but it's becoming extremely difficult for me to live in a world so heavily dependent on modern technology but every time I get MY hands on it, it craps out on me.

Last incident was last night and now I think it's starting to impact my relationship... I guess my girlfriend was just trying to make me feel better before because last night she told me that this happens to everyone and I just have an extremely low tolerance for it... I've NEVER met a single person who has this happen to them with such severe consistency that it makes daily life a goddamn struggle because you literally cannot survive in the modern world today without technology...

I don't buy cheap shit either, I have expensive taste and I take care of the things I buy...

I don't understand what's going on. There's no where I can go where I can get away from it all and have a normal daily life, the world literally forces you to adapt or... Well there is no other option. I don't know how much more of this I can take...",13Jan2020,1

Campaign crap....like pretending theyre good people and care when they know they have fucked you over. And heres the fucking kicker.....they want you to talk and open up, TO THEM, so they can automatically judge you in a negative way and later use that information against you.

You cant even talk you your loved ones about whats going....because when you bring up dark, negative shit in your head.....you can see it hurts them, and that just piles up the guilt....and other times they get upset and angry

Have you tried talking to a professional? You feel like a fucking dickhead when I do, As you're talking theres a voice like ""stop being a fucking baby"" ""fucking softy"" ""fucking get over it and move on"" so you feel like more of a loser and dont want to talk, also this guy gets paid to pretend to care. Just another fake person in the world.

I think after a while of this, you come to the conclusion there is absolutely nobody you can talk to....you are alone with your issues that only yourself can somehow pull off a miracle.....to fix.....but at some point...maybe its just too late....its irresiversible damage...

Hey all! It seems most of you guys here know that the mental health scene and stigma is still very strong and discriminating in our modern society and it goes to show how hard someone with a mental health condition like depression, anxiety, bipolar, personality disorder etc. has to go through just to find help or even just someone to talk to about their feelings.

I've had enough of the discrimination and marginalisation towards people with mental health conditions and hence, what I've been working on the past few months is creating a closed non-profit telegram support group for you guys of all backgrounds to come together to support one another, as well as advice each other when one is going through a tough time.

We are about 200 members strong as of today.

The group is a caring, close-knit, non-judgemental and well managed community filled with people being able to freely express themselves in a safe space and share any sorts of problems or issues that is currently affecting them.

Remember you are never alone in the fight against mental health and if you wish to join this closed telegram group please do so with the link below or search huddlehumans in the telegram app.

I would go to my appointments, vent, cry, do the work/ homework requested of me, etc., but after every session I felt ridiculous. I felt this way, primarily because I know that there are people in the world WAY worse off than myself (I'm kind of able to keep a job as an RN, I have full custody of my son, I'm not an addict, etc.).

110,"So I'm kind of new to this therapy thing. 

I met with a therapist for almost 9 months last year. It was mainly about postpartum depression and anxiety that I had after my daughter but we also went through a LOT of other stuff. Working on how not to ruminate and obsess, discussing my self esteem, working through issues with my own mom, doing a TON of therapy related to trauma related to the birth and how I felt in those times, etc. 

I look back and it really did wonders for my mental health. Toward the end I was thinking ""Why am I even going to this, I feel great"". Life, for a while, was SO GOOD for a solid few months. Seriously, I was so happy and was leaving work every day excited, happy, just on cloud nine, could not wait to get home to see my family. 

Well now about 5 months after discontinuing therapy with her it is like I have fallen back into old habits once again. All of the coping skills we talked about are not working. I am now ruminating and obsessing over an entirely new subject. Life is still good but it is affected a lot because of this obsession. I feel almost like I have let myself down and I am kind of embarrassed to call this therapist up again. Is she gonna be like ""Wow, did we not just solve all of this stuff last year? Why are you back?"" 

Has anyone been BACK to a therapist again for a similar issue? Is this common? Sorry if this sounds a bit off the wall, I just don't know how this all works as this is my first experience with therapy.",13Jan2020,1

113,"I'm 23 and living abroad from my mum (53) as I'm completing a doctorate. While my mum's suffered from depression before, she'd never suffered from psychosis (apart from a brief isolated episode triggered by corticosteroid medication) until about this time last year when my partner and I visited for Christmas. She became extremely paranoid and suffered from delusions and auditory hallucinations, with most of her paranoid delusions being fixated upon the police, an ex-boyfriend of her's, and an ex-friend who had slept with him (neither of whom she's seen or spoken to in years). At first these were fairly 'typical' delusions (secret cameras and monitoring devices in the house, them breaking in and stealing from her, etc.)  but they rapidly escalated. 

Eventually, she had delusions about things which weren't specifically to do with them, and one night she locked herself in the bathroom in the middle of the night and called the police, claiming that my partner had killed her/our dog and that he had a knife and was trying to kill her. My partner woke up between the phone call and the arrival of the police to see her crawling around on the landing muttering 'no please don't say that, he's a good DM' (we'd been talking about playing dnd not long before). After that, the police arrived w tasers and arrested my partner, but let him go upon seeing that the dog was fine and my mum was clearly suffering from a psychotic episode. She was brought to hospital and they released her the following morning. 

We had to leave and go back home the next day, and I tried to speak to various mental health professionals to get more help for her, but because they were putting it down to physical health issues (she has suspected lupus) they just kind of brushed it off as not their problem. The issues continued, and I received calls from her where she insisted that the people around me were imposters and I wasn't safe. I spoke to multiple professionals and told them what was going on, and they assured me they were looking into her case, but they couldn't tell me anything because of confidentiality. 

Not long later, my mum killed our dog because she believed there was something evil in him. This came as a complete and utter shock to me. She'd never displayed violent tendencies, and even in her worst of health, that dog was everything to her. She realised not long afterwards what she'd done and reached out to the crisis team and told them. Still, nothing was done even though I tried to urge mental health professionals that she clearly needed some form of help. 

Since then, she's had sporadic psychotic episodes, although nowhere near as severe. I can usually tell when it's bad because on top of beliefs about her ex-boyfriend and ex-friend conspiring against her (she has a current fixation on something called 'V2K', or 'voice to skull' technology - it's conspiracy theory mind control stuff), she'll struggle to follow a conversation or retain information, and it's difficult to follow her train of thought. While she can acknowledge that during the events that led up to my dog's death she was suffering from psychosis, she puts it down to her poor physical health at the time and refuses to acknowledge that she's had continued issues since then. 

Yesterday I received a call from a psychiatrist letting me know my mum had been arrested on harassment allegations from her neighbours. This rang true, as I know my mum believes they're conspiring with her ex-friend. He let me know he didn't think she was well, and recommended temporarily detaining her to assess her before a longer sectioning. I'm her only immediate living relative other than a brother she's not close with, so it had to be entirely my decision. I agreed. 

Today, I received a phone call from her where she's being held and she questioned me on whether I let them do this. I said I had, and she was furious with me and has said she'll be starving herself to death. She kept insisting that her neighbours were conspiring with her ex-friend, and was frustrated that I thought she needed to be sectioned. Even though she still has this belief, she seemed lucid. Despite everything, hearing her on the other side of the phone trying to reason with me has made me question whether I'm doing the right thing. Even though cognitively I know I am, and reading this whole thing back makes it clear, it feels like I'm doing something incredibly wrong. All the reassurance in the world from my partner and friends isn't helping, because it's not their parent. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: my mum, who I live away from, started suffering with episodes of psychosis a year ago, with delusions that her ex-boyfriend, ex-friend, and neighbours are conspiring against her. The other day she was arrested for harassing her neighbours and a psychiatrist called me asking for my approval on sectioning her. I agreed, and she's furious with me. I feel like I'm doing something wrong, and I don't know how I can make myself feel like this is the right thing to do.",13Jan2020,1

123,"I dont have anyone to talk to about my mental health really. 

Not anyone trust worthy at least.

My mother has abused me horrifically and i despise her existence. My father is a strict snob who doesnt respect anyone but himself and never did anything to help me. My friends wont talk about mental problems and actively avoid conversations about them and i as my paranoid self feel awkward and scared of expressing how i feel to them.

The worst part is i do actually have a therapist. And shes helped quite a bit with realising i was abused and how terribly i treat myself. But shes also really into alternative medicine wich prevents her from even considering medication for my depression and shes incredibly homophobic and sexist.

For context i am, in fact, a barely 18 years old butch lesbian.

So talking to her isnt really the most comforting thing, it has caused me quite a bit of stress actually due to her honestly quite idiotic and offensive opinions. (she once compared gay couples adopting children to cloning. no, i dont get it either)

The thought of switching to another therapist, while appealing, stresses me quite a bit as well.

What if it is a bad idea while im working for my final exams? What do i tell my father when he questions why i want to switch? Will he ever take me to another? Will i have to be the one to tell her? How will she react? Will she be angry? What if the next therapist is worse?

I realise that most of the above are at least unreasonable but knowing that doesnt change the fact that they feel like real, plausible outcomes to me. As if they are inevitable, i struggle to avoid them, abbsolutely terrified of everything.

Terrified is a great word to describe myself. Alongside angry and sad and tired, so extremely tired.

Sometimes i just want to go find a place where im alone and scream.

Sometimes i just wanna be able to lay in bed and do nothing at all and just rest.

But i cant do that because i constantly have to do something, anything, as unproductive as that is, i just need to be constantly busy or the guilt kicks in.

Sometimes im guilty for existing, for causing any kind of disturbance to other people.

Im scared of being in environments i dont know, with people i dont know, the mind numbing feeling that they are judging me completely overcoming my thoughts, paralyzing me into constant terror.

Sometimes i get really panicked and  i cant breath properly and my heart pounds, my hands shake, my eyes water, my stomach and head hurt.

Loud noises panick me. Things moving sharply towards me panick me.

And sometimes everything feels dull and uninteresting.

As if ive fallen into a deep pit of tar, everything slow and dark and muddy and lifeless.

I dont really want to live most of the times.

I dont want to die, i have never really been suicidal i think, i just dont feel like existing.

I wish time would stop so i could pick myself up, get ready for all that is to come because its moving too fast now and im getting left behind. 

Thats how i feel at least.

Completely lost and hopeless.

I have trouble with studying because it is a big part of my trauma (for the entirety of my childhood my parents used my grades as a way to measure my worth as a human being). I dont want to succeed because i dont want my parents to be pleased by me. And i think i want to get into university. I say i do. But i dont really feel like it. Dont really care that much. Id much rather divert my passion towards my fine arts exams, my country's fine arts universtity being a much more appealing option. But its astoudingly difficult to get in (about 90-130 people pass each year) so i ''need'' to first get into a normal university through the national exams to have one ensured. 

Do i sound like a brat?

I think i could have actually liked school once to be honest.

Outside of school history, philosophy, chemistry and literature are actually things i find appealing.

But in the context of studying for exams they become dull and uninteresting to the point of tears.

And i just think that once i actually were a happy cheerfull child, full of life and wonder and confidence.

And it was sucked out of me.

It started when my father had to relocate midway during my high school, as I joined school late that year I pretty much lagged behind in every thing which was a first for me. Fast forward to my final exam and i was pretty much helpless since I could not understand anything no matter how hard i tried. To make things even more terrible, my beloved uncle who was like a father to me, passed away after a long battle with cancer back in my home country. I somehow managed to get by in my exams and my father was persistent on me joining engineering, something which I knew I didn't want or like. Nonetheless i had to join it anyway. 

This is when I got back with my highschool sweetheart, things were going great until they weren't. In a few months the relationship turned toxic and culminated in her cheating on me and eventually leaving, right around the same time my family shifted back to our hometown as well because my father was not doing well financially. I wanted to vent and grief but i had no time to do that because I was busy trying to help my brother who was being bullied at school and supporting my parents in whichever way i could. Things back at college sucked too as my roommate became a full blown junkie and i had to relocate. And this might seem like a fucking joke but in the next one year after that I had an accident, a surgery and slipped discs on my back. My dean at college called my father to his office and insulted him in front of me because we were late with the fees. That broke me bad.

My body doesn't agree with me.

My body looks 12.

At the age of 24, I am still 4'7, 85 lbs, just like I have been for the last 10 years. I can usually only wear children's clothes (Girls size 12) and discovered in a shoe-replacement trip this past Friday that either my feet are one size smaller (size 1 instead of 2) or everyone changed conventions.

My body will not allow internal masturbation or sex because of what I think is a case of vaginismus (which makes your vaginal walls seize and form an inpenetrable wall instead of relaxing and expanding). Pleasure can only be derived from outside. If I want to have sex, I will need to pay to convince my body that it's an adult.

I am so small that people have been commenting on it or mistaking me for a young child in almost every social situation for the last 10 years. I've been given children's menus, cups, and discounts at restaurants even when I've tried to dress like an adult to avoid being mistaken for a child. People have been concerned for me when I'm at work, thinking my employer, whoever it may be, is sleazy enough to employ a 12-year-old despite the law clearly stating that's illegal.

I didn't fully connect the dots on this until after the fire, when I had to throw every adult dress and shirt I owned away because of smoke damage, leaving me with children's clothing, some of which is 10 years old. When I had to throw it away, I felt like I was throwing away my identity as an adult. Even when I was trying on actual adult clothing at Khol's (because you cant attend an interview in a T-shirt) I couldn't help but think I looked like a little girl trying to dress up like a teacher for career day.

I don't know what to do anymore. It feels so disgusting and discouraging to try SO hard to be an adult just to be mistaken and infantilized.

Please share any advice you may have for dealing with this. Even if it's technically advice for trans people, please share.",13Jan2020,1
131,"Having been out of work for 3 weeks, unable to get work and having an increasingly difficult time reaching someone from the unemployment office, to get help, its like the anxiety is getting much, much worse. What really hurts is, working so hard throughout the year, it is so very difficult to get the help. I have never asked for help in such a way, the state is so unorganized its disgusting. This also effects my ability to get proper help, seeing a therapist. Id have to rely on state-funded insurance assistance to see a therapist, which I have been through, and it got me nowhere.   


I dont know how people in a similar situation deal. After going through depression and all that years back, I thought I finally strengthened up. Im really not looking forward to being homeless. $350 in bills, and I can't find a damn thing for work, for the first time in years.",13Jan2020,1
132,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this. I'd say about... 6 or 7 months ago, my mom started having mild visual hallucinations. They came in spurts, so I foolishly didn't think much of it. I started the process of getting her health insurance. Maybe 5 months ago she had a really bad episode involving visual and auditory hallucinations. I acted like a moron and told her I didn't want to have to 51-50 her. From that point on, she didn't trust me.A fter that episode, I didn't hear from the family about anything else (I don't live at home anymore). Evidently, the hallucinations kept going on and my dad and younger sister just didn't tell me about it. 

Yesterday, it hit a head and my mom started calling family members while I was at work. She told them some nasty things that my dad said and they were ready to come out to our house and ""solve"" the problem.

My dad took her to an emergency room last night because she also hasn't been eating or sleeping well, been dizzy, and has fainted a couple times wherein she's hit her head or scraped her knees and elbows. My dad said he told the doctor about all that and mentioned the hallucinations, but the doctor only responded to the physical, not mental. They did some preliminary blood work and a CAT scan on her head and chest (she's been saying her ribs hurt), but they apparently came back fine. 

The nurses have started another round of blood tests and fed her breakfast. They're going to be coming back for more tests at 11am and apparently the doctor will be coming around as well. I'm going to try and flag him down when he does show back up and let him know about these hallucinations. I'm just not sure what to do here. I'm afraid, so I can't even imagine how my mom or dad or sister feel. I just want her to return to normal but the more I interact with her and the more research I do... I just don't think that's possible. She's not even that old, only in her mid 50s. What the hell could be happening? 

If the doctor won't admit her, theres a Crisis hotline that services my area. They come out with a clinician and police officer and do a face to face assessment of the situation. If the clinician deems her unfit or whatnot, they'll take her involuntarily. So I guess I know what the next step is, I just wish I knew beyond that. I'm not even really sure why I'm posting this. Just... yeah I don't know.",13Jan2020,1

135,"I'm 15, first time I felt this was when I was 13, but it has been getting a bit more regular. I would probably say once every two weeks or so. It's really weird to describe it, the first way to describe it is I feel like everything I do is fake, I haven't talked to another person while this is going on, but I remember once I was watching a YouTube video and the guy in it, his reactions and comments seemed fake. It's hard to describe it, but that's the first set of emotions I feel. The second would be almost a sort of panic, but not really. It's almost a kind of bounciness. And the final, third, one would be heart racing, but the weird part is that it doesn't actually race, but it feels like it is. From what I've read online, other symptoms are sweating, disorientation, tunnel vision and a few others which I haven't had.

136,"My mother is pretty Toxic. She stuck with me throughout me being in hospital. But I could probably attribute half my problems tp her and her attitude towards life. She revels in hypocrisy - the sort of person to say that the people who support me in my care a bad. But she works in a care home for children herself and literally everytime we speak or see each other she unleashes this bullshit on how the kids are awful. This hits hard. I was in care for a time and the environment wasn't all too great. I also acted very badly and made wrong decisions. Though the way my mother talks about the kids in her care sounds like abuse. She tells me how she will say ""oh boohoo"" etc etc when they lash out. I believe even without being there that this is just fuel for the fire. Treat a person like an animal and they will act like so. I myself have had problems with a previous neighbor about my mental health; completely unprovoked my neighbor would call me a ""retard"" for whatever reason. My mother noted that as the neighbor worked in care how awful her service users must feel. She must have forgotten that line of thought as she told me yesterday ""I'm allowed to not care on my days off"". I told her calmly it's binary in my eyes. Either you're there for the kids. Or you're there for a paycheck. The latter should disqualify you from care imo - go work in a supermarket.

Also my mother has a new boyfriend about half her age that is about 3 years older than me (I'm 20, he's like 23 and she's about 48). Now I won't say anything more than that the guy is a tool. He has a bad temperament and makes stupid and childish decisions. Also he seems to come along every time my mother visits and he's a pain in the balls. I have noted that evertime I see them I feel significantly more low and angry for some time after.

This decision to cut contact would be much easier if she didn't owe me a bill. I have a PIP payment every month. one portion I get for mobility which is quite a bit. Yesterday she told me she owes 700 pounds and that increases by maybe 150 each month. I need to find a way to charge her so I can leave. I actually have a motability car but she told me she would keep it to use (as I can't drive) and she would pay me the equivalent of the payment I'd get.

138,"I've just started a new job, one month in. I feel like I've really settled in quick and I get on with everyone in my team. I have no anxiety around going to work, I quite happily get up each morning and drive there. There is nothing I dread about this new job, but every night I get terrible nightmares about members of my team hating me, humiliating me, shouting at me - so I wake up in cold sweats.

I'm a former sufferer of Generlised Anxiety Disorder. I was diagnosed with it in 2016 and it lasted about a year and a half. I felt like I was all clear of it by 2018, and my therapist agreed. Day to day, I have no anxiety symptons, it's just these strange nightmares.

139,"I was dating a guy for a year. The relationship was stressful. He was always weird and shy but he opened up.

 Things were ok but sometimes he could be randomly snappy when I asked a question or had a doubt about something. He started to be distant and opened up about issues he had with his family which made him distressed. He would often take his frustrations out on me. And later apologise. 

Sometimes when he would take his frustrations it would be delusional accusations. Making claims that I’m trying to marry him when I wanted to break up. Which I was confused about. He stopped talking to me once and was angry everyday and mean. I didn’t understand why. He didn’t see me for 2 months. He later admitted that he saw me speaking to a guy at a party and he didn’t like it and that was why. 

When we started officially dating he was hesitant to commit he asked me many times if I was sure. First he made excuses then he said he hears voices and acts mad sometimes and asked if i was sure. I didn’t take him seriously because I thought he was exaggerating about him being depressed. Or using it as an excuse. 

During the relationship he would put me down daily. It seemed he resented me and would get angry easily. I didn’t understand. It was irrational behaviour. So I left him. The last time I saw him he shouted in public that he can get any girl he wants. He said he never wanted to be with me. 

Another time I saw him he shouted to me that “I know what I did” I was confused I asked him what did I do. He couldn’t say but was angry. This was in public too. His best friend calmed him down and asked why he resented me and what I did. But he couldn’t say. He then made up false situations and it seems that he really believes it happened. He also claims he’s famous. I explained that he wasn’t. But he insisted that he was famous and people come up to him in the street. When I didn’t agree he was upset and passive aggressive. 

This all happened over the last year. I still love him. But I’ve blocked him since September. After he shouted at me in public and was aggressive. I’m worried that something might be wrong mentally but I’m not sure. When he calms down he says sorry and says he misses me and says he doesn’t know why he gets paranoid and angry. I know his sister has severe mental health issues. It’s in his family.  

I’m just confused about everything. I know he hasn’t got much friends. And he’s not close to his family. I’m just worried something might be wrong.",13Jan2020,1

Was I wrong to completely cut this girl out of my life? Should I cut my parents out too? What do I do if she keeps trying to contact me on fake accounts?


So, for my Xmas gift my parents booked me and my “best friend” a trip to DC. We’ve been on and off friends since 2011. We are both 18. They booked the Train and hostel. And we just came back yesterday. Parents don’t really like my friend (she made fake hate accounts about me years ago and secretly video recorded my entire family calling them white trash) but they didn’t want me to go with my boyfriend and they told me to pretty much babysit her before we went.

We Took a 17 hour train ride to DC from Chicago and stayed for 8 days. 

On the train - She wanted me to sleep in observation car so she could lay out in our seats. Gave me an attitude when I came back to seats. Got pissy because she brought too much luggage and had me pay for her extra suitcase. 
Kept going up and down aisles while others were sleeping. Inconsiderate and didn’t care. Kept bitching about no service and how she’s bored. I didn’t want to say anything because she’s argumentative as fuck. I was already annoyed on the train. She also kept calling me names and loudly announced how I need to stop sharting my pants and that I smell like an onion patch (neither are true she’s just being an obnoxious jerk).

We finally got to DC. 
She brought her speaker and She starts blasting explicit dirty rap music and porn complete with smacking noises and kept banging the headboard off the wall. You could hear the music from the elevator. When I told her to turn it down she told me to F off. She also opened the window and blasted the music and was looking for reactions from people on the streets. She also mooned people from the window and lifted up her bra and yelled t!tties in a man voice.  

I believe my friend also wiped her a** and smeared feces on the walls in the communal bathroom because it wasn’t there before she went in there (several times) Of course she denied it but that’s something she would do (she did gross things in the school bathroom before) Somebody also took a literal dump on the shower floor itself and there was poopy toilet paper in all the sinks. She was laughing. Absolutely disgusting. 

She kept talking in Australian accent through the hostel hallways and elevators and was yelling fck me baby, oh aching clitoris where are you, cum in my pu**y, I got the strap on waiting in the room and just all these disgusting sexual things and thought it was hilarious. It was embarrassing. It was also at like 1 or 2am.

She also kept calling me a dumba** and just saying all this hateful stuff really loudly and I told her it’s rude and hurtful and she laughs and says she’s just joking and I said I’m starting to wonder. (I believe she thinks self deprecating is hilarious)

She also made us walk to Arlington in the middle of the night from dc. It was freezing cold and it hurt my lungs to breathe and she said “I don’t fkn care about you I’m gonna keep walking bye ya fkn loser” I was irritated.  

I had to keep paying for ubers the entire time when the metro was closed because she refused and I couldn’t leave her because if I don’t see her again my parents would’ve flipped. 

When she gets angry she will walk away and not answer her phone exactly why my parents told me to watch her and why I couldn’t say anything to her. 

She also made us stop at the pentagon when on the metro (to look at the memorial) at 10:30pm and I felt extremely uncomfortable. 

On day we were suppose to come home - She wouldn’t let me see the train tickets (physical copy) and kept talking about how she didn’t want to go back home before it was time to board. She told me the train left at 7:30pm (it left at 4:05pm) she didn’t get back until 6 and goes oh shit the train left and started laughing. My parents were furious that we missed the train and pretty much wasted their money.  My boyfriend paid for greyhound tickets back and my friend was saying how her mom would drive to dc and pick her up and told me to go myself. My boyfriend and parents bought her a ticket and my parents told me so help me if your friend doesn’t come back with you and I had to practically beg her to come back with me on the greyhound. 

Throughout the trip She kept yelling at me to leave her alone  and to stop watching her every move. We were at a restaurant and she moved tables and I was video calling my boyfriend and I look over and she left the entire restaurant. I started crying and panicking to my boyfriend and he said that my friend is an ahole and he felt really bad for me. I told him I couldn’t wait until the trip was over. My dad called and I explained what happened and he yelled at me to go look for her. Long story short she was outside the metro station a few streets down talking to someone and badmouthing me to them. She saw me and was like “oh look the annoying fk decided to get off the phone with her middle eastern fkboy and followed me” I told her that is ignorant and she doesn’t even know him (they never met) and she said and I don’t want to know him he’s a controlling ahole (wtf?) 

We were at the air and space smithsonian and she left without me knowing and wouldn’t answer her phone. I got yelled at for not watching her and I better find her. Or police would get involved. I was crying at that point. 

She also got extremely angry that we left the hotel at like 2-3pm some days (because we were out all night) and she said we didn’t come to dc to sit in a hotel room all day. She was limping around dc because she hurt her leg (too much walking) and was still wanting to go on more forest marches. 

My parents got a $170 cleaning fee because she trashed the hotel room and they are making me pay it back because she’s my friend (but I didn’t trash the room). I also have to pay back for the greyhound tickets. 

This was my Christmas gift and I had a miserable time but my friend loved it and she’s now asking when we are going on another trip again. I left her on read. She has some nerve. I’ve been getting yelled at all weekend and scolded and she’s gotten nothing from her parents (probably because all they gave her was spending money and my parents paid for everything else).

TL;DR - my friend made our trip literal hell, she is extremely immature and I’m getting backlash from my family evenhough they booked the trip for us knowing how she is and there is so much that went wrong that I can’t write in a tldr so please read and give advice thank you.

144,"Completely self diagnosing here but I think I’m [22F] struggling with seasonal affective disorder. I live in a country that has very wet, cold, dark and miserable winters. I never really got used to them, especially compared the the winters I experienced in my childhood, which had a lot more sunlight, lovely fluffy snow and more of a dry cold rather than damp cold. 


I was diagnosed with depression as a teenager, I was self harming and very suicidal. I was never diagnosed with anxiety but honestly I wasn’t quite sure how to articulate how I was feeling and I know now that feeling that way isn’t normal and I now recognize some of the symptoms as anxiety.  This wasn’t seasonal, although the symptoms did worsen in the winter. I remember one time I had been clean from self harm for an extended period of time, but relapsed after being out in awful awful weather, I just felt so miserable and angry. 


Recently I’ve been having very passively suicidal thoughts. Just things like “I would actually be kind of happy if I died now just because I don’t think the rest of my life will be at all meaningful”.  I’ve also realized that on the weekends, when I don’t have to get up for work, I’ve been staying in bed as late as 2 or 3 ... after a reasonably decent night of sleep. I am starting to go to sleep later too now. I would be completely socially isolated if it wasn’t for my boyfriend, and I notice myself getting extremely agitated with him recently. 

I feel like a different person in the summer. I love just wandering around town exploring, sitting with a book, doing anything brings me joy it seems. 

I’d like to stress my symptoms now are not anywhere as severe as when I was a teen and I have no desire to self harm. But I think I do have SAD. 

I just want to know if this sounds similar to anyone with SAD and that if it does, have you found light therapy at all helpful? Seems like a load of nonsense to me but then again I’m not in the best humour these days.",13Jan2020,1
145,"Throwaway for obvious reasons, but I’ve been dealing with this for almost a decade now and just need some help. I know that posting this won’t solve anything, but I’m hoping to at least maybe have a better understanding of what went wrong and how to get this individual some help.

I will attempt to be brief in my summary of what happened and put what I feel are potential symptoms or issues related  to the overall problem in point-form to make this information more readable.

Just under a decade ago my former spouse and I started having problems.  It was out of nowhere but coincided with the birth of our second child and the beginning of my spouse’s use of social media (specifically Facebook). She would become irrationally hateful towards me and distant and whenever I attempted to talk to her about it, she would either be hostile or completely ignore me.  This went on for a few years and then I eventually learned (by complete accident) that she had cheated on me when our youngest was only 3 years old.  I was devastated and could not picture a world where I was only going to see my children every other week at most.  

We tried to fix things after this, but my former spouse showed little to no desire to truly fix things. My offers of marriage counseling were rebuked, and nothing really changed. The ignoring and distancing and general irrational hatred towards me remained. 

She eventually told me she was leaving and taking my children to live at her parents (an hour and a half away), but my children did not want to go with her. So, we remained (and continue) living in the same home.  I have been sleeping on a couch for about two years now and every day is an absolute struggle mentally and emotionally for me.  I have done a lot of thinking about and observing of my former spouses’ behavior over this time and retrospectively.  The strange thing is, it has really brought about in me an interest in psychology. 

My summary above is very mild and doesn’t truly present the scope of the mental abuse I have been through. And at end of the day I still do not know what happened and if it was my fault. I have never been given a reason or an answer. It was literally as if someone flicked a switch and my former spouse became a completely different person.

I am going to list my observations of habits, actions, and just general thoughts below and I really hope someone can help me understand what happened and what kind of help (if any) my former spouse could get, because at the end of the day she is still the mother of my children and I want to be comfortable with them being with her and want her to be happy:

· First and foremost, she became a Facebook addict.  She often spends double-digit hours per day on her phone.

· Quit her job after our second child was born even before returning to work. She told me she would start looking for a new job in the spring, as I did not feel I could be the sole breadwinner in the family…that was eight years ago. It has been a major financial struggle, but I have done my best.

· When she cheated, she did so with someone she met once in real life, who was also in a long-term relationship.  This did not matter to her.

· Sent nude and pornographic images of herself to this individual after only days of knowing him.

· To this day she continues to send every new guy that shows any passing interest in her, nudes and pornographic images, almost immediately.  If I had to estimate, she has likely sent multiple hundreds (possibly a thousand). She believes that these men can be trusted and would never share or post these images.  I very much disagree and am afraid of what will happen if friends of our children or family members ever see these images in the future.  This occurs multiple times per week, every week. Sometimes multiple times per day. Actually, the last time was just hours ago.

· Once, while I was washing dishes, she made a slapping sound against the wall with her hand and shouted to our children that I had hit her. This above all other things made me realize something was very wrong with her. It only happened once and I know my children did not believe her, but even after all these years, this still scares me. 

· She tends to gravitate to the youngest members of her extended family when it comes to texting and chatting.  She always wants to chat with the teens in her family even though she is 40.

· Spends a great deal of time watching daytime talk shows and reality shows, and little else.

· One especially weird habit is the making of mouth sounds or humming/singing and dancing when she thinks she has been cocky towards me or seemingly wants to appear “tough”. This one really confounds me.  She will also do this whenever I enter a room she is currently occupying.

· Does not take ownership and or responsibility for any of her failures.  It’s always someone else’s fault.

· Her emotions have always tended to be extreme or exaggerated – she will be the loudest crier at a funeral and the loudest to laugh at any joke.  It’s almost as if she does not have these emotions and is trying to mimic them.

· Was coddled by her family her whole life, even as an adult. They are afraid to call her out on anything or talk to her about some of the awful things she has done, and they have always been afraid to give her bad news. They do not at all support what she has done to me and our family, but they do not call her on it at all either.  They are good people, but almost seem afraid of her.

· She would by definition be considered a pathological liar.

· She constantly talks back to the TV and has very forced and exaggerated laughter when she considers something humorous on TV.  It’s as if she wants us to hear her laughing.

· Another very weird one – her steps and actions are very loud.  She does not walk, she stomps.  She doesn’t close a cabinet door, she slams it shut, she doesn’t push a light switch up, she slams it up.

· All of her opinions and thoughts seem to be a regurgitation of what she hears someone else say or reads on social media, but claims them as her own.

· Has become very short tempered with our children over the years.  But I would not consider her to be a bad mother.

· Has occasional times where she asks very kind towards me, as if we are friends and nothing wrong has ever happened. This can last days or even a week. But things always return to the way they were.

· Seems very into her looks now and whenever there is a new man paying attention to her she starts working out briefly.

· Her friends help her sneak around.  She will tell our children she is staying the weekend at her friend’s house to help them with something, but is actually off with one of her men in a motel.

· Is obsessed with her immediate and extended family and hometown.  If anyone mentions someone who has done something well, her family or someone in her hometown has (or could) do it better.

· When she sees parents of our children’s schoolmates, she acts like she is best friends with them, even though she rarely interacts with them outside of school functions.

· There is a constant need to be the center of attention, especially when around friends or family.  Always needs to be part of every story.

· Was not popular in school.

· Society would likely consider her to be of average looks and just below average intelligence.  I do not say this to be rude.

· Loves to watch horrific news. If there is breaking new about some tragedy, she will be glued to the TV. 

I could go on and on, but I suspect no one really wants to read much more of this. I’m just hoping someone can tell me what, if any, disorder this could be. And what could cause someone to become like this, seemingly overnight.  

I apologize for any spelling or grammar errors.  As I want to write this and post it quickly before I decide against it.  As you can imaging, my life is a living hell and I exist solely to care for my children and try to ensure they have a good life and are well taken care of, despite our situation. 

The amount of people that know fully about my situation are in the single digits because I do not want to burden others. I just want to know that I didn’t cause this and that I am not imagining things, and that I’m not really the one with the disorder. 

I have zero desire to ever get back together with my ex, but I do want her to get help and have a better and more meaningful life, for her and for our children.

153,"Hello,

I am a mainly stay at home/work from home mother and I struggle constantly with my mental health. It has always been an issue. Before children I mistakenly saw a child psychiatrist but because I was under 23, she took me on. I told her I had been diagnosed with ADD at age 17 but I didn’t follow a treatment plan nor did I take medication and I also told her I wondered if I had bipolar disorder because I was always either very ecstatic or down and engaging in dangerous/impulsive behavior. She prescribed me adderall and Wellbutrin and wrote down I had bipolar and ADD. I didn’t stick with that either but now finally in my 30’s, I am seeing a psychiatrist and on Ritalin. It helps me to get a lot done but I kind of go into autopilot and I’m not much of a person or a warm and loving wife/mother. It also makes my anxiety even worse. All last week I had panic attacks and got only the bare minimum done. My house and life are disorganized messes. I always try to be the best mom I can be and be productive and organized for my kids but I never achieve it consistently. I’ve accepted that it will always be a struggle. I very much dislike the ups and downs though and I struggle with low self esteem as a result of all of this. Going back to last week, a fuse burned out in me. I don’t care about anything. I never used to think “I don’t want to mom today or I don’t feel like doing the kids laundry, what’s the point, what’s the point of anything.” but since last week that is where I am. This morning I woke up early and got the kids to school on time so that’s a small victory for this week but as the phone starts to ring and responsibilities pile up again, I feel incapable, overwhelmed, burnt out and anxious. My husband is a sweet man but he is a very simple blue collar man who is not equipped to even understand how I can feel the way I do so I’m meeting with a counselor this Wednesday even though we can really afford it. I need help. I feel like a mess, kind of pathetic.

Anyway, thanks for “listening”. I don’t really know what I’m looking for in posting this.",13Jan2020,1

He's my roommate and for the last few years he's always told us that he is depressed and we have always tried talking to him but he never wants to open up to us. He always tries to keep it bottled up. Just within the last year he's slightly mentioned to us about him having thoughts of ending his life but it always stops there and they were always just thoughts until recently. 

A couple nights ago found him throwing up alot in his room and he tells me he was trying to over dose and it wasn't the first time. I try talking to him about it but he just kept wanting me to know that theres nothing me or anyone can do. He also kept saying you cant help anyone who doesn't want to be helped. He made me promise not to tell his parents since he doesnt like getting involved with them.

I just dont know what to do for him since he's so insistent on not wanting any help from anyone.",13Jan2020,1

160,"I have social anxiety and light to medium depression, and currently I'm  doing something that my country requires me to do in school, that is trying out working for 2 weeks, and I discovered that I can't do that.

I discovered that not being with my friends in school makes me really really depressed or something similar.
I feel like I need to be with friends at least daily I feel like shit. And because I have my anxiety I have a hard time talking with people I don't know.

And because of what I've been through today and what I've figured will happen when I have to get work, and I don't think I can do that, I think life won't be worth it.

The thing people might think now is ""Don't you have anything that you want to do? Or some hobbies that you could devote yourself to?"".
The answer is: No. I don't have any sort of hobbies, except maybe reading, and I don't think watching YouTube videos is a hobby. I also don't have anything that I want to do, or any goals.

I'm also afraid that when I change school I will lose all my friends as I know that I don't want to irritate or disturb my friends lives, so I don't usually ask my friends to hang out with me. And as I don't ask them to hang out moving to a different school where I don't know most of the people makes me stressed, anxious and a bit depressed.

I don't know when you switch high school, but in 
 country when your 15 to 16 you need to switch school to get a higher education.

Because of everything that I've written I don't think that l will want to live, in the future. I'm ok with living right now, probably in the future I'll probably not.

161," I have been feeling the effects of a long weekend without sleep and partying for about 4 months now. It all started after a weekend in Las Vegas, after we had left our bags and were walking around the strip, I took a hit of a marijuana vape pen (I am a frequent smoker of flower and previous cartridge user) about 10-15 mins later my hearing went haywire; almost like it was echoing, and then I began to feel as if I was falling through the floor. The feeling lasted about 5 mins and had to sit down to try to stay calm, like i stated i don’t think I was overwhelmed being high, bc i love smoking. For the next few days I was having auditory and visual hallucinations and episodes of microsleeps while being awake, it was terrifying. When i came back home i ended up in the ER after not being able to feel my arms and having a microsleep episode on public transport where i thought everyone was going to kill me, sounds funny but was the scariest thing of my life. They ran regular tests and everything seemed to be normal with blood pressure, blood sugar and oxygen saturation. 

 This feeling has been persistent in disorientation and some what of what I would describe as slight dizziness or the feeling after you eat a huge meal and your focus just isnt there, I haven’t felt the same since. Another way i would describe it is if you just shook your head around a ton. Obviously throughout the weekend I was drinking heavily, partaking in Vegas activities as one does, and sleeping a total of maybe 4 hours throughout 4 days. It feels as if my reality has been altered in a sense which sparks mini panic attacks frequently. Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice would help Have tried alot of natural remedies but next I am resorting to having some tests done.",13Jan2020,1
162,"It’s been a year since I tried to end my life. Since then I’ve been on this journey of healing. I had to cut out toxic people I was holding onto which was pretty much all of my friends so I have no friends. I have some friends that are closer to acquaintances that I see once in a blue moon. I’m in my 5th year of college (had to stay another year bc of mental health) so all my former friends graduated and now I just go to my classes and come back to my apartment. I try to get back into my hobbies, like painting, art, knitting, cooking, etc. but it gets boring sometimes so I’ll watch tv but i’ll get bored of that too. I did meet this boy who I thought was perfect but we hang out once in a while and it’s always when I’m reaching out to him and I just don’t want to do that anymore. When I do hang out w my friends pretty much everyone is on their phones or taking selfies which i’m not really into and don’t like using my phone. It just feels like my existence doesn’t really matter. I haven’t had a depressive episode like this in a while bc I had been meditating and working on self improvement to fix my mental issues. It’s not that I’m uncomfortable being alone like most people might be, I have come to terms w it and did need the isolation for deep reflection to heal my traumas. But now it’s been almost over 6 months I’m still feeling so isolated. These hobbies fulfilled me for a while but not anymore. I guess I wished I had some friends or even a partner, I used to think it wasn’t necessary but I realized having friends makes going through times like this a little easier. it’s nice to have someone to laugh at ur jokes or someone to tell a story to or to tell u that everything is gonna be fine or grab a cup of coffee with or take a walk with.

165,"I am currently in my first year of University and to be frank things are shit. Now don’t get me wrong, in terms of actual studying there’s not really an issue... the problem lies in the social aspects.

I have no real friends here, spend most my time in my bedroom and constantly homesick. When I first came I thought I’d make all these new friends.... but when you are already a very shy person making new friends in a matter of weeks in a whole new environment is nowhere near as easy as some people make it out to be. 

Then freshers went by and everyone else appeared to have formed strong friendships... but not me. And if you think making new friends is difficult for a shy person, trying to join other already existent friendship groups is even harder.

I often sit by and jealously watch other people having fun.. and really want to get involved. But can’t. Sometimes people have this odd idea that if your shy then that always means that you prefer to be alone. No! I prefer to be with people, but internal self doubt stops me.

So you keep telling yourself that, ‘oh tomorrow I’m going to do things differently’ ... but when tomorrow comes you just can’t. And the days turn into weeks and the weeks turn into months and before you know it you are lying in bed thinking why the hell am I doing this.

All the people I love are not at university but back home. And I’m now feeling down and as if I have no one to turn to. I know some of you may reply with join a few societies... But for people like myself walking into a room with strangers and joining a club Late on is absolutely terrifying. So it WILL NOT happen.

He’s a bit older so at times he’d make me feel inferior. I don’t have a car and he’d complain about driving to me all the time -which is understandable, but when we split it made me I want to have a car even more. I thought that’s what would have fixed us, like that was the only reason he wouldn’t date me...

Anyways fast forward to now, since Christmas time he’s been texting me occasionally, and asking to be in my life again. I told him I didn’t have time to play around and that I’m trying to focus on making money from my new business launches. Ever since that rejection he’s been posting showing off his money and texting me about how much money he has.

176,"Trigger warning ⚠️ (child abuse) 

I am codependent. That’s the first time I’ve written the words... I’m still not sure what all that entails or what I have to do. I do not have access or help where I live (20 minutes away from any friends or family-I have 2 sisters. 1 older, 1 younger). 

I do not have support from any family or friends. Partly because none of them know I struggle but that’s because none of them care (I feel) 

My mom is the reason for my codependency. My childhood with her was very traumatic. I lost my father at 12 and she spiraled out of control. I feel with everything in me that she is codependent 100%. But that’s for another time. She was never really a “mother” per-say. She abused me (threw me through walls, cut my head open hitting it against a refrigerator, slapping me 27 times while my daughter was in my arms, trying to physically break a door down to the bathroom to get to me to fight me, while my baby was in there with me and much much much more) but she never hit my other sisters or physically abused them. Just me. She never taught  us how to fix our hair, put on makeup, be a “woman”. She never taught us any tools to take into the real world. She never showed any examples of healthy relationships. Our clothes were hand-me-downs and bought by other people while she would spend my dads SS money from when he passed on her hair products and makeup and new outfits. We currently do not talk or have a relationship at all. 

With all that being said I also do not have any friends. I have 2 sisters. One moved away (to get away from my mother) and the other one may also suffer from mental health issues. Not sure if it’s codependency or she is just selfish. We are all hurt and still mourning because we were never offered the proper support or any guidance after my dad passed. Mom and dad had a toxic relationship for 18yrs, so when he died everybody (on my moms side) didn’t really blink. And my dads side distanced themselves with no contact to us kids at all. So me and my sisters were left to fight for ourselves . Literally. I took all the ‘lashes’ when she was drinking (and when she wasn’t or she was drugged up) so they wouldn’t. My older sister left pretty young and then I became a victim of statutory rape. Then got pregnant and I chose to keep my child and raise her. That alone was hard for me. I think it was more of I wanted to show how much better of a mother I could be than mine. I could love my child no matter what. I could help her and be there for her, I could love her and never let harm come to her. 

I finally was able to move out 2yrs after having my child and it was fantastic. But now that we are out (it’s been 5 years) I’m starting to realize more and more about my childhood and things that I didn’t remember that I do now, horrible, awful things. 

This I think has played a factor on my relationships with friends and my husband and other family members maybe. 

I had 1 very best friend that I think was the first person I ever became dependent on. She was there through the abuse with (okay I’m going to stop calling her mom, let’s name her Betty) Betty. I loved her and was basically obsessed with her. Obviously this isn’t her fault but about 2 years ago she told me that my love was too much. It CRUSHED me. I lost her. And still we talk but it will never be the same. Something inside me broke when she said those words.. now anytime I try to make new connections I think of her and “Betty”. How I wasn’t good enough for either of them. How I was too much and I don’t want to put that on anyone else. 

But I’m also hurt and have recently found that I’ve lost my ‘voice’ and have zero idea how to be assertive. When conflicts come up I take everything to heart and become very emotional (everything just hits me like a whirlwind ) and it is so hard for me to ignore those feelings long enough to utter back how I feel or get off my chest what is upsetting me. 

When I was living with “Betty” I was so strong, I took her shit and let it roll off of me. Now that time has slowed and I’ve allowed myself to really see what I went through, it literally shakes my insides... I feel so unpredictable and like a ball of Fire ready to explode. I have this feeling like there are words on the tip of my tongue but I can’t ever get them out. It gets all confused and jumbled and I literally sometimes say things that make absolutely no sense. So I shut down. Is there ANYONE that may understand what I mean and have some insight? I’m not even sure if most of this is relevant or even makes sense to the point I’m trying to make.. I’m just hurt and confused and trying to figure out how to not let Codependency define me. The only parts of myself I recognize are codependent parts.. if it helps I’m a Stay at home mother to a 15month old baby and 8yr old. I have no friends, no family and I’ve recently just recovered from DMER, Postpartum Depression, and panic disorder..... now this... I feel like I’m just utterly failing as a human being .... any words would help at this point...

178,"(M22) I’m pretty sure this is what the end feels like. I’ve never felt so close to ending my life and I’m questioning if I’m going to live to see the end of this month. I’ve never been diagnosed or told a single person what’s wrong with me and it all started when I was 12. Back then I had started having really bad depressive issues and anxiety and some mood issues, I was constantly from high to the next low and then back on a high, bi-polar maybe, I don’t know. I self harmed badly back then as well, mostly cutting but I’d often do stuff like slam the side of my wrist on the side of a table or something, I’d get massive bumps and bruises, 2 fractures and purposely sprained my ankle a few times and I really can’t explain why I did it, I have no idea. 

I’ve tried to think back about what might have caused this and I can’t remember anything from before the point. It’s like my memory starts at 12 years old, it’s kind of fuzzy, and slow fades back in to when I was about 16-17, around grade 11 because I don’t remember grade 10 but from the start of grade 11 and on, I remember most of I think. All I really know from before I was 12 is what my mom has told me. Like I don’t remember anything, and we used to go to Florida and Disney world for 3 weeks every year, you’d think that’s something I might remember a little bit. There’s pictures, it happened, but if it weren’t for the pictures I’d be questioning if it did.

Today, I feel like I’ve reached an all time low with depression, anxiety, what I think might be bi-polar disorder and something new, borderline personality disorder. I hate to say that I think I know what’s wrong with me but I’ve known for the last 2 years that something new has come along. I’m a different person completely, I forget who I used to be, different thoughts etc. I’ve researched for so long and didn’t find anything that seemed to explain me. Then I finally came across BPD and fit me perfectly, I got this wretched feeling in my stomach that made me sick, it literally explained everything so well. 

I’m at the point if I don’t get help, I’m done. I was trying to get into nursing school and that was my last hope keeping me going but I’m so mentally exhausted I’ve flunked out and stopped trying and basically ruined any chance of trying again. I just don’t know how to get help. I can’t barely explain myself anymore than what I have. I have major issues disassociating and when I try and talk about this stuff or think about what the root of my issue is, my brain goes blank in the blink of an eye. Like I’m at an hour now trying to write this because I just keep going in and out of consciousness trying to think of what happened before I was 12 that could have possibly been so bad that has caused me to be whatever the hell I am today. Where do I start with help, literally where? Am I calling my doctors office and telling the receptionist I want an appointment and when she asks for what? What do I say? I’m seriously lost and need someone to navigate me",13Jan2020,1

I've thought about going to a therapist a few times but it feels silly because I'm not always sad. I feel like I'm just trying to get an excuse for being lazy or whatever.

What should I do? This is very vague since I posted this fast at midnight but if you have any questions ask me",13Jan2020,1
180,"I’ve been homeschooled since 9th grade and I’m in 11th now. My mom and step dad both work full time so I’m home alone pretty much all day. I live too far from my friends to walk over and hang out but that’s all I want to do. I feel so great when I’m with my friends and I spent the entire past weekend with them. I come home to just be so dead in my thoughts and there’s nobody here to pull me out. I don’t think I’m depressed by any means. I want to go back to school but have no motivation or courage to do so. I never talk about my feelings with my mom although she’s the best person in my life. I always try to just bottle everything up and I understand that it’s very bad for me like this but I’m scared to talk. Every time my mom noticed something wrong about me she wants to talk and make it better but I push her away and try to be alone. I think she gets mad at me for not talking to her and I really want to but I’m just so scared of the outcome. I should get some help. I just wanted to vent I’m sorry.

All I feel like doing is getting fucked up with people I don’t know in a place I’m not familiar but I don’t want to hurt my mom",13Jan2020,2

183,"I hope this fits here too
I‘m 17 years old and I feel literally stupid. Because of anxiety two years I stopped school. I have a job and a school currently (dual system in Austria) and I feel stupid. I did a school year again and then 1 year later I changed to dual system. Now im some IT guy and I just feel stupid. If I would‘ve gone to an IT School, I would‘ve known everything so much better. I lost so much time. My clssmates will all be done with school next year and going to universities in 2 years then. And I‘m just here doing my work and school shit. I want to go back but I‘d probably have +2 years again and be done at like 21 or 22... I don‘t know what to do. I hate having a job and once a week school where I don‘t learn shit. I lost so much time and I feel so stupid compared to my friends. I am already shaking when I do an IQ test on the internet cause I‘m afraid of being stupid.
I just wish to turn back time and not lose that many years. It‘s all my fault, I know, I stopped school, nobody forced me. It was my decision. But I‘m so unhappy with my education and everything when I look at my friends. I just know that I could‘ve been on their level but I‘m not
I want to go back to school but I‘d be 17 and in class with 15 yo people who probably think I‘m stupid too and I‘d finish school so late compared to my friends...

187,"Hello. I'm 17 (soon 18), non-binary and from Germany. For about two years now, I've been in love with my male best friend. I confessed to him on June 3rd 2018, so about half a year after realizing that I am into boys too and in love with him. He seemed to have kind of figured that this might be the case, and knowing that the situation was highly stressful, I offered him to think about it for some time first (so he'd know how to respond properly). One week later, he rejected me as he is straight. From that day on, my life just got worse and worse, I began feeling utter sadness, either due to feeling lonely or for no apparent reason.
He and I have actually only gotten closer since that day, but it was always difficult for me to be around him without feeling hurt, and it still is. As I also have slight social anxiety too, I went to my school psychologist. After a few sessions, it got much better and I felt that we are done, so did the school psychologist. However, tjese emotions, the love is still there and in the past few days, being on a class trip with him and thus being close to him day and night, I felt all of this much more strongly. I even experienced something like a half breakdown, where a lack of sleep, audiosensory overload and these emotions led to a massive headache as well as short and shallow breath for about 30 minutes. I drowned everything out with music on my headphones. Since the trip, it hasn't improved at all, so far that I cried last night (and even though I often want to, I rarely ever get to actually cry).

I don't know what to do, how to get over these emotions and my love for him. Soon we'll graduate and while it seems like finally getting free from everything, I still want to keep contact with him, which might prove difficult with my emotional state remaining the same.",13Jan2020,1
188,"I used to have a beatiful siamese cat called Yato who was very much into cuddles. He really helped with my mental illness problems.

A while ago he was kicked out of my home by my mom, because she was angry with me and knew i adored Yato. 

Lately my mental health has been decaying and I've begun missing Yato again. It cheered me up to have a little creature meowing and jumping around the house.

Just needed to share.

189,"I feel nothing, pleasure or pain.  People who try to cheer me up just get a fake smile, I feel that my social interactions are algorithms, and people who want to hurt me stop caring.  I don't care about anyone or anything, it's as if he will stop being human.  Maybe they have hurt me so much that I stop feeling or people who try to cheer me up seem to be liars.",13Jan2020,1
190,"I want to fix my mental health but I dont know how. If I google it it just says some generic bullshit, which I guess could normally work but I've fallen way too deep. I've come to the decision that I should just make myself even more delusional the only thing that is stopping me is this tiny spark of hope that maybe there is a way to be normal and happy, I thought it is supposed to help me but it's just bringing me down. 
I'd be better off crazy than stuck like this, in this hopeless fight. How do I stop holding on and let go? I'm getting worse.",13Jan2020,1
191,"Ok Reddit, I need your help a little bit here. So, recently at school I’ve been having a lot of issues. I couldn’t concentrate for long, was easily distracted, made stupid mistakes, and involuntarily spaces out very often. This was annoying and interfering with my schoolwork, so I looked it up. After looking into the symptoms and taking many credited tests, I determined that I probably have ADHD (predominantly inattentive type). As I’ve mentioned, this has been disruptive and annoying, and was hoping it could be cured by medicine. Obviously to get medicine for this, I need a diagnosis. I’m under 18, so my parents still take me to the doctor. I need to talk to them about this, and to get a possible diagnosis, but I can’t find a way to talk to them. I don’t know how exactly to bring it up and to not make it awkward. I’m also worried my parents might not believe me, as they’ve been skeptical of previous issues I’ve brought up to them. Any tips?",13Jan2020,1
192,"My boyfriend and I were really close, he’s the first person I’ve been able to get over my touch issues and general not sharing emotions with. We dated for three months and it’s the first time I’ve been honestly happy and hopeful in so so long. And not all from him of course, that wouldn’t be healthy. But he made me want to take steps to improve myself.

But he dumped me. For mental health reasons. And I really understand that and I want him to get better. Well probably even get back together after this.

However, since he broke up with me Saturday night, I’ve had the worst couple days of my life in so long. I feel stupid and broken. I’m repressing emotions again. I have no one else to talk to about my feelings even though we are still in contact and are friends, I don’t want to make him feel worse by him knowing how much this damaged me.

I’m crying almost every hour and I can’t really think about anything for more than a couple seconds before I’m on the verge of tears again.

How do I get over a break up that’s not really a break up because we’re most likely gonna get back together?",13Jan2020,1
193,"My therapist is putting me in a hospital as I said I was going to commit suicide and other things.

194,"Hi, guys. I’m 18 years old and have been struggling with mental health issues for most of my life. Last year I was diagnosed with OCD, although I’m not sure of how much I should trust this diagnosis, since I don’t really engage in any of the “physical” stuff associated with it, like ritualistic behavior (unless self harm can be put in that category), and I only had 2 sessions with my psychiatrist.

I do have a serious problem with intrusive thoughts, though. Sometimes they’re so bad that I feel like I’m going crazy. The first instance that I can remember of experiencing any symptom of mental illness was when I was 7. I had a pet rabbit and immediately after getting him I started feeling a strong impulse to hurt him, with images of stuff I could to do him popping up everytime I pet him. One day it got so bad I actually purposely drop him, which hurt his mouth. It wasn’t anything serious, but I feel guilty about this to this day. 

I never did anything else to any animal, because this is truly not how I feel about them. I seriously love animals, but thinking of hurting them has been a recurring problem for me. It got better for some time, but now I adopted a kitten and it’s happening again. This is scary, it’s like someone else is putting thoughts in my brain. It makes me seriously doubt my character and feel like a freak. I feel so ashamed of this that I haven’t told anyone but my doctor, not even my therapist. 

I don’t even know what’s the point of putting this here, tbh. Maybe I just want to know if anyone else with OCD has experienced this to feel less like a trash person, although that’s what I am. I would appreciate if anyone had any advice on how to control this too. I’m sure I won’t do anything to my cat btw, just to be clear, but it’s extremely disturbing to have to live with those intrusive thoughts (not only relating to animal cruelty, but a bunch of other things) every minute of every day. I can’t take this anymore.",13Jan2020,1
