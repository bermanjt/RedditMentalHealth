1,"It's funny, most of the time I just long to feel something. Not that I think I feel truly numb or empty, but I feel flat, I guess. And sometimes all I want is to just feel something that's real, something that's strong, something that's certain. Even if it's crying. I long to cry because I welcome anything that will make me feel something. But whenever I do cry, whatever sadness or self-pitying bullshit that I'm feeling is immediately replaced with anger. Anger directed towards myself because I know that I don't deserve to feel sad because I'm just a lazy piece of shit who doesn't confront any of his problems.

3,"Ever since the pandemic hit, my acne has gotten worse and it is now my main insecurity. I have acne prone skin and have always had it since high school. The main cause of my acne is stress and lack of sleep. 

Never ending assignments and running on 2-3 hours of sleep everyday has become a norm for me ever since I started college so I'm not surprised that this ridiculous schedule has got my skin fucked up. I know this and acknowledge this but I really can't do anything about it if I want to get through college. 

The issue for me right now is how my skin problems from college stress completely transcended from bad to undeniably ridiculous  during the pandemic. My classes are fully online. So that means staying at home. I live with my family and extended family. This means I get a whole package of most relatives and absolutely no privacy. 

My acne never really bothered me because having acne is normal and it shouldn't be something that we should feel ashamed of. But being at home for the past 5 fucking months and having people yapping in your ear everyday about how bad your face looks has caused my mental health to decline so bad that it shows on my face. 

I've never been this stressed about my face in my life, I've never been this insecure about my face. I've never felt like the world would see me as a dirty human for having acne until today. 

""You have such smooth skin but look at your face, no one will want you.""

""Do you not wash your face?""

""I get so angry when I look at your face.""

""Why don't you take care of your skin?""

""Does your face look fatter?""

*Stared intensely at my face while I'm doing my assignments* ""omg your face""

My boyfriend has the above two and it‘s really rocky between the two of us. He is sleeping the whole day and really absent in total. We haven‘t seen each other for almost 8 months (with covid) and it‘s killing me. I don‘t know what to do anymore. I try to be as supportive as possible but i‘m drained. I don‘t wanna leave/lose him since i really care about him and still want to experience so much with him but he has completely checked out it seems. He always says he wants to fix it but he doesn‘t have the energy and that he doesn‘t really feel anything anymore. I‘m really worried for him and me. He doesn‘t call me, no facetime, not even an hour of seeing me.
Right now he is looking for a therapist but can‘t find one and he is convinced that with pills it will get better. Which i do also think but he and me both know the deeper problem.
In the last 2 or 3 months i‘ve been really mean to him, not always on purpose, but sometimes i can‘t keep my anger and frustration in. All i want to do is help him and show him that he is worth everything and deserves everything and that there is still so much there is to see and do. Everyday i feel like losing him more and more and i don‘t know what to do eanymore. Everyone is telling me to leave him since it‘s useless but they don‘t know how it is to have those illnesses.

6,"Hello,

  \[19F\] I was diagnosed with MDD several years back.. Up until recently, it's been a typical depression (Low energy, emptiness, overwhelming sadness, etc.) 

  Around January of this year, my mood has been generally lower than before, and it feels like it's getting worse. However, there will be days where I will feel unbelievably euphoric with no cause. I'll get obnoxiously talkative (I'm usually a quiet person,) bursts of energy and motivation, and while normally when trying to focus on something, my mind can't quickly process what's happening. During these euphoric ""episodes,"" I can't focus because I'm processing information too rapidly for me to keep up with. When I come down from the high, I'm entirely drained of energy.

  I don't know if this is related to the last paragraph, but I've also noticed that in the past few months I'll get fixated on random things (Songs, hobbies, animals, people, etc) and OBSESS over it for 2-14 days, suddenly get totally bored of it, and never touch it again. While I'm engrossed in whatever it is, I want to be doing/learning about it 24/7 and it's almost all I can think about. 

  I know that not everyone on this sub is a professional, but maybe someone knows what's going on with me or if it's normal? 

I'm sorry if this post is all nonsense, I tried my best to articulate my thoughts but I'm not always the best at that.

\~ I was prescribed 250mg(Or around there) Wellbutrin daily

\~ I have General+Social Anxiety Disorder

9,"This morning was rough. It’s currently 1:20 am and I cried from like 00:30-1:00. Just crying. Sometimes I wish me and my mom could always get along and not be at each other’s throats. And that she didn’t give out to me for struggling because that affected me pretty badly. I’m really jealous of people who get along with their mom all the time and like to do bonding things with them. I wish we were like that and that I didn’t always fuck things up like the screw up I am. 

I have like no one to talk to about things that bother me because I’m meant to be the funny one and even if I mention I’m struggling people respond with laughing face emojis like they don’t think I’m serious. Times like this that I feel so alone. I’m carrying so much weight, whether that be my friends secrets or my own, my strained relationships or past experiences that have messed me up. I just really want to be okay again. 

I don’t cry much at all but today I just needed to release some built up sadness. I’m in a better place than I was a while ago so I’m grateful and trying to be proud of my progress but when there’s no one to be proud of me it never feels like I did much.

11,"I really need input. Kudos if you have the patience to read! haha

Since early high school, I (24f) haven't felt mentally healthy. I believe I became depressed a bit after my parents got divorced when I was 12. I have always been someone who gets extremely attached to things, and it was really hard for me to accept the changes. (i.e. super sad every year when school would end; would cry when my parents would sell their car; would randomly cry about my grandparents dying although I was only 5 when they passed). I remember being suicidal in high school, secretly binge drinking, &amp; having sex with guys out of self-pity.

My second-year of college, I decided to move out of my parent's house(s) and live on campus. This is the year I remember truly being happy. Since I was working toward a degree, it felt like I was really working for something. I met a lot of friends, still drank a moderate amount, attended a bunch of dance classes, and met a new guy. Things were great.

I graduated college after my third-year, and was pretty down about graduating. I was graduating with a degree in finance, and I was sad I was going to spend years of my life in a boring field. I ended up dating the aforementioned guy for about 2-2.5 years (he was fairly toxic-- cheating, hid me from his family, judgmental, superficial, etc.).... we broke up 2 years ago &amp; it took forever to get over-- I had to take melatonin &amp; several glasses of wine to get to sleep for months. 

&amp;#x200B;

CURRENT DAY (IN A NUTSHELL): It took me 8 months to find a job, and I was pretty down in those months as well. I have been at my current job for 2.5 years (accountant). I am very thankful for my job..it's easy &amp; I make decent money-- I honestly can't complain. I adopted the best dog ever a year ago. I have been with my sweet boyfriend for a year (although the feelings aren't as strong as with the last one) and he is my bestfriend/adventure buddy. I have days where I feel clear, fine, &amp; happy...and then I have days where I am very sad, cloudy, and odd. My emotions shift quickly. I feel unstable-- like life keeps passing me by in a very strange way. I am tired all of the time too and have trouble focusing.  

Things that may be contributing: my dad disowning me multiple times for trivial things in the past few years (currently not speaking), insecure attachment in my relationship (I am overly needy), birth control?, occasional adderall use (it helps my focus and fatigue), low self-confidence, feeling stuck in my career, feeling stuck in where I live (same place forever), drinking 4x a week, not eating the healthiest?, not having a lot of friends, overthinking everything, fear of doctors/therapists, and I also have moderate social anxiety (which makes me fear leaving the world of accounting-- imagine having to actually talk to people!).",01Sep2020,1
12,"So, I’ve experienced brain zaps for over 20 years now. I am almost 100% positive that they first appeared as a withdrawal symptom, from stopping my SSRI cold turkey. Since then, though, I have experienced them intermittently, both when on prescription meds (or withdrawing from) and when I’m not on any meds. There’s little to no research on them but from what I gather, they aren’t dangerous. The only thing that somewhat concerns me is that occasionally they cause possible episodes of psychosis for me. 

This only ever happens when I’m having brain zaps while just drifting off to sleep. It’s really, really hard to explain but somehow I end up seeing two of myself and I’m unable to determine which body is actually my body. So because I don’t know which body is mine, I lose the ability to control myself and I go into this like sleep paralysis. And it’s terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. And during this, I’m imagining myself moving and it’s so realistic that I “forget” about my actual body, laying paralyzed in bed. And then it becomes scary again when I remember that part. This cycle occurs several times, until I can overpower the hallucination enough to will my physical body to open its eyes. 

Is it even possible to be aware of your own psychosis? Or does the fact that I am aware of these episodes automatically reduce it to something less than psychosis??",01Sep2020,1

Recently, and when I say recently I mean like since a week ago, ive been living such a bad experience  that's taking away all of my joy and overall wont let me live a comfortable life, as I had been living. Somewhere about a week ago, I remember a very painful event of my life, which was caused because of me, completely my fault, i hadn't thought of it for so long even though it was such an impactful event. Now I cant clear my mind and just enjoy things, my subconscious only focuses on that thing, all day long im thinking on all the possible outcomes that could have happened if I did everything as I should have, and it just hurts so much that what hapoen can never be fixed, and it keeps haunting me. I just want to live without it, as i had before, if I try to embrace it and try to redeem myself, no matter what, it will always be the same, i just wanted it to not be like that, but there is nothing i can do to change it. Its not like I have ptsd, like i drift away and get flashbacks, it is just stuck in my head, i try thinking on lther things but soon or later (pretty much always very soon) I remember it again and so on. These days have been a complete torture for my mind, not even working, distracting myself will work, everywhere, everytime, when studying, when sleeping, in my dreams, it just cant get away and my desperation is inmesurable. I just wish it somehow fades away, and I can just carry on with my life as I have before, im not going to kill myself, I just need to be free again from this, please, if anyone who reads this has experienced this and overcome it, please help me, thank you for reading all I had to say, wish you the best 🙏...",01Sep2020,1

23,"everyone feels special. everyone feels like they are more aware of this world than the others, that others are just living without ever questioning why they are here. but we all question it.   
but I think that there are some people whose life is just made to be different, chaotic, restless. I don't believe in god, so perhaps is just a consequence of certain behavioural characteristics, coupled with certain contexts. But is there, I have met some, I am one.

  
I'm 22 and I have seen way more shit than I probably should have, but i am OK with that because with everything bad, something good came. I have been fat, anorexic, depressed, happy, alone, loved. I have been everything and the opposite of everything. I have seen my father almost dying in front of me twice. I am helping him to recover from something that kills many people, I had five jobs, I lived in four countries, I had many girls, I had a one year toxic relationship while living together and working at the age of 19, I lived in the poorest and in the richest regions of Europe.  


I have seen more shit than I should have seen and I hate when people belittle this and don't understand my behaviour in certain moments. I hate it but I don't want to be understood because I know that the last thing that people want is other people's problems. But why do we do this?  
I hate when they try to minimize what I have been through . Because saying that I brough my almost dead father to the hospital and waited 5 hours crying outside sounds devastating, but not even half of how devastating it actually is. And losing a friend in a motorbike accident two days after that sounds like a ""bad period"" to some. Being born poor and having to work to pay your studies and living expenses sounds like ""just"" 5 hours a day of working more than my classmates, but who did it knows that is much more than that.  


This can sound arrogant, maybe it is, but I have reached a point in which I no longer fit with most people of my age. It sounds superficial, but all the problems of my friends just look so unimportant to me. Anxiety for exams, No money for a phone, self-image issues, a girl or a boy. What the fuck are those problems. How are they even problems.  


I think that there is a simple reason behind why suicides are higher in richer countries than in Africa. People in Africa have no time to think about this nonsense bullshit because they must fucking survive. Guys in Sweden are being called pussies and thats their worst day of the year.  
I know I am not the only person suffering in this world, that there are many people who are having a more difficult life than me, but why do we try to minimize other people's issues?

25,"Hi guys,

I have a long, long history with mental health issues and treatment. My mother was in and out of mental hospitals all of my childhood with paranoid schizophrenia. The amount of abuse that I encountered, combined with organic mental health issues and being years ahead of my grade level in school, landed me with a child psychiatrist by 7. I don’t know if I’ve ever gone more than 12 months without seeing a mental health professional in 20+ years since then.

As a kid, it was always critical to not disclose too much about our actual situation to teachers, doctors, cops, camp counselors, etc. CPS got involved with my family a couple of times. Right or wrong, I was convinced my little brother and I were better off outside of state systems and institutions. While our home lacked stability and security, we had considerable economic comfort, and I was able to put together my ticket out with scholarships that I wouldn’t have had access to without support for lessons, tutoring, etc.

I’m grown now and I’ve been struggling with my depression and anxiety intensely for about 6 months. Since COVID everything has gone to shit and I don’t believe that the doctors are really capable of helping someone like me. I’ve been playing this stupid game longer than some of my providers have been alive. When I’ve been in genuine crisis, thinking that a provider will be there to provide meaningful assistance has caused more harm than good. I just want them to write the meds I need when I need them and fuck off. I am so tired of having SSRIs shoved down my throat. They don’t help, have never helped, and no matter how many times I tell that to a doctor they are always wanting to give me more.

Part of me doesn’t want to give up on treatment because it means giving up on the idea that this can make me better... but if that’s the truth, that it’s not and never will be beneficial for me, then I feel I should be staying away and that’s that.

Tl;dr How do you keep your optimism about treatment? Have you ever been convinced treatment was useless and changed your mind? Do you have any advice on finding a provider worth seeing?

Thanks, I really look forward to learning anyone’s stories.",01Sep2020,1
26,"Literally the title. Keep in mind that I am not an english native speaker, so writing this is twice harder than my actual work. TL;DR at the end, this is not worth your time anyway.

It's 4.00 AM right now, I have three texts to submit before 6.00 PM. On of these texts is a group work so it won't be difficult, but the thing is I didnt even check what they were talking about on the messenger group and now I realised that they got it all wrong. But It's too late, only stupid people are awake at 4.00 AM on an open day, and they definitely won't change their part because they guy who never answered on the chat disagree with the plan.   
Then the overthinking began. Why am I so condescendant ? We're 7 on the group and we are 2 new writers. They were cool and so friendly when i checked all the discussion and I didnt want to bother 'em at all. But now, our result will suck compared to the other groups. Why didnt I warend them? 

In two words : Social anxiety. ""I have this low self-esteem that makes me hate myself but I still think I'm better than everyone else"". I've been enrolled on this project since september 2019 but I dont feel I'm a part of it yet. So insitead of telling them my thoughts, I'd rather shut up and follow their plans. Now I regret it cause i have to produce something that I dont like at all AND I CANT BREATHE AT ALL. godammit

That's not my lisonly problem. I also have abandonment issues. Dont get it wrong, I have formidable parents, tho I'd like they were cheering me up instead of forcing me to be like ""the other kids"". Since I'm the elder kid (how d'you say the big bro of 3 girls), no one taught me anything about life. Dad is busy at work from 7 to 18, also busy on rapport at home; mum is the kind of ""dont make too many friends, focus on work work work (she isn't rihanna)"", I don't really remember any meaningful conversation with 'em. I even thought that we make babies by kissing when i was 10.  At the same age, I was the ""brilliant kid"", I skipped two classes because i got the perfect marks then i fell like trash. On the same time, I discovered video games, my lack of social skills, and how to make babies. Thanks to the science teacher and my ""friends"" who introduced an innocent guy to porn. 

But my parents never knew anything about it. It came to a point where I skipped class for 2 weeks, I even wasted my school fees one day. I was hit, blamed and other things till i finished high school. I wanted to learn informatic but my grades were too low to get admitted; Dad couldn't pay private universities fees, so I went on a public university. I failed my first year, I tried music but it didnt work well (and parents kinda forced me to give up by not giving me money anymore), so I joined my actual university (management and other things). I only study to pass the year so dad and mum let me play video games, yet all the teachers say I can be THE best. This is where my condescendant self woke up. 

I tried to learn programming, unity, 3D and other graphism, drawings, music, but none of 'em went well. I dont have patience and I suck at creation. I barely can copy when it comes to graphism. I tried some jobs but the university takes sooo much time so I can't really be independant. I'm lucky to have a job by these very though times tho and I'm grateful I can help dad and mum, yet they dont want it because they still consider me as kid. But I dont have to behave like it. Yes, i'm 22 and I'm still living with my parents and 3 sisters. 

Now i dont know what do anymore. University asks us to prepare a project for the 5th year and I dont have any idea of what to do. I suck. at. everything.

But hey, weren't we talking about abandonment issues? In the meanwhile, I asked out only 5 girls. They were all my ""bestfriend"" before that. We used to do everything together, they even realised I'm a better bf than their bf (their bf became their ex as soon as we were close, everytime. I guess I'm a curse), but they eventually chose another guy because I'm not the kind of guy with whomo girls go out with. I've complained a lot about that, but now i do realise I dont care about it anymore. Relationship is way harder than that and I dont wanna argue or talk about it. I just know i have abandonment issues because : 

* the first one cut ties with me and went out with my best friend (that's another whole story)
* the second had sex with a random guy. She appeared 3 years later with 3 babies.
* the third realised I'm not  emotionally stable so she blocked me
* the fourth wasn't interested in relationship at all
* and the fifth was only playing with me because... that's fun, as she said. we never kissed nor had sex. yes, 22 and virgin. 

Right now i have another bestfriend. I'm about to do the same stupid decision again. But thanks to my overthinking, I dont think i'm in love with her. Best part is, she deosn't consider me as her bestfriend nor someone important at all so I can control my stupid ass from asking her out. But hey, I'm about to lose my mind everytime she ignores me. 

I nearly covered everything. Yes I thought about counseling but it costs too much in my country. I'm joking about suicide everyday but I love dad and mum and my sisters too much to inflict them my stupidity. In fact, suicide itself is so stupid. There are many things to discover in this world. Like aliens, space, the asteroïd that will destroy our world, the revolution of bots. If you're thinking about suicide like me, forget about it. Go out and appreciate the aire, guy a chocolate, eat a whole pizza by yourself. Life is too beautiful to lose it at the end, right? 

Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.

TL;DR : I have abandonment issues, I didnt achieve anything by 22, I'm thinking about suicide but suicide is stupid so don't do it, I have work to do but instead I'll write an useless text about my life that no one will read, I coudln't fight my social anxiety so now I have to follow someone's plan which is totally wrong.",01Sep2020,1

At the end of 2018 I moved from very small town Canada (as in, from an island) to Australia for school. It was an international vocational training for youth work which combined academics with actually living in that environment for three beautiful years. It was my miracle and actually yanked me out of the anorexia and depression that had gotten me kicked out of uni a year and a half prior. Needless to say, it was an answer to my nineteen year old prayers.

It was amazing. I made friends from all over the globe who I did life with for that time and got to know so intimately as people. Coffee dates, wonderful chats, trainers that doubled as life mentors, people to pick me up the second I started slipping, etc. I had never experienced connections like that... truly lifelong friends that I still can’t believe God gifted me. 

Cue early March. I was working at a women’s conference and I guess you could say my conference crush stole my heart. We started dating, my first ever boyfriend who ticked every box on the list.

Fast forward to literally the NEXT day. COVID restrictions were put in place and on our one-day-versary we went into lockdown and could only go to each other’s houses. It was nice but it was boring, especially for my first ever dating experience! 

About two weeks into dating we are told we are not allowed to see each other at all because we were in full lockdown. We honoured the rules, of course. But my house was very cold and everyone was much older than me so I felt very isolated, as many others did I’m sure. Classes went from in-person to online over the course of two days. I struggled with the unknown, to say the least.

Literally five days into full lockdown (so three weeks dating) the Canadian government sends a message saying for students to come home. The Australian government told us to get out because the state of the economy was at stake and students without finances would likely not be able to survive. I panicked. 

I couldn’t get home because my island was closed. Yes, closed. No access. I panicked more. 

His mom, who I had met for about three minutes via FaceTime, told me she’d take me in. I do not agree with living with SO’s before marriage (I know, old school) so I panicked at that too. We’d been dating for THREE weeks, how could I move to a random place in Canada with this guy I hardly know this far!?

That week my very best friend went back to Norway without being able to say bye, my other one moved to another part of Australia, and my South African friend also left. Literally 15+ of my closest friends left without notice. We didn’t know we’d never see each other again the last time we saw each other and I still can’t even process that level of pain. 

Anyways, things got very dire very fast and I had about 48 hours to pack up my life, sell everything I owned, and get on a plane with my bf of three weeks and my one suitcase. I was devastated but refused to process anything.

We arrived in Canada 48 hours later. We isolated in a trailer in the driveway for 14 days, in the frigid cold. I have anxiety already and I cannot describe what all these rapid changes did to my mental health. The social anxiety and general anxiety from being in a totally foreign place with ALL new people was crippling. 

I was terrified and dreading life. Two failed degrees for reasons outside of my control... I felt (and still kinda feel) like a failure at life. I feel like a free-loader and an incompetent adult. I left home at seventeen for uni and I’ve just failed everything since. 

About three months in we had planned a trip to my home thinking it would be open by then... Eight days before our flights I got notified that it was cancelled. That was devastating again. I still haven’t seen my family. All I want to do is hug my baby sister. 

My boyfriend has lived here his whole life and settled right back into pre-Australia life (with COVID restrictions, of course.) My lifestyle back home was so different and I’m a busy body, so I struggled massively. I relapsed with my ED and I’m slightly worried I might have to go back on anxiety meds. 

Now I am working 55 hours a week. I still can’t look at photos from Australia and I haven’t cried about any of it yet. I don’t know how to process that feeling of loss, and feel dumb for even feeling at a loss when so many people have lost so much more. 

Sorry if this made no sense but I needed to acknowledge all of these things that have happened.",01Sep2020,1
31,Does anyone just not know how to love? Like I grew up in a family where I never knew what real love is. And no I have attachment issues where if you show any sign of attention to me I’ll get butterflies when I think of them. And they will be all I think of until it fades away....,01Sep2020,1
32,"Hi everyone. I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible but I’m spinning a little bit.

I am in therapy, dealing with pretty severe depression and anxiety. My therapist doesn’t know how bad it is because I’m an idiot, but that’s beside the point.

I’ve reached a point in my depression where I can’t force myself to do the most basics of my job. I lie and fake shit but more often I just accept that I’m shit and make excuses. I used to be good at my job and a really hard worker so I’m being given a LOT of slack, but people are very confused and annoyed. 

Sometimes I’ll try to force myself to do things but I have a full on panic attack. I can’t focus on anything. I’m stupid, forgetful, incompetent even when I am trying. I’m addicted to marijuana somehow, although I’m just as useless and stupid sober anymore anyway. I’m not suicidal but I have passive suicidal thoughts constantly, like a soundtrack in my head. When things go wrong I reassure myself with the reminder that that is an option. It’s not really an option, so it’s hollow comfort, but it’s what I have.  Sometimes the thoughts are so overwhelming and I can’t think about anything else. Every time I have to call someone it takes me like an hour to psych myself up, if I can get away with not doing it I don’t do it. Every time my phone rings it takes me so long to get my heart rate back down to normal. 

My life is a complete mess but the pressure from work is making everything impossible. It’s pretty high stress work with long hours and lots of difficult decision making that I used to be equipped for but no longer am. 

I want to ask for stress leave, but how? Are my problems big enough? Will my employer look down on it? Will it ruin my reputation? I’m slowly ruining my reputation anyway so might be worth it. I’m so lost, anyone have any advice?",01Sep2020,1
33,"Hey guys I recently started have some mental health problems about 2 months ago. I’ve been very anxious, depressed, and disassociate frequently throughout the day.

Is that reasonable or am i just freaking,01Sep2020,1
36,"To start off, I'm a 20 yo female i was diagnosed with stress and depression, took meds for approximately  a month and then i never went back to my doctor because :
1. My mom refuses the idea of me needing mental help.
2.the lack of therapists in my country and me not liking the ones here because I can feel that they don't really care.
I don't know when my mental health issues started (TW) I was sexually assaulted when I was younger ( it was a family member and child on child abuse) i grew up to being threatened by that abuse by my mother saying she'll tell my father whenever i made her mad, as I've grown up I didn't know how to deal with it so I just feel numb about it now, truly i don't know how to deal with it , and as a teen i was touched by men in a sexual way men who were my  principal or people i was supposed to trust, then almost got raped by a bus driver if it wasn't for the actions I've made i don't know where or what was he going to do to me and  what he had planned, and as time went by i seem to be emotionally unstable, having trust and authority issues, building up so much anger, always stressed and always trying to  make people happy, and since last year I've been finding out that my dad is emotionally abusive to both me and my mother and that has caused me to have more stress and more anger towards him, at this point i can't trust myself I'm always doubting my feelings , I don't even know my feelings anymore , am I depressed, angry, numb ? It's all very unclear I have moments of happiness and thankfully I'm not suicidal at all but all of this is slowly getting to me and it's getting harder to deal with, most times i feel like I'm a burden to people and feel unwanted even by the slightest things, if anyone cares about what I'm saying it rattles me and I start shaking and talking faster, i have authority issues and basically have no power to say no to anyone .
I'm sorry this is too long i had to let it out somehow 💕",01Sep2020,1
37,"I was taking my AP course in psychology today when my teachers started talking about kids that killed animals. When I was young kid, I killed four birds and various insects. I will not deny it I didn't feel bad when I did this as a kid. My teacher said that kids that did this as kids could have a type of mental disorder. Got me curious so I kept searching, it told me I could have sociopathic disorder. A lot of the symptoms are very aligned with myself specifically how I tend to shift my personality to get things from other. I may need to get this check but I don't know, I doubt I will ever hurt someone.",01Sep2020,1
38,"Hi. I'm 17 years old female and finally I decided to ask someone what's wrong with me. So basically my school starts in 5 hours (first day, second year). I feel tired but I don't want to sleep, because I know that when I go to sleep I will have to wake up and prepare. I haven't left my house in weeks. I gained weight and I stoped taking care of myself but today I finally washed my hair, brushed my teeth and planned that I will start again to exercise (did it for month in July).

Except this little problem I have more. I was wondering why I have problem with a memory. Like 4 years ago I suddenly started having strong depression episode. I cried a lot and did self-harm but that's different story. I don't know quite well when it had happened, but I'm having problems with concentration, understanding language, like what I am reading, meaning of words, grammar and stuff like that (never had this problems before - I was pretty good in school and learning was easy for me). I have also memory loss, and sometimes I need someone to tell me twice so I can copy that. I've lost ability to estimate, I can't really remember how those years had passed. 

My depression is gone (?) but at the same time I don't feel very well, I waste time on Internet when I want to do something productive. I can't cry anymore. When I compare my condition before - crying, panic attacks, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, histeria and not understanding what is happening to me, sometimes even a hallucinations - to present condition - empty, unconcerned, hopeless, some kind of calmness, neutrality etc. - seems weird. I forgot to mention that sometimes I feel kinda dissociated but not like that disorder, but more like I'm an observer through my eyes.

I'm not crying anymore like I said. I lost that ability long time ago, even when my family member died I didn't. Sometimes I even start laughing when I should be sad. 

Rarely, but sometimes I'm getting a superpower formed as a hope and en energy to create and dream about future

I kinda coped with all of that myself, psychologist only helped with my ""social-persona"" I like to call. I attended to therapy for year and a half, after my self-harm session my parents sent me to psychiatrist and she diagnosed me with anxiety neurosis (I don't really know how, because I had only 2 meetings with her). That's why I was sent to therapy. But anyway, I didn't talked very much about my mental problems. Got medications which helped me with sleep (my sleep was more solid, but I was insomniac so it didn't helped me quite tho).

I have problem with naming my emotions, I don't know what is love, happiness and all that stuff. I have a boyfriend, but I was concerned if I really love him. I always was the person that helped everyone, care about them, expecially when someone needed that help and couldn't ask for it. My empathy and will to help were so strong that I cared more about others than myself. Now I am more careful and less naive.

When I was having a mental breakdown and suicidal thought few moths ago I said to myself that I will be done when I finish helping my boyfriend with his life. I also planned to study geography and become scientist, but I have doubts if I could do that. I'm artist and want to create music, write a book, paint, discover so many things, but I can't find any motivation. Whatever I start I stop and can't finish or I'm very critical to things I create.

I am not good enough as a person. I hate myself and my life. I only feel like myself in those late evenings when I'm numb and overthink everything. Aside from that I'm pretending that nothing is happening and just ""survive to another day"" and go on.

I could talk about other symptoms I have, but there is so much that I don't really remember them and this post is too long. Anyway, if you are here, should I be worried? Can someone tell me what is wrong with me? I don't know what to do and even I don't know if I want to change that..",01Sep2020,1

43,"My birthday is on the 24th. And I’ve always have had a hard time dealing with my birthday. “Passive” Suicidal ideation has been a major issue with my disorder. Where I’m in the gray area of wanting to die. Like I don’t want to die but who would want to live like this yk?!? But that can be universal. Usually people get a chance to see a pre schizophrenic version of themselves. And I never got that, never will. I’ve actually have found peace with that though. Not that I fully accept my diagnosis because I still have bits of doubt and thoughts of “I’m still just faking it” but I realize the universe doesn’t owe me an explanation as to why any of this happened at all. Honestly seeing my schizophrenia as neurodiversty has helped a tremendous amount. Schizophrenia is obviously one of the most stigmatized and demonized disorder to this day. And I can only speak from my experiences since schizophrenia presents so vastly for each individual case. But I’ve made a difference with myself when I think of my brain and neurology as something to be explored and understood and not something that is inherently demonic, broken and in need of fixing. My therapist suggested today I research more into the brain chemistry of someone with schizophrenia since I seem to be stuck on wondering how this came to be in the first place which is a loaded question I repeatedly ask myself. A lot of good progress when it comes to self acceptance. Tho I acknowledge two truths can coexist. Because while I actively work on my acceptance of disorder. I can’t help but feel as If I’m running out of time. I’ve always felt old and I think I attribute that to the schizophrenia it’s aged my mind up way pass numbers. But now I’m turning 18 and I’m forced to realize how behind I am. When I got diagnosed I was 15 and I dropped out to pursue treatment but my doctor who was working with me at the time moved. So I was left to find another treatment center that’d take me. But nobody would take me because of my age then it was my diagnosis. Then it was the fact that i had been experiencing it for more then 3 years. They only took cases that had just started showing signs and I’ve been showing signs since I was 5. I eventually found a therapist I liked and was comfortable with. And I’m still with her But she even knows she can only do so much for someone with schizophrenia. So she referred me to the first treatment center I heard of in my area that focuses on schizophrenia. But they didn’t take me because of my age again. But now I’m turning 18 and I get to reapply. I’m very honest and blunt about the fact that I’m frustrated and tired as it is. And no part of me wants to continue any of this but I will because I was always going to. And there’s no stopping me. I thought of positive rage today and I think I need to implement that more in my life. Yea this sucks and I’m angry and frustrated and tired. But I was lucky enough to come from love. And to be loved. And to BE love. Everything else is just noise along the way. I am
Going to be okay even if I don’t want that lmfao. I am going to find my way I am going to pave my path there’s no running from it. I will make this nowhere my home. And I will write about it till my hands get numb. Because tho the human language of words is limiting in ways beyond thought. I can atleast have a civil conversation with myself on paper to read and reread when I eventually feel that reoccurring loneliness that knows me better than most folks. And tho it’s another form of talking to myself so are dreams. I’m universal baby. And I feel least alone when I remember I am a whole being. YES, my ability of perceiving, thinking, and feeling is different from what you know but again that is UNIVERSAL. I am an experience that will die out might as well try to make peace with it.",01Sep2020,1
44,"Hello everyone! This may be long it may not... I am unsure at this moment. I just wanna vent some!

&amp;#x200B;

Okay so now onto the story:

I feel I am never doing enough... I always have this feeling of whatever I am doing is never enough. I could have worked for 10 hours doing heavy lifting helping people in need -- like I was just deployed to do -- but at the end of the day I always feel what I did was never enough. I get noticed for doing good at times but even still... I feel what I have done was not worth the notice because it was not enough... It is never enough. I could have helped 30 people in time of need and each and every one of them be grateful but even then... It does not feel enough. I always have this empty feeling because I always say ""I could have done more"" and ""that was not enough"". I could have been extremely exhausted while doing it and wanna give up because the amount of exhaustion I have... but at the end its still ""not enough"".

Example: I went on deployment for a week because of a natural disaster in X state. I helped a good twenty or thirty people and some of the jobs being major. I was exhausted and tired while doing it but always had this energy to go out and do more. We did more and more for a week straight. We did a lot of work by what others have been saying. I just feel like what I did was not enough to warrant the credit I got this one day. I got credit for doing hard work and before getting the award I was telling myself ""I should have done more. This was not enough. I gotta do more""... Then this award comes and I am shocked because I felt I genuinely did not do much of anything. I could get many people telling me I did positive actions and I will believe this but if anyone or even myself say ""you did good"" I will never believe it. I always have this empty feeling. Like what I did was good for others but to me not enough.

I get this feeling with literally everything. I can see a car accident and be like ""someone probably died"" but I would never think the damage is ""severe"" even though I know its not normal. It could be me saying a speech to my class for school and people telling me it was really good but I feel like I have always missed something and so it was not ""good enough"". I can see someone in a severe situation but I can never grasp onto the actual severity of said thing like shootings and or accidents, etc.. It does not need to be positive for me to feel like it was not that ""severe"" or like it was ""not enough"". 

Example: I see a car accident and this is said to be a very terrible accident. It could be said to be a accident unlike anything anyone has ever seen but to me... I have this weird feeling of ""well... I do not think this is *that* bad."". A example of a positive one would be like the previous. I see the impact it did on people but I still feel this feeling of ""this is not enough"" or ""this is not really *that* big of a deal"" or ""why are they so excited? I only did X thing"". It could be helping them clear their yard of debris from a storm or helping a older person cross the road. It could even be clearing a clustered area so that people who are handicapped could park in front of their home instead of a block away.

It is kinda demotivating for me because no matter what I do or see I always think of it as being ""light"" or ""not enough"" something severe is not really all that bad feeling to me and something very impactful feels very minor. I am unsure what it is or how to change. I want therapy but in my area I can not find any - they are all therapists that only work with you for like two weeks and then leave.

My family has been telling me how proud they are of me for volunteering to help others in need with a organization but to me it just feels like a minor thing. It does not feel ""impactful"". I am happy they are happy of what I am doing but I do not see the world like they do... and it makes me feel different. odd. off. abnormal... and I do not like it.",01Sep2020,1

Basically I’m a very big try hard. And I’m only saying this because everyone calls me that. We recently had trials at my school and for those who don’t know they are our last exams before our big big one which is the HSC. And I honestly feel burnt out and after receiving my marks I have been so u happy that it’s making me want to cry. Not that I haven’t already. I passed 4/6 of my courses and it’s annoying me because I gave my best effort. And it’s not that it’s just be out of the two courses I failed the class average was 40-30 and I was above it. 

My concerns lies, because I have a lot of parental pressure that I’m scared of telling them. My dad already commented last night and after that I wasn’t sure if I’d tell them. It’s just eating me alive tbh. I really wanna be able to score 90’s as an ATAR, but every thing seems far fetched right now. 

On top of that I was in top five for biology but now I’m top 10. The news shocked me.  Not trying to flex or anything. I’m genuinely scared. 

My entire motivation deflated ages ago. My current run is to make my parents happy, they keep pulling up reputation and how they’d me affected if I got a shit mark and I’m trying my hardest sometimes I feel like they don’t understand especially because there schooling system was different to mine. My dad always says that it was much harder for them. What annoys me is that his pressure is making me cry, and if I cried in front of him instead of comforting me he says it’s not the time to cry. 

I’m finding it extremely hard to cope, I have talked to my teacher just yesterday and even he said not to stress and that I’ll get into the University and ATAR i want. But I feel like he is only saying it to keep me at peace cause he knows I overload. He also stated that he knows that the pressure I’m under is immense and that if another student was to deal with that shit they would have been broken and that he doesn’t know how I deal with it. And I’m happy he understands but I’m just at a stage where I feel like a worthless loser who can’t get anything right. I can’t make everyone happy I can’t even make myself happy.

Someone with depression who cuts to get out of things or get what they want. I have been clean for about 2 weeks before she said that and now I can't stop thinking about starting again. I feel horrible. The feeling of feeling like I'm alone came back. I lost all motivation when she said that. I told her that my arms were clean and after she acted like nothing happened.

56,"Country: Guatemala

So, I've been struggling lately with some issues and I would like some suggestions about how to bring closure and move forward.

I (36M) was in a relationship for 3 years that ended with her cheating on me. This hit hard since I completely fell for this girl and helped her on her own family struggles (without giving too much info, she had it really bad). At the time of the harsh break up, she intended me to continue being present in her life, and expected me not to find out about her cheating on me for the longest time possible. We were already been talking (prior to the break up) into moving in together and settle down, so this one really hit hard on me.

I was in therapy for unrelated reasons (I noticed that I had a behavioral change while at work and I wanted to address it for me to get better) and I continued when all this situation unfolded.

The whole breakup and everything has been ongoing for almost a year now, and I would like to move forward, but I've been having problems to do so due to the fact that I have been constantly thinking on her. Don't get me wrong, I've had enough improvement for me not to be in a continual state of insomnia, anxiety, fear, etc. The way I see it is that I've already move past the point where I loath myself to the point where I want to just move forward and start being happy once more.

My therapist (God bless her soul) has given me really good advice and I've never expected to get out of the dark place where she left me (and for anyone reading that's in a similar place in their life, it does get better with time and the right help) but this last bit of the road has been the hardest of them all because of the aforementioned reasons. I've relied on getting out with friends, and having my mind occupied by playing video games. Both of these have lost its appeal (or rather its effectiveness) as COVID's lockdown has made everyone I know unable to get out and video games aren't simply cutting it.

Now, I would like to know, do you have any tips or suggestions on how I can finally put the final nail in the coffin of what happened to me and completely move forward? How can I finally get my brain to let her go (like, make my subconscious understand that she will no longer be in my life as she decided that I wasn't worth even a clean breakup)?

Thanks for any help you can provide.

I feel like a way to help my brother is to get him to accept his diagnosis. I have no idea how to do this. I am a Registered nurse but nothing in school could prepare me for this. I love my brother. Please help. My advice is appreciated.",01Sep2020,1
58,"Can anyone help me understand my father-in-law? Some say he's mildly autistic, some say narcissistic, some say it's from his head injury, and some say it's because he uses and is never really sober. You can't talk to the guy. It's like his brain is incapable of stopping and listening to other people talking to him. He doesn't show interest in having relationships or connections with people. But sometimes laments about relationships he never formed with his grandkids. He group texts random thoughts to us, but doesn't respond back if I reply. He doesn't want to hold a back and forth conversation. He just wants to say what he wants to say, have you hear it and that's it. It's not for me. But I'd like to understand why he's like this.",01Sep2020,1

So if I know this about myself whats the point of going to therapy if I know I’m not willing to put in the effort? The insights are interesting sure but I just feel like a massive time waste. I don’t want to change, not because I don’t want to get better but because change is just too fucking hard and I don’t give a fuck about anything anymore. People can just do whatever. I just sit and wait around to die. Not proud of myself but putting in the work to become who I want to be? I won’t even take my meds when they are right in front of me. For absolutely no reason other than that I genuinely don’t care about myself or anything much at all. 

Maybe if I had a husband/kids relying on me I’d be motivated enough to get better for their sake (though I’m probably just saying this to make me feel better about myself, who knows if it’s true?) 

I know this not how I SHOULD think. I know that’s “irrational” and I’m not proud of it. I know it’s my own fault and I do not feel sorry for myself. I’m just tired of pretending it’s not how I feel just because I’m not supposed to feel this way.

62,"I was scrolling through my Insta feed, looking fondly on my old photos from Fall of 2016 - Current day and I noticed something interesting...my insta post show when I started losing a lot of happiness in my life and became more depressed. 

From the Fall of 2016 until about Spring 2018, I was doing awesome in my life. I had a great partner, awesome friends, was enjoying school , exercising and just overall feeling great. During that time I would post goofy, funny and fun pictures on my insta, with longer captions that were also similar. 
Things changed in 2018 from a few events, and I starting feeling very low in my life. Now I was depressed in 2014/2015 as well, but then it was a lot of crying , binge eating and feeling sorry for myself. This was becoming something different. I was more numb and didn’t care about anything anymore and just do not feel much joy in life. 

Anyway, my insta post since then are much more to the point, and have a line of two of caption. There’s no extra thought, or any jazz in it like it used to have. I couldn’t even imagine how I would try to post something like I did back a few years ago now.  

But currently I’m in therapy, and trying some new things to hopefully help me get my spark back to life. I just wanted to share a random thing about me that I noticed this evening.",01Sep2020,1

66,"A month ago I've been dealing with my anxiety badly. One thing that also triggered me was the guy I dated for like 5 months. Everythings really good. He's been understanding. I sometimes treating him like a crap or me showing an awful attitude. He never gets mad. Although I feel like he is mad but he never upfront about it.

Tbh, I was diagnosed with depression during highschool. I was seeing my family doctor for a theraphy once a week (currently not anymore) I'm aware the fact that I'm not capable to handle complicated/confusing situation or being emotionally in pain/distress.. The last few weeks were rough. He didn't do anything but his presence in my life was making me feel insecure, like I'm nothing and I was scared anytime he would probably ghost me. I'm never pushy. Whenever he's like out of contact or I could received late replies I never asked him why because I don't wanna be the clingy one. 

Something happened I didn't text him for like two or three days then I just text him again as if nothing happened I didn't apologized. After that I thought we're all going fine, cause I just came over to his house. I would text him in the morning and he would reply me at night which I'm already asleep. That was the routine for like two days then he got completely vanished. I tried to move on. I decided to focus on myself now. I'm really doing great cause I feel better. I could breath. I'm not throwing up anymore whenever anxiety attack because I haven't experiencing it anymore. Everything is really better.  


Two weeks I've been good. BUT, He texted me back all of a sudden that he is sorry that he got busy with school.

What should I do?

TL: The guy I dated triggered my anxiety the last few weeks we've been dating. Every night I throw up or cry because I'm so confuse with everything. I'm aware the fact that I'm not capable of handling emotional distress situation. When he didn't respond, I didn't bother to text. I decided to focus on myself again. But all of a sudden, he texted me. What do you think I should do?",01Sep2020,1

My dad has also caught a razor in my room and know I self harmed before and just asked me to give it back without asking why I had it. Iive been to a mental hospital before but only for like two weeks. They seem to ignore any signs of depression which I even told them I was depressed they just said it's because I don't talk to anyone. I don't fucking know what to do anymore. They ignore everything.

69,"So background is that I had an awful childhood. Grew up in an abusive, neglectful household. Was forced to take care of my siblings (who I didn't have a good relationship with either) and not allowed out of the house much (greatly inhibited any friendships). Parents always fought and had to deal with a severely disabled child who made the household a living hell.

I was always a pretty chubby kid 5'11 200 at my biggest.  I was never popular in school either. Was kinda weird from my lack of socialization and being gay was a kicker.

Anyways, once I became an adult and hit college... I excelled. I became SGA President at my school at one point and am months away from finishing my master's degree. I still struggle to make friends and have health problems that have hindered my sex life some (though I am trying haha) but am in a much better life situation.

During COVID, I had more time to myself and capitalized on this from going from a ""skinny-fat"" build to an extremely toned/cut body type (Down to 135). I have hated my body for years and now I love it...too much.

&amp;#x200B;

Not having anyone who cared about me as a kid means that now I use my body to get attention all the time. I have gotten really bold about what I post on social media almost like I want to get in trouble with what I post because it would get me more attention? I know 100% it comes from never having built self-esteem and still having close to none. This would be fine if I was 14, but as a 23 YO young professional, it scares the shit out of me knowing my mind is so desperate for this.

Any advice (IK I need counseling and will try to get it at some point)?",01Sep2020,1
70,"I'm in my last year of school and today was the first day back from summer. Completely virtual. But the minute the day ended, it was like this huge wave of anger and sadness and fear hit me. I've always had problems with school. I have skipped school a lot in the past because the stress just always felt like too much for me. It makes me wonder how others have been able to keep up, or maybe it just isn't such a big deal for them as it is for me-- and why I can't work like them. 

I moved to U.S., a few years ago and so my first year here, I was able to go to school continuously for a short bit without any skipping, but my problem started again in the second semester of that year, and since then it has just been getting worse. I just feel like I cannot keep up with the work. It's not even like it's a lot, but I don't know why I am not able to take it easily. My anxiety has been worsening and I feel like I'm just a few more steps away from getting a full blown panic attack. 

I think that I'm depressed. I have absolutely no interests in anything, I don't sleep good, I have a really low self-esteem, there are a lot of irritation and anger problems, and my appetite fluctuates a lot-- I could eat just one meal or snack a day or I can end up eating a lot.  My mind is just empty most of the day and lately I've been questioning my life.

I want to see a psychologist or a therapist but my family always makes me feel guilty for thinking of seeing one because they tell me that they would say the same things that my family is telling me, which is to get up, go to school, and repeat and that there's no escaping that and it's just how life works. I got, literally, one 'B' last year, and my family still finds ways to taunt me about it and they know how much I struggle with keeping up with school considering I used to skip a lot before quarantine. I had skipped the whole one week right before it was announced that my school would be closing down for the rest of the year. 

I cannot afford to see a doctor on my own either. I will turn 18 in less than two weeks, but I'm not sure if that opens up any kind of options for me. I want to get a job so that I can get away from my family, because they've been a huge part of my problems since I can never please them and they have expectations that I could never fulfil, but I don't know if I'm in a state where I could maintain a job and be consistent with it, unlike school.

I feel so helpless and I don't know what to do. Everyday, my mind seems to be getting just a bit more crazier. I don't know what I'm asking here for either-- maybe it's just a vent. I'm terrible at expressing myself and I don't know if I was able to say what I wanted to in here, but thank you for reading. I would appreciate it if you had any advice for me either, but thank you either way!",01Sep2020,1

73,"This mainly involves problems from one of my best friends from college, let’s call him Evan. Evan and I became pretty good friends pretty fast when we met. He was a very cool guy and was someone who seems to always be down for anything. What caught my eye when i met him though was he was so extremely hot, and there’s a certain feminine side to him that made me think just maybe he might be gay. But if not he’s a great friend nonetheless. Turns out he’s not, but i kind of couldn’t shake the small feelings i had for him away; but they’re nothing drastic. I love my guy friends and all my close friends are straight males, i’m not the flamboyant type i just like a good bromance with the bro’s. Adding to that however, i sometimes accidentally fall for my guy friends. I don’t want to! I keep trying to shake it and shake it but it just doesn’t fucking work. I hate it because i just want to be normal, one of the guys, shit like that, but sometimes you accidentally fall for people and you can’t help it. Ive beat myself over the head with this shit for as long as i could remember. Ive never had a boyfriend because mainly all the guys I fall for are my straight friends, and sometimes it causes complications. It’s made me depressed, i always feel like i have to walk on eggshells with myself about what i do or say in front of my friends because i don’t want them to get the wrong idea. Anyway, flashback to Evan. He’s a great fucking guy, ambitious, strong, tall, beautiful hunk of a man - never seen someone more perfect in my life - and we’re good friends. Flash forward some time and I see him less and less because he gets a girlfriend. Luckily it’s one of those friendships you can go not talking to for a while and then act like nothing happened when you do. Anyway toward covid and everything i see him a bit more and he goes back home in another state, i miss him a lot. I’m a type of guy to miss people a lot, i care for my friends. But with him... i missed more than normal. He comes back down a few weeks later and stays with his girlfriend for the rest of the spring school year and i come visit them as they come visit me. But every time i saw him it wasn’t just him anymore, it was him and his girl. Not that I have a problem with it but I want that 1:1 bro time sometimes. On top of that, every time I saw them it made me depressed as it does now. They’re a cute couple and that’s something i’ve never had. In due time I started to really actually fall for him. I started to think about him constantly, wait for his next text, call, anything - and since he’s a guy who sucks at texting or calling it made me hurt more. I know he’d never love me the same way, but I still just wanted to talk to him but also not annoy. I hate how, every time I hang with them it makes me sad. I feel kind of like a third wheel although they see us like a friendly trio. I see him loving her and no one loving me. I don’t want to like him, i want him as my friend and that’s it, but my fucking mind won’t let that change. I want to be normal and not like guys, i want to be one of the bro’s, why the fuck do i have to live like this all the time always a prisoner in my own emotions. What do I do? Sorry this was kind of ranty; my thoughts are everywhere. If any clarification is needed lmk in the comments. 

tl;dr: Im gay and I hate it. I want to be one of the bro’s. One of my best friends is a cool dude; my bro. We hang a lot. I fall for him. I don’t want to. He gets a girlfriend. I get jealous. I don’t know how to cope. Seeing them together makes me sad. Fuck the gay life.",01Sep2020,1

I don’t want to diagnose myself by any means because I know that’s a serious claim to make, but I’m starting to think I have a personality disorder such as NPD. I love to be the center of attention when with other people and monopolize conversations when possible, and eventually I start to realize I’m an asshole and isolate myself for a few days to a week. Then I’m back at it again. It’s a shitty feeling. I also can’t take much criticism but give it out freely (obviously unwarranted). I am obviously aware of these behaviors and tell myself to stop acting that way, but I continue to do so. I don’t know if these behaviors are out of the ordinary or if I’m over analyzing normal behavior. I also notice a trend of meeting friends, loving the time I spend with them, then dropping them after 2-3 years. I find it hard to reach out to people and maintain contacts with old companions. I also have sometimes severe health anxiety which probably cripples me a few hours, one/two days a week.  Let me know if this is normal or I should be concerned!

There is a group of people at my college who have never particularly been fond of me. One student even took the time out of his day to tell me he would pick out my insecurities one by one if I didn’t stop “talking shit about him” aka expressing my fear and irritation about him having gatherings and meeting strangers on dating apps. 

I go to a university and I am doing everything I can to have us not shut down, as a junior in college I am preparing for my senior year and the importance that comes along with that. As a singer it is ESSENTIAL for my training to be in person. Despite the current global pandemic I was aware that these people have been partying. But have not said anything, I have told friends about my irritation but nothing beyond that. 

This past Friday there was a party thrown, admits this pandemic... I was informed of the party but did nothing to report, or retaliate against this group of people. 

Saturday morning I woke up to a conversation between my roommate and the student who had accused and attacked me earlier this summer stating that they think it was me who reported then even though I didn’t, I don’t care enough about them to do that it’s not my problem (even though I should care bc they’re putting the community in danger) but IT WAS NOT ME... I think I would remember calling our schools public Saftey and reporting a bunch of people. 

I messaged the student defending my innocence and he said “okay I believe you” but in the past this student has been aggressive and has threatened me socially. These kids know that I smoke weed and sometimes party NOT DURING A PANDEMIC THO... I’m scared they’re going to try to ruin my life. How should I proceed to protect myself if their behavior becomes aggressive or gossipy? I’m afraid these kids are going to tell the school I have sold an edible to another student or smoked at a party... I am having so much fear and anxiety i can’t sleep. I just need a reality check like a reminder and help on what I can do.

Ever since i was around 14 or 15 i’ve started to become completely disassociated from the world. i can’t feel anything most of the time and when i do it’s usually a strong strong strong amount of sadness or anger.

82,"My boyfriend has OCD. Trying to help him cope.

TL;DR - Boyfriend with mild OCD had first severe attack last night, wondering how I should be responding when this happens. 

My boyfriend is 18 years old. We’ve been extremely close for 2.5 years, dating for a year and half. He was diagnosed with OCD when he was very little, but it was always very mild and sometimes even nonexistent, according to him and his mom. Last night he had what seemed like a severe OCD attack for the first time since I met him and I barely knew how to help him. I feel so bad. How can I help him in the moment? I know that treatment is important and we may look into medication if this persists, but how do I help him and deescalate while it’s happening?

If it helps, the attack he had was because he was cleaning/reorganizing his room (not because of OCD - he just needed to tidy up) and he was organizing his pens. Suddenly he was panicking saying he couldn’t do it right and he kept rearranging them over and over, getting increasingly distressed. He kept doing it for around ten minutes until he managed to “fix it”. He’s usually really grounded so I wasn’t sure how to respond. I tried to hold him and I spoke soothingly saying that it was okay and that nothing bad would happen if he didn’t fix the pens. He said he wouldn’t be able to sleep if he felt that things were “wrong” so I just stayed with him and said, like, affectionate/calming things until he managed. After he had organized it correctly, he said it was still bothering him and he kept fidgeting with the pens for a while. 

I really want to support him in difficult times. Hated seeing him so upset, and I don’t have OCD or know anyone else with it so I’m not sure what I should and shouldn’t say. Any help is appreciated.",01Sep2020,1

Do they really? When? I’m just a kid, I don’t know how I’m meant to make things better. I try my hardest but I feel like every time I try to get up I’m beaten back down. I’m semi-functional at worst, although there are some days where I can’t even get out of bed. I just feel so alone all the time. I go to therapy but it’s provided by the government so due to end soon. We haven’t got the money to continue doing it. I don’t even know if I can afford university. It’s always been my dream to go, and I’m applying for the best schools in my field, but it all feels like it’s a useless charade. 

And the worst part is that I feel like such a dick for complaining about this. I feel like I should just weather it all. I also know that’s illogical and that my feelings aren’t invalid, etc etc. There’s some disassociation between what I know is logical and healthy and what I know is affecting me negatively. But there’s no recourse, no break. Whenever I think things will get better, they get worse. I don’t want to live my life like that, but I also don’t want to die. I feel so hopeless all the time. 

I’m sorry for making this so long. I don’t know if this is the right sub or anything. I just didn’t know who to talk to or what to say.",01Sep2020,1

93,"Hello everyone,

I am a 24y old female and was before married for 2 years and for 7 years in a relationship. Broke up/divorced because he cheated on me. I have been in a new relationship for over 2 months now...but I am not sure of loving this person. I have tried breaking up with her 2 times already and I keep coming back and she keeps taking me, even though I am not sure of loving her. The first time that I broke up I had the worst panic and anxiety attacks because I felt lonely and saw myself alone and unloved...Before meeting her I was single for \~9 months, and it was a living hell. It got so bad that I had to call the help hotline. The second time it was the same...there was a moment when I thought I was going to die. I am considering therapy. Does anyone have experience? I know that I should solve this issue so that I do not depend on people...but I think the fact that I am alone in a country with my family being far away is contributing a lot to this since I've got nobody here.

What should I do? Exposure therapy would basically destroy me because I've got nobody except friends.",01Sep2020,1
95,"So I have been having a lot of concerns with my mental health lately. I realized some feelings I had weren't normal and could be associated with metal health problems (mainly depression). I decided to take to Google and multiple tests said I was mildly-severly depressed. I wanted a final answer before talking out about it, so I'm turning to reddit. About 2 years ago I noticed how sad and unmotivated I was getting. I wasn't exactly sure why, but it didn't concern me enough to look into it. My happiness kept decreasing and more problems in my life started to overwhelm me. In 2019 I was at an all time low. I didn't feel like ever getting out of bed, I hardly ate, I began hating how I looked, acted, and much more. Thats when horrible thoughts flooded in. I wanted to end my life more and more with each day coming, and I started hurting myself too. Scratching my wrists and legs until I bled became normal, and thoughts of leaving the world became more appealing. This continued on until the end 2019. In 2020 I felt less stress and the suicidal thoughts seemed to be less common. I still often hurt myself and struggled with accepting how I looked, but things seemed to get better. Until one friend, one person, one comment, had ruined it. The friend knew all about my problems, and I often complained to her about them. But in early 2020, she texted me one thing before cutting me out completely. She said ""You'll never be good enough. I don't care about your problems, just give up."" I couldn't handle it. Again, I spiraled down into my emotion madness. That's were I am today. Now the question is, am I just sad or is this something I need to talk about? I've always been taught that because I'm young I cant be depressed, I'll be sad for a bit then feel better. I live in good conditions and have a caring family yet I feel distant and get horrible thoughts. Should I be concerned or just grow up and stop being such a baby?

97,"Sorry if this vents a little bit I'm new here by the way.

I just needed to get something off my chest her someone to hear me... I've kind of discovered how hard covid has hit me. I was laying in my bed and was thinking about my mental health. And as I stared more I could see the cracks. Now I can't discredit my girlfriend she's helped a lot. but I keep carrying on like this. I'm not thinking of committing suicide or anyting I just need someone to hear me to hear my voice.  To be honest I was in a pretty bad place... I have no social contact other than my mother, my girlfriend, and my grandparents.  I feel trapped like I have nowhere to go. I'm trapped in my room every day waking up the exact same four walls. I'm dreading School my classmates are less than let's just say the best. I'm basically in solitary confinement other than the occasional trip to the store. Helping out my grandparents, or the occasional trip outside my room for some food.  (Which I got into a little bit of a problem with earlier tonight but I'll get to that.) I have no social contact outside of the three people I mentioned, and maybe discord and Twitter but but other than those three people, no human faces. Because of my severe lack of social contact I started getting more depressed. I can see the cracks in my persona of mr. Nice guy who can help everyone. When someone asks me to do something I can feel this twinge of anger, and hatred, and rath building up inside of me. But I push it down and put on a fake smile asking what's up what do you need me to do. I've noticed that then more and more someone asks me to do something the worse and worst my feelings get, and the more they start building up and getting worse. I fear that I'm eventually going to reach your breaking point. Not to mention I'm going back to school which I'm terrified about. Because of my emotional state I fear that my breaking point will come with one of my classmates. Not to mention I've had anger issues and homicidal thoughts in the past. Pretty severe homicidal thoughts to the point of me making a plan, and very much contemplating killing someone. I feel like I'm getting more fragile and the slightest little tap on the glass will make it break. Not to mention let's just say my classmates are less than ideal... Basically oblivious to their actions and severely juvenile and incredibly annoying. But with all of that with fear and anxiety I isolate myself more. That comes with depression, and depression comes with stress eating and stress eating comes with well weight gain. I'm not too much of a fan of my figure right now I've tried dieting along with everything else. Though unfortunately tonight I got to the point of contemplated cutting off my food supply entirely, and just relying on exercise and water to sustain me... Borderline Anorexia. I just, with all of this coming towards me. With school me being terrified of going to school hoping to God that I don't brake and try attempted murder. Along with contemplating cutting off my food supply and everything else. I'm lost I need help I don't know what to do. I want to find people just like me with my own interests and everything else... But I don't know where to start. As well because of covid-19, I can't go out and meet people and join clubs and stuff. So yeah I'm lost. and it doesn't help my mind is going to bad places. I've stared into the void for too long and it's stared back, not only that it's pulled me right back in and I'm feeling like I'm drowning.

99,"I decided to go on medication for anxiety and depression, it was a tough decision to make because everyone lets you know their opinion, and everyone has something different to say.
I was prescribed Escitalopram 10mg and took 5mg first two days. On the night of the first 10mg dose I had horrible side effects. I had this acute feeling of dread and a stinging/pins and needles feeling all over my body. I slept terribly and felt shocking the next day (nausea, increased anxiety).
I’ve only taken 5mgs the last two days since this happened. Dr said I should go back up to full dose tomorrow. I don’t know if I should because I’m terrified of having those side effects again. They were scary and I don’t think it’s worth it to feel so bad. Dr said the side effects will calm down and said this SSRI is one of the milder meds for side effects (I don’t consider the side effects I experienced to be mild by any stretch of the imagination).
I’m weighing up three choices but I don’t know what’s right:
- listen to the dr and go up to 10mg tomorrow, risk the same bad side effects, and risk the medication not being helpful anyway 
- take only 5mg for another couple of days before going up to 10mg and same risk of med not being effective
- stop taking them tomorrow and ask dr to request blood test that assesses the suitability of medications to your genetics (pharmacogenetics), and then go on the med that the test shows is most suited to me.

100,"This is long and I’m sorry. But I hope you take the time to come 
I am engulfed in self pitty. The voice in my head, relentless. I don’t know where to go but today was my first real suicidal thought and I need somewhere to turn. Also I am sorry if this is the wrong reddit. I didnt think this fit in /relationshipadvice. 

I have always been addicted to video games, and since about the age of 16, weed as well. I constantly hid in my virtual world to escape my parents divorce. To escape eventually basically anything that bothers me to this day. 

I was in a wonderful relationship and the lady truly adored me and likewise. I hadn’t dated years before her because my high school sweetheart cheated on me in college after four years. It took a lot of time to get over that and I waited carefully to pick just the right girl... and I found her. Bubbly, beautiful, and the works. Very independent and I thought it was great. Her house was a wreck, but so was mine lol. 

We move in together and it’s great, we get a dog and love it very much. But I got news that my grandmother had dementia and the thought of losing her is mind breaking to me. My fathers health is also rapidly declining... and I am so broken I run to my cave... and press play. And I press play... and i press play. And my girlfriend coming in to check on me, and and asking to spend time with me... which i grunted reluctant yesses. And those interactions happen less and less and now it’s been months and months of this. 

I know I’m a shit person. I wake up every day calling myself an asshole.worthless, you name it.  I’d look at her and even ask myself why she was there. Why don’t I do something about it?  But she would always assure me she loved me for me and understood what I was going through. That meant a lot but even still it had been a long time of me behaving this way. 

I could feel myself just withering away and eventually even lost pleasure in what once comforted me most. I couldn’t hide it anymore and started to give her all the attention I could... but at this point she was going to her friends house more and more. And the times I got to see her weren’t as many as I could before. I realized how bad I’d messed up.

I took her out on a date to wherever she wanted. And we went to the skating rink. I had a blast with her and it felt like everything would be alright. And it felt great to be a part of society and be around people. Even though I had no desire to speak to any of them. 

After, we had drinks and over a beer she told
Me she enjoyed the extra time I’d given her and wants to move to her friends so that I’ll realize what’s I’m missing and actually want to talk to her. I told her I would be devastated and didn’t think I could take it. I told her to give me a month to prove that I could do it this time. I felt her really slipping away and it scared me. 

I come home from work and bring her some
Food. And we have some fun before she goes to her friends. As we are cuddling after I notice her phone is unlocked on the Snapchat screen with multiple men on it. We had always promised to just break up with each other before we ever cheated on each other. We discussed that we’d both been cheated on before and it was the worst way to do it.  We agreed so I never bothered with checking her phone and such. 

I ask her why she has multiple
Guys on Snapchat and demand to see what they are saying. She gives me the run around saying she ignored them. But the messages were from
Five minutes ago so I told
Her if she doesn’t show me the messages then we are done because she is definitely hiding something. 

I realize it’s actually unlocked and open the message to a guy saying “I’d love to see more of
That.” Or something to that extent. I click the other message and I can only see a video of her... getting naked. I lose my mind. I immediately Pack my things and leave. I ask her how she feels and she says that I should have paid attention to her and not played so many damn games. (Obviously.) i agree but am so saddened that she cheated on me. I wish she’d had just broken up with me. I am shaking terribly
Just recalling the whole event.

I called my mother frantically telling her I wanted to put a bullet in my head. (I own a ruger). She told me she has my grandmother in the car and they were going to a nearby attraction and they she was coming to get me and my dog. She is an absolute blessing. I could not be there and even hear her voice anymore. 

I am about to go to sleep and we will
Enjoy the attractions as much as we can tomorrow with my grandmother which is a great start... but i am still overcome with adrenaline and anxiety and I am having a hard time composing myself around my grandmother. 

If you even read this far... thank you. I can’t believe I let this happen to me and what I had going for me. I want to go to therapy to try to see what’s wrong with me to appreciate myself... but all my momentum is lost and i feel farther than I’ve ever felt in my life. I just want to be better than I am. 

Thank you.",01Sep2020,1

107,"Here’s the story from the Facebook post. Link to the post at the end.

I have been suffering from anxiety and sleep issues for a while now. It has gotten really bad amid this pandemic so I went to Bangladesh Medical College &amp; Hospital for professional help about 2 weeks ago. I have been seeing a psychiatrist (won't name them here). I got diagnosed with panic disorder. I was doing fairly well with the medicines I was prescribed and I had been asked to do a follow up last Thursday. 

As planned I went there on Thursday at 10 am. I entered the chamber and saw my doctor sitting with another doctor. I sat down and started telling my psych about how my anxiety had been a little bad last week in English. I couldn't finish my sentence before the other doctor went like ""Apni ki banglay kotha bolte paren na?"". Well I didn't know I had to speak in Bangla for whatever reason. My shrink didn't stop me last week when I talked in English the whole time so who is she right? Anyway I said ""ji pari"" and continued speaking in Bangla. 

They both were assessing me. Asking me questions and all but I was very uncomfortable with a third person involved here so I told my shrink that I'm not comfortable with another doctor in here. I don't know why I was told that Dr Chowdhury Maria Hasan will be here in my sessions from that day. I definitely did not ask for it but I didn't say anything yet. After saying that, my shrink had to leave me in the hands of Dr Maria. Later I got to know that he had to see a violent patient urgently or sth. 

Anyway, so dr maria started talking to me in English herself. She started asking me why I'm anxious. I really don't have a specific reason for this so I said I don't know. She started talking about her personal life, to make me feel like I can open up I guess but the fact stands that, I don't really have a story to tell here unless I'm asked specifically about something.

However, while she was talking, at some point it started to feel like she was comparing herself with me. She started showing me her pictures in pants and shirt and told me that she doesn't usually wear kameez at work. Like I care about that? She kept telling me how she graduated from Cambridge and that her father is the head of the psychiatry department. I don't know what she was trying to prove here. I just nodded and smiled throughout. So after she felt like she was done talking about herself she repetitively kept asking me why I'm here and what is the reason for my anxiety. I told her I'm here for anxiety, panic disorder. She said no you can't diagnose yourself. I tried to tell her that it's written in my previous prescription (which she was holding in her hand) but she kept saying how I can't diagnose myself. I tried telling her that my shrink diagnosed me last week but she wouldn't even let me finish my sentence and made it seem like I'm self diagnosing. Then she started asking me the same goddamn question, ""what is the reason for your anxiety?"" even though I answered her 5 times that I don't know what you want me to say here. She then starts telling me how she's wasting her precious time on me if I'm not going to talk. I had already paid so I immediately told her that maybe I should leave because it's not working out for me but she said that I CAN'T LEAVE UNTIL I TALK. I was very uncomfortable from the start and she was just adding to it. She forced me to stay. I felt like I was trapped already. I got visibly irritated and I told her that this is my first time interacting with you and I'm uncomfortable but I couldn't even say the whole thing before she glares at me and says ""Lower your voice"". I honestly thought that maybe somehow she felt disrespected/offended so I started apologizing. But she wouldn't even take my apology, she said that I'm not actually sorry because she can see it on my face, that she's a psychiatrist for a reason. I tried apologizing again but this time I added that ""respect goes both ways, if you can't respect me, how can I respect you?"". She admitted that she was being a little rude to me when I wanted to leave.

Right after that she had a call or text I don't remember so she got busy with it for a minute. I grabbed my phone to text someone to take me out of here but she stopped me. She said I can't touch my phone. I politely asked why, she said you can't touch your phone while you're in a doctor's chamber. Who made that rule? I couldn't even text or make a call for a minute? But it's completely fine when she does it? 

I had to put my phone down and sit there until she was done. She finally started asking me specific questions to which I had answers for. It's not like my responses were delayed because I can't open up or sth. You ask me specific questions and I will have specific answers for you. However, she made it about herself. She started telling me how she's so good at getting information out of me and that she's a psychiatrist for a reason. I said yeah, you asked me particular questions. Didn't know what the big deal was here. 

After 'assessing' me, she said that I don't have anxiety (uh, are you saying I don't know how I feel?). She said that I have severe depression and that she can see it on my face. I didn't say anything. My top priority was to get out of there as fast as possible and deal with my wrong diagnosis later. She started writing her diagnosis (some of them I did not agree with because she based it on a single incident) on the back side of my previous prescription including prescribing me heavy anti-depressants. She then asked and put it exactly like this ""You won't do the follow up with me, will you?"". I honestly said that no I'm not comfortable. She said to do it with my shrink and I agreed. Then she left the room for a minute or two and came back to ask me if I have money. I said I already paid and showed her the ticket. She took the paper and started writing her diagnosis again BUT she started adding some things that she didn't write on the previous prescription. She added behavioral problems, ALCOHOLISM etc. I was being calm and nice, I didn't say a goddamn thing because I kept thinking I'll be out of here soon.

As she kept writing on the prescription, she told me ""Do one thing, don't come to me again. Ever"". I honestly told her I didn't come to her in the first place. She lost it. She started shouting at me. She said ""shut up. Shut the fuck up. Don't say anything. You think you're oversmart because you wear pant and shirt. You're not oversmart. You're undersmart. Understood? Understood?"" I was so shocked, I didn't have an answer. She went back to writing while saying things like ""I don't care. I don't give a shit about you. I DON'T FUCKING CARE WHETHER YOU LIVE OR DIE. I'm just doing my job. 500 taka diye tumi amake ar dr A (my shrink) ke kine nao nai. Because you took B's name (the person who suggested dr A), I was just playing with you. I had my mask on"". She started saying how so many bad things have happened to her but she knows manners and that I didn't have any. She kept insisting that I disrespected her the whole time and she had been trying to help me for 2 hours. 

I didn't say a word. I just stared. 

In the mean time, this staff came in to give her coffee and she told the staff ""Ei patient ta ke chine rakhen. Hae ei patient ta. O jano amar chamber er ash pashe na thake."" I felt so insulted and humiliated but I didn't say anything. I was extremely anxious at that point. I felt like I was going to have a panic attack right there. Even after all of this, she wasn't done. After the staff guy left, she looked at me and told me ""You have two options. I will give you two options. You can go home or YOU CAN GO BEHIND THE BARS. I can put you to jail with this 'history' you have because I have the authority to do that."" My head was spinning. I didn't know what this woman, dr chowdhury maria hasan is capable of and I got really scared. I started apologizing, I told her I'm sorry and that if my face looked rude or anything, I really didn't mean it. She said now you will say sorry because I said that right. I tried to tell her that I was sorry the first time too but she shut me up and said ""what did you say to me? that you're uncomfortable and you didn't come to me? how dare you."" I told her I don't know why she's threatening me like this, I don't know what I did to which she said that ""this is not a threat"" (??????). If that's not a threat then I don't know what is. 

To further scare me, she took pictures of my prescriptions with my false history where I have my name and number printed. She threw the prescriptions at my face and said ""Get out. Out now. You're done."" 

I apologized and left.

So this is who Dr. Chowdhury Maria Hasan is. She calls herself a doctor, a psychiatrist. She says she graduated from Cambridge. That she's a mother of two. This vile woman. 

I could have never expected this. I went there to get better. I have been trying my absolute best to get better from this but she single-handedly stomped on my progress and made me feel extremely horrible. My anxiety has trippled since this incident. I haven't eaten a lot since then. I can't sleep much even though I'm back on my previous meds. I keep thinking about again and again. She's responsible for all of this.

I will obviously not generalize this whole thing and say that all shrinks are like her. I have immense respect for each and every kind of doctor out there. She's not a doctor. A doctor would never do such a thing. They would never threaten a patient because the patient is not comfortable doing a follow up with them. They would never speak like that. 

I will not publicly discuss what actions I'm going to take against her. The point of this post is to let everyone know what kind of a person she is. Although I am no one to judge, she didn't seem mentally stable at all. She's currently working as the assistant registrar. She's in a position to see patients like me, to put another patient down, to do what she did to me and I don't wish that on even my worst enemy. I would like all of you to share this and let everyone know to stay away from her.

108,"I’m from the US, specifically Colorado. I’m sorry if this goes everywhere, idk where to start.

My girlfriend’s family has been through so much. Her parents divorced when she was in 7th grade, her mom lost custody of her, and then finally she regained custody and they moved. She met another man and they got together. He was a marine veteran, and unfortunately died just over a year ago from a drug overdose.

It’s just my girlfriend, her younger brother, and her mother in the household. Her mom is verbally and emotionally abusive. 

My girlfriend (let’s call her C) is obsessed with numbers, and she is constantly in competition with herself. She constantly over schedules and overcommits herself to the point of losing hair and getting sick over stress. She thinks it’s because of her constantly switching households when she was younger, and wanting to get attention from her parents.
C knows she needs therapy. She wants it. Her mom won’t let her get it. She goes off in these massive paragraphs of texts and she blames it on C for everything.

C has told me that they can’t get any sort of external intervention. It would just be too stressful. With her stepdad passing away and the pandemic, their financial situation is shitty. Her mom is in tens of thousands of dollars worth of debt and they got evicted from their house and they’re moving in a week.

She can’t afford therapy, and her mom won’t let her get a job because she’s too busy. She can’t go to her school counselor to ask for help because any sort of intervention will lead to her mom getting pissed. Her brother has already tried it.

She is pretty sure her family’s insurance covers therapy. Her mom blames her depression on “hormones”

C is meeting with the school social worker tomorrow, and she’s gonna ask about having a telemedicine appointment with her doctor about increasing her dosage of antidepressants. I just don’t know what to do. Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you if you’ve read this",01Sep2020,1
109,"I count things when I do certain stuffs like brushing my teeth, washing my hands, applying roll-on deodorant, scratching an itch.

110,"I'm 23F, I have a job doing in home activities with my severely autistic brother who I love but can't converse with or much of anything. He doesn't like to do much either. My dad passed away over a year ago and my mom remarried 6 months ago. My mom's husband wants to spend every minute with my mom, and he has even told me that he thinks God wants them to be constantly together. What bullshit. Anyways, I work with my brother at varying times most weekdays but my mom/stepdad (as much as I hate that word) require that I work 100% a full two days every week. It isn't the work that bothers me or my brother. He's not even very hard to take care of tbh most of the time. It's the way my mom/stepdad mostly isolate me on those days. I strongly think it was the stepdad's idea b/c it wasn't like this before. They will barely even talk to me at all or anything. They say they ""need their complete break from him"". But they can't seem to get through their heads that they are always together and have each other constantly for company/support and I have to go w/o that for 2 days straight every week. I'm sure at least some people would think this is nothing but I am in so much emotional turmoil. I have been anxious and depressed and am scared I might be having a nervous breakdown or something. It is at the point now where I want to cry all the time at home and am scared to even be home. I just visited my bf (25M) who lives 2 hours away and I notice I don't really even get a trace of anxiety/depression there but when I get home it comes right back to stay until I leave. It feels like hell. I'm honestly scared I might break any moment and have to go to a mental hospital or something. My mom feels bad that I cry so much and am miserable but still is ignorant about what they're doing to me. My stepdad basically just cares about having his 2 days of total alone time with my mom and thinks I just want attention or to escape responsibilities. He even mostly wants to be alone with my mom on most other days too. I make $20 an hour at my job but idk if it's worth it anymore. I pay $900 per month in rent. My stepdad has no job or income. He is not trying to find any either. He just wants to mooch off us and be with my mom every damn second like it's his right. Please help, thank you...

Tldr: My mom/stepdad isolate me for 2 whole days per week at my job with my autistic brother and I feel like it's literally driving me insane.",01Sep2020,1
111,"I was gonna post on r/relationship_advice, but I don't even know how to structure this. I (M17) have been seeing this girl (F16) for about 3 months now. This is the longest relationship I've had. I like her, she's great, but the past month or so has been up and down and very hard for me to really comprehend. This may get rambly but bear with me, there's a overall theme and question here.

The first couple months I was seeing her were great. Then a month or so ago she invited me to her best friend's birthday/costume ""party"". I went with her, we spent the night and it was a good time, but ever since then things have felt off. I may be making up this arbitrary moment of change, but that's how it seemed to me, even the day after the party it felt off. I guess she just wanted to go home, not a weird thing, everyone else was leaving but that meant she dropped me off at my house and we didn't see each other again that day. She didn't do anything, just hung around her house, and I knew that she was going on a long trip the week after so I asked her if she was free to hang out the next day, the day before she left (the only time I would get to see her before she left for over a week). At first she said yes but then she canceled because she had to pack. Ever since then, I have been on edge, feeling like she's growing away from me. She texts me less and I don't see her as often. The same day she got back from that trip she hung out with friends. Not a big deal, she has more to her life than me, I just hoped that after like 12 days of not seeing her she'd want to hang out. It took until a couple days later for me to see her cause she had to ""unpack"". We hung out, I stayed the night, it was fine, it was fun, but I still couldn't help but shake this feeling of distance.

I've seen her once more since then. Twice in the month of August. Last week she invited me to her house to do schoolwork there together. I was looking forwards to it, but the day of, she canceled saying she forgot it was her aunt's birthday dinner that night. No big deal, we rescheduled for the next day. The next day I got showered, dressed and ready again, and she canceled again. This time it was because of her mom's worry about Covid (long story, I would have had to take an Uber and her mom wasn't comfortable with that). That's not her fault, I get it but it was very disappointing. She said ""maybe we can hang out this weekend"".

So Saturday comes and I haven't even heard from her in 2 days. For whatever reason she just didn't text me for 2 days. I texted her in that time, sending her a song I found, and it took her over 24 hours to respond to that. She was posting on social media so I know she was fine and on her phone. Saturday night I text her asking if she's free the next day. I wake up to her canceling once again, saying that her family was exposed to someone with Covid, and she was laying low and getting tested the next day (today). Now all three times she canceled, I get the reason why, nothing she could have done about it, it just hurts, and on top of all the paranoia and codependence and complete radio silence from her for days, I'm just kind of losing my shit.

Now for the obvious: ""Talk to her, find out what's going on"". I know that's the soundest advice I could get, but I don't feel like I can do that. No doubt I am unhealthy in my attachment, ask my therapist and he'll tell you that my dad was drunk and neglectful when I was younger, leaving me with abandonment issues and low self esteem. I like this girl, I really do, and I'm sure she likes me too but goddamn I have to say I don't feel very wanted. Fuck, I feel like I'm making this shit up, I mean I know she's a good person and wouldn't intentionally hurt me.

How much of this is on me, and how much of this is on her? I mean you've only heard my side of the story, and I've only told you the bad bits, there's plenty of good. I know some of it is on me. I should address these things with her, I just feel like I can't. I don't know what's stopping me, probably fear, I don't want to lose her. I know what this is like and I know what being alone was like, this, as bad as it is, is far better. I enjoy getting to know people deeply. I like a strong emotional connection, but I have got none of that from her. We can talk about free will, the meaning of life or religion just fine, but any time I've (albeit gently) prodded more personal areas, it hasn't gone anywhere. Fuck, I don't even know if I can call her my girlfriend. We've never explicitly established anything beyond ""exclusive"". I can see that the glaring problem here is communication on both of our parts, I swear I just can't fucking do it. I can't risk pushing her away or opening up to her like that and getting hurt or getting an answer I wouldn't like.

I have been in a situation something like this before and the only lesson it taught me was, ""it's far better to be unsure of something than to know for certain and get the bad answer"".

No matter what I feel like my highest priority is I can't lose her. I mean I'm a fucking introvert in quarantine, doing online school, I feel like I struck gold, this relationship pulled me out of the darkest time in my life. I'm too afraid to go plunging back. I know this is textbook codependence. I'm in therapy, but you can't build Rome in a day and this is all happening now. I know all that ""you have to love yourself before you can love others"", I've been working on that for a very long time, I've made progress, I no longer hate myself, I'm working my way to love, I'm not just gonna be single because my dad sucked when I was younger.

I just need some advice, I just want to feel wanted. But I cannot lose her.",01Sep2020,1

114,"I've been working every single day. I get into these frightening bad moods where if my depressed mood is pushed slightly more, I'll start thinking about death, being sick, stuff like that. And its terrifying. So I panic to try to not get to that point. I was temporarily in a good mood, and I wanted to get it on with my bf. Because of this, I've been mentally and physically exhausted a lot.

Right before I was getting further into teasing him, I was kinda feeling lightheaded and a little nauseous, which I'm guessing its either from taking birth control or just me not having the best diet or drinking enough water the past week. Even tho I've been feeling stressed out, upset, and overwhelmed a lot, at that moment, I was in a good mood until I just got into starting to tease him, which of course I didnt want to not finish him off if I already started. I still wanted to feel good as well, and I always try to go thru with it in hopes itll make me feel better. Yet it never really does. I know my bf would've definitely been fine with me changing my mind if I wasnt feeling good, but I didn't want him to know I was feeling like this again. I wanted to make him feel good and see if itd make me feel good as well.

Even tho I did finish him off and he did make me feel good, I felt like a failure, or like I didnt do it as good as I normally did. In the middle of the act, I kind of dried up a bit, getting distracted by stressful thoughts, but I managed to get wet again a bit afterwards. He always let's me know that it was really good and it really helps him sleep for having to wake up early for work, but I still feel like I wasnt the best. I went into the bathroom to clean up and I just started to tear up and get overwhelmed. It was like THAT pushed me into a more depressed state. I should've just talked about it instead. I always think being touched in certain ways will make me physically feel good enough that it will affect me mentally, but even tho it DOES feel good, it almost never fixes my problems of course, which makes me more upset. And I cant seem to stop myself from trying because theres a chance I'll be able to get in a better mood.

Theres so much shit I'm going thru and having to deal with. I don't even know why I'm making this post. I guess I just needed it to get out of my head. I'm definitely going to talk to him about it tomorrow for some comfort and encouragement. Sometimes I wish he and my other friend or 2 could instantly tell that I needed support. Too bad people cant read minds. It's so hard to talk about it. I never know how to make it better.",01Sep2020,2
115,"So i’ve been formally diagnosed with anxiety and depression but i’ve been suspecting that my depression was a misdiagnosis and is instead some kind of mood or personality disorder.

i know this all starts out when i get triggered by something and quickly spirals but it’s only gotten worse the more i recognize it’s there. i think i seem to adopt every bad coping mechanism and make my mental health worse just to sit in the pain and mess i’ve made for myself. i can’t seem to stop. i don’t know if this is just all my own doing and not anything i need a mental evaluation for or not. it makes me feel insane",01Sep2020,1

118,"I'm almost never alone. I'm lucky that I have my young daughter because I almost always have someone with me.

That being said, on very rare occasions, I will find myself completely alone. My boyfriend watches her while I am at work. He will every now and then take her to D&amp;D with him when I don't come home until later at night. I get home before him by hours. I'll go to my parents for as long as I can so I wont be alone, but I still come home before him.

When I am alone... I get this overwhelming rage and the need to hide/run away. If I am alone, I end up severely lashing out and I'll end up breaking something. I end up throwing things, stepping on things, knocking things over. Never anything that is expensive or needed... It's more like, boxes and lawn chairs. After the rage dies a bit, I get overwhelmed with the need to run away or hide. I'll pace around the house, shaking until I find a spot and I'll hide there until my boyfriend comes home. 

I know why this happens. I was in an abusive relationship (after being mentally, physically and sexually abused by my father growing up) where I was stuck in a one bedroom trailer that had plywood floors, holes in the floors/walls, no plumbing (at first until I helped fix it) and slept on an air mattress. He worked offshore so he was gone for two weeks at a time. I wasn't allowed to leave or have a job. (The one time I did leave while he was there, he forced me back inside and forced himself on me as a punishment while screaming how terrible I was.) I ended up rationing out my food for two weeks with nothing but my phone then later his laptop with movies, to keep me entertained. When he came back, he wanted sex 6+ times a day every day, even if I didn't want to (this was how my daughter was conceived). So, when I was home alone, I was in so much pain, I could barely leave the bed because any movements became unbearable (I still struggle with vaginal pain today). I left and went homeless again and found out three days in I was pregnant.

I understand why these emotions happen when I'm alone. Yet, I can't stop it. Nothing I try calms me down. It's come to a point where my boyfriend will refuse to go anywhere if it means I'll be left alone because he doesn't want to find me in the closet every time he comes home. I hate that I end up stopping him from doing things he would like to do because I cant control my emotions. They just flood out of me and I can't stop it. Its like, as soon as I walk through the threshold and see that I am alone, I completely freak out and there is no stopping it. I always try and stay out as late as I can, but the days he goes to D&amp;D, I have work the next morning, so I can't stay out all night long.

130,"!!!TW!!!
Several months ago I posted a vent on this sub saying how I want drama to happen to me and I guess manifestation works. After that post I cleared up my head and got back on track, I was feeling better than ever and forgot about it. However, karma came back to bite me in the ***. Two days ago I went to a party, now that I think about it, it was dumb of me to, since the only people I knew there were several guy acquaintances, who aren't the type to make sure no one drops anything in your drink, if you ask them to keep watch. Of course everyone got intoxicated, everyone to different levels. I have a horrible tendency to pass out and that's exactly what I did. I went upstairs and through a haze I remember that one of those acquaintances joined me, but I didn't pay it much attention. You can most likely already guess where this is going. Although the whole night is a blur, I remember certain parts, those parts are definitely not pleasant. I remember being touched without giving my consent, as I was practically unconscious. This is the third time in the past month or so that I get into a situation where something happens without my consent and although I thought I didn't care, I guess the repetition is starting to take a toll on me. I am sure in what I remember, however, after talking with the guy who went upstairs with me, he kept dismissing it and insisting that he just sat with me for a bit and then left. I think I may be starting to go crazy. I feel so empty, but at the same time I don't really care. I want to cry, but I can't and the last time I was in such a state, the only thing that helped me break through was burning cigarette buds into my skin, just to be able to cry. The only support at the moment is my sister who lives abroad, and a friend, however I think I played the whole situation off for it to seem as a joke. I just want a hug, some honesty and comfort. I spent months building up my confidence and mental health and now I feel like I'm back to square one.  I'm so lost.",01Sep2020,1

132,"Dear past self,

I miss u, I have these past years. I want to just tell you, you made mistakes. Some stupid and some right. You lost too much and gained the worst. These years that took you to become me were similar to how iron is melted and hammered, life struck you at your most vulnerable. You made friends though, with midnight, with asteroids, with the lifeless, with tombs, with dandelions and with the ugly. You changed form every night, someday you burned like lava and some days your soul left your body cold and empty. These days were spent in a bed you were sedated to suffer in and then just when you lost consciousness someone slapped you out of dizziness. You transitioned between a zombie and a shadow. But I am writing to you, that means that day when you almost left, you stopped, you cried and breathed again. You lost yourself piece by piece to become me. You grew by shrinking into your own bone marrow then you jumped out of your veins like a girl that finally came on the surface of the water. You sank in oxygen and lit fire with the carbon of your heart. They said, they looked down upon you, called silently to you in a way that you succumbed to that voice in your head, yes, one day a bunch of guests will evade your mind and drive you to the edge of insanity, you would almost lose it. It will happen in phases, like the moon and like the day, u would rise and fall with the same grace. But you would stay invisible and you would feel people leaving doors of your heart and you leaving their arms. And you would find that fire doesn't burn you but it will make you feel something. Then one day, the limit will come, the day when every particle of being stings and you will leave everything.. not permanently but enough to not reside there, the place that used to be home. You will go back to a place that you lost less and maybe there you would then catch a breath or two. Then you will become me, with fears tattooed in your backbone and dreams that hurts you more. But hold on, take a deep breath, this letter is not to scare you, it is to say that you survived and you know you survived beautifully. It's still dark and the air is stale but you know I have never felt this before, but now I feel like this all has a meaning. A purpose I can sense and maybe, I will be alive again and so will you.

Love,

you (now)",01Sep2020,1

I am hopeless and at the moment not able to see the positive in my life anymore. I have cancer in my spinal cord and almost done with treatment. I have to wait 3 months before i know if the tumours shrunk or i need more treatment.

- my third treatment caused neuropathy and i am getting more pain and less sense and strength from waist down
- relationship with my partner is not working out due to a lot of factors, our lifes are going different directions and he needs more freedom
- due to the breakup with my partner i also lost our tribe: we used to hang out with a large group of artists and mucisians and managed all sorts of events together. He has a big role in all these events and i don't have a role anymore mainly because i am not physically able anymore (and if it would be, it would be too painful for me to be around him a lot because i still want to be with him)
- i made plans to graduate this year and go abroad in january to educate young refugees, but because of my treatment and side effects i am not able to graduate in the near future. I am left with a debt of roughly 100.000 dollars, no degree
- with no degree and with my health issues it is a bad idea to go abroad (it's a poor country and i would have to work 40hrs per week). This is a one time opportunity
- i was into climbing, getting good at it and had to give it up. I can't do what i love anymore and my body is becoming disfigured, i used to look really good
- my body doesn't function really well sexually anymore. I used to be very sexual. 

Cause of these reasons it's really hard for me to keep positive. Like, really really hard. I feel myself slipping into a depression and suffer from anxiety. My (ex) partner is still around because we have to discuss who stays in the house etc, and he is still here for me despite the fact he works almost 60 hours a week and our lifes are going in complete different directions. We still love each other and that makes it even more difficult.

136,"Long story short I have borderline and tried to kill myself a whole bunch of times back in 2018 and then got admitted into a 6 month long dbt program. After I finished that I kept seeing one of the group facilitators privately for one on one therapy. So on the outside I present to most people a put together, presentable, well spoken, smart individual. Sometimes I feel like that’s why it’s been so hard to get help, like doctors and counselors never believe me. I finished university and have had various jobs here and there, nothing that stuck though... doctors, counselors, psychiatrists always tell me “you seem bright” and “you seem smart” and I know it’s a compliment but it just adds to my imposter syndrome. 

My current counselor knows my family situation too, luckily my parents can afford private therapy and she always tells me to lean on them for financial support and it’s kind of annoying. She also doesn’t take me seriously when I brought up attention and focus issues. I really feel like I have adhd but she really undermines me every time I bring it up. I also feel like she expects “better” of me because I went through the dbt course and whenever I’m acting “ineffective” it’s like she’s judging me because she knows I know better. It’s really frustrating and I hate it but I don’t know what to do. 

I spent the last 6 days seriously contemplating suicide and I have an appointment with her this Friday and I don’t feel like she’s going to take me seriously. I’m in grad school and I haven’t been able to retain any information from my readings no matter how hard I try and I’m falling behind because of how much energy I wasted depressed and contemplating suicide the past few days and I feel like she’s just going to judge me and won’t actually help me. I don’t want to drop out of school but I don’t think she would give me a medical note either because she really thinks my condition is “not that bad” and that I should “know better by now.”

I want her to believe me, I want her to believe my struggles are real and that I need help and I want to be able to finish school and I need concessions because I am REALLY falling behind. But she makes me feel like I am just “faking it” and “not trying hard enough.”

Don’t get me wrong, she was a good therapist for dbt and for helping me when I was in a really rough patch but now it fees like she expects me to know all the skills and have all the solutions because I’m “smart” or whatever. But I’m actually fucking struggling and I feel like no one is listening.",01Sep2020,2

138,"I got off medication for depression and Malicious OCD thoughts  about 3 or 4 months ago and ive been chipper...until lately , I've been relapsing alot of my habits. Ever since the #SaveOurChildren movement stuff started all I have been thinking about is killing bad people in horrible ways. I'm not bothered by the fact that I'd kill a Pedophile or a sex offender I'm bothered that my intrusive thoughts are coming back , the ones I cant shake , my repetitive prayers (I'm very religious). I'm scared my depression will come back, I've been staying up all night , sleeping all day , drinking and drinking coffee, staying up REPEAT  and I keep thinking  that the only way to get rid of it would be to hurt the people my thoughts are telling me to hurt and I don't know what to do. I've thought about going to my doctor in private but my family has been so proud that I haven't had any set backs that keep me from going through with getting a job . I've had so many and I'm tired of losing the opportunities, I could be starting Seminary school soon . So please tell me what I need to do .

139,"I (31F) and partner (28M) are bluing at the moment. Hes having a go at me for drinking during the week which I haven't done for the last 3 weeks. We went to court yesterday over his ex putting an AVO on him. 

We dated in highschool, 16 years later he rocks up on my doorstep wanting to get to know me again. I was in the perfect place for a relationship, I'd left kids dad 2 years prior, had been on a self love Nd healing journey for the past year.. even cut my meds with docs approval for 6 months.. I was so ready. 

He on the other hand.. had just left his fiance a month and a half before hand. They left on hideous terms. Cops were involved. Long story short shes a manipulative arsehole. 

Anyway within 3 months I moved over to his family's farm were hell end up taking over one day. Were each others soulmate.. but this shit with his ex is still an on going issue.. because they were buying a house together he's in the middle of a settlement, still hasn't got the majority of his things back.

His family keeps thanking me for being apart of his life ), if he didn't have me ect. He'd probably be in jail. 

I love loving him, and all his shown me is love and affection and protection. Unconditional love for my kids, our kids. And I dont believe for one second that his ex is a decent person. 

Im just frustrated that hes trying to have it over me at the moment for having a drink.

3 weeks ago I broke down and thought I need counciling.. I was in utter tears over it. 

Yesterday was full on at court, today I had a really bad day with both kids under 5 trying to shop. Played up the entire time. 

Tonight I decided fuck it. I need it. He had a go at me and here we are. 

I dunno what I want out of this post. But both kids are fed and are in bed. Im not perfect. And I need to chill the fuck out.",01Sep2020,3

141,"I feel like only positive people are accepted in this world. Today a person I knew told me that she thought I was kinda very negative. Despite trying very hard to survive with my mental illnesses, I felt heartbroken. I did everything I could to change for the better (CBT therapy, art etc) and continuously push myself to do things I would feel extremely anxious at. I felt so heartbroken now.",01Sep2020,1
143,"I just woke up at like 5:00 in the morning with a huge amount of existential anxiety. I was always really into biology, and really into science in general. I used to be fine with the concept of life and death and stuff. But recently over the quarantine, I’ve been given time to question things. Things about the universe and it’s meaninglessness. I used to be fine with that concept too. I was always a big fan of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy books. 

However recently I started thinking about how sometimes I cared when animals and people died and sometimes I didn’t. Like how I could watch a nature show and be perfectly fine (or only a little uncomfortable) with animals killing eachother, I was completely fine killing things in videogames (usually, there are times when I felt bad about that), there are times when death was used for comedy like in a lot of Far Side comics and Monty Python skits and I laughed, there are times when life seemed extremely precious like when I worried about my dog running away or when I’d see ASPCA ads on TV, and at the same time I could feel nothing while eating a hamburger, and other times I’d freak out and feel sad when I stepped on a bug, and then there are times when I’d watch action movies or read comics and not feel bad when sometimes characters died, yet in other movies and comics I felt really sad when certain characters died, I’d always get sad when a dog or other animals die in a movie or books, but I was also fine looking through my university’s specimen collection, and downright exited to look for fossils which are essentially the petrified corpses of once living things... I think you get the idea.

Anyway, due to some other things that I’ve posted on here before, I’ve started to have more of an aversion to the concept of violence and death as a whole (as well as sexual stuff but that’s beside the point) as well as feel like my emotions and sense of empathy aren’t working the way they used to.

It feels like after I’ve faced the void of existentialism, I don’t know when life matters and when it doesn’t. Like when am I supposed to care that someone or something dies or is suffering? Why did I laugh at a character’s death or suffering in a TV show? Why am I fine with animals killing and eating eachother? Why do I sometimes feel bad when watching nature documentaries but not others? Why do I get a rush playing a survival video game where you kill your opponents? Why does certain things arouse me? Why does that bother me now? 

I feel like I’m suddenly aware of just how violent the world is, and I’m suddenly not okay with it, (or not okay with the fact that I was okay with it) that as I’m writing this I’m calming down, but I was freaking out. 

I was suddenly super aware of how life forms were not only killing eachother all the time, but also adapted for the purpose of doing so. Things that I used to find cool or interesting regarding that now kind of freak me out. I get intrusive thoughts about how I’m a part of that violent universe. I’m getting intrusive thoughts sometimes about killing things and it’s honestly disturbing. I’m getting intrusive thoughts about animals killing eachother, something I used to be fine with to an extent. I’m getting intrusive thoughts of animals being dead or partially consumed, I’m getting intrusive thoughts of things dying or being dead and I hate it. I started thinking about how every day trillions of things are alive just to die. 

I feel like I either have apathy or anxiety when I think of violence and death now. Both of those feelings terrify me, but honestly I prefer the anxiety because it makes me feel more human. As I’m writing this the metronome inside my mind has swung the other way, and now I’m thinking of violence and death as fine. I think of all the times when I had intrusive thoughts about me killing things, most of these are fairly recent. Sometimes in my past when I was a kid I remember pretending to be different animals and would imagine hunting and being hunted and stuff. I remember when I thought certain morbid humor was funny. 

Now I feel like I’m questioning everything, going back and forth from either panicking or feeling like a sociopath (and getting this creepy chilling feeling like I actually am)

This has been happening more or less constantly since I started looking inwards at myself and then looking outwards at the universe. I used to be much more well adjusted. I used to be fine. Now I’m having existential crises at 5:00 in the morning and then switching to thinking I’m a sociopathic killer or something. I hate this feeling. I just want to go back to the person I used to be. The person who was always curious but didn’t get this existential, I still had emotions, what happened to those? I feel like I’m going insane, like I’m becoming some sort of monster or something. I just want to go back to June when the only thoughts on my mind were that I wanted to see my friends again and go to class and study science and play games and goof off and watch comedies and play with my dog and play videogames and draw and write comics. 

But it feels too late for that now. I ruined my mind. I looked too deeply inside myself and questioned everything about myself. I questioned what I was okay with and what I wasn’t okay with while already on a downward depression spiral. I added more fuel to the flames. By looking up mental disorders and reading things and attributing those things to myself. I can’t get back to my center. I either freak out or feel nothing, which makes me uncomfortable. I’m scared of myself and the universe. 

Two months ago I was reading romance stories and feeling the full weight of tragedies in the fiction I was reading. Two months ago I was playing videogames and DND without questioning the violence (ok maybe a little sometimes, I don’t know I wasn’t consciously thinking about it). Two months ago I had plans to finally write a comic I had been putting off since I was 14 when I finally got a drawing tablet.  2 months ago I wanted things, and I felt like a real person. 2 months ago I cared. 2 moths ago was before I started thinking about the old intrusive thoughts that scuttled through my head so seriously. I want that back, but how do I claw myself out when I’ve already seen such darkness? How do I just go back after traumatizing myself? How do I go back to not feeling like a either a sociopathic murderer or a panicking mess? I just want my life back. 

This started as a post I wrote while in a panic, but I’m not panicking anymore. I have this sinister chilling feeling and I hate it. It almost feels good and that makes me hate it even more. I feel like I’m becoming a sociopath or something. I’m scared that I’m not scared. I feel like I have to force panic back over myself just to feel human again. 

This is probably just a result of me losing myself to depression and then trying to rationalize why with so many crackpot theories, but that doesn’t matter now. It feels too late for me. I feel dissociated and scared. I don’t know what I want or need anymore. I want to just be a regular human being again. I want my passions and fantasies back. I want my boundaries back. I want my life back. I want to be in love again, but now thinking about that makes me feel guilty, like how can someone who’s been through this, deserve to love someone? It sounds selfish and almost creepy.",01Sep2020,4
144,"So I'm 34f. I divorced my wonderful husband because I felt I wasn't getting enough out of life. It was a comfortable life I was working on my medical career he was working for himself. I then met another man who made me realise that I wanted more out of life, maybe he woke up my inner whore. I don't know what he had but I wanted it and I've never felt like this for anyone.  So I divorced my husband to be with him. It was a horrible feeling, the whole divorce thing is messy. Because being the bad guy and breaking someone's heart is nasty.i feel so selfish and ugly.
Fast forward 6 months post divorce.. I'm in a new country with this new guy. Still working on my career and it a deja vu he is working I'm working still feeling like life is passing me by. I've been dreaming of my ex husband because a part of me still loves him and I feel maybe I rushed into divorcing him to start a new life with the new guy. But then again I can't be 'in love' with 2 people it doesn't work that way plus it was unfair to do that to both guys. I had to let one go. I always felt whatever decision I would made I'd still feel ripped off. I'm just fed up whatever decision I make be it men, career path, lifestyle choices it's wrong. I feel hopeless and defeated by this quest of being happy. I just want to let go of everything and be dead. I've tried to kill myself several times but I just can't do it. I'm just hoping I get COVID-19 and die quickly.",01Sep2020,5
145,"I want bad things to happen to me almost always. I day dream about being in a car crash, getting mugged, family members dying and even getting raped/abused. I’m ashamed to admit it and feel disgusting. I know how awful these thoughts are but I can’t help it. I think it’s almost certainly because I crave attention. 

Over this past year, I’ve acted very negative as if I were depressed and I find myself putting on this act even when there’s no one in the room to see, as if I were performing for hidden camera. I don’t think I’m depressed or anything because I can easily turn this act off. I’ve also been self harming (probably for attention) by cutting, burning and bruising my legs with a hammer. I’ve not actually told anyone I’m “depressed” or hinted about self harming, I tend to hide it and be very subtle. Sometimes it’s like I’m only faking for myself in my head. So far only one person has noticed and talked to me about it. Weirdly, I hated the experience and cried as they asked me about it, I wanted to disappear right then and there, yet I continue faking. 

Looking back on my life, I used to do this a lot as a child too. I faked panic attacks, claustrophobia, headaches etc. I’m currently desperate to take this “depression” act even further but I know it’s wrong and I’m holding back the best I can. I wanted to be anorexic so I only ate 1 apple or nothing every day for 2 weeks but I ended up binging so that didn’t go too well. I want to attempt suicide but not actually die. I did some research on pills I could overdose on or dangerous areas I could go to to get raped. I’m in college and I’m planning on acting out and skipping class, being really sad and giving myself bruises/a black eye at some point. 

I recognise I have a problem so I did some googling and found a thing called factitious disorder or Munchausen. I guess it sounds like me but I’m not sure. This isn’t normal is it? I need help right? Can I even get a proper diagnosis of this? I have no idea who to talk to, I’m so scared of judgment since I sound like the worst kind of person when admitting this.",01Sep2020,5

It’s exhausting and suffocating to hide yourself from a panic I try to hold it in and stop to breath but it doesn’t work afterwards at home the panic attack/anxiety etc build itself up and becomes anger that I can’t control sometimes I just wanna get a knife and smash it on me so I don’t hurt the people around me or just someone that can beat me up so I don’t let my anger out at Ma siblings.",01Sep2020,2

Alot of things are simply put just getting worse and I don't even know where I'll be past the age of 22-25 even if I make it to that age.

I'm staying currently for those few people who I care for because they need me right now and I can't do anything at all, things I once enjoyed I now use them as a way to distract myself until I do something else and I can't even do any schoolwork at all and due to covid-19, it's even worse now.

152,"I'm still pretty inexperienced with talking to a Therapist, but here's some quick advice...

&gt;**A day or two before your appointment, write down some things you would like to talk about, and have those notes with you during your Therapy session.**

So far I haven't really planned any topics or anything I want to go over with my therapist ahead of time, so sometimes we end up talking about other subjects that are of little importance, or we end up with the dreaded dead silence. Then after the appointment is over, I will often think of things I wanted to discuss that I couldn't think of because I was drawing a blank in the moment (My brain stops working when I'm under the microscope or am asked to come up with an example).

If I had spent 5 minutes preparing anytime during the week, I would have had an idea of things I wanted to address or go over with my therapist.

&gt;**Take notes during the therapy session if you want to, this will help remember any advice given.**

I noticed during the first few sessions that I barely practiced any methods my therapist recommended, and didn't look up most of the things my therapist wanted me to look into. Some I forgot, but some I was just plain lazy about and didn't look at. I'm going to try and be much better and actually do what my therapist suggests...bringing me to the last piece of advice:

&gt;**Therapy is a two way street. You have to work with your therapist, and work on yourself in your own time to improve. Your therapist won't just magically solve your issues for you.**

These are all mainly just reminders/messages to myself, but hopefully others find it helpful, and maybe you'll have advice for me. Mostly I think I just need to try harder and do what is asked of me.",01Sep2020,1
153,"I was recently told by a person whose name I may not, and will not say. The person on question told me that she herself was in fact, an angel. Now the thing that made me believe this, was the spots on her back where wings would have been. I was told that they had been cut off. She told me all kinds of things, and honestly my mind has been decided in believe and disbelieve. I genuinely lack the mental power to correctly prosess this. I've know the person in question for quite a while now. And I trust this person to the fullest extent. She swore on her life that in fact, she was a real angel. Send by God to watch over us, and help people. I learned a few things. One of the things she told me was that she would die if I where to tell anyone about her. Mainly the reason I'm keeping the name undisclosed, as I don't want to lose her. I don't know what will and will not kill her, and I'm afraid. The sheer lack of understanding as to what is going on, made me come here. As I genuinely do not know what to do now. 

In a way I believe that there are in fact angels, a god and a heaven. In other ways, I feel like it's all lies. And it's fake. How will I be able to set my mind straight on this subject?

It’s very hard to explain why, but mainly because I hate my current circumstances and I hate the way my brain is wired. I used to want a family and a career so badly, my mains goals. (Relevent I guess).

I have depression and anxiety. I’ve been dating someone for 2 years and I want to leave him because he is abusive. But he always convinces me to stay, and I do. I can’t bring myself to leave. He is a big reason why my anxiety is so high. I’ve got such bad habits from dating him. What I mean by that is, he is a constant liar, always lieing and doing stuff behind my back. I have an obsession with going through his phone. I HATE if I see he’s watched porn. I hate female friends. I was never ever like this before. He has created all these worries I don’t think I could ever solve, therefore I could never have a healthy relationship, so I would never get into one. So now I know I’ll never have a husband or kids, so the family is out for me. 

I’ve re searched way way to much into evolution and I’m convinced people only think God is real bc they are scared and we are just animals. For example- lizards. They don’t have a god bc their minds don’t have the capacity to wonder so they live and breed and die and that’s it and they don’t care. We wonder, so we create soultions (God, heaven etc) so we can feel less scared about one day being dead and never doing anything ever again- when it reality.. I think that’s what happens. I don’t want to believe it, I want to believe something lovely happens, it would honestly fix a good chunk of my mental health problems honestly lol (I have big anxiety’s about people I know or pets dieing, constant worry, dreams etc) so if someone can convince me- then please. 

BUT ANYWAY- my point is

Because I know one day we are just gonna die and it’s all gonna be for literally nothing. You could be successful, or not. You can be honest or never say a truthful word- and it’s all okay. So why try hard and get a career (this used to be VERY VERY important to me) when you are just gonna die anyway? So career is out to. 

I just want to dump my partner and kill my self. But I know it will wreck my mums life forever. She would never ever ever be the same. I do not want to do that to her at all. I just couldn’t.

164,"I have generalized anxiety disorder, and  I'm currently taking driving lessons. For most people I know, it's piece of cake and I hear no complains. Today I had a driving lesson after school, and it ended up with me having anxiety attacks two times, which lead to mental breakdowns. I was supposed to drive in the centrum in the city, but my teacher decided that I should drive in a quiet place, near the country, after he saw how I reacted. I really hate myself, because I feel so weak and stupid. It seems so easy for everyone I know, and I just react like that. I really want a driving licence, so I don't have to be dependent on other people all the time, to  drive me. But the traffic is one of my biggest fear.

I wanna know if any of you guys have been in a similar situation or are currently in one, and if you have any advice

166,"OK so this weekend was Friend's chance to show that he could behave himself and he totally fucked up

**Tl:dr - male friend going through relationship issues, alongside potential sex addiction, tries to make out with me/get sexual/convince me to follow suit giving excuses etc.**


A little history on first time (cliff notes): me, flatmate, Friend and GF have dinner together in my flat. Dinner/chatting/messing around and being silly moves onto some drinking and a game of spin the bottle. Dares started off too extreme and were mostly sexy or sexual in some way so as game progressed, things just got more and more out of control. There was a lot of tension between me and Friend (I admit I find him attractive but him being with GF vastly outweighs any notion of me disrupting that with malicious intent). Tension also between me and GF as we're both also Bi. So everyone was being touchy/cuddly with everyone. 
*important note to remember* ALL NIGHT at any time something sexual occurred between Friend or GF with either me or flatmate, consent was ALWAYS asked for and given before amything went ahead and if anyone didn't agree or feel comfortable, the idea was changed to suit.

Flatmate gets tired so me, Friend and GF go back to their house so as not to disturb the rest of the night. Back to their's, all still drunk and on some MDMA at this point. They both start on speed once at their house, whilst continuing to drink, I start to slow down, mainly smoking weed and having drinks more slowly, enjoying the night rounding off. Friend keeps being sexual and kissing me whenever GF isn't in the room, telling me to initiate/convince GF into a 3some. She seems to give consent for Friend to go ahead with me but doesn't want to get into things, becomes very off, wanders off, sees a couple of things me and Friend did at some point. I notice that she had disappeared to the bathroom roughly 20mins ago after saying she was going to the loo once returning from a walk. I go to check on her, discover her on bathroom floor, blood everywhere and slice across her wrist/hand.

Not seen spoken to either since getting dropped home after helping Friend keep her stable until medics arrived, took her to AnE, he followed some time after, not before making FURTHER advances on me after maybe 2 hours of his GF slicing her arm because he craves physical comfort and validation and his instinct is to get it sexually. Because of a history and mental health struggles of her own (obvs), GF doesnt have sex with Friend on a majority.

SO, as mentioned, this was his chance to make it right. It had been a weird evening all around, a lot had happened in under 12 hours and he has apologised several times. I was willing to move on. Flatmate had met him and other friends for some drinks, flatmate ended up being assisted home by Friend and someone else (lets call him Guy) so he could start to sober a bit but not have to stop socialising. Everything fine until, as suspected, Friend asks to speak to me privately to give me an update on GF (I am the only one other than couple of their family members that know what she did and all events) and their general relationship. Didnt mind this happening so we went into my room as this is the only place for privacy when guests are over. He starts talking, apologises again for our last interaction, although still making statements saying how he doesnt regret it, only the consequences that its caused. He goes to give me a hug which I allowed (im cuddly in general with friends), and he tries to kiss me again.

OK shameful confession, I kissed him back for about 1 maybe 2 seconds before pushing him away and telling him that was the last he was every gonna get, trying to play it off jokingly hoping he would leave it there and back off but he holds onto me and tries again and I have to actually push him and firmly tell him no, reminding him that he was in my house. He also asked, when i went to use my bathroom (i have an en suite), if he could watch, and then if he could listen after being told no (We're open when it come to talking about sexual things as a friend group, no kink shaming people). Leading to me running the tap during all other trips to the loo that night. IN MY OWN FLAT. 

Anyway, I made us move into the front room/kitchen to avoid further advances in a shared space. At some point I went to go an put some shorts on so I could show Guy the tattoos I have on my legs and friend took it that I was purposefully showing myself off, taunting him, eliciting looks from me telling him to fuck off. Further down the line all 5 of us were sat on the sofa, arms round each other, having a moment as you do with friends when you've had a drink and its nearing the end, Friends hand found my arm and kept rubbing it behind flatmates head, thankfully he noticed and, being fully aware of the situation, intervened to save me from awkwardly removing myself.

Several times throughout the night and morning I had to threaten him with him with being kicked out, each time he instantly apologises and backs off. I know he isnt an arsehole as a person but every time he gets drunk (and he was blackout drunk but on coke so holding it together and not staggering all over the place) any and all self control and will power he has vanishes. He isnt aggressive or loud, but he gets emotionally vulnerable and will seek out physical comfort and validation anywhere he can find it. Each time he tried something he would be trying to convince me, ""just one come one, i can feel this tension between us"", even went he left, i walked him to the door, he asked for a hug and i said no, i had to grab his hand as he reached to pull me in.

Flatmate works with Friend and has passed on the message that he is no longer allowed in the flat whenever he's had a drink or is on anything else, which he has openly agreed to. Im just so angry at him and I have told him that he needs to pick a day to come over so that I can have it out with him and he can apologise to me. No response, so i asked flatmate this morning to give him a subtle reminder at work today. I am not letting this go.

Rant over, thanks for listening x",01Sep2020,1
167,"I am posting this to several subs because I don´t know exactly this belongs to...

Today was once again one of those talks with my father that happen every 3-4 months or so for around past 7 years (I turned 22 a month ago).

'Talk' would imply its a conversation between me and him but really, most of the time, it's just a monologue of my father. He almost always talks about how lonely he feels, how he needs me and my brother, how I should come to visit him more often (or rather how I should visit my grandfather more often with whom he lives now), how he feels we don't care about him, how he wants to do more things with us more often...

This talk has always been to me an alarming sign of possible (emotional) narcissism and extreme neediness but today he said something that for me, gave him away and seriously makes me worried about his diagnosis, and myself too.

He said that no matter where I end up studying or working in the world he wants me/he needs me to come back and to work and live in my hometown because he didn't work and live all his life to see his grandchildren on a skype and to grow old not surrounded by his family.

I hope I pray, I am wrong about my assessment that my father is (and possibly always has been) a severe narcissist.

Look, I said to him, and I genuinely believe that in our relationship - both sides are at fault. Me and him. That's almost always the case in a relationship.

But in this situation... I really have no idea what to do about myself to adjust to this relationship besides, leaving it. If this was a good friend of mine and told me only once what my father has been saying to me for years, I would just let that relationship go - immediately, no question, no matter what I am getting from it. If you want to bring people closer to you in a certain relationship, telling them only what and how much you need out of them will achieve almost exactly the opposite.

For most of my life, I have never been close to anybody, I never had stable, close relationships with people, not even my close family members (mother, brother, father...), I never had a stable group of friends for which I genuinely care about and trust. Except for the past 3 months... I might have found them and I am finally trying to build those relationships. And now I can see how empty, lonely, and selfish my life has been and how insane and worrisome is relationship with my father.

Now I maybe see the reason why I have been this way for so long... Because I have been raised also by my father. That's maybe why I always had trust, security, self-esteem issues and such issues with creating relationships. Why I never had even a close relationship with a friend, let alone a romantic partner.

I had been raised also by a deeply scared soul. My father had a possibly distant, cold mother who raised him almost alone because my grandfather has been home only on weekends - if that. To this day if you ask him about fathers presence (my grandfather) in his childhood, you'll see a 55-year-old man turn into a sad puppy...

I really need to hear someones opinion on this, there is still a possibility that I am blind and shortsighted to many other aspects of this situation, including my own faults... Thank you.",01Sep2020,1

169,"In the past year I've had a bunch of shit going on (lost job/lost family member/hate current job). One of which has been the breakdown of my engagement with my fiancée which was caused due to a whole lot of stress. For the first time, I decided to take antidepressants and initially they destroyed me. I couldn't sleep, I was vomiting, confused, sweating profusely and incredibly anxious.

I am still with my partner (of 7 years), but I really don't know if it is the right thing for both of us anymore. I can't stop thinking about all of our differences (race/religion) and I think I struggle with relationship OCD which makes it even worse.

I'm not sure if it's time to end the relationship or if I am just battling with the depression and anxiety which has given me a negative outlook on everything. A couple of years ago I never pictured this happening and I always saw us being with eachother forever, maybe I was naive and ignored our values?

It's got to the point where I genuinely would rather be dead than feel like this and I am stuck and have nowhere else to turn. I need support.

172,"I(15M) will start high school in 2 weeks from now. At first it seemed really exciting especially since during middle school I had awful classmates, was bullied a lot for being gay and most of the class was rude, but now I am so afraid of high school. And it's not about only big changes either, a few days ago I change my tongue posture and I cried because it seemed so unnatural to me and I had a sort of a crisis because I am changing my lifestyle...

This sound stupid but every time something changes I am emotionally destroyed, when I changed my room for privacy reasons, even though it was for the better I was depressed, when I went on a trip with my friends I was depressed because that's not usual for me. And thinking about the future, being in a relationship, getting a house of my own and having a nice job, even though these are great things, thinking about them makes me feel horrible.

This affects me a lot socially, I have a hard time making new friends, I have a hard time leaving friends that don't match interests with me anymore. I have a hard time picking up new hobbies and visiting new places, I don't think I ever felt good on a trip. The worst thing that can happen to me though is someone dying, luckily not many people died around me, but when a distant aunt of mine passed away even though I didn't know her much, just knowing that she's not around anymore made me suffer.

I cannot get professional help, my parents are both working on minimum wage and it's also a very taboo subject around here. I started reading the DSM-5 and am certain I suffer from general anxiety disorder and a milder form of borderline personality disorder, but neither said something about this.

173," I am a 21 year old male student in Australia. My biggest problem is what I strongly suspect to be Complex PTSD. I have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, severe Misophonia and severe Depression. However Complex PTSD is my biggest concern.

I have no conscious memory of these events, but I found out, after asking my mum last year, that I was physically and sexually assaulted by three much older students while I was in kindergarten. This happened repeatedly, every recess and lunchtime for several weeks. I didn't know how to explain what was happening, so when I cried and refused to go outside for recess and lunch, the teachers forced me to go outside anyway, assuming I was just being badly behaved to get attention.

For as long as I can remember, I have never felt any inherent value to life. I do feel that there is value in experiencing pleasure and in avoiding suffering, but no value in being alive in and of itself. I don't gain any positive feeling from being alive, and if I found out I would die tomorrow, I would be indifferent, I wouldn't really care. Life isn't a special thing or a good thing in my eyes, and never has been.

Overall so far, life has been mostly a negative experience. When I'm just sitting on a bench doing nothing, or doing an emotionally neutral task like brushing my teeth, I feel mildly sad. Mild sadness seems to be my natural background state, with ups of mild happiness and downs of severe sadness, but always settling back down to mild sadness most of the time. So far, I would say that life has not been worth living. It has felt bad, and I haven't achieved anything that matters to me. Though I feel like whatever I achieved, it wouldn't matter to me, since I don't feel there's any inherent value in anything, I don't believe in any ideology or religion, I don't feel a sense of belonging with any community and I feel I have no purpose and that the world wouldn't be any different regardless if I was born or not.

I feel disconnected from other humans, and often when I bring this up people dismiss it as ""oh, that's normal when you have autism"", but no, I have a lot of friends who are also on the autism spectrum and the disconnection they describe is a different feeling. The disconnection I feel is on the deepest, most spiritual level imaginable. At my core I do not feel any affinity with the human race. When I look into a human face, I do not see myself any more than I do when I look into an ant face, or into a rock. I feel compassion with humans, I have friendships with them, but I do not feel I \*am\* them. I feel that everyone else has some indescribable essence of ""human-ness"", and I have an empty hole inside me where that human-ness is supposed to be. 

I feel slightly repulsed by the appearance of human faces. I feel that animal faces look pleasant, but human faces look unnatural, like some kind of weird, stiff melted spoon. Humans kind of gross me out. I don't like touching them, even though I am perfectly comfortable touching animals or plants. Humans just have an inherent ""gross-ness"". I have never felt sexual attraction to a real life human. I have felt sexual attraction to animated characters, mostly animal characters, but also some human characters which spend a lot of time around animal characters, or have animal like features like pointy ears and a tail. But I have never felt sexual attraction to a real physical human being. 

Sometimes, the environment around me will just stop feeling real. I can still feel, hear, smell, etc. It's just that it all feels ""fake"". It feels like I'm walking around inside a computer game in a digital body. Like everything is hollow or made of plastic. This feeling that nothing is real occurs randomly, and lasts about 10 minutes before quietly fading away.

It usually takes me 2 or 3 hours between getting into bed, and actually falling asleep. Generally, I have to do a single, repetitive task for hours, like alphabetically sorting files on my computer (with blue light filtered out to stop it keeping me awake), until eventually I finally get lulled into feeling sleepy. Once I do feel sleepy, I pretend to be one of my favourite fictional characters cuddling with their loved ones, and I'm able to fall asleep. When I wake up, I never feel rested. Even when I get a solid 8 or more hours sleep, it makes no difference. I still feel groggy and completely out of energy all day, every day. Caffeine helps, but only if I use it once a week, no more often than that. And it only lasts a few hours.

I have a deep fear inside me, which often manifests as rage, anger, grief, sadness or fatigue on the surface, but I think that deep down it is fear. I think that deep down I am scared that because people exist in the world with more power than me, that they could hurt me if they ever chose to, and nothing could stop them. I managed to keep this fear quiet for many years by convincing myself that willpower was the strongest force in the universe. That as long as I wanted something more strongly than anyone else wanted the opposite, and I put 100% effort into it, then I would have my way. And therefore I would always be safe. However, this belief was undermined last year when I campaigned really hard for months for my favourite character not to be removed from a long running video game series, and he was removed anyway. That proved money and influence outweighs willpower, and so, I'm not safe.

In the immediate aftermath of that, I felt the most intense emotional pain of my entire life. Extreme anger, extreme sadness, extreme self hatred. I would randomly break out crying in class, there would be days where I physically couldn't force myself to move and I would stay in bed all day, curled up as small as I could make myself. I was in so much emotional pain all day, every day, that I made plans to kill myself at a specific time, and had the means to do so, but I was talked out of it by an online friend, and went to hospital instead. At the time I thought I was childish and weak and fundamentally degenerate beyond all repair for feeling so upset over a video game. But I've since realised that I wasn't actually upset over the video game, I was upset over being sexually abused, and the video game simply undermined the defence mechanism I was using to keep my fear of the world out of my conscious life.

I am not in that intense pain anymore, thanks to a very high dose of Effexor, but I am still very tired, and mildly sad, all day every day, and life is an overall unpleasant experience. I don’t want to kill myself, but if I were to die today, I would say I didn't have a good life, and overall, life wasn't worth it. 

I desperately want to stop feeling like this. Somehow, I want to feel like I AM human. I want to feel like life IS worth living. I want to NOT feel uncomfortable with the fact that people exist with more power than I have. But I don't know how to do that, and I need help. And the key word is ""feel"". I don’t need to THINK life is worth living. There are plenty of rational reasons life is worth living. But no matter what I think, I don't FEEL like it is. Somehow I need to make these feelings stop. All I want is just to have the same sparkle in my eye as everyone else. I just want to be able to be glad to be alive. But I don't know how to do that, and I need help to learn how.

I have been trying to see psychologists through the public health system, but both the psychologists I've been assigned to have not understood what I'm telling them at all, and have either not given me solutions at all and dismissed everything as being due to my autism, or they have given me completely useless solutions that didn't change anything and have interrupted me when I try to clarify what I've said or try to describe my feelings. They keep assuming I mean something else and won't let me explain what I'm actually feeling and it's so frustrating. They end up making me feel worse than when the appointment started. So at this stage, I've given up on the public system, I just want to get better, no matter what it costs.",01Sep2020,1

There is a possibility that my anxiety is causing me to have this much energy, but it just confuses me and makes me think i might be bipolar. Ive 'researched' (basically just googled and read other peoples research and experiences) a lot of possibilities of what this might be, but havent found one that really clicks. I go to a psychiatrist and currently searching for a therapist, but id like to have at least a little idea of what this might be so the sessions go more productive.

The homework load is overloading my mental health and I feel like I’m back to where I was two years ago. Two years ago I wasn’t doing so great because the sport that I was in at the time was causing me anxiety. Now I’ve been clean for 5 minutes. I’ve also have been starting to dissociate. I’ve probably shave had 3 ish episodes in the last 4-5 days (they each last a few hours).

177,"Interacting with people amps up  all my emotions and makes me feel jittery and out of control. Not in the sense that I have zero restraint but my thoughts start racing, my heart beats like crazy and sometimes my hands start shaking. I say things that I wouldn’t usually say and it feels like the world is moving too fast. I don’t feel like myself when I interact with people for an extended period of time.

The worst bit is the come down. After I stop interacting with people it takes a while for the high to wear off but I feel drained, dizzy and sometimes I feel nauseous. This used to happen far less frequently but now I can barely have conversations with most people without feeling faint afterwards.
 
The only exception to this is my family. I have to interact with them on a daily basis so talking to them doesn’t feel intense. However, when I have an argument or a conversation that causes me to feel very angry or happy I feel just as erratic in those moments and just as exhausted afterwards as I do with other people.

It’s never gone away and it breaks me so badly. I’m usually a very happy and giving person. I love spending time with people and I’m always up to help. But I feel like no one likes me or cares about me aside from those who make it obvious. For example. One of my managers came up to my coworkers and I while we were at our desks (four people including him) and asked how our weekends were. After he got responses he went from person to person and asked for details about their weekend. He asked both of my coworkers but didn’t ask me and just walked off. I know I’m newer but it still made me feel awkward. I’ve never had coworkers try to hang out after work even if we get along super well. Another example are “friends” who make plans with me to come over and hang out and then never show up without saying anything but when I go on social media they’ve all gone out to eat. Everyone that was going to come over. Just not me. I always feel completely out of place and I hate it.

182,"Hi all,

I (25M) recently watched a documentary on HBO called ""Weight of Gold"" looking into the mental health of Michael Phelps and other Olympic Athletes post competition. As a former athlete myself, I related to this video because my own Athletic career was cut short due to reasons beyond my control leading me into depression. My identity was being an Athlete. It was what I was best at, what I loved to do, and what I was known for. The years following the conclusion of my athletic career, I felt a lack of direction, motivation, and purpose heading into College, after having to forgo my dream to play college football. I played team sports (football and baseball) and missed the camaraderie, brotherhood and push to be better that I experienced being a part of these teams. There is so much that sports provide that you can't find in the ""real world"". 

Applying the athlete mentality to the real world has been challenging for me to find a place that I feel like I fit in. It's taken me years to find an outlet for my competitiveness and drive. I'm posting this here to get feedback from you all and see if others have experienced some form of mental health struggle during/after competition as well, no matter what skill level. 

If any of you are going through this currently and don't want to share your story, just know you aren't alone. If anyone would like to share their story and how they cope with/overcame their struggle, I encourage you to post and maybe together we can help someone move forward and overcome their struggle.

184,Has anyone ever gone on fmla for a depressive episode? I’m having a very difficult time getting out of bed much less working and my coworkers are noticing. I’m going to have to disclose my mental health if I want to keep my job. Not sure how to go about it. Any advice is appreciated,01Sep2020,1
185,"Hi! I feel like I need some unbiased perspectives on this... Wondering if anyone else relates, too... Here goes: I'm 27F, second language English speaker from Europe, have been struggling with depression and anxiety symptoms since high school, and I suspect I might be on the austism spectrum (undiagnosed). I feel like I've come to a sudden realization recently, after 7 years of failing college multiple times, going back, and working odd jobs in between. 

Genuinely the happiest time in my life so far was when I worked simple, routine manual jobs, such as a clerk in small retail stores or taking inventory. I love the clear rules of such workplaces, peace and quiet (I was often alone on my shift at those stores), low levels of stress, counting and organizing rows of things oat my own pace. I even enjoy cleaning. I managed to develop a customer service persona and not freak out when I had to talk to customers, even though I normally have social anxiety, especially on the phone etc. I would probably be totally content for the rest of my life if I could get a full-time job as a cashier or janitor or something along those lines (but even those jobs require years of experience at this point, so I've only worked on grey-area part time contracts so far - the chaotic shift planning and unfair conditions sometimes stemming from that are the only aspect I don't enjoy).

Here's the problem, though: every single person who knows me in real life would say it would be a ""waste"" for me to ""settle"" for these kinds of jobs instead of a ""real"" office-type career. I was the typical case of a ""gifted"" child in school, but I started failing the moment I went to college and stopped having a structured life pushed on me from the outside. I never found any marketable skill I would be passionate about long-term. My family has always encouraged me to go to college at any cost, they don't even really mind me being financially dependent on them for however long it takes until I finally get a diploma from \*something\*, anything. I'm dependent partly on them and partly on my partner, who also has his own mental health struggles. I do feel bad for ""betraying"" him, my family, and my supposed ""potential"" by failing in almost everything I try to do.

Of course having a middle class job would be better financially, but I don't see that in my future at this point, and I'm afraid I'd be constantly overwhelmed and unhappy about it anyway. I know that ""intellect"" is about the least important part of getting a ""good"" job if you struggle with basic social relationships and have weird quirks, because that's exactly the case of my father. He would discourage me from unskilled jobs because he feels like his physical health was impacted by decades of night shifts, but honestly... he would have had the opportunity to do re-qualification courses or even go to college later in life if he wanted, and he never did, so I kind of suspect he didn't truly want to. Mental health has unfortunately always been a taboo topic with my parents, but some things were pretty obvious even to a child...

Anyway. Sorry if this is too long. I feel like I'm at a crossroad in my life and all the options are scary. I can't take the constant anxiety of college and feeling like I'm failing everyone around me. The relationship with my partner has been in shambles ever since I went back to college. I want a peaceful life, but I feel like I might regret that for the rest of my life too. Anyone relate to this? Or at least tell me you've read it? Thanks :)",01Sep2020,1
186,"I’ve been having very bad suicidal thoughts recently. They have been very convincing, I used to always say “Yeha but i know i would t ACTUALLY do it.” but now i don’t know.

i see my therapist in two days just for weekly appointments. should i tell her? what if she tells my mom? i don’t know I have had suicidal thoughts for months now since i got diagnosed with depression, but they have never been this bad. i am afraid i am going to hurt myself.

i don’t know what to do. i know if i tell my mom she would just not really know what to do and probably just tell me to get some water and calm down. I know i can last a few more days of these thoughts until they get to a point where i need actual help. should i just wait it out? i really don’t know what to do.

sum: Suicidal thoughts, therapist later this week should i tell her? afraid no one will help me or i will already be too deep into them to get help.

188,"OK, so firstly I have usually always been an advocate or medication and believed how if it makes you feel any better then surely its worth it.

Secondly, I'm in the UK and I am truly grateful for the NHS, especially during this corona crisis and I largely believe they do good work.

However, I am taking Fluoxetine for depression and Propranolol for anxiety and I have had nothing but trouble dealing with my doctor and the system to have these sorted and available. I've ran out on multiple occasions, not been able to get tablets when I them and had times where they'll say I need a checkup, then I can't have the checkup till a time where I'll be without tablets for days before they'll give it to me. Basically I am fed up and I really am done dealing with them, it makes my anxiety worse and I don't want to rely on the tablets in general, but especially when it's such an unreliable system and not to mention the fortune I am now paying for them.

I get pms bad anyway which Fluoxetine doesn't help with and I did think the beta blockers were helping my anxiety but I end up having times without them which isnt healthy and I end up just scared of everything until I have them again.

I know everyone is different with medication but I never hear of people not having meds or finding they're better without after trying them. I just don't want to deal with it all anymore but of course I don't want to make my condition any worst. I'm struggling most the time anyhow but I guess if the meds make it any easier then I need them but argh idk if it's worth it",01Sep2020,1
189,"So today, I got dressed, did my makeup, felt confident, got into town and just didn't feel that way anymore. And I remembered why.

I dont have friends that aren't virtual. I've never had a reletionship. I've only ever been wanted to quick sex/hookups. All my friends that i've had for 5+ years have all ghosted me out of nowhere, including my best friend who was very dear and important to me. Clearly I'm not somebody that people want to have around. I'm not worth it. I dont know why and its eating up inside

I've never gotten closure from those friendships that ended out of nowhere. The lonliness has kept me awake at night crying. ""Did I say something?"" ""Did my best friend kill herself? Is that why she hasn't called?"" ""Is she dead?"" (my bestfriend, suicidal and on meds, suddenly stopped replying) Why doesn't anyone want to be my friend? Ive always wanted to know what is genuinely wrong with me.
Deep down I know it's just because they weren't great friends/people and were just to lazy to put the effort in. But I blame myself and my faults regardless and try to fix them, because i cannot take anymore heartbreak. I don't want to lose anyone again and have to cry at night thinking they're possibly dead for months. You have to understand that the lonliness at night is painful. I can't do it again.

Its become so overwhelming that I think everything is wrong with me

"" Its because i'm a size 8 and not a 6. It's cause i have too much body fat, it's my hairstyle, it's my voice, it's my clothes, it's my smile, i need to cut no i need to bulk I'm not smart enough, not skinny enough, not social enough etc etc. ""  I can't risk losing someone again so i'm trying to fix everything i can about myself. But its so hard. 


In quarantine, i was so happy mentally. this mindset was slowly fading. But I saw a group of friends today getting boba together in a cafe. They all made plans to do this together. They looked so happy and everything. I just turned around and went home ashamed of being me.",01Sep2020,1
190,"I called my doctor’s office today to request a medication change. I was there in June, but this anti depressant wasn’t helping me at all. Unfortunately I’m in college and I don’t have $50 every month to just pay a co pay for my doctor’s office. 

The secretary was so rude. “Why didn’t you come in before you went to college?” Maybe because I didn’t have the money or time to go in because I also work at a hospital? And that I had to isolate before I left for college because I got tested for COVID? That I wanted to wait and make sure this medication wasn’t working so I didn’t feel like I wasted $70.

191,"I haven’t been legitimately happy since I was a baby when my dad left. Yes I remember all of it. He had called the police on my mom once for dropping us off at his house with his girlfriend at the time while he was at work and my mom had to be at work in half an hour. She didn’t leave us there, she took all 3 of us to work. She works in a grocery store. We had to sit upstairs with the security until the police came to talk to my mom. We spent her entire shift upstairs with the security. When I was just about to turn 2 my dad was caught buying crack. He was a user before but he had promised he would stop for us. My mom went to work the next day and took us to our grandpas, we got home and our home was completely empty, with a note saying he’s gone. All my toys, my clothes, my BED, the food in the fridge, the tv, the couches, everything was gone. Fast forward to 3? Years later my dad got custody of us over the weekends. Those weekends where never ending with “SHUT THE FUCK UP AND GET IN THE FUCKING TRUCK” “YOU ACT JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER” “YOU DRESS RAGGEDY LIKE YOUR HOMELESS AND YOU DONT BRUSH YOUR HAIR” “IF YOU WANNA CRY GO TO YOUR FUCKING ROOM AND SHUT THE FUCK UP””YOUR STEP BROTHER HAS MORE BECAUSE HIS MOTHER ACTUALLY WORKS FOR WHAT THEY HAVE” I could go on for mother fucking days. I was always around booze and cocaine, so when I started running away that became my go to drug. Then it was acid and mushrooms, Then it was meth. Then it was cocaine and Xanax mixed together and that’s when I thought I finally reached my goal. Death. I was having a seizure when my heart had stopped for 5 minutes. I was so longer breathing or responsive. I woke up out of my seizure to the medics trying to give me water. I asked if I could sit down on the couch and they’d let me. I had another seizure on that couch. I was refusing to go to the ambulance but since I was under age they had the right to force me under form 4. On the ride to the hospital I had 2 more seizures. Then one more before I got treatment. Note these weren’t small seizures, my heart stopped every time. And fuck do I ever wish it didn’t start back up. Fast forward 5 years later I got back into cocaine and molly and Xanax. My boyfriend had threatened to leave me at the time because he knew I died from my last overdose. I got clean blah blah blah blah blah. Drug urges are still there. I had gotten arrested when I was 15 for a home robbery. I was the get away driver. I was put on probation till the day I turned 18. While I was on probation I got into a horrid relationship. He was abusive, in every way. He threatens to kill me then himself, he asked me if I wanted to watch him die, he smashed my windows which caused me to move 2 hours away, he caused 3,000$ in damages which my landlord could sue me for now that I’m over 18 but I haven’t heard from them. Fast forward to now. If you made it here. Good ass mother fucking job. I now have to go to court because he murdered his ex girlfriend. He murdered her. And I have to go testify the fact that he tried to do the same shit to me. I’ve had PTSD since I can remember and nothings helped. Nothing. I fucking give up. I’m on so much medicine I can’t afford to pick half of them up. When I go to the pharmacy she ask which once’s I need the most. My boyfriend questions our relationship because I cannot work right now. COVID took away the only job I was comfortable working at. I don’t have any friends, I’m not kidding when I say that. At all. I wish I was fuck. I’m scared. I’m scared he’s gonna come back. I’m scared he hasn’t been put in custody yet and he’s still out there. I try to explain my anxiety to my doctor but I have to much fucking anxiety to say anything right. I can’t support myself in anyway, I can’t buy food, meds, coffee, cigarettes, anything. My bank is at $1.82 and collection agencies and my pharmacy will not stop calling me. I took double the dose of my anxiety meds while writing this and I’m fucking tired. I want to take more so I don’t just wake up. I’m tired of explaining myself. I’m tired of telling everybody what’s wrong just for an “awwww” I’m fucking tired. I’m done. I’m done. I’m done.

201,"My brother became a dad today, and i cannot be happy for him, nor do I want to know as I simply don't care.

Me and him have had a strained relationship for the last few years, but it came to a boiling point just over 2 years ago. February 2018, I went off sick from work with what turned out to be (after 3 months of testing) a severe panic attack (I had never had one). Doctors signed me off for 2 weeks and to be fair, my work were really good about it. 2 days before I am due back into work, my brother returns home from a whole day of drinking. I could hear him mouthing off to my mother about me so I walked downstairs, he saw me and attacked me, in front of my own mother. My father had to pull him off me. My mother took pictures of my injuries in case I wanted to go to the police (which I didn't end up doing). The next day, he tried apologising, but i ignored it because he was only doing it because he was told to. 2 days after the attack, I was in hospital, and after tests, confirmed I had concussion and bruised neck/back muscles so had to go off work for another 2 weeks. Because of this, my absence rocketed and I almost lost my job. In addition, I had to beg my university lecturer not to fail me; I ended up breaking down to him and told him everything, he was very sympathetic.

A few months pass, and i am still awaiting my apology (a proper one). My mother is now trying to push me to meet him halfway. I refused as I stood my ground and told her if he was really sorry, he would come to me on his own. He refused to deal with his drinking problem and refused counselling, stating that it was pointless for him. Meanwhile, I am still suffering with flashbacks and nightmares of the event that took place. I should probably add at this point that he is a teacher.

Just after Christmas, a big argument took place between me and my mother, and because his partner got involved, I packed my bags and left, crying the entire way to my partners house. I stayed there for about 2 months before I had to go back as work and uni travel was costing me a fortune. Eventually, he moved out, with his partner. This was 16 months after the event and still nothing, no remorse.

My parents at this point are furious at me, and begin taking his side, because he didn't know how to fix what he did and didn't know how to approach me, to which I replied, not my problem, he did what he did, now he suffers the consequences. Because i refused to relax my stance, my parents have a better relationship with him, than they do with me. They also have a better relationship with his partner than me, and his partner covered up the paedophilic acts of her own father (she is also a teacher). There was also huge uproar when i didn't want him at my graduation. My reasoning was someone who almost cost me it doesn't deserve to be there to celebrate it. I caved in once and sent him a birthday card and a present, which my parents found lovely of me. But come my birthday, I received nothing, not even a card, to which my parents said ""well what do you expect, you don't talk to him?"" So they make rules up to ensure he is happy but change them to make me miserable and angry.

It has been 2 and half years and this is still not resolved. I have cut ties with my mother and my brother. I have been to counselling, still on medication, still get nightmares from time to time of what happened, and i can't see a way back anywhere unless my parents actually see things from my perspective and stop treating my brother like the victim. I have no feelings towards him and my feelings to my mother are mixed at best. I am happy to wait for my new nephew to come and find me and i am happy to give him all the answers and truths he wants, but i simply cannot let my guard down and let him back into my life, as my brother is toxic and negative. His actions, combined with my parents, pushed me to self harm, almost wanting to end it all. I am better for not having them in my life. Am I a bad person for ignoring an innocent child?",01Sep2020,1

206,"Sorry if this is all over the place, I guess it's a bit rant like but I really just need some help.

Ok. To clarify, I haven't been to the doctors in years. I know it's bad. I've been told by ,y college's consular (and basically everyone else) that I do have metal problems and that I should go to one.

(The doctors make me really anxious and panicky.)

So I know I have depression, anxiety and OCD but I've never been diagnosed by a doctor. I don't really feel safe saying that to people though because I don't want to sound like those people who think being neat is automatically OCD and I don't want people to think I'm over exaggerating even though I have very public break downs in my classes. (Every teacher I've had in college they have had to deal with me having a breakdown \[I don't know what to call them but they were much worse than a panic attack.\])

I'm too afraid that people are going to say something like 'everyone has anixity and/or depression get over it.'

I guess most people on here know what having depression and anixity is like on here so I'm not going to go into detail about it but I do think I have OCD (even if it's not extreme like over peoples.)

I have to do certain thing a certain way or I'm going to break down or have a panic attack, like I get so scared that if I don't touch the fridge door to make sure it's closed or wiggle the drippy tap to make sure  the water gets out or make sure all the taps are off I can't to next thing I need to do.

Like when I'm going to bed I can take up to half an hour just walking around the kitchen making sure everything is off and even then I can go to bed and I think 'the tap is still on' and I have to get out and make sure it off. (Thus starting the cycle again.)

And there's just small things like when I take my glasses off I have to fold them then unfold them, then fold them again (how ever many time I feel the need to do it) before putting them on my face.

And there's the 'normal' things like how I like my stuff to be placed in a certain way.

Maybe I'm overthinking and this isn't OCD.

Also lately I've been going weird around loud sounds. 

Like today I had like four different sound all around me and I just froze, like I couldn't carry on with making some food. (It's been happening a lot lately, just many different loud sounds all around me just makes me feel off, I don't really know how to describe it.

Basically I need everyone opinions.

I'm going back to college next week for a new course (so last thing I did was A-levels which is you don't know are separate subjects.) This course is an art course aka something I'm into. And because it's just art I feel like my stress will be lower (for a-levels I did very different subjects that were more writing based which wasn't the best idea.)

But ther's till the whole thing that there's going to be completely new teachers and people around me.

That paired with my 'OCD' is mostly to do with touching stuff and covid. And how I can't sit still in my chairs and how I need to fiddle with something.

Basically there's a whole fucking lot and I haven't even properly talked about my depression, suicidal thoughts, self harm and anxiety.

209,"The other day at work we had a going away zoom party for one of our older employees who was retiring. There were so many people saying so many great things about him (and rightfully so he's an awesome man). He's worked here for 3 years though as his old company was transitioning in changes and he didn't want to leave just yet, so he can and worked with us.

I'm not sure why but during his call I just stopped and thought, if I were to leave today there wouldn't be a zoom call. There wouldn't be speaking my praise, it would just be me leaving and nothing more.

It just got me thinking about life in general, how every relationship I have is a result of someone thinking I'm a great husband to their daughter/sister/friend or because I'm a great father to their grandchild/nephew. 

I don't have anyone in my life that genuinely knows me for me. I love being a father and a husband and those are really the only things that have given my life purpose to other people in the 30+ years I've been alive. They're new feelings. I didn't get married until I was 30. I didn't have kids until after I was married.

I'm just so used to being alone for my entire life that it feels fake if anyone says they care about me or they love me because they really don't even know me. They just love me because of how I treat the people they actually love. 

It's so hard to separate myself from being a father and husband. These are the things I'm most proud of in life, but at the same time it's also feels like I'm not ME anymore. I'm just an extension of someone else. I wouldn't trade my life for anything. I love my wife and my son more than anything and the life we've created is all I've ever wanted. It's heaven when we're together and we're a family. But in the nights where my son goes to sleep and my wife is doing something else not involving me I just feel empty inside.",01Sep2020,1

211,"Or has stopping another substance or activity notably improved your mental health?

I'm looking at the latest Public Health England data (an official government body here in England) that states over 1 in every 4 (26.8%) of adults suffering with a long term mental health condition are cigarette smokers in England.

This compares to the average smoking prevalence rate in England (as of 7th July 2020) being at 13.9%.

(data here for reference -  [https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/search/smoking](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/search/smoking))

I've also read on the UK's NHS website that ""stopping smoking can be as effective as antidepressants""

(also for reference -  [https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/quit-smoking/stopping-smoking-mental-health-benefits/](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/quit-smoking/stopping-smoking-mental-health-benefits/)) 

 I'm interested to hear about people's stories for how this might be the case, and what effect this ultimately had on your mental health...

\- How much did smoking cigarettes impact your health - physical and mental - directly? 

\- Did you find there was an indirect correlation with increased financial pressure? 

\- Would you recommend other smokers who are struggling with mental health issues to quit smoking before all else?",01Sep2020,1
212,"To start off with, i dont want sides picked or anything like that, i just meed to get my thoughts out. 

I recently ended 2 of ,y closest friendships. Ive been dealing with a lot of stress and mental health issues to do with psychosis and memory. Ive been thinking and being prompted and have come to realise a lot of my cherished as well as less pleasent memories never happened. My voices were telling me that everyone hated me and i should end my life, and at that point i couldnt help but believe them, so i abruptly cut ties with them. Ill admit i was slightly agressive when questioned about it, and thats on me, but afterwards the overwhelming guilt that i did it took over and i nearly took my life. The friendship with one of them was always rocky and i did this to protect myself from doing something id regret and toprotect them from doing something that could harm them. They took it as an offence (which i cant understand) but my voices amd hallucinations as well as how bad they took it refrained me from telling the whole story. The guilt is just overwhelming and i feel like i will never get over this. But i get small breaks of “this is the best for everyone and i did the right thing” but then is comes crashing down again. Im so lost and confused. And yes i have other friends, but im questioning if i am any good for them or if im just a burden that should just distance myself from everyone i know until they forget about me.

Sorry bit of a rant and trying to get something of my chest",01Sep2020,1
214,"At first i want to say sorry for my english, it isnt my primary language.

I had no easy childhood, my parents divorced and due to the missing father i wasnt easy to handle for my mum, she lost her job and got very ill so we always just had enough money to survive.

I was always a misfit, i gained a couple friends when i got to my second school in 5th grade but even those friends disappoint me very very often.

Those friends don’t live close to me and me and my family can’t afford a car for me and i don’t have friends in my town.
I cant buy one because i can’t work, I’ll tell u why: 

When i was 14 (I’m 18) i got diagnosed with Crohn’s disease and this illness controls most of my life and it hit me pretty hard, i have nearly every symptom you can get through this illness.
The illness and the side effects of my medication are limiting me a lot.

I missed a lot of school because i was always ill, people started to talk trash about me because my body is ill on the inside not on the outside.
Even the teachers made fun of me and gave me worse grades than i should’ve got, even if i i wrote the exact same things in tests as other students i got less points, the teachers always found a way to justify their behaviour.
Since October 19 i wasn’t in school because I’m never in a stable health condition, i have to take opioids to get out of bed in the morning otherwise i cant stand up due to pain.
Now i have to redo 12th grade, i did 2 years in school for nothing, i still don’t have any more than i had after 10th grade.
School makes it really hard for me, they never understood my health situation and they never will, even if my doctors tell them im in a bad condition they still want me to do a lot of work and just ignore everything they get told and they keep giving me bad grades due to that.

Due to getting ill i isolated myself since the end of 2019 and covid makes everything worse.

The only people that loved me in my life are my family and even there i always was the outsider.
If they weren’t there i would already be dead but i don’t want them to find my dead body.

If i meet a friend it is because i ask him, never the other way around and I’m always Plan B for them, i never get preferred about other people.

I never got loved by a girl, i never got attention and that hits really really hard.
I just want to be loved and feel closure but no girl ever was at least a bit interested in me.

All those things made me really introverted,
I can’t start and hold a conversation without it being weird for the other person and i can’t even tell my mother that i love her but i really do...

I always try to make it right for everyone,
but no-one recognizes it or me.

I really like it. Mostly because it's 100% anonymous. At first I was thinking hell I could just use a twitter and not have my real info. But then I noticed there aren't any profiles. They took away the whole fame and influencer BS like on other apps.

It's for ""mental health"" and allowing people to get stuff off their chests, minds etc and many of the posts are very interesting. As expected there's a lot of posts about the pandemic, racism and cop issues of what's going on today. But at least it's not hate posts and it's mostly people wanting to understand more.

Looks like they just launched the app last month. I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of traction it gets because it's not the first anonymous app that's been created.

The biggest thing they probably have going for them is that it's super simple and it's really good timing because so many people are losing family, friendships and even jobs for expressing themselves. Mind you some of them deserve it because it's hate but there's some that's just a misunderstanding.

Language generates and supports perspective. Language influences thought and action. Not only is the word 'mental' inaccurate in describing a disorder, but its negative perspectives and implications promulgate perceptions of incompetence, unworthiness, and undesirability. It is the dominant source of stigma, shame, and self-denigration. Realistically, we cannot eliminate the word 'mental' from models of healthcare. Still, we should utilize it sparingly, and only to differentiate a disorder from a physical injury or ailment.

236,"CW: Mention of self-harm and suicidal thoughts

I live in the UK and I have been having ongoing issues with my local mental health team and I wanted to ask if anyone had any advice/ any personal experience with this.

Firstly, the mental health team are refusing to formally diagnose me with BPD. Multiple GPs and mental health nurses have stated that they are very sure that I have BPD, and my current Senior Practitioner said that she couldn’t think of anything else that it could be. Their reasoning for not pushing through for a formal diagnosis, is that I am too young (I am 20 and have had symptoms for nearly 8 years now). I have asked to speak directly to a psychiatrist to discuss a diagnosis and a possible change to the medications that I am taking. My GP has sent a letter to them asking for this to happen, as they do not feel comfortable with changing my medication and they would like to seek some expert advice. The mental health team replied saying that they were not considering a formal diagnosis at this time and ignored the request for a psychiatrists input regarding my medication.

Secondly, I spoke to one of the GPs in January who referred me for DBT, he explained that it is preferable to access DBT rather than adding in more medication. After waiting and attempting to get an update on what was happening due to the pandemic, I was told that someone would be in touch. A few more months later, my case worker explained that because I was actively self-harming and had suicidal thoughts, they could not provide DBT, and so it had basically been cancelled without discussing it with me first. They have said that I need to stop self-harming and having suicidal thoughts before DBT can begin, but won’t provide much assistance in the meantime. This is particularly frustrating as through my own research I have found that the first things that are covered in DBT seem to be how to cope with self-harm and suicidal thoughts.

Thirdly, my case worker claims to understand how BPD is affecting my life but she is only discussing emotional sensitivity, and advising me to work through the workbook that she has provided. I have told her that I am getting worse and worse and that I am really struggling to cope. She said that I should work on the techniques in the workbook when I was feeling calm and just use the techniques that I am already familiar with in the mean time, but those techniques aren’t helping me get better and I just seem to be getting worse.

Finally, I feel like I am not being taken seriously. The crisis team usually tell me to call back during working hours to speak to my case worker. Liaison Psychiatry at the hospital usually just fill in a report and send that and a message to my case worker, asking them to speed up any referrals and to contact me about the support that I am requesting. This doesn’t really help me make much progress. My boyfriend has been trying to look after me for a long time now and he is struggling to do so, he called them a while ago and begged for some support for me, and I still seem to be receiving the minimum support that they can offer. 

I just feel like i’m hitting a brick wall at every turn and I wanted to know if anyone had any advice or tips on what I can do. I’ve looked at going private but I simply can’t afford it.",01Sep2020,1

238,"I am a bi male age 20. I met this guy in March on Grindr. He is 21 years old bi. We met in mid March right before the covid crisis happened. I went over and we ended up hooking up and we had fun. From then on we were talking, texting, FaceTiming. He lives alone with two dogs and works at the same time. He told about his past life. At the age of 17 he had meningitis where he was hospitalized and in coma for 1 week. Sadly when he woke up he lost some percentage of his memory. I felt so sad when he said this to me and it put a heavy weight on my chest to be there for him no matter what. During his early teenage life his mom and dad was in a toxic relationship and they had to break up. His brother is in the hood and doesn’t care about anything. Which this shows that my friend has a very tough life. July 31 was the day we decided to meet up again where cases were dying down in Canada. That week I messaged him for a follow up and he didn’t reply. I got a message randomly at night where his cousin past away. I was shocked and speechless. At this point I felt hurt and confused with this friendship. When ever we would talk it would be once a week. Sometimes he would say he’ll get back and call me and never did so I started to get emotionally exhausted. So after his cousin passed away I decided that It was time for me to step back and tell him how I’m feeling for the best for us both I told him that, “I’m just going to be totally honest here, I’m emotionally exhausted I care a lot about you man. I’ve just been saddened. Since the first day I met you we had many similarities with life problems and this just bonded me so close to you. knowing you’re a hard working man trying to stand on your own feet which I’m proud of but I think the loss communication has affected me so hard that I feel hurt. I’m not a person where I bitch about my emotions to anyone. It’s all my fault to even begin with, entering into your life and make you communicate which is what you hate the most. The unfair life stories you told me growing up and your time of recovery at The hospital has put a heavy weight on my chest. I didn’t want to leave you. I needed to be there for you where no one was or will be. I felt I needed to just say hi or check up on you. I don’t want you to feel sorry because it’s not your fault! Dude I might have to leave your life because I’m getting really hurt here I’ve tried to see you and it’s like the universe doesn’t want us together. Please put sex aside because If I was only here for sex I wouldn’t be here in the first place” after this he didn’t message me so I thought he ghosted me. Couple days later I got a message from him saying that he was at a metal hospital and that he couldn’t take it anymore and that his mother made him check him self in. Coincidently this day I got into cardiac arrest and I couldn’t breath and I was rushed to the hospital. So I woke up in the recovery room and checked my phone immediately and he said that he wishes I feel better as well. After couple days I came out and started to check up on him if he was doing well I started to message him day to day to see if his okay. He told me he was at his moms for a couple days because the doctors wouldn’t let him say alone. I told my mom about what had happened as she seen my rapid change of mood. she got a hold of one of her friends that is a psychiatrist and they recommend us to buy him LEGO to make him feel better and clear his mind. Last week on Wednesday I went over to his work to surprise him not letting him know. I went over and the receptionist told me that he was doing half days now, so I left the gift over at his desk and decided to head on to his apartment. Thinking him seeing me would make him feel better after 7 months of not seeing each other, I nocked on his door and he didn’t open and I nocked on his door again and he opened it. He was sleeping because of his medication that his psychiatric prescribed. When he opened the door he was shook and he was talking weird because I accidentally woke him up, anyways we spoke abit and he started to hug me randomly and talk again and hug me again then he gave me a kiss on the neck. I told him to head back to sleep because he was tired and he asked me when he I’ll be free and I said Saturday so he agreed and I told him to promise me that he’ll see me. So I left his apartment telling him to head back to sleep. Friday comes by and I message him a follow for the meet up. I was feeling excited and happy that maybe I’ll try to make him happy and confront him. He replied saying that he’ll be calling me. I waited and the phone rang so I was positive and happy I asked him how his day was. He told me he needed to say something and I asked him by all means he can tell me. He said that he was feeling overwhelmed that I was caring about him. He told me that we were two different people and that he wasn’t the type to have Constant conversations and friends. He said he appreciated everything and that I was a nice person. He told me that we should stop talking for awhile. I obviously told him that I’ll be here for him and that no matter what I’ll always love him. He told me that he didn’t know what to say anymore. He said that when I came over to see him that day it hit him how serious I was caring for him. He was thanking for faltering him but we should stop. He told me that we can talk here and there and that we can try again in a couple months. The one thing that he said out of his respect was to not ghost me or block me. So I was feeling sad on the phone and I needed to wrap the phone call up. So I told him to promise me one thing and he said what? and I told him that I don’t want him to do anything to himself. He didn’t reply for couple seconds and I re stated the sentence saying I don’t want you to hurt your self. He said promise in a weird tone. My emotions were kicking in and I told him that I needed to head out. After the phone ended I started to cry.

239,"So I’ve always struggled with my mental health (mainly depression and anxiety) but I had my first panic attack in April and it’s absolutely ruined my mental health. I was really anxious over graduating college and not being sure what I wanted to do for grad school or my life etc. The pandemic probably didn’t help my anxiety either.

Ok so I'll just list what I got so everyone knows what I'm working with..MDD, PTSD, bipolar 2 disorder, panic/anxiety.

Anyways, so I got all that shit going on and I do have medications prescribed to me. Problem is, I had surgery 3 months ago which prevented me from taking them. 

I had weight loss surgery back in June and I developed what's called a stricture. Basically the opening of my stomach was smaller than an eraser tip which made me throw up any pills I took. I got really sick. I've been cycling due to my bipolar disorder. It's been really hard for me because I was living alone at the time. 

I also had MANY complications after surgery. I developed nerve damage. I now cannot walk or take care of myself. I had to move out of my apartment and I now live with my cousin... she's my caretaker now. 

I got my stomach dilated (they stretched the opening of my stomach) so i can now take my meds again. 

My problem is I am just dealing with sooooo much shit right now, I feel like I'm going to explode. I'm pretty much bed ridden now, I can barely walk with the use of a walker. I just found out that my dad has liver cancer and I'm also trying to figure out what's wrong with me. 

It's just too much to handle... my mom died of cancer 2 years ago. I was there with her when she died. I saw the color drain from her body. I have PTSD from this. I'm so scared that I'm going to have to see my dad die as well. Idk I just have to be with him, I can't let him die alone. 

I've been having flashbacks of my mom and I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to take care of my dad (when he comes home he in the hospital) from a bed...i am not physically able to take care of him.

Idk I'm just freaking out. I have no friends to talk to, only people I talk to is my dad and my cousin. I have a boyfriend but he hates my dad so there's no point in talking to him about it. 

I'm scared that I'll be this way for the rest of my life. I'm in constant pain from the nerve damage, I'm cycling, I'm super fuckin depressed and I just know my dad's gonna die soon...i am an only child, so there goes my family. 

I just need to vent, sorry this is so long and kinda all over the place. I wish i had a friend to talk to or someone. I lost my therapist and my psychiatrist because I moved so now I have nothing.

My dad is kind of strict about me going out on school days (i’m still in highschool whoo) so I got to see my boyfriend at least once or twice a week, maybe more. I still made time for my best friend though (especially since my dad made an exception with her and i was able to see her whenever and wherever) and my boyfriend even brought her along with us and that’s how she met her current boyfriend. The anger towards me for not making enough time for her ended kind of but then she would start asking if she could come along on our dates to see her boyfriend (my boyfriend and her boyfriend were good friends). But the thing about relationships is doing stuff together. Like alone. Just the two of us. We didn’t mind bring her around a few times but slowly, we started getting zero alone time. And when I would try to tell her we wanted to have a day where we hung out alone, she would get angry because it wasn’t easy for her to get rides to see her boyfriend. This lead to my boyfriend kind of developing negative feelings towards her. He’s told me he doesn’t like the way she treats me and normally if someone I was with said anything about my best friend, I would be pissed, but. I understood? Since all that happened, our friendship was just kind of weird. Then covid happened and we weren’t hanging out as much. Due to me being home, my mental health was all over the place. I was crying everyday, I wasn’t able to leave the house, I felt lonely as fuck, it just sucked and I wanted to just be alone. After a few months, she unadded me on snapchat and instagram and I didn’t want to start an argument by asking what happened and I honestly just didn’t care. But then my sister told me she got in touch with her and told her she was upset because I didn’t reach out to her? Like that’s my fault? But I don’t know. Does this situation even make sense? I just need some advice. There’s a bunch more information that would probably make parts of this story make better sense so just let me know if you have any questions.",01Sep2020,1

252,"I'm not a doctor. There. 
However, my gf of 1 year this month, has shaken me with some of her behavior. 
I simply want opinions on whether or not I should seek professional help, or she's just a typical woman.  She isn't my first long term relationship. I've had one other long one. And the woman was just as crazy but in different ways 
Now the behavior.
-She often forgets what she says. And then states she didn't say that, with a total look of conviction and confusion.  Then when I quote her exactly,  she remembers. 
-She rambles when arguing and just says nonsense.  For example she was listing things that she doesn't like that I do last night, and then she says, ""what's our dog doing"" as one of the things she thinks is controlling of me to ask. I said how is that wrong of me to ask, she then said ""I just said it cause I saw him sitting there."" It's nonsense and happens a lot.
Ok now the real crazy stuff. 
-She once threatened to jump out of the car as i was driving because she got upset at me. 
She often will leave and walk out into the night when we have arguments. With no money, car or anything. Just walking out in the city at night crying, as a 125lb girl. I often have to put whatever argument we had aside just to get her home safely.  
Just yesterday I had to drive up and down the freeway begging her to get in the car,  as she had left the house and just started walking.  To me no matter how mad you get, this behavior is high risk and it troubles me that she just puts herself out there like that with no regard for her safety. 
-she's an admitted alcoholic.  Which she only admitted after lying for months and being caught finally  
Few weeks back she's begging me to let her go so she can drink
-she has violent outbursts where she'll throw her phone or hit a wall or knock something over.
says she fears nothing constantly 
--shes always saying she'll be better off dead. She'll get into a shouting match with me and say, ""do it, hit me, just kill fucking kill me"".
That's a direct quote from about a week and a half ago. 
-She accuses me of lusting after every woman I see. 
-She forms scenarios in her head of me cheating and believes them. 
-She has a very high sex drive(her parents had sex in the same room as her when she was old enough to remember,  regularly)and every time she drinks she blacks out and ends up having sex/raped. This is not currently happening.  
However her begging to go back to alcohol again makes me think she's okay with those results.  Which again is reckless.   
-She cries constantly over small things, is extremely sensitive,  and takes everything to heart, has serious trust issues with me, although I've never cheated on her. 
I'm mainly concerned about her safety, the walking out into the night or up and down a highway is just so bizarre to me. I can't rationalize the behavior. 
This all sounds mild I guess, but I promise you it's a rollercoaster ride and much worse, I just can't put it into words. I think she is bipolar or has some anxiety disorder. Along with depression.

255,"I don’t know if it’s a symptom/side effect of my depression, but I’ve been getting really bad sleep paralysis nightmares more recently. Like to the point I have multiple back to back. A couple nights ago it got to the point where I had to INDUCE a lucid dream to check if I was asleep or awake and when I realized I was still sleeping I forced myself awake.


I sleep around 10pm~5am then 5.30am~8am (the gap is due to waking up from the sleep paralysis cycles) so I still get a good amount of sleep. Even without the nightmares I get exhausted around 3-4pm and have to sleep or else I feel sick but then I nap for an hour or so and wake up even more exhausted.


I don’t drink caffeine, except tea, but even then I’ve been drinking tea since I was a baby so the little amount of caffeine doesn’t bother me.


I don’t know what to do to fix the exhaustion and stop the nightmares. Any tips for either would be appreciated. Mostly for the sleep paralysis as with the mid day exhaustion I might just try drinking coffee or an energy drink when I get exhausted to see if I crash or if I wake up.


So, any tips on stopping sleep paralysis or even lighten the effects. I usually know when I’m in that state because I can’t move so I shut my eyes and try to sleep but then I “wake up” into another sleep paralysis cycle and it continues about 2-4 times to the point I’m questioning whether I’m actually asleep or awake.",01Sep2020,1

263,"TL;DR : He’s (14) sad all the time, has started having bad mood swings, watches a lot of gaming content. I try my best to help him, but I’m holding it all by a thread and not sure how to help him.  

I (21m) honestly don’t know what to do.  
He’s 14. A few days back, he broke the computer monitor in anger because he was arguing with one of his classmates online (apparently that classmate used to call him names for a long time but I never knew about it, more on maybe why below); he felt immediately guilty right after and cried for a good hour straight. I did manage to console him and get him to feel okay. And I think I managed to get his situation with his friend sorted too (he’s chosen to not talk to him anymore which I think is a good decision).  
But his mental has been all over the place ever since, maybe even before this.  

I feel like it might help to provide some relevant background, I’ll try to keep it as short and concise as possible -  
1. He didn’t have the best upbringing. If anything, he had a very rough and bleak upbringing. He was almost always with at most two people growing up (me and mom).  
2. My parents are textbook narcissists and emotionally abusive towards both of us.  
3. As a result of which he has a very hard time socialising. He has friends but it takes him a great amount of effort and ‘faking it’ to make friends, so much so that once he’s made friends in a new place he’s exhausted and will do anything to keep them (even if they don’t necessarily treat him right).  
4. He’s become addicted to video games (battle-royale games) during this pandemic. It used to be controlled gaming before, but now he plays 5-6 hours a day and it’s very very hard to get him to do anything else.  
5. It’s not hard to tell that he’s just trying to fit in wherever he goes and has very little self confidence.  
6. He cares more about what people think of him, than what he thinks of himself (not a whole lot).  

I make it a point to spend a few hours with him everyday even if he doesn’t like it and just wants to get back on that computer. But since he’s broken the monitor, he seems very -  
1. Unstable, ticky, fidgety.  
2. One moment he feels like laughing and the next he feels like crying.  
3. Wants to be left alone all the time (this was since the pandemic, when he started gaming a ton). It’s very hard to enter his room without him starting to get annoyed and just tell me to get out of the room in the first few seconds (I deal with it very very patiently and try my best to make him laugh or divert his attention so that I can trick him into spending time with me, and not be alone).  
4. He watches a ton of gaming content in YouTube now that he can’t game anymore. And it’s worrying me a lot.  

So, I guess I have a few questions to help me deal with this. If anyone had a good suggestion otherwise too, I’d be more than happy to listen cause I‘ll take all the help I can get at this point.  

1. Is it a good idea to essentially force him to play something like Stardew Valley instead of Apex Legends? Or allot a certain amount of time where he HAS to play a relaxing game instead of these crazy mind eating battle royale games, just to get started? Force him, because he’s said no to playing Stardew Valley or Abzu already. (I never tell him gaming in general is bad, I know it’s a bad idea to mention that cause he’ll be repelled even further).
2. It takes a massive chunk of my energy every day to spend time with him (I never ever let it show of course). I attend uni from home right now and keeping up with coursework and helping him could turn out to be difficult. If I could choose one I’d definitely go with spending time with him all day, but I also have to get that degree to get him out of the house and situation he’s in. Is there anything I can do to make him okay?  

I’d appreciate any feedback at all. Literally, any.",01Sep2020,1

269,"I don’t feel like writing the same thing over and over so I’ll keep this short: over the summer in July I got really depressed because nothing was going on, and noticed I was engaged in some more deviant adult media, but couldn’t get aroused by the more vanilla or even tamer vanilla stuff. I still had interests and was always fantasizing in my own head. Especially fantasies about love. I was planning on maybe one day writing a romantic comic or something. I also had other plans lined up but kept putting it off. I had plenty of interests but was too “ehhhh...” to really engage at the moment. 

Anyway, I saw an article on overexposure causing ED, so I decided to go cold turkey. I also decided to look up withdrawal symptoms to prepare myself (not good of you’re a hypochondriac like me). 

Anyway I noticed my already depressed mood worsen a bit. I tried to do things, but there wasn’t much to do. Also I started noticing sexual stuff more often and for some reason it started making me uncomfortable. I noticed how a lot of the things I watched or looked at may have had elements of my deviant side in them, and that made me feel a bit uncomfortable too. 

I called my therapist after a few days of this. I could still do things like fantasize and watch nature documentaries and read comics, but something started to feel... off. 

I spoke to my therapist about the stuff I was into, which led to me thinking about EVERY questionable thing I was into. When my therapist said “it’s okay to be into that stuff, just enjoy it for what it is” I felt like I couldn’t go back. The dilemma of what’s okay what isn’t started forming in my head. What was I even into in the first place? I found myself with intrusive thoughts (first just about the fact that I was gross for being aroused by that stuff, then about being some sort of sociopath for being into that stuff, then just being some sort of sociopath).

I started feeling even more not myself and started to panic google mental disorders,, which sealed my fate. For the rest of the month I felt myself get further and further. I stopped feeling interested in videogames, movies, TVshows, and even nature. I found that I couldn’t connect or empathize anymore. Also my intrusive thoughts were getting worse at the same time. (Which caused a viscous cycle of panic and google.

I got really existential too, when I thought “I might X thing maybe partially because of a perversion” followed by “why does that matter” followed by “why does ANYTHING matter?” “Why does life or death matter?”

the only friends i have atm arent gonna be around much longer as they’re going off to live their own lives, and i just feel left out with no idea of what makes me happy. dealing with my mental issues caused me to miss out on a lot of school so my grades were not as good as i would’ve liked, and going to uni isnt really an option for me. i just don’t know how to go out and live my life. making friends or any kind of relationship is difficult for me and i hate forcing myself into things i don’t like. i’m just very lost.",01Sep2020,1

295,"I live in Nigeria, I'm gay. I come from a really traditional and religious Christian family and so I'm not out to anyone of them. I can sometimes have feminine mannerisms and it's something I try to hide because it has earned me a lot of physical and verbal abuse from family, friends and classmates. I do have some safe spaces were I can vent a bit and express my self to an extent, but these days with corona virus I've been stuck indoors with my family for a much longer time than I would like, I'm becoming emotional exhausted, on a daily basis, I sometimes imagine writing a note coming out to them and telling them how much they've hurt me over the years then killing myself. I probably would have a long time ago if not for the fear of hell that has been drilled into me since childhood, I have some other shit going on but this is probably the biggest one.

296,"My father has been a narcissist my whole life. When I was young he'd beat me with a belt and spank and do all of those things that I'm sure many other people went through as well. He seldom interacted with me and when he did it was usually him being upset with me about something and yelling or trying to intimidate me. He was never proud of me, and I think this lead to me having validation issues and I've always felt the need to be validated by others. He abused my mom a lot. I've had to call the police on him twice because he was choking my mom. He blames her for his cheating on her and tells her all kinds of terrible things to make her feel bad about herself. He takes no responsibility for his actions. He always used to tell me ""I can't wait until you enter the real world"" because then I'd know how hard it is and he expected me to fail. I feel like he was right. 

My mom has always been an incredibly kind person. She's always tried really hard to stay positive despite all of our struggles. A consequence I believe of that is that she's always kind of turned her head to negativity and when terrible things happen she tries to down play how bad they are. She has good intentions I believe, but I think that this lead to a distinct lack of discipline in my life and allowed my abusive father to stay in the picture. She's only just now moving away from him and getting her own house after being with him for 33 years.

Well, now I'm 26 and I've made a lot of mistakes in my life. I realize I've been a narcissistic asshole for at least the last 10 years and I've harmed people by being that way. I have a lot of regret about the kind of person I've been for the last 10 years and I really, really hate that I can't go back and change it. I have anxiety and depression that I've been struggling with for at least 10 years as well. All day every day I think negative thoughts about everything. About myself, about others, about all kinds of things. I dwell on the past and worry about the future all day to the point that I don't enjoy the present. I love playing video games but it's pretty much all I've been doing during this time and I believe this is in part because it is escapism. It allows me to run and hide from my problems, problems I don't really know how to fix. 

I want a good life for myself and for the people around me. I know my negativity and mental health issues are ruining me and harming the people around me. How can I resolve these issues? Can they be resolved at 26? I've started trying to see a therapist in these last few months, but I have kaiser permanente and I've only been able to see a therapist once every month and a half and when I do see them I can only talk to them for 45 minutes before I have to schedule another appointment a month and a half away. I feel like I'd need to talk with a therapist at least once a week and for several hours, but I don't know how to get therapy like that.

Can I fix these problems?",01Sep2020,1
297,"Hey all, I'm a guy(29) living a okay life. I'm fit and healthy, No money worries, a stable job which I'd even view that as blessing considering there are lots of people out there worse off. Even with all this going on I just feel numb and empty. 

My job is okay. Management believe that I'd make a good  manager though it's not enticing they expect you to travel etc with a rather small pay increase. At the end of that day it pays the bills. I'd say Im not particularly skilled at much. Or I am I just don't have enough drive or passion to chase something right now. Neither do I have a job to aim for.

I'm single, most of the time I'm happy with that, then on occasion I just feel really bloody lonely I'm human at the end of the day I guess! I've tried dating apps which aren't the most productive thing, they generally make me feel a million times worse. Sometimes reinforcing my own self image that I'm not good enough. 

I have friends. Mostly people I work with, yet outside of that I'd probably say I have 2-3 friends which has diminished massively since I was much younger. I have never been much of a party goer, that type of thing is my personal sense of hell. 

Family wise my parents are divorced, I get a long with them both. I'd say I'm the closest with my brother and regularly weight lift together at the gym. My sister(27) on the other hand is a whole different story itself we barely get on.

Outside of the work place I'm working out, I'm not in the best of shape, my view is I still need to loose a bit of fat from around the waist and I could be doing better, but I tend to comfort eat quite a bit with sugary foods etc. Which in it's self is my bane, sweet tooth and all. Other than that I'm usually relaxing watching films or playing video games.

TLDR: Even though my life is quite comfortable. I just feel empty. Plodding along life, turning 30 with what it feels like little to no purpose. It's a odd feeling to have.

298,"I have always struggled with focus as my mind likes to frequently take me off into random directions all of the time. Sometimes I'll just be 100% focused and then suddenly think about a random event and start making up little scenarios. I catch myself doing it and try to rip myself back to reality sometimes but it's annoying how frequently this happens. I had trouble in past relationships for ""zoning out"" but whilst to other people it seemed rude, to me it was just uncontrollable. Another thing I have noticed is that if I get something wrong straight away which I knew I shouldn't have then I will immediately feel like everything from that point onward is an uphill struggle; sometimes leading me to give up completely. If I had the right mindset to begin with then maybe I would be more consistent and less worried about messing up (since when I worry about messing up I will be more likely to mess up as well!

I always try my best to do my daily chores and have a routine to ease the rain. And it has worked wonders. This routine along with meds has me at a place where I can manage my depression. Yes somedays there are thunderstorms, but I get through.

Anyway, what happened yesterday truly surprised me. I felt happy. Like a giddy type of happy a kid would at a candy store. I don't know what happened. Nothing changed in my life to spark this. I had a day with no cloud. 100% sunny skies for the WHOLE day.

This thoroughly confused me. I haven't had any day like this that I can remember and it came out of no where. What would cause this? I feel strange for asking, but it felt strange being happy. Maybe for an hour or two I feel calm (big emphasis on maybe), but not happy and definitely not for an entire day.

302,"I should start by saying I'm a 20yo female. I'm just wondering how healthy or typical this form of thing is considered. I do have family history of skyzophrenia, bipolar, anxiety, autism, and depression. I myself have paranoia, social anxiety, depression and mania. I think I may have narcolepsy or insomnia, but it seems more episodic. 
I have had hypnopompic hallucinations in the past, about ten or so times in the last three years. Ill wake up and right away see something that typically terrifies me, then ill scream and run for the door. Ill remember them vividly.
I've also often have had black figures that aren't really there. Say, I see a shadow move and it looks like a monster but it isnt even real. I always chalk that up to paranoia though. 
But today I saw one vividly. Full color, still feels like he was still standing there. I looked over at a chair and for a second I saw this pale, tall, blonde, green eyed guy leaning over it and grinning at me. He was young, maybe a teenager.

304,"August welcomed my five years on HRT. It has been five years since I began my journey living as my authentic self. Five years since I was given a second chance at life. Transitioning was the start of a new being, a reincarnation. Becoming a butterfly in a world full of lizards. August also welcomed a turning point for a condition that I have spent years trying to brush off as frivolous. Since my transition began I have been consistently rebuilding, always on the go. I have had to cognitively re-frame my life to fit what it means for me to be this new individual. Not only what it means to be this new individual for me but what it means for others as well, and how I present myself. My life began at 22, not at birth. Until I began my transition I was stuck in a constant state of limbo, the world passing me by while I watched from the inside of a body that I knew was not my own. I found it difficult to focus, both at school and at home. I missed a lot of time from school, there is much I cannot recall reading, studying, learning. Thinking back now it feels as if I was never really there, even on the days that I physically was. Often it feels as though my childhood was stolen from me. Since transitioning it has felt as though I have had to re-learn much that I do not remember. With family I often feel like a new member, with less time given to me to establish new relationships with everyone. In a way, I feel like a child. Still learning, still growing. And other times I feel older, having had to mature faster than those around me due to my identity. I have had financial difficulties with transitioning, spending money on things to feel more like myself. Acquiring debt to feel free. Whether it be on laser hair removal for beard growth, a new wardrobe, hormones, therapy, etc.  I felt I had to prove my identity to others, to show that these feelings were not just a phase or a cry for help. Speaking with someone yesterday he made a point that resonated with me. While dealing with depression, it feels as if once again I am needing to prove myself. Depression takes on many forms. For me it is rooted in these thoughts that I describe above. It is an unshakable and deep sadness. It is living in a world that tells me I shouldn't exist. It is living in a world that tries to deny me rights. It is living in a world where I have needed to develop a thick skin. It is living in a world where people like me are murdered for being themselves. It is living in a world where I have lost people I have not been able to fully get to know, and them not getting to know me. It is living in a world full of lizards while I am trying to be a butterfly, afraid I am going to be devoured.",01Sep2020,1

There's this thing that happens to me that if someone names a thing, the mental image that comes in my mind is something different. So I end up confusing things and what people say a lot.

For example if someone says ""Batman"", wolverine will come to mind. And ill go on thinking they said wolverine when in fact they did not. If someone says ""blue"", a mental image of the colour orange will come Etc. The mental image that comes to my mind is from the same category but different.

Back in 2018 i went to a psychiatrist for the first time and said something wrong and i was placed in a psych ward for 3 days. I wasnt given any sort of diagnoses or future meeting. All that resulted in this was my parents loss of trust in me and now i am refused resources. Im a minor so i cant do this myself

I cant even get diagnosed. Theres something wrong with me but i dont know what because im not diagnosed. Every day I think could something have been different if early on I was able to get help. I don’t know how to cope with anything. The days are so useless. Every time any of my family members interact with me i get so angry. I dont want to talk to anyone anymore. I hate having a psychical body. I don’t want to be real. 
I wish there was a way so that instead of “death” every proof of me existing is erased. And everyone who knew me forgets i existed. I simply never existed. There was no me. 

Why is learning so hard? I cant focus on anything. I cant comprehend things. Something could be easy for 50,000 people but for some reason i just wont ever understand it. My brain just refuses to learn. Im always distracted by something. I feel more comfort and focus alone with my phone than anything, but then I get called lazy. I guess that’s right, I don’t want to participate in society anymore. School is horrible. Everything is horrible.  Out of 3 siblings I am the one who is used as reference when it comes to “how not to raise a child” “how to spot a failure when theyre young”    How did I turn out like this. Everything in me seems broken. I feel like I was a horrible defect produced in a factory, but instead of being discarded I somehow got sent out for shipment.

309,"We've been together almost 3 years. We're in our late 30's and share a vast group of friends and an entire world in common. We love each other so much. When he's not depressed, he's extremely affable, charming, FUN, weird, outgoing. But when the world catches up to him, he feels like a loser, like he's failing the people in his life, and he doesn't want to be here, and doesn't understand the point of anything.

He's always had a reason.

When we first met he was getting over a traumatic divorce in which his wife of 2 years decided she didn't love him anymore and she ghosted him and their entire community of friends. Then about a year into our relationship his mom passed away suddenly - and his relationship with her has tumultuous and fairly emotionally abusive. She was very critical of him. So her passing was very hard on  him.

Now we're living under Covid, the world is an extremely scary place, and he hates his job. They are all absolutely valid reasons to be depressed and anxious. I accept struggle and depression and not being OK. I just have a hard time watching him keep not doing anything different to support himself. 

Today he hardly even showed up for work. I found him staring out the window. Sitting on the couch doom scrolling. Sitting on the couch with his head in his hands. He barely has a word to say. It seems like during our working hours (we both WFH) he's just miserable. And cranky. Insecure and short-tempered. I'm getting better at dealing with it and so it he. But he's been this bad to some degree for the last 2 1/2 weeks.

We've spoken about therapy many times. I have always had a therapist when I could afford it as a matter of personal maintenance. He's noted that my going back into therapy during our relationship made me an easier person to be with. So I ask him to also see one so that we can both be the best we can be and have an outlet for our issues. He hasn't had a therapist since he and his ex-wife had a brief stint in marriage counseling. I understand why he's avoidant. He feels I've been pressuring him to seek therapy because I do bring it up when things get really bad. There's always been a reason why he can't go.

I do not want to look back 10 years from now and this '*When things are good, they're really great. I have this amazing partner who I love so much and who brings me a lot of joy. But when he's not feeling well, I don't exist. I have to walk on egg shells. I don't feel there's space for me.'* And of course this is deeply exacerbated by being mostly quarantined and having a very limited life right now. We spend just about every hour of every day in the same room. 

I'm losing empathy and patience. I don't understand how someone who is admittedly experiencing anxiety and depression wouldn't take some form of action that's different from what they've been doing before. It's not as though I haven't had my own bouts of depression and anxiety or lack the ability to understand mental health struggles. My own issues are present, but shoved below the surface because someone has to keep the household running. 

At any rate: I'm not sure what to do and I'm looking for some inspiration, ways of changing my own thinking, books, resources, encouragement... I'm currently reading through a list of self-help and mindfulness books to try to keep my head in a good way. But I thought I'd holler at the community while I'm at it &lt;3

My best friend is schizophrenic, that's mean that he see monsters and have auditory hallucinations telling to kill himself 24h/24 . On 5 years I know him ,he never been this bad . Since 2 months he doesn't go out anymore and leaved his job . He didnt told in detail what he feels cause he doesn't ever open up about this topic with anyone. He dont take pills you're supposed to take for schizophrenia cause he says they're really heavy and make him feel like a vegetable. Theres no cure to schizophrenia and what now medics in the world give to schizophrenic people is a palliative , a drug that reduces the hallucinations cause he literally sedate you, just for that. 
I dont know how to help him.. he helped me through a rough rough time myself with panic attacks and depression and I really dont know how to help him and I fear that he would kill himself cause it's been 2 months now he isolate himself and doesn't talk to anyone about his problems . He refuse to speak to my psychologist and I would pay for it (that is young and really good at his job , there aren't many where I live) he actually goes to a ""govt"" psychologist that is old and according to the things I ask him about their session or Julian doesn't talk of his real problems or the psychologist just give him banal answers. I dont know what to do.. I cant force him to take pills or to see a therapist ( the govt can with something called ""coervitive therapy "" but i am against this cause there are been cases in my country where total innocent person died being tied up for days without food in these places)

My brother was diagnosed with depression (and ocd, anxiety, and adhd) around the age of 15 I think, was on a ton of different meds, and went inpatient for a week or two in high school. He eventually seemed to work through it, stopped the meds, and graduated, and started working a few different jobs. He was doing pretty well, had a few good friends, was gaining skills and independence, and his dark days seemed behind him. 

Sadly this was not the case. Six years later around the age of 24, he started getting into a minor funk again. Nothing major, but any sort of conflict would ruin his week (like calling out of work due to car trouble and thinking his boss was mad at him) and he also had an insane amount of energy and insomnia. We convinced him to see a therapist again and he ended up going on some meds. He slowly declined, until this past February where one day I was visiting him and within 10 minutes he laughed, cried, screamed, then was laughing again...he just seemed all over the place and he is usually a very quiet and calm person despite his issues. 

Here’s where the real story begins: he ended up willingly inpatient again, and was diagnosed with Bipolar on top of all his original issues. He got out, found a psychiatrist and has been doing trial and error on dozens of meds ever since and nothing seems to be working. Also, right when he got out, Covid hit so now he’s been isolated and out of work for 6 months which makes it worse. 

For the past 6 months he has barely left his bed. He cries and sleeps all day. He says even things like showering or brushing his teeth are too painful. He goes on and on about how he’s disabled and will never be able to accomplish anything and not to say he’s faking or doesn’t have struggles but it’s all he talks about and even with my parents and I trying to hold his hand and help him with things he has made no effort to change his situation. He’s in the mindset that one day he’ll find the right medicine and his life will be fine again. He is not willing to be uncomfortable in the slightest and is very dramatic when we suggest anything other than laying in bed. 

We’re all very worried about him but we’re kind of at the end of our rope. It seems like we’ve run out of options and we’re just hoping one day he’ll want to make a change but so far nothing has helped him get to that point. Even his medical team seems to be running out of options. 

We’re having a family meeting (minus my brother) in a few days to discuss our course of action. We feel like we need to push him more and give him some sort of responsibility and consequences, but nervous if we push him too much it might send him over the edge and he’ll do something he can’t take back. 

Does anyone have any ideas or thoughts on how to get him to be a functioning member of society and not see his issues as a death sentence? I don’t know if there’s other types of treatments or methods we’re not aware of. 

Thank you if you made it through all of this! I just want my brother to be okay.",01Sep2020,1
331,"I have OCD. Lately the obsessive thoughts have been really bad, it’s hard to work or think because I’m obsessing over a particular bad situation. I’ve tried looking up some tips but all I’m finding is exercise and meditation. While I’m sure those work, I don’t have enough time in my day lately. 

What helps you when you can’t get a thought out of your head?",01Sep2020,1
333,"So my sister has this friend. They’re both 17, and  my sister is going through a depression. Anyway, she’s gotten drunk in past, and I (15f) never told my parents about it. It’s a trust thing between siblings, but anyway this friend takes antidepressants, and overall is just not a good influence. Literally she goes 90 to 104 (fastest she’s gone) on country roads. She doesn’t have a real adult license, it’s a license where you can only drive 1 person who isn’t related to you (she drove around 4 ppl in total, none of us 4 were related to her). Anyway, she breaks a lot of rules. My sister stole a bottle of vodka from this friend’s house, and when said friend found out, my sister had already drank a ton. This friend then drank a bunch too.
My little sister (12) and I were waiting in the car, when the friend come over to me and tells me we have to talk. I ask what’s going in and she tells me that my sister is drunk and having a panic attack. I’ve never known much about alcohol. But anyway. The other person there is another friend, and I was pretty tight with them, me, my sister, and them have a group chat together. So I go to my sister and she literally can’t even sit up, she’s talking nonsense and sobbing about how she “was supposed to be fine” and how she “didn’t want to ruin everything” she was begging me every 2 seconds to not tell mom and dad. I’ve never done well with shit like this. I was tearing up just looking at her, I couldn’t think clearly and I kept getting told “Nobody can know about this”

So the other friend (he only had a permit) was told to drive to the first friend’s house. I asked this friend if my sister was in any danger of alcohol poisoning and I was told no. I didn’t know that being drunk meant having alcohol poisoning or whatever. I thought this was just “she’ll feel like shit but be fine” But anyway we drove to the house, but we missed the turn so the permit friend started doing a 3 point turn when my sister opens the car door and tries to get out. Somebody saw and called my parents bc they knew my sister. So my parents howe’s up at the house and had my sister throw up in a bag. She’s okay now I think, I had practice so I haven’t seen her in about 2 hours. 

I know that from now on I’ll always call my parents at least, because I just didn’t know enough but now I do. It’s just... idek I’m just so fucking messed up from this. She’s going to fucking spiral and spiral until she kills herself and I don’t know how to react in the moment. I freeze up and I just can’t do it right...",01Sep2020,1
334,"Hi! i have been thinking about this topic for a very very long time and it still confuses me. To start, i have constant chronic depression, social anxiety and a few other illnesses. But the hardest side effect you could say, is having zero interest or love for activities, hobbies or skills or talents. 

I graduated highschool (i’m 20) with diplomas for computer science and game development. i was into 70s - 2000s horror movies, a few sports, trying new food, going out, finding new music. i had tons of heart for trying NEW THINGS. But this girl asked me a very simple question a little over a year ago and it will not leave my mind.
“tell me 5 of your interests and hobbies” 
I can’t. do i even have 5? 
I did but do i anymore? 

I always try to find new stimulating activities or simple things in life to look forward too, but everytime i try its as boring as watching paint dry. 

I’m not sure if anybody has suggestions for things to get into, or how to break this cycle, or what. im open anything thank you :)",01Sep2020,1
