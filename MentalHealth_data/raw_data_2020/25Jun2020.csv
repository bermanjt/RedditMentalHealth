0,"My girlfriend just left me, now I have no one else to share about all my mental illness. I feel alone, rejected. Other than having no one to discuss the biggest part of my life. I suffer from anxiety ED, that means that it is really difficult to me to have sex with someone that I don't completely trust. I'm scared and hopeless. Does anyone have any tips. But mostly, can anyone give me some kind messages. It would really help. Thank you all in advance.",25Jun2020,1
2,"Everyone says pictures aren't real life...but I don't know how to believe it. I've struggled with making friends my whole life. It hurts to see people posting pictures of their fun adventures and social gatherings with their friend circles. It hurts to see people make posts on how much they love their BFFs like family, how they will be with their BFFs till they die, and how fun their adventures are with their BFFs. It hurts to see people post screenshots of their hilarious group chats or individual text messages. It hurts to see people post pics of their wild bachelor(ette) parties and a million groomsmen and bridesmaids.

It hurts since I'm too incapable of making social ties like that - even introverts can make BFFs and maintain an active social life (with fewer people).",25Jun2020,1

4,"My dad died last Saturday after four years of sickness. I’ve cried a couple of times and when I really get to remembering him, I’m very sad but (even before his death) it’s like my brain is wired to distract itself from confronting my emotions. I’m capable of doing it, I just really don’t dwell. Is this a warning sign? My sister has felt consistent sadness but I feel like I haven’t allowed myself to connect to my feelings about his death and illness. Any tips for connecting to emotion?

7,"To start I will say that I live in North America and I'm in my late 30's

I have struggled with depression and anxiety for most of my life and at times it has manifested itself as anger and unpredictability. Some might even say I have experienced mania.

Up until 3 years ago I had never sought any treatment as I have experience with mental health on a professional level. With the birth of my daughter I could no longer ignore my issues. I wasn't getting enough sleep and I ended up taking a job that made matters worse. My partner at the time identified that I might be bipolar so I sought help for that specifically. 

Basically an ER doc ticked off some boxes and made that diagnosis. Eventually I saw a real psychiatrist and that was ruled out.

I started having sleep issues again last month along with marital problems. The arguing brought out so much anger in me that once again I went to the ER to see if I could get help. They offered me Seroquel and not much more. Of course the issues never went away so upon my second visit to the hospital they suggested I go to another hospital that specializes in psychiatric care for an assessment. This was all voluntary I was told and at most I'd be there for 72 hours.

Well a week later I was still there, on the wrong medication and highly aggravated. I basically had to put on a real doscile act to get released. 

The experience though was heartbreaking to see. Many of the patients were elderly with dementia or youth with drug addictions. And due to covid there was no outdoor time. Couldn't even smoke a cigarette. I worked out the whole time like a convict because I would have gone crazier if I didn't.

Tldr: The mental health system in North America needs a serious overhaul.",25Jun2020,1
8,"My girlfriend (26) and I (F, 21) are both very depressed and suicidal, the two of us having very traumatic pasts and really little faith in the system or in other people. However, her faith in recovery is a lot less than mine. I've been diagnosed with ASD, BPD, Social anxiety, body dysphoria, body dysmorphia and a whole other cocktail of things ive kinda just stopped remembering over time. She's never been properly diagnosed/pretty much avoided it her whole life but we are pretty certain she has ASD too. Very suspect traits- Naive, can't go off routine, socially awkward, has always been described as 'weird', special interests, etc- 
 I don't think I'd ever find someone else I have more love, patience, compassion or dedication towards. She's my everything and I don't think I'd last without her. So wherever she ends up, I'm pretty sure I'll follow suit. I know it's not healthy but we're only really ever happy when we're together and I just- I don't know what I'd do without her. She.. can get pretty manic. She doesn't feel like she can ever fit in to this world but I can tell she wishes deep down she could. She loves fantasy and anime and wishes deeply she could have that kind of hope and enthusiasm- Even applying that sort of logic to the real world. She's so nice, but so easily hurt and I want to protect her so badly. I want her to know that it's ok and that we can have our own happiness but- She's convinced that only on the other side she can be happy and that all she wanted would be right there. 
I would tell her someone all this who can help her, like authorities but- I don't want her to lose trust in me. I know if I did this, there'd be no repairing it and from that point I don't know what I'D do. I want to fix this. 
Anyway- Now for the relevance of all this. We made a suicide pact. 
I want us to be okay and to recover but I also know if I said this, she'd feel betrayed. I don't want her to feel alone ever again. What am I meant to do? What can I even say? We're poor and have nothing. I wish I had the money to take her on journeys and keep her love of live still vibrant- But I have nothing but words and myself to offer. I don't know what to do and I'm panicking. I'm sorry if my writing is incoherent, I really am. Comment if anything needs clarification- thank you. Advice and input is very needed- please be kind.",25Jun2020,1
9,"I've been in and out of therapy for years, off meds for a while now, due to the pandemic i dont really have access to a therapist anyway but even before it started i didnt have the energy to go to therapy. 

It takes so much effort to get out of bed, to shower, to eat, to study or watch a movie or read a book or talk to people or literally do anything, even things i enjoy. I have the motivation and drive and i wanna do so many things but I just can't. 

I'm exhausted simply by existing and even the smallest actions require me to vegetate and recharge for hours, and I hate it, it makes me even more miserable. I just wanna function normally, or as close to normal as i can get.

11,"So, there are a bunch of problems i’m gonna go into here. So it’s kind of a rant of glowing thought but i welcome any and all guidance. 

I don’t feel like talking to people at the moment. My friends i’ll see their message and ignore it until the end of the day, i would ignore it forever if i knew it wouldn’t hurt them. I love my friends but the motivation isn’t there, i feel added stress from it, to say the right things, to not offend, to seem normal. Which brings me to my next point:

i feel like i don’t ever know the right way to be. An example: sometimes before replying to people instagram posts or replying to their comment on my post I go to other posts and look at the way other ppl talk, and use that as a guide for myself. It’s weird, but i do similar things when texting my friends in group chats. I’m always scared that i’m not normal or in saying the wrong things, and this is a pretty recent thing too, I would say. And sometimes I will message my friends without doing any of that or overthinking but then i worry that they are judging the way i sound or think that it’s inauthentic. (this may be from my social anxiety but my actions feel very different in comparison to what i know about that and how i’ve been in the past) and i truly can’t tell if it is inauthentic. i sometimes don’t remember who i am or how i act. it’s like i’m being detached and robotic.

I also have moments where i can’t tell whether i want to do things bc i like them or if i only want to do things because they are cool and i want to be cool.",25Jun2020,1
12,"I in depression is already for 3.5 years and think it's finally started to affect my brain. Recently I couldn't think straight, couldn't make long term plans, just like a vegetable lying down and thinking wtf I've done with my life. I poured all of my money in study overseas thinking it would change my life and help me run from a society that I despising, Now I'm studying that I find somewhat interesting ( Because really interesting me professions are paid shit cause you know life is fun) is hard to land a job, all friend I've lost then ended high school 3 years ago. Most of them are alcoholics or drug abusers at this point, the small portion that don't are so bad as people that I couldn' t stand even remembering about them. My parent's left me alone after I turned 18. I lived with my Grand Mother which helped me to get to my dream. She sold her last property to pay my study and get me to overseas (God help her soul, she died 1 year ago) I was rejected in visa twice, but finally received it on the third time. I didn't talk with any people at this point maybe for over a half a year I think, The only people I chat are cashiers at Wallmart. I've lost any interest at this point, no goal, no hobby. So, in short, I'm poor, with foreseeable f#cked up future, completely alone with a lost life interest. I've tried to suppress these feelings for all these years, but I guess that this is it. It's finally started affecting my life. IF SOMEONE GONNA ASK TO GET BACK TO MY HOME COUNTRY, I would be mad if I could, you see If I come back I would probably either go to the army or go to jail for draft evasion. If I come back, that means that I couldn't reach anything. There is no perspectives, nothing. I would honestly kill myself rather than go back. So I'm on so unstable life situations that I don't even know what to do. I won't even talk about COVID-19, In my life, it's not even a problem, I had a shit much scarier than that. Why I even writing here? I don't know, because I don't think someone would be able to help me. I'm not a hobo who will ask for money, but even if I would what the point. Would anyone give me anything? No. I need to much and I rather die than be a beggar. I honestly thought about suicide many times, but I just can't because I had anything moving me on. Opposite, many factors against me, but I just still going for some reason. If you ask me, I would pay money if someone just killed me, because I don't want to live in this hell. Death would be at least grant me peace. I don't know how many people like me, maybe 1 in 100000000 idk. At this point I'm just lost a draw with life, just was unlucky to be born in poor family and country, completely alone most of the childhood and with no possibility of change it. I do not hate myself, I hate the world that I'm currently In. I am just done with it. I could probably say some tear-jerking shit like ""I'm gay or I'm Black"", but sadly even BLM won't count on me. I'm just average white straight dude. I just wanted to be in peace, I wanted to live a normal life, is it too much to ask? I guess so. Why I'm even writing? Maybe Just want to talk with someone firstly in the first 3 months, maybe just wanted to make myself a note, before finally lost my mind. I'd guess it is what it is. I'm sure this text have a lot of grammar errors, but do I care?  I' awful,but still live. Just why ?

14,"People die all the time. We all will eventually.

My life has been nothing but one big fucking disaster from start to finish, and even now as an adult I still can’t even fucking leave my parent’s house because I got scammed, screwed over, and lied to by everyone I’ve ever met (including family).

I can’t drive (nor get the hours to drive).

I live in a town where everything is a 50-minute walk or longer to get anywhere (and walking is the *only* reliable source of transportation I have).

I work at a dollar store despite being forced by my family to go to college so I could get a better job (which was a complete fucking lie).

I went to college after being forced to go despite telling people my thoughts on the matter.

I’ve never been in nor will have a meaningful relationship, and spent the majority of my life demanding myself to understand and accept that fact.

I am overweight and can’t lose it (regardless of how hard I try).

I have barely-contained anger issues that make my head go fuzzy whenever I begin to unravel.

My teeth are crooked and cannot be fixed.

I chafe every day at work to the point where I can barely walk because of my morbid obesity.

I have no morals and only care about money, since every issue I’ve ever had could have been fixed with money if I had any.

I frequently daydream about mutilating myself since the thought of suffering seems to be the only thing that brings me peace of mind.

All I want is to die but can’t, and every time I bring it up I’m told that I shouldn’t feel that way and that I’m not alone, as if that could even possibly change my thoughts on the matter.

I have been hospitalized and gone to several therapy sessions, but those didn’t help and they never will.

I do not want to be helped. No good could come from it.

Why am I not allowed to embrace my true desire? It’s not anyone else’s fucking issue if I croak or not, and frankly I’m done being told what I can or cannot do.",25Jun2020,1

I sleep all day and then go up to eat something. Nothing is fun to do. My gf have been a lot stressed lately and it’s effecting my mental health pretty bad.

23,"What's wrong with me? It seems like everyone else has this good memory and awesome conversational skills, where they'll retell stories from their lives and they'll recall them perfectly and with a lot of detail. I can't. I remember events from my life vaguely, I remember ""what happened"", but without so much detail. I also have trouble remembering the chronological order of events. I have always had trouble ""telling stories"". When people ask me ""So, what happened at that event?"" I mostly reply with a one sentence answer. ""This happened"". 

I also see these memories as ""still pictures"". Such as, if I try to recall a camping trip, I see a picture of tents. If I try to recall a conversation, I see the person's picture in my head and a concept of what was discussed. Is this normal? Or do people actually see their memories like a movie? Don't get me wrong, I can still ""imagine things moving"", and I can force myself to remember something ""in motion"", but it would be more like a GIF that lasts a few seconds... so it's not natural for me to have memories that are in motion, they're more like a collection of GIFS and still pictures that sometimes get scrambled out of order... not too much out of order, but like, things that happened regarding the same ""concept"" or event might get scrambled out of order. Such as, did this happen before that? I know it happened at the same event, but which one came first? It's like my memories are a scrapbook of photos grouped together for certain events, and sometimes I forget the order of which I grouped the photos... dont get me wrong, I can imagine things moving, so I can imagine a story in my head... Imagine, but not remember... 

I also forget things that happened in TV shows if I haven't watched them in a while. Like,I'll remember the ""main parts"" (but even that, not always! If it's an insignificant tv show then i wont even remember the main parts!), but I might forget the chronological order or the details. 
I never thought I really had memory problems... I don't forget important events that are supposed to happen, such as birthdays and whatnot. 

I've never been diagnosed with anything. But I always knew that I had an extremely difficult time retelling events and stories, unless I practice beforehand and really try to memorize that event. I used to do this in high school where I would literally practice retelling events in my head so that when I tell them to my friends it's more than just a one word sentence of ""i did this"". Heck, even now I catch myself automatically practicing in my head retelling an event right after it happens, so I'm prepared to talk about it. 

I mean, I won't ""forget"" any important things though, and if people remind me of things that happened, I'll remember it (the exception being some TV shows where I might forget most things). Is there something wrong with me?",25Jun2020,1
25,"I (17) am currently having a hard time with the mental condition I am in. Its almost like I’m becoming the carefree, unaware, unenthusiastic, numb girl I was a couple years ago and I hate it. It has started the same exact way, it feels like I put my life on autopilot and continue on with my day being zombie-like and not thinking anything of it. Days turn into weeks, and weeks turn into months without me even realizing it.

A couple months ago I was talking to my best friend and telling her that (a couple years ago) I felt like I was almost co-existing, and I was completely unaware of it and didnt even stop to question it while it was all happening. I say co-existing because if you ask me what I was doing during that half of a year, just 2 years ago, I would tell you “I cant remember anything, but I know I was going to school every weekday”. Its like all of my memories faded, and melted together so I cant even pick out one specific one from that point in time.

I keep my room damn near spotless all the time, bed always made, everything’s always organized, nothing on the floor, all of my belongings put away in a specific place. I never have an issue with my room looking messy in any way, but today I stopped, looked around and got overwhelmed with how messy I let it get. I cant even believe I let myself slip like this. The crazier part is, I cant remember how long its been looking like this. This is very important because seeing my room as messy as it is, I realized that I’ve been on autopilot for who knows how long.

This scares me because I may be aware of it now, but when I go to sleep and wake up tomorrow will I stay snapped out of it? Because I feel like Im gonna go straight to continuing life feeling like a zombie and not realizing it. Im scared because I actually have people to lose in my life right now. I have an amazing boyfriend and an amazing best friend, and I cant imagine losing them. But if I turn into the carefree, numb person I once was, isn’t that a huge possibility? Especially with isolating, and not reaching out because I feel like no one cares and I start to feel unwanted. I know it all to well and the outcome of this terrifies me.

Ive been so down bad that I have zero motivation. I have started about 5 projects that I want to finish, but I just cant even get up and find the courage to pick one of them up. Ive been struggling with finding a job too. It feels almost impossible. I just dont know what to do.",25Jun2020,1

29,"Last year, I experienced two months of terrifying hallucinations, paranoia, and insomnia. It was difficult for me to understand what was happening to me; I'd never experienced psychosis, so my first thought was that the hallucinations, voices and images, were real, and I was convinced I was going to die. After calling the police three times, and scaring the crap out of my family, I was taken to the hospital. I would describe the mental ward as some mixture between prison and kindergarten, and I had a mixed experience there. I ended up on medication with the diagnosis ""Unspecified Psychotic Disorder"". After I got out of the ward, I started seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist, who gave me the additional diagnosis of Depressive Disorder. I hated being on medication and tried to go off of it, but of course once I went off of it the terrifying hallucinations were back in full force. I have since resigned myself to taking it, and I'm in full cooperation with my mental health team. It's been eight months since I first developed symptoms and things are pretty stable. I do still feel paranoid at times despite the medication.

My family have been supportive the whole time, but I'm finding that they are in denial about my diagnosis. When I talk about it with my dad, he scrunches his nose and waves it off (he doesn't want to talk about it). I was once having a conversation with my mom about me being psychotic, and she said ""you're not psychotic"", and I had to remind her that my diagnosis is literally ""Psychotic"" disorder. My brother is visibly uncomfortable if I bring it up. It's not hard to see why I have stopped talking to them about it and now only take those discussions to my therapist.

I haven't told any of my friends or extended family. Why? Well, it's the stigma. I've been noticing that every single depiction of someone who experiences psychosis is excessively negative. I've never seen a depiction that seems to convey the reality of what hallucinations are like for a sufferer of psychosis. I'm afraid anyone I tell will see me differently and think of me as being a ""psycho"" like they see in the movies. I'm also afraid of being intercepted by cruel people. I'm scared of never being taken seriously again. At the same time, I feel this is now an important part of my life. This is something that I have to contend with day in and day out, something that affects my ability to focus or have fun. I've realized that I wont be able to fulfill some of my dreams, but that others are still attainable. It has given me a different perspective on my life. Part of why I'm writing this post is because I feel like I need to come out and say ""I experience psychosis."" I want to tell my friends. I want to tell my extended family. But every time I go to do so, I get stopped by the thought, ""Do they really *need* to know?""",25Jun2020,1

32,"F/23 

When I am around my family (especially parents, at their home) I get an extremely weird feeling. It’s almost like anxiety, but I also feel sad and very uncomfortable.

Throughout my teenage years, we definitely had a hard time coexisting. There have been many instances where I feel unloved, unwanted, etc. They have always provided for me financially and are there for big moments, birthdays, sporting events and everything else similar. They have always made me feel bad when I point out things that they do that I feel hinder our relationship. 

I also want to make it clear that this specific feeling used to happen when I was a child. I remember the first time feeling it, in the middle of the night while I was watching a cartoon that involved a family. 

In short, when I am around them I get a very specific, anxious, sick feeling sometimes. It is amplified when they are being nice or we are doing “family things”. This includes eating dinner with just us, watching tv together, driving somewhere in the same car. I get this feeling when I watch television or movies and see families doing these things. Saying I love you is very hard. It’s just weird. We are on good terms now, and very rarely get into arguments. I just don’t want to spend alone time with them, and I don’t want to talk about our relationship as a family. 


I have always felt like something traumatic may have happened when I was younger that I can’t uncover. I am not sure where this feeling stems from, but I just wanted to know if anyone felt the same way. It is very hard to express through words, but I feel like if there’s anyone out there who gets this specific emotion/reaction, they will be able to relate right away. 

Thanks in advance for responses 💛",25Jun2020,1
33,"Tl;dr gone through a lot in the span of a year, F [17] overwhelmed mentally and needs advice on how to sort thoughts and think positively.

For anyone going through anything. It gets better. I promise. I'm not perfect rn, but I never thought I could get here, and here I am!

A few months ago, one of my friends that I've known for a few years took her own life. I was shaken and the whole school community shifted drastically in response, peppering students with mental health resources. Not long after, another suicide by a closer friend. Following this, I collapsed. Isolated myself from friends and family, couldn't deal with school work, watched my 95+ average slowly decline. I felt trapped and overwhelmed. Exam season came and went, and I cried every hour, struggling emotionally. Fortunately, I maintained a mid-90 average, although it felt a million times harder to do so. (The reason why I bring up marks so much is because my school is very competitive and concerned about university acceptances)

As if the world wasn't done slapping me in the face, my grandma was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer (terminal), and was given six months to live. Fortunately, she fought the odds and is alive today, but her condition is deteriorating. As a result, I'm responsible for most of the shopping, chores, cooking, etc. in my household as my parents deal with work and caring for my grandmother. My grandma and I are very close, regardless of a language barrier, as I'm her only granddaughter and she's always spoiled me. I haven't seen her in months, as her weak immune system means that she can only be in contact with my mom, her primary caregiver. I cook food/make gifts for my mom to bring her, but the guilt of not doing more/being there for her is weighing on me.

I started seeing my guidance counselor and school psychologist privately, keeping it from my school friends. After seeing a doctor, I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I'm only 17. To this day, most of my friends are unaware of how bad of a state I was in, and I feel bad about bringing it up because it seems attention-seeking.

I had ""tantrums"", heavy mood swings, was pessimistic. I had suicidal thoughts and self harmed (clean for half a year). Thus, right before the quarantine, my bf and best friend of multiple years broke up with me. He claimed to need to focus on his own life and happiness, and called me too immature and sad for a relationship. Regardless, he cut ties for multiple months after without any thought of checking up on me, and asked another girl out a mere week after the breakup. In all honestly, I wasn't devastated by the breakup, it's just high school, and I assessed the red flags that he showed during the relationship. Throughout the whole relationship, I thought that I was at fault and a burden, and that I was undeserving of friends. He further encouraged that indirectly, and provided little support, regardless of knowing my condition. It took me until after the relationship to feel like I wasn't in the wrong for struggling, but I still feel insecure. 

On May. 19, 2020, my grandfather (my mom's dad) suffered a heart attack and passed away. He was in great physical shape, was only 70 something, and no one expected it. I felt like I needed to be strong, watching my mom sob for weeks, and have to deal with legal paperwork. Thus, it took me a long time to process and grieve. 

A blessing in disguise, I've improved a lot without my bf, with my best friends, and with a less stressful environment (online school provided less work) during the quarantine. 

I had another scare when my best girl friend since birth was sent to the ER for a suicide attempt. I was so unaware of her depressive episode, as I focused on myself, and feel awful now. Huh. This story seems ridiculously fabricated, but I promise it's not.

 Thankfully, I'm in a better mental state now and feel supported by my peers. I've slept at 3am due to school and emotional weight for a year now, and I'm trying to fix it now!

Uncertainty for the future and university is also there, although I'm prioritizing my family right now. I have very loving parents and an older brother (who is unaware of my past and mental state), and I've tried talking to my parents, but they don't understand due to the generation gap.

I'm hoping for support and advice on how to deal with this mentally, as I feel overwhelmed. I chose to write here anonymously because I feel weak due to all of this, and I don't want be mistaken as seeking pity. I'm not expecting much response, though. Writing this took a load off of my shoulders already.",25Jun2020,1

My mom is a therapist, but doesn't take me seriously and blames everything on me being overweight/not excersing enough. I really just need a breakthrough right now. I don't think my mom would let me go to a mental hospital because she doesn't take it seriously, and part of me doesn't want to leave home either but what other choice do I have?

39,"I'll try to keep this as short as I can. Basically, four years ago, I was trying to write some sort of creative writing piece for school, and I had to center it around some kind of internal conflict in the character. I remember looking up unpopular mental illnesses, and finding some results for Boanthropy. If you have clinical anxiety like me, I recommend that you stop here and get on with your life, because this thing **traumatized** me. Ever since I looked that up, I have always been terrified of ""catching"" the illness, because simply falling asleep and having a particular dream can cause you to get stuck in a hypnotic loop, wherein you believe that you're a cow. I really don't want to talk about it anymore, but this night I'm especially terrified of going to bed, because I've felt really tired today, and my brain has been foggy, which for some reason freaks me out. Can somebody bring me back to my senses if that's even possible, because my parents have heard about my ridiculous theories way too many times.

40,"Covid-19 has not made things easy for me. 

Lost my student job that helped me pay for my college education, had to undergo a wisdom teeth removal that left me anxious about recovery, I have my exams in a month and failing them would mean that I will need to wait for 1 year just to take an attempt again, and I have not seen my family in person in almost 2 years.

I used to be so sad about things, and recently I even climbed onto the balcony of my student apartment and contemplated jumping off and just ending it. 

Although after talking to some of my friends I realized something today. 

I had a student job to help pay for college when most people don't .... I was able to undergo expensive medical procedure for free because I am currently in a country that encourages public health insurance... I have the opportunity to study and work in a world that is not fair to all... I have family waiting for me on call/video call whenever I am depressed...

In a world when people are losing their lives and their loved ones lives, I am lucky to be healthy and so is my family. Even if my education gets delayed, even if I lose my current job..... I live to fight another day, I live to see another sunrise. 

I am not trying to brag or anything, I just wanted to share a train of thought that gave me sudden hope, when I was crazy suicidal. 

I used to think that the sadness and depression I hold in my heart needs to be supressed, but I have come to accept it. I have opened up with friends that I am not the cheerful, confident and bold person they see... I am the meek, self-doubting, self-hating, emotional wreck that would give up hope at slightest discomfort in life.

Munchausen syndrome is usually thought to be rooted in attention-seeking behavior, but I definitely didn't do it for attention - I think it is a way of controlling my emotions, like self-harm. I also have a lot of feelings of inadequacy so illness gives me a physical representation of that. 

The issue I am struggling with right now is that all the traditional means of treating mental health - therapy, medication, support groups, etc actually feed my munchausen cravings and make it way worse. Playing the role of patient in this limited capacity makes me want to act out in other ways. The fantasies get really intense after an AA meeting or therapy session, which has led me to stop doing both.

I was always very smart, very emotional, and very perceptive. Incredibly self aware for someone my age. However, my fatal flaw is that I am criminally shy and have immense social anxiety. I don't know if it's something more than that though. I am realizing I have certain behaviors that I have used to avoid big sensory things, like I avoid looking people in the eye at all costs, I avoid bright lights at all costs. Wearing sunglasses and plugging my ears at the same time significantly boosts my ability to be calm and to actually be able to focus. Finally, I optically have almost perfect vision, yet I can't seem to perceive depth at all anymore, I feel too overwhelmed to do so on a daily basis and it hurts my eyes to try / when I try my hardest to bend my eye muscles to focus.

The wedding is in a few weeks I want nothing more than to be there for her wedding and I’ve been trying so hard to not let any of my own crap pour over into her wedding plans since it’s obviously been stressful and she’s had to deal with her fair share of crap. But a few days ago I had a big nervous breakdown, and I know it’s only been a few days but I can’t help but dread doing anything now. I have had self esteem issues/self image for most of my life but I’ve always been pretty good at faking my way through it. But it started getting severe a couple years ago. I think I know why, but it’s not something I’ve openly talked about to many. My friend who’s wedding I’m going to is vaguely aware but I’m not very open about that stuff in general but she knows I have struggled with mental health stuff in the parking but just doesn’t know a lot or the details. But I’m scared especially in this situation if I was to mention any of my issues my friend would get upset with me. She’s already had so much crap happen during her wedding planning and events and I think this is not the time to throw more crap her way. But the whole nervous breakdown was triggered by a photo her mother posted of us at her bridal shower and it was very unflattering and I hate to be vain, like part of it is that I again have this self image issue where I detest everything about myself inside and out, WHICH I know is unhealthy and it’s a constant battle. I try to not be that way but ya. Anyways, I saw this picture and my heart sank and I not only detested what I saw but I thought about all the people that knew or know me saying things about it. And it just kept running through my mind over and over again. How it probably gives some people satisfaction to see me look bad etc. And I just broke. I think everything I’ve held in just came and hit me so hard and I sat there for days thinking “is this what’s going to motivate me to get better or is this what’s going to kill me.” And the logical part of my brain was trying to fight years worth of crap and it was one of the toughest battles that I’m still trying to fight right this second. And I just am so worried about being at her wedding in front of people. Especially people I know don’t like me, or be in pictures. And I hate that I’ve turned into this.... irrational weak person. I shouldn’t be scared to be in a picture or in a wedding, a year ago I wouldn’t have had this issue even and I know I should just suck it up push myself to do it for her but the battle I’ve been fighting everyday has completely exhausted me. I just have been in such a dark place, I’ve slowly isolated myself and the more isolated I am the worse everything gets. I think I’ve almost pushed myself too much with her wedding trying to make her happy and not taking time for myself and not speaking up about even the money issues I’ve been having because of the wedding stuff. I’m too ashamed to even admit that I can barely pay for rent and food right now because I’ve had to drop so much for everything. And then all this happened... I’m just having a hard time acting right now. We all wear masks and I just am too tired to put mine on right now I guess.... My mums been helping me a lot and we’re looking into getting me into therapy which I’ve probably needed to do years ago but I can’t get in before the wedding but I’m terrified to go. Part of it is the not wanting to be in front of people and again, the pictures. But I’m scared I’m just not ready to handle it with what I just went through. And am really still going through.

55,"I am fairly new but using a throwaway for my own reasons so please forgive me. I am a teenager still, I am tired, and this is way too long to read all of it but feel free to read all of it. For impatient people like myself(I understand) here is a summary: 

I am seeing a therapist for the first time in a while and have no clue what to do. I appreciate any help or advice I receive! 


The long stuff and partial explanation:

I(15F) am going to see a therapist. I am very nervous but excited. I haven’t been in a good place lately and needed some help. I have seen different doctors over the years for different medical issues. They have all pushed for me to see a therapist because I was showing… red flags. My parents have always been adamant that if you see a therapist something is wrong with you or your parents failed as parents to you. The motto my parents have is “put it in a box and move on”. The motto was the only comfort my parents offered because their parents were toxic people. The motto is what kept them going through life. Lately, I have been having a hard time with keeping all these negative thoughts and actions to myself. I get shut down whenever I try to talk to them, seek their comfort, or ask for help with everything I am experiencing. My parents realized only recently as directly after an argument they couldn’t find me for hours. It’s pathetic but I felt comfortable and safe but I hid in the dark, in a cramped nook I found in the basement. I let everything out, I switched between panic attacks and crying that made me feel horrible. I felt horrible in those moments as in during the panic attacks I was sure I was going to die because I couldn’t breathe from the anxiety. I am not trying to exaggerate but in these moments it felt so real like “this is it, I am going to die with so many regrets and I will never be forgiven”. However I felt horrible crying because I felt like an awful person as I argued with my parents. I argued when they were right yet I pushed my side of the argument so hard they may never forgive and I have lost their trust/love/pride in me. When I got everything out and felt like I would be ‘ok’ to face people I got out and was confronted by my parents. They agreed I needed to see someone because I was scaring them with how I have been lately. I am excited, almost happy, that I can at least talk to someone about everything and they will listen. I am still a little scared and apprehensive maybe too hopeful but I want help. I also have some questions. I saw a therapist once but we had two or three meetings and I didn’t feel comfortable with them with my situation. I can’t remember exactly but I think they threatened my parents with hospitalizing because I had gone to far with starving myself. The meetings were supposed to be strictly for cognitive behavior therapy(right term?) and not exactly spill-your-guts-to-them sort of thing. The entire time my parents were pushy to know what we talked about when they couldn’t be in the room. They would hold this over my head and try to figure out/try to get me to talk about our discussions. They tried to weirdly insert themselves in meetings and mention stuff that they “thought needed to be talked about”. It was stuff like a dispute my brother and I had or something about issues with school(straight-A student who loves the school, no record of any incidents, loved by all my teachers, and had a good friend group).


Does anyone have advice about what to talk about during meetings? How do meetings with a therapist typically work? Since I am 15 what would happen if I talk about my suicidal thoughts, the starvation, or hurting myself?(Is it a “safe space”? Would they tell my parents? Do they need to tell someone about it ) Once again, since I am still 15, what can I do if I don’t want my parents there when I talk to the therapist? Is it ok to talk to the therapist by myself? What happens if my parents ask the therapist what we talked about during our meetings? Would I be prescribed medication if necessary to help me with everything I am feeling and feel better in general like some of my doctors have said(They aren’t and don’t typically work with therapists)? How often do I meet with the therapist? How long are the meetings? How do I know/find someone I am comfortable with or just have that feeling they feeling that I feel alright with them? 


I have more questions but my phone is dying and I may have spent two hours and a half writing this way too late at night. I will take any advice so I at least know what to expect and what I should be doing.",25Jun2020,1
56,"Hello reddit, 
Recently I noticed my younger sister, 17, has lost weight very rapidly. She was already fairly small and lost about 20 pounds within a month or so. About a year ago she was put on depression medication because of an episode she had that resulted in her being hospitalized. The weight loss didn’t happen until about 3 months ago, though. Has anyone had a family member go through this or has anyone gone through this themselves? We have had her take blood tests to see if anything is wrong but they come back fine and doctors keep saying it has to do with her mental health. She doesn’t eat consistently and has trouble maintaining her appetite, but she does have ups and downs and her weight fluctuates. She also has other symptoms such as dizziness and nausea. Any advice is appreciated, I would just like to know how to better help her and what could be causing this since her doctors haven’t been much help. Sorry for the long post.

63,"Hey all! First off, I want to preface this with saying that yes, I'm in therapy and have doctors, so I'm not looking for medical advice - this is more of an academic / advice question. The problem is I don't know how to tell people what I have if they ask, without a long explanation like this. This is a little long, but I need to explain my point...

So, I have been diagnosed with major recurrent depression and Dissociative Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (I think the DSM 5 has a different name for this now?) I've been hospitalized before, and I've had a few therapists over the course of my life - but what I would consider my most serious problem is ""low self-esteem.""

Now, when I say this I don't mean routine low self esteem... it is extreme. I even had a mental health professional once tell me that he had never seen someone with a lower opinion of themselves than me.

For example, I've many times referred to myself as ""evil,"" ""the worst person in the world,"" and ""too stupid to live."" I can't bring myself to look in mirrors because seeing my reflection can cause me to start crying or to get physically ill. If I cook food, I'll sometimes immediately throw it out because I hate everything I do. I can't believe someone if they say something good about me. Even though I graduated college with honors (I'm a mathematician) I lie to people and say I was a C student sometimes because I literally can't imagine myself getting good grades, and just assume my diploma is a delusionor something. If I do something at work, I tell others someone else did it because I don't deserve the credit. I'm extremely mean to myself - like, if I make a tiny mistake, I'll starve myself to the point of nearly passing out to ""learn better..."" okay, that's enough examples, I just wanted to give a good picture. 

So recently, my therapist has asked me ""what I like,"" and I seriously don't know how to answer the question. This is how this came up. I told him (in a nutshell) ""I like what whoever is around me likes because my opinions are of no importance whatsoever so I don't even know what those are."" And this is true. I have no idea who I am or what my likes and dislikes are, and I have no idea how to find out because I have no faith in my ability to do so. I don't know where to even begin, or how to start to answer the question. (And I know finding out what he wants to hear sort of defeats the point - but that's my first instinct).

Okay so, my question is... is there a name for this? When I tell people that I have low self-esteem, I'm not sure they understand... (and I listed my current diagnoses for clarity).

Thanks!",25Jun2020,1

At college (or honestly even at home just in my own room), I will literally start panicking and crying if i think about how much i miss my family and vice versa when im home (about my friends). I get attached to objects and associate sentimental meaning with some of them (i dont have a hoarding issue though). i suppose the only damage done is to myself because sometimes i get so overwhelmed about missing and being apart from everything i care about and just panic.

73,"I made a big move a few months ago, right before big rona hit. From a small town to big town. And I was excited, I really was. I wanted everything to change, and I thought I was ready. 

I worked at a fast food restaurant straight out of high school, I was there for three years, was a manager for one, and it was killing me. I was going through some shit with just about every friend I had, whether it was just something in my head, or people growing apart, and it was killing me - so I decided to change everything.

A friend who was already living up here offered me to move up and get an apartment with him, and I did. The week I was going to move up here, my grandmother died. Right after her and my birthday. It’s not that I’m not close with my family, I just never really spent time with them, or enjoyed their company. I was always in my room, doing my own thing. But basically, I’m an asshole.

I’m rambling, but let’s talk about why I’m here now. I don’t know what the hell I’m doing. I don’t have an endgame for life, or even a midgame. I’m just working until I can find something to move on to, but it’s not like I’m looking. I don’t want to commit to school because it’s just not for me, I can’t learn in a setting like that. I’m 2 months behind on rent, since I didn’t have a job from rona and I promised I’d give it to him eventually, but when the hell am I ever gonna catch up? 

Part of me wants to go back home, but then my roommate is stuck up here with his name on the lease - my name never got put on because of weird timings and rona and it’s all just a dumb big puzzle. Like, I could, and it wouldn’t affect me in the slightest - it’s just the dickest thing to do. But even then, what would I do if I moved back down? Live with my mom, who I’ve been working on not living with for 3 years? Go back to absolutely TERRIBLE pay and struggle to pay whatever rent with whoever I’m staying with? 

I left everyone behind, my “sister” (long story) doesn’t really talk to me anymore, even though we said we’d do video calls and still watch our shows together. Even then, she went off to college, so even if I did go back home and visit, I wouldn’t be able to see her. 

I’m not saying I want to die, but I’m not saying I don’t. I just don’t see anything else to do. Nothing I’m doing matters, and I don’t know what I want to do that could matter. I always try to focus on the people I care about, making them happy. That’s why I moved up here, to focus on making ME happy. But now, I think I realize I don’t care about me. It’s fucked, but I really don’t. 

I just feel like if I did just so happen to die, it’d be so much weight off of my shoulders, not having to worry about the future or anyone else anymore. But I know and am completely aware it’d take everyone else down. It’s selfish, I get that - but I never get to be selfish.

I just don’t know what steps to take, where to go next, how to care about ME. I’m asking for help, but I feel like I have no one anymore.",25Jun2020,1
74,"So a group of my buddies had been invited to a party at the house of a girl who I had always thought I was decent friends with. I was confused as to why I wasn't invited when she had been talking to me weeks before about how she planned to have it. Regardless, I still ended up going because we had all made plans before hand and several of my buddies refused to go if they couldn't bring me with them. Anyway, we get to the house, I thank her for letting me come, and start dicking around with my friends. A few minutes later I realize that she seems uncomfortable as all fucking hell and really doesn't seem to want anything to do with me. Rather than saying anything about it, my dumbass decides to completely ignore it and instead continued to just dick around with my friends. Now, all that alone wouldn't be enough for me to bother writing this, it's what happened about and hour later that has me concerned. I'm talking to a buddy while we're all in her pool. She didn't seem to be avoiding me anymore, and was actually in between me and my buddy to some degree. We're talking for about 5-6 minutes all the while she just zones out, when she suddenly decides to splash me. I look at her, ready to splash her back, but I'm met with a soul piercing stare that just screams of, ""fuck you"" and ""don't you dare do it"".

75,"I’ve always had problems in the social scene and keeping friends around even though I would consider myself and extra extrovert. I have never been able to have consistency in my life and I now realize it’s not just with friends but in all aspects in life. The job I have now is the job I’ve ever had the longest and that because the only way to get fired from it from sexual harassment. I’ve only been able to hold down jobs for maybe a year at a time. I never have friends for more than a year at a time. If I manage to have friends or intimate relationships for longer than that, they’re usually toxic. Last year I went to rehab for drugs and alcohol. I’ve been through three therapist and three sponsors and I’m done going to AA because I have my grievances with their processes. I’ve been looking for a promotion in my job (I work for the government so it’s there is an abundance of them) and I’m starting to think that somehow my personality or communication style has something to do with me not being able to move forward. I’ve moved four times in the last two years. I’m educated and I’m really smart and I can do anything I put my mind to. The problem is, I never stick to anything. I have ADD. I don’t have any hobbies because I will obsess about something for a few months and then move on to the next thing. I can work on a car, I taught myself to ply piano, I know how to do make up and hair, Im athletic and know about nutrition and can understand science and math if I practice it and I understand the human brain and the concept of nature vs nurture very well. I’m not trying to iamverybadass myself I’m just trying to give some context. I’m in therapy and I take medication. I meditate, I’ve tried reaching out to people, I have pets. I don’t have a lot of family. Basically my parents. My brother doesn’t want anything to do with me for no particular reason that’s how he’s always been since we were Kids. I tried making friends in AA and I couldn’t. I think to myself maybe I’m not trying hard enough but then I think I dont remember  anyone making an effort to reach out to me when I reached out to others. I journal, I try to do the right thing even tho lately it’s been hard. I try to do selfless things. I recently signed up to do volunteer work for habitat for humanity and I got a message saying to check back later more opportunities. I make enough money to pay my bills and that’s it. And now my government is taking a pay cut because of everything that’s been happening. I feel like I have tried everything there is possibly to do to better myself and I can’t catch a break. I’m trying not to victimize myself because I did cause a lot of damage in my life because of my drug and alcohol using and I need to fall on my own sword for all of that. But I’ve quit that over a year ago and even without AA I’m still not using and I’m still not getting anywhere in life and probably feel worse than I did before because it seems like my efforts aren’t good enough. I’m not sure what else I can do. Sometimes I think I’m not trying hard enough but after a while, after so much rejection, it’s just hard to stay motivated. I don’t even want to think about dating because I’m definitely not in a position to be doing that but I’m a 34 female and my time is running out. I don’t want to be the crazy cat lady and it’s seems like that’s where my life is heading. I’m missing my calling. Idk how to find it.",25Jun2020,1
76,"In the last few years every time something bad happens I go into a spiral of bad thoughts and start to convince myself my life is ruined. These moments aren’t even really that significant for example someone would make a slightly negative comment about me, my grades drop, or a friend isn’t talking to me as much. On really bad days I even fantasies about killing myself. Although I never get to the point where I will act on those urges. I feel like everyone is better than me and I’m really stupid and incapable. My grades rn r low and I’m about to enter my senior year. I can’t seem to get myself motivated for classes and as a result my grades have been dropping. Even when I do try a little I feel really stupid because I can never understand any of the material while the people around me can. I see myself compared to others and I just feel really embarrassed and hopeless. In a sense I also feel like the people around me see me in this light. These thoughts about my school situation have mainly been a reoccurring trigger for my thoughts and mood to go spiraling down. Although at times I realize that these thoughts r stupid and I should lighten up because life moves on and I still have many other options. I start to feel extremely motivated and completely plan out the rest of my life or try something new like a recipe or quick workout. Although these bursts of motivation don’t even usually pass 3 days. Most of the time i’m just on a scale of negative emotions. I have no one to turn to and I wished I could just have someone I could trust and rely on. I’ve been in this repeating cycle and I don’t know how to get out.

Most of the times I'm very sleepy, and when I lay in bed and everything calms down, I start hearing and feeling my heartbeat, and it draws my attention and I can't (obviously) distract myself with anything from that. The thing is I start feeling fear in every heartbeat as ""I hope this one is not the last"" ""just keep beating"" ""please don't stop"". I know it's all in my head and that hearts don't stop for no reason. (Two cardiologists have told me I have a perfectly normal heart). I am under heavier stress last two years, and I know that's the reason, and I know that the solution is to reduce stress. However that is not an option. I am a MSc student and I have to finish my study. But after that - work. I doubt I will have a lower stress level.

I became an adult, and had to stop seeing my youth therapist. Got an adult therapist. Trying to see about making something of my life. One time she tells me that I shouldn't worry about going back to school or college or getting a career. That I should stay at my dead end job or just go on disability and 'work on myself', because that's how bad my mental health is. I know she didn't mean it like that, but to me it felt like she was telling me to give up. I didn't want to give up. But maybe I should have tried baby steps... Anyways, I stopped seeing her, stopped the meds. I went to adult Ed, working full time. Then college, working full time for most of it. Then I went to a specialty high level course immediately after. There weren't a lot of breaks, not a lot of free time. It was really hard and stressful, and a lot of other areas of my life really suffered. But then I got my dream job, and I thought everything would be better. But it wasn't. I loved the job, but most of the other mechanics were cold to me, especially everyone my age. There were big problems with discrimination, an accident that made this one guy really hostile, and because of that stupid PTI course every one expected more of me than they should have from someone who had never been in a shop before. I always felt like I was a failure, and an outcast. And my home life was worse too. Everything was falling apart, roommates bailing, me realising how toxic and unhealthy my relationship was and it falling apart. I had been doing so good at handling the stress and getting through so I could accomplish things, but at some point it was just too much. My mental health got worse and worse, and my physical health suffered from the constant stress. I hated going to work because they hated me. And I hated me. I got fired for sickness absences, fought it and won. But I couldn't bring myself to go back to work there because I had messed everything up so bad already. So I lost my dream job. Then I was on disability for a while, then unemployed, and now I'm back at my stupid dead end job. So maybe that therapist was right. Maybe I should have just given up back then. At least then I wouldn't hate myself for ruining everything I worked so hard for. ",25Jun2020,1

92,"I had a lot of anxiety related issues when I was a very young child (had it young, diagnosed in middle school, still treating well into college). I always thought they were fairly normal but apparently not. I’m beginning to believe that they might have crossed a line into frequent anxiety induced delusions? It could’ve also just been normal childhood imagination mixed with anxiety though. 

My two biggest ones were related to my room. The most normal fear was that, if I didn’t sleep with all my stuffed animals, they’d be so angry that they’d try to kill me. My stuffed animals weren’t really comforting for me because of that fear, keeping them around was more of a necessity. I’d have frequent nightmares about them or I’d imagine seeing them move out of the corner of my eye. 

My other and significantly less normal fear was about my floor. My floor was carpeted and I was SO sure that there were things living in the threads. I was TERRIFIED of standing on my floor. I could imagine a wave of tiny mites crawling up my leg if I were to stand on the threads for more than a few seconds. Because of this fear, I used to leave items strategically placed around my room. This way, I could play a sort of “The floor is lava” to and from my bed so I never had to touch the carpet. I don’t remember when this fear stopped bothering me as much, but I think it tapered off around 11 or 12.

I have been trying to remember to practice CBT to change my natural internal dialogue but I forget more often than not. It seemed to come to a sort of dead end anyway. Ok so, I have this and that defective beliefs, I can fight the negative thoughts. It all gets so tiring. The outside world is too powerful in it's reinforcement of my negative beliefs. Pretending the world isn't the way it is doesn't make it be different. Just explaining all the bs as positives is unconvincing. And it feel like every experience, interaction with others, or even just time passing is like tiny little nails in my coffin that will eventually convince to say fuck it and just turn this whole thing off.

I have tried therapists before. The last one charged me an extra $166 during my $240 intake because I casually mentioned that I had read a book on BCT. She called it a half hour of psychotherapy. I think it was out of spite bc she was annoyed that I kept talking about my problems while ""look, I just have to fill out these forms and answer these questions"" her tone was clearly annoyed.

The one before that charged me $100hr to chat. I was a sucker for having someone to talk to and kept that up for two months before I got sick of her telling me I'm wrong about everything.

The one before that just wrote me a refill every time for a variety of prescriptions that I don't recall doing anything.

100," Don’t we all wish that mental illness had evident physical symptoms like cold, flu, fever, or maybe red eyes, yellow nails, blue lips, pink earlobes, swollen ankles, and ache in the knee, probably similar more? Sadly, adverse mental health does not exhibit any clear symptoms that can be treated by a regular doctor. Today, the pain is deep, engraved, and blatantly settled in our hearts of the lives we all have lost to depression, self-hurt, self-harm, suicides, and intended accidents. As a community, we would like to come forth and discuss the matter up close and clearly with you all. Mental health is important.

hello to the person reading this, I've posted a bit on this chat I think? 

but yeah I've been seeing a therapist lately and through talking with her I talked about how whenever I want to do something but my friends want something else I always feel guilty for not wanting to do their thing and then I start to think if I'm a bad person for wanting to do something else or thinking different and then my therapist said that I should try and consider myself more but I don't really know what to think of it, like that feeling will always come in no matter what and I terrible at deciding what I want for myself and I don't know why

113,"I was on a medicine for my bipolar for the last 2-3 years and it worked extremely well for me. Except that it completely ruined my libido. Like to the point that if I was even touched I recoiled and couldn’t even feel anything. It was almost like my nerves weren’t responding to touch, and i literally had to force myself to have sex and it wouldn’t be until maybe halfway through before I’d sort of get into it. 

Then they raised the price of my meds to about $1,000 for a two month supply out of nowhere. And I was completely devestated and terrified because it really worked well for me besides the libido thing. But there’s no way I could ever afford that. So I had to switch to something else.

Well, I made the switch and it’s been maybe a month or so on the new med and I’m relieved and overjoyed to find that it seems to work even better for me! And it’s made my libido come back tenfold on top of everything! Suddenly I actually INITIATE sex and seem to want to do it almost every night. This is insanely different. I’d maybe force myself into sex once or twice a month on the other meds because it was so difficult for me. This is seriously a huge deal to me and I’m SO happy.

119,"So I'd say overall I don't have super low self esteem.   I know I'm a good person, a good friend, I'm funny, intelligent, loyal, etc.  I'm not perfect, but I'm usually well liked at work, I have friends, I'm good.  However, I'm single and I have been for a very long time because of a super shitty relationship that ended very badly and left me with a lot of baggage that I've never really been able to get past, related to multiple topics, which just makes it harder because it's not any one thing.  It's trust issues and self esteem and sexual hang ups, non of which have any easy fixes.  I have confidence that I would be a good girlfriend, but I have absolutely no confidence in my ability to attract men.  Like at all.  And I've tried a lot of different things to help me work on this, but not much has helped.  I tried Tinder, but that mostly just convinced me dudes will stick their dicks in pretty much anything.  I even tried to fish for compliments from a FWB and got ""well, your pussy's great"" as a response, so that was super not helpful.  I am not a warm and fuzzy person at all, so inspirational quotes and shit annoy the fuck out of me, but I tried when I was in a good place to make notes of compliments I've gotten, and things I like about myself, and I try to look at that whenever I start feeling down.  Sometimes it helps, but sometimes I'm so low I can't find my way out of it.  I call this my death spiral of depression.  These happen every few months, but between them, I'm usually in a pretty good place even with my insecurity and low self-esteem about this one thing.  Pretty much nothing else has ever triggered a death spiral.  Not fights with friends or family, not people I know dying, not work shit, not failing out of grad school, nothing.  Only rejection from the opposite sex gives me this problem.  Talking with friends and my sisters and having everyone act like I'm insane for that insecurity just makes it worse because now I feel like I can't talk about it with anyone because they just spend the whole time saying how I feel isn't true, right, correct, whatever.  Anyways, I really want to date and find someone, but every rejection is just soul crushing and puts me in such a dark place and I don't know how to keep doing it.  I don't know how to get past this insecurity.  I don't even know how to work on it because I don't think anything will every convince me I'm wrong other than being in committed relationship where I feel loved.  Like if you love me, you won't care that I'm a 4 at best.  But how do you get there when your insecurity is stopping you from dating?  And I hate that this makes me so sad.  I am an introvert, so I'm honestly pretty happy alone a good chunk of the time, I'm just finally getting lonely and want a partner.  But I feel like this shouldn't affect me so much and that just makes me super self critical, which lends itself to another death spiral of depression.  I honestly don't consider myself depressed because I am happy with so much of my life, but this one area makes me cry and has in the past made me self harm (purely cutting to use physical pain to distract from emotional pain, not to die) and has me having those thoughts again, and just puts me in such a bad place.  Why is this the only thing that just kills me and has the power to overshadow every other aspect of my personality and self?  How do I even get past this?  Does anyone have things that worked for them to work on poor self-image/self-esteem, particularly when related to physical attractiveness?

Side note: I don't have insurance and live in the US where we don't give a shit about anyone's mental health, so therapy is unlikely to be affordable for me, especially since COVID has caused my monthly pay to be like 25% of what it is normally.

121,"This year I finished my first year of university in the UK. With the pandemic taking affect, my physical time at university was cut short and I moved back home to family in March to finish the rest of my studies online. From this point I didn’t think I would be returning to my university town until late September for second year. 

Although I never wished for something as catastrophic as a pandemic, I was to say the least, a little relieved that my time at university was cut so short. I no longer had to deal with intense feelings of anxiety, depression and loneliness that came from the stress of having to deal with so many new relationships and connections (and the constant fear of losing them and becoming isolated). 

However, by pure chance I ended up texting with a guy from university during lockdown. We have now been texting daily for almost 3 months and speak on the phone regularly. We’re absolutely into each other and because of this, I’m moving back early to our university town in a couple of days so that we can meet. I’m very excited to see him, but terrified of having to live independently again, miles away from family and friends. I just keep thinking of how I’m going to fill my time each day and how will I keep myself sane. I’m scared I’ll just spend all day in bed again, too depressed to get up and too anxious to do anything on my own. This behaviour would then also obviously have a knock on effect on any potential relationship and possibly ruin things for myself. 

So how do I keep myself sane whilst living on my own and prevent myself from spiralling? What can I do to keep myself busy and feeling good about myself and life in general? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I learn a thing that motivational videos are very demotivating in such phase and just talking to people and getting a distraction can help. As failure or depression is not in our hand but much on the environment we are. I came across this app named Chatter pillar i was searching places to ask people for suggestions without being judged and it helped me alot!!

130,"Earlier this week, my brother's wife disrespected our mother, so when she got upset, my brother got angry at mom. Yesterday, they started packing their clothes and announced that they are moving out supposedly today (it got delayed for 3 days due to problems at the house they're going to move into). 

The problem is, my niece (almost 3 yo) has been with us since she was born. And my family took in my sister-in-law's little sister (6 yo) since she was 2. They have been my stress relievers all these years. I play with them when my mental health is not doing well and at most times, they are the only ones that makes me happy when nothing else does. But now they wouldn't be with me anymore and i don't know how to cope up. They are the first ones i look for in the morning and always waits for the time they play with me. Since I found out that they would be moving out, i have been restless and can't sleep or focus. After finally getting some sleep really late last night, i suddenly woke up early in the morning with a heaviness in my chest. I kept on feeling scared, i don't know how my days would be anymore since i do not enjoy doing almost anything when my mental health is in a bad place (which is almost always). I know that they have every right to move out but it is just too sudden and i do not know what to do.

Even my parents are crying and restless since my mom almost only spends her days taking care of my niece and so she is very attached to her.

131,"Hi everyone. I’m a 22F with anxiety and depression. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago (at the time, my psychiatrist said ‘moderate to severe depression and generalized anxiety stemming from severe social anxiety’). I have been on several medications over the last 5 years - Prozac and Propranolol, originally, with Ambien added in later for my tendency to have late-night panic attacks; later, I was prescribed Xanax on an as-needed basis, and switched to Effexor. I stopped the Xanax forever ago - and got off of Effexor in mid-March. It just wasn’t working well anymore, and I was having trouble remembering to get it refilled, and my doctor refused to refill it again without an appointment. I had time off work due to COVID, so I just bit the bullet and stopped taking it.

It took about two weeks for the withdrawals to stop, but I’ve noticed since that the two problems I still have are near-constant sensory overload (I have a cat and three dogs, and the day-to-day sounds they make drive me up the wall, never happened before unless I was actually having a panic attack, now it’s just... almost constant), and, when the sensory overload gets too bad, extreme irritability (mostly just leading to verbal outbursts; I live alone, so it’s not affecting anyone but me). CBD oil has helped, and I’m looking into gummies, but what else can I do to proactively manage the sensory issues and irritability? I don’t like being an angry, irritable person.

It doesn’t seem to be a problem at work when I’m busy and distracted - it just seems to flare up when I’m home and don’t have something I need to be thinking about constantly, if that makes sense.",25Jun2020,1

I thought of a visual that depicts when my AVPD/social anxiety kicks in. Imagine meeting someone new. You talk to them, but they don't talk back . You feel very confident, because this person is shy/quiet, so you feel comfortable talking to them. However, the moment they reply back to you and show you that they are actually very talkative, this is when my AVPD/social anxiety kicks in.

But I still always get kind stuck on the past delusions because I can never forget them. It hurts me mentally so bad. After I smoked a lot of weed I learned to control my delusions over time but sometimes I just experience severe depression and anxiety that almost gets me back to my psychotic like state. Benzos or opioids helped my psychosis because I could forget them a little bit and dissociate more, living more in the moment. I was almost suicidal but it got worse when I got to the psych ward. I once thought it could be something like narcolepsy, because during the delusions I'm usally half aslsep and zoned out. But used to get bullied, got neglected struggling heavily with ADHD/maybe brain injuries, have haring problems and maybe even epilepsy. I used to take drugs but still take them because they keep me sane. I once had heavy ego death on shrooms where I think I forgot how to breathe or stay hydrated. I hate myself so please just insult me. I hope this post is anonymous and the goverment can't read my location and stuff. N-Acetylcysteine helped a bit. Sorry for rambling and wasting your time with my negativity but just wanted to say love yourself, even though it's so hard.. I have severe OCD which is why I'm rambling shit and no doctor really understand me because I'm constantly too anxious and sleepy to be honest, it's as if I live a confusing double life. I just can't calm down. I just want to die but don't wan't to destroy my potential of living a somewhat fulfilling life or disappointing others.",25Jun2020,1

152,"Title says it all really. My life is awful yet it has no reason to be. I have an amazing family, a beautiful and supportive girlfriend, i do well in most things i put my mind to and i'm moving away to uni in september. Despite everything going for me i hate my life. I hate myself. I hate the way i look and the way i act. Its like my life is stuck in a cycle. Its shit but bearable for a long time, then i do something fucking stupid and it gets really bad for a few months, then it gets back to being bearable until the cycle repeats. When i get really bad i cut myself, starve myself, hit things just to feel better. I don't know how it helps it just does. My latest fuckup was yesterday. Prank called someone and gave them a load of abuse for no reason. Childish and pathetic i know. I was that drunk at the time i didnt even remember it when i woke up. Could end up getting into trouble over it yet, who knows? So now we are back to wanting to be dead every minute of my life. I don't deserve to be alive. I keep telling myself that things will get better and they never do. Did over 3 years of therspy that neve helped. Doctors wont pescribe me medication. Ive tried and tried to get better. I really have. Im just so sick of the cycle now. Im wondering how long it will be before i finally stop being a fucking coward and actually kill myself. My family and gf are the only reason i haven't yet. I had a breakdown today and starting cutting myself in front of my mum. I feel awful about that as well. Im a horrible fucking mistake of a person. I know one day ill kill myself. Whether thats it 6 months or 10 years. It'll happen. I dont think really anybody gets how bad it is. Ive been struggling for so long now i can't even remember the last time i was actuslly happy for more than a couple days at a time. I think about how i would kill myself often. If only there was a way to do it without hurting anyone else. Then the pain would finally stop. Thats all i want. Is for it to stop hurting man. I'm only 18 and it gets worse every year. I'm fucking so scared to live my life. Im terrified in  fact. I'm sorry if this has been a ramble. I just needed to get this out somewhere.",25Jun2020,1
154,"Hello everyone, it's my first post but I needed to talk about something somewhere and I found this subreddit. It seemed like a good idea to write a little bit here.

I'm seeing a psychiatrist but I think I just need to vent today and maybe talk to people who can understand me and give me some advice on how to feel better and be better in the future.  
So, I have issues with my anger, because it's way too strong. I can insult everyone but especially my boyfriend because I only talk to him most of the time, but sometimes I can insult his mother, belittle her, and reject everyone. The worst things I can say are ”go kill yourself” etc., and I'm not proud of that at all. I know it's not me but just a problem in my head, but I don't know how to calm it down?

On top of that, I'm constantly afraid of something, particularly dying or being a very bad boyfriend for my love. Because of some trauma, I'm always afraid that one day I will know that my boyfriend was cheating on me all this time, and even though I feel better now, it's still complicated.  
When I'm angry because I'm scared, I can hate everyone and find anything to say they hate me. I just want it to stop, so I was wondering if anyone has any ideas on how to fix it.

that being said, she is worsening my health every day
my mom is the kimd of person that is morlstly fpcused om herself. she doesnr care what others think of her and doesnt care much for others feelings.
lately, sinxe avout last september, things have been hard for her at work. she is angry and stressed and takes it out on me. she yells at me at least once every day, always nitpicks on everything, and she always finds something that i did wrong and yells at me for it for hours. then, shes passive aggressive amd doesnt want to talk to me. then, she comes to me and doesnt even apolpgise, just says 'i dont wanna yell at you, bit things are hard for me, you have to understand' and leaves. she calls me a disappointment, and says im ungrateful and says things like 'well do you pay me for taking care of you?, and makes me feel guilty about evem existing in her presence and living in her home, even yho im 17 and cant move out, even tho i want to. she dpes this evwryday, 24/7, unless im at my fiances, whete she doesnt have control over me, thankfully. she threatens me, for example once she said shes tnrow put my cats if i fifnt do what she said. shes very hypocritical, she doesnt do much at home and wants me and dad to do everything, and her only excise is 'im tired from work', when my dad has even more wprk and has severe back issues. she treats us like trash and then wonders why i dont want to be around her. she makes herself put to be the victim, and o cant talk back because she would be even angrier. at this point, im worried she might start getting physical.
i am diagnosed with clinical depressipn, an anxiety disorder and possibly ptsd (ive been to a doctor with it and i have a therapist, but i havent been diagnosed yet or anything, but i have been through a very traumatic even at the age of 11) so this isnt helping me at all, plus i have a very bad immune system and when i feel terriblr and depressed, i take worse care of myself, so therefore i am more sick, and therefpre she is angry again.
i feel the need to avoif her at all costs. its so hard to please her. every time i ipen my mouth, its wrong. so i avoid her as much as possible, which means i stay out of the hpuse a lot and stay at my fiances, so i dont see my dad much either unfortunately, but he is great anf i love him dearly
i hate her, but i love her. i am absolutely tereified of her at this point, and just thinking about being around her makes me tear up

Or, it feels like they are both faintly mine but are numb-ish. Sometimes I'm uncomfortable enough that I need to wear gloves just so my fingers don't touch each other. 
When I see my arms in my peripheral vision, I don't recognize them as mine. Even looking at them directly they seem foreign. I move them every so often just to check if I still can but this is probably anxiety because I fell asleep on my arm a couple times recently and woke up to it ""dead"". It had no feeling at all and I couldn't move it, it was just weight hanging off of my shoulder.

166,"I was morbidly obese for a decade. I'm not anymore, and once I saw how people treated me so differently I started having a mental breakdown. This was last year; for months I would hurt myself, and it got so bad that I went to the ER several times in a month and later attempted suicide and ended up on the psych ward. I couldn't hurt myself with food anymore, so I hurt myself physically.

Every time I see the r/holdmyfries subreddit on the popular page I get so angry and sad. Just today I saw a post where a woman fell out of the car because she had issues getting out and the comments were so mean. Talking about earthquakes and other mean things because she fell.   
I broke my arm in 2015 when I was still morbidly obese, maybe 250 ish pounds? And when I was in the hospital, in so much pain but trying to make my parents know I was okay by making jokes about loving morphine or just being as positive as I could, some lady had the gall to look at me up and down like I was the scum of the earth. What have I done to you? 

I know now that when I ate I was an emotional eater. I would eat until I was sick because I was sad or mad and then once I was sure I was sick I'd eat more to feel more pain. I decided I didn't care if I lived or died anymore so I had Gastric Bypass Surgery (I am VERY afraid of surgery) and once I had it and lost weight that was when people treated me better like I said and I tried to kill myself because I still saw myself as morbidly obese and disgusting. 

I don't understand WHY people hate obese people? Why can't obese people have clothes that fit, let them have stores that cater to them and let them be promoted like other stores. Why can't they go out without someone being so mean to them or staring? I was hurting MYSELF, not you! Do you want me to apologize for having a disease?

If I hurt someone, it had no impact on me whatsoever, and still doesn't. I've never been able to connect with too many people emotionally, simply because I don't feel emotions as strongly as most. I was also really rebellious, especially as a teen. I have extreme anger outbursts, curse people out and throw around some ruthless insults, punch holes in walls and doors, and don't feel the slightest bit of remorse afterwards. I remember cussing my mom out pretty bad; she was in her room crying and I was standing outside her door looking at her like ""The fuck is wrong with YOU?""

I just feel so alone, even when I'm not physically alone. My depression always comes and goes, but it's comforting because it's the only thing I really know.

174,"Hello everyone, I would like to share what I've been feeling in the past 2-3 months.  


So, it all started like 2 years ago, I think that is when I first experienced a state of .. hopelessness, worthlessness, and the feeling of not wanting to live.  
The feeling when everything just seems pointless, my motivation to do anything, and my interest in everything goes to zero. This is when I think that I just want to end it.  
I had ""plans"" to kill myself, for example, If I ever get to that point when I just can't take it anymore then I would just go to a shooting range and shoot myself.  
Even though I had no reason to be depressed because at that point in my life everything has been going pretty well. I was happy, yet these feelings (or more like lack of them) came up every 2 months for a day or two, then it would go back to normal.  


Now I am at a point when I just don't feel good, and I don't even understand what is going on.  
I have been in my current relationship for a year now, and everything was just perfect.  
I have found my soulmate in her so to speak.  
But like 2 months ago, we didn't see each other for a month because of this COVID thing.  
We chatted, video chatted, played games together, and with our friends, talked on discord.   
Everything that we usually did when we were not separated and could meet each other during weekends.  
Then when we finally met, and suddenly everything was just off. I didn't enjoy her company, I felt like putting effort into the relationship was a burden and I felt like I just want to be alone, by myself no one around me, not even her.  
At first, I thought, that well love might be gone. But the more I thought about it the more I felt that I do love her very much still, something is off that I cant enjoy her presence, I don't feel like having sex with her.  
For a bit of time, I did think about it, what I just want another woman in my life, you know, an adventure, something new, but I couldn't really imagine putting any effort into creating a new relationship, because, I still think that my current one is THE one for me.  


Just to be clear, I don't have these ""bad"" feelings with her only, my motivation and interest generally are almost non-existent, when it comes to my family, friends or hobbies   
(I basically play gamed most of the time to not be extremely bored).  
I don't feel like I am myself anymore.  
When it came to the latter two, I just thought that I am an introvert and I am just like that, anti-social, etc.  
But there are times when I can feel that I finally feel something again, happiness and joy, but that only occurs when there are more of my friends present and we do something together.   
(but there are times when even that can't pique my interest)

  
The more I read about mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and more specifically anhedonia (which is a symptom of depression but many other illnesses as well, if I'm correct), the more I realized that maybe there is something that is not okay in my head.  


I've talked about this with some of my friends and with my girlfriend as well. She does understand the way I describe my feelings and she supports me in everything, so it's not like I couldn't tell her and had to keep it a secret, so at least that's a good thing.  


I will go to a psychologist or a psychiatrist, that is for sure.

Nothing bad or traumatic happened... it just struck me as soon as we got there. I was massively depressed there and I had a 2 week depressive episode when I got back which totally knocked me out. Couldn’t stop crying, kept falling asleep while sitting up, no appetite, shakiness constantly, just in a constant daze.. and panic attacks. no energy to get up or get dressed or shower. I had to miss work for that duration. It was horrendous. Eventually I started getting better and then I was back to normal... kinda. Ever since that day I haven’t felt the same.

I am barely able to speak because I feel like I would start to cry (although by this point I was just laughing an angry laugh) and my parents ask me what's wrong and if I'm crazy...
Well... That kind of overwhelmed me even more and I started to cry and went to my room, only able to stop maybe 10 min later. I stayed in my room though as I thought confrontation and having to explain would cause a repeated reaction.

191,"So for this example, I have ADHD and have tried medicines in the past, none of them worked which was very weird. I got g nome/ genetic testing to see what was up, and I apparently rapidly metabolize pretty much every ADHD medicine there is. My psychiatrist wanted to try adderall anyway to see if it would work by any chance considering there are 3 categories which are pretty much: (works, might work, doesn’t work.) adderall was under the might work category, so i tried it. Normal dose, nothing, max dose, nothing. (This is definitely not recommend so please don’t try this) but I did an experiment. I took the max dose which I believe was 40mg? And then every 45 minutes I would take 20mg more, eventually I got to 80mg and IT WORKED. (It worked just the same as my friends who are one their regular doses.) My psychiatrist is well aware of this “experiment” I did and how it worked. she was really weirded out at the fact it took 80mg to work, which most people are, so am I believe me. But it works, so we stick to it. and also believe me I tell her everything I do so that I don’t end up having any issues or what not. Does anybody else have this issue? Can be with any medicine, does anyone have that genetic/ g nome dna issue or whatever it is that causes certain medicines to rapidly metabolize? Please let me know! Thanks! 

Added note: Like I said, this is for all medicines, you can get the testing done and see what works best&amp; what most likely won’t work, so if not adderall do y’all experience taking more than normal of any other certain medication for it to actually work as it’s supposed to?

192,"I really can’t tell if something is wrong (personality disorder or somethin) or if I am just so anxious something is wrong that I micro-analyze things and think certain thoughts or actions are associated with mental illness. Like I’ve thought I’ve had 6ish personality disorders in the last year switching every so often; the problem is I can see symptoms I have in all of them. I talk to a therapist and he has not diagnosed me with anything except minor depression and anxiety, but I jus feel like I haven’t given him the whole picture sometimes. Idk, it just freaks me out thinking something is “wrong” with me. The most annoying part is I know it’s irrational and I’m probably just anxious, but I can’t help thinking it and proceeding to research symptoms—which makes it worse. Recently (since last night 😂) I’ve been thinking I have I have Schizotypal pd or OCD. I think the ocd would actually make sense, cause I do have a few compulsions and shi. Idk man i needed someone to rant to cause I can’t talk to no one bout dis shit. Thanks y’all.",25Jun2020,1

195,"Well, to start with I talked with a Gastroenterologist about my stomach problems, and now I have to go get an Upper GI done to find out if there is an ulcer in my stomach or whatever. I have to be put to sleep for it, about which I am apprehensive. I don't like being put under General Anesthesia...but I have no choice if I want to find out why I haven't been able to eat and why I have such bad reflux.   


Okay enough with the boring shit.  


Otherwise, I cut again last night because I just couldn't handle the urges to set everything on fire. It worked--the bleeding kept my mind off everything else. I don't want to cut anymore but I just can't deal with shit right now. This whole Probation thing (I came up hot for alcohol somehow even though I had not even a sip of my hubby's drink 2 weeks ago) is messing me up. I used hand sanitizer several times yesterday while I was waiting for my appointment...so I think THAT is what showed up. I am relieved a bit now because I know the test will come up negative when my PO sends it out. I am not in prison, which she could have Violated me, so I am thankful and feeling a little better. The relationship with my family is stronger than ever and I noticed that our older daughter (21) is genuinely supporting me and actually came to my appointment yesterday with me...as did our 12 year old daughter. We had a wonderful day out and about. I am so thankful to have all my family. I really am. For the first time in a while, I have NO thoughts of suicide. None. At all.   


  
This is long enough, and there isn't much more to say. The weather has been perfect and my life is just humming along. The ONLY thing that is bringing it down a bit is the fact that I am having a harder and harder time controlling my urges.

I've been doing terribly lately with everything that I do and I seem to fail whenever l try to change my personality and such. I can't function normally without talking to someone I know really well and that wants me to share with them my feelings. I try to express my feelings but my real life friends don't seem to understand me and continue to joke around with me like it never happened before but I expressed how I feel to them step by step. I couldn't feel like myself anymore and I felt disconnected with everyone and felt like nothing. I try avoid with everyone I see and myself included in the mirror. I had this feeling after I broke up with my girlfriend because she wanted to get with another guy and lied about her feelings with me. This ""guy"" was apparently my friend that she wanted to date. So she  blocked me from her social media accounts which made me feel frustrated and upsetting because I can't talk to her anymore. So I started to hate myself a lot and I felt hurt for awhile and never wanted to talk to anyone ever. I took out my anger at other people and saying shit that never existed in the first place like false information about an event that never happened basically.  This is where two other ""friends"" start to talk to me with negative impact and calling me with hurtful words so I had nothing to do about this but just to stare at their text. I took breaks from social media and Discord which didn't seem to help that much because I kept thinking about it and I wanted to go back to it but I had a headache from thinking about it so I just gave up.

Several times a day, I get stuck lying in bed or sitting at my desk while planning my day. E.g. it could be something as simple as getting up to get some water from the other room. I'd sit there for a few minutes thinking: should I bring my cup with me to the other room or bring the pitcher to this room? I should also throw away the garbage on my desk. Do I also need to turn up the heat along the way? Maybe I should stop by the bathroom too. Etc.

It would've been way quicker to just take action immediately, even if I have to make extra trips to the other room.

This is far worse for larger actions such as cooking, getting takeout, getting up in the morning, etc. Each morning, I'd plan my day in bed, then get tired from thinking, browse Reddit, and go back to planning my day. It usually takes me an hour to get up.

203,"my biological father left me and my mother before i was born. from what my mother has told me he got back with his ex, whatever, my mom (again from what she’s told me) was really proper about the situation. but that’s her side of the story.

fast forward to when i was six, my mom met my now stepdad who has literally been an angel for me - he’s my dad, period. (this has to do with what i’m getting at btw)

my mom, like a lot of other moms, has handed me a couple of ass whoppings so i always just considered it normal behavior. i am 16 now, and for the past 5 years, once a year i get beat up, im saying punches, bites, slaps, sometimes she even sits on top of me and i can’t breathe and she closes my mouth cause i scream and “the neighbor’s will hear us” - her words not mine. im not saying i don’t deserve the beating cause i’m being a shit sometimes and talk back at her, defend myself physically etc. 

lately, her and my (step) dad have been having problems, they don’t really tell me anything but idk if they’re staying together for me and my siblings or bc they genuinely want to. anyways, a few nights ago i realised my mom says some nasty things to my dad, she calls him a disappointment of a husband and a father, a joke and she claims he shit talks his own mother (who’s dead) and she’s sometimes racist towards some of his friends and just her beliefs in general although she denies it. when i heard them having this conversation - me not wanting to lose the only father figure i’ve ever had without exactly knowing what’s going on between them - jumped to the defense of my dad, called her some nasty things, got beaten up pretty badly and my dad had to break us apart, usual stuff !! 

i’m a person who had a pretty unsteady childhood as me and my mom lived with my aunts and uncles due to economical instability and i witnessed some physical fights between them and A LOT of shouting so it was pretty normalized behaviors till my dad came along, and i guess still is from time to time.

my feelings have been invalidated a lot by my mother and my dad just keeps making excuses for her and asking me to apologize to her after she beats me up. this has led me to a point where i don’t even trust my own feelings...??? if that makes sense ?? i feel sad or anxious or just down in general and there’s a voice saying i’m doing t for attention, and that i’m being dramatic and it’s just TORTURE. i hate living like this, not knowing if my own feelings are valid. i cant. i’ve been suicidal for the past year, i used to be 7 months clean of self harm but THAT went down the drain... 

i just don’t know what to do. i cant even think of the fact that my mother might be abusive cause every time i try to bring it up to someone or her, quite frankly, they laugh it off and either make fun of the fact that if believe such thing or say their experiences with their mothers were worse etc. i cant. i do not feel valid at all. i just- i cant even write this without crying for gods sake. i know that my mom is a good mom overall and she tried her best to raise me but is all that beating normal....? i just ??? i hate myself for even thinking about doubting her but there’s a part of me that tells me i should be.

anyways, i’m sorry for my rant. i just had to let that out somewhere. if you’re still reading this, thank you &lt;3",25Jun2020,1
204,"I'm a 20-year-old who recently got diagnosed with major depression and general anxiety disorder. I'm also currently being observed for bipolar disorder as my mother has bipolar disorder herself.

Prior to my diagnosis, my older brother and I have always thought that I had poor mental health. I don't remember this, but my brother disclosed with my psychiatrist that the first time I expressed wanting to end my life was when I was in 5th grade. I became very aware of my need for help during my freshman year in high school. I told my parents about wanting to end my life, and their response was what made me not get it until my current university assigned me with a counselor that then got me a psychiatrist. They basically dismissed it as either drama (my mom) or that I'm too privileged to feel this way (my dad). I'll spare you the gritty details, but my mom disowned us, siblings, in November 2018. In 2019, it was my high school graduation. She came uninvited, made a scene, and yelled at us, saying she'll sue us. My dad still financially supports us, but he used to tell me to talk to my mom again. Her toxicity led to me hating answering phone calls, hearing my phone ring, getting video call requests. I'm so irrationally scared of them because I'm so scared of being yelled at, of being cursed, of being told I'll die because of what I'm doing with my life. I'm scared of facing her, scared to hear her say that she doesn't love me (she said it during my graduation). I don't think I want to talk to her right now, not until she admits she did something wrong or apologizes. She doesn't have to apologize to me, I want her to apologize to my brother, who loves her so much and was with her through thick and thin before I came along.

Recently, I realized something that made me cry to my friends: I don't remember my mom's face or voice. It's like my brain is deliberately deleting the things about her. I have photos of her, but I don't recognize her. I'd think of her voice, but I wouldn't remember what it sounded like. My brother asked me if I wanted to remember her voice. He'd show me videos of her if I wanted to. I told him ""not now"". I wasn't sure why I'm reluctant. I'm so heartbroken for forgetting, but at the same time, I'm so scared. I tried remembering her singing voice, but I'd just breakdown sobbing because it hurt. I couldn't associate that calming voice with the photos I have of her. I can't think of her face without thinking ""that's not right"" or ""there's something off"".

I'm sorry. I don't want to make my brother worry anymore, so I looked for a place to post this. He's done so much for me, so much that he lost his parents because of me. Sorry. I don't know where I'm going with this. Sorry if this didn't make sense. Sorry.",25Jun2020,1

Me and my sister have the same circle of friends since we are very close and we are suspecting that one of our friends is having some trouble with his relationship.

He used to be an outgoing person, very confident and super friendly. Just straight up one of the most wonderful human beings I have ever met, but he has been acting so weird lately...

Like I said, he used to be very confident and he really looks great but his confidence that I always admired has just... vanished. I’ve heard his boyfriend downplaying his achievements more than once and making nasty comments about his looks and spoke about that with my sister, she told me that she noticed that too. Literally the most obvious red flag.

With all this pandemic stuff going on he’s stuck at his apartment and probably getting visits from his boyfriend since they live in the same building. I was video chatting with him yesterday and noticed that he had tiny bruises on his face and arms, I’m worried it already got to that point. I even activated those shortcuts on my phone so I could screenshot it without him noticing so I could show it to my sister, she again agreed it looked like bruises.

Should I tell his mom? She’s really chill about everything and a good mother but I don’t know if it would work (he’s only 20 btw, an adult but still not fully independent). Should I contact any authorities? Try to talk him out of this?",25Jun2020,1

Then, I also have no motivation and I feel hopeless, but that's probably because I'm at an age where feeling lost is normal. And of course I find it difficult to make decisions because I'm a naturally anxious person. I'm just scared of making mistakes. 

And I can't even say if there is a ""loss"" of motivation or interest, because I've never truly been invested in anything. So I can't really tell. It's always been this way. But I also know that I'm currently unhappy, and this might all just be a phase I have to struggle through, but when comes the point where everything gets better?

I've had depression for quite some time already. But since a few months before May, it suddenly started getting worse and worse and worse. So, you could probably how bad it is at this point. 

To give you an idea if you can't guess; there was a time in my life that every ounce of me was severely negative. I never saw anything positive and I constantly wanted to die. It took me a year to finally snap out of that and change who I was. 

But recently, because everything's been going wrong in my mind and around me, I'm slightly feeling a comeback from how I used to be. And I absolutely hate it, I don't want that. But now it's just so bad. I can't even physically do anything. I can't move. It's like I'm not in control of my body anymore even though my mind is thinking it. ""Just get up"" I'm thinking, but I can't move.

Another thing that doesn't help is that, from what I believe, I've lost one of my close friends. No they didn't die, I just mean I believe that they decided it would be better to stay away from me and ditch and run. I don't blame them. (I have a very traumatic past and present which usually makes people want to leave, because it becomes too heavy for them to handle or know about. But this friend is a longer story than what I'm saying here, so please don't make any assumptions and think I'm going to agree if you say something bad about them.) And so, I feel awful for it. I feel like this just made my depression even worse.

Hello all. I'm currently a university student looking to speak to someone about some mental struggles. I'm not really sure what's wrong with me.

I went to my school's health and wellness department and I told them I was interested in long-term sessions so they referred me to a few clinics.

The first clinic said that they have graduate and associate students working as counselors under supervision from licensed counselors. They don't have much information about the psychology aspect on their website.

The second clinic says that they have psychological assistants working under supervision from a main licensed psychologist but the assistants have a Psy. D in clinical psychology.

The third clinic says it is also staffed by doctoral students in clinical psychology under the supervision of licensed psychologists.

213,"Hi all, thanks for your time. I was raised by narcissistic parents, and thus have only ever dated narcissists, aside from my current, very healthy and stable relationship. Throughout my childhood, I was always taught to take responsibility and be accountable. Throughout my relationships, everything, no matter how big or small, was ""my fault"". I know that obviously this isn't true, and in the case of my upbringing, I did not need to take responsibility for things that were not my fault. But now that I'm 22, this thought pattern I have of everything being my fault and responsibility has taken over. I blame myself for absolutely everything. I will analyze a situation down to it's core until I find how I played a role in the downfall, then blame myself for the failure. For example, today my boyfriend tried to call me and surprise me by bringing lunch to my job. I was in a meeting and I missed his call, he was wondering what I would want. I called him back immediately when the meeting was over, and he couldn't bring me lunch anymore as there was not enough time. I know this seems small and insignificant, but the thought that if I would have just answered or had been able to get out of the meeting sooner then he would have been able to carry out this act of kindness that he was planning, and it would have made him happy to do so. So now, I've been in this cyclical thought pattern for most of the day thinking about how I messed up his plan, and it's my fault for not answering sooner. 

I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to cope with this and ultimately get rid of this crippling self-blame. I have been in therapy before, and I am planning on going back very soon. If anyone has any tips, affirmations, or general resources, I'd love for you to share!

215,"Bit of a life story here. I’m a guy and I’ve been feeling this way on/off since about the age of 14/15. I’m now 20. I feel down, resigned, lonely, and honestly wish i were dead, but without the trauma it would cause my family. I’ve got one or two decent friends but they have their own groups who I’m not apart of and are always doing things with them. &amp; the thought of being a tag along just makes me sick. I always felt like the one who people forgot to invite. Whilst the good friends i had in High School I’ve drifted away from and miss them but they’re in their own group too &amp; don’t share as many interests with me anymore. I’m quite quiet and shy around new people and feel like I’m always come across as being rude, but once i get to know them i open up. I’ve got a good &amp; sick sense of humour, broad interests, i can put on a normal front and am not too socially awkward, although feel like as my anxiety has increased tenfold the last 2/3 years, so has my awkwardness, whilst i also hate attention. I don’t really post on social media much cos i just feel like its a massive facade and i hate putting myself out there, but i use it to keep in touch with some long distance friends and watch everyone else’s fun. I think all this really started when my original group of friends in HS basically kicked me out of their group, i think its because I’d started hanging around with some other boys who were in more of my classes in school. It hit me really hard because it came out of nowhere and I’ve struggled to form close bonds ever since, &amp; i also haven’t spoken to any of them about it. It makes it harder too because a few of them live on my street so i see them together now and again. Now my close couple of mates are also in that group. 

I’ve got big family issues that I’ve never really shared with anyone. My parents divorced when i was 4, after my dad’s business collapsed &amp; he ended up in prison for a couple of years for insurance fraud. My mum’s a borderline alcoholic, and we’ve struggled with money from since i can remember. We’ve not been on holiday for about 10 years, never went anywhere when were younger and get the bare minimum at xmas. She was also in an abusive relationship with my little brother’s dad for about 7/8 years. He beat her up, intimidated her, mentally tormented us, hit me &amp; made us live our lives looking over our shoulders for a good 10 years. My dad’s not in a much better position, hes 70 so I’ve only ever known him as being quite old &amp; he is a heavy smoker. I fear for his health &amp; have resigned myself to the fact he probably won’t be around to see any children i might have. Alzheimers runs in his side of the family too, and he’s showing some signs which scares me. 

Academically, I’ve overachieved considering my home life. I’ve done it on my own without extra tuition or any push from my parents, and have 11 GCSEs A*-B, 3 A Levels (AAB), and am now in a Russell Group Uni. I took a year out after sixth form because i dropped out of my original university choice after 3 weeks. My anxiety and all my issues throughout my school years all came to a head and moving away/ imposter syndrome tipped me over the edge. I was bawling my eyes out every night on facetime to my mum, considering i hadn’t cried properly since about the age of 13. I’ve never felt closer to suicide than those few weeks of my life. Until now, where its bubbling back up again. Being back home due to covid cutting my first year at my new university short has sent me spiralling. I’ve realised just how lonely i am &amp; how much i want a group of friends who do things, suggest days/nights out, support each-other. Something to feel a part of. Whilst my living situation is sh*t. I don’t have a bedroom anymore since moving to uni as my younger brother now has it. I sleep on the sofa and have no privacy. No space to be allowed to feel like sh*t. My older brother (27) &amp; my older sister (30) still live at home &amp; she is especially hard to live with. She’s bipolar and very loud, theatrical and is working from home. She’s so in your face, she can never tone it down. She’s turned our living room (now my bedroom) into her makeshift office so i have to be up early and have nowhere to spend my days. I would live with my dad but his place is a sh*thole, smelling of cigarettes. My mum tries and feels bad but what can she do. My home life has ruined any potential relationships i might have had because i didn’t want to introduce them to my dysfunctional &amp; embarrassing world, especially when the girls i was close to were from wealthy families and out of my league looks wise, I’d have felt like an imposter. 

I’m praying university gets back to normal in September so i can have a life again, even then I’ve struggled to make loads of friends, I’ve got a couple but not the vast group i imagined. Being home and looking at snapchat, seeing everyone out socialising, old school mates meeting up with each other and people doing things just makes me feel worse. This is just the tip of the iceberg too, these are the only feelings that i can actually put into words. I don’t want medication either, because my mum’s been on anti-depressants my whole life and she never seems happy. I’d like a pill which could guarantee that i could restart my life, in normal surroundings, normal family, fewer worries, less of the crippling responsibilities that have been put upon me from a young age.

I know that a tell tale sign of depression is losing interest in everything, and constantly being sad.  I’m confusing, I have lost interest in many old hobbies (albeit I’ve never had many) and I have been self medicating with weed - I’ve since stopped. I also have been using cocaine, also quit 2 weeks ago so I’m clear minded at least now.

But it’s not like I’m in bed all day, I wash/clean/cook, I enjoy walking and I’m interested in news and things online and reading. So then I think maybe I’m not depressed.

But, I have terrible self esteem, like no confidence, I have real bad anxiety (I’m also certain I have GAD , but I’m careful not to self diagnose) and I’m lonely, and regret my past and worry about the future. I’m definitely not happy, quite the opposite in general (but I can distract myself momentarily sometimes) but I also have negative thoughts running in my mind, hence why I smoked to escape the dark cloud.

Yesterday though, I found an odd solace. I look at all the hurt and pain in the world rn and I used to think the way to solve it was to fight back and start a revolution. But now I’ve thought of something that gives me peace, what if I killed myself and uploaded a small opinion piece on how to fix our world to the internet. Therefore my death will garner enough attention to bring about change. I no longer will have to live in fear of diseases killing me when I can dictate when I die and make something of it. Maybe I need help but this just sounds right to me. It brings me contentment",25Jun2020,1
221,"So, from what I know, self-harm or self-harm urges can come from many different causes. It could be out of guilt, to destres yourself, as a punishment, to feel something. (These are all things I remember from my 10th grade health class so forgive me if it’s wrong)
But, over the past half-year ish, I’ve been getting self-cutting thoughts and urged. And it’s not for the reasons above. It’s odd, but the urge is often just to see what it would feel like. I stare at my forearm and I imagine how it would be if I cut down it, and usually I imagine it as some kind of like.. release and it makes me want to try it. These things have been coming up in my mind more and more recently, so I’m just wondering and trying to understand. Anyone who has seen or dealt with self-harm for a reason like this, does anyone know why this happens? Is it a side-effect of some bigger mental health issu? Is it just intrusive thoughts? I just want to understand it.",25Jun2020,1
223,"TW: self harm and suicide 

I haven’t been professionally diagnosed by a doctor but I know that there’s probably something wrong with me. I’m constantly thinking about my suicide and I’ve already nearly attempted it but I was too coward to do it. I have also been self harming for nearly three years now but I have no desire to stop. I’m always thinking about how I deserve to die and how no one would care if I was gone. I also feel like I’m always worrying about something and I feel scared all the time. 

There’s a part of me that knows I need help but I feel like therapy would be a waste of time and my parents money. I don’t deserve to get help anyways. I have such a hard time opening up about how I feel. I get really nervous around people and it’s really hard for me to talk to them. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to open up to a therapist. All of the therapists around me are only offering Tele therapy and I wouldn’t be able to do that because I have a huge fear of cameras.

224,"I am a university student who had a busy life with studies, relation and income via tuition (the amount is a big deal in my country). Now, due to lockdown, I have no income, no way to be busy or meet my g/f. I am stuck at home for 102 days. I'm tired of being locked down, not being busy again.

I used to play online competitive games with few people. It's been a month that they ditched me cause they feel I am too serious to win. It's not true. I just don't have fun through losing, thus I practice before going in a match and I get bullied for this reason. I haven't played any game without them thus I feel kinda lonely when I see them queueing in different games. Then I just play solo or play offline games. 

6days ago, was my birthday and very few had wished. A lot of people whom I expected to wish didn't hesitate to message me. 

Anxious, panicked mind ruins my day. Makes me feel more miserable. Thus I can't enjoy any games, tv series to spend time. Also, I can't sleep more than 2-3 hours. I go to sleep at 4am and wake up at 6/7am everyday. 

Only thing that is still keeping me together is my g/f, family and thought of that someday, this lockdown will open and I'll be back to my busy life, ignoring these ditches, feelings of unimportance. That I would be a changed person after this lockdown due to knowing the real faces of people I used to thought close of.",25Jun2020,1

226,"I’m finding it so hard to cope, it all started with extreme hypochondria, having panic attacks on the back of the bus, crying myself to sleep every night because I thought I was dying of cancer or sepsis despite having gone to the doctors multiple times and now it has evolved into constant guilt and me hating myself over past very small mistakes, mistakes other people wouldn’t even remember. Anytime I think about something small that I’ve done I get this sinking feeling in my chest and I feel like crying. Sometimes it’s so bad I have panic attacks. After a while of loathing and hating myself i’ll finally come to terms with the guilt and be at peace then.... BOOM another topic comes to mind. I can’t escape. It’s gotten so bad that i’ve contemplated su*c*de, i’d never actually do it though, I just have it as a thought in the back of my head in case the guilt becomes too much to handle. What’s funny is that the stuff i’m weeping over are things I’ve said YEARS ago and i hadn’t thought of them until a couple weeks ago.

 (I’m not even sure if this part is linked to OCD but i’ll still share) And this past week i’ve been EXTREMELY paranoid, I keep thinking a certain someone is out to get me, a new van has been parked on the opposite side of my house for the past 3 days and I then went crazy thinking that the person was coming to get me to the point where i wouldn’t sleep until the morning (so my family would be awake.) I’ve thought about keeping a weapon under my bed but then I realised that I sound extremely delusional. I think i’m going insane. I don’t know what to do for help.

Im just now getting to the point where my past doesnt cause immense pain every sine second of my life and that i dont absolutely hate myself. My problem is that i just cant keep relationships for very long weither they be friends or more. Maybe its because i dont knkw how to have relationships due to the fact ive never really been treated good. I dont know. All i know is i feel terribly alone but people just dont talk to me much. My social media posts get ignored same with my texts or messages. Cause of covid19 im stuck at home and was hoping to finally go to college this fall at the age of 23 now im not gonna be able to do that yhe nromal way thus making it harder to form relationships.

Jenna marbles leaving YouTube was the cherry on top of an already shitty year. I've been watching her for years, since I was child. She has a huge impact on me and my friends, and her leaving is like loosing a friend. Her videos always made me feel better, and I can't rewatch them knowing that's she's gone.

Advice?",25Jun2020,1
242,"I don’t even know where to start. My life is a big mess and I don’t know how to fix it. Also sorry in advance if this post is just a big angry rant. 

I’m 16 and in secondary school ( high school ) and I’m going into my last year in September. I haven’t studied in months and I’m so behind. I just don’t have the motivation to study anymore. I barley have the motivation to shower. I just feel like giving up on everything and lying in bed all day. 

I don’t have any friends because I’m autistic. Nobody likes me, I just feel like a massive burden to everyone. My family don’t even like me. My brother thinks that I should kill myself. And relationships ? I’ll die alone. I’ll never be good enough for anyone. I feel even more lonely during this lockdown, I don’t have a friend asking if I’m doing okay. I could die right now and barely anyone would notice or care. I just want one person to care about me. I’m nice to other people but I’m still not good enough ever. Even if someone actually has something to do with me, I’m always the least important to them. They’ll use me, then forget about me. The most f*cked up part is that I’m okay with it. It’s better than being alone. 

I feel worthless. I just don’t feel “right” constantly. I don’t even understand why but I never feel “right”. I try to make myself feel “right” but there’s always something else wrong. I think it’s because I want to be perfect but that’s not realistic. I’m a negative person and I always think the worst. I don’t believe in myself and I never try my hardest anymore. 

I hate my appearance but I’m not ugly. I know that I could look good if I actually put some effort into my appearance but I don’t feel like bettering myself. I just think to myself “what’s the point ? Sure I could look good but I’ll still be invisible to every single person around me”. I wear the same ugly clothes and hairstyle everyday. I’m too afraid to change, although part of me wants to. I care about other people’s opinions too much and I don’t feel like I deserve to look good or feel a bit better about myself. 

I hate myself, I hate my life and I want to die. I fantasise about suicide but my OCD makes me afraid of death, so I can’t do anything about it. 

My OCD has ruined my life. I have strong, disturbing thoughts everyday. I feel overwhelmed by my OCD and I just want to stop obsessing constantly but I can’t. My compulsions are becoming very hard to handle lately. I’ve injured my jaw, wrist and ear during quarantine. I’m in pain but I just can’t stop. I have to grind my teeth and move my jaw constantly. 

I don’t hate being autistic, being autistic has a lot of perks. I hate how I’m treated because of my autism. I live in a small town, my parents have told people that I’m autistic and of course everybody knows. People treat me like a child, no matter how well I present myself. People speak to me like I’m 16 months old, not 16 years old. I’m never taken seriously by anyone. I’m just the stupid, weird, disabled kid. Sometimes I feel like I’m not even human, because that’s how I’m treated. I can’t live my life being treated this way for something that I can’t control. For example, there was a rewards ceremony in my school. I was given a new award, made just for me. The “SPECIAL achievement award”. I was the top student in most of my classes but that’s what I got. Every other student got a subject award. I can never do enough, I’ll never be good enough and no one ever has faith in me. People are basically just telling me that I’m autistic and that I should know my place. I’m an outcast and it really hurts. 

I usually go through a few months of being this way and then I start to feel a bit better but these feelings are lasting longer than they usually do and I’m not sure if there going to ever go away. Things build up, I have a breakdown and then I push myself to be “normal” again and it works for a small bit. I can’t continue doing this, I want to be a functional person. I’m even unpredictable to myself.

I have a migraine for the past few days. Other physical stress symptoms affect me almost everyday also. It could be palpitations one day and chest pain the next. I can’t even tell when I’m sick or stressed anymore. 

I’m desperate for a way out of this. I can’t take it anymore. I would be friends with anyone, even if they treated me horribly. I would do anything for someone who even cares about me slightly, it’s pathetic. I’m pathetic. 

I’m broken, I cry all of the time, I’m unpredictable, I’m weird, I’m a mess and I don’t know how to fix it all. If there’s no way of fixing my life then I don’t really feel that motivated to live.

I could write for hours about my life and how unhappy I am but obviously nobody wants to listen. When I try to reach out for help, I’m told that it’ll get better or to just get over it. It doesn’t get better, it gets worse. Every year I lose a bit more of my sanity. I remember when I was 13 and happy. I wish it could be like that again. 

I have nothing to live for. Also I don’t even know what the point of this post is, I just need to get it off my chest.",25Jun2020,1

Also another thing i neglected to add to the bit about my girlfriend is that if she or any of my friends are walking home my head instantly goes through every possible thing that could happen the other day we where walking round town and she want to go home so i offered her a lift she politely declined but i was insistent she still ended up declining and stopped pressuring her as i didn't want to annoy her and so i didn't bring up that point 

Also sometimes i'm not doing anything that requires my undivided attention and random thoughts just pop into my head like ''If i jumped out that window, who would care? would anyone care?''

The last time I did this, I received almost nothing back in response.  I've looked into Better Help a few times, but I am considering going for it this time around.  I just want to get started with therapy.  While I know finding a good therapist is not something you should rush, it is also something that I'm tired of putting off because I can't find someone.  

Better Help offered me $45 per week (so $180 a month) for their services.  I am hesitant to commit to this because I don't know much about it and I don't know who my therapist would be before I make a payment.

I don’t really talk to anyone about how much pain I’m in all the time - including my therapists (yes, plural). I’m starting to want to give up again. It’s been a rough battle and it seems never ending. I actually feel like I have no one in my corner and I’m fighting for myself for no reason. I’m so ashamed of my own depression and how it debilitates my ability to function on a daily basis. Some days, I think about admitting myself into the hospital again to have someone take care of me and to stop all the noise and bullshit that surrounds my life. I’m tired of pleasing people, feeling frustrated, pretending to be cheerful and just never giving myself the time to deal with it all. How many more CBT and EMDR sessions is it going to take before I can begin to truly feel like a functional person again? Will I ever get over being haunted with my sexual assault? The amount of people doubting me? The amount of times I am discredited and under appreciated? How many more meds or dosage increases do I need to go through before I become more stable?

In 2020 I have gone down hill so much that I cant even comprehend how I could fall apart this fast.

January:I started having random episodes of crying and losing reality. I also started getting severe headaches everyday.

February:I was stressed, and I had gotten into a relationship just to be dumped the same day my mother attempted. I went mute again for the first time in years. 

March:I started having full on manic episodes and used to cry to my mom because my head felt like it was gonna explode.

April:I was decently stable till my birthday came around and I had to block one of my friends because they were making me uncomfortable. The rest of the month turned to shit

May:I started having anxiety when reading and suddenly lost all interest in just being alive, I wanted to leave so bad. My mental health hit what I thought was it's lowest, I fucken lost my mind and I had a day where I spent 3 hours sitting on the bathroom floor screaming and crying because I was having an awful PSTD meltdown. It sucked ass and ever since then I've been shaking everyday.

Now:I cannot read, type, or even exist while having some sense of anxiety, I have yet to cry one though. I've lost interest in most things and I no longer feel pleasure in things I used to.
