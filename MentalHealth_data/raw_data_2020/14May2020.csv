0,"I’ve searched everywhere to try and find what this is, I’ve seen a couple posts with similar things from years ago. 

I can describe it best as every single sound and thought becomes very loud like it’s screaming at me and will last maybe 5/10 minutes depending how quick I can get it away. I discovered listening to music and focusing on lyrics or doing something else helps it go away. I find it difficult to speak when this happens as I can’t hear what volume my voice is actually at.

I’ve had this as long as I remember I’m now 16, it happened often when I was younger left for a couple years than came back like 4 years ago. Maybe 2 years ago I started getting it very often maybe every two weeks as I was very anxious (I won’t say I had anxiety as wasn’t diagnosed). Haven’t had it in a while now. 

I’ve just discovered when I was younger I had Alice in wonderland syndrome/Todd’s syndrome. Used to hallucinate mice rolling balls, constantly changing size and other things and it would feel like my bed was rocking lots.",14May2020,1
1,"So around a few days ago I posted a rant on this subreddit because I was having, what the cool kids call, a 'bad time.'

Unfortunately, I'm still having said bad time and I don't know how to fix it.

Around Sunday I went completely numb. Only negative thoughts and empty-headed. Typical depressive episode for me, I reasoned it would be gone in a couple days-- but ohohoh, boy, did it get much, much worse. Monday afternoon comes and my thoughts are so negative that I have tears constantly streaming down my face and it's been that way ever since. I'm constantly fighting the urge to slit my wrists open, or toss my car into the highway pit as I drive and hope it explodes. I've had no desire to eat, no desire to talk to friends, no desire to even turn on my computer. I literally only made this reddit account because I thought I was losing my damn mind and wanted to type my thoughts out since I don't like to bother my friends with this sorta stuff. Still unsure if something triggered my episode, since my depression has been interfering with my memories pretty bad as of late.

While the suicidal thoughts aren't new, it's never been this bad nor lasted this long. I do normally have a little anxiety but it's never been this extreme. The only reason I'm able to type anything out right now is because I'm majorly hopped up on Oxycodone. ( No, I do not abuse drugs nor drink alcohol. This was the only thing that ended up calming me down enough from wanting to kill myself. )

What is going on? Is this a panic attack, or just a really shitty, horrible depressive episode? I really don't want to be emitted anywhere as I just started a job that I hope I'll enjoy in the future, but I just want an understanding of what's going on.",14May2020,1
2,"This might be a bit strange, but I miss the feeling of sadness. I've actually been gradually getting better over the last year, and I've made so much progress by myself that I don't really feel sad anymore.  I still have problems, as we all do, but I've come to accept them, and instead of feeling sad, now I just feel empty, and I absolutely hate it. I've been literally trying to make myself feel sadness by listening to songs, or watching sad videos, but nothing comes, just emptiness where sadness should be. Even just thinking about this I still don't feel sad, I just don't feel like anything, like something is missing. I just want to have a good cathartic cry, and let go of everything, but I can't.",14May2020,1
3,"Not sure ""realize"" is the right verb, because it sounds like I came to my senses. I mean I've reflected on it. Might actually come to my senses later on.

I want a girlfriend because that would make me feel socially successful and I feel I'd get validation from her. But I know that's not how things work. I'd just feel frustrated instead because things wouldn't go the way I hope.

I need to work on myself and I have to make myself happy. I'm not fit for a relationship and I can get what I need from my friends.",14May2020,1
4,"So tonight it's currently 1:09 am Ive had 2 panic attacks considered suicide and learned I hate myself even more this could be a long story its gonna be filled with spelling mistakes and shit idgaf rn so yeah deal with that shit

So a couple of days ago I started talking to my ex again only person I've ever fallen in love with broke my heart blah blah blah anyway tonight I'm about to sit down watch a movie do some school work and I have a panic attack completely out of knowhere I know I was going to have a bad day I just knew it and then that shit fucking happens and yeah.

Nobody is replying to me im scared I'm desperatly in need of help then finally 1 person replies who knows how to deal with them who helps me then I get called by someone else we talk for a couple hours and yeah it's not bad she helped but then she hung up and I had another 1 and freaked out again.

Then I sent this msg to my ex ""Okay so I still have feelings for u and no matter what they won't go away but talking to u is hard and weird and sometimes it hurts ik that I can't be friends with u idk if I trust u to be in a relationship with and I can't cut u out of my life because that's too hard too so idk what to do honestly... "" and yeah I then apologised to everyone for being such a burden on them and constantly complaining and being selfish.

Then I came here to say all this I just want to die I need help so so badly but all the doctors surgery's are shut so I can't see a gp and I just really need help.",14May2020,1
5,"I'm a 15 year old male. I have a problem with sexual fantasies. 
I'm not sure if it counts as a mental problem but I just don't know where to reach out for help so I went here.
When I masturbate I fantasize. That's normal and all but not the fantasies themselves. I like to fantasize about either girls my age, young girls under my age or women very much above my age.
It scares me. It scares me so much when I think about the thought of being into children. My parents are proud of me and always tell me how they can't wait until I start a family of my own. But I can't do that when I'm into elder women or children. It might just be puberty but it doesn't feel like it.

Of course I would never have sex with children. The thought of doing that frankly disgusts me. But at the same time it turns me on. Same with elder women.

I just don't know what to do with thoughts I'm having. It came out of the blue a couple of weeks ago.",14May2020,1
6,"I have Depression, Anxiety disorder, Asperger’s, and Autism. The only way I can seem to be happy is by doing the things I like to do, which consists of listening to music, playing video games, watching movies/TV shows, and spending time on the internet, whether it’d be through Facebook, Discord, Instagram, or YouTube. Those shouldn’t be the only things that make me happy, right? Because everything else I do with my life seems to bore me to death, and it makes me wonder why I’m even alive in the first place.",14May2020,1
7,"I often have this overwhelming feeling of... well I’m not quite sure how to describe it. I feel completely out of touch with everything. I can’t help but look up at the sky and wonder what even are we? The universe is so big that not even our tiny minds can possibly comprehend what’s out there.. and yet here we are? Wrapped up in melodramatic arguments and focusing on shit that, in the grand scheme of things, is totally irrelevant. 

Like I have such a hard time comprehending what LIFE actually is. Earth is a tiny speck in the universe. We’re literally living inside of a “rock” that is floating amongst other rocks. it’s such an overwhelming and weird feeling?? It’s kind of overruling my way of living... like what the actual fuck is life????? It scares me. I have borderline personality disorder and I’m not sure if this is a symptom or not?",14May2020,1
8,"Right, so I am quite drunk typing this, and being born in Sweden, English is my second language. please forgive me for mispelling stuff/bad grammar.  I am 23, I have never been truly happy or satisfied with my life. I have always felt as if I am an outsider, I have rarely felt as if I can relate to others.
 I have never truly been in love, I've had crushes, I have been in one relationship so far which lasted 6 months.

 That was 2 years ago. I have a job that I have worked at for 5 years. It's a job in a grocery store and I hate it.
It causes me physical and mental pain and fatigue. I failed school because of depression so I have a couple of subjects I need to complete to get a degree(?)
My mother was, and is very over protective and I feell like that has stunted my development as an adult human being. I still live at home anf I hate it. It feels like they expect that I would've moved out by now.
I have done some IQ-tests which tell me I gave around 130-135 IQ and it feels like I am wasting that brain capacity by accomplishing nothing. I have been tricked and teased by girls I've fancied at a younger age because they thought it was funny. I am now fairly attractive though a little overweight.

That is basically my background, I have probably missed some details etc but it basically describes my childhood to adulthood. My issue atm is whether or not life is worth it, because it doesn't seem like it tbh. I don't know what to do with my life and the fact that I'm kinda into a girl atm that has expressed that she is not interested in a relationship atm because of leaving a 5 year relationship 1 year ago makes me sad.And  I am not even sure I am in love with her. This kind of shit makes me contemplate suicide but I could never go trough with it because of what it would do to my mother and grandparents. I still wonder if life is even worth it because of how unstimulating and depressing it is. Apologies for the long text but I figured you might as well get the whole story. Even though I might'vw missed some things.
Tldr; I hate my life, is it even worth it",14May2020,1
9,"Hello! I am 17 year girl, my diagnosed mental illnesses are Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) PTSD. I've been suffering from both for 4 years (since I was 13). Recently I've talked to a Psychiatrist so I could get a proper medication to treat my Depression and since then I've been thinking a lot about my mental illness. I've been doing some research and I feel like I may have Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The thing is, I don't know how to bring this up to my therapist. From the get-go I've always been ashamed to talk about my feelings and thoughts and such. I trust my therapist a lot but I still feel shame when telling them personally things, I guess I don't want to disappoint them. 

To help understand my relationship with my therapist, I consider myself very close to them. They're the first therapist I've been able to open up to and I've been seeing them since the summer of 2019. They're really kind, understanding, and comforting; they do help me a lot. They make me feel loved and give me very nice compliments, they consider me one of their favorite patients as well. They have such a good image of me and believe that I'm a good person. This may seem like an ideal therapist &amp; patient relationship, but there's a tiny problem. I'm an extreme people pleaser person and the fact that they have such a high image of me makes me feel very guilty when I share any negative feelings that I may have. I keep trying to tell myself that I'm getting better but I feel like I'm truly not, I lie to them and tell them that I'm doing fine, not because I don't trust them, but because I don't want to disappoint them. I feel like if I open more to them, they'll be disappointed to see that I haven't gotten better, I also don't want them to be disappointed in themselves because they're truly a good person and I don't want them to feel like they're not helping me. 

I want to say that I'm not the kind of person that self-diagnosis without doing research, I have done my research on BPD and I truly feel like I might have it. I'm not self-diagnosing, though, that's why I'm here to ask for advice. There's certain symptoms of BPD that I feel that heavily relates to me, especially the one about fear of abandonment. I've always had an intense fear of being abandoned, sometimes I wonder if it has to do with childhood trauma (which is a whole other topic, I'm still skeptical on this because I have repressed childhood memories, I don't know much about what happened in my childhood, let me know if I should touch on this topic more). My fear of abandonment sometimes leads me to have anxiety attacks and periods of paranoia. If I feel like a friend is becoming distant, I overthink like crazy and cause myself to have anxiety attacks. When a person I consider close leaves me, I dissociate and go through a heavy period of depression, sometimes I go through self-destructive behavior and commit self-harm and resort to drugs. I'm also a quite impulsive person which can lead to self-sabotage sometimes. I can get violent at times when I lose control of my emotions, sometimes I feel like I have a huge amount of bottled up anger. When I can no longer bottle it up, I explode, I harm myself and have suicidal thoughts. I'm prone to stress and I can stress over minor things for a long period of time. I never allow myself to be at peace and just go from a negative thought to another negative thought. I'm also quite obsessed with love and intimate relationships, I want to have someone close to me and when I can't have that, I feel like I have no identity. During my last breakup I felt extremely numb and dissociated for 2 months. I resorted to drugs (which I was incredibly against) because I just wanted to feel something. I go against my own morals and values when I lose control of my emotions. I haven't told my therapist about this.

I want to be able to scream out ""*This is how I feel!*"" but I can't, there's an overwhelming feeling of guilt and shame deep in me that prevents me from doing that. There's days when I get lost in my own thoughts and wonder ""*Am I faking my mental illnesses? Am I doing this for attention?*"" The mere thought of faking a mental illnesses makes me feel sick, but I can't help but wonder if that's what I'm doing. I've always hated sharing how I feel because it makes me feel like an attention seeker, so that's why I keep quiet. I truly don't know what to do about this. Please help me.",14May2020,1
10,"Recently I learned about BPD. I did some research and I show a lot of the signs.

I asked around though about it, and it seems that one problem people encountered is that doctors are often reluctant to diagnose it and people go undiagnosed a while even if they receive professional help. 

I've been in therapy for self-harm/suicidal thoughts for 7 months now and my therapist hasn't brought the possibility up even though it seems I show tell tale signs. 

So I wanted to understand why it seems like something therapists avoid diagnosing so I'm kind of ""In the know"" and maybe become aware of the connotations that this disorder brings when I bring it up to my therapist.

Some info would be really appreciated! THanks",14May2020,1

- i would forget a word and remember it 5 mins later or i would know the word in a certain language but i wouldn't remember its translation in another language (my native language most of the time )
- whenever i read a text , even though i got the main idea of it , i read it plenty of times again and again just to make sure that i understand it because i always feel like i don't understand what i'm reading , to top it all , i obsess over it and go to my phone notes and try to write the main idea just to make sure that i understood it .
- when there's a discussion , i feel like i have the arguments at the back of my head but they're foggy and i can't express them properly or defend my point of view , so , once again , i obsess over it and i go to my phone notes and try to write an essay with my pov and the arguments that go with it .

12,"Hi, I have been struggling with depression almost my hole life and i hate it. One day i found out about this sub and started to read many posts.

That's why I'm offering emotional support for anyone that don't have someone to talk about it. I'll gladly listen and try to help. I'm not a mental health professional but I'll try my best. Message me if you feel sad, lonely, anxious or anything, please do it no matter who you are. I'll answer as soon as i can. Some people that I've spoken said that there problem wasn't enough for the effort to help. If you have this kind of thoughts please know that this isn't right. Every person is worthy of help and every problem is worthy of a solution.

1. I'm really not sure if this is the right subreddit, so if it isn't, I'm sorry, please just remove this post
2. I'm not formally diagnosed with any mental illnesses, but the last time I went to see my GP (pre-Corona) she tried to suggest to my mum that I may have an anxiety disorder ( apparently all I was doing was bouncing my leg and looking nervous though so she (my mother) didn't take it too seriously)

&amp;#x200B;

I **(15/F)** have found that for the past year or so, but especially the past few months, that when I start to like something, it's pretty much all I focus on for about a week or so (I think the longest I've ever continuously liked something is 3 weeks) until I suddenly get bored of it, and doing it seems like a chore to me. I try to force myself to continue doing the things because I know that I like them, but it just becomes boring until I eventually just give up and stop doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, the other month my friend told me that she had recently started bullet journaling. I thought that it seemed really fun, and for about a week I really enjoyed doing it, but after a while I just got bored, and ripped it all out because it was stressing me out.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't particularly have any hobbies or passions, and overall I'm a pretty boring person, so I was wondering if it was just down to the fact that I'm a teen and haven't found anything I like enough to continue doing yet, or if there's something deeper to it.",14May2020,1

24,"This is a bit of a vent, be warned.

Literally since I was in middle school I have felt vaguely left out and lacking in friends. I had a group of friends but I always felt like they were better at building friendships with each other than I was at building a connection with them. Same thing happened in high school. I don’t know if this is a self-fulfilling prophecy or if I’m just bad at connecting or what. I do know that something that gets in the way is my extremely low self-esteem, which makes me feel like certain folks are out of my league, friend-wise. I just graduated from college and I feel like I only have superficial friendships and connections that I have to work REALLY hard to maintain. It’s exhausting and I feel like I’m only doing it to prove to myself that I have friends rather than out of a genuine desire to connect. I feel incredibly sad and jealous when I see other women my age who have been able to maintain friendships from all stages of their lives (childhood, high school, college, work, etc) and seem to have such a rich social existence. I, on the other hand, feel like I missed all my chances to make lasting friendships. And now I’m left with desperate weak connections to people I don’t relate to all that much. 

I’m sick of it. I don’t want to put in all that work and still end up feeling lonely anyway. I make myself crazy doing it. And I think I make myself more miserable by attaching all this meaning to whether or not I have friends and so, recently I’ve tried to just let it go. To just focus on other things and not freak out about ensuring that I hold onto these friendships lest I become what I already am- alone. I feel as though I might as well accept it and focus on myself and what makes me happy, and then maybe worry about friendship later in life when I’m in a better place. 

I honestly don’t know, I don’t want to end up friendless but I also know I can’t keep going the way I’m going- it’s superficial and doesn’t make me happy. So now I’m trying something new, I guess.",14May2020,1

I hope you are keeping well in this uncertain time. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, we are interested to hear about your transition to providing online therapy. We are a collaborative team of therapists and researchers from New York Psychoanalytic Institute (NYPSI) and Yeshiva University, New York, USA. We have developed two brief surveys; one survey for therapists and one survey for patients.

Your responses are anonymous, and the study has been approved by Western Institutional Review Board. The surveys should take approximately 15 minutes each. 

We would really appreciate it if you could fill it out and if you could distribute it to other therapists and patients who have transitioned to online therapy during the pandemic.

26,"INFO: Originally posted this in r/relationships but it got taken down and was recommended to post this here

 Start this off by saying I'm on mobile - sorry for formatting and throwaway because my boyfriend is an avid reddit user.

 My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 2 years. We've been living together for the majority of that time. (we both come from bad families and realized it was best that we both get out of our family situations asap). 

 My boyfriend is diagnosed bipolar and has very intense emotions in every way. He doesn't experience things casually, everything is all or nothing for him. Our biggest problem is that he doesn't communicate anything to me. At all. I have tried again and again to have conversations with him that just result in me getting the silent treatment (which I'm in currently) or aggressive yelling in my face and throwing things against the wall. Every time I've tried to talk to him about how his reactions make me feel, he breaks down crying, screaming and rolling on the floor about how he should kill himself and how terrible he his.

 For every time he has called me names, yelled at me, or broke something of mine, I have never received and apology. Communication is completely foreign to him. He spends his days hyper-analyzing everything I do from what I say, how I say it and when, which in turn causes me to apologize for things that I wouldn't need to apologize for normally. (a. e. The direction my knees are pointed, the way I open my computer, the position I lay my phone, how I get out of bed...)  it causes me to be extremely vigilant and conscious of everything I do or say to make sure I don't upset him. I am an avid communicator and have always told him when I'm upset, the reason behind it and how I'd like to move forward from it, so his constant calculations of my behavior are unwarranted.

 The reason for my post is an amalgamation of issues that have arisen over the last few days that I don't know how to navigate. He recently turned 21 and has been drinking incessantly. (he has been drinking for years but now has the legal ability to get it for himself so in turn is drinking a lot more) When he drinks, he becomes incredibly horny and wants to have sex constantly, I don't drink that often and have a relatively low libido to begin with (mainly as a result of his behaviors towards me subconsciously) and won't have sex with him if he's under the influence. Our sex while sober isn't good. He doesn't try to pleasure me and does not foreplay at all for me to feel comfortable so I just spend 10 minutes 3 times a week as a sex doll for him. I can count on one hand in our entire relationship that he has tried to pleasure me. His initiation for sex is that he comes up to me, and starts dry humping me and pushed me on the bed and it starts. (my discomfort with all of this has been communicated constantly and nothing in turn has resulted from it). 

 His behaviors while drunk are all of these things 100 times worsened, and last night was the straw that broke the camel's back. I was laying in bed around 2am falling asleep where he came up behind me, and very drunkenly started humping me very aggressively to which I told him 4 times that I didn't want to have sex and to get off of me. He flung himself onto the floor and screamed about how I find him unattractive and that I think his penis is small. I told him how this wasn't true and I was just really tired and he was really inebriated and he wasn't having it and started throwing stuff around the room. I just fell asleep.

 Today hasn't been any better, he's been tipsy for about an hour and already trying to initiate sex with me again and I'm thinking about just giving in and allowing him to have sex with me as to not deal with his reactions if I say no.

 I don't know where to go from here and if I try to initiate a conversation with him, he'll just scream at me and cry and I'll gave to apologize for making him upset. I can't do this anymore and need help on how to navigate this situation.

 (he is untreated with his bipolar because he doesn't have health insurance and hasn't had a job since January)

 I have a feeling he's going to find this post somehow and it will cause a problem. But I'm at the point where I don't know where else to go.

27,"I really want to keep this short because the topic drains me. I have struggled with depression and a number of disorders for years but my family never believed me even when I attempted suicide and was hospitalized for a week. I was only visited once by my mom when I was there. They’ve berated me all of my teen years for it. 
I currently live with my boyfriend and have almost completely cut my mom off save for texting every now and then but apparently these past few weeks she has been going to therapy with her husband and she wants me to start going to the same therapist. She said she would pay for it as well because I’m currently unemployed. 
I don’t know. I want to but I’m at a place in my life where I don’t want to think about my mental health. It’s only ever caused me problems and I truly do not want a relationship with my mom or her husband.",14May2020,1
28,"Hey! Just right off the bat I’d like to say I’m not looking for a diagnosis, only for people with shared experiences or knowledge on the subject!

I’ve already spoken to a GP regarding this issue and to be honest he didn’t seem to phased by it. “Come back if it happens again”. Maybe it’s more common then I originally thought or maybe he thought I was lying. Hopefully I’ll find a little more info here! 

To my knowledge this first started occurring at age 6 or 7. (It’s hard to describe exactly what happens when it occurs so please ask questions if you have any!) I would be normal, doing a mundane task ie... watching TV, listening to music or talking to someone... Then all of a sudden I would feel panicked and in danger out of the blue. From that point on EVERY noise I would hear would sound aggressive and angry. (It’s hard to picture I know) I’d feel like the anger was directed at me. This is especially true for sentences. If I was listening to music or watching TV my mind would pluck out a normal sentence and echo it over and over in my head. Every time it echoed it was twisted so it sounded louder and more aggressive like shouting from inside my head. Every sound I heard would just echo back and fourth in my head and get louder and louder and angrier until I was overwhelmed. 

I can’t remember how I used to stop them as a child, however, now I have to move myself to a quiet environment. I sit down and try and calm myself and focus on my breathing. After a few minutes it starts to slowly quite down and fade away. 

I would like to know if anyone else has had any experience with anything like this! Any advice or info would be greatly appreciated! 

Thanks for reading!

33,"I'm 17 male throwaway account, please for the love of God someone listen to me. When I started high school my mental health declined rapidly, depression+anxiety, the dynamic duo. This eventually led me into doing drugs. I went on this subreddit because reddit is annoying and has all these hoops I gotta jump through if I wanna find health advice so I came here because in reality mental health is really the reason I'm in the position I am. Now my drug of choice was marijuana (shocker) followed by nicotine but I dabbled in multiple others including psilocybin mushrooms, LSD, hydrocodone, codeine,  DXM, and of course alcohol. Those drugs were not the problem tho, marijuana was. See I was (and still am) incredibly depressed, and anyone with depression knows that when you are depressed you don't necessarily want to die, you just want the pain to stop and using your depressed rationality you conclude death is the only way to do that. Now fortunately I was never really into the whole suicide with guns or some other instant means of death so instead I took to my own means, which was vaping. Now I live in California so thc cartridges are easily accessible. It started sophomore year and basically up to a little while ago I never stopped smoking/vaping. I used just about anything I could get my hands on, and a lot of these included fake thc cartridges which as most people involved in vaping know is the cause of death in most if not all vaping-related deaths. Many of my friends made fun of me for knowingly buying these which didn't help. Well in short it looks like my bad decisions have caught up. My plan seems to be working. My health on a superficial level seems fine. But inside, I think I am dying. Breathing has become a chore. When I inhale it's almost never a full breath and my lungs never quite feel right. My throat too feels very strange. I have stopped all smoking/vaping/drug use for now as my mental health has improved due to Covid-19 and not having to deal with people and hey I don't really wanna fucking die at 17 so that's good I guess. I have been incredibly lonely for a very long time and have like 12 reddit accounts all discussing my health issues but they never get attention.  I also have gnarly back pain since I'm tall (6ft). And please please please please please do not remove this post, I will not write this again and if that happens it's very well a possibility I won't live much longer. Thanks yall. peace.",14May2020,1
34,"I've posted on Reddit about this a couple of times now, so I wanted to thank everyone in the Reddit community for all of their help and support. 

I (25m) have been in the same on and off relationship since I was 15. I've pushed everything and everyone out of my life for her, and the toll it has had on my mental health has left me broke, unemployed, and friendliness. I don't even have a real relationship with my family anymore. 

She suffers from borderline personality disorder and it feels like she switches between treating me like I mean nothing to her, and treating me like I'm the most special person in the world. Since we broke up for the first time, she has been in and out of many relationships but has always intentionally kind of kept me on the side lines. Even when we weren't in a relationship, she would express feelings towards me, and be very controlling of me. I never really moved on with my life. She's been my best friend, and my only friend. 

Just last year she told me that she had never fallen out of love with me, again, and admitted to using her current (now ex) boyfriend to make me jealous. We had briefly gotten back together, but she made a 180 on that really quickly, and suddenly just pushed me out of her life almost entirely. 

I've been extremely depressed all year, but I've been surviving on the hope that it would be temporary. 

I recently found out she's apparently engaged or already married to someone I do not even know. Someone Im almost sure she didn't even meet until after everything happened less than a year ago. 

I've been trying to talk to her, but shes completely ignoring me now, and I feel completely lost. I'm having severe suicidal ideations, and I know there are lots of resources out there to help, but I feel as if I either don't deserve to be happy, or as if I'm not supposed to be happy without her. The thought of being happy, but without her in my life, almost hurts me more than what I'm feeling right now. I still feel like I would be losing something that means everything to me and have put so much of my life into. Even if things do get better I don't see how they could ever be the same.

35,"Im not sure if this belongs here and im sorry if its not the right place. 
So Ive always had a lot of difficulty reaching climax during sex. Ive always assumed this is because of my depression and dopamine issues. My first psych med made it much more difficult to climax, which then essentially makes it impossible in bed. Im just starting another added psych med and im worried its going to make it even more difficult. I know i need to put my mental health first but this has always been such a self esteem issue with me. Im very open and try to express what helps me when im in bed, but its always futile.

I gained some weight. Last year, I had lost around 20 lbs, but have already gained it back once my depression hit again.

after some careful consideration I’ve decided that I want a semicolon tattoo on my wrist.

A semicolon tattoo is a tattoo of the semicolon punctuation mark (;) used as a message of affirmation and solidarity against suicide, depression, addiction, and other mental health issues.


The issue I’m currently having is that I’m not yet ready to openly talk about my own mental health and If someone were to ask what it means I would really know what to say.

39,"Hi... so I never really post to reddit I just kind of read the scary and mind blowing things on this app.. but its time to get a little serious. I just need an outlet of some kind and advice.

So I have noticed my boyfriend seeming far away, you know? I have always known that he is very prone to feeling overwhelming sadness. We have a really good life for be 20 somethings and we live together with our 3 beautiful (cat) children. I know that I bring him joy in certain ways and he is happy to be with me, but I feel that he is slipping further and further away.

He is one to have always counted on himself and never anyone else, very strong willed and driven by the thought of being successful. He was denied going to the college of his dreams because he is not a legal citizen of the United States ( which drives him crazy, and myself too because he is so smart and definitely worthy of being at any school he wants to go to) and whats even crazier is that he has lived here since he was probably around 1 year old. So this is one reason he is feeling down, as he has for the past 3 maybe 4 years since being denied this opportunity. This is definitely one of the events of his life that has started his journey of being possibly depressed. He does not want to become another ""statistic"", as he puts it. Right now, we are both servers. So in his mind, he is just another hard working Mexican in a restaurant. But let me tell you, this guy is good at anything he does so he often gets bored of jobs. If anyone could be amazing at being a server, call him the king. But he is getting bored, which is understandable. We were both going to enroll in college again, as we are both close to getting our associates in basics. We are finally in a good spot financially to go back and are pretty stable in life so it was finally a possibility. But then the \[issue that I can't mention without my post being removed so I am sure you will figure out what I mean LOL \] happened, and I feel this is round 2 of school being taken away from him, even though not as severe as the first time. Now he feels he is back at square one again.

So, all this leads up to the conversation we had the other day. He sometimes has trouble speaking to his emotions because he thinks that talking about it doesn't help. He says it won't help because every question he has for himself is answered with ""I don't know"". But he still talked to me anyways, which made me so proud of him because I know that I was asking him to do something really difficult.

I began our conversation with how I felt he was being distant, and he replied with how he is feeling. Which is that he is underwhelmed with life. That he is feeling like he has no feelings, as he put it. Nothing is making happy, or sad, or angry. Even though he said this, I can see that he is visibly sad. I think that sadness is primary, maybe his only feeling at this point. So basically he seems to be worried that he will never be able to feel love again and that he feels selfish and that he is returning to his old ways. Which his ""old ways"" are another story in itself, but can be summed up with that he worked really hard within himself and found a better version of himself before we started dating, which is a visible change. He changed the way handled situations and noticed that how he treated his ex was wrong, which is kind of amazing because true ""fuck boys"" would never admit their wrongs. I did know him 2 years before we stared dating and I knew his last girlfriend he had. Let me just tell you guys, that was soooooo toxic. They were both toxic to each other and I think they brought out the worst in each other and they were young at this point so I think he just thought of himself as a fuck boy for lack of a better term and that was who he was, even though he is so far from that.

But, in my unlicensed opinion, he seems depressed and lost mentally. Some signs of this are his loss of sex drive, over indulging in activities that help him escape such as gaming (like literally all day, and he never used to do that) , and how hard it is for him to get out of bed. Luckily, he doesn't have the need to drown out everything by substance abuse. On a selfish note, I feel lucky he isn't doing drugs other than smoking pot because my ex was a heroin addict and I could not help him and that drove me mental. But that is beside the point. I think that he is worried that he will never be successful in life, and that this is pretty much it for him. He also told me that he is worried that he didn't develop properly and that maybe he should be on his own. This seems to be something he is severely struggling with because I know he really doesn't want to leave me. I proceeded to tell him that if thats what would make him happy, or help him feel better, then he should. I also went on to explain that I am a supporting role in his life and that I am not here to get in his way of finding himself as I am also finding myself. We are partners, and we are growing as such, and that we could do this as a team, if he wanted. I told him that I am more than willing to just be here for him, and that I know that's all I can do. That I understand and that I am prepared to be here if he wanted me to be, which is what he seems to want the most I think. I am worried for him, I want to be here for him in anyway that I can be, even though I know it will be difficult but I know it will be worth it for me to try. Because let me tell you, that guy is my best friend and I love him with every fiber of my being. And even with him telling me all of this, his feelings for me haven't wavered because I see it in his eyes and the way he cares for me is somewhat out of character for the kind of person he is.. which he has always been very self- serving his entire life. I think thats a part of his defense mechanism he installed in his brain when he was a child as he really was alone because his siblings are more than 15 to 20 years older than him and his family never understood him because he is ""different"" I guess. Different meaning he doesn't and has never lived by ""standard"" in Mexican culture, as I am sure many people would understand this feeling, and his family could never understand this part of him.

So after all of this, I asked him if he would speak to somebody who is a professional and could help him with all of his "" I don't knows"" for they could help him answer them. He said he was open to it, which is super amazing and hopeful for him. He does not have insurance, so I asked my mother for some good resources and websites to look at and study. I think I've found someone and I really am hoping he will actually act on this.

I really am just posting this because I guess I needed to for myself. I am much better at writing out my feelings versus speaking about them to anyone because I can get across my point much better, which is why I began keeping a journal (I suggest a journal to others who have the same issue, LOL).

I am really trying to step up for him. I really meant what I said about if he had to leave then I would understand even though that might break me and my own mental stability for a while. But I just want him happy. I have my own mental struggles, we all do. But it is exceptionally hard for someone who is so strong willed and so confident and so successful ( at literally anything he does, like I cannot stress this enough) as my boyfriend. I am trying to be a really strong person for him, because thats what he needs. I am really not always a strong person and I am not very confident in myself but I am feeling this way, for real, for once, which is hopeful for me. I never feel this way. But I truthfully really do because the one thing I have always been confident in is how much I love him and how I know that I am the person that he needs, even if that means he leaves. I know he feels guilty because he knows that words can hurt me sometimes ( this is one reason he is afraid to talk about things but I always try to to explain that I am just a blubbering idiot who can't control tears and to ignore them when they come, but I know thats got to be hard to watch someone you care about cry at the words you say so I get it ) but I have reassured him that what he told me didn't hurt me, that it just made me sad for him because of how he was feeling, and that I truly understand what he needs is important. I told him that I am not afraid because I know that he is strong and can get through this and that I am also going to get through this. I think that fighting to help someone you love, no matter how heartbreaking, is worth it especially if you know they are the one for you. He has taught me so much, as I have taught him so much. The only promise I made to myself entering this uphill battle is not to lose myself, and to still try to find out who I am inside in the midst of all of this. I am truly feeling positive because I know he is insanely strong and I know that he loves me, no matter the outcome of our relationship.

um.. I guess if you actually read this whole thing, thank you for listening to me... I really needed it. Also if you have any advice for me that would be cool too. Have a great day, and always fight to save the ones you love.

TLDR; The summary is that my boyfriend is most likely struggling with depression and may leave me if things get too rough for him, I am trying to help him through this and I am hoping that our love is strong enough as I think that it is... I am willing to run the mile with him if thats what he wants and I am also willing to end things if thats what he needs. this post is just an outlet for me to write out my feelings about it all and is best explained in detail.

45,"I recently got diagnosed with depression and anxiety I always felt sad but I thought I was just a baby. I’ve missed so much school at this point people basically think I’m lazy and I’m loosing friends because I’m never there to see them. Basically long story short school is the worst thing in my life. So as you can probably imagine I was over the moon when I found out I wouldn’t have to go to school and I could do all my work on zoom at home. But it’s just as bad.

When I’m not at school I sleep and I don’t eat much. I have really bad insomnia and iron deficiency so I can not sleep for 30 hours and then sleep for 16 then lay in bed for an extra 3 hours awake because I’m so tired. I’ve had medication for the insomnia and iron deficiency but it made me feel so sick and my sleep got worse and I got headaches. 

Anyways now I have online school it’s even worse than real school. I just feel stupid because my desk is at the end of my bed. I fall asleep at 6-7 am most days and wake up around 2 my parents really strict so they usually let me sleep in. 

The worst thing is I have a friend who had depression before I don’t think she does now but i don’t know I don’t really show it to my friends maybe she doesn’t either but I don’t think she believes me. I’m quiet when I’m not with my friend but I’m confident when I’m with them and really loud.

I’ll start with saying I’m a 26 year old dentist, haven’t found a job for almost a year now, ever since I graduated was never able to find anything, not for lack of trying, or being lazy, I genuinely can’t find a job. 
The fact that I can’t find a job really disappoints me, the way my family looks at me like the way you look at a sick puppy, and that’s the thing I really hate and it just makes me sick to stomach.

I can’t sleep sometimes, I just over think everything that happens through out my day, once I’m alone at night I really just feel sadness and I feel like I’m a failure, maybe I’m too harsh on myself, but I feel like I just lost my confidence. 
I’m always congratulating people on there success, and I just can’t succeed, I’m always helping people in taking the next step in there relationships and I failed in mine, I can’t talk to anyone because I don’t want anyone to see me as weak or broken, I know it’s not the best solution but smoking weed helps from time to time, but it’s only a temporary fix.

48,"Whenever I want to ask advice or perspective on life I always get too anxious to ask other people. I’m mostly scared of getting rejected or judged or if they start talking behind my back because I opened up to them. Or just an answer I won’t feel good about hearing in general. 

I have this fear of opening up because my parents have talked about my siblings behind my back in front of me. They both had abusive boyfriends and left home around my age which my parents felt like was too young. My parents would talk about why they would do that and even when one of my sisters came back to get her masters they would say that she should have done it earlier while she was working on it. They were proud after the fact but they could’ve left her mistakes alone. There’s no point it’s over with. 

People make mistakes and learn from them. What matters is that they come out of it and become a better version of themselves. I just have this fear that my parents will or have already talked about me behind my back about my short comings or mistakes involving anything in my life. 

So much so that I can’t nap during the day if I hear mumbling because I keep thinking it’s about me. I feel like it has affected my relationships with people. I have a hard time being vulnerable with my friends. Neither I or  my friends have ever really talked about anything personal, emotional, or serious. Maybe a lot but rarely. 

Whenever I have problems and I need someone to talk to I can’t bring myself to do it. I’m too scared to ask anything. I’m just afraid that they may not know what to say and you’d just be sitting there feeling awkward for ever bringing that up. 

Truthfully this runs a little deeper than my parents but back in middle school when I was going through a really bad depression. I felt like no one cared even when I tried opening up to friends. They weren’t really there for me and they were shitty friends and now I’m afraid of getting too emotional because I don’t want to come off like I’m having a mental break down and that I’m too much to handle so I kept to myself more often and it worked for years. Now I feel like I’m the only one dealing with my own problems and turmoils and I can’t ask for advice of those same fears.

I had some friends in highschool that were also like that but I won’t bother with the details. I guess I just haven’t been lucky with my friendships.

They were my safe place and all I had but slowly one by one my cats either died, disappeared or we had to give them away. It crushed me. I was super sensitive. I would cry at everything. Ever since then something changed in me and I can no longer cry that much at all. Maybe a few tears at a time. I have a hard time expressing my emotions and I've never been taught anything about emotions. I only know what I've learned by myself and it's not a whole lot. I just feel like my life over the years has just slowly crashed into the ground and idk what to do anymore. 

Has anyone else had a tragic event change them from a young age?",14May2020,1
52,"hello I have no formal diagnosis but have considered myself generally mental my whole life , I have had symptoms for many mental illnesses at some point in my life which I now believe were situational whereas now my life is stable and I have no valid reason to be unhappy I still am + have been for a while , I want a formal diagnosis because I have gotten myself through a lot and am now on the verge of sanity or normality lmao and I think I owe myself to find out what’s truly wrong with me so I can aim on getting better , i haven’t been diagnosed before bc I have hidden my mental instability from those around me and my parents don’t believe in mental illness diagnosis unless severe trauma has occurred ( which it has but I never told them 😏) and think I’m just dramatic so I haven’t been able to seek help from them , I’m now 16 so I can go to a doctor myself but I’m not sure how I can get a referral to a psychiatrist to get a diagnosis that I have needed for years , I’m hoping someone who has used the nhs system in the uk to get a diagnosis before could help me by commenting how I get a referral to a psychologist + what to say so they take me seriously bc I’m scared they won’t as I have survived so long without “help “ they might think I don’t need it . I’m also wondering if anyone can help me avoid the cahms system because I worry they will infantilise me and not take me seriously , is there anyway I can be diagnosed as an adult ?

53,"i am 18m from new york. im in a happy relationship of 2 years that is only now becoming extremely unstable because of my inability to think about anything. i literally have not had a single thought in my life and my mind is always empty, all i ever do is do or say immediately and i never think about consequences or plans or morals or anything. i only ever impulsively do anything that comes to mind. in conversation i lie constantly to people i care about without thinking at all because i just avoid conflict. the closest thing i ever have to an actual thought is thinking of something i want to do and then not being able to do it so i think about it until i can do it, after that my mind is blank again. i can never remember things im told to do or things i need to do. i can only ever remember facts and random things that dont matter and never come up unless someone else asks me. i dont have an imagination, i never have any ideas unless i got them from someone else and im using them. i know how to do things and i can do them but i can never innovate, never change anything, never remember, and never think before i say or do anything ever. 

my life has come down to sleeping constantly because im bored and there isnt anything that immediately comes to mind to do and i never remember things i should be doing or that i need to do because i dont think. my girlfriend is on the verge of leaving me because she cannot handle dishonesty when im not actively trying to hurt her or trying to lie to her, i just say things without thinking and the things i say are always extremely dismissive lies that avoid conflict. i repeatedly hurt myself or get in legal trouble for things that i compulsively do without thinking of consequences or rules or other people.",14May2020,1
54,So for as long as I can remember I’ve never really felt guilty or grief or sad that a family member died or anger or frustration but not too long ago my emotions just showed up and today everything just came flooding back to me memories of my mother abusing me how my teahers used to belittle me how much I was bullied and I even remembered my mother confessing to abuse me to the family and since about when i was about 11 I started being able to fight back then my mother took me out of school (I think cause the little boy she used to have so much power over grew into a person that could fight back) and when I ask her about going back to school she tries to Dodge the question I’m 15 now haven’t spent a day in school for 4 years I’m confused and scared for my future and on top of that about six months ago me and my mom got in a fight at a relatives place and I slapped a sandwich out of her hand and they somehow concluded that I’M ABUSING MY MOTHER (I’m a pretty big guy btw) and I’m intimidating when yelling but that bitch was one of the people my mother confessed to so I have no idea what the hell im supposed to do so I joined this this place,14May2020,1

I’ve had plenty of thoughts on cutting myself, I constantly doubt what I’m going to say in fear of being shut out from people, I have a hard time conveying or telling others how I feel, and I can switch from happy to mad faster than you can say spaghetti. But I just don’t know what to think, I’m scared and I want to talk to a therapist but I don’t want to tell others what I think because they might think I’m psychotic but I want to kill myself because I’m not going to amount to anything but I want to become part of an orchestra professionally but I never would be able to do it because I can never fully commit to anything.",14May2020,1

57,"So I am young and will not state my age but not important. I have thought about writing here for awhile now bc of my thoughts right now and before. I have gained an urge when I am out in public about the thought of hitting strangers or what it would be like to hurt them and honestly it has calmed down but it comes back here and there which I feel is more because of movies and videos I have seen but don’t worry I know I don’t have the guts to actually try it since I know I’m a hypocrite and a coward. I am always paranoid out in public and at home thinking that there are people watching me or trying to get to me even though I know that it isn’t real and it’s just my over active imagination but I can’t help but look around. When I’m out in public, I feel like everyone’s looking at me when I pass by or judging me which I try to ignore but it keeps on getting to me and I honestly annoy myself and tell myself to think of other things like what I am doing or just fidgeting or looking at the floor. Sorry if this is wasting any of your time but I just want to lay some thoughts and not all. Since this is reddit I’m sure that this good for me to use. Recently other thoughts have come to me and I’ve found something that I feel disturbed by which is physical and I don’t want to live a life with it unless I know I can remove it. I also hate myself for being a hypocrite and for my procrastination problem. I have procrastinated since Elementary on work and sometimes very easy things like cleaning some things or finishing things that sometimes have a long deadline like a month or so to the point where I have become a constant liar and spew out lies which some people have been able to see through and others haven’t and I feel regretful but also get a rush and relief momentarily.

65,"Hi all! As the title says, I'm a bit of a mess right now.
Mid-panic attack and slightly dissociative so I apologize for errors.

Cross-posting on cholinergic urticaria and health anxiety because I don't know where else to turn to. Sorry to everyone and wishing you all the best.

Life has become very isolated and restricted lately and its definitely taking its toll. 

I have an allergy that is brought on by stress, anxiety, heat, and spicey food. 'm on xolair to help control reactions, 2x 180mg allegra and 2x pepcid to treat my CU that's gotten worse since mono last year. Also have my gallbladder out, and Hashimoto's, which is autoimmune and affects my thyroid.

Tried talking to my doctor about debilitating anxiety, food restrictions, and not leaving my house for 9 months now due to how easily triggered my CU is. He was dismissive as CU didn't typically present with anaphylaxis or food allergies in adults. Well I also didnt have it so severe before or autoimmune issues, which I know are making me worse.

Didnt start the xolair until a couple months ago, at which point I couldn't walk to my car without full blown hives, or even have anything with something as simple as pepper on it without my lips/eyes swelling.

The angioedema is recent this year, so far it hasn't seemed to be in my mouth or throat. Also have had dizziness to the point of darkened vision, confusion, tremors, gastric issues, overheating, and flushing with hives during more severe outbreaks that have mostly happened this year just walking to class compared to over 10 years of having CU.

I legit feel like I'm going crazy. I can't eat even simple meals of rice, fish, fruit or veggies without panicking that I'm going to swell up or pass out and die. The panic attacks themselves last for hours and bring mild regular flushing to my upper arms despite the treatments, so I know my reactions are still breaking through and that makes it worse. I worry what that means if I can't afford to stay on treatment and how severe it will be again. Even just having dry or itchy skin makes me panic.

I'm traumatized just by the constant feeling of my body being under threat this year alone and obsessively worrying about dying and not living.

I dont know if this will kill me b/c of my symptoms or the stress (which is it's own trigger for CU) and not knowing what my new normal is or when to realistically worry/avoid is torture.
I've had to drop out of school, cut out any exercise (another trigger) and so much food, and I've become an agoraphobic mess to the friends and family I still have around.

If anyone has any advice on what else to say or who to see, please help!!!",14May2020,1
66,I’m always thinking about the same thing and it’s driving me insane. For 2 years. My brain has been on a loop just going around on circles. I’ve become what feels to be inadequate in life. And I’m so young. I don’t get this??? Guys seriously. There’s something wrong. Sexually I’m almost numb keeping a straight face but can still release. I don’t rly feel much emotion 24/7. And it’s because no matter what I’m doing MY BRAIN WONT STOP. My brain doesn’t rly react to things or process them as they happen. Sometimes later on I choose to reflect on them though but that just gets stressful. My brain just tells me it’s pointless because I’m not normal. What the heck is this??? Someone in phycology familiar with this? Because I’m so over it. It’s like I’m always in a state of panic but tepid at the same time. HOW the heck is there any saving me at this point. The worst part is. I think this has been happened since childhood and is just increasingly getting worse. I’m 18 and I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m never going to live a normal life.

I am experiencing supposed paranoid schizophrenia (see above link), I believe I am depressed, and I have major anxiety. My parents are the main factor in telling me things that do not help the situation. I feel like a burden to other people, mainly my friends, which is why I have lost contact with most of them after failed communication. I do not want to go into specifics but many other factors come into play such as my moving to another state.

I want to talk to a therapist/psychiatrist, but the last time I told my parents I thought I was depressed (back in March), my father kept watching TV while making stupid comments on what I was telling them, and my mom lied to me about contacting a therapist. All while I had a mental breakdown in the living room. At this point, (and other failed attempts) I have decided I’d get no help from them. I want to talk to a therapist, but I don’t have the money for it. If anyone is willing to help out, I have a Venmo I can use to pay for an online therapist,(in my bio) or if anyone is/knows a therapist I can talk to for free, that would also be very much appreciated.",14May2020,1
68,"i was diagnosed twice with OCD and know just how much it destroyed my life, after taking meds for a few years i have been remissive for quite sometime, i now got another assessment last week and was told i didn't have OCD.

I am feeling suicidal and dismissed, OCD is something that wreaked havoc on my life and suddenly it is no longer on my list of diagnosis, i feel this is an injustice as to what i was suffering with. I have again in the past 24 hours started thinking about suicide and experiencing suicidal ideation, i want to end it because it is not fair they took a diagnosis that was so close to home away from me. I know i personally have mental illness, but now they wanna say i don't have mental illness and instead i have ''Autism''. i was diagnosed by a multi team of specialists last week with far more credentials than the people i saw a few years ago. I called my doctor 5 times today who has not yet gotten the report and i asked him if he could please keep Anxiety on the list and not remove it, he said it will depend on what the report says, i also called my psychologist 3 times pleading with them.

I know i have Autism, but i also have OCD, OCD destroyed me and my life and without medication i would've long ago died of suicide.

I've never been the most likeable person if I'm honest with myself. I used to be extremely manipulative. I lied about everything just to get a bit of attention, but after moving schools, moving houses, and starting fresh, nothing has gotten better. I know I'm not the most enthusiastic nor expressive person, but I thought moving and starting fresh would change things. I've found that despite my flat and borderline assholey personality (I've come to realize I can be quite unintentionally jaded about things) I have lots of friends. I know most people at my school and I'm on good terms with almost everyone. I even started volunteering at a camp and I met some really cool people. But the more people I surround myself with the more I feel alone. I feel like im just there. Another person that people say hi to in the hallway and nothing more. The worst part is that the two people in close with seem to not feel the same about hoe close we are. These two girls (let's say Anna and Jackie because I dont know what else to call them) are really cool and I love spending time with them. I test Jackie almost everyday and we have what has now become short conversations. We used to talk all day. It's gotten to the point where I've developed feelings for Jackie.

Back story, I had a lot of issues with depression when I was in high school. I'm 28 now, so it's been a while. Tried to kill myself a few times, psych ward, the whole nine. But I've been good with that stuff for a while now. Lately though, I've been thinking about what I consider to be paranoia. But thinking about it more, I'm thinking it might be anxiety instead. Hell I'm not even sure if there's a difference. Lol. I get paranoid about a lot of things. I don't speed cuz I'm worried about getting pulled over and getting a ticket. I get paranoid when my boss talks to me at work that I'm going to get fired, even if I've done nothing wrong. When I was dating people, I would get paranoid constantly that they were tired of me or that they were going to dump me or that they were cheating. I don't drink but maybe once a year because I'm paranoid that I'll do something stupid while drunk or hurt myself or someone else. I don't do any kind of drugs because I'm paranoid about becoming addicted or again doing something stupid on them. I don't like anything that alters my mindset in any way. Because I'm paranoid that something bad will happen. I worry about my friends going out with people they don't know cuz I'm paranoid they're gonna get raped or sold into human trafficking or some shit. 
I know all this sounds stupid, but its what's constantly running through my head all the time. And I know I say paranoid, because that's how it feels. But I feel like technically its anxiety not like paranoid personality disorder? I've never been abused or beaten or anything, but I'm constantly keeping track of exits anywhere I go, because I'm worried something bad is going to happen. I have constant plans forming in my head for ALL possibilities of anything bad happening. I'm constantly making new plans and backup plans and backup backup plans. I come up with plans for the most off the wall shit, you would laugh if you heard some of them. But its constantly running through my mind. And to be quite honest, its exhausting. I have trouble getting to sleep at night because I can't stop thinking and planning and rerunning through conversations I had that day or conversations I wanted to have that day.

79,"Hi guys. This is more of a rant, but I have no where else to able talk with but here. I hope y’all understand.


My mental health has been declining since this shelter in place. I have had mental health problems in the past.


I have started to wanting to cry everyday since about last week. I just want to burst out crying, but since I have roommates I can’t. Many things have brought me up to this.


First, my roommates has been ignoring the shelter in place order. I live in SF, btw. They keep on letting in guests and multiple times I have said them to stop. They have recently decided not to, because I asked one of the other roommates became a mediator. All of the roommates doesn’t seem to take this situation seriously and blame me that I am breaking their friendships/relationships. I am the sole roommate that has been enforcing these. It’s like an battle without any supporters. It’s just exhausting. Everyday it feels like I am being watched for any flaws that they can blame me. It’s so stressful.


Second, I don’t have income. I have unemployment, but recently my restaurant job decided to reopen for takeout orders. But my boss told me that I might not be rehired during this period since they are only taking limited amount of crew members. And if I do get rehired, I won’t be working the same hours I did before, which covered my expenses. I don’t know if I should be even work in that environment, since I am afraid to contract the virus working and commuting there. I don’t have healthcare. The tests are free, but the treating cost is not. 


Third, I miss my family. My family lives in Japan, and I am a dual citizen (Japan and US). Japan only allows dual citizenship till 22, then you have to decide. I am turning 22 very soon. I know I should choose US, based on my career, but it still sucks. All of my family lives in Japan. And not being able to visit them freely is just painful. I also love being in Japan, and have considered working there too. I know it’s not the end of doing that if I chose US, but it will be difficult. I also haven’t seen my family for 3yrs, including my 80 year old grandma. I was able to call her for the first time in a while, but the call made me miss her more and everything about Japan. I fear that if she gets the virus, I will never be able to see her ever again. My dad is also pretty old with some medical conditions. He raised me as a single father, and I haven’t been able to give him back yet. I just want to be by their side. I miss them so much, more then ever. 


Fourth, my career. I am in college and hoping to graduate next semester. I am in the filmmaking industry, but the current situation is just making me more nervous about my future. I have been trying to work on editing projects but I just can’t concentrate. I don’t know why.

Click off reddit to start opening the document, then remember that I don't have the right color foundation right now and go online and start shopping for one.

84,"I just put on some Metallica as I can't sleep and usually listen to something at night (though enjoyment isn't always there). I haven't listened to then since middle school/early highschool, I thought what the hell let's revisit an old favorite. It brought me back to a moment in HS health class, our teacher had out on Master of Puppets as an illustration of cocaine addiction and how it was the staple of the 80s. This memory also brought back that she was also on of our gym teachers and she made a joke about drinking for stress during warm ups, she followed it up with ""isn't that right DabusAlmighty?"" I went along with it and said ""it'll take the pain away"" she chuckled and moved on. My (not so stellar) friend then said ""wow she knew to make that joke specifically at you....cringe"". She knew.....she knew I wasn't exactly the poster child for mental health, for happiness. So did my English teacher, she not so subtly hinted that I should take lessons from the a book we were assigned once (book wasn't too far off from my experience even if it didn't deal with my central stressor). As did my middle school English teacher... She straight up told the counselor I was depressed. On another occasion occasion she said I would be a life coach later in life...the implication being I've been through some shit. I guess that's who I am. I am a neurotic and I am what I am today because of that. Am I destined to always be ......maybe. Seems to be the way it goes for a lot of folks. Certainly for folks like Marc maron (one of my face comedians) who corroborates the idea that depression and issues never really go away you just have to learn to manage it forever. IDK but I sure as hell the road so far. I was also not such an attentive kid in elementary. I hate that my brain is probably impaired for years (perhaps irreversibly) by all the bs through the years. That stress has either given me what essentially is Alzheimer's and ADHD or intensified my actual adhd if I have it. It's hard to tell, but slot is explained if I do. I didn't have a good time those years. And I won't for a handful more at least since now I gotta deal with the mess it's left me in.

85,"For the first few years of my life, I couldn't walk. I had low muscle tone and had ligaments that didn't work properly, so nothing restricted my range of motion. I had breathing problems and heart issues. When I was three, my dad went to prison and my family fell into poverty. My older siblings locked me in my room for hours, punishing me for things I didn't do, only letting me out when my mom got home. This went on for five years. When I was in the second grade, my dad chocked me and CPS got involved, luckily the didn't take me or my siblings from our mom. In third grade, I started getting bullied. In fifth grade, I moved and found myself without friends. By this point, my relationship with my dad had recovered and he became my support system, even though we only saw each other six days out of the month. Bullying became severe, and my siblings constantly called me fat and ugly, past the point of mere teasing and comedy. Starting middle school, bullying continued, but I did find a group of friends. My dad started heavily drinking. He became emotionally abusive, and he would start playing these pain games. He would twist my, or my siblings arms. He wouldn't stop, even when we cried and begged him to stop. He was still my support system during this as my mom was uninvolved with my life, I was the definition of a middle child. Seventh grade saw me cut off from my dad except for one day a month. By this point, my interests in books, movies, and music, all were similar to his and we bonded over it. He wasn't the best, but he was the only one I had to talk to my interests with. I dealt with anorexia and dropped to a BMI of thirteen. A week before I started the eighth grade, my dad was found dead due to liver failure from the alcohol. I wasn't able to enjoy anything we bonded over anymore and lost the few things that made me, me. That year had been the worst for bullying yet. My mom was still mostly uninvolved, I got beat up frequently by my older siblings. I became suicidal. I had been doing sports during this entire middle school era, but things ht the fan during volleyball. I became extremely anxious on top of unrelenting sadness. I would have emotional breakdowns after every game. Around this time, I found music that I liked and latched on to it being became my only escape. I stated losing friends during this era as well, they all stopped associating with me. I started suffering from insomnia. I had always had sleeping trouble, but never to that degree. The summer following that eighth grade, I started recovering. I stopped feeling so anxious, the sadness was no longer crushing me. I started hanging out with my friend group again. At the end of that summer however, I started falling back into the sadness. Starting ninth grade, I wasn't great, but I was better than the year before. I started drawing, I found a new love for books and movies. I got bullied worse than ever, but I finally had a good support system in my friends. My mom made me dress in skirts and crop tops, she didn't care how much I hated how I looked in them. She started to give me attention, but it was to point out my flaws. I started gaining weight as I had been too light before. My metabolism was very slow due to the under eating, and resulted in me from going to a size double zero, all the way to a six. The anxiety became worse. The main cause of this was due to sexual harassment I received from a teacher. My mom started to acknowledge me, but it was to tell me to peruse art as a career. That seems fine, that she was being supportive, but in reality, she knew that I hated the idea of turning art into a career. For as long as I can remember, I've wanted to be an engineer. I had been taking the right classes, getting the right grades for it since I had the option. I started dressing myself against my moms wishes. I dressed in a lot of black with band tshirts. At some point, I had a really bad emotional breakdown in front of my mom I confided in her about some of what I dealt with. She took the opportunity to tell me that I had to change the way I dressed. I'm still in ninth grade, and things are starting to slide back. I am not happy, I'm anxious, I can't sleep, and I haven't been eating enough. I've dropped twenty pounds in the last month.

86,"\*\*Deep read ahead\*\*

I wish I could just take a break from everything, just this day to day stress about my life, about where I am going, what I'm supposed to do, will I ever be able to free myself of this monthly cycle of earning a salary and consuming all of it just to pay bills. With every passing day, I feel like I’m not headed anywhere. Stuck in a dead-end job, which I can’t wait to get out of. It’s probably not the worst in the world, but definitely not something that makes me happy. But why do I do it? It pays the bills. I have retired parents who spent all of their little money on educating me and my sibling and now all I do, is just try to keep a job that I absolutely disgust from the bottom of my heart, just so I can support them. 

I am a single 27-year-old guy, and have been single for quite some time. I’m not a greek god but I’m not that bad either. I had my high school sweetheart leave me after 7 years for reasons I couldn’t comprehend. I have seen a few people briefly post her but I find myself going back to my first relationship. Just because things were so easy back then. I didn’t have to worry about money (not a lot anyway), I didn’t have to be on call 24/7 for work that doesn’t even excite me. 

On the outset, it may seem like I’m living the life everyone wants to live, at least in a third world country anyway. A decent job in banking, enough money to not seem broke to people around me. All I can do every month, is just make my rent, pay my family’s bills, pay for my student loans, have a couple of good outings, and that’s about it. I honestly don’t know if I’ll ever have enough money to have my own family or get my own house. I know those probably aren’t very lofty goals but for someone who has spent his life in rented accommodations, I really looked forward to having my own place one day. 

What really eats my heart out is seeing people 10-15 years senior to me doing this everyday of their lives. I cannot possibly fathom myself being one of them. And to get out of this, I need to take risks, maybe start something of my own. I know there is a massive chance that it might never work out, but I just won’t be able to forgive myself if I don’t try. But for that, I will have to leave the security of a job, which means putting not just myself in that uncertainty (which I am surprisingly okay with) but my parents too. Who, are in crippling poverty, not knowing where their evening bread is going to come from. I cannot leave them to that uncertainty. 

I don’t have any aspect of my life working out right now (and for the past 2-3 years, haha) for me. It’s not like I’m in depression and don’t want to live. I just want to know that it gets better. That things will work out. That there will be a day when I have finally beaten the monthly cycle of salary and bills. That I won’t live my life alone. I am just at a loss of wits. I just wish I had at least one part of my life figured out. 

Yeah, I play video games online whenever I can, talk to friends but I am not really comfortable telling them this really disturbed side of me. I am generally not a very expressive person but also I don’t want someone’s pity. I want a way out, because right now there is no end in sight for any of it. I guess all I am looking for is hope. 

I know it’s been pretty heavy stuff but I didn’t really know how to put this mental turmoil to rest, and I would like to believe this helped. Thanks guys.",14May2020,1

I am experiencing supposed paranoid schizophrenia (see above link), I believe I am depressed, and I have major anxiety. My parents are the main factor in telling me things that do not help the situation. I feel like a burden to other people, mainly my friends, which is why I have lost contact with most of them after failed communication. I do not want to go into specifics but many other factors come into play such as my moving to another state.

I want to talk to a therapist/psychiatrist, but the last time I told my parents I thought I was depressed (back in March), my father kept watching TV while making stupid comments on what I was telling them, and my mom lied to me about contacting a therapist. All while I had a mental breakdown in the living room. At this point, (and other failed attempts) I have decided I’d get no help from them. I want to talk to a therapist, but I don’t have the money for it. If anyone is willing to help out, I have a Venmo I can use to pay for an online therapist,(https://venmo.com/code?user_id=3006921644703744489) or if anyone is/knows a therapist I can talk to for free, that would also be very much appreciated.",14May2020,1
88,"I originally posted this on r/DID, but it’s a smaller subreddit and I thought I could get more help here. I have DID. (Formerly known as MPD, or Multiple Personality Disorder). Although I hate the term “multiple personalities” because it’s really more than that. It’s like a bunch of different people living in one body.

anyways, this is the rest of my rant:

the hosts in my system are both named Brian, but they share a lot of the same feelings on this so I’m just going to refer to them as Brian singular.

basically, my name’s Jamie. I’ve been around for the last 8 years, and if it were up to me I’d be a host, just like Brian. They already co-host, so why can’t I also be a host? I’ve got my own things going on outside the headspace and I have to fight to be able to do anything out there.

I’m just so fucking sick and tired of Brian’s bullshit. They monopolize their time in the body and I haven’t even gotten to talk to our therapist. Yeah. To be fair, we’ve only had like 20 sessions so far, and there’s 11 others in our system. But still, I want to talk to the therapist. Brian (and even to an extent the others) say that the Hosts, and the Alters with the most trauma should get priority.

so because I don’t have trauma I don’t matter? What, do I have to go witness a traffic accident for them to take me seriously?

and just the way that Brian talks about us and the system. I’m referring to them as singular only to make it less confusing, but they only ever say “I”. Just the fact that they don’t acknowledge we’re a system or say “we” just goes to show how much they care about us and me.

I don’t want to be locked in the fucking hesdspace. I can’t stand their arrogance and their little notes. If they see that another Alter was fronting they immediately interrogate me. I want to be a part of the outside too.

and their little love/hate relationship is so fucking tedious. 

they say that I can’t front because I might expose the fact that Brian is 2 alters (they have this stupid thing where they pretend to be the same person), and Brian #2 gets so uptight whenever I tell him that it would just be so much simpler if they told people the truth. Instead they lie to everyone and make all our lives miserable.

Brian #2 literally called me a whore the last time I was out. Yeah. I’ll admit, I’m open, friendly, and sometimes even a little flirty by nature. I’m pretty sure Brian #2 is just jealous that people actually like me.

they keep bringing up the one time I asked one of their friends out. So what? They said no, and that was the end of it. Why is it such a big deal?

Brian #1 always seems to make me feel like I’m this big, bad, destructive force too. He’s a scaredy-cat, and just assumes that the moment that Brian loses control, everything will go to hell.

they have serious control issues.

and I know I sound bitter. That’s because I am. I want to have a life outside of the headspace, I don’t want to be locked away and judged constantly. Is that really too much to ask for?

and I’m mad at the others too. NONE of them stick up for me. Maybe they think I’m a loose canon too?

thing is, Brian doesn’t freak out as much when most of the others come out occasionally. It’s just me. 

and do you think either of them would listen to me? Noooooooo

I’m just hoping that y’all leave enough lecturing comments for them to read later that they finally take me seriously.",14May2020,1

90,I didn't know where else to post but there are certain things that I've seen recently that literally made me have a full blown panic attack. I don't ever remember seeing this show in my life but it makes me feel incredibly unsafe and just typing this and thinking about it makes me anxious. Why is this happening,14May2020,1
91,"It's the worst.

I struggle with very severe RSD so I'm sure it's tied to that somehow...because when I try to say something to someone and I don't get a response I get this awful feeling of rejection and failure.

If it's just a stupid meme or video I found online and sent to some friends and no one reacts, that's not that bad.  But when I try to actually talk about things like my own feelings or interests, or share something I created like a picture I took, and *that* gets ignored or overlooked...that really gets to me, because that's *mine*, it's coming from *me.*

I'm...not all that great.  I'm pretty useless and not particularly cool or interesting.  All I have to offer the world is my words.  Sharing my thoughts on things, talking about my interests or my feelings.  I guess when that gets taken away i feel so awful and like I really am as invisible as I always feel.

It makes me constantly second guess my friends and family and worry that they find me annoying or irritating or that they outright don't care about anything I have to say or even hate me and want me to shut the hell up.  I've explained to people how much this stuff hurts and how much simple acknowledgement can sooth and reassure me but it doesn't really work, a lot of what I say to a lot of people still gets overlooked and I feel like a damn idiot talking to myself most the time.

I think one of the worst feelings in the world for me is feeling unwanted, uncared for, like I don't matter, invisible.  I think all this really causes and/or exacerbates those feelings and that's why it's so excruciating.

I don't know if this even makes any sense because I'm lying in bed falling asleep as I type this, sorry.  But it sucks and I'm sad.",14May2020,1
92,"I’ve suffered from anxiety my whole life.  When I was a child I was having trouble even being able to function at school.  Because of this I had a lot of trouble making friends and felt pretty isolated my whole childhood.  After years of therapy and support though I’ve been able to get to a point where I can feel almost normal.  I still have anxiety attacks and outbursts but they have not been as severe.  I owe a huge part of that to my friends, when I’m talking with them and sharing a laugh that’s when I’m able to feel good about myself.  When I’m not around people and I’m alone with my thoughts that’s when I can wander into stress or dark thoughts.  

All of this is basically leading to the fact that for the past few months I’ve really been struggling.  Without my supports systems I fear I’ve regressed and my anxiety attacks have become much more severe.  Late at night or early in the morning the reality if the situation the world is facing can hit me and it’ll send me into a panic where I have trouble breathing and I start bashing my head with whatever’s closest to me.  I’ve gotten a lot of bruises in my head from it and I just hate this cycle.  Just the shitty news that’s coming in from all angles is making me feels worse and worse, I just want this to be over, but there’s no sign of when that will be.  When things will be over keeps getting pushed farther and farther back and it makes it feel like it will never end, which makes me feel trapped and that there’s no escape.  Which just makes me want to punch myself in the face even more.  

I’ve had a lot more trouble enjoying myself too.  Most of my hobbies and passions require being around people so it isn’t like I can focus on those to get me through this.  People often say that we “Just have to watch netflix” but at a certain point all the leisurely activities I used to enjoy stopped being enjoyable.  I no longer have fun playing games, watching shows, reading books, there isn’t anything I can do to distract me.  Which would make you think ai could just focus on my schoolwork but I just am not able to.  No matter how hard I try I just cannot find any motivation to do any of my schoolwork.  I was a perfectly good student before all of this but for some reason the quarantine has just prevented me from being able to get my work done.  It just makes me feel like a failure and that I don’t deserve good things and that I’m a piece of shit.  

Also not being able to see my friends has been a huge detriment as well.  Whenever something was giving me anxiety joking about it with my friends would often make it better.  When I get stressed about a problem I have trouble getting perspective on the situation, I just focus on that problem.  Seeing people and joking about it helped put it in perspective and would make me feel better.  Now that I’ve lost that all I have left is the problem for my mind to focus on and I just feel trapped.  This isn’t helped by the fact that I am abysmal at texting and phone calls.  I’ve tried communicating with my friends through call and text but it just makes me feel worse because I can’t fully communicate myself, and that just makes me feel more trapped.  

I’m sorry fir the ramble, my issues are not nearly as severe as many other peoples.  Compared to most people I’m fucking lucky.  I don’t have to pay rent, I don’t have a job at stake, I come from a finically stable family.  I realize I just sounds like a whinny bitch but I just need to get this out there.  I don’t want to get things back to normal too quickly, I don’t want people to get sick that don’t have to.  But a incredibly selfish prt of me just wants this to be over, really really really badly.  I hate feeling like shit all the time, I hate starting and ending my days with panic attacks, I hate feeling trapped and like there’s nobody here to listen to me, I hate not being able to sleep, I hate not being able to get my work done, I hate all of this.  

I know this sounds very bitchy so I’m sorry about that.  I just need to get this out there because I have not yet been able to find a perspective on the internet similar to mine.  So apologies if I wasted your time with this, I just needed to get this off my chest.",14May2020,1
93,"Hi guys just telling you now that I’m just ranting because I cannot do it anywhere else honesty. I am an 18F who has had a lot of issues because of my parents problems and behaviors. I grew up in a very emotionally toxic household because of my parents. My father was (and still is) psychologically abusive, emotionally abusive, and physically abusive. He is one of the major players when It comes to my mental health problems in my life. He isolated me from others when I was a child. I was very lonely because I didn’t and couldn’t make any friends because to the kids of elementary because of my forced isolation because of my father. 

I didn’t learn about normal social norms until I was in middle school and had more liberal access to the internet. Middle school was worst. My dad didn’t just abuse me he was also abusive to my mom. I can never shake the day of July 22, 2015 out of my mind for this reason.

That night my dad beat my mother with a TV remote in the face . He didn’t do it in front of me or my brother. But we heard everything. I rushed out of my room and saw and horrible sight. My mom left eye was all bloody. I called the police but my dad stopped me. That night really f*cked with my head. I was 12. 

My mom survived the ordeal but very mentally damaged than before. She was extremely depressed. I remember having to drag her out of bed and seeing her hopelessness. I had to be my brother’s and my mom mental crux for the following two years. I had no one to talk to about my situation because my mom swore me to secrecy about everything that was going on. 
With all this going on at home school didn’t help at all. I was bullied by the girls for being weird in their eyes and not fitting into any of there clicks. I felt the world around me was falling apart and no one was coming to save me. I became depressed myself. I hid it better than my mom but it was far worst. I had suicidal thoughts to the point that I had ideas of how to go through with it. 
My mom was the biggest victim of my dad. Because of the violence he inflicted on to her she is permanently blind in her left eye. My dad did go to prison at the hospital where my mom was being treated. But he soon got out because of the vultures that were circling around us. My uncle and grandmother pressured my mother into signing the paperwork to get my dad out of prison. My mom at that moment she said she felt she had no other choice because of how broken she was mentally. 
I wish to this day he stayed. He never hurt me again directly again after July 22 but he learned to f*ck with us in different ways. 
When I found out that he was coming home I was horrified. I didn’t know what to do. But when he came home he acted like he was only on vacation (In my mind I was like WTF). I made my mom sleep in my room with my brother for fear that my dad was going to finish her off. I slept with sharp pair of scissors under my pillow ready to kill my father if he tried anything.
Needless to say It was horrible. I did start getting out of my depression by the end of 8th grade. I did that all on my own by without knowing it on self improvement. I chose to focus (and distracting) myself with my problems at home and at school with focusing on learning as much as I could about the world around me. I didn’t want to be naive anymore. I’m my mind I had to grow up to protect myself from getting hurt.

My dad was nice to my mom when he first came back home but in a year went sour. They started fighting nonstop and I had to step in to break it up. I had enough of this. I developed a silver spine and silver tongue because of what happened in my life to this point. And I started using it. I told my mom that she needs to divorce my dad or lose me and my brother for good because I was going to leave home. In retrospect it was cruel to say but it snapped her out of it. 
She finally started to make plans and act in them to get out of this toxic relationship. The divorce trial started when I was a freshman in high school.

The divorce became just as ugly as what was going on before. When I thought I was finally going to get out of this terrible situation but I had to deal with Family law. It was terrible. I had three people in the case who were responsible for my well-being a personal psychologist, a reunification therapist, and a guardian alightum. The therapists were the nicest people but the guardian however was the worst. She asked me about what happened and I told her my truth. She didn’t believe me. She made these statements about me and my future relationships that really....hurt and I hope won’t be true. 
She said that if I don’t persue a relationship with my dad or do things her way I will be doomed to having disfunctional  relationships. My parent got 50/50 custody of me and my brother. I hated this for reasons that would be obvious if you didn’t skip to this point. I didn’t want (and still don’t want to talk to) my dad because he was the root cause of my horrible life to that point. But I had to do it because I was a minor and my voice didn’t matter. Also he decided to be a parent after 17 f*cking years of him not giving a f*ck about being a good dad to me. 
At least now I am 18 and now and tell the judge and the court to f*ck off and but my dad at a distance that was healthy for me. Also I but my mom at a distance 
because I have been her emotional crux for my entire life and I want to learn to live again without needing an emotional crux

Overall, If you don’t want to read this entire post that’s fine. But I wanted to share this with all of you because no one should feel the way I felt throughout my life. Even though now I can physically separate myself for this it left me very emotionally damaged. I’m scared it will  stop me forever from having a healthy relationship with another person. I never had a boyfriend or even know where to start because of this. I believe that there is a way to have a healthy relationship I just don’t know how because I feel like I have so many emotional issues and I don’t know how to overcome them.

i just want to vent here and see if anyone else can relate to how i've been feeling lately. a bit of background first, i'm 17F from the UK and i'm diagnosed with depression, anxiety and BDD. when i wad 15 i was prescribed sertraline, didn't work for me at all but i was scared to speak up about it and ended up staying on it for almost 2 years, it took me attempting to overdose and having to sit in a hospital by myself all day for me to finally speak up and i've been switched to fluoxetine. 

here's the thing. the new medication i'm on is working so well, im not sure what to do with myself. i've never known a life where i can just get up and feel like a person (ish, still getting there). it's such a weird concept to me that now i'm like, well what now? yknow? especially with this pandemic. i just don't know what to do with myself lmao. i get pretty bad nighttime anxiety (i always have , that seems to be when my overthinking is at its worst) so it always seems to be at night where i feel like i NEED to be hustling and doing shit but i just CANT and i dont know WHAT to do like ??? i'm trying to look after mysrlf more with skincare and such but ive never known the feeling of wanting to do normal things and having that motivation and it just feels so weird. has anyone else experienced this when recovering?",14May2020,1

The title speaks for itself sadly, after a few bad years with cutting myself ( although it was very minor) but I got out of that habbit.
But recently I always found something like suicide a romantic end and I know it's fucked by I can't stop thinking about it.
I find it attractive when some is not mentally sound like being  a masochist.

I am sorry for this but I want to know what to do about it
I am very fucked up and I don't know how I got here, maybe it's the loneliness that is taking a toll on me.",14May2020,1
98,"Today I was on webtoon and read a message from an author about there life and it inspired me to write this so if you are struggling please hear me out.

Throughout my school life ive felt like a worthless nobody and in 6th grade I wanted to die, I couldn't take my mothers abuse and the bullying at school didnt make it any better, eventually my mom sent me to the hospital for a week, and after that my dad gained custody of me and my happiness skyrocketed because I would be with people who cared about me.

Months passed and I started my 7th grade year in a new state, I was excited to have a new start and on the first day my brother decided to piss me off by rough housing with me when I really didn't want to, he left a bruise and didnt seem to care but neither did I because pain wasnt a new concept to me so I thought it would be fine (I was wrong because now I have several spots on my body that hurt if I use those limbs too much so fuck you brother) and carried on with my day ignoring other students and just sitting back seeing their personalities and observing how they act just to be safer of who I trust.

A week passed and a girl talked to me (later she explained that she talked to me out of pity) and we became good friends but eventually I figured out that she was extremely deppresed and she taught me how to (trigger warning) cut myself to take away some pain that I felt...

Months later my arms have scars all over them and I dumped my friend because I couldnt deal with it anymore and my brother still hadn't stopped so eventually I wanted to die once more because I felt so worthless (god I just started crying remembering that) 

The next year I met a new friend group and they pulled me out of that dark endless circle I was in and nourished me and eventually became my light so I made a promise to never ever cut my wrist again just so I can protect my light.

Now everytime I think of doing that again I feel pain in my wrist and then I look at all the scars and remember my promise and smile.",14May2020,1
99,"So I’m not sure if this really counts as a mental health problem, but let’s go anyways.
So I have this problem where my mind turns normal, everyday actions into bad ones.
For example: I was stressed about something today and I went to go and eat some skittles that I had. But my mind instantly told me that I shouldn’t because I would be stress eating and stress eating is bad.
It’s not so bad that I didn’t eat the skittles (I really wanted some) but it’s still pretty annoying to have to deal with it.
It’s kind of hard to explain, but I just want to know: does this happen to anyone else? If so, maybe  I could get some more information as to why it’s happening and/or if it’s a completely normal thing to do.
Thanks!",14May2020,1
100,"I come from a fairly conservative religious Asian immigrant family and the older I got the more I didn't align with their toxic mentality. I realized my dad truly had a temper problem altercations with a random person over the pettiest of things are almost always expected on top of the constant road rage and violent tantrums he throws in the house that leads to things being broken or people getting hurt. My mom is overly controlling of every aspect of my life would blame me as a child for the arguments between my parents. My sister is constantly reinforcing this behavior instead of supporting me despite us agreeing that our parent's thinking is wrong and even throws me under the bus at times. It also doesn't help that I wouldn't consider myself a practicing catholic in a very catholic house that I must still participate in. 
To add to this you have the racist, homophobic, misogynistic thinking that plagues Filipino culture. 
My plan was to move out after college and hopefully get some space from my family but with Covid19 affecting the job market and society overall, those plans have been derailed. 
So my question is, how do you deal with a family that you don't align with at all and creates a toxic environment at home. It drains me every day knowing that I disagree with everything they say but I am too scared to communicate this with them.
I'm sorry if this comes off as whiny or childish but it's been something I've been struggling with. 
Thanks for reading",14May2020,1
101,"Emotions are a lot like cats. They are difficult to control and often speak to us in a cryptic language.

Through mindful practices (and tools such as [Thyself](https://www.thyself.me)) we come to realise that we are not our emotions. We have them and we can choose what to do with them but emotions do not define us. Think of emotions as the way our subconscious speaks to our conscious self. If an unpleasant motion arises, your subconscious is telling your conscious self something is not right. Rather than suppress the emotion we should investigate it further. 

Dr Tara Brach is a world-renowned meditation teacher and psychologist. She has popularised a simple technique for getting a handle on your emotions. The RAIN technique. Through regular practice you turn this way of thinking into a habit. When you feel uncomfortable, whizz through this technique. 

## R – Recognize
First, recognize you are experiencing an emotion. “What do I feel?” is a great question to start with. Label emotions when you feel overwhelmed. Through the mindful technique of labelling we learn what we are dealing with. Anger, hunger, sadness, worry, joy, happiness they can all be named. Labelling knocks whale-sized emotions down to size. Perhaps you are experiencing many emotions at one. Start by separating them and giving each a label. 

## A – Acknowledge, Accept, Allow
Secondly, be with the emotion. Sit with it. Let it fill you fully. Pause and give it time to say what it has to say to you. Accept its presence. Like an angry cat, it may feel extremely uncomfortable but just ride with it. Everything in your being may resist accepting uncomfortable emotions but step aside and let it pass.

To ease its passing, Brach suggests whispering an encouraging phrase.

“You might feel the grip of fear and whisper “yes” or experience the swelling of deep grief and whisper “yes.” You might use the words “this too” or “I consent.” At first you might feel you’re just “putting up” with unpleasant emotions or sensations. Or you might say “yes” to shame and hope that it will magically disappear. In reality, we have to consent again and again. Yet even the first gesture of allowing, simply whispering a phrase like “yes” or “I consent” begins to soften the harsh edges of your pain.“


## I – Inquire, Investigate
As children, curiosity comes naturally. So many of us lose our curious spirit as we age. The third step in RAIN, Investigate, needs us to channel our lost child. Get curious. With kindness, interrogate the emotion. Combine this with [Dr Tasha Eurich’s ‘What not Why’ questioning style](/blog/2020/05/07/ask-what-not-why-for-better-mental-health-tasha-eurich) to avoid rumination. “What made me feel like this?” “What is this emotion trying to tell me?” “What other times have I felt this way?” “What thoughts and sensations are connected to this emotion?” ""What is the signature of this emotion?"" Listen carefully to how the emotion responds.


## N – Non-identification / Nurture
Through this process we end up at non-identification. You are not your emotions. Through recognizing the emotion we established our subconscious was trying to tell us something. By accepting the emotion fully, we opened ourselves to understanding. Investigating the emotion we learned what it had to say. Non-identification falls naturally on from this. As the emotion passes we are still here, the emotion is not. You are not your emotion.

With mastery of RAIN, you’ll be able to step aside when a big hairy emotion comes your way and see it walk on by.

On cloudy days it must rain before we enjoy the sunshine.

102,"I was not sure how to phrase this in the title. One every week or two I will have a nightmare right when i fall asleep (as in i look at the clock and its been 10 or so minutes). I will feel like i am in the near sleep state when i wake up and will usually feel quite frightened, then I fall back asleep and imminently have another nightmare which wakes me up. I will again notice its been only a few minutes, I will feel like i am half asleep, and this repeats two or three or more times until I fall asleep for the rest of the night.

A bonus question I would love some insight into; I wake my wife up after my nightmares sometimes to help with the post nightmare terror feeling. For a few years now my nightmares tend to be followed by one or more (sometimes it feels like five or even more) false awakening dreams where i wake up from my nightmare, try to wake my wife, and either cant and then i ""wake up"" again, either for real or in another false awakening dream, or I may even have another nightmare within my fake ""waking up"" dream.

This happens especially often when I am having the repeated nightmare pattern described above. Limited googling did not find anything so I was wondering if anyone had any insight or a link to a study or page describing these phenomena.",14May2020,1

I can’t change my final grades after summer since I’m going to be done with the courses I’m taking.

104,"So to start with l believe in God and his existence and l fell in love with a girl. We aren't in a relationship nor friends. I am always stuck at home and anxiety was eating me. I thought hey lets ask God if this is all worth it and if she is going to be my future wife. I said ""God,if she is meant to me and l will marry her,she will appear in my dreams tonight and if shes not the one l will give up and move on. I dreamed her and l woke up at 5 a.m. and thanked God. I was so sure that l will marry her and that fell off. Every day l fight about it like is she really gonna be my wife,everyday.

I always ask this and l constantly think that everything is a Gods sign and l believe it. Every it is yes or no.

I know this all sounds stupid and weird but do you think its a sign by God and that l should believe it? Should l believe in the dream that l got and not some thoughts and insurences that occur while constantly sitting at home in the same room. Do these thoughts just lie? Help me",14May2020,1
105,"I feel like i am not being taken seriously in my family sometimes. My sister has a word to say for every little thing i do, even if i am doing it right. And when i get angry she just calls me weird and says im going through a hard time and that i should stop acting like an angsty teen. When i tell my mom about something that i like she just says ""uh huh yeah"" and when i ask if she is listening to me she always says ""of course"". Like thats literally the only conversation we have. I have been pulling my eyebrows for some time now and its obvious unless i cover it. I searched up if it was some kind of a disease and i found out about trichotillomania. Of course its not good self diagnosing, but its a very good chance that i have trichotillomania. When my family noticed it they got angry at me, but its not something i can stop. My dad once told me that if he sees my hend on my eyebrow he will slap may hand. I told them multiple times the only way this can end is for them to take me to a therapist, but they never said anything back, not listening to me.

I have problems with my dads side of the family too. They always bring me down for their own pleasure. I have told them my goals multiple times and they have always disagreed since my goals weren't in medical studies or architecture, since they want me to have a job in those field to boast to their friends about me.

106,"so this was my first session and i basically told him i overthink the past a lot, like ppl who hated me/ were mean to me in hs and y i was mistreated like that. 

he asked me how i coped with these ppl and i told him i just ranted to my friends but i never talked to adults or my parents about these problems. and then he told me it seems like i was pretty alone in this situation and that maybe the reason i still think about these things is bc i dont have a big support system. that made me rlly upset bc i already feel rlly alone all the time and like i cant trust anyone. and i dont rlly talk to my parents so im kind of just alone w my feelings all the time. 

he also told me he wants me to exercise more and try to look for jobs over the summer or take classes so im not thinking about this stuff. 

he also said that ppl will mistreat u even if u do nothing. and he also said they do it bc they no that there’s no negative outcome. which also rlly hurt me bc it’s true, like no one cares if my feelings were hurt by ppl saying mean things about me bc it’s not like i was popular or rlly relevant i just minded my own business and did my own thing and they new i wouldnt retaliate. but i did retaliate sometimes but what would that do? it would just give my bullies the reaction they wanted. 

he also told me i should try to think of the positive outcome of all of this stuff. and ig one good thing was i never stuck around the ppl who brought me misery and was able to make new and better friends. and the ppl that bullied me ended up losing all of their close friends by the time they graduated. it also prepared me for running into ppl like that in the future ig.

107,"I had to break up with my severely depressed girlfriend because she had been mentally and psychologically abusing me for far too long.

We have been through so much together. She helped support me getting my brother clean from drugs and alcohol and was there in the psychiatric ward when he tried to kill himself. I was there to support my girlfriend and she watched her older brother die of cancer. I have so much deep connection with this girl and she is suddenly out of my life.

I am really sad almost all the time and I have been smoking a crazy amount of weed to help deal with my depressive states.

109,"Hello, I’m F20 if that helps and I’ve been abused most of my life. Childhood was basically being bullied to the point where I was terrified to come to school, then I have to go stay in different foster homes after my mom passed away. They’re incredibly abusive, I move around a lot, every few months or so and I really never get the feeling of full “safety”. I miss my old home despite how bad it was. I miss the few friends I have. I end getting into an abusive relationship in high school where I was constantly cheated on and told I was worthless, etc. I moved out at 18, broke up with him, and moved to my hometown on my own (I have a roommate tho). 

That was incredibly summarized. My biggest issue since finally being “free” from all the chaos is the feeling of insecurity, mostly about other girls my age. I started dating one of my oldest friends, and we get along great. My insecurities are driving us apart however. He knows my past and he knows I have problems, but I don’t think he realizes how bad they are.

I truly believe that I’m going to end up getting cheated on or left for another prettier, smarter, funnier girl. I just know it, call it paranoia but it’s this disgusting feeling in my gut. I KNOW I have a mental illness, I’ve been diagnosed with different things many times in my life. I truly feel that my last relationship truly destroyed any self respect I have for myself. 

I can’t stand looking at other females. I can’t go outside and see one without having panic attacks and crying and shaking on the spot. I can’t shake the feeling that they’re so perfect, they got perfect lives, they have perfect families with stupid dogs and siblings who love them and a nice house. They had a life where they could attend high school with their best friends and take after school sports. I got none of that. I can’t look as pretty as they do. I can’t get friends, people think I’m a disgusting psychopath because I lost my mom and people spread rumors I killed her when I first left this town. Why do they look so perfect?! I spent thousands of dollars from working and working to buy new clothes and products to make myself look more approachable and nothing works. I get so paranoid and depressive that I often have started to get paranoid delusions that the girls on my YouTube feed are judging me and how they look so much better than me. How they can take my boyfriend away from me.

I had a mental breakdown three days ago. I started to start crying and shaking because I saw a really pretty blonde girl and I thought about suicide but I just felt numb, I started to bawl uncomfortably and talking nonsense, like I felt so convinced that I was so worthless I straight up called my boyfriend to break up with him and I screamed at him why he would cheat on me (he didn’t.) After a few hours I calmed down and I felt horrible and I felt guilty for accusing him for nothing. He told me to call my therapist, the next day I had an appointment anyway. I told her everything (this is my largest issue I’m trying to work through in therapy) but she doesn’t do jack shit.

I’m so terrified of the monster I’m becoming. I can’t even function when I see another female. ESPECIALLY good looking ones. What the fuck is wrong with me, i don’t know anymore. I’ll take pills, I’ll go through extensive programs, whatever, I just want these insecurities and fears to LEAVE.",14May2020,1
111,"I have never been someone who can come into casual relationships with any girl. Always felt like knowing someone before you fully commit yourself. But after my last relationship, where the girl I met was from Tinder had suffered a lot of things in her past and was going from severe depression and undergoing therapies and was addicted to smoking and drinking problems and had an STD which was transmitted to her by her previous ex boyfriend who ultimately cheated on her after assaulting her (nothing is made up, she herself opened up about this).
In trying to support her, in the time when all she did was self harm, smoke and drink, I lost myself. 
We couldn't date for long, it was hardly 13-14 days where she distanced herself and in the end found a new guy before we even broke up and she left. I was opened up to a different world of mental health. I have had anxiety issues, that's why I felt like wanting to support, to which I believe I failed. And in the meantime, I damaged my mental peace. After that, I couldn't get attached to anyone. I believe I don't have that emotional attachment with anyone. It been more than 1.5 years and I have met a lot of people, but I never have had the same feeling of wanting to be in a relationship with someone again. I despise the idea now. I think I can never get the closure from her. It will always be a part where I learnt so much but that cost my emotional self. There have been people who confessed they like me but all I could respond was, ""thank you"". 
And I am a good listener I know that, but at times I don't feel like telling this to anyone. And I don't feel like I can trust someone completely. That part of me where I used to get emotionally attached is dead.

114,"Any advice on how to help someone thorough a nervous breakdown? My gf hasn't worked in two months. She's been absolutely hysterical the last two weeks, sometimes cries for hours nonstop. Other times she's extremely happy and doesn't sleep, and doesn't stop talking. Her words don't make sense and she rambles on about things that don't make sense. 

She is a massage therapist and the idea of helping others is what drives her. Being locked down has affected her on a huge emotional level. I've been trying to help her get through this but don't know how. Trying to talk ""sense"" to her only makes her breakdown worse.

119,"was diagnosed twice with OCD in 2017 and know just how much it destroyed my life, after taking meds for a few years i have been remissive for quite sometime, i now got another assessment last week and was told i didn't have OCD.

I am feeling suicidal and dismissed, OCD is something that wreaked havoc on my life and suddenly it is no longer on my list of diagnosis, i feel this is an injustice as to what i was suffering with. I have again in the past 24 hours started thinking about suicide and experiencing suicidal ideation, i felt like i wanted to end it because it is not fair they took a diagnosis that was so close to home away from me. I know i personally have mental illness, but now they wanna say i don't have mental illness and instead i have ''Autism''.

i was diagnosed by a multi team of specialists last week with far more credentials than the people i saw a few years ago. I called my doctor 5 times today who has not yet gotten the report and i asked him if he could please keep Anxiety on the list and not remove it, he said it will depend on what the report says, i also called my psychologist 3 times pleading with them to the point it was almost harassment.

I know i have Autism, but i also have anxiety.  OCD destroyed me and my life and without medication i would've long ago died of suicide.

121,"I’ve never used reddit before, and I’m on mobile. (Does that matter?) but I’ve never said my story to anyone before so I thought I could put it here. It might be long, and none of this is a joke. To preface I haven’t talked to anyone else but the same 3 people in 6 years so my social skills are nonexistent which leads to me using offensive words, so if I say something like that (e.g. any swear words, derogatory terms, etc.) I’m sorry. So I guess this starts with how I was never really at school for all of my freshman year and the first half of my sophomore year because I was always in and out of the hospital (ER, inpatient, outpatient, residential, etc.) for a large number of suicide attempts and just being mentally unwell. (I had a female friend who committed suicide during this time also, this I think will be important later.) so by the end of the first semester of my sophomore year I had basically little to no credits but somehow I was still going up grades. I think some teachers just waved a lot of assignments including finals. Anyway, at the end of the first semester of my sophomore year I was fine(?) enough to be hospital free and to this day I haven’t been back to a hospital. But the school decided to send me to a special ed school, I think it’s called a credit recovery school or something I don’t know. But they decided that at a meeting I wasn’t even there for so I was pretty upset. Now like I said before I haven’t talked to anyone even at the hospitals, I stared at the wall the entire time and lied to get out quicker. But eventually the second semester started and I went, and holy shit it was god awful. Now there wasn’t any special ed kids like I thought it was going to be. It was the dumbest fucking people I’ve ever met in my life. I’m talking kids that are always high or drunk and kids that just didn’t care about school or learning. Now first, I like learning, LEARNING, but that’s not what was happening at that school. The classes taught shit I had learned in elementary/ middle school. So that gave me zero incentive to listen or pay attention. Second, was the fact that the majority of the kids there were minority’s. Now I don’t know if I’m racist, but the accent that they had, I don’t know what to call it but someone I know called it a “hood accent”, but that way that they talked honestly made me want to rip my ears off, like just pronounce the fucking words properly please. Sometimes I didn’t even know if they’re speaking English or not because of their accent and how fast some of them talked. Anyway, it was like a living hell for me. The one good thing was the teachers, they were honest people that just wanted to help these kids find their way after high school. Now all that happened for the second semester was me just going to each class and not saying a single thing. I don’t think anyone in the school had heard my voice the entire semester. Now during this time I didn’t realize it but I had developed narcolepsy. I don’t know if developed is the right word but whatever. And it was bad, I was slipping in and out of consciousness randomly and my sleep schedule was fucked and so was my body clock. Now it was getting to a point where I was losing the ability to discern reality from fantasy. So we went to some type of doctor to see what’s up and that’s when I was officially diagnosed with narcolepsy. Until that point I think I only had something along the lines of clinical depression and major anxiety disorder. So I had medicine that was supposed to help with those two (I still don’t think they do anything) and a new medicine for the narcolepsy that kept me awake through the day (this is seemingly the only medicine that does anything) now around this time I was about to start my junior year which I was obviously extremely upset about. But once it started it was the same as last year with me just going to each class listening to music sneakily (I have long hair so they couldn’t see the earbuds) and then leaving. But at some point I just started getting angrier and angrier and I assumed it was just the school so a little bit into the school year I started just showing up late, literally just missing up to the first 5 periods and it looked like nobody really cared so that’s how it was for the rest of the year until the school closed. I’m gonna pause here cause I forgot to mention the junior year is also my current year so when I say closed I mean due to the quarantine. Now also before I continue it’s worth mentioning that the anger thing didn’t stop, from the end of 2018 to now (may 14, 2020) I have just felt nothing but anger and hate to the point literally don’t feel anything else I’m not happy anymore I’m not even sad anymore I’m just incredibly angry at everything. Now another thing to note is I started to have auditory hallucinations of just a female voice calling out my name and saying stuff like “do it” or “c’mon” and other similar phrases around the start of the school year. Now this is where the female friend who killed herself might be important, and note she was an online friend the only thing I knew about her was she had naturally orange hair. At first hearing the female voice didn’t really effect (affect?) me cause my anger clouded all of my thinking. Now I don’t know how auditory hallucinations are supposed to work but I didn’t hear her voice in my head I heard it through my ears like there was someone whispering in my ear. Until one day I PHYSICALLY felt someone’s hand slide up my back and onto my shoulders, and hearing more whispers but this time it was just “hey” and giggling as well has seeing a hand on my shoulder in my peripheral vision (I was too scared or shocked to turn my head) but when I blinked and quickly spun around to see the corner of the room with no one behind me. Now at this point I wasn’t thinking it was something paranormal until recently (starting last month) I started seeing my reflections in my peripheral vision like walking past a mirror or black screen or glass and seeing a girl a little bit shorter than me with natural orange hair where my reflection should be. First it’s not something I can do on purpose I only see “her” when I glance and look away quickly or walk by and see it in my peripherals but when I realize I saw “her” and look back it’s just me. Second she’s not naked or wearing different clothes she’s wearing whatever I am at the time of the reflection. Third I said I have long hair but hers is a lot longer than mine plus like I said hers is naturally orange and mine is naturally black plus there is somewhat of a size difference. Now am I honestly going crazy from being so lonely or is this some fucking ghost shit or what I honestly don’t know am I becoming a schizo or something I’m more scared of the cost of treatment than a ghost (lol) regardless I know this story was everywhere so if you read this and have questions about something I made unclear then let me know.

122,"i don't know what has gotten into me as of recently but I almost feel as if no matter what I do I can't help but feel bored. I've been playing an unhealthy amount of video games as of recently, which is something that typically will keep me distracted for hours upon hours on end but I just can't help but feel bored of it. I feel like there isn't really a goal for me in life and I just don't know what will make me happy anymore. In the past I had dealt with a lot of things like depression and such but I don't even feel sad anymore, its almost as if I've passed the being sad part. Nothing makes me feel happiness and I feel like everyday is full of me just going through the motions. Now I know that the first thing that you might think of is oh it's quarantine I'm sure that's gotta have a role in this, but this has been a thought on my mind for a while now and I don't necessarily have anyone to talk to about it anymore. So here I am, venting to the wide internet and trying to at least get some help, if you have any ideas of something that might help or advice I'm more than willing to listen because I'm just tired of always feeling like this, regardless of the situation.",14May2020,1

I can't let go and forgive myself no matter how hard I try. Advice falls flat for me. I think it's mostly because I tell myself that the advisor(s) doesn't know what I keep secret. I feel undeserving of love. I feel I have more than I deserve already. Selfsabotage is what I do best and the fucked up part is.... I almost feel good about it afterwards. Like I've made the right choice because I'm now suffering.

130,"Not to be confusing with the title, but I think I might be a manipulative person and I don't know how to stop it if I am.

I moved long distance to be with my boyfriend and put myself in a bit of debt in the process. He got a great job in this new city, and so I started looking for a job and managed to work for a couple months before coronavirus hit and I got let go from my new job.

I'm having a really hard time, and as a result of that, I have been causing my boyfriend and I to fight all the time. My emotions are all over the place (anxiety, general stress, feeling depressed) and this is really starting to make everything bad.

I want to be an okay person, but everything I do kind of points in the opposite direction.

When I picture the person I want to be I imagine someone ambitious, fun, likable, intelligent, good-looking, responsible and caring. Right now I feel like I am none of those things. 

All my life, I've felt like I need to prove (maybe not to anyone other than myself) that I am capable and independent and fun-loving, but everything I do has illustrated clearly for me that I am exactly the opposite. I know that because of coronavirus that a lot of people aren't working, but I was already hardly working before that. I haven't held a steady full-time job since September last year, and that was actually through a temp agency, so if I'm being brutally honest with myself, I haven't held a full-time job with an actual employer that provided me some semblance of financial security since September of 2018. Yikes.

As for being independent in a non-financial sense, I am completely failing at that too. I am entirely codependent in my relationship, and to be frank, I think that I am a seriously shitty girlfriend. Despite my boyfriend currently paying for everything for me, I feel generally unhappy and I think that makes me a super selfish person. I guess I am just really ungrateful.

I used to be fun-loving when my boyfriend and I first started dating, but slowly I've turned into someone I don't even recognize. I don't feel like doing any of the things I used to do for fun, and I gave up the few friendships that I had in order to move here to be with my boyfriend. I know I could've stayed in touch over the phone and through social media, but I have no close friends nearby me anymore and the few new friends I've made I don't know well enough to burden them with my emotions.

I feel like I'm trapped, maybe even like I'm suffocating. Am I just an overall shitty person? 

As for the other aspects of our relationship: we're barely having sex anymore, being in self-isolation has really dampened whatever motivation either of us had to be active and he's hinted several times that he thinks I'm ""up to something"" on my phone because he happened to look at my screen when I clicked into a different page or app, and his reaction was to assume that I was hiding something. This is especially the case when I put my phone down whenever he comes in to the bedroom or comes by me to talk to me because I don't want to be distracted by it while we're talking to one another.

He's started scolding me for being on my phone, even though the times I am using it are when we aren't talking to one another, but in the morning when I wake up he is usually just scrolling through social media until he needs to start working. I brought up that I felt like he was scolding me, and he claimed that he wasn't so maybe I am just crazy. 

Honestly, I feel like I am so crazy. I mean, I have a good boyfriend who is paying for me to live rent-free right now because I'm unemployed and somehow I'm still unhappy? I completely understand why he is so frustrated with me all the time. He does a lot of nice things for me, and since I am not earning anything, I try to do nice things like cook dinner every night and tidy up the house and be available whenever he wants to take a break from his work to socialize with me.

I've started gaining weight, I'm broke, I can't sleep anymore and all I do is cause my boyfriend and I to fight all the time. I frustrate him by getting upset or sad, and then I feel terrible because I've frustrated him or made him angry and I keep on apologizing for making us argue and promising to be a better person, but I don't know how. 

I let my emotions overrun me sometimes, and this causes my boyfriend to feel bad. I can't help but cry when we argue, and then he'll tell me that I'm turning everything around to be his fault. I'm worried that I'm emotionally manipulating him by being so emotional and letting myself feel sad.

How can I be a better person/girlfriend? I'm trying to find a job, stay somewhat active during isolation and not let my negativity show through right now because I don't want to fight and I don't want to keep crying, and I definitely don't want to be manipulative.",14May2020,1

so my partner and I are in our early 20's and have been together since high school and he's always been anxious, but for the past couple yesrs he's been battling OCD. it's been very severe in the past and at the moment while it's not as bad as it has been, we live together and I'm struggling to be around him because of it. he is constantly stressed about his cat making sure everything is okay with him and while I am sympathetic to him and I know he can't control it, I battle my own mental illnesses and I am struggling to handle it. he projects it on to me in a way that causes me to be that stressed that I break out in rashes, I can't sleep, and I'm now back on anti depressants because I can't cope. I love him but I hate his OCD. What's worse is that he refuses to get help because of how lacklustre mental health services are where we live. But without him getting help, it just gets worse and I can't handle it.

I’ve been feeling tired everyday and it gets annoying because it’s like a continuous cycle. Today I just feel so useless because I found out I’m failing a second class. Every day I study until I go to sleep, I literally don’t make time for anything else except my study. I began stressing a lot and not only has that affected me mentally but physically too.

I have already had thoughts of myself probably being narcissistic because I’m always thinking mostly about myself and what I want to do and what I get as a benefit. This happened usually when I was with friends and I don’t want them to poke fun of me but when they do I laugh a little and try to think up of something about them. I hate when they say they will tell a secret of mine to someone else but I’ve done it before to others. How much of a hypocrite am I?

138,"I have to stay at home almost all the time
My family members only talk to me when they need my help and this INFURIATES me. It's the way they talk - they show no regard for my energy levels and just ask what they want on impulse. If I don't even have the energy to speak much for the past 2 months, they should know better than to ask me for help on little things. 

Had an anxiety attack just now because of increased noise levels at home. There are many ppl at home and I can hear the TV and chatter even when in my room. 

I live in Singapore so it's 19 more days of lockdown (govt calls it circuit breaker)

They are aware of my MAD, but they just don't know how to support ppl with mental illnesses. I used to tell them my problems. They would worry for a while and when I seem to be ""back to normal"", they forget all about it and return back to their insensitivity. 

I don't know how to tell my parents without sounding rude that they seem to have no common sense to look at how miserable I look before asking me for help. I also don't feel like telling them because I feel like my issues are trivialised when they forget about them and return to their insensitivity.

I gained 10kg in less than 6 months, then a further 10kg in the year following (I'm now medicated for my thyroid and no longer gaining weight).

After gaining this weight the body discomfort has become increasingly frequent. If I can feel a wave coming on the best thing I can do is sit perfectly still until the feeling is mostly passed, just to stop it escalating. 

I was wondering if anyone has felt similarly or had ever heard of anything like this. I've talked to my psych about it but she doesn't seem to understand and seems to think I'm just upset about my weight. I'm also studying psych and haven't read about anything even remotely similar.

I'm passionate about programming, I have a few creative ideas I would love to turn into games, I'd love to code and illustrate for those games and everything but I just feel like that's never going to happen.

143,"This is my 4th year teaching. I am a high school, and I feel miserable at my job. I am relieved to be doing distance learning and feel really anxious about going back to school as normal in the fall. Not because of Corona, but because of the kids -I don't want to see them.  I know work doesn't ""cause"" depression, but can being in the wrong place make it worse? 

I am trying to fix me. I have a counselor, I recently asked for antidepressants which seem to be helping some, and overall life seems a little better, but then I lock up and am immediately filled with resentment for work. 

My first year teaching a counselor commits suicide, and I have to fight to earn my spot at the table with colleagues being the new teacher and being special education, which you get treated extra shitty. But chin up I endured telling myself next year will be better. 

2nd year the kids were so bad we lost a ton of good teachers, the drugs were out of control. I watched my sponsor studnet get into a major confrontation with security, ends up being maced in the face all the while I'm trying to keep the rest of my class safe. But next year will be bebetter, right? 

3rd year, I moved from special education to general education the kids didn't even seem like they were making any attempts of hiding drugs and were mixing lean in the middle of class out in the open, shameless vaping in class, gangs and drugs were really bad. One of my kids commits suicide. My former sponsor studnet and a few other students from my school gang up and KILL another student (off campus). Our admin was aweful and we lost over 1/3 of our total staff. Gaslighting was out of control.

 4th year, much better and different admin, drugs are still a problem but better. 2 student suicides. A rumor of some group planning to shoot up the school followed by a lock down where we all thought there was live gun shots on campus during (turns out it was domestic violence across the street, but it sounded like it was on campus) kids SCREAMING ""THERE'S A GUN THERE'S A GUN"". It wasn't until an hour later we found out it was not a school shooting, but for that hour, it was real. 

This is all in addition to normal frustrations that come with the occupation like working 60 hours a week but only getting paid for 32, studnet cell phones and apathy. Shitty parent involvement and too much paperwork. And overall demoralization and secondary trauma. 

I tend to look to my older colleagues as a temperature gauge. If their not worried, I'll relax. In this case the fee that Intend to look to all see to be ok. This stuff bothers them, but they seem to rebound pretty quick. Looking a little deeper after the years I've noticed they have stopped lesson planning years ago and just got from the book. Nothing interactive, but no 60 hours of work a week. They also are not reflective in their practice and just don't care anymore. Maybe I care too much? OR they are A TEACHER! and they have no social life outside of teaching and every ounce of them is dedicated to work and the profession. 

I feel really depressed. At this point I've worked so hard and have always asked for help when I needed it. I have had no shame in asking or receivung help from others. With professional educational mentors and my counselor I have changed everything I can control on the outside and I still feel aweful on the inside. I'm left with everything I can't control at this point and it feels too much. I have days where I call in sick just to stay home. I've also worked REALLY HARD to get to where I am. On the outside, everything is a success, but instead I'm ready to collapse. I don't want to throw away everything I've built here at this school. There are lots of good, but it feels outweighed.

I had some thoughts about him being old and such, but the thing is that the urge to cry came before these toughts: feeling so sad about some music box made me think about why that was happening, and these thoughts were only the ""logical"" conclusion i could reach. Another tought that came almost simultaneously was that of my grandpa reminiscing about the past, but i also don't really see that as ""sad"".

145,"Let me start off by saying I am not new to therapy. I have been in therapy in the past but was ghosted by one of my counselors a few years ago and I got lazy. So when COVID hit, I thought, never a better time to spend some time working on myself and find therapy again.


I signed up for BetterHelp through the app. First off they allow you a 7 day trial (I think this was offered after I ignored their first messages and prompts when I signed up). I paid $15 for the trial and it was to charge my card $265 a month after that. 


I thought why not, I will give it a try. It’s expensive but might be worth it.


First impression was, I don’t think 7 days is enough to work with a counselor and make a commitment to pay over $200 a month. Also, apparently this included unlimited access to your counselor. However, I personally don’t find the chat option valuable to me(I prefer to meet once a week and usually don’t need to chat between then) so I felt like I was paying a premium for this service when I only needed live sessions.


I had scheduled one session, and spoke with my counselor for the first time. I was happy with the intro and first meeting, but the second meeting is where it went wrong.

I had scheduled a time with my counselor, but needed to change it. There is no option to “change” the session date and time so I had to cancel it. I thought okay, I’ll cancel it and rebook, and if I HAVE to, I can rebook the same time slot.


I hit cancel and suddenly my time slot is gone along with all time slots 4 days out. I find it hard to believe these time slots are all taken so maybe the counselor took time off. I get it, it’s a job, not a life. However, when I messaged my counselor inquiring about there not being time slots open and questioning it, I was ignored.


I wanted to be able to book a second session before the seven days trial was up so I could make a decision about moving forward with monthly. However my counselor became unresponsive and I felt like I had no choice but to cancel before they billed my first month for $265.


It also makes me wonder that if I were distressed and needed to chat with my counselor, I don’t have faith that they would be there for me, and this is one of the features that the app highlights. The person couldn’t even respond to a simple question about rebooking my session. I messaged this person 3 times and gave them plenty of time to respond.


I have read mixed reviews about the service all over the Internet and on Reddit and I would personally say I do not recommend it. I’m going to search for therapy outside of phone apps.",14May2020,4

150,"I live in a suburb/coastal area and for some reason I’m always miserably, life destroying depressed whenever I’m here or in any other suburb area, but when I stay in the city (literally any city doesn’t have to be the closest one) this feeling goes away. I’m not depressed, I feel complete relief, I sleep better, I breathe better, I start feeling more motivated, i feel like I can relax and then I have to go back to the suburbs again and I fall into massive depression spirals where I can’t sleep until 8am, I have weekly mental break downs, nothing gets done and I feel so stressed.

I don’t understand what causes this, I have friends and family both in the suburbs and city, I eat the same types of food, live mostly the same lifestyle but when I’m in the city I don’t feel depressed and my sleeping improves (fall asleep around 10pm) and then I get stuff done. 

I can’t solve this because I can’t afford to live in the city but Idk why the fuck this keeps happening and it has been happening since I was 7 years old. I lived in the city as a child and my family would go to the coast to visit other family members and I would cry every night we were there and then we would go back to the city and it would go away again, then we moved here when I was 12 (it’s been a long time since then) and it’s basically just been a shitshow since. No one gets it because the coast where I live is a massive tourist destination for people and I feel really guilty getting depressed here because it is nice and I know I’m lucky to live here and so many people want to but I can’t help it.

What’s wrong with me, is this just me or does anyone else relate? How can I fix myself?",14May2020,1

Does anyone feel guilty for wanting to die/ committed suicide because other people go through a lot worse and they still fight and keep their heads up while you just want it all to end. Sometimes it feels as if I’m a coward, probably a shame as well for being this weak",14May2020,1
152,"Hi everyone.. any advice or people who can relate would be very helpful..

So.. I was in therapy briefly and didn't get anything out of it. I wasn't facing the same issues then. I was hospitalized in January due to obsessive intrusive thoughts that scared me. They started me on Zoloft there, and I'm currently taking 125 mgs of that. It has really helped so far with OCD. But the last couple days I've had a really bad spike in anxiety and depression.

It's hard to explain what's going on in my head but I'll try. I'm 19, and I've lived the last 5 years pretty much in isolation, in a tiny cottage with just my parents. Ever since we moved here 5 years ago, I've dropped out of high school due to the intense mental health issues. I have no friends, no job, no education, no license. Having autism, OCD and severe social anxiety makes getting out there and doing these things feel impossible. I don't know how to talk to people and I have no clue what I want to do with my life, I feel like my options are incredibly limited because of my challenges, which is the main source of my depression.

To compensate for having no life, I daydream and fantasize constantly. I imagine I'm a thin, funny, attractive, outgoing person and that I'm living my dream job with a group of friends. Due to my autism and OCD, I've always had an obsessive personality and I develop intense special interests in certain people/things. There are 2 (somewhat) famous people who I'm currently obsessed with. Normally daydreaming is my coping mechanism, it gives me an escape. But my feelings surrounding these 2 people have become so intense, they're all I think about. Normally this makes me happy, but the other day I had the realization that I obviously will never know these people, and that my daydreams and fantasy world will never live up to the sad, lonely life I'm living now. This made me anxious and sent me into a panic and horrible depression.

 I started thinking.. What is the point of living if I can't do anything in my daydreams? I can't possibly do any of these things for real, I'll never know or be friends with these people. How will my pathetic real life ever compete with that? What if I'll be miserable for ever? Now I feel such an intense need to meet these 2 people, like my life depends on it. I know how insane and creepy and pathetic that sounds, but I'm not some weirdo stalker and would never violate boundaries like that. And now I feel anxious seeing any content of them, because it brings on all these negative feelings. That's what's bothering me more than anything. I desperately want to go back to thinking of them as a happy escape.

I've spent so long living in my head and escaping reality by living in my fantasy world, it's always been a great coping mechanism and made me feel happy. But now I fear I've been living in my head so long that I don't know how to get out.. and in real life I'm lost, scared, and feel trapped and inadequate. My parents always tells me that I just have to try and go out and do these things, but I feel it's impossible due to my circumstances and that I'm ""destined"" to live this sad, pathetic life I'm living now, forever.

Sorry this is so long, thank you if you read it.. could really use some friends to talk to.",14May2020,2
153,"This may not be brief or clear, but I need to get everything out of my head. And if you’re offended by mildly graphic language, skip to the TL;DR at the bottom because TMI may as well be my initials. 

I wish I had been given a road map at birth. I’ve struggled my whole life with my sense of identity. It’s not made any easier by the fact that I have MI which causes issues with memory, so it’s like piecing together a puzzle, upside down, without the picture on the box. 

I’ve always felt socially alienated - not really fitting in with “the guys” or “the gals,” not relating to them on the friendship level as it pertains to sexuality and gender identity, and certainly not connecting on an intimate level. 

My first IRL crush was a girl in elementary school, S, and my first celebrity crush was Leonardo DiCaprio. I remember the whole bus laughing when I got a Leo photo book. (Remember book orders?) I also remember my father (whole n’other story) yelling at me for missing the toilet one day and saying, with a sexist disdain in his tone, he’d make me sit “like a girl. Those messages stuck with me - hide my true self or be ridiculed and shamed. 

A couple of my friends in high school were openly bisexual and I guess I adopted that label out of solidarity, though I was never openly attracted to anyone except S who was once again a peer, but I was aloof. (We moved a lot!) When my mother discovered this, she said, “Sodomy is disgusting,” and drove me to church on a weekday. Another girl, R, and I started “dating,” which only consisted of hand-holding and one kiss, which only happened because my friends staged an intervention and said I needed to kiss her. I broke up with her gracelessly. Sorry, R, but that’s where our story ends. Also, sorry for staring, S.

I first had consensual sex at 19 with my second girlfriend, M, an on/off LDR; we’d met in high school. It was during the time I was, thanks to family problems I had nothing do with, living out of my car and cheap motels while trying to afford school. I “failed” to perform because of nerves and she dumped me the next day via text. *That* felt awesome. /s

In college, I took a human sexuality class because I felt like I was lacking in what most people develop socially. We had guest speakers one day and the first trans woman I’d ever met spoke about having been molested as a child. I suddenly started crying because she had uncovered my own memories of being abused by an older friend, W. When I eventually told my mother, she quoted statistics to me when what I needed was a hug. 

Next, and this is my first time admitting it, I procured an escort but didn’t even finish. The goodbye was one of the most awkward moments of my life. 

Later that year, my friend decided I was gay and set me up with a guy friend of hers, T.. We had a bit of fun for a couple weeks, even though my roommate hated the fact that I had a guy over. One night, while my friends slept on the floor next to us after a night of drinking, T forced his dick into my mouth. I didn’t confront him then but I broke up with him shortly thereafter, under the guise of being overwhelmed when a mutual friend of ours fell into a coma after a car accident. (She’s okay now.) Later, when I told my mother, her first question was, “How drunk were you?” I’m getting that engraved on her Mother-of-the-Year award. /s

Just before my first semester in a 4-year college, when “It Gets Better” gained momentum, I decided I was asexual and plugged myself into the Ace community. I received a message on AVEN from a girl, Alexandra (my favorite name), who lived not too far from me. Turned out her name wasn’t Alexandra but M2 and we talked nonstop for weeks. I finally got up the courage to ask her out. It was an awkward Denny’s date that ended in a short walk and a brief kiss. Slowly but also suddenly, sex began to consume our relationship, but she was real weird about it. If you’ve ever dated a pastor’s kid, you probably know what I mean, but there was something else. Her ex, J, who was already 30 when we were 21, started infiltrating our relationship. It turned out he didn’t know about me or that M2 and I had been together a year. A rocky year, but, still. One night while staying in her dorm, I dreamt that J had sent M2 a letter proclaiming his love for her and renouncing his own asexuality (keep in mind, M2 and I were ‘“asexuals” who fucked like bunnies). I told her about it, trying to laugh it off, but she looked back at me sternly and said words I’ll never forget: “Have you been reading my mail?” 

Other strange things happened, like I was randomly paired with him on a game of Words With Friends, and the divide between us grew. I spent her last semester helping her find a great job that, AFAIK, she still has. I was finishing my last semester and she spoke very critically of one of my projects. Apparently, I’m stupid enough to stay with someone who was clearly cheating on me, up until the point that they doubt my career choice. (Insert facepalm.gif) I graduated with a higher GPA than she did, with honors. That *did* feel awesome. 

I spent the next few years in total isolation. My health declined and I couldn’t work but the state wouldn’t approve me for disability. At one point, my mother whom I live with, was watching Law and Order or something and a character went into graphic detail about being anally raped. I don’t know what put in her head that it was a good idea to ask me, “Was that what it was like when you were raped?” I got up without a word, went into my room and shut the door. For a full year, I couldn’t bring myself to leave the house, much less drive. Until... one my favorite defunct bands announced a reunion tour. I scrounged up the money and the courage to drive 45 minutes to the show. I ended up leaving 4 songs into their set due to an anxiety spike. Fortunately, they added a show the next year and I made up for it by staying the whole time, right at the front of the stage.

That’s when everything changed. I joined the fan page for the band on Facebook and found myself in a swirling cesspool of degenerates who thrive on mutual support and altruism. It was the strangest thing ever, but it made me reevaluate (for the thousandth time) who I wanted to be. 

Still fancying myself an asexual, I started a group on FB and, through that, met this beautiful girl, M3. Similar story - talk a bunch, plan to meet, blah blah blah. But I was still in the throes of a long depression (during which I did some of my strangest work) and cancelled our plan to meet. After another year or so, I reached out to her and it was like falling in love on fast-forward. We talked marriage, house, kids, everything. At her request, I put all of that in writing for when we could be together and made a plan to visit for a few days. Well, M3 is from the great white north, and the border patrol apparently doesn’t take kindly to foreigners promising to marry a citizen. Also, they read your shit and razz you about it for 20 minutes before putting a cap on your stay. So, *that* felt awesome. /s

Anyway, we met up and it was the most uncomfortable I had been in a while. After a day, she basically said she wasn’t feeling it, so I drove home and cried the whole way. The TimBits did help a bit. 

When I got home, I drank. I *really* drank. And ended up the most suicidal I had been up until that point. I spent 2 days in a PHP, which is the same as inpatient programs except you go home at 2pm.

During that stay, in a session of free-writing, I put down on a piece of paper that I still have: “I’m starting to think that my asexuality is just a cover for the emotional issues I’ve suffered.” 

Through continued therapy, I faced the demons I’d been ignoring. Namely, sitting down while peeing and wanting to make out with both of the main characters in Titanic. (Kate Winslet was the first nude woman I ever saw.) I came to the conclusion, after MANY long nights of reading, documentaries, soul searching, and reaching out to those in the community, that I am pansexual and genderfluid. Two labels which come with their own social difficulties, but I’m not in elementary school anymore - even if too many “adults” still seem to be. 

So, since my social life is generally contained to the internet, I joined a pansexual FB group, and through that, met the person who would become my ex-wife, B. Long story short (Too late?), they misrepresented themself and posed a legitimate threat to the safety of me and my family. We’d only been married two weeks before she stayed 6 weeks in in-patient psychiatric care. The divorce took 9 months. Fortunately, I was able to handle it all on my own, without fees. It was finalized in March of this year, just before lockdown started and I was furloughed by the first job I’d worked in 10 years. (Btw, they just cut off our health insurance.)

Since I’ve had nothing but time on my hands (and the *wonderful* flashbacks to the worst period of my life in isolation) I’ve had time to re-evaluate myself (for the millionth time). And I think I may be more trans than previously thought. I’ve dug up the memories (Remember, I have Swiss-cheese brain...) of me, sitting on the floor, naked, digging my fingers into my pelvis to see if I can feel a vagina underneath what barely qualifies as a penis and being hopeful that I would. I remember dressing in my mother’s and sister’s clothes as a child. I remember showing up to work on Halloween as transgender comedian Eddie Izzard. 

As of today, S is married, W is a complete loser (Awesome!), M is married, M2 is married to J, M3 is my platonic best friend (still gorgeous), B changed their name back, and I’m stuck stewing in what few memories I can muster and still trying to figure my shit out. Leo isn’t attractive to me now, but I’ve still got my eye on Kate, as well as Michael Pitt. (Hedwig was an important movie to me in high and I realized why while typing this sentence!) The band fan page split into factions and more-or-less disintegrated, but I’ve seen them live 6 times now, in cities all over the eastern half of the states, and got to ** fucking perform with them in Cleveland.**

I’ve invested some money in sex toys and makeup, for experimentation, and much of my time in learning more about myself and the world around me. Navigating the realms between emotional truths and surgical costs/complications is one of the most intense challenges I’ve yet faced.  Sometimes it’s nice to just get high (it’s legal) and watch Doctor Who. 

Funny story, I’m still the admin for the Ace FB group despite being comfortably pansexual and B, my “pansexual” ex-wife, tried to join, not knowing I founded it. I won’t say that that was of another of B’s misrepresentations because I’ve been in their shoes (and pants), but part of me does suspect. 

Anyway, I think that about wraps it all up. 
If you read all this and think I’m a spiteful, jealous, hapless, petty runt - you’re probably right. I regret many of the choices I’ve made and failed to make. I never aimed to hurt anyone despite a constant bombardment of abuse, neglect, and chastisement from others that, in all reasonability, should have become my new normal. Ultimately, I just want to understand what the hell this life I’ve been assigned to actually is, and how to find pockets of joy amid the misery. 

Thanks for letting me waste your time. 

TL;DR - I was given a late, unstable start, damaged by a lot of people, and have been contemplating the shifting levels of my own trans-ness and sexuality for too long to see it clearly.

I have done bad things while we have been together that I regret and she has told me to move on. She has horrible self esteem issues and me talking to other people while we have been dating has made her feel horrible of course. I am on a road trying to improve myself and I have talked about this with my therapist. This post is not about me though I need advice for my girlfriend. She does not like talking about any of this. She suffers from sexual trauma and from self hatred and has no motivation to do anything she mainly sleeps most of the day and stays up all night even when she tries to sleep at night she says she can not. She has promised me to not do it and she has never given me a reason not to trust her but she told me she will not do it because she can not she does not have the means to her plan was via gun to the head and I asked if she would if she had the means and she does not know and I am just very scared for her I do not want her to be hurting or to hurt now I really want her to be happy and be okay but she is set on her never being happy and I have had her be happy she laughs and has fun and stuff she is just in a split custody situation and both sides argue and do not help but ever since her mom quit drinking she has enjoyed being at her moms more now than when her mom drank and she enjoyed being with her dad more. I went to her moms house and talked with my girlfriend and her mom and her mom does not think a ward would help because her mom thinks for her to get better she needs to open up and talk about things. My girlfriend does not talk to her mom about this stuff but she tells me. She does not feel comfortable discussing a lot of it she has been molested multiple times and she does not talk about it. She is suffering in her own skin and she told me she does not want to feel like this anymore. I have given her dates and stuff after her planned suicide date to have things to look forward to such as parties and she was wanting to have a tea party with my friends and I. This quarantine is really hurting her as well with not much human interaction and such. Her dad beat her mom when she was younger and they are divorced now but her dad still does and says things that make her feel scared and afraid of him. I have done almost all I can do I am still with her and talking to her and always have told her I will be there for her. She wants to kill herself because of the things that have caused her trauma and her fear of the future with us being just graduating high school seniors. She does not know what she wants to do and I just do not really know what to do anymore. I have cried and cried to her and begged for her not to do it and I hate that she has the want and thoughts of doing it. I started a new job recently and I hate it 6 days a week 10 hours a day. My parents will not let me quit or ask to not work a day because I am already taking days off for graduation activities and I just do not think I am mentally steady or ready for this job and during these times with her I need to be there for her. Some people think she is playing me and not serious but I think she is she has felt like this for years and has had this date planned for a while. She is also very honest with me and has never given me a reason to not trust her. I have been super worried and she thinks I only care now because it is close to the date but I have always cared I just worry more because it is closer to the date she thinks no one cares about her because she has told people about this stuff and no one has taken her serious and her dad does not even think her issues are real. No one has done much of anything to help her and there is only such much I can do being that I can not drive and I am only 18 her mom is calling one of her ex therapist to talk to her through the phone today and I hope that can help some I just do not know what I can do please someone help.

156,"Hello, I want to tell you guys about my life and my problem(s). Sorry in advance, for my English skills.

First of all, some information about me. I'm 18 year old male, introverted and a high school student. I also wanted to make this post for quite some time.

I can't really describe my problem(s) or define them.  I lack a lot of self esteem, kind of hate myself and always blame myself for almost anything. I think first sign that something was wrong showed itself when was like in 7 or 8th grade ( maybe 4-5 years ago). Back then I got some sort of idea or something that I'm  a loser, that my life was meant to be  horrible and I won't achieve anything. After some time, this view disappeared. But more or less I always hated myself, the thought stayed at the back of my head. 

The problem reappeared again maybe 1 or 2 years ago ( hasn't disappeared yet). But it kinda grew, can't find the moment in my life when it started. And now this problem took a different shape, if you could say some, maybe because I matured. I no longer believed that my life is planned ahead and I can't change it. Now my point of view is this: I'm too pathetic, too miserable to change my life. I'm sort of waste of material, waste of potential I was given. The two main things how I describe or use to describe my life and myself is: **pathetic** and **smart enough to understand it, but too weak to change it**. It's kinda hard to describe it ( I'm writing this not in the heat of moment, when these kind of thoughts comes to visit) so I better give an example from my life. I fought with myself all day, because I wasn't able to say to my mother that I wanted to become a blood donor. Eventually I did it say it to her, but to this day I'm still not a blood donor. Also, I should say that, that day was my 18th birthday and so I was able to become what I wanted. But this moment shows how ,,broken'' I'm. I wasn't able to talk with my mother about my dream. To me that's just pathetic.( also, I should clarify that my relationship with both of my parents are great, I wasn't scared of my mother or something like that). And there are plenty of moments in my life, when I just can't do something because of myself. I haven't talked with my parents about my problem because of  another reoccurring problem. Probably because of my lack of self-esteem I'm not able to take a first step. That's also showed in the situation with my mother, which I talked about before. 

Combining these and probably different problems gives to me my life. I'm to scared to do anything, to get out of my comfort zone. And thus I'm hatting myself because I'm wasting my life doing nothing. ( I'm addicted to internet and other things, but nothing illegal). I'm to scare to leave my little ,,bubble'' and because of it it gets smaller everyday. How I think is that I was born in a good family, I had and still have everything I would want. But still I'm unable to use this ,, potential'' to achieve something great. My every attempt to achieve my dreams shatters because of me. And so I hate myself even more.

What I have tried to do, and I'm doing is writing a diary ( started doing it at January this year, or to be exact at my birthday). I don't know why I write it, maybe I just need to talk with somebody, but still I'm not talking with my parents. Just walking with a mask and pretending that I'm alright. And that proofs that my life is pathetic. I sort of understand my problems and how I can fix that, but once again smart enough to understand it, but too weak to change it. I'm mentally very weak a bad word from a closest person, one of the parents, and I have a mental breakdown.

So that's about it, if you have any questions I will gladly answer them. I know I didn't describe my problem any good, but I'm writing this after the mental breakdown, when I got better. These sort of thoughts comes when I get hit with reality of my situation. Forgot to mention, but I also dream a lot about how my perfect life would look like. I don't know if that changes anything. To be honest I don't really know why I wrote it, because I know my problem and I know the answer. And I don't know what to expect from this post, is just pathetic that I ask help from Reddit and not from my family members.",14May2020,1
157,"I'll make my story short.
I was becoming a police officer until I dropped out because I failed my exams. I did definetly study enough, because I made test exams and they were all great. Had a blackout and dropped out after it. Same time my ex leaves me because I wanted her to support me due to my loss of my job. She says I am robbing her freedom and leaves me.

Now every time I feel like I have moved on and life is getting good again, I keep being knocked down.

My father was really mad at me for losing my job. To others he kept saying how proud he is, but he never said it to me.
My father was violent once to me and my mother and until today he keeps offending my mom verbally.

Today he asked me if I could help him, because he was on ebay and someone sold him something wrong, and therefore he wanted to report it to the police,which is why he asked me if he needs anything more.
I was helping him, and trying to explain everything to him, but he was always saying that I was wrong.
I kept calm and kept on explaining, but it ended up in him saying ""That is why you lost your job as a police man"", which broke my heart.

I told him to fuck off in a serious manner, and right now I am sitting in my room and almost crying.

I was so happy to finally be able to move on in my life, but right now it all crumbles again, just as I thought things would be better again.

I lost my big love, the job I was dreaming of since years and Corona leaves me alone in my house as well.

Whenever I see a post about parents being great or something about a relationship, I directly get sad and I am unsure if I should take a break from social media.

159,"Hi! New to this sub. Long story short, I’ve finally started receiving treatment for mental illness after years of emotional outburst. 
Currently, Drs just think it’s depression and anxiety disorder.
As a result, I’ve just started taking Pristiq (an SNRI) — extremely low dose of 25mg. It’s only been 5 days but I’ve been experiencing pretty severe apathy/emotional blunting. 

It’s reach the point that I’m extremely unproductive. At work, I just sit at my desk. Now I’m falling behind because I literally cannot be bothered to do anything. At home, I’ve let my place go because, again, idgaf.

I haven’t been talking as much either because I just don’t care about relationships.

I can’t feel any emotion — good or bad. I’d say it’s frustrating me but I can’t for the life of me feel frustrated.

I have an appointment with my psychiatrist next week. So hopefully I can figure medicine out.

In the meantime, I’d love advice on how to find motivation, pleasure, etc. while experiencing extreme apathy / emotional blunting.",14May2020,1
160,"My (24F) 26 year old sister is going through a series of problems she’s had her whole life: she is having trouble with schooling, she doesnt enjoy speaking to her friends or anyone outside of her family, and she has very low self esteem issues. She doesn’t have any plans for her future, and she isn’t great with how she spends her money. She gets extremely anxious when she talks about her future— she doesn’t like to think or talk about it at all. She has very critical thoughts about herself as well, calling herself a “loser” and “stupid” often, among other things. When her closest friend and I try and talk with her about these things, she shuts down. She says these kind of confrontations “scar” and “traumatize” her, even though we try to tell her as gently as we can that she should consider therapy to solve her problems, or even just talk to us about what’s on her mind, but she never does.  Progress was made when she decided to go to the psychiatrist for her trouble focusing in school, and she was prescribed a gentler version of adderall, but she said it didn’t really help her. I’m particularly worried bc I suffer from depression and I used to have very bad psychosis, and im afraid that some of the things I’ve been seeing from her are symptoms of psychosis, like paranoia (for example, she asked me if me and her friends secretly think she has autism—of course we don’t, and it’s a very illogical and irrational delusion to think that your closest people would say something like that). Anyway, long story short, her birthday is coming up and my friend and I are trying to think of ways to help her start to lead a happy and thriving life without hurting her feelings or making her think we are looking down on her or trying to change her. We came across life coaching as a possible option—seems like a less intimidating version of a therapist that we can organize ourselves. What do you all think—is this offensive or meddlesome?

Whenever I've started a new job I experience a lot of anxiety for the first few months until I feel comfortable, but lets throw in starting a new job plus living in a new state ...during a pandemic. 
Now, let's throw in leaving my therapist whom I've been seeing for at least 4 years now.  She was the first therapist that I truly connected with and that I can actually trust.  

I'm so scared!  I'm leaving literally everything behind, (yes I made this decision myself) and I'm terrified of what could happen.  My mind is full of 'what if...' thoughts and I won't have someone who I can trust to help me work through these thoughts and problems.  Sure, I could a new therapist, friends, and I'll still be able to visit my family...but until I'll be settled, it's going to be a constant state of stress and I dont know how much I can handle.",14May2020,1

Yet something feels incomplete. Is it the friends? Perhaps. I mean I haven’t had many friends even when I was in school, probably because I was overweight earlier and was bullied because of that.
Now I’m a much more confident person. I don’t want to change much about my personality, but I constantly wonder what’s so unlikable about me that people don’t want to associate with me. 
I’m in touch with old friends. They talk, we become pretty close and then I’m the one making all the efforts to maintain the relationship (texting, reacting to stories, sending memes, calling, etc.)
Something just.. idk.. is maybe a turn off and then all of a sudden they move on with their lives.

164,"I’m just really confused and scared right now and I don’t know what to do. 

My boyfriend and I started experimenting with LSD in February or March. We’d buy like 10-12 tabs once a month and split it, so we were both tripping like two to three times a month. I thought it really helped me work through some of my feelings and trauma, but I did have a couple trips that weren’t really enjoyable. I know my boyfriend had one bad trip that I helped him through, but other than that, he’s been fine. He did start talking about stuff that didn’t really make sense though, so I told him maybe LSD wasn’t right for him if he can’t differentiate reality from fantasy, and that I thought he should get help. He said he was fine. 

Over the past couple weeks, it got worse though. He got angry easier, and he would be mean when he was angry. We’ve always had arguments, but he never insulted me during these arguments until recently, when he started calling me fucked up, selfish, a bitch, etc. Finally, he said he was gonna seek psychiatric help. I thought things were gonna get better, that he was gonna get help and come out of this experience as a better man than he ever was before, but then he told me he didn’t love me on Saturday. I won’t get into much detail, but basically, we spent the next few days alternating between fighting, crying, keeping each other company because neither of us were okay anymore, taking care of each other, and just being heartbroken. I made it clear to him that we could not be together anymore if he really didn’t love me. During all of this, it’s like something in his mind broke. I looked at him and just saw a scared little boy. I should have taken him to the hospital, I know. But I asked him if he needed to go, and he said no. I shouldn’t have listened. I feel so guilty. 

The day after he told me he didn’t love me, he had to go to work. He insisted that I drive him. I was really frustrated by this at the time. He just broke my heart and he’s asking me to drive him somewhere. He told me he felt like if he drove, something bad would happen. I didn’t realize what that meant at the time. I thought he was just being superstitious, because he’s always had sort of odd beliefs, you know. He made me ride with him somewhere the night before because he said he thought something bad would happen if I didn’t come with him, even though I wasn’t driving that time. I don’t know. I should have known. 

I ended up having to pick him up early. I asked him what happened, but he told me he couldn’t remember anything. I asked him if he walked out, and he said that he thought so. Come to find out later, after all this went down, that they actually sent him home because he was so out of it. 

Even though I knew we couldn’t be a couple anymore, I was still afraid to leave him alone, so I asked if he wanted to come with me to my mom’s, and he said yes. I fell asleep, and during this time, he went and knocked on our neighbor’s door, and all he said was my name. He couldn’t even form sentences, apparently. I did notice that it became harder for him to talk, that he had to start whispering. I just thought it was because he was so upset. I didn’t find out about this incident with the neighbor until everything was over either. 

He wakes me up at 3am and told me he was leaving. This came as a shock, and made me mad at first. He just walked out the door without giving me a hug or anything. I thought he meant he was going home to his mom’s. But I called him and he told me was going to die. I chased after him down the street, and he just kept insulting me, saying terrible things to me that I knew he’d never say under normal circumstances. I called his mom to come pick him up. That was Tuesday. 

Now I find out that he’s in the hospital, that he can’t form sentences, all he can say is “sorry.” I thought everything was gonna be okay, that he just needed therapy and he’d be fine and we could be friends after all this. Now I don’t know if I’m ever gonna be able to talk to him again, if he’s ever gonna be able to live a normal life again. I know I did try to get him to seek help, but I didn’t realize his mental problems were gonna be this serious. I feel so guilty for not taking the signs more seriously. I never knew anything like this would happen. They thought he took drugs, and I told him he didn’t take anything, because as far as I knew, he didn’t. I told them later about the LSD, but I didn’t think that was it, because the last time he took any was the end of April or beginning of May. And anything he took, I took some from the same batch. Now his mom is saying the drugs fried her son’s brain, but wouldn’t my brain be fried too? I’ve always had mental health issues, but I’ve never dealt with dissociating or losing touch with reality. I just don’t know what to think, and there’s nothing I can do. I just want answers, but there are none yet. I don’t know. Has anyone ever seen anything like this happen to someone?",14May2020,1

167,"A bit of context:

I was a student studying computer science (a subject that always came to me easy) at a college in a foreign country. I excelled the first year with top grades, but I started to feel really down after an NDE. I was first diagnosed with depression and general anxiety by a general physician at a clinic and was checked into the Accessible Learning Services program at my college to make things easier for me when I got depressed. In the end it was still too much and the college recommended me take a break and go to my country to get appropriate treatment. On returning to my country and after visiting a mental health clinic, I was formally diagnosed with Affective Instability in Borderline Personality Disorder and put on a course of medicines to help me cope a bit with the emphasis that meds were not the way to solve my problems. I had a lot of fights with my mom during this time and I was very emotionally unstable and suicidal. Still I pulled through somehow and started to do better (I believe because of therapy).

Fast forward a month or two, out of the blue my mom starts to say she has doubts about the clinical psychologist who I was doing talk-therapy sessions with. Apparently he was omitting information about me and my struggles (I wasn't comfortable sharing it with her yet and my therapist respected that as he should). Over the weeks she started to get more and more suspicious of my therapist. My therapist was open about his financial struggles and since we were regulars he mentioned it  in a call I thought it was odd, but I decided to ignore it as simply him being transparent. A few weeks pass again and this time while in a private session with my mom discuss my progress, he asks for 6 months payment in advance since he was having financial troubles. My mom perceived this as him crossing a line which I did as well when she mentioned it. Eventually we decided to just stop going in to see him and instead just only went to see my psychiatrist (who also worked for my psychologist) in another hospital where he worked part-time.

A few months of progress later with my psychiatrist, she is again bringing up the ""fact"" that I don't have BDP and even the psychiatrist is just milking us for cash. What do I do? I have a hard time finding therapists since paranoia is one of my main issues as well. I am alone today as I write this. I am at my wits end. I have a hard time opening up and explaining some of my issues to therapists. Please give me some advice on how to handle my mom and my health.",14May2020,1

I realized that I'm stuck in a sort've mental loop. First state I notice is the aloof, carefree and just downright content with life version of me. Not very productive, semi-pro active and fairly optimistic, just going with the flow. As time passes I get a little anxious and starting thinking alot which triggers the paranoid/insecure part of this cycle. I become very pessimistic just downright edgy and extremely antisocial. Very obsessed with my being, how I look, talk, act, feel, ect. I'm kinda at the tail end of this right now and feeling myself kinda going into the full depressive state. When I'm in that mode I have zero energy to do anything.  I feel physically heavy and mentally clouded, everything sucks and I heavily contemplate suicide. Before I go back to being aloof I do have a brief period where I'm like...zen? Like just firing on all cylinders. Like if I could operate on that level on a daily basis I could probably take over the world...then the cycle continues as normal. 


I should mention this cycle happens in full ~weekly/monthly. Recorded through journaling.

Currently there is a lot of strain and stress going on in our individual lives and in our relationships. Many of us are looking for ways to solve our human problems and now seems to be a good time as we've got some forced time on our hands, as some of us are isolated, lonely, live in fear, conflict and so on.

I can't see any of my friends and family anymore and some of them aren't even keeping in touch online right now so a lot of the people I love the most, the same people I would turn to for comfort in rough times, aren't really in my life right now. Many of my favourite things to do in life and things that I was excited about this year don't exist anymore and I have no idea when or if they're coming back. People keep talking about what might never come back and how we'll be in quarantine for months upon months still. And to top it all off, it seems as though nobody is having any sympathy for anybody that's struggling mentally through this.

I've been lucky enough to find at least one place that focuses on mental issues and that I can turn to for support, but everywhere else feels like an absolute sea of apathy and disrespect. It's pretty messed up that most times the topic of mental health is being talked about, it's about how it's ""not important"" when there are people dying because of the virus and that people suffering need to ""deal with it"", even some people saying that it's disrespectful to be worried about your wellbeing during this. I seriously don't get it at all, how the fuck is it disrespectful to be worried about your own happiness during all this? I understand that others have it worse, I know why lockdown is being put in place and I'm respecting social distancing in every way I can. But because I don't like being thoroughly miserable and stressed every other hour of the day that just invalidates all that and makes me selfish? I don't fucking understand.

I've seen people say that they scared about quarantine ending because they've been much more peaceful and productive during it. But honestly? I wish I was able to enjoy it as much as they are. Especially considering everybody seems to be saying that we're going to be stuck like this for up to a year and even beyond.

188,"Hi everyone, I just had an appointment with a psychiatrist for the first time as an adult. My therapist has believed that I have some form of depression, and was particularly concerned that I could have a form of bipolar. I am aware that I've had persistent depression throughout my life without any manic/hypomanic (not sure yet) episodes. But in the past 6 months I have started to experience them to a slight degree (I fit all criteria except the episodes were only around 5 hours maximum). My psychiatrist is unsure if I lean toward type 1 or 2 bipolar, and is encouraging me to learn more about the condition before I make any decision about medication and to better identify what I'm experiencing. He described it as a likely early stage of bipolar. He of course warned me of risk with SSRIs if I have bipolar, but I consider my depressive episodes a much bigger problem, as I've had depression since I was 12 and I am 21 now, so I'm leaning toward SSRIs. I personally find my any hypomania/mania (again, not sure what to label it) that I've had manageable to a degree, whereas my depression usually isn't. He said that mood stabilizers are complicated medications, so he basically said that I should think about it, talk to people, learn more before making a decision. Would love to hear anyone's experiences with this.

Add on: I had been prescribed an SSRI at 14 for depression and social anxiety, but my treatment was incomplete. It seemed to help a bit in the time I took them, which was only 2 months.

Mood stabilizers - Lamictal, Lithium, Seroquel

SSRIs - Prozac, Wellbutrin",14May2020,2

190,"I’m sure there are a lot of people like me posting here for this advice. My brother, ironically a psych major himself, has had issues for about 8 years now. Once he flunked out of his second college in 2017 my parents somehow got him into an inpatient program that helped him get sober from alcohol and weed, and got him an apartment at his third college where he actually got straight A’s and graduated with a psych degree in 2019 at age 25. We thought maybe he could turn his life around. 

His program also diagnosed him with some type of bipolar, paranoia and cycling thoughts. He briefly got on meds and then declared he didn’t like how he felt and got off them. He went to two psychiatrists of his choosing afterward and declared them also wrong about his diagnosis. 

When things are going his way and he’s happy he’s okay to be around (if you want to get pizza and watch a movie with him he’s fine). Most of the rest of the time he ranges from mildly annoying to insufferable. He flies off the handle at the slightest provocation, telling him to wash his dishes will turn into a 30 min rant about how his family ruined his life by giving him a lecture junior year of high school to do well on the ACT. He tells all of us to fck off, die, calls us retarded on a regular basis. He’s been living at home since graduating working a $15/hour job at a special needs rec facility that has been shut down in the pandemic. He’s driving my parents to the edge of their sanity. 

He alternates between an attitude of this is his calling and he’s sooo good hearted and not meant for the capitalist world to grand declarations of getting his PhD and treating special needs kids. We have found him salaried jobs he can get with his bachelors and he always says he will apply and never does. He refuses to even see a talk therapist let alone get on meds. I can’t convey without writing pages and pages how obnoxious and volatile his behavior is. He also can’t function if anything is mildly out of the norm. His phone is about to fall apart but he is overwhelmed at the anxiety of setting up a new iPhone and wants someone to do it for him. 

My sisters think my parents should kick him out and let him flounder in “the real world” and that will give him the much-needed kick in the rear to get help and get his life together 

My parents are afraid this approach will lead him to committing suicide or ending up homeless and we won’t be able to find him. 

My mother is now a depressed wreck who spends all her time besides actual chores sitting on the couch crying about him. This is going to destroy my family. 

Please, can anyone tell me how they got their loved one to accept help and medication?",14May2020,1

193,"My mom after finding out I want to kill my self, self harm, and basically have depression has decided to announce to the world everything. First of all I found out she was leaving out no detail in emails to my AP US History teacher and counselor, now you may say she should be giving details is a matter of health, no she included details that were better left unsaid such as my brother crying begging me to stop hurting myself, something that confirmed the walls and hallways in these house are basically nonexistent. Then I learned that she posted about me on Facebook to her fellow religious Karen’s (mom isn’t white, she’s Puerto Rican, but acts as if she’s a Karen with her conservatism and belief that faith in god will cure me), and I was like “are you serious? So you’re just going to announce to the world about me?” And she’s like “I’m trying to get as much help for you” and In my mind I’m like what in the fucking hell, asking these, in my eyes, Karen fanatics for help for a condition that is within my mind and scientific is not how you get help. I only want a therapist or some other social worker and them only. Cause they’re the only ones, hopefully, who know how to act with someone like me.

I am creating a social media account for a client of mine who is a psychologist (therapist). She specializes in teen girls and anxiety specifically, but sees people of all ages, genders, and also couples. She is an amazing therapist and I am hoping to extend her reach of people she helps by creating a booming social media presence for her.

My question for you:

\-If you had access to a psychologist, what question about mental health would you ask?

My goal is to have her answer questions that are really useful to people, so I will be using your questions and interviewing her for answers, and then posting them on her socials. Chances are, if you have a mental-health related question or topic that you need guidance in, someone else does too.

Thank you so much in advance for your help!

198,"I've always hated things covering my face/mouth. Especially how the masks can do that. Of course, I'm going to wear them, because keeping myself/everyone else safe is more important than my issue of discomfort.

I do not really know where this issue comes from, or what triggers it. I can all out freak out if my head gets stuck in clothes. I remember that even affecting me as a kid, so it goes back to something.

You would think the constant exposure would make this issue better, going forward, but it's actually getting worse as time moves forward. I've tried the regular dust masks, the doo rags, bandanas stuff like that to see if there's a more comfortable material that doesn't make me feel so cut off from air, but it honestly doesn't seem to matter.

Today it culminated into a full on panic attack in the middle of grocery shopping. It just felt like I wasn't getting air. I tried doing the standard calming exercises, leaning over the cart, etc, but honestly, I needed to rip the mask off. My brain was convinced I was drowning. I couldn't do that in the store, because I really felt like I was already getting the, ""Sick person sick person,"" stares and avoidances. I abandoned my cart in the middle of wherever aisle I was, and just walked out of the store getting dizzier and dizzier. Once I hit the outside, I ran a little bit away from the door and ripped my mask off.

I was trying so hard to breathe, like, honestly I acted like I just came up from the water after almost drowning. I was gulping in air as fast as I could and coughing at the same time. I had my hand around my throat like I was choking.

People made comments. It was extremely embarssing and I felt like I was being shunned and judged. Like I had the plague. ""You shouldn't be out here if your sick."" ""Put your mask on."" ""Do you wanna make everyone sick?"" I'm away from anywhere where I'm blocking people, there's no store there or anything. Even if I was sick, no one was possibly close enough to catch it, unless they specifically went out of there way to walk up to me, where there wasn't even an entrance. I heard someone say something about getting a manager, and in an attempt to hide/calm down, without adding the pressure of judgement, I went to the side of the store, closer to where they were doing construction on the parking lot, but this is one of the first nice days we've had, and no matter where I went, there were people. 

I sat on the sidewalk to kinda calm down/almost cry, really. I wasn't breathing that way anymore, but I was shaking. I felt like I was having a heart attack, and was kinda fetal position, just trying to calm down so I could drive (I didn't have a mask anymore, and wasn't gonna go back to the store.) A nice old woman did see me there and actually asked if I was ok, which was really nice that someone showed a little sympathy. I told her I felt fine, but something went down the wrong tube (just easier to explain) and coughing in the store got me looks. She said she totally understood and then asked if I needed a mask. I told her I lost it while choking, I didn't realize I didn't even have it on anymore. She said she understood, and offered me a new one. I said no thank you, whatever, that I made a complete fool of myself in the store, I just wanted to go home.

We just kinda had a pleasant conversation, and she honestly helped me just by talking to me. I did see the manager looking around for me, but he didn't approach us. He called out if I was ok, I said, ""wrong tube,"" whatever, he gave me a thumbs up. I got up and told the nice lady I think it's better if I go home, and we said goodbye whatever.

I'm explaining everything to my wife. She's pretending that everything is ok, and sort of acting sympathetic, but I can tell she's peeved I showed up with no food/supplies. She doesn't understand why I didn't go back in, or cared what other ppl think.

So, after all that off my chest rant, when you get a serious, serious panic attack like that, what do you do? I can have anxiety and can have small anxiety attacks, but I can work thru those. I haven't had somethin that major, like, almost passing out/heart attack, nothing could stop it attack, since I was a teenager. I think it's stress, but it just came out of nowhere. Usually I can catch it, you know. But this came full blown, no warning, just total meltdown, get this off my face, floor left my feet, tunnel vision, shaking to the point my body thinks it must be freezing, hell. 

I'm afraid it may happen again, and I don't know what to do in that situation. I know the mask is really what perpetuated it, for the most part, because it has given me anxiety attacks in the past. But nothing like this. Does anyone have any tips? Does anyone have these problems when things cover your face and how are you getting thru with the new mask only policies? Any tips on things that work with the masks? Keep in mind, scarfs give me the same problem in the winter. I can cover my neck, kinda adjust them so the keep my ears warm, but don't put them around my face. 

Thanks for listening to my little rant, and I'm sorry this is so long.

TL;DR: Struggling with wearing masks, to the point of having a full blown panic attack happen in the grocery store. Need tips on how to handle something as extreme as that doesn't involve just letting myself pass out because I think I'm drowning.",14May2020,1

200,"I feel as though I am so different to most humans, it doesn't bother me too much, I love who I am, but I just want to know WHY and should I see somebody. I am clearly not normal and would be interested to hear any thoughts about the way I am. 

I will list some things that are odd about me that I have noticed:

-My emotions are very neutral and exist on a very limited spectrum, I do not get happy or sad, I often feel irritation towards people but I am easily amused, however most of the time I don't feel much at all, I'm not sure if it's contentness or numbness.

-I have preferred my own company since childhood, and have found other human beings to be an annoyance, I was normal prior to about age 5 as there are videos of me being normal, but since the beginning of primary school I have memories of being strange and preferring to be by myself and viewing others as immature.

-I had a group of friends who I enjoyed being with once in my life, between the age of 12-14, but there was no emotional bond between me and them, one day we fell out, they bullied me badly but I was astonishingly unnaffected. I have been asking myself for years why is somebody like me not depressed or suicidal. 

-I have never had an emotional bond with another human being in my life and I don't desire one. 

-I do not react to events which would probably make most humans feel a great deal of pain, I am extremely blunted. I have been blunted for as long as I can remember. 

-I was raised by a cold father and an overly emotional mother. I hate my mother, we do not have contact. 

-I am asexual, aromantic, sex repulsed, touch repulsed (apart from say a handshake), I have hated touch from a young age as I viewed it as unnecessary and weird.

-I am incredibly self sufficient, I have only relied on myself for my entire life and I am content in doing so. I do not understand why human beings rely on other human beings. 

-I am incredibly narcissistic, I view my not needing friends, my inability to feel sadness, my thick skin, my self sufficiency etc. as making me superior. I view most human beings as weak, I find them so amusing to observe. 

-I am incredibly selfish and feel no guilt for this. I view altruistic people as pathetic and laughable.

-I sometimes have homicidal thoughts, I often daydream about school shootings, I do not have the means to carry one out, if I lived in a country with easy access to guns then perhaps I would.

-I know I am not a good person, yet I love myself and feel no guilt or remorse about it. 

-I spend most of my days daydreaming, the majority of the time it is introspection about myself or contemplating life. (Edit : the homicidal thoughts aren't every day, probably 3 or 4 days a week for short periods of time) 

-I have no hobbies, only things I do to pass time, I cannot derive any enjoyment from much at all. Apart from listening to music, that is the one thing I genuinely enjoy and cherish.

-I am innately non conformist, I have always done my own thing, unaffected by trends, peer pressure, indoctrination, rules or praise and criticism from others. I am often in trouble for my ""attitude"". I do not go out of my way to get in trouble. 

-Others have described me using adjectives such as cold, robot, unemotional, weird, serious, unenthusiastic.
 
-Where most narcissists need validation from others, I am a self validating narcissist, I only care for my own opinion. I don't care for others and like to be left alone all the time. I am only really narcissistic in my own mind. 

-I have zero motivation or goals, I exist only to pass time, I am an empty shell of a human being (but still I love myself and find myself fascinating)

-I am apathetic towards most things, be it politics, kids with cancer, people dying from the coronavirus, I just don't care at all. I have no strong opinions. 

-My voice is extremely monotonous.

-I can read other human beings like a book, yet they cannot read me. I can notice the slightest change in tone and expression. I am brilliant at knowing when people lie.

-I view my life as a sheer vanity project, I am obsessed with my appearance, fashion and makeup, I treat myself like some sort of doll. I am addicted to shopping as well. And I have an eating disorder (yes you can have an ED and be narcissistic) I am very vain and self absorbed.

-I have zero emotional empathy, only cognitive empathy. 

-I am extremely chilled and laid back, I cannot feel worry, distress or anxiety. Sometimes I get slightly anxious around extroverts I suppose. 

-I have zero highs and lows in mood, I am just so oddly neutral. 

-I have had a lot of Internet friends in the past, I tend to grow bored of them though. But they are better than ones in real life. 

-Despite my narcissism I can appear very polite and nice. 


-I have had all of these traits for a long time now. 


I am 19 and female. I am clearly not normal am I? Yet I have never set foot in the office of a therapist or taken any medication.
I have been in a psychiatrists office on two occasions, both were to be assessed for aspergers when I was younger which I do not have, I used to think I did, but i cannot relate to those types at all. 
I have suspected for a while that I may have a personality disorder or disorders, potentially one or a combination of schizoid personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder or antisocial personality disorder. As the way I am seems far too rigid for it to be a mood disorder. My self aware introspective nature means that I could potentially (unlike most narcissists and sociopaths) be aware of the way that I am. 

I am not too bothered about the way I am, again I am extremely apathetic so I find it hard to be bothered (yes I am typing this out so I do care slightly I suppose) It would be nice to change the lack of motivation and goals(as this has a negative affect on my life), as well as the inability to enjoy things I suppose. I do not know what it would be like to enjoy things, as I never have, I was forced into hobbies when I was younger but hated them all. The other aspects of myself I am unwilling to change as I love most things about myself. 

So, why am I so odd? Do I have some undiscovered mental illness? Could it be a personality disorder? Can my lack of goals and motivation be treated? I would be very surprised if I am not mentally ill?...

Has anyone ever heard of a person like me? 
Could I benefit from, I feel sick even typing the word, some help ?",14May2020,1
201,"Recently, I've been thinking about my father's narcissistic personality disorder and how he likely inherited it from my grandmother.

Below is an explanation of my grandmother's impact on her children, and I'll explain at the end with a TLDR what I think should be done in order to avoid being damaged by a bad parent.

My grandmother was as controlling and manipulative as a person can be. She had five children, and she scarred each one of them in some way.

The oldest child, who passed away a few years ago, could not make decisions on his own. He needed a maternal figure in his life so that he could get approval before making decisions. He was a great teacher and a very gentle person all around. He was never unpleasant to be around, at least for me. However, he did have quite a hard time with social cues. He lived with his sister, and he found safety in living with her because she would give him permission to do things. My grandmother wasn't as obviously abusive towards him; they seemed to maintain quite a good relationship. But he felt the need to always call her before taking a decision when she was still alive, because she convinced him since childhood that he's not good enough to do anything without her permission. She would often reward his submissive behavior with compliments.

My father is the second oldest child and is basically the male version of my grandmother. I've even come up with the metaphor that he was the chosen one to carry her personality now that she's dead. He is your typical narcissist: controlling, arrogant, throws often child-like fits when he doesn't get his way, and so on. My grandmother used to always compare him to the oldest child, making him feel bad for not being as submissive. As such, he's always been rebellious when it came to her, but deep down, he just wanted to be loved. My grandmother ruined my father by teaching him to see people only for their achievements and good behavior. She didn't love him unconditionally. She'd reward being ""different"" as well. So nowadays, he's always trying to be the odd person in any group, and he also tries to behave properly around authority figures so that he can receive validation for good behavior. He's very shallow in his search for the love his mother never gave him.

The third child, I don't really know much about. A stereotypical way to describe him would be a comparison to the Grinch. He's moody - similarly to my father. I think he was kind of an onlooker as a child - my grandmother focused more on the other children. He doesn't enjoy making his emotions visible and might have some narcissistic traits as well.

The fourth child is an example of what people should be like when their parents are more damaging than loving. While she didn't come out unscathed, she went out there, became a teacher, traveled throughout the country and met all sorts of people. She did not let her mother's personality become the voice at the back of her head dictating her every step. She must've had some point in her life where she realized something wasn't right, and that she needed to think for herself.

The fifth child is extremely insecure. He's even more dependent than the first child was. I think part of what has damaged him even further is how my father went on to abuse him after my grandmother died. As my uncle tried to learn things from my father, my father took on a dominant role and has been abusive towards him ever since by degrading my uncle and overall just making him feel like a lesser human being, a failure and so on. The silver lining here, though - my uncle is about the be a father now, and it seems something has ""clicked"" for him. He has been avoiding contact with my father, which obviously drives my father nuts...but that's his problem, not my uncle's. I think that's the greatest decision he's ever made.

So here's the bottom line/**TLDR**: sometimes, you just have to let go. You have to decide that you want to go out there, meet new people and begin the process of breaking free from that dominant person's voice at the back of your head. Sadly, no contact might be the way to go. Don't settle for something that hinders your progress under the shallow pretext of ""family love.""

This voice at the back of your head telling you to not do certain things might not be a family member's; it could be that bully from school or a ""friend"" you once had. It doesn't matter, really. You have to detect whose voice it is and get rid of it. Detect, hunt down, and destroy.",14May2020,1

212,I have anxiety most of the time. Maybe that has a part in it?,14May2020,1
213,"First of all, hi. Thanks for taking the time to read this. I work at a counseling center that offers a wide variety of outpatient services including but not limited to individual therapy, psychiatry, peer support, and housing and job placement. I want to start by saying that I love, or at least, I loved doing what I do. I'm an admissions clerk. When new clients want to come in and set up services, I'm their first point of  contact. It's my job to get all their information plugged into our EHR while also getting an idea of what's bringing them in and what they're looking for.

I'm exhausted. I actually used to be a client here several years prior to getting my job. I've lived with depression and anxiety for half my life now, and I'm no stranger to how it makes me feel. I've been bored with jobs before, but this is on another level. I feel absolutely drained. Mental health is something deeply personal to me and when I started here I cared a lot about what I do and I want to believe that I still do care, and I'm just having a rough patch. Between my own depression and the coronavirus making everything tense and the fact that it feels like we're all burning our collective candles at both ends here at my job because of this new situation with the pandemic, I am so tired I don't want to do anything but sleep. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I make myself sit up and try to play a video game in the evenings because I KNOW that usually I enjoy gaming (or have enjoyed it in the past) because I know I shouldn't just go home from work and go straight to bed but even that feels like yet another chore.

Before I go get my clients to help them at work, I have to physically stop myself and take some deep breaths and say ""okay, pretend to care!"" and that makes me feel like a horrible person because I SHOULD care and I have cared about it in the past, and my clients deserve better than that from me. 

I'm 30. I'm single. I have no kids. I feel profoundly alone. I hate my city. I've lived here my whole life and I want to move away and start over somewhere new, but I don't have the money for that kind of undertaking. Every day feels like the same thing over and over. I spend all day pretending to care about other people's problems when on the inside I can't even be bothered to care about myself properly.

I feel like the simple solution is ""well just take a mental health day."" So I did that Monday. I spent most of it sleeping. I won't say I really enjoyed it, aside from the fact that I didn't have to spend the day making sure my voice had the right inflection when I talked instead of sounding like a robot, or trying to arrange my facial expression into the appropriate level of friendly, caring concern I usually have to put on during the week and that was nice. It's Thursday and I'm right back to feeling like I'd rather I just didn't exist anymore. Before you ask, no, I'm not feeling actively suicidal. I don't have any kind of a plan in place. That would be entirely too much effort for how tired I am. Besides, I don't wish I was dead. I just wish I didn't exist, at least as far as having obligations and having to interact with other humans.

I'm still taking my medication daily. I'm on Effexor 75mg. I'm still making myself bathe and go to work on time every morning. I've gotten really, really good at doing the absolute bare minimum to keep myself looking functional enough that I don't set off the warning bells of the people around me. But I guess a part of me is worried that this situation is untenable. I don't know how long I can go before I start to slip more. A part of me doesn't really care. A part of me thinks that maybe if I fuck up dramatically enough my aunts and uncle and father will be more forgiving of me-- like if it looks like I haven't been suffering that much, they'll think I'm just being selfish and overdramatic. Then again, I guess I absolutely am selfish, so here we are.

I don't know where I'm going with this anymore. I've rambled too much already. I'm sorry for that. I guess ultimately I'm just here because I don't know what else to do. I don't want to talk to my relatives about this because they wouldn't understand. I don't want to talk to my coworkers about this because all I would get is the clinical line, all the shit I already know. So, I'm sorry. Thanks again for reading through my garbage.",14May2020,2
214,"I’m sure the title is confusing but I’m not quite sure how to phrase this, honestly. Apologies in advance if the structure of this post is messy - my thoughts are pretty unorganised - but I hope that it makes sense somehow! It’s also extremely long, but I just wanted to vent, honestly. I’m writing this on mobile, so I apologise for any technical issues. 

To start off, I’ve been struggling with my mental health for as long as I can remember. Not as much as someone with a mental illness would, I’m sure, but there have been several month long periods of time where I would constantly and seriously contemplate suicide for no particular reason, and mildly self-harmed.

It might sound insensitive, but during these times I would often lowkey wish I was diagnosed with depression so that I could justify these feelings in some way. This is rather important in regards to my current situation.

(I’ve never experienced anything particularly traumatic, so I don’t have any significant reason as to why this happens. I know that that isn’t always the cause of mental illnesses, but objectively I’ve always lived a comfortable life and I have an amazing family, so I really don’t have a clear reason as to why I feel this way.)

Anyways, these episodes of time would often come to pass and I would tell myself that it was over - that chapter of my life was done and I could move on and appreciate the present. But of course, the COVID-19 outbreak arrived, and it coincided with the beginning of another low episode. 

At the time, I was already feeling extremely unmotivated and would often miss turning in assignments despite how important my grades were: I’m on a 50% scholarship and I need to maintain a high grade in order to keep it. I felt extremely guilty and scared, but I was just so lazy and unmotivated. Quarantine was a way to be even lazier. I ignored online school and shunned all my responsibilities. I felt dread and fear at the consequences at first, but I honestly couldn’t bring myself to do anything.

As time passed, I could kind of feel myself shut down my emotions. I just didn’t want to think about it anymore and I didn’t want to face the results of my laziness. 

At some point, I started feeling disconnected. I could barely remember who I was or feel any connection to my environment or my memories and emotions. It felt like I was - am - watching life through a glass bottle.

I just felt apathetic at first. But now it just feels wrong. Like I’m not supposed to be here at all. It feels like I’m a different person who got their memory wiped and put in another body with someone else’s memories. Or like I died and everyone, including me, forgot that I’m dead.

I can still sometimes feel emotions physically, but it just feels like I’m shut off from feeling anything on an emotional level: I could be crying and feel physical sadness, but it’s easy for me to just switch it off.

But honestly the whole situation really really just feels like it’s all fake. Like I’m lying to myself and trying to find an excuse for my laziness and trying to offset the consequences. I’m pretty sure that I’m just lying to myself. It would make sense, given that I wanted to be diagnosed with depression. Anyways, how do I know that this isn’t how everyone feels and I’m just being overdramatic? 

I’m a very insecure and overly emotional person in general, so I’m sure that this is just some unconscious ploy to get attention and an excuse for not doing work. Besides, I don’t want to self-diagnose myself and add to the stigma around mental health.

I really wanted to tell someone. I vented about it to my friends, to people I knew online. It just felt like nobody took me seriously. I know that everyone’s struggling, especially in this time, but I was told by someone that they knew exactly how I felt, and I would feel better if I just kept a journal. 

I’m still acting normal and cracking jokes, so I can definitely see why they don’t think it’s all that serious though. I’m on a throwaway account right now, because my IRLs know my main.

The only person who really made me feel heard was my sister: I felt so much better after talking to her but I still felt so disconnected and after about two days of feeling better, the low feeling just returned and I’m back to how I was before. 

I know that I should reach out for professional help. I’m lucky enough to attend a school with a psychiatrist. But I just don’t want to take attention away from the people who actually need help in this time. 

Truthfully, I’m really scared that I’ll find out that I am genuinely faking this and I won’t have any good reason for my unproductivity. I know my parents wouldn’t take me seriously either, and I would be seriously hurt that they didn’t.

I know I should contact my school psychiatrist. I know that I should do something before it’s too late. But I’m so scared that my feelings aren’t real and I won’t have any good reason for missing my responsibilities. 

I don’t know what to do. I wish whoever really owns this body comes back soon before I screw up their lives irreversibly. 

Anyways, if you read until the end of this ungodly long rant, thank you so so much - I don’t know why anyone would subject themselves to this gibberish. I’m not quite sure how to end this in a meaningful way, but it seriously means a lot to me that you read through this. Thank you.",14May2020,1
216,"Honestly I have no clue on whats wrong with me, but there’s definitely something wrong. 
Firstly my mood swings are horrible its like I’ll feel normal but then suddenly my switch flips and I get this sinking feeling in my heart and emptiness in my head, so i might cry for days or hours i don’t know. I always feel fine when I’m outside around people but when I step foot home it’s like sadness overcomes. 
This one time i was scrolling on reddit and just started crying like out of blue. There is no reason for me to cry my life is almost what i wanted. 
One time i cried so hard for 2 days i lost weight and it affected my menstrual cycle. I’m ashamed but sometimes when it gets very harsh i self harm. I cry on the subway i cry when I’m walking home doesn’t matter whenever my switch flips I’ll cry. 
Side note- my coworkers have asked my if I’m bipolar but I honestly dont think its that, my mood changes way too frequently for it to be bipolar and i dont have any psychotic symptoms either. 
I dont think its depression either because sometimes i do feel happy and i have nothing to cry about. I think it’s my mind playing games.",14May2020,1
217,"TLDR: I want to be in psychosis again, and feel like I could manage it. Does anyone do this? / thoughts?

I tell people this and they seem to be confused. Everyone seems to think of it as a scary thing, but to me there were times I slightly scared myself, but it was really a beautiful connection I had with my subconscious that helped me understand myself better.

I am now on medication: Lithium 600mg and seroquil 25mg, and have constant headaches and dizziness that prevents me from being able to drive.

I was able to drive perfectly and everything and it was as if I were living in a heaven like world while I had psychosis with more motivation than I've ever had because even the smallest things were fun. I feel like if I were to go back to this mindset, I would understand it with the foresight I have now, and I would love my life again.

221,"Okay so I’ve been dealing with trauma I have, I was molested at a young age and it’s really hard to deal with.

I already had anxiety and depression before I recovered these so called “memories”, and my anxiety got way worst to the point I kinda just have panic attacks everyday.

Whenever I think about it, it feels like I’m reliving it... I can feel myself being touched again and see the scenery where we were... and I can see it through my point of view, like I’m that little girl again.

After I got these “memories” I have almost these up and down days. Where one day I wanna clean and do all these things with my life but I still feel really anxious and scared, and then the next I feel so depressed and I want to kill myself, and I have no motivation to do anything. It feels like I’m two completely different people living in one body. And they switch between weeks or days.

Honestly I just think it’s best if I kill myself because I can’t handle it anymore, my mental health is so bad I just can’t do it anymore.

I’m only 14 to dealing with all of this, I tried to open up to my mom but she just gets pissed off at me and questions me for everything I do. 

And since I have no friends either I can’t open up to anyone else. 

And another thing is it normal for me to recover “memories” like this at my age? I’ve been questioning myself about if these “memories” are even real because normally people recover them at a later age.

224,"Does anyone else have this?

It can litteraly be anything. When I dont have my assignments finished i think ' i should just kill myself.'its the same as when even something as little happens like when i drop something.
Im a really akward person and socializing isnt really one of my strengths..When im in bed and i think back to akward situations i feel so crappy and break down and think ""i am going to commit suicide"". 

When my parents say something (building critism) that upsets me i used to just tear up and cry and they got mad cuz i was acting like a baby and wanted attention.  But now i just go upstairs or walk my dogs whenever i have to cry. Its just whenever ANYTHING happens that isnt in my favor, i think about killing myself and i start planning it in my mind.


I really dont want to be here. But i still love my parents and friends and i dont want them to be sad. Imagining their reaction they would be really sad. I would jump off a building and my parents/friends would eventually be notified and they would be so sad. But I cant do this anymore. I don't belong. And not in my environment, but i dont belong in life.

227,"I have attended a school in New York City for the past eleven years. Like many other graduates this year I'm struggling to come to terms with the end of my school career there.

As background, my class is very small, only 39 people. I know each and every one of them very well. I am very active in the community. I am the student council president and editor of the newspaper, not because I'm an overachiever, I genuinely love engaging in school activities. At the beginning of the year, I knew that graduation and my last semester would be hard but that was back in a time when there wasn't a pandemic and all our classes are virtual. I  thought that this semester would be a time when I could come to terms with my time at my school ending.

Since the rest of the school year has been canceled, it's felt like I've already left, making the possibility of closing out my time there feel impossible. I know that it isn't but these stupid zoom classes don't offer the same opportunities that would have made it possible to do so.

Knowing this has made me incredibly moody, irritating to be around, and mostly just depressed (I am not using that term lightly either). I know that I'm in the same boat as many people but does anyone know a way to cushion the blow of such an intense feeling of loss?",14May2020,2

It doesn't work. 

I've been trying to keep positive or at bare minimum, keep calm. I've been drinking more water, treating myself to nice skin care products and working out everyday. I'm down and I just can't seem to help it. 

But now I've just spent 2 days working on some art that I was really excited about and now I'm done, I can't feel proud. I feel like I haven't done my best.

I feel incredibly low about everything even when I'm trying as hard as I can or not trying at all it's the same.

My partner is working so hard to keep me afloat and reassure me and let me know he's proud, and I want to show him I'm grateful by showing him its working, that he's enough and I'm happy and that I love him for always being there for me.

But mental health just doesn't work like that. Sometimes your brain is off balance and any joy is so easily snatched away and it's really dark up there.

I'm sorry to moan about it here, I just needed someone to hear me that it wasn't going to hurt. I'm grateful for all of you, and I hope you're all doing the best you can. Everything is hard for everyone right now for all kinds of reasons and I want everyone to be alright.",14May2020,1

232,"My best friend recently just screwed me over by stealing my business idea and remaking it into his. No, I'm not being dramatic, he quite literally ditched our agreed-upon partnership just hours after I revealed my written timeline and said that he was going to start his own similar business.

My other best friend has also hurt me more times than I can count, but she's not the least apologetic. She always says that she doesn't feel sorry about what she did, so she doesn't think that she should apologize. It's insane, because I would assume any sane person could realize their faults, especially if they've done the things she has done.

I just constantly feel like I'm being screwed over by these 2 friends, and I can never seem to get over it. I know that I should own up to my feelings and ditch them for good, but I am just too attached to them. I'm also scared that they'll belittle my emotions if I tell them how I feel. 

The last time friend #2 betrayed my trust, the FaceTime call started with me asking for an explanation and ended with the two of them ridiculing my every flaw. I understand that those flaws need to be worked on and I apologized, but the two of them do the exact same thing and act like they're superior humans. Friend #2, like always, said that she didn't feel like apologizing for spilling my secret.

I don't think I'm a pushover because I voice my opinions whenever I feel upset, however no matter how many times we hash our problems out, I'm always left feeling unfulfilled and in disbelief as to why they would do that to me in the first place. They've both expressed their annoyance with how I can't get over some things.

I just feel constantly unhappy because of these two people, and I don't know if I'm just expecting perfection with my too many emotions, or if they're legitimately toxic people. I don't think that I'll be able to drop them, because when things aren't bad, they're *really* good.

235,"Here's some backstory on my uneventful life,

Hopeless 24m middle school computer teacher here from rural Indiana. Life. Yeah, it sucks for everyone right now... I debated about posting this because the last thing others need during this time is to read or hear about someone else's issues lol, but surprisingly here I am. I am a very quiet person, but I love technology, music, and especially video games. Honestly, music and video games are pretty much the only things I enjoy out of life. I don't really know who else to talk to, so I'll spill my guts here ;)

My entire life I've struggled with a weight problem, and learning how to care and love myself. My brain is hardwired to where I have to be a pleaser for everyone. Basically, I help everyone else out with whatever it is they need, and I ignore myself. I care and give advice to friends, but I won't even look at myself in a mirror. I hate myself. I hate everything about myself. There is nothing that I like about myself or my body. I'm incredibly insecure, and I am very paranoid about it. To the point that I always put on a fake smile to please others, so they don't view me negatively.

I've always felt that everything I've ever done has been for nothing, I have left little to no impact on anyone else's lives on this planet, and if I was gone tomorrow maybe 2 people might be upset and forget about me after a while. 

Due to this... ""mentality"", I've hurt myself trying to live this entire time. The past 24 years have been nothing but being on autopilot for me, and I don't know how to help myself. I do not enjoy life, but I don't hate it. I don't understand it, that's for sure. I didn't ask for any of this. I also think I'm very selfish/childish for thinking this way.

I am broken, beaten down, tired, angry, frustrated, confused, scared, and worried about my mental health, my future, and my life (what little effort I've put into it besides fucking video games). I have no direction, no calling, and I'm tired. **I. am. tired.** of living like this. I can't let this go on for too much longer, otherwise... I'm probably going to just give up.

236,"I spent 5 years in a 4’x8′ prison cell.

That cell was the best teacher I have ever had and I am an educated man.

I could tell a million stories. Some horrific, some hilarious, some downright unbelievable. But I want to tell you about the education I received behind those bars. I want to attempt to put into words the process of knowing myself that has changed me forever.

I often tell people that the cost of those 5 years was very high. My wife and children suffered, I suffered. I missed little league sports, elementary graduation, baptisms, Christmases and birthdays. I missed the daily harmony of family life that is so precious.

The strange part of the experience is that I would not change my life. While I would never willingly trade the lost time with my family, as I look back I would not make a single change. **I would not take myself out of that cell.** I am who I am today in part because of the thousands of hours I spent in that place. I like who I am and when I compare my current self with the man I was before, I get sick because of the weakness that was in my character.

The lessons I learned are legion, but I will attempt in this blog post to detail some of them. This is lesson 1.

**I learned who I truly am.**

The first few weeks and months were unbearable. Countless hours with very little to get my mind off of what I had done and the wreckage I had caused. I am sure that more than once I was close to going out of my mind worrying about my family. I also spent tons of wasted time feeling angry. I was angry at my partners who had turned on me, I was angry at the Judge and prosecutor for their behavior. I was angry at God for not intervening. Some of the anger was justified and some was ridiculous. All of it was unnecessary and wasteful.

Over time the anger turned to myself which was were it belonged. I began to dissect my life. I began to accept that the current predicament was of my own doing. When I started doing that something strange happened. I became less angry. I felt a bit of power over my worries and mental state. Each night, when the lights went out, I would take apart another chapter of my life. The deeper I got into my own faults and flaws, the better I felt. That sounds counter intuitive, but that is how I felt. Each step of the process required me to examine my weaknesses and then accept them.

At one point I wrote a list of all the times I had done something to harm someone else. The exercise took me clear back to my childhood. I was able to identify a common character flaw that ran through all of my mistakes.

Once I was completely laid bare, I had a decision to make:

1. Accept myself with all of my flaws and work to get better.
2. Lie to myself and turn pathological and never change.
3. Kill myself out of shame and despair.

Option 3 was a common choice. I considered suicide very seriously for some time. I even went so far as to plan my own death. I am not sure how close I came, but I did make detailed plans on more than one occasion.

Option 2 was the option that the cowards took. This was mostly the religious cowards that continued to think they were Godly and had somehow been wronged. They could not accept that their finely crafted lies and deceptions had been found out and considered themselves front row believers. I have had contact with some of these since being released, they did not change and will continually be weak and deceptive. I steer clear of them.

Option 1 is obviously the right one. This option was the hardest and took more courage than even suicide. One day I woke up and realized that I truly knew myself from the top to bottom. Heart and soul. Also that I could love myself in spite of all the flaws. I could weight the good and bad and accept myself for who I truly was.

This was the beginning of personal power and strength. My situation had not changed. The suffering didn’t stop, but I could then control my feelings. I had taken responsibility for myself and had a daily project to work on.

I am no psychologist, but something about accepting myself gave me control over my emotions and my world. From that point to today I have worked hard to repair flaws in my character. Many flaws still exist, but I know what they are and I work on them one at a time.

It is this first lesson learned in that small cell that has forever changed my life and my world. Lesson 1 will change your life also if you are willing to take the long hard look at yourself and begin the process of acceptance and personal responsibility.

I suffer from depression so I take an SSRI called escitalopram (lexapro in the states). I also ejaculate faster than I'd like, which really affects my confidence in bed. Escitalopram gives me much better control over my ejaculation without reducing my libido by much.

238,"Everything seems to be crashing down on me again. Today I had to admit to myself that I’m barely keeping my head above water mental health wise. I feel lost , I’m not suicidal but I do sometimes feel like it would be easier to not have to deal with everything. 
Currently going through a health scare and I’m hearing the results tomorrow it could be anything varying from something easily fixed to cancer...

I guess I don’t really know what I’m asking or saying here.

I’m not happy with the person I’ve become the last few months.
I value myself by what others think of me and am also paranoid about what it is they think as well.

When people say positive things they don’t really register. I feel like I don’t deserve them.

I landed a new job which is giving me good future opportunities but I keep feeling like I don’t actually deserve it like I’m not qualified or good enough for it. 

I’m insecure about everything but also can’t let go of the past and people who’ve wronged me. 
I push everyone away who matters with my irritability mostly caused by the pain I’ve been having the last 2 months and not knowing what’s going on.

My relationship is long distance , we were planning to move in together this summer but corona happened and now everything is uncertain.

I can not deal with uncertainty, it makes me anxious , I guess I’m a control freak

There are so many things wrong with me.
Can I really still blame the absent narcissistic father who caused daddy issues and abandonment but also commitment issues.
Can I still blame my depressed mother who would gaslight me and pretend she’d kill herself? But got better when she met a man and got married when i was about to leave the house.
She could change for him but not me and my siblings?

But I’m old enough now at 26, to have moved passed these things...
I have had so much time to work on myself and I have worked on myself and it did get better.  But the depression always returns... I’m tired of always having to work on myself and my issues and trying to do and be better

I feel so incredibly alone in all of this no one can take it away for me and who knows what the doctor will say tomorrow 

Where do I go from here , only way is forward but it’s so hard right now. 
People I love used to call me their sunshine I’m afraid I no longer am and it’s sad 

Sorry for the rant , I’m not sure what I’m doing here",14May2020,1
239,"I’ve tried to tell my parents about my mental health before, but it never goes as planned. I don’t reveal everything (ex: self harm/suicidal thoughts for obvious reasons) but I tell them enough so they should know its serious. The first time I had a conversation they told me that they’ve been depressed before and I should just go outside and clean my room. The second time I got them to consider therapy, but with quarantine it’s not happening. I tried bringing up therapy again and they suggested I talk to the school counselor over email (which I’m not comfortable with). I’m in a really bad place mentally right now and I don’t think I can fix it without help. I just don’t know how to convince my parents. I feel too embarrassed to ask again. I’ve pushed away a lot of my friends so I don’t even know if I can talk to them.",14May2020,1
240,"i dont know where to post this i literally feel like im in a coma or a dream nothing feels real to me at all not even because of the virus, ive felt like this for months and months and i hear birds in my ears and i try to record it but you cant hear it in the recording  and i hear people talking sometimes  but not to me and theres always a staticky noise and i always see shapes but ive been seeing them for years theyre just random coloured shapes floating and theyre like really faded i can barely see them but anyway everything is just so weird and off i cant stop feeling like im in a coma i can even hear the birds now maybe its just stuff im hearing from the hospital room 
i probably definitely sound insane thats why im posting it here but i literally just want to wake up i physically cannot make myself believe this is reality anymore nothing feels real and there are glitches too and so much more stuff and none of it adds up",14May2020,3
241,"I feel like I try too hard to the point where it seems suspicious. For example, I had old benzos laying around from before and I brought them to her to show her that there were more than half of the amount left and I insisted she keep time dispose of them.

She was going to prescribe me an anti depressant that I had already been on, so I was going to send her pictures of the old bottle since I still had the bottle and I worried that she wouldn't believe me even though she said she did. 

And when our appointments are over, I wonder if I explained what I was trying to say or if it came out the wrong way so I get the urge to call to explain it better. 

What is this? Is this submissive behavior? Am I a push over? Is that why I'm the way I am
Or am I paranoid?",14May2020,1
242,"Atm im having a breakdown. I had a horrible week a lot of health anxiety, and very sad and the feeling of wanting to go home ( I expiernce this a lot) i feel things very strong, and that can be a lot for people, i do like talking to someone whenever i feel bad or upset. I was alone for years i dont want that feeling i just want comfort while being upset. I have a very loving partner, i always tell him whenever i feel upset because i trust him a lot. Lately i have been feeling the vibe that i am too much for him. Which is a horrible feeling, i just got off a phone call with him. I lied for the first time. I softly cried 30 min on the phone without him knowing while talking about my strong emotions and about this week. I lied about not crying, feeling good and about it all being okay. It felt horrible i got off the phone with him 20 min ago and i havent cried this hard in a while. I dont know what to do. I didnt want to make him feel bad or put my emotions on him. I hate this",14May2020,1

244,"My psychiatrist, also certified as my psychotherapist, whom I have been working with 5+ years- initially diagnosed me with Major Depressive disorder, Generalized Anxiety disorder, schizoaffective (but withdrew this diagnosis later) and now diagnosed as “on the spectrum” of bipolar. I have done some research but I’m not sure of the difference (if there is a difference) between “on the spectrum bipolar” and Bipolar-NOS. I have succeeded in putting major lifelong clinical depression (or perhaps an extreme depressive state mixed with rare occasional hypomania) into remission, still struggling with mixed states, an occasional but rare depressive state, hypomania, anxiety, insomnia.

I was extremely suicidal and depressed for 100% of my adolescent and adult life (until it went into remission less than a year ago).

However, I am not sure where to even begin with being “bipolar on the spectrum.” All my energy used to be spent on not committing suicide, which I have reasonably, personally, objectively put into remission for now, for the first time in my entire life. I can feel a totally different shift, slowly but surely, an awakening within the depths of my soul- that wishes to live and thrive, rather than die.

Now my previous suicidal energy is being freed up to focus on the bipolar spectrum. I am aware people with bipolar can also feel suicidal- but for me personally after years of professional help, immediate suicidal tendencies/plans and suicidal ideation have been put into remission.

I gather that people on the “bipolar spectrum” experience bipolar effects in a multitude of different ways- after all, each brain is unique.

I am simply hoping for viewpoints, personal anecdotes, feedback etc. from those diagnosed with “on the spectrum” bipolar- although I welcome comments from everyone who is bipolar, regardless of specific type.

Sometimes, it’s also hard for me to differentiate hypomania/manic states, depressive states, and mixed states vs. a “neurotypical” emotion. I have been unable to trust or rely on my mind for so long that I cannot easily differentiate emotions from a mental disorder. 

For context, I have also received CBT and DBT therapy, group therapy (for general mental health, EA, trauma, grief and loss), residential treatment, partial hospitalization, and completed an intensive outpatient program. I also meditate and read books on healing/recovery). 

I have been on various medications, and after the usual trial-and-error, found ones that worked for me- but no longer fit me. I am now on Lamictal (for almost 5 months), after titrating up/down to finally 150 mg, which I begin taking tonight. 

My doctor has now prescribed Doxeprine for sleep (Ambien does not work for me) and Clonazepam for daytime anxiety. I used to be prescribed Alprazolam for occasional panic attacks but my generalized anxiety still impairs my ability to function daily- so we are switching to a longer-lasting medication. I have been on Clonazepam previously (under a different psychiatrist) and experienced little side effects.

Please also feel free to share, if comfortable, which medications have worked for you.

I feel stretched very thin and would really love to hear from those who can also relate.

I’m sorry for this long post; I have written it during a mandated shelter-in-place order where I reside, due to a global pandemic; I have not had much interaction with others lately. I am also generally unable to disclose this information to others irl because I do not feel safe nor comfortable to do so.

Thank you.",14May2020,1
245,"I know im scitzo-afective. And had intense mood swings growing up. But now its just kinda depressed, to the point of turning down the suicide offers in my head. Ill get angry for a few hours or really anxious and get paranoid. Then its all panic attack with visual and audio halucinations. But this is down to 1 or 2 every too weeks with medication. Along with that they have me doped up on mood stabilizers, which makes my mind cloudy and can only feel depressed or numb. All i think about is philosophy about the after life. Ill get stuck in a thought and not do anything but think till i hallucinate whatever ideas i come up with. I cant go to the pscych during the current situation. So im asking if anyone can explain things to me a little.
Edit-
I have feelings of nonexistence and am always fearful that this is a fabricated reality. And i fight hard not to take nonprescription drugs. Its hard because i just wanna feel less like the crippled man i am. Or just to feel anything besides my very thin section of emotions. Happiness isnt the same as it used to be. Its so dull and short. I cant really get too angry without my brain turning against me. Im normally bored and numb or depresses and hiding behind a talkative facade. Any ideas to summarize this stuff for my next psych visit would be great as well",14May2020,1
246,"She has in the past said things like ""you can be really difficult"", and makes me feel like things are my fault. Like when my stepdad lied saying there was an FBI investigation on me after i smoked some weed, which isn't okay for a parent to do that lol, she said ""im not saying i agree with him, but i can see why he did it, you were smoking weed in the woods"" so... legit take out the ""im not saying i agree with him"" and u legit have her agreeing with him? Now my suspicions are that she wants me to not move out, so she makes me feel crazy, like I just am paranoid or something, which I feel like is an intense thing to believe about your 16 yr old daughter, i mean idk but still. Like I get i shouldnt have smoked the weed but still, i dont think yelling at me then saying ""me yelling is your fault, if only you didnt smoke weed"" is really gonna help the case. and she compares me to my delusional dad a lot, and has been told not to by my psychologist, but then she goes ""im not comparing you to your dad, but when your dad smoked weed it messed him up and caused him many problems"", but again take out the word play of ""im not comparing you to your dad"" and she's fr comparing him to me. now more situations like this have occurred without weed being involved but recently ive just had weed and im tryna use it up so i just bumped into them a couple times while doing it, so im not a frequent user and this isnt something that has been going on for a long time, but the way she speaks to me has been going on for a long time. i fr think she wants me to believe im paranoid and crazy so i dont move out, and another thought is if i rlly am crazy..?",14May2020,1
247,"I'm at home with my parents (it's my first year of college). Every one of my screwups is treated as emblematic of my character according to my mother. She sees every time I mess up as an opportunity to tear into me and minimize me for making human mistakes. My dad is just annoying and doesn't know when to shut the fuck up. Over the years I've dealt with such bullshit from both of them that it's completely eliminated any chance of me ever loving or caring for either of them.

I sincerely hope they both die of the virus. Hell, I'll catch it myself and then bring it back to those two dumb cunts if I have to. Fuck them. Fuck my family. I want all of them dead. This isn't just quarantine talking; I've been wanting them all dead since I was 12. I genuinely hate this family, and I think it's unfair that I was adopted into such a shitty place when I could've been aborted instead or left to die somewhere.

But this is just my life. I get stuck with every disadvantage that makes it hard to live life, and the universe just likes screwing me over.",14May2020,1

249,"I have been struggling with this problem for almost a year now and it keeps coming back now and then. 

I often get thoughts of ending myself or thoughts that potentially harm me. It upsets me because I don’t want to end my life :(. I always fear that I might die of suicide yet I don’t have intentions. 

It just upsets me as to why I have these thoughts and feel so scared and confused.

My life isn’t as terrible as it is though my family is a pain is the butt. I have a sweet boyfriend and a caring best friend and an education yet for some reason I have visions of my death or thoughts that come by and disturb me.

I just ask myself how long are these thought going to last. Why am I getting these thoughts. Is there something missing in my life or is there purpose far beyond me.",14May2020,3
250,"I got diagnosed with anxiety and OCD 2 months ago and currently on medication for 1 month. But I feel more anxious now because I am doubting every thought in my head and obsessing over not obsessing on anything. 

I feel like before this while I felt broken on the inside I can at least keep it together on the outside. Now I feel sad and exhausted and I’ve cried to my parents for comfort for the first time in my life. I feel like shit.

Is it supposed to feel this bad?",14May2020,1
