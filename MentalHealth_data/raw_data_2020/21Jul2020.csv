1,"I don’t know what to do. (Hopefully somebody can give me a piece of advice?)I have a very introverted personality I don’t like revealing my feelings especially when they’re toxic and ugly like feelings of insecurity, self hate or self worthlessness and anxiety. Whenever my bf’s and I’s friends want to hangout I get a huge wave anxiety and dread, but I can play online with friends just fine. They’re fun and all, but for me having people over is draining at least for me. My bf is the opposite and loves having his friends over, and I spiral in my own head during or after hangouts in my own head about thoughts of how everyone is better than me or how I’m annoying or my bf likes talking or looking at them rather than me because I’m so shitty or ugly etc. My bf says he’s always going to want to have people over and I said I’ll just deal with it and be apart of group. My bf is very loving and supportive and it sucks that I can’t just be built that way, to love having people over all the time and not feel drained or have negative feelings/thoughts. I wish I was brave enough to end it and not be a burden, but I’m a coward and I’d probably be causing more pain. It’s hard accepting the fact that I might need to talk to a therapist and on personal biases I don’t think it would work for me, but if anyone has had therapy for similar reasons I would love to hear if it worked for you, it would give me some courage or hope to talk to someone. I just feel ashamed to think that something’s wrong with me and others will know that and realize I’m just a black hole with nothing to offer.",21Jul2020,1

6,"my uni offers a therapist free of charge for mental health services. and I had a therapist for a while but just recently he’s been on leave. Like he hasn’t been able to talk to me for four weeks and I really want to talk to him bc i usually do weekly sessions with him. 

some lady called me this morning telling my appointment was canceled for the fourth time and said that I could either refer to emergency services or wait until my therapist comes back. And I asked her what it means for something to be a “emergency quote and she was like if you just need to talk someone after hours they’ll be that person for you. But I feel kind of weird using an emergency hotline if it’s just for me to talk about my feelings. Like I feel like an emergency hotline would be like for suicide word something severe.

I just really want to talk to someone and I really have no one to talk to you when I feel alone a lot and I get a lot of anxiety from just overthinking everything. I don’t know if I should call the emergency hotline tonight in case I overthink too much.",21Jul2020,2

8,"I’ve been in a pretty bad place mentally for about a year, and over this past year I’ve noticed myself never being sure about anything regarding myself. Things like I’m not sure what I wanna do, I’m not sure why I feel certain ways, etc. I’ve started to reach a point where I’m not even sure “who I am”. In the sense of, I’m not sure what I’d define my personality as, I’m not sure what my goals and values are anymore, I’m not sure what I want to do in life. I don’t know what’s happening anymore, and every time I think about it I tend to freak out. Any time I have any sort of memory that triggers me emotionally (sad memories), I immediately disassociate and space out, often staring blankly just lost in thought till I remember that I’m doing sometime, which could be anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes. What should I do? Where should I start? And what could this be?",21Jul2020,1
9,"I am a parent who's struggled with self-harm since I was 12 years old. I'm almost 34 now, and have an amazingly sweet 10 year old son. I've had my periods of ""sobriety.""

Its not perfect, and I've been struggling a lot lately. Now that my kid is older he wants to know about my scars. How magically 2 bright pink lines (scars not fresh cuts) appeared on mom's arm during the span of a 2 week period? I tried to hide it, but its too hot for long sleeves forever...

What the hell am I supposed to say? I am neurotically concerned that if I tell the truth it will somehow influence him and steer him towards cutting as a coping skill as he gets older.

14,"Recently I've been having trouble sleeping, I often find it hard to relax and drift of to sleep but every time I do so I violently wake up in a state of gasping for air, I believe I'm breathing fine when I'm dozing, however I sudden wake up it feels like I haven't took a breath in a solid minute. 

As of from two days ago it has effected me more than usual I don't  know if it's stress due to what's happening in my life, (not related to COVID-19) but I often find myself aggressively waking up and sitting up, first time this happened I was very confused and I just shock it off like it was nothing, but now it's happening at least 3-5 times a night and I haven't gotten a good nights rest in god knows how long.

When this tends to happen I feel like my body just refuses to breath but I'm not sure if I'm breathing or not it's starting to scare me now, 

last time it happened I scared the shit out my dog when I rose up from the same type of incident but the sound I made... it terrified me the most, it's as if I've been underwater for a solid 3 mins without a breathing tank... 

I haven't talked to my dad about this but my relationship isn't so good rn, considering how much shit has gone down I'm not sure how I should explain this to him nor do I know if he's understand, knowing him he'll prob just tell me to shake it off.

Please if anyone understands where I'm coming from, I would very much like to hear your opinion.",21Jul2020,2
15,"  

When something negative happens, I am unable to stop hyper-focusing on the issue until I can resolve it. It is starting to impede my life and has caused me to fall behind in schoolwork and has led me to question friendships or be disgusted by them. I feel so overwhelmed because for the most part I am a happy person but the last month I have been experiencing intense mood swings. 

I experienced emotional and some physical abuse growing up from a narcissistic mother. I also experienced emotional abuse and gaslighting in a previous relationship with an ex. Both were/are compulsive liars. Recently I moved out of the country and since going no-contact with my family, I am the happiest I have been. I really have tried to focus on building a close community of friends who are positive and it has really helped my mental health. My current boyfriend, who has been supportive and patient with my trust issues lied to be about something small about a friend( context-wise it had nothing to do with our relationship, I was upset because when I asked him about the situation he directly lied to me). I am disgusted by him because of the lie. This is the first small lie I’ve caught him, but when we first started speaking he had lied about his body count (by a fuck ton ayee). This was something I eventually got over because we did talk it out and he explained to me that he was in a poor mental place in his life and I am not exaggerating when I say that he goes out of his way for me to be happy. 

I feel guilty that I am so angry and revolted by him for a white lie. I also feel angry enough to still want to leave the relationship. This isn’t the first time I have reacted in this way, I felt like I had a few new friends try to manipulate and use me and I ended up just cutting off the relationship, granted I don’t feel completely bad or off base regarding one. But I do know this isn’t a normal response. I need help letting things go so I can focus and keep my life on track.",21Jul2020,7
16,"Sometimes I feel like i don't have bipolar, I AM bipolar. Often times I feel like I let it wreck havok on my life. My paranoia causes my to act aloof and mean  to people around me. I always have this low level paranoia, where although I love my friends, there's this feeling of ""everyone is out to get you"" and level of paranoia. Sometimes I'll catch myself being a little rude/aggressive for no reason, to strangers as well. No matter what I try, what medicine I take, the paranoia is always there.
I have an aunt that has paranoid schizophrenia, and I saw what she become. She one hurt my grandmother after not taking her meds and an episode of paranoia. I always feel rather on edge with her she's always borderline hostile with everyone. Sometimes I recognize myself in her. I'm so afraid that one day, I'll be so angry and paranoid that I won't have anyone left to love me. And I wouldn't blame them or get mad. No matter how much I need friends, their health comes first.
I hope someday this parsnoia will go away. Until then, I always ask my little brother form a scale of 1-10 how much of a dick I'm acting, because I can't tell if I'm being mean anymore. I feel like instead of saying I have bipolar, I am bipolar. And my mental health had wrecked havok on my life. I don't want to push a victim mentality, but I really can't control it. I'm angry that it seems like an unmovable rock that I will never, ever push over. I'm scared for myself. I'm scared to go to college because I'm afraid I might be aggressive or irritated to people around me. I won't be able to have group projects, or be in a work like setting or anything.

I'm so scared for myself and my future. That's why I have low esteem and I'm constantly over apologizing because I feel like I'm a burden to others. I feel as life I'm a ticking time bomb. That's why I don't even consider going to college, because what's the point of I'm not going to live that long anyway. I don't have to plan for retirement, since my death age will probably be less than 50.
I just feels s if it's a death sentence for me. I'm either feeling drugged and my mind is empty, of manic and severely angry at everything. I just want to have a ""normal"" mind for just a few minutes. Some type of normalcy. 
I'm moving in with a couple of friends in about 2 months and I'm afraid to love it because what if I showed that aggression to my friends? After about maybe month of living together, my other side will show and they'll keep me at arm's length.

I just really wish there was a quick solution to all this. I don't just have regular manic/depressive symptoms. I have a heap of paranoia, aggression, and minor rage all in one.

I haven't hurt anyone close to me, but I feel like one day I just will. I've been started medicine about a year ago, and I feel as if my paranoia has only gotten worse from here. I can feel it every single day, and I'm afraid it's just going to become worse.

I can't even feel joy or passion about things I sued to do. Call it ""flat effect"" or whatever, but I'm not able to look at things and feel warmth. When I look at my dog I've raised for a year, I don't feel any type of fondness. Not when I look at my boyfriend, or my friends. I can just feel a lack of giving a fuck about everything what's the purpose to life if you can't even feel pleasure?

I have an appointment in a couple of days, so I hope we'll start on some kind of treatment, but it just seems like there isn't any. 
 That's why I feel as if I am bipolar, and that's my only redeeming trait. I try to remind myself that I'm a good person, but I just feel the opposite. As if I have this facade of being a good person, but I'm just a paranoid bitch underneath. And it's going to take a while for it to come out.
If you made it to the end of this rant, congratulations. In conclusion, I'm a hot mess.",21Jul2020,1

22,"I have a partner who I love so much and has been in my life for 3 years. They took LSD last month (we have both taken LSD before but they did this alone) and tripped by themselves off a gel tab, which he later found out was equal to about 3 tabs of acid. 
He had a really bad trip, and described being possessed at one point and even thinking he was dying outside in the woods. 
Anyway about 2-3 weeks later we smoked some weed together, and things got weird... before this he was pretty fine. But I think the weed triggered something. He started doing really weird hand gestures and claiming he has a spirit in him and knows so much universal knowledge. He asks himself questions and gets strange answers.. he said he feels a *magnetic* pull in his body to do certain things. Sometimes he speaks in a Jamaican accent to himself and says that’s the spirit he’s channeling who’s his soul grandfather.. i don’t know.. anyway. He came back to reality for a little last night and we talked about psychosis/schizophrenia and he listened openly about it and agreed. And he wants help. Anyway... coming in the morning now is the worst I’ve seen him. I rarely slept last night because he was beginning for me to listen to his rambling because he really felt like if I didn’t listen he was going to die. so I listened. Every time I would try and close my eyes he would cringe in pain so hard and beg me to listen more, and ask for me to heal him and say that I just need to keep telling him good things... whenever I left the bedroom last night he wanted to follow me everywhere because he said it made him feel safer. 
Anyway now 6AM I have work he was begging me to not to go, he’s told me that there’s so much chatter in his head and it’s just so negative. Then he expressed the voices want him to die, and want him to kill himself, and he believes he’s gonna die. And I told him it’s not true and he’s gonna be okay. He also told me that the spirits were telling him I will never understand and that he really is possessed and I will never know.. I tried to walk him to the hospital this morning but he was really delusional this morning and was running down the streets yelling and dancing and singing. 
I had to call the police so they could help transport him, by the time they came he calmed down and he agreed to let me help him and said thank you..
So now he’s at the hospital. Which I’m so worried about the treatment he’ll be getting there since I live in the city and it has such bad reviews.. anyway my heart is in so much pain right now. This person is so important to me... and I’m so heartbroken not knowing what’s going to happen. He doesn’t have any family or anywhere to really go and I really do want to take care of him when he gets out but also I know that’s a huge responsibility that I may not be equipped enough to handle. 
Anyway... I guess I’m just asking for any kind words, advice, insight on this situation... and maybe to know if there’s a possibility that he will recover and come back to earth.... :/",21Jul2020,3

I just tried to tell a friend about it and no one seems to take me seriously because I look healthy.

If I would wake up tomorrow and feel somewhat fucking normal, I'd go out and get a job and fucking get my life together, but everyday I wake up and I feel tired as shit.

I don't know if I have chronic fatigue, some undiagnosed illness or maybe I'm just mentally unstable. I really don't fucking know what's wrong with me.

Most of the people I used to hang out with probably think I'm a loser because I spend 95% of my time sitting at home doing nothing because I physically feel like shit everyday. not once did anyone take me seriously and tried to understand.

31,"Hi everyone, thanks for reading. 
I’m 25F, currently on Wellbutrin 300mg and have been for 2 years. Depression/anxiety/CPTSD- all professionally diagnosed. 

The last 2 weeks I have been in a downward spiral. What started as some increased anxiety and some minor panic attacks, has spiraled into some kind of nightmare anxiety episode. 

As of this moment, I haven’t slept in 40 hours, and sleep in days before was restless and full of nightmares. I can’t fall asleep because I’m too anxious about it (for no reason). I have TMJ and my jaw is so tight, I literally can’t chew and i have headaches that won’t go away. I keep periodically vomiting and having dizzy spells. These are all typical manifestations of my anxiety, just not this bad or all at once. 

I sob nearly constantly, sometimes because of something sad, sometimes because of something cute, sometimes for no reason at all. My negative thoughts are out of control, all I can think about is how much I hate myself and my life, to the point where I find it hard to listen to other people when they are speaking. I also keep disassociating and losing hours of my day. 

I do have a therapist (not a psychiatrist) I have talked to her about this but she doesn’t seem that concerned. My medication was prescribed by my PCP. 

At this moment, it could be a lack of sleep but I feel like something is horribly, horribly wrong with me. I feel like I’m dying. I’m so scared that something bad is happening to me and that it won’t go away or that I will hurt myself or even others, unintentionally, like I will enter some state where I’m unaware of my actions. But also, even typing that seems like a crazy idea! 

If anyone has any tips or suggestions for how to make this stop, what I should do, support or encouragement, I will take anything. I don’t know how to make this stop.",21Jul2020,1

36,"First of all I'm sorry if it's badly written, I'm not really good at this and probably forgot a lot of stuff. But I need advice and I also wanted to share my story.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------
Let me start off by saying the first years of all this happening are vague memories. I don't remember everything as clearly as I used to.

I have never really done this before but I would like to share my story. It all started approximately 12 years ago. First class of high school is when all of the ""trouble"" started, I remember I had a very good and fun time. I did good in school, had a lot of friends, friends that I hung out with outside of school. So basically the entirety of my first year in high school was great. But then, at around the end of the first class. I all of a sudden started hearing voices in my head. I was 12, it was scary, weird and it felt very unreal yet also VERY real. I didn't know what to do with it, I was scared to tell my friends and my parents. It was 4 different voices, all male voices. They told me to do stuff. Thing as, don't pay attention in class, don't do your homework, be mean to your sister, ignore your friends etc. I'd say they were basically just bullying me the whole time. I was very young and I didn't know what to do with it so I listened. There were times where I tried not to listen and just ignore what the voices said to me or told me to do. When I did that, they would scream and bother me all day long. Imagine being at a party with 10 people and you're all talking to each other, they would scream, insult me, talk gibberish for hours and hours. Eventually I started doing worse in school because I wasn't paying attention (it was also hard because the voice would bother me every single day in school) I think my friends from back then started noticing things too and they eventually told my parents about it. I think I've said some weird shit to them that made them even more worried. I don't remember much about what happened after that, it's all very vague.

Next year high school, things just got worse and worse. Contact with my previous friends was gone because I never showed up to anything. Always said no, undoubtedly said weird shit that probably scared them off. Now I think about it I think it was maybe some kind of coping way. I never did my homework, I never learned for tests nor did I pay attention in lessons. Half a year in second year, the people at school told me it wasn't looking so good, that I wouldn't pass it to the next year if I didn't start putting in some work. Well, there was no way that was happening so I went to a different school. Lower level is the best way I can word it I think. It was a shame but there wasn't anything I could do about it. I spend the next 3 years there, things kept getting worse and worse. I missed A LOT in school because of the voices. I also missed a lot because I had awful stomach ache, now I think about it, it most likely is all because of the voices, stress and anxiety. After the first year of high school I basically lost all of the friends I had. The next 3 years I just went to school, not having friends and not talking to anyone really. When I went home I hopped on the PC and just played games until I went to sleep. I got kinda addicted to gaming because that's all I really did, just sitting in my room 24/7 and going to school every now and then. Voices in my head kept getting worse day by day, they started telling me different stuff. Told me to not go to school, to hurt myself, to kill myself, jump in front of a train. I tried to ignore most of it by playing games all day and listening to music, it helped a lot but later on voices just kept getting stronger and they managed to get through everything I did. I eventually started to self-harm, that just started off small and not very often. Took a razor blade apart and start self-harming on my upper arm. It was just a way of coping with all the stuff in my head. It helped, temporarily.. it was also very addicting.. 

Last year of high school, showed up even less in school. I'm still flabbergasted that I managed to pass all the exams. Self-harming got worse, happened at least once a week. I had a lot of anxiety, social anxiety also. I barely slept because of the anxiety, I had awful nightmares so I just played games until I was too tired I just passed out. I still had zero friends, the people I used to be in class with all chose different directions than me. 

After high school I went the study Desktop Publishing (end of 2014). None of the people from my last class did that so I had to go alone with no one I knew. It was also in a different city which scared the fuck out of me, my anxiety was off the roof every time I had to go with the bus. It always felt like people were looking weirdly at me, but that's just because the voices told me that. They just drilled stuff into my head and eventually you're just going to start believing everything they say. I actually had a really good time there, made some friends in the same class as me whom I played games with in the evening. But the voices, the anxiety, the self-harm. One day at home my sister saw my wounds on my arm and told my parents about it, I don't really remember what we talked about exactly but I had to talk to someone at school about it, she was working in the mental health industry. So that's what I did the next day at school, after that things moved FAST. I had to go to a mental health clinic because I was a danger to myself, it made sense because I had a lot of suicidal thoughts. I still have them to this day. I was 15 or 16 I think, I didn't want to because it would mean moving away from my parents and my sister, it would mean I could not play games anymore which was an escape for me but I guess I had to face it if I wanted to get better. So yeah, I moved to a clinic. There were different groups in the clinic, one of them was a closed group with children that were a harm to themselves. So that's where I had to go the first 2 weeks, it was kinda awful and very boring because well you can guess it. There wasn't anything to do, you weren't allowed to do anything except just sitting there in the living room or your own room which only had a bed and a desk. Now I've seen some stupid fucking shit over there, children getting thrown in a isolation room because they weren't listening or they were hitting the people that worked there. Now in now way do I think that was ever right to just throw them in an isolation room, like what the fuck is that going to do to them. NOTHING. It made me mad, sad and there wasn't anything I could do about it. It happened to me a few times, still don't know why. Anyway, I moved to a different group 2/3 weeks later, there were only girls there which was kinda awkward but it was nice. Everyone there was there for a reason so it was very nice to talk to some of them about our problems, I made friends there which was nice. All of us had to do stuff, we all had different schedules. We went in pairs to get groceries and then another pair had to cook, dishes etc. I was nice but it also was scary because I hated doing groceries but I didn't have to do it alone which helped a lot. We had different group therapy sessions and honestly, they didn't do shit. 

I've talked to a lot of different psychiatrists and psychologists the time I was there, about the voices, about what they said, about my nightmares. Now I'm gonna be really honest, I still have help to this day. And honestly, nothing in the past 7 years has helped me. Anyway, they mentioned schizophrenia quite often. So eventually the started prescribing me medication, that just started off with anti-depressants. And god just medication overall is fucking awful, first 2 weeks on being on you're just feeling worse because of the side effects, then you have to build it up. With anti-depressants it usually took between 4-6 weeks before you could even notice anything. Then you have to take that shit for a while and if you don't notice anything you gotta cut it down slowly and all of that just takes a long time. I don't really feel like talking more about the clinic because it hasn't really done much for me. I was there for about 6 months and then I went home again, to be honest. Nothing really changed, I just went back to gaming. I did have a lot of online friends that I would talk to everyday, I would also skype with them very often. When I was back home I started doing some voluntary work which was nice in a way but it didn't really do anything with the voices nor the anxiety or nightmares, I guess the social anxiety got a bit better because I wasn't that scared to go outside anymore. I still had appointments every week over at the clinic with psychiatrists and psychologists, tried a lot of different medication and different therapies. Eventually they discharged me there and redirected me to a different team that specialized in people with psychiatric disorders. In a way I was glad because it meant they maybe knew a bit more of what was going on with me. Again I had appointments every week, usually just about medication. I started with anti-psychotic medication, which was honestly way way worse then just anti-depressants. Side effects where worse, it was basically the same old story just worse. But I had hope, I had hope there would be one that would MAYBE help me a tiny bit in dealing with the voices. But no, there wasn't. I've tried almost all of them and ended up using the one they prescribe when all of the others don't do anything. And boy, that one was the worst of them all. The side effects didn't go away until I stopped using it, they had to test my blood every week because things could happen if I didn't. No idea what, couldn't really care at that point. Well eventually they also discharged ( mid 2013 ) me there because they said the problems I was showing and talking about were not a psychiatric-disorder. I was relieved in a way? But I also lost all of the hope that I had, I had tried so many different medication, talked to tons of different people and nothing helped. 

In 2015 my parents decided it was better for me, and for them for me to move out. Which initially I didn't agree with but it was indeed the right choice. It was too hard on my mom because she would hear me at night very often and she would know I wasn't doing good. So I went to live in an assisted facility, which sucked a lot because I didn't need any of the help. But it was the only thing available in my hometown. This was around mid 2015, I also went to a different team again back then, to get more help. I still have appointments every week. I did try some new medication that I hadn't tried yet just to see if it would change anything, it had been a few years since a had medication. Unfortunately nothing really helped until I stumbled across alprazolam, most of you guys will know it as Xanax. It's absolute garbage, but it helped me. I took it every now and then when I was feeling really scared or had bad nightmares. In a way I was glad I had new help again because it gave me a tiny bit of hope to hopefully get better, or how to deal with the voices and all the things that came with it.
I had a lot of different therapies once again, on how to deal with the voices, how to get more confidence, how to deal with anxiety etc. None of it really did anything. I'll talk more about this in a little bit. I had a friend from primary school that I saw every now and then, besides that I really didn't see anyone. I still did the voluntary work at a cat shelter which was a lot of fun. But all those years of medication, talking to people, trying different therapies. Did not do anything. It made me lose more hope each and every day. I just played games, talked to my online friends and eventually I fell in love with a girl all the way in Germany. It was weird because I never thought I could fall in love with someone over the internet, someone that I had not seen in real life ever. Only via skype. But I guess it is possible, and it was great. I felt great, there were times where I even felt happy ( I think ? ) She visited me 2 times a month and I visited her too. Visiting here was probably the scariest thing I had ever done, I had never been on a train and I had to go all the way to Germany, boy was I proud of myself when I got there. All in all, I had a good time but it just wasn't it for me so after about a year I ended things. And that was it, back the being alone in my room. I did move to a different apartment which was nice, more privacy, bigger, just everything you need really. 

The friend I talked about sometimes asked me if I wanted to come with him to the pub in the weekends, I wasn't really a big fan of seeing people let alone a bunch of people in the same place. But I did say yes almost every time. One time I saw a friend from primary school that I had not seen in about 5 years. We started talking to catch up with each other, we started become good friends again and hung out with each other very often. Fast forward, mid 2016 I think. Pokémon GO got released, him and me were always big fans of Pokémon, we used to always play it on the gameboy when we were little kids. We started playing it, this was the first time in years that I went outside every single day just to play this game with him and a ton of other guys that were his friends. They all knew my name, they all knew who I was but they had never really seen me. All because they know my sister. Mid 2016 was the first time in fucking years I had friends, like actual friends that cared about me even though half of the time I didn't believe it because of what the voices are always saying to me. I still kept in touch with the people I gamed with but things did change, I gamed less and was more outside. I went to the pub almost every weekend with a bunch of them. I had one other friend that lived in Sweden, honestly, my best friend. He knew everything and was always there for me. We talked almost every day and played games together. One saturday in the pub I got a follow request on instagram from a random girl all the way from Canada, we started talking and eventually skyping and once again I fell in love with someone over the internet, to me that shit is still fucking stupid but I guess you can't stop feelings, if they're even real feelings. It was also probably the biggest mistake, because the entire time we talked (about a year) she emotionally abused me. I was in love so I didn't really see it, I did everything she asked and shut out a lot of people for her, for some random girl over the internet. She destroyed my self-confidence and my trust in people too. I eventually realized it was very toxic and that she was destroying me so I blocked her and deleted her off of every single social media. But there I was, back in a hole. Being depressed once again. My friend had a girlfriend at the same time, that relationship stopped earlier. I was always interested in her when I saw her at parties or when we were at the pub. He didn't treat her well and that was something I noticed every time. Then one time in the pub ( mid 2017 ) I saw her sitting there, and god was she looking beautiful. I instantly fell in love and started talking to her, and she felt the exact same way. I think that was actually the first time in my life that I felt real happiness. We started dating, it made me so fucking happy. It motivated me to get better. We had an amazing time together, when I was her I was feeling good. When I was not with her, it was just the same as always, depressed, voices making me sad, scared. It was very hard for her because I wasn't always doing good when were were together, there were times where I just felt like shit and I didn't really want talk or to get touched. I never liked it either when my mom or dad tried to give me a hug. They always suspected something happened when I was younger, I never really thought about it that way. But one day I had therapy, my therapist started talking about stuff that can happen to anyone, like being in in accident, earthquakes, fights, and sexual abuse/rape. When she said that last thing, I froze, and all of a sudden I saw and remembered stuff. That was the trigger, people had asked me about that stuff before, very often. But somehow this time it was different, it triggered something. It was buried so deep that I just forget about it, so it turns out that when I was 11/12 I don't know the exact year, I got raped. Which explained so much, it explained why I often at times didn't want to get touched by my girlfriend at the time, or be intimate. 

It all didn't even bother me that much, mostly because I only saw small parts of what happened. And it wasn't like I thought about it very often after that, so my therapist told me we could try EMDR, which I had tried before for nightmares. But it wasn't really necessary because I didn't really think about it at all to be honest. But what happened when I was younger, is the cause of everything that has happened. I was too afraid to tell anyone about it, and that makes sense because when you're 11/12 you don't even know what the fuck just happened to you, whether it is even wrong or right. So I guess I buried it away. My girlfriend was very supportive, I mean she has always been there for me and has done everything me. Literally the sweetest girl I have ever met. But it's weird because I didn't think about what happened, I didn't have any flashbacks, nothing triggered it anymore. So I guess unknowingly it was still bothering me a lot. A few months after I found what happened, there was a night where I just felt really really bad, it happened often and I usually just took a xanax and hurt myself. That was my way of coping. But it was different that time, the voices they were different. It hit me more, I got scared, I panicked. I took all the xanax and cut myself way deeper than I usually did. I ended up in the hospital because I took too many medication. It wasn't even to kill myself though I've had suicidal thoughts for years, it was just to get the voices away so I could feel calm in my head. That happened a few more times after that with months in between. And I still can't imagine how hard that must have been for my close friends, my girlfriend and my family. I didn't really talk about stuff with my friends or my girlfriend, I usually just pushed it away because I always think I bother people with it. I think deep inside I know I don't bother them with it, but it's the voices that have buried that inside of me. We've dated for about 2 and a half year. This year in February she broke up with me, not necessarily because the feelings were gone. It was just too hard for her, and I completely understand that. I can't deal with it because I need someone with me, it keeps me motivated, it keeps me thriving to get better. Right now it feels like I'm doing it for no one, I always did it more for her than for myself. That's just who I am. I still had hope that we could work it out one way or another. I just had to work on myself and show it, show that I could do this alone. I tried to not contact her, but that was too hard so I kept messaging her. She didn't really reply because she needed time to process it all and she also just wanted to work on herself. It's hard, really hard. Eventually I managed to not really message her, just every now and then a message. But I was very depressed, very sad and very suicidal. All of that I had before, but not like this ever. I talked about it with friends, I talked about it with her girlfriends which helped me more because they knew her really good as well and it is just different talking to a girl about that stuff than a guy. After a while they didn't really like talking about it anymore because they were close to her and close to me, which I understood so I stopped doing that. March 2020, the only person I really talked about it with was Viktor, my best from Sweden. He came to visit me last year and met some of my IRL friends we usually played games with. He always has been the one I went to with my problems, he had known me the longest. There were lots of times where we didn't talk for weeks and then there were times where we talked every single day. 

March 20 at around 9:58 PM I get a message on discord, Viktor wanted me to call him. It was a message I only saw the next day. He told me he was panicking, I told him I was sorry I didn't see the message and asked him what was up. He didn't reply the entire week, at first I didn't really think much about it because we didn't always speak you know, there were weeks where we didn't spoke at all. But the on Sunday I started worrying, I thought something bad has happened. So I messaged some of his IRL friends asking them if they had hear from Viktor. One of them told me he died the night of March 20. He took LSD and had a bad trip and eventually killed himself, I was the last person he sent a message to, in fact the last person he even spoke to. And I missed the message he sent me. I know I shouldn't think like this but I fucking wish I saw it so I could've called him and maybe, just maybe talk to him and try to calm him down. I lost my best friend, and I lost the girl that I wanted to be with for the rest of my life (how corny huh). All of this in a period of 3 months. I don't know how to cope, I still have not dealt with the death of my best friends since the only fucking thing I can think about is my ex. I still can't sleep because of it, I still barely eat. A few weeks after I got the news there was one night where things just broke, I broke, I went full on panic mode. This was it for me, I was planning on killing myself, so I took all my xanax, all my anti-depressants and a fuck ton of paracetamol and lots of alcohol. After that I started to hurt myself, tried to slice my throat. When I did all of that, I panicked which I guess means I might want to live after all? Called my friend, had to go to the hospital and had to stay there overnight. After all of that had happened, I thought about just messaging my ex if she wanted to smoke and just talk about random stuff. We did that quite a few times, obviously it felt very different for me than it did for her. But I was happy, I'm still so in love, it motivated me to work on myself. Like really motivated me, to get her back BUT also for myself. For the first time I also did it for myself. So I did voluntary work again the past weeks, it felt good, it felt good to work on myself. I had a lot hope that me and her could maybe work it out. Last week I told her how I felt, I mean she still knew that but I just wanted to let her know that nothing had changed. The week after that I just couldn't sleep, eat, think properly so I decided to ask her to come over again. I just had to ask her if there was any chance she wanted to try it again with me. She told me not right now, she said she didn't feel the same anymore. I think deep inside I probably knew that, but I had hope. And somehow I still have hope, and I still want to wait. But knowing this now, I just don't know what to do anymore. Everything I ever did the last few years were for her and not really for me. I need someone in my life, I want it to be her but that's not possible right now. But I don't know if I can handle waiting. To be honest, I don't really want to anymore. I don't really want to live anymore because I'm sure as hell not going to do it for myself, I'm not motivated at all to work on myself. My suicidal thoughts are more present than they have ever been. Not sure if I could go through with that but I don't know.",21Jul2020,1

My husband however has cried for an hour and a half. I am so tired of not having somebody to allow me to be weak I feel that I am always having to be dominant and strong. 
I recently realized that I have a desire to be domineered and abused. I’m starting to look for an opportunity to be abused. But I do not know where to begin to find such an opportunity.

50,"This is a lot to unpack but I need it off my chest and heart and could really use some sort of guidance as I feel completely overwhelmed:

Let me start of by saying I come from what would be known as a “white trash” lower-income family with mental health issues so if that makes you uncomfortable please move past this. 

I’m an early 30s gay man and I’ve been in a monogamous relationship for close to a decade. I come from a deeply dysfunctional home with a meth addict, abusive father who only became “clean” my junior year of high school after being arrested with an 8-ball of meth in his pocket and an enabling mother who has martyred her life and happiness to keep her family together while refusing to recognize the dysfunction or pain anyone may have felt at the hands of another. I am the only person in my family to attend college and one of two siblings who moved FAR away. After my father became clean it took years to trust him but I started developing a relationship with him until 8 years ago he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and given 5 years to live.  Somehow he has beaten the odds and is still alive today.  But then 3 years ago we found out he’d been having a multiple year affair with another woman. My enabling mother still won’t leave him so I put a boundary in place that i will no longer talk to him or visit until he passes to protect my own mental health. I haven’t been home since 2014 or seen my family since 2016. Needless to say, my connection to my own family is very limited.

That said, I recognize similarities/traits of both of my parents in myself and I fear I am becoming them in my own relationship despite my best efforts.  At the beginning of my relationship my boyfriend was more passive/docile. He didn’t ever fight and didn’t communicate well when there were issues.  I honestly and regrettably walked all over him. I didn’t share my feelings/concerns/vulnerabilities because I was taught (unfortunately) that they are weak. So the first few years of our relationship were blissfully wonderful to me as I was unaware of any issues while belittling his feelings and being a bit controlling (a characteristic I NOW recognize in myself due to having so much chaos in my life as child.) At some point he started to stand up for himself, there were issues because of it and because I didn’t yet recognize my own unhealthy learned behaviors.  It started to feel like he always had one foot out the door and we discussed it regularly because he self-admittedly did but said he wanted the relationship to work.  I thought things were improving, we moved on. Issues would arise again: one foot out the door.  The cycle repeats.  

When my family visited me just before we found out about dads affair, issues were brought up and ultimately a repressed memory of sexual abuse toward me was brought to light. I went into a deep downward spiral of depression that I was unable to pull myself out of or work through. My boyfriend has never been able to wrap his head around my family’s dysfunction.  I can’t blame him, it is a lot.  When I share issues with him about my family he listens quietly but has never been able to connect with me or understand it.  So when the sexual abuse/depression came about he started to go numb because I was numb.  We honestly lost what connection we had, but I felt (due to being raised by an enabling co-dependent mother) I couldn’t live without him and he felt because we had a foundation and time together, we should still give us a chance. I gained 30 pounds, my self-esteem was out the door, and I felt completely disconnected from myself. 

I found out on my own a couple years ago that my boyfriend had an affair during that time with someone I thought was a mutual friend.  He lied about it continuously before finally admitting it happened and admitted he had fallen in love with the man. He claimed it only happened once but he is unaware that I found out more.  I do know it ended.  I know it’s over.  But I know they maintain a friendship still and it hurts me deeply and he knows that.  In the last two years I have been working on me and my mental health. I started working out, I was losing a good amount of weight until quarantine hit, I started to feel like me again and I recognized the learned behaviors that had been detrimental to myself and my relationship and have been unlearning them. We communicate better than we ever have and have felt closer than we have ever felt! He tells me when he has issues with my actions/words, I do the same, we talk it out respectfully and come to resolutions and actually put those resolutions into actions.

But during quarantine he started to recognize his own mental health issues and admitted to me that he is depressed and needs a therapist. (We both do, but funds are tight.) He told me he is not sure if he is in love with me but also didn’t know if it’s because of his depression issues or otherwise.  And yet I stay.  And i feel my self esteem slipping because I made so many positive changes in myself and it feels like I am still not enough for him. That he still has that foot out the door.  

I am scared because in some ways I have been my father in this relationship, in some ways he has had been my father, and in a lot of ways I have been my mother. 

It’s easy to say “this relationship is toxic, break up!” It’s harder to be committed and put in the work. I want to put in the work. But I don’t know if that’s the enabling, martyr mother in me talking or if it’s healthy anymore. 

I’m lost. I’m emotional.  I’m tired.  And I am starting to feel disconnected from myself again.

I said “idk why I’m trying, it’s not like we will ever get back together” and she said “ofcourse there is a chance” which I think was just her getting in my head because I’m doing everything and she keeps withdrawing and remembering our relationship in ways that it wasn’t. I don’t know who she’s talking to but she always denies it when I ask if there is anyone else. The point is I can’t really see myself feeling this pain anymore. I’ve came to the realization that I do want to take my own life. I’m 34, she had been my everything for every single day since I met her 4 years ago. We always texted and talked every single day since we met, we made love 2 days after meeting and I moved in with her a few days later. She has cheated on me and lied about me and blamed me for things she had done yet as long as she is here and I can hold her and she says she loves me then I don’t care about anything else. But she is slipping away no matter what I do. I cannot go on like this. I don’t know what to do anymore. I mean how can she go from saying “ I love you “ to me after 2 days, she called off her engagement to someone she had known for 8 years for me after knowing me for 2 days, and she proposed to me after 3 months to what she does now? It makes no sense..

Ps I’m almost certain she has a B type cluster personality disorder and possibly a sociopath and I have depression.",21Jul2020,1

66,"I suspect my mom has been depressed for many, many years. After both Grandparents died in the early 2000's she was overcome with grief and quit her job as a nurse and stayed home while my dad worked. My dad was pretty angry and emotionally abusive and continues to be so to this day (not as bad). 

She is nearing 60 years old and has no friends, no hobbies, never leaves the house, does not really take care of herself. She just cooks and cleans for me and my dad (we both work) and watches youtube and TV for hours all day, everyday, late into the night. She tells me she wants desperately to go back to work but keeps putting it off month after month because she is terrified about of her ability to keep up with Technology in nursing. She broke down to me several times about how she doesn't love my Dad and hates where we live and is very unhappy. 

I've suggested counseling but she is very against it as there is an old school stigma about only crazy people get counseling. I'm not sure what to do or how to help her and would appreciate any input.",21Jul2020,1

70,"Me (16M) her(17F). 

Recently I have ruined a relationship with the person I love. We have been on and off for 6 months now with what I thought was an okay relationship. It's my first time ever being in love with someone and I wouldn't say I love anyone else even parents or siblings, all of which I've had shaky relationships with mainly due to me messing them up as well. 

She feels as though I do not care about her issues of which she has many and that I have been in the relationship only for sexual and physical reasons. She feels underappreciated both physically and emotionally and says that she hasn't once felt that I've truly appreciated her in these areas. She had an amazing personality that I love very dearly and is a beautiful person. I've fucked up more than once but each time we've gotten back together. I've never been great at apologizing and this time she has told me basically that she feels I do not care about her. I can see why she would think that. I'm bad at expressing myself especially in expressing affection towards others as it's not something I normally due and I'm also shitty at apologizing. I've hurt her and I feel as though I can't repair the relationship that I have had with her. The things that I tried to help her with didn't work and they didn't help her. I feel defeated and like I've ruined the last good relationship I have. I know that I'm at fault for what's happening but it is making me feel horrible as well. I've been having thoughts that I just ruin every relationship I ever have so why bother living anymore. I keep on repeating one solution in my thoughts but at the same time I've always thought that suicide is never the answer. This is probably an incoherent mess made by someone who deserves none of your sympathy. I really do love her and im dissapointed in myself that I couldn't show that to her proper.",21Jul2020,1

73,"Soooo yea here it goes, before I start this sorry for any spelling mistakes.

Cast:

Cat: The HSP 5th grader with depression and low self esteem GF: My adorable ""girlfriend"" at the time BFF: My main emotional crutch due to being the only friend I can relate to (My girlfriend and I are like oppisites attract) Ms. B: My jerk @$$ math teacher Principal/P:My idiot principal Mom: My amazing mom Ms. Y: My teacher whos obsessed with yelling and EK: A girl who bullies me and BFF but adores GF and tries to steal her from us constantly

Okay this whole ordeal started with Cat and her passion for art, oneday Cat brought her sketchbook to school she LOVED to draw but her teachers didn't like her passion. One day P madea new rule that NO ONE could bring ANYTHING anywhere! This made Cat VERRRY angry, she had two times per day to draw traditional art, at home she slaved away and animations for her YT channel! The two times we're at aftercare and recess, and occasionally after she finished her work now two of those times had been taken from her.

Cat brought her sketchbook to school and was scolded for it. Cat used a small bag due to her school not requiring her to bring anything so her sketchbook poked out. Cat also brought mechanical pencils in her purse but the school put a ban on her purse aswell. Now Cat had a GIANT problem with losing her pencils and would not could not use reg. pencils soooo she lost a lot of pencils to this ban. Now for some more well.. here's where my mental health begins to rapidly decline

Cat walked into her math class with her sketchbook and purse of mechanical pencils. Ms. ""B: CAT! How DARE you bring that purse and sketchbook into MY class. Those were BANNED you IDIOT! Put them back in your cubby."" Cat: ""But-"" Ms B: ""Uh uh uh PUT. THEM. BACK."" Cat reluctantly put put them back, holding back tears. This was when she knew this would be a ROUGH year.

The second story involves GF. Now GF had sprained her knee in gymnastics, now Ms. Y had appointed cat o be her personal assistant basically. Cat followed GF everywhere and got stuff for her, held her stuff, and even went down the elevator with her! But Ms. B didn't care about this. She just had EK get stuff for GF even tho GF HATED EK! Me and BFF we're pissed but Ms. B didn't give a shit.

Cat put up with so much of Ms. B's bullcrap until she snapped, she started trying to stay home as much as possible and eating candy that she snuck into school all day and 4/5 days a week would leave Ms. B's class crying, smiling, and laughing. She soon spiraled into a deep, deep, depression. BFF: ""Cat, just tell your parents already!"" Cat: ""No, they won't listen..."" BFF and Cat had this conversation nearly DAILY until she DOUBLE SNAPPED.

But this was the last straw. Ms B: ""CAT what is that under your desk!?"" She'd snatch up Cats sketchbook and FLIP THROUGH IT gasping, seeing some of her diary notes and drawings where she'd discribed her suicidal thoughts and hatred twards Ms. B but Ms. B SCOLDED HER FOR DRAWING IMAGES OF DEAD CHARACTERS AND SUICIDE AND HATRED OBVIOUSLY TWARDS HER! This woman... OH THIS WOMAN. SHE DROVE CAT TO ATTEMPT SUICIDE WITH SCISSORS AND TRY TO STRANGLE HERSELF. And she SCOLDED HER for trying TO COPE WITH HER.

Than Cat told GF and BFF about her suicide attempts... GF cared about Cat verry much and after Cats second attempt told Mom. Mom asked Cat why she wouted ld try to kill herself? And the truth about Ms. B came out and how she had insulted Cat, flipped through her PRIVATE SKETCHBOOK, given her MORE HOMEWORK, and SCOLDED HER for her coping mechanisms!

Mom knew she had to get Cat out of that class IMMEDIATLY and emailed P if there were any other options, and all the stuff Cat told her. THREE DAYS LATER P said Cat could go to a FOURTH GRADE math class.Both Mom and Cat agreed that being in a fourth grade class felt more like a punishment, keep in mind there were two other 5th grade teachers who were doing legit nothing. So mom emailed P to ask for another option P said no.

Moms next resort was to have Cat change schools and keep her home while waiting for a response. But before the response arrived there was a field trip to the local Middle School Cat needed to go on. Now Cat went, reluctantly this next story mainly deals with Ms. Y and yea. So Cat, BFF, and GF were talking Ms. Y comes over and goes ""CAT, BFF, GF SHUT UP AND LISTEN"" but when EK is talking with her friends Ms.Y does nothing! Later on Ms. Y does this AGAIN. And now for the LAST WORDS EK SAID TO CAT BEFORE SHE LEFT! ""You don't know how to act!"" she said when Cat told her that she was leaving for Ms. B bullying her.

I had been going for a few months, she didn't believe me for a very long time, but finally made me go when school counselors got involved (and has held it over my head as an example of what a great parent she is quite a few times). Anyways, summer has been very bad for me. I've asked multiple times, and she either ignores me or just says that she'll book an appointment and never does. I honestly despise her. I hate that I am dependent on a main contributor to my mental health issues to help me fix my mental health issues. We are fine financially and we have insurance. I'm fucking frustrated. And I can never find a therapist I like, and I hate being forced to communicate to her about all these things about who I should see, why mine isn't a good fit, why I need to go. How is any kid or teen supposed to seek help for personal and family related issues when finding help has to involve said family? I can't even imagine how bad severely abused kids have it. It's not like I can use a hotline or online therapy because that's not confidential (as if actual therapy for minors even is) / will charge my phone, which she will see. I feel so horrible all the time, and there's nothing I can do.

Sometimes I think that if I drive fast enough then I won't feel anything, which isn't any different from the way I feel right now. Sometimes I have a strong urge to take as many melatonin pills so I can try to sleep forever. I just want to stop hearing my own thoughts. I don't want to hear anything anymore.

Over the past couple of days I have been posting multiple incidents of mine and my fiancee that happened over the past few months on various subreddits. The intention is to get to know from people who have been in an abusive relationships on how to handle such situations. The intention is not Karma farming.

My fiancee would get really angry over something really trivial and start to throw things at me. She would throw knifes and glass which made me hold her hands to prevent her from doing so. Soon after, she starts to cry and says that I am hurting her and that she would call 911. She takes her phone and I see her dial 9-1.... I get scared and go grab her phone . She becomes wild as a result and starts to bang her head against the wall and goes ""I am going to die by holding my breath"". How do you even handle such a situation? Do I just let her dial 911 ?(I have been advised not to since I have held her hands and that is restraining. The cops would just arrest me) . But, taking her phone to prevent her causes her to go even more violent . She even took my phone and slammed it against the wall once because I wouldnt give her phone back. It's crazy.

After holding on to her phone for about 20 minutes (during which she hit me spit on me), she automatically calmed down only to go to the bedroom and lock herself for hours.",21Jul2020,1

We explore what kinds of conditions typically lead to workers going on strike, and how those conditions can be mapped into the individualistic mental health model as symptoms of depression and anxiety (ie, a sense of dread, feeling helpless and powerless, self-blame, etc). Rachel shares with us the mental health benefits she experienced from joining the wildcat strike along with thousands of other grad students risking their careers (and some being injured by police) in hopes of achieving a better quality of life for themselves as well as everyone else.

89,"I (22M) have a neighbor (41M) who is now a good friend of mine and has a family. As I’ve gotten to know them I believe his daughter (14F) has DID (dissociative identity disorder)

She claims that she has conversations with people in her own mind and that sometimes they take over and it has happened (unless she’s messing with me but I doubt it) to me first hand.

Her alters are “Blade” who is a male who is aggressive to protect her from harm. Another is “Anna” who is passive and emotionless. And “Lily” is a little who apparently represents the childhood she wanted to have.

I’m not familiar with any of this. I’m the one who told her what I believe is “wrong” (bad terminology I know) with her and she can start by fixing it by realizing what her issues are and to look into more.

I’ve tried convincing her to talk to her family (me doing that might result in something bad as she has talked about suicide as a last resort if she can’t handle it any longer— which of course I tried to deter her away from) but regardless she refuses to talk to her family claiming she has tried before and it only made her life worse.

She also experiences panic attacks from this, which I do have experience with. 

I’m not sure what to do or who to tell... if I tell anyone what I believe is happening, she would see this as a betrayal and I might miss the chance to keep her from self harm.... on the other hand, if I tell it might be what keeps her from self harm and possibly a chance towards therapy.

She has also said her school counselor is super old and hard hearing and was not helpful... then again I think her just now realizing her symptoms could change that?

I honestly do not know. I hate to do nothing, but I know it’s not my family and for me to try telling someone’s family what is wrong with their kid will probably not go well and could make her life worse.

I'm wondering what are ""biomarkers"" of various mental health issues (objective / measurable attributes which highly correlate with having mental disorders).

120,"First off I should start by adding that I'm Aspergic, so this may make things a bit more complex.

Something that has been apparent since I was a kid was that I like to think about everything. Unless it's something I have an obsession with, I can never think about just one thing at once. My brain is always trying to piece things together, recognise patterns or find solutions for any problems I am having in regards to issues in my life.

When I'm alone this gets worse. I write things down, I type them out, I do everything I can to get thoughts out of my head. The moment I do however they are replaced with a new one, a new question or a new fear I have to resolve.

Talking to people makes this easier, but over my 25 years of life I've found it very difficult to make very firm, stable friendships. I have a lot of acquaintances but a very small circle. I do have a girlfriend, however she lives overseas.

I'm becoming more problematic being caught in my head, I over think about everything but even worse is I cannot bare the feeling of isolation when my mind runs rampant.

I’m usually anxious because of my reasons. This feeling has been with me and it goes away only sometimes.

My thoughts connect to each other like a pattern and all involve past behaviours.

E.G see a picture of a dog---&gt; remember when as a teen I used to smack my dog as a punishment, however I don't do that anymore---&gt; feel panic and that I'm kidding myself and that I used to hit him more than once when he was naughty and I enjoyed it----&gt; even if this wasn't true I still hit him and that's abuse and disgusting and why should I carry on with the nice life I have. 

E.G. 2 remember or see the name of someone I had a drunk one night stand with where I blacked out for a bit of the sex and can't remember actually going to sleep after----&gt; what if the bits of the sex I can't remember I forced her to do things she didn't want to do----&gt; try and check if she is viewing and liking things on Instagram as a sign she still likes me and nothing bad happened-----&gt; resist the urge to message her asking if the sex was fully consensual. (this happened 3 years ago).

Just two examples but I also get scared in the future I might hit my boyfriend or do something like that even though I haven't ever got close to feeling that anger and urge to be physically aggressive in my life except a couple of times as a young teen. 

Does anyone have any tips to break this cycle, as soon as I 'resolve' one, my brain will pick another.

I have counselling sessions but I don't know if they help with this particularly ^ as they're general and if I mention things they will just try to provide reassurance, and although I don't know if I have OCD I don't really know what if that will work.

This overthinking reaction led me to higher levels of anxiety. I couldn't even talk to a gay guy without feeling a horrible stomachache.

143,"**Before you read any of this- this is quite long and not all the details have been addressed. In short my mother has times where she is paranoid and illogical (people going to kill us or attack us), but also times where her mind is normal/clearer- she knows what she has said is illogical, and knows she needs to see a doctor**

\*A lot of this is going to be quite specific, but I feel like I have no one else to talk to about this. I've definitely missed out on a bit of the whole situation, but there's so much going on 

My mother has been through a lot through her life; things she's managed to push through.

She worked for a local council as a caretaker, where she helped care/supervise old people. She liked this part of the job. Then she took an office job at the same council- working on calling clients, which she didn't exactly like; the hours were a lot worse and draining. But the job wasn't the key problem.

There were a few workers at the council who she had trouble with; they would indirectly bully her by not taking any of the calls, so the workload on her was excessive. The environment according to my mother was toxic and quite childish- like unnecessary taking behind backs, etc. 

1 year passes- about May or so; mother has a breakdown- she reports a certain person (call her BULLY) who she has ranted about for the past year for bullying her, due to encouragement through my father and a desire for herself to stand up for herself. I did not know she was going to do this; and I would have advised against doing this- because I believe you stand up to your bullies by telling to ""piss off"" in front of them. However, she told this to HR or someone. 

\~My mother is not exactly the strongest in terms of will- she prefers a simple life, which I completely understood; now and then 

She reported this person, who was bullying her- I believe this- but I don't think this bullying was that extreme (it was playground bullying). My mother made it sound like it was vile and criminal.

A week later, she stops working- taking some time off from the office- and she said that she wants BULLY to leave the office, because she cannot stand the sight of the awkwardness within the office of seeing BULLY; also I inferred that seeing BULLY's face, reminded her of all the bad stuff in the past. 

Now at this point, I'm thinking fine; I get it- the bullying is not extreme, but I get it- you need some time off to heal from a lot of working for the last 10+ years (mother has not really taken breaks off work)

However, at home, she doesn't have a lot to do- there's the COVID outbreak (last month or so), and she can't do anything 

**Now this is where things go south. (a lot of this does not make logical sense at all- I can't understand it either)**

Initially I thought good, this could all be ending. She quits her office job, after saying she'll fight to see BULLY out of the office. She sends email after email. 

She says the council is attacking her; her managers have also been involved in indirect bullying (nothing personal, but in terms of work- not okay); she thinks the emails they send back to her are threats/or mocking remarks- such as ""Hope you are okay or get well soon"". She prints out messages sent by the council and says she cannot trust anyone except for her family. 

As soon as she got emails, she'd freak out and have panic attacks. Like she emailed them- in regards to sick leave and whatever- and as soon as they replied saying it's okay- she'd freak out from these notifications. Also, at this point she was saying that the council has secrets that they were hiding, and that they were attacking her (my mother) because she knew these secrets.   
I asked her- what are these secrets? She freaked out- and said it doesn't matter. 

At this point she's also been seeing a counsellor and a doctor to talk- but then after the counsellor sends out a surveymonkey link to review how good the counsellor's services were; which she thought was some sort of hacking website so later at night she started thinking that the counsellor was attacking her because this website was a ""hacking website"" (I told her it was a legit website later) and she was scared that the council was going to attack her doctor too. The doctor gave her some advice, which she has not followed, because she believed that it wasn't effective for her. 

A lot happened on that day- she got a breast screening notification up- she'd done one 2 days before- and she thought it was the council using the breast screening centre to mock her about potential cancer (our family has a history of breast cancer btw)

**It gets worse from here**

She starts freaking out over devices- turning off location on phones- she legit woke me up and started panicking that people (the council) were tracking her. I turned it off for her, but I asked her how does the council have the technology to do this- they're not that smart and they don't have the resources.

She takes her SIM card out and then I disable her phone's email function for her; she even turns bluetooth off. She has complete distrust for the phone. She doesn't use phone anymore.

Next the Ipad. Then the TV- she thinks the DVD player (which is old af btw) is dodgy, then the computer (windows 10) which needs updating- she thinks the update is dodgy. SO now she's only watching live TV (country from where she comes from); she doesn't like live TV from where we live now. 

I got a delivery the other day; she thinks the postman is a hitman- tells me not to go outside- I tell her its fine. 

She thinks cars passing our house is dodgy, thinks there are airplanes flying above- thinks they are dodgy too. 

There's so much more I can add; she breaks down crying for no reason sometimes, she worries for me and my father's safety- saying we're being tracked or something, saying our internet's dodgy, etc.. 

**From the start I wasn't sure, I thought she might have had a mental illness, but I wasn't sure. I'm fairly sure you guys can confirm with me that she does have one. I think it's delusion or paranoia, but it was triggered by an issue that was so small. I personally think the bullying event wasn't horrendous- I just think it took her beyond what she could deal with (she's dealt with far worse things)**

In the past she has had depression (20+ years ago) when she gave birth to my sibling; at that time when she forgot her bank details and couldn't get in- she accused my father of planning to take money and leave her with the baby (this was my dad's word- i wasn't born yet) 

**VERY IMPORTANT- this is what is very confusing about this whole situation. She isn't always illogical. She's normal at times- I don't know if she's hiding her feelings or acting, but I believe she is okay at times. When she calls her doctor, her parents, she sounds fine; so they might think she is fine, but really she has a lot of spells of paranoia** 

There is limited help we can get at the moment- my mother knows her mental state is not okay- at times her mental state is clearer- and she can sort of realise that her actions/words don't always make sense, but sometimes she just is out of it (memory unclear, depressed).

I don't know who we can call (COVID restrictions); but I'd prefer face-to-face consultations for her- and I'd like to explain to the doctor her situation- because I'm fairly sure she could act normal in front of doctors. But services are so limited- and a call is not going to help her

TL;DR: [Seeking advice: 27F, new to mental health treatment] Therapist of a couple months referred me to an outpatient program. The assigned Therapist never showed up to the follow-up and psychiatrist was belittling. 

-- 

(Forgive me in advance, this is an incredibly long post and dialogue; I've also made a TL;DR version too) I was seeing therapist for a couple of months (Beginning of May--late June) until she thought it was best for me to be in a more extensive program. I found her through my psychiatrist's referral list.

Being that I (27F) never explored mental health treatment/being on meds for the first time and building this connection with her, I trusted her judgement.

She referred me to an outpatient program. I'm in the process of the evaluations (saw the therapist and psychiatrist in the last 2 weeks) but, I feel so many red flags. I don't have a benchmark to compare these feelings with but, I just know when my gut doesn't feel right. 

Below is the extensive timeline of my treatment so far in the new program as of 07/07:

-07/07 As I was checking into my first appointment last week, the nurse in the front desk took my info and said, ""the therapist told you to arrive a half hour early to fill out paperwork"", She didn't. I never even spoke to her; I was speaking directly with their program director. After saying I wasn't informed of that, she ignored me.

-The appointment was fine. I thought it was nice of her to process my appointments right then and there before I left, both for my follow-up and  an appointment with the psychiatrist... until the day came, and I didn't receive an email with a virtual session invite nor a phone call. 

-Eventually I called her; she returned my call, saying that she ""must've forgot to confirm my appointment in her system""...... thankfully, I had a day off so, when she asked if I had any window of time open, I took it.

-Virtual meeting was fine (my previous therapist was remote so, I didn't mind it at all). She asked how I was feeling, I was talking through it... and then, suddenly, at 30 mins, she cuts me short and says ""were out of time"". I didn't realize it was only a half hour.

-This week was my psychiatrist appointment virtually at 10am. 10:10 rolls around; nothing. 10:30... so I call my therapist, pretty much politely asking wtf is going on. I'm working from home right now so, luckily it's not a time constraint. But, nonetheless, it's still wasted time.

-Ironically, a couple of minutes after leaving her a voicemail, I receive a text message - ""[Dr. John Smith] is inviting you to a video call"" with a link.  No email. I was immediately triggered to see a male doctor's name. I wouldn't have accepted this appointment if I knew it was a male psychiatrist so, I checked on the appointment card. The therapist put ""Dr. [Smith]""... no first name.
--&gt; (backstory): I'm a rape/sexual abuse and assault survivor practically half my life. So when the program director asked me, ""would you prefer to work with a male or female mental health professional?"" I said female. I felt bad for being picky but... I just knew I wouldn't feel as open/comfortable.

-We get on a video call (at this point, it's 10:45) and I immediately let him know that I told the program director I would happily wait until my providers were female only. He was taken aback after saying he wasn't informed by this, which I understood. And he said he'd call me back with some clarity. 

-After calling me back, ""emphasizing policy"", and how ""difficult it actually is to schedule an appointment as soon as I was able to"", if I can just do the initial evaluation with him and then they will advise a female psychiatrist after. I agreed as long as it meant they would make sure it was a female and I didn't mind how long it took.

-He's asking me questions, and cutting me off along the way... but what really set me off was when he asked me who referred me to their clinic. After mentioning, ""my previous therapist bc she felt, being I never been in the mental health space before, that I deserve more extensive support and care"", he asked, (dialogue below):

--

Dr.: ""what type of care did she expect you to get here?"" 

Me: ""support group, having therapist and psychiatrist all under 1 umbrella""

Dr.: ""I just don't understand what she means by ""support"". Who did you say you spoke to prior to scheduling your appointments again? 

Me: [Says program director's name]

Dr.: ""We don't know of that name (???). I just wonder what your previous therapists ""type of clientele"" is and what she expected for you in this.""

Me: ""I've never done any treatment as I said...-""

--

At this point, I'm on the verge of tears, confused, it's past 11:45 at this point/I have no idea how long this session was supposed even last, and I feel uncomfortable, so I proceeded with:
--

Me: ""--and I do want to see through other options, and decide what is the best care for me at this point.""

Dr.: ""Let me just make sure I am hearing you correctly... you don't know if you want to move forward with this clinic because, in the beginning, your expectations weren't met and you had a male psychiatrist?""

Me: ""No. That's not it.""

Dr.: ""So help me understand, please.""

So, I lost it:
Me: ""Not only that I wasn't listened to, but I told [program director] that I didn't mind waiting until a female was available, being a rape and trauma survivor.. And, now you're telling me that you have never even heard of her name.""

(As he tries cutting me off, I proceed)

""The therapist here even forgot to schedule me in last week; I had to call her. Our appointment today was over 30 minutes behind schedule. I don't know the appropriate jargon to use for my circumstance but I was referred here by my former therapist who clearly thought I deserved more after never being in treatment in life. And you comment on her clientele... I don't know how this all works but I just want to be in the right hands, which is very hard to tell where that is right now.""

He apologized for the comment, said he was ""thinking out loud""... I didn't accept the apology because you're a fucking psychiatrist. You're not my friend or colleague; and I don't know you enough to rationalize with anything you're saying. (Not to mention, when asking me if my feelings were covid-related or if I felt this way all my life, I shared with him that my grandma passed from covid in March. He didn't make a single comment of support, nor did my therapist). 

I haven't been able to sleep because I just feel so lost. I genuinely liked my former therapist despite only working with her a couple of months. As much as I appreciated her looking into this program for me and emphasizing the care I needed, that she couldn't give me because of the pandemic... I also felt neglected, and unworthy. And, those feelings are resurfacing. 

I don't know enough to know if I should power through the first few sessions or to walk away. I feel like I should suck it up and that I should feel lucky... while the other part of me feels like I'm being treated like shit and feel wrong for wanting more support. But, my gut feeling hasn't let me down ever, and I felt so uncomfortable.

If you made it this far, thank you for reading. If you can provide any insight into your experience/know of others' experiences, I would appreciate anything you can share. If this really isn't right and should look into other programs, please let me know. Or, if I should just continue seeing my current psychiatrist and seek a new therapist? My current psychiatrist is absolutely wonderful... she's kind, actively listening to me all the time, explaining the processes/diagnoses to me thoroughly...

All I want to do is get better. I appreciate your time in reading this. 💛",21Jul2020,1
147,"My therapist asked me this today. I felt like it would be offensive to say yes, and clichéd to say no. I know I've been awesome in handling mental health and overcoming my fears but I can't use tangible terms to justify that to someone. But the question wasn't if someone else likes me, it was if I like myself. Why is this so hard. Can I say yes? I should be able to say yes. I value myself more now. I trust myself more. I take care of myself more than ever before. Do I like me? Hmmmm. I like me for being able to value myself. Is that enough of a reason to like me? I know my therapist is kind. I know she didn't ask me if I thought I was worthy of being liked.",21Jul2020,3
148,"So I've had ""anxiety"" ever since I was little, but honestly I feel like that doesn't really explain what I'm going through. But I'll give you some background so were on the same page here.

When I was a kid, I used to be afraid of the dark, especially sleeping. I had these recurring thoughts that something bad would happen during the night, like I would be attacked by vampires or would get sleep paralysis (reading about SP really effed me up) and I would regularly try and ""avoid"" these things by sleeping in a certain way, like on my stomach or by avoiding certain times, like I couldn't go to sleep at 3am exactly. I would also say a prayer each evening since I come from a religious family, but had to stop since it got to a point where I had to say multiple prayers because I ""wasn't sure"" if I said it properly and it got pretty obnoxious. I was sure, always, but it didn't help. I've also had these feelings that if I think about certain stuff, like swimming or the sea when I go to sleep I might somehow drown or end up in the ocean, just by thinking about them. So I would try and avoid these thoughts.
 
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm no longer afraid of the dark really and quite ironically, I suffer from high-frequency sleep paralysis... But it's ok since it's usually not scary for me. However, I got hit by a much, much more severe episode of anxiety when I started college. Long story short, I became certain that I was developing schizophrenia or other permanent psychotic illness. So certain, that I would at points not sleep for a week straight and I completely lost my belief in a bright future. I was certain that my life was over.

Well, it wasn't, and I recovered just fine in a couple of months. But turns out, this theme was recurring: last year, I got a similar episode again, and spent another couple of months in a state of stress and hopelessness. Both episodes were accompanied by frenzied googling to calm myself. But hey, it did not calm me at all: the internet made it pretty clear I was going insane. In the end, I again recovered.
 
Right now, the reason I'm writing this, is that I'm going through a similar, but different theme. I've been kind of worried that we live in a simulation, and that the beings running the simulation would want to hurt me. I keep getting these nightmare scenarios in my head and find it hard to get rid of them, as I keep thinking that the simulators could make those scenarios happen. I get these violent and scary flashes that distress me and I feel like if I think about this too much they'll come true.

To make things clear: I do NOT believe any of this is happening. I'm simply worried over quite literally nothing.

Other quirks I've had: I sometimes get very worried in movie theaters and public transport etc. over silly things like someone there having a bomb. I'm sometimes afraid random people out there, like let's say beggars that I don't give money to or people I looked at funnily would follow me home and attack me. I have to check my whole apartment when I get home to make sure no one is there, and I often double check the front door. Sometimes I even look under my bed lol. I also regularly get worried about my home burning down so I often go the extra mile to unplug everything when I go to sleep or leave my home, often double checking everything.

Does anyone see a throughline here? Is it just ""unspecified anxiety""? Where could I look for help?

TL;DR - I get worried about random bad things happening to me or something/someone hurting me simply because I think about those things, or do something ""wrong"", and it causes me distress. I also often worry about ""going insane"". Does anyone know what I might be going through?",21Jul2020,1

155,"So, I recently got sober, 5 months and a day ago. When I was actively using, (everything in the book except PCP, for good reason), I sought some sort of psychiatry assessment, because many of my associates had called into question my mental well being, and I was starting to question it as well. Namely, I generally enjoy violence and suffering to a degree and take pleasure in other creatures' emotional and physical pain, yet I am conflict avoidant when possible because I realize that sacrificing my own comfort is not a viable option to me because I would detest nothing more than sacrificing my own self will. I was turned away on account of the fact that I was actively using, understandably that can cause issues with coming to a diagnosis. Since I have been sober, nothing has really changed. People who name me as their friend receive no trust from me, and I get annoyed with others if they can't deal with the realities of the world. I view all perceived weakness with disdain, but bring it up tactfully, tailored to the individuals personality to try to influence the persons behavior to better suit me, either through an alluring, appealing idea, or drawing parallels of their current thoughts to something that will cause a degree of revulsion. I still have noticed no change in empathy. For instance, there was a squirrel on the road and my friend and his gf went onto the other lane to avoid it. When the stupid thing ran at, instead of away from our direction of travel, they both freaked out and I just yelled ""Die!""  I know self diagnosing is a bad idea, but I am having my doubts about psychiatry, because even if I get a diagnosis of any kind, I can't see that it would help me in the least. I will still be the same person, with the same viewpoint, and a diagnosis would just put a name onto something that I am already aware of. Should I seek a diagnosis, or should I simply accept that I am me, whoever me is?",21Jul2020,1
156,"my background: Ive had a troubled childhood; when I started working when I was 15 I got heavy panic attacks and some time later I was diagnosed with clinical depressions
I was in therapy for about 4 years, got antidepressants and made very good progress
Everytime that I get the feeling of depression I now know how to handle it and how to break out of the cycle of bad thoughts

Present day - I'm in my early 20s, I have a great job, a wonderful girlfriend and a small but good circle of friends

But every other day I start to question some aspect of my life, like ""I would rather be single"", ""I want a job where I have less hours/stress so I can focus on hobbies and working out"" or ""All my friends are so much luckier than me in life"" etc. etc. 

As I've mentioned before, I don't get stuck in these thought loops anymore but they still cost a lot of energy and change my mood for the worse

Thinking back to 16, 17 y/o me, I should be so happy with my current situation


Is it sign that I tell myself too much that I'm happy or that I must be happy? 
Is it a repercussion/byeffect of my depressions? 

Does anyone else have similar feelings?",21Jul2020,3
157,"This particular thing happened about 3-4 times, twice I remember more vividly. Its really strange and I've tried looking it up but to no luck so if I could get some insights that'll be great.

There's like a beat in my ears/chest but it's not something I can hear, more feel. I don't think it's my heartbeat or pulse because it was going way too fast? It speeds up when I move even the slightest or when I hear something fast paced, so when it happened I did my best to not move at all. It sucks because it throws me off and makes me feel funny? I don't really know how to explain it but it's not a nice feeling. Sometimes it gets so fast it kind of mashes together into a incoherent mess. I get a little panicked and disoriented when it gets fast. 

The first time I went out to the living room looking for my parents for help I guess and they brought me a bucket saying I looked like I was going to throw up. I couldn't walk fast because of reasons above and kind of stared into space for the whole duration.

The second time I tried focusing on a spot and it sort of worked before I lost it again and for a period of time in that duration I had racing thoughts about the most random things that didn't even make sense.

Both times happened after I suddenly woke up and didn't stop until I fell asleep which probably would have been 15 minutes later?

This was an era of getting into trouble, doing things I'm definently not pround of and pretending to be someone who I absolutely wasnt. Although I've grown, I still carry some of the traits and habits developed since then. 

I really want to go back to the way it was. I feel like if I carried the same traits from back then I would be a lot happier and I would have more time to focus on my own already deteriorating mental health.
I love my friends from the bottom of my heart but I wish there was a way I could be around them without having to try so hard playing the role of ""the funny friend"" I've made for myself.

178,"I've realized that as I'm writing this some of this may not fit into the guidelines here and if so please take it down or let me know what to change.

As the title states.  I just don't know anymore.  


Let's start off with a bit of info,  
I'm 19 and I'm from Australia, NSW specifically. I've been seeing psychologists since i was 8? 9? I can't remember, my first psych wasn't doing much for me but I was too young to realize, I stopped seeing a psych for a few months before a case-worker recommended me to someone, saw them for a little and then drifted away from them. I've been seeing my current psych for... a few years now and in that time or what I'm coming to realize is that in that time I've grown to trust this person and found that they're the only person I feel safe enough and comfortable enough opening up too fully and actually trying to be fucking okay. I'm also leaving school at the end of this year and I am completely stumped and feel at a loss with what to do, I am well aware that most people feel like this, that doesn't help. School has been my life-line over the past 3 1/2 years as I've had the privilege to attend an amazing school that I could talk up for days. I've been looking for a job since I was 14/15 trying to get a job anywhere with little to nothing to show for it.   


I have mental health issues which contribute to all of the below, those being Clinical Depression and Anxiety, when I was younger I was diagnosed with O.D.D however that has been disputed and remains something to be discussed at a later date. My main issue at the moment is that I am genuinely done with living with depression, because no matter how many days in a row I may have that I don't feel like absolute shite, depression's always fucking waiting around the corner to fucking ruin my month or week or day, anxiety stops me from doing most things, if I push myself through them I find that I am able to do them even if I feel like my blood pressure is through the roof and my knees are shaking like when I MC'd at my school's Anzac day ceremony most of the time looking back or even afterwards I realize that they were well worth doing, for whatever reason that may be. However I just... I don't want to live with mental health any more, I'm so fucking over it and I don't even have anything that bad, my best friend has Schizophrenia and I've been there for them at some if not most of their worst and I know that in comparison my struggles are fucking nothing but I just do not think I am strong enough or capable with dealing with mental health anymore. I don't want to and I don't think I can.

&amp;#x200B;

My problems are that I feel like there's no escape. I have or I feel like I have so many issues and that I just don't know where to go or what to do, I feel no where near capable to be any sort independent let alone competent however my psych feels as though I've made a tremendous amount of progress over the years. (I'm self hating and realize that I cannot see when I've made progress due to the fact that I feel that any progress I make is never enough or is inadequate.) However I feel as though I've made none as though I will never be able to just be .... just be okay? just be fucking normal. My psych believes that we should be working towards ending therapy. That terrifies me, it feels like another person abandoning me. Even so, I wouldn't be able to continue seeing them in a few weeks anyway as they're becoming fully qualified which means an increase in rates, and whilst I realise that our state or country has a mental health care plan that allows me 6-10 free/rebated visits depending on the place, my mind sees it as the end.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no drive. I cannot see myself going out and getting a job, I only try because I feel as though it's what I'm supposed to do, I'm on government support now as I'm still a student and it is... barely enough to survive but it works. I've had a trial at a restaurant/fast-food mix sort of place and I was on the verge of a panic attack. I've done work experience in an office and I feel so out of place and like I'm going to be yelled at or like I'll get into trouble for anything I do. I feel as though I may not be cut out for working, though I keep trying to get a job as to not let others down.

&amp;#x200B;

School has been a life-line for me and now that it is ending I feel as though I have nothing to do with myself, It was my safe-space... I suppose, somewhere I could just exist, Fuck me I know i haven't done much if any work over the last three years, most definitely contributing to my startling lack of work ethic, low motivation and lack of being able to not procrastinate. However it provided somewhere for me to be, somewhere to make friends and have good times. Somewhere, I was allowed to grow without the fear... well without the expectations of anything on me. Now I don't think i will have anything to leave the house for, let alone get out of bed for.  


My memory. It is ... terrible, I don't know why and I struggle with it on a daily basis, it makes me feel like a terrible friend and trips me up in life so much. I need and want to fix it but I don't think I can. It affects everything above, on a small or large scale it doesn't matter because it's an issue that affects every single part of my life. It's so bad that I can barely remember what I did this morning without having to sit and think hard, I can't remember what I did a day ago without having to recount and I can barely remember basic details about my closest friends. It's terrifying.   


In conclusion, I don't know what the fuck to do anymore, fuck I never did I don't think but at least I had to be somewhere doing something, whereas now it's all up to me and I don't think that's a thing that should be up to me, I just wish someone could tell me what would work for me, what field I should go into or job. I'm done with most of what life has to offer. I don't think I even want to try to improve myself anymore, I just think that the easiest thing to do would be the best thing to do. If only I could get the god damned courage to do it.",21Jul2020,1

I am fully aware that I need to take control and care about my body NOW, but I just can’t.
I suffer from PTSD and GAD and I’m on therapy and medication. But this is something completely unexpected. 

The idea of physically taking care of my body makes me feel utterly humiliated, which is an emotion that stems from my childhood and my relationship with my mother. My mother deeply humiliated and abandoned me in regards to health issues and particularly my body.

I need to get over this but I am very aware I cannot do it with a snap of my fingers. I am really reluctant to navigate these emotions because they also bring a lot of rage and helplessness with them.

189,"Hi guys. 

A few years ago I developed general anxiety and started didn't do anything about it for a while. During this time I always felt at least a degree of anxiety which pretty much left me never feeling excitement about anything.

However about about a year ago I finished my sertraline (I was on it for about 1.5 years) and I now feel fine (almost). I don't really get anxiety at all anymore beyond a few minor situations/normal levels of nerves at times but it's a healthy amount. This is great and quality of life is miles better for me now other than the fact that I don't seem to get as excited about anything anymore like I did before I ever had anxiety. 

I can't tell if it's just the fact that I'm 25 now and I developed it when I was 21 and at university so it's just a pretty normal adult transition or if it's a residual effect of anxiety.

206,"Before I begin, I just want to say that I don’t have any kind of diagnosis in terms of mental health.

I think and dwell a little too much on two certain questions: Am I smart, and am I creative, and if I’m not, can I somehow increase my smartness and creativity? I don’t know if this rules as being insecure, since I’m not that well versed in psychology, so I was hoping to get some help here. I am highly idealistic, and I wish to somehow make a mark on the world(I know that it sounds ridiculous, just bear with me), and for that I need to have a high level of creativity and intelligence, which I’m afraid that I probably don’t have, hence the insecurity. I focus way too much in these kinds of thoughts, and I wish too not think about it that much, and sometimes I really don’t think about it, but I feel that there’s always those kinds questions somewhere in the back of my head. As for the intelligence part, I kinda got over it, and at the moment, I don’t dwell on it too much, but ever since I stopped thinking about it a lot, I have now started questioning my creativity. And that got me thinking: am I always going to question these things? If I jumped on questioning my creativity so fast after I got over the fact that I may not be smart, I fear that even if I stop asking myself the question:”Am I creative enough?”, and move on, would I just find another thing to feel bad about? I’m hoping for someone to help me with this, thanks in advance",21Jul2020,1

Basically I have a very hard time seeing beauty in black people at times and in myself as a black person and for years I’ve wished I could be ANY race but black. I have seen immense beauty in black people before but...I still feel really ugly. I have a hard time with accepting my skin tone (I’m brown/light brownish) and wish I was light skin. I am able to see the beauty in a variety of different skin tones, but for some reason, I always find deep, dark, rich skin tones most beautiful on other races/ethnicities especially those in Asia. I don’t want to admit that I just hate “looking black” like there’d be no doubt in anyone’s mind that I’m black. If I looked differently, I’d have no problem with my skin tone...I’d still want different hair though-I also have trouble accepting my hair texture which is extremely thick, 3c/4a/4b low porosity mixture and have had many breakdowns while doing it. I  almost ripped my hair out of anger before. Though I do enjoy having big thick hair...there’s so much I wish I could do with my hair that I can’t do with this texture. I love alternative fashion and crazy hairstyles like mullets and wild buzz cuts on finer/straight textured hair. It just sucks and I feel so limited. I know that type 4 hair is versatile, but I feel like that’s in regard to different braided hairstyles which I’m not interested in. And I’m not interested in wigs AT ALL. I also hate to admit that I sometimes struggle to see beauty in 4c hair...when I see people with 4c hair, I really wish I could admire it and see it as beautiful, but I just don’t. I’m so unsatisfied with my blackness and the way I look, but it’s not just because of the physical, it also has to do with how hated and misunderstood we are in society. I hate being apart of a hated race, being afraid to go outside at times with the things going on these days, being TERRIFIED of a police encounter just because I’m black. I figured having educated myself on a plethora of black issues would help me with this...but I still feel the same. I know that there’s nothing I can do to change these things about myself, nor do I want to, ( I’m not interested in plastic surgery, hair manipulation, or skin bleaching) i just want to learn to love and accept these things about myself, and other black people. I just don’t know where to start. This is making it very hard for me to even try to love myself.

210,"I draw and I'm in an art course. Technically I think there's nothing wrong with my art. I always get praised for it and I know in my head that I'm not terrible. Just that everytime I draw or something I am utterly disgustedd at what I am doing. I feel like I'm genuinely doing something worthless and my art will never improve, so why am I even TRYING. Like I should stop insulting myself and the world and put down the pen. I never finish an art piece as a result. The backlash I get from just making and seeing my art is so intense. This visceral disgust and sometimes flashbacks to certain things. The flashback s make me spiral and when I finally stop drawing, I feel DEPRESSED. And it stays for the rest of the day.

Breathe.... Take a second and breathe.. focus on your surroundings, the colour of the floor, the temperature of the air.. the ambient noise humming away in the back ground. 
And just breathe...
Big deep breaths, feel your body loosen, your mind untangle, your heart slow to a steady pace. You're okay. You may not always be okay. You might not have been okay for a good old while. But that doesn't mean you can't be okay right now. That doesn't mean you won't be okay again. 
And sometimes..okay is okay.
You haven't got to be at the height of happiness to feel... happy...
You are loved. Wanted. Needed. Essential. Matter. Important. Trusted. Cared for. 

You will be missed. Potentially more than you'll ever know. Hopefully you'll never find out just how much.. 

You may be the one hand holding another from drowning. Even though you're struggling to keep your head above water.

213,"I am the grandson of Holocaust survivors. The recent actions taken by Trump to put federal law enforcement officials in Portland, along with threatening to deploy them in other cities like Chicago, New York, etc., have triggered a feeling of intergenerational trauma that is scaring me and pushing my anxiety to extremely high levels. It is making me think of Hitler’s rise to power, how the Gestapo enforced his policies, and how my grandparents did not escape in time and endured several years of hiding from the Nazis to avoid being killed. Now, my anxiety is making me think I need to flee the country before it is too late and avoid what my grandparents went through. Is this sort of trauma abnormal? Because the political situation is largely out of my control (I will most certainly be voting for Biden, but I live in New York which will be blue no matter what), I am scared of this turning into a modern-day version of Nazi Germany. I recognize that the notion of concentration camps being formed is probably absurd, and I often find myself buying into the hysteria on Twitter, but the thought of Trump establishing any form of dictatorship shakes me to my core and brings up the horrifying stories that my grandparents have told me. How do I snap out of this and carry on with my life?",21Jul2020,3
214,"I just got told that I’m just lazy and years of trauma that haunt me everyday were belittled to “That’s a bullshit excuse, how DARE you blame your parents for that, you have some nerve criticizing your mother's parenting skills!""

That was said by my grandmother over the phone, because everyone has been yelling and arguing, and my mom called HER mom and told her about it.

Some background information.

6 years ago, I turned 18 and finished high school (I'm 24 now). I was terrified of driving, and we lived far out in the country. My mom refused to ever drive me to try and get a job, even when she had to go into town anyway. I tried walking,I tried biking, I physically couldn't make it after a few hours of still not arriving into town.

I gave up and resorted to sitting in my room, spending nearly every waking hour on Internet surveys making any money I could to save in the bank. I had a couple thousand dollars already given to me over the years growing up, but my dad (who my mom divorced and I didn't, and never would stay with) wouldn't sign the rights over to me. I was 18, the bank said without him signing it over, I couldn't gain access to my account until I was 21. He eventually signed it over out of desperation thinking it'd make me forgive him for years of abuse (I guess that's why?) and used that money to LEAVE.

Long story short, I ended up nearly homeless, lacking the resources to become independent so suddenly, and other family took me in.

A few months later, my family moves into civilization so I move back (because at my other family's it was a tiny podunk town and everyone started harassing me, so why the hell would I stay when I could leave and start over again?).

I had been having rage outbursts since around the time I was 18? They progressively got worse, until I got another medication added to my drug cocktail. That was this January, my rage was suppressed, I had no outbursts and at worst got annoyed instead of really angry. Until today.

My grandmother said because I criticized my mom for not being willing to drive me into town to try and get a job, I needed to move the fuck out right now. She said my (less than $10 an hour bottom level service job) savings were big (because apparently a few thousand dollars somehow overrules the fact that the money will drain into the negative soon without a STEADY SOURCE OF INCOME) and I could (magically?) afford an apartment or a room.

If I'm lucky enough to get 40 hours every week for a whole month, I barely scratch $1,200. The cheapest apartment I could find around is $850 a month. That would leave $350 a month left to spend, IF I actually got a full forty hours every week.

I started community college at the beginning of this year, but not completely sure of the major I chose, still full of uncertainty and directionless. I don't even know how school is going to go this year because of the c-virus (I don't know if I can say that here). 

If it remains completely online, that means continued struggle to stay focused, less chance to get out of this dysfunctional house, and continued isolation. Although even when I went to school, after years of bullying, abuse, and isolation, I was very to myself, didn't make any friends, too insecure about my life status to even try and make friends (24, still at home, haven't had a REAL, or even just decent job that wasn't temporary, don't have my driver license).

Some people would talk to me, and I'd talk, whether they talked to me first, or I did first . But no kind of friendship or anything developed. It regularly felt like going to campus instead of online (before online was made mandatory) was pointless for me, but it was still better than sitting at home, it was at least easier to focus, and I guess some social interaction was better than nothing?

I plan to continue this fall, even if it is just online, but still not too sure about my chosen major. I'm also now being severely pressured to move out way before I can even remotely support myself (yes, I know, I'm 24, part of this whole problem is my late start in life, and unfortunately no matter how late you start, there is no shortcut or quickstart).

My dad would come to practice driving with me (my mom can't because of a panic disorder, which I accept, and step dad is gone most of the time for work, like weeks at a time, and so far despite the not so long ago major abuse, he's been the best driving teacher for me) but the abuse never completely stopped, even after he sobered up. I can't deal with him, even my sister who is younger than me wants nothing to do with him anymore. He's an idiot, he can't comprehend why he's being ignored (or acts like he doesn't know why). 

His belittling comments never stopped, mocking me for being afraid of trying new medications, mocking me for just recently starting to learn how to drive (it was a huge deal for me), threatening to cut me off of his health insurance if I make him mad (he has to pay for my sister and let me stay on so far because his plan only requires him to pay for one child) and just being an unreasonable asshole.

So I'm down at least one person who I can practice driving with. But after today, it's possible my step dad will be mad at me again, and his rage is even worse than mine (and if mine was gone for awhile, and came back, even on medication that kept it away for the longest time, his can come back too) I will have NOBODY to practice with.

I'd still rather not have to drive, so I'll likely try to live around it, when I can live on my own, moving to a walking/transit friendly place, relying on Uber/Lyft. 

I GENERALLY feel a lack of reason to do anything without anyone forcing, or at least encouraging me to.

So the event today, was my grandmother (on the phone) telling me that BECAUSE I told my mom how I was still upset that years ago when I had no transportation, she refused to drive me so I could try and get a job and start making money, my grandmother told me that JUST BECAUSE OF THAT, I needed to IMMEDIATELY MOVE OUT, because I ""had a lot of nerve"" telling my mom ""that she was a terrible parent"" (I didn't say that).

Being stuck in that house 24/7 for a whole 2 years haunts me every day to this day, I am traumatized and have feared having to choose between going back to that or being homeless (which I also almost ended up when I tried to get out on my own) and I'm miserable and have severe mood swings EVERY DAY.

I get DISGUSTED with myself, I feel like I'm just incompatible with the entire female human race (back in grade school, I was constantly bullied and told how ugly I was, and I've been told that even more online when I had the balls to post a picture and ask how I look), I think about how if I end up homeless I want to immediately get a gun and shoot myself or jump off a building or run into a highway........

I have all kinds of disturbing thoughts, I rapidly swing between feeling ok, even hopeful, and depressed, angry.

I now know that I can still have rage outbursts on this medication, I guess my tolerance is just higher. But being told that I CHOSE to stay in my room and I was just lazy, when the truth is something that I'm haunted and traumatized by EVERY SINGLE DAY, I just lost it. I snapped. 

My vision went blurry (not blind, just blurry) I felt immediately taken over, worse than ever before, I punched stuff, not even thinking about doing it, and yelled at the top of my lungs, I think I sounded like a screeching animal. I felt nothing but pure rage just taking over me and controlling me for a minute or so, like a wild animal or something.

If this happened in public, or my grandparents were actually HERE when I blew up like that, I know I'd be in jail, and probably forced to undergo a psych evaluation. And then the doctors would want to give me more pills that would cause permanent dysfunctions like PSSD (already scared I'll get that when/if I get off of all the meds I'm on now) and treat me like a disobedient child for refusing to take them, I don't know if they can physically force yoy or not. But I'm already on medications that I've taken for many years, you can't just abruptly stop, probably even worse to do that AND ABRUPTLY START other medication, but I don't trust psych staff to give a shit. My psychiatrist just wants to pop me full of pills, disregarding non-psych meds I took that could cause interactions, that's just modern American psychitry, and hiding potential side effects, long-term risk or not....

I don't feel guilty of how I got today, I think my grandmother OWES ME an apology, and I'm now a little more worried that that rage is still inside of me, I literally can't control it, it's pretty terrifying, and obviously it can overpower medication that I was given to suppress that.

I don't want to go to prison, or a psych hospital, or to hurt anyone, I'm afraid one day I'll do something I majorly regret, and feel it is LITERALLY not me and LITERALLY out of my control.

As far as the girlfriend and sex thing, I know I'm in no position to worry about that right now, but as a 24 year old male virgin who's never had a girlfriend, it does really make me feel like shit. People like to act like it's abnormal to desire companionship and intimacy, and like being massively told how worthless and ugly I am shouldn't hurt me.

I also fear at the idea of having a girlfriend who pisses me off and the switch just flipping, and, you know.

I'm such a screwed up mess.

I wouldn't even have any reason to go on if I was homeless, I'd want to suicide right away, because I have absolutely nothing to live for if I end up homeless (and barely now).

She also said that I just sleep all day, despite previously acknowledging how I went to school (unclear how that’s going this fall because of that cv thing that I can’t say) and regularly work 30-40 hours a week, AND try to learn how to drive, but apparently suddenly I just sleep all day......",21Jul2020,1
215,"A few months before schools were closed in the UK, i managed to get into a good friendship group.  For the past 4 years (since year 8) id been with one girl mainly and i enjoyed it the first year but after that i regretted it all and felt as if i couldnt leave because id have nobody.  After ages i finally started sitting on a different table and everyone there is so nice and i just get on with them well and id known all of them at least slightly before that and had been best friends with a couple before i met the other girl.  But i still feel as if im not accepted and i feel simply tolerated.  Year 10 was such a dark year for me and when i opened up to one of the best friends i had since year 7 he just didnt seem to care at all and it kinda broke me.  Last week they were doing a socially distant meet up in one of their gardens and i didnt respond to the message until last minute because i felt like they didnt actually want me there and that it wasnt meant for me but responded as if they were happy about it.  But its not just by friends, its by family too.  I sometimes try to speak to my mum and she doesnt hear me at all because shes just on facebook or strava or whatever and i feel alone but shes not always like that it just stands out to me more when she does.

216,"I've literally hit rock bottom and I thought I hit rock bottom before. I managed to sever ties with about 4 people in the span of a month. Unfortunately, I struggled (and still do struggle) with anger issues, chronic anxiety, depression, insomnia due to perpetual rumination, obsessive compulsive disorder, borderline personality disorder, and....\*breathes in\* Body dysmorphic disorder. So, instead of being consistent with treatment I jumped from relationship to relationship (boyfriends). HORRIBLE DECISION. I lost countless nights of sleep worrying about not getting a text back and became super obsessive with my ""favorite person"" of the month. I used to be very attractive and hyperfocused but because I became OBSESSED with my Ex...I lost focus of what truly mattered, dropped out of school, and couldn't keep a job because I prioritized him first (crazy, I know). My immune system isn't the greatest now due to the stress and lack of sleep, I ruined other relationships, and I finally seen the light today: people, you DO NOT NEED A BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND TO BE HAPPY. And if you become obsessed with a dude you are dating, distance yourself from him! DO NOT DATE HIM. I'm serious. Both my ex and I had a tumultuous relationship. It was absurd and a colossal waste of time.  I hope I can recover from my disorders through therapy and develop strong relationships with other people. On top of that I wasn't kind to my family and close friends. I regret my behaviors. But there's no future in dwelling in the past. Just got to move forward and never neglect therapy. ALSO, I tended to engage in behaviors such as oversharing (with friends and acquaintances). 

If you are struggling with your mental health and believe me I am too. You are not alone. Together, we can change for the better. Also, I suffered with love-addiction and fear of abandoment. The harsh reality I came across today was that I am better off alone (at least for now and for a long time). I feel like I'm too unstable and not pretty enough for romance at the moment. But that's a harsh reality I need to come to terms with. The loss of beauty and potential and money due to becoming obsessed with somebody and having mental health issues. Treating other people poorly, especially family members...This is my karma. But now I am choosing to be kind, be consistent with therapy and treat others with the respect they deserve.",21Jul2020,1

I'm not gonna go into detail about it but the worst thing about it is that I don't have a reason to be anxious. My friend doesn't care about it anymore because they were wrong, she's gotten no hate and only support, which is good, but it's still effecting me quite a bit. I think it's because I associate with and support this person is what's causing the anxiety. But it's hard for me to stop dwelling on things and I just feel so tired from all the anxiety from what was said about them and what some people think about our friend circle. I think it's that I'm trying so hard to empathize with both sides of the situation that it's taking a toll on me. But another thing that's frustrating is that all the """"drama""""is already done and there's nothing we can do about cause my friends done all she can to defend herself and so have I.

I'm tired all day, I just want to sleep, and I barely want to eat anything and my family gets a bit worried cause I'm never like that. This is the third time I'm going through this involving the same people having to do with the same petty thing: differing opinions.(except last time it was worse cause it felt like physical pain and I couldn't be happy about anything)

This is also in a fandom so I usually use the series I love as a bit of comfort when I'm in a bad mood but now I can't even do that cause it's hard for me to love it without thinking of their bullshit and it's kinda ruined for me for now. And that really fucking sucks. I feel sick and want to cry.

 I don't know what else to do, when I'm in this state it's something I just have to wait out until it completely goes away which takes about a week. I am taking a break from tumblr obviously (and I've even thought about deleting it) but I don't want to be alone with my thoughts and feelings and I'm just trying to figure them out and wait for them to go away.

Anyways.. I quit drinking in January, (6 months and change sober!) and have been really struggling with suicidal thoughts and anxiety the last few months. I think the alcohol was numbing it and being sober is just shining a spotlight on the issue. Today I went to the dr to see about getting some kind of medication because I can't keep living like this. As the nurse was doing the depression screening one of the questions was ""Do you have thoughts of self harm or negative thoughts towards yourself and if so how often"", I answered truthfully ""yes, everyday"". The nurse put the clipboard down and said, 'wow, I'm so surprised by that. You look so beautiful and put together"". I felt so gaslighted. idk if that's even the right term. Like you can't look at me and tell I'm depressed?? that's not how it works man. The Dr herself was really nice, and it's fine.. I just needed to vent.

I (21f) who should be independent already and isn’t. I’ve had this horrid undiagnosed mindset since high school ended I think. And I though recently, enough is enough. I need help. So I researched for a psychiatrist or a therapist or something but they are so expensive in Japan. Costs like about $200 dollars for a single appointment.  I can’t afford it nor can I ask my parents. My dad recently had a stroke and he went to the icu and everything. I don’t want to be even more of a burden. Then I just thought. If I wasn’t born then my parents would have lived a much better life. With the dog, they could have lived without having to spend so much money wasting it to give me education overseas. I’m such a ducking waste of space and money that could have been saved for their retirement. And if I were to die I’d be even more of a waste of money. Then I started crying.

Lalli was 15 years and 6 moths old, he was my best friend and when i say it i truly mean it. 

2 days ago i wake up in the morning and my mom tells me that Lalli hasnt eaten any food in the entire night and i should go check up on him. i go downstairs and see that he is just laying down on the ground and being very apathetic, concerned i demand that we take him to the vet and at the vet they told us that Lalli had a massive tumor in his stomach, and that there is a surgery they could try but it is expensive and there is such a little chance that he would survive the surgery that we would have to sign a paper that they can euthanise him if the surgery wont work. 

my parents made the choice that we will euthanise Lalli so he wouldnt be in any pain anymore.

i watched my cat my best friend die in my arms, and it has been the worst thing ever to happen to me ever. 

i have been crying nonstop 2days and i cant even be in my house, because everything reminds me of him in someway, Lalli was so close to me compared to my family and i have noticed that i cared so much more about him than my family.

he was my best friend, he always was there for me and he used to spend all his time in my room with me. there was a time that i didnt have any friends and Lalli was my only friend. He never left me alone and always showed me affection and love, like i showed him.

im feeling so depressed right now and i dont mean it lightely, i have lost all motivation to everything and only thing that lets me feel better even a little bit, is alcohol. im feeling so lonely and empty inside, no one seems to understand how much in pain im in right now, not even my family. i feel like i just want to scream and never stop. i have tried everything to try to stay positive but i just cant. 

i dont know what to do anymore, i cant go literally to my room without bursting in to tears and crying for the next 30minutes, i dont sleep at nights and i spend all my time on the livingroom couch, because thats the place Lalli spent the least time. 

i post this because i need help but i dont want to ask my parents to book me a therapist, because they would overreact, i just want to get rid of this pain, loneliness and emptiness inside me. 

i have also started feeling guilt when i think about the times that i have played my ps4 and Lalli comes next to me wanting me to pet him, but i have refused to. 

i took him for granted and now i would do anything to spend even a minute with him. I would give him so much love and made sure that he would now how much i really love him and miss him.

237,"I have lived with depression and anxiety my whole life (28 year old nonbinary). Last night was the first time that I can recall having a dream where I'm in a very depressed mood. In my dream I was explaining to my family members about how alone I feel, how I feel useless, and that I should just die. When I was explaining these things to them it's as if they were not listening nor did they care making me feel more alone in my dream.   


Needless to say, the dream messed up my mental health today. I feel depressed, alone, and also panicky due to the fact that my thoughts created that dream. It's something I haven't experienced before and I didn't know who else to tell.

He hasn't left our house since early may and he doesn't plan to leave our house till the pandemic is over. With his social anxiety he has always preferred to stay home and not interact with people, but I'm worried that if he doesn't get any social interaction he will be severely affected by the end of the pandemic. My family has tried to get him to at least leave our house for a bit, but he just gets mad at us and now rarely talks to any of us. He is paranoid about getting infected even though we live in a smaller city in Canada that doesn't have very many cases. I'm wondering how I should go about helping him. The pandemic clearly won't be over soon so I don't really want him to stay hiding away for months to come.

240,"Hi everyone,

So I've lived in my house for around 14 years now and the next door neighbour has always been odd. His wife is nice and she talks a lot, but this guy, something just seems... Off, he never talks, just stares. The only time he has talked to me is when he told me this creepy story of being chased by a man, when he was my age, in a local park to us. 
Since moving in as a child, I got it into my head that he has a ""spying"" hole in the bathroom. Their bathroom is right next door to ours, and I can hear them when they're showing or even just walking around etc. I don't know why I thought this, I've checked many, many times and can't find anything. We have even had the bathroom changed twice and the builders/plumbers never said anything,surely they would?
But I just can't get this out of my head and I don't know why - something as specific as a small peeping hole he can watch us through? I've thought it since being a child, since before I had anything ""wrong"" with my mental health.",21Jul2020,1

245,"Hey everyone, I was looking to see if anyone had any advice on finding a professional to speak to. I really don’t even know where to start with finding someone. I don’t know if I need a therapist, psychiatrist, behavior specialist, etc. I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety for years but always dealt with it on my own. I think I’ve developed pretty severe OCD/phobia of bugs from a past apartment that was infested on move in day. Since then I’ve had an outright phobia of bugs inside my home. I moved to a new apartment in November and it’s been great. It’s summer in the south and of course bugs are coming in but I just got over an infestation I caused by leaving potting soil outside. Now I somehow have 50 spiders a day. I think maintenance disrupted them when they were going through the attic space to the ceiling to repair my AC because that’s when they came. I feel like I have no sense of reality or even time anymore. I spend my days obsessing over searching for bugs in my apartment. I deep clean every day even though there’s nothing left to clean. I obsessively count the number of bugs I find and get worried/upset if I think I miscounted. The recent spiders are making my anxiety and depression worse and it’s to the point I don’t have much of an appetite anymore. I’m proud of myself for just taking my dog for a long walk. Other than that I wait for night to come so I can go to bed and be done with the day. Even when I go to bed I’m anxious and scared of bugs being near my bed or in my bedroom. 

So, I need to talk to someone about a lot of issues including depression and an anxiety. But I think the bug phobia and possible OCD is the most pressing matter. What kind of professional do I seek for this? I’ve been dragging my feet all summer because I’m embarrassed to have to seek professional help for something like this. It’s exhausting though and I can’t continue living like this.",21Jul2020,1
246,"I’ve struggled with depression a lot in the past, this is true. I’m 20 and I had a LOT of depression as a teenager. I only recently got out of that mentality in the last year or so. Recently I quit my shitty job that only paid 8.25 an hour because I want to make more money, and find a tech job considering that’s what I love. I would like to go to college too, but unfortunately with COVID nothing is open. I’ve been really struggling to find a job, and having a felony on my record doesn’t make it any easier. (I got in a dumb fight awhile back). 

I was fine for the first couple of weeks but I would say about a week ago is when I started to come down. I’ve been angry, sad, I’ve basically lost all motivation to even look for a job, or to call any psychologists like I’m supposed to be doing (court order). Not to mention I treat my girlfriend like fucking shit and verbally lash out on her over dumb shit. We haven’t had a very good relationship recently and with work and me, I’ve been stressing her out a lot. She’s definitely been less sweet and active recently. I’ve felt like we’ve grown apart and honestly, I’m worried. 

I don’t want to lose her and I know something is wrong. I haven’t been depressed in so long so I kind of forgot what that was like. Is this it? Am I depressed? I don’t even know anymore.

248," Hello! My problem is pretty much described in the title. Overall, I am satisfied with myself. I mean, I am proud of what I have done until now and I am satisfied that I have the will and determination to evolve and become a better person every day. I am doing well in the professional life (university) until now and I'm ready to work hard in order to maintain my success. I have some great hobbies and passions and I'm glad that I have the possibility to practice them and learn more things about what interests me. When I am with my friends, I am quite confident and I feel good about myself. So, overall, I am a happy individual I could say. (apart from the stress and some insecurities/fear of the unknown)

However, there are times when I just feel inferior to other people for no reason. I mean, today I messaged a girl for the first time (we were aquainted, but didn't know each other very well), but she was not so eager to talk to me. Well, it could be because she was in a holiday at the seaside, so I can understand. I don't feel bad or sad because of that, but here is the problem: I saw a instagram story with her and some of her friends and there was a guy (which is considered a cool guy overall. He is quite known among people my age). I know he isn't her boyfriend or something like that, but I just felt inferior in that moment. I thought something like: ""Wow, she went in a holiday with that cool dude. He must be better than me in some way"". I know that it isn't really true. Just because he is popular or taller or looks better, it doesn't mean that he's better than me. But I just get anxious and feel inferior. I was wondering if you guys could help me with some advice to get rid of this ""toxic habit"".

PS: This is not the only situation that my feeling of inferiority appears. Another example is: if I hear one of my colleagues (who is considered cool among students) opinion and if he uses fancy words or has a really sofisticated opinion, I just feel like he's better than me. I feel like my opinion would be ""worse"" than his somehow. It's an awful feeling because, like I said, I am proud of myself overall, but I often have trouble believing in myself.

249,"Hi Guys,

Could really use some advice or point me in the right direction. 

Without going into a whole thing, I’ve realized I really need to be more constructive with my free time. Being in a new city, I really do not have any social outlets besides work. Although they are nice people there, I would like to have other social circles besides just the people I work with. Especially since I’m a manager. 

While I think getting into new hobbies would be best, I also feel I am very unmotivated to do so. Like sure I can list off ten things I can give a try, I’m not necessarily “excited” to try them. Like I’m doing it just to say I have a hobby rather than really “wanting” to do it. I don’t know if that makes sense. 

I dunno. It’s just easier just to stay home everyday. Trying new things really “ups” my social anxiety and fear of rejection I guess. I work in hotels and it bums me out to see some of the best moments of so many people - friends getting together, couples celebrating a milestone, people going to theme parks or whatever - and I just find myself so envious of them and wish I can insert myself into those moments. 

It’s a struggle to open myself up and put myself out there. Would like to work on this but don’t know where to really start. 

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.",21Jul2020,1

252,"Hello, everyone. I am not exactly sure why am I writing this post, I am probably just looking to vent or receive some thoughts of encouragement.

Long story short, I went from being suicidal and attempting a few times to fearing death to a point where now I have death anxiety. I am a 22M so having to deal with such anxiety at such a young age is quite, well, annoying. Now, don't get me wrong, depression is an awful thing and so is anxiety, but I'd much prefer wishing to be dead and keep on living rather than fear death constantly. Is anyone else going through this? I used to be such a nihilistic individual, I was proud of my understanding that life is finite and meaningless, but look at me now, fearing death more than anything. I have crippling and intrusive thought about it and no idea how to handle them. 

I am also quite a rational thinker, so telling myself facts like everyone dies in the end is not really helping. I realize all aspects of death and logically comprehend it - that's probably why I can't fool myself into not fearing it. It's like  knowing that placebo is just placebo, that's how I feel about most solutions for death anxiety. Oh, the irony, considering myself a rational thinker, yet dealing with an irrational fear of death.

256,"I really liked it! Firstly, there were only 7 people there including myself, and secondly, I had actually been in prison with two of the ladies in the group! We talked about being in prison and read out of the AA Big Book, so it was a LOT like an AA meeting, without the Serenity Prayer and the reading of all that stuff in the beginning of the meeting. I only have to go ONE day a week (Tuesdays) which we found out is the shorter group (only 2 hours long instead of 3 hours) and I go for individual counseling once every other week.   


My Probation Officer is a cunt (I told you guys that the level of alcohol in my blood was 0.3-something), which is indicative of an outside source and not by ingesting alcohol. I would have had a MUCH higher concentration in my blood if I had been drinking, believe me. I don't drink just a tiny tiny bit usually (the tasting of my hubby's drink on his birthday was a big exception and that is only because I AM on Probation and because I really DO want to stay sober)...in the past if I were going to drink, I would drink to get plastered beyond all rational thought. Heh. I have to call the court every single morning to see if my COLOR is being called, and if it is (I am Pink--how apropos) I have to go get tested. This is only temporary and I won't be using my inhaler anymore because it has ethanol in it. I don't want to risk it.   


So, anyway, I like the group and at least I know a couple of the people there. That makes me feel better. The one lady even remembered my nickname, Pyro. Hmmm. Yeah, those were crazy times in prison, that is for sure. We swapped stories of the one bat-shit crazy inmate who kept getting thrown in the Hole. We both had experiences with her. Amusing at times, annoying when you finally had fallen asleep and she started to bang on her cell door and yell obscenities. At no one in particular.

258,"I really care about the people who I let into my life. I am supportive, empathetic, caring, selfless, and incredibly loyal. And I realize that very very few people are like that, so I put a limit on my expectations. All I ask for in return is appreciation, acknowledgment, and respect. When I give someone a place in my life, I also give them the power to hurt me. And I feel like they keep doing it, maybe because they're unaware of that power.

When any kind of relationship come to an end, I make sure I handle it with class and grace, no matter how deeply hurt I am, or how tempting it is to pour out all the rage I have inside me onto that person, for the way they've failed to see everything I've done for them; all the love, support, patience, honesty, acceptance. I do think it's better to part ways on a good note, and deal with inner struggles on my own.

The other day, someone who has lied to me and hurt me, who I've cut all ties with 2 months ago, reached out to me again and wanted to get back into my life. I got a really huge ego boost out of it, and felt so powerful. I have the power to reject and hurt them now, the same way they did to me. And I love it.

But then I started asking myself, why? Why does something like this bring me satisfaction and boost my self-esteem? That can't be a good thing. It must mean that there's something missing, a self-issue that needs to be resolved. It's not healthy to use scenarios like these - which have happened to me multiple times before, and I've dealt with them the same way - to feel better about myself.

I think forgiveness might be a way to avoid this kind of situation. But I don't know how to forgive. I try really hard, and I honestly end up believing that I've truly forgiven.

259,"Like many people in this sub, I (22F) have struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a kid. I had intense obsessions and rituals throughout my childhood (some of these included not being able to leave my house without all the toys I owned, irrational fear of losing a limb, had to get up on a certain side of the bed). I’ve taken medication and gone to therapy since I was 12, because that’s when I began self-harming. Early high school resulted in many tumultuous friendships and relationship. In late high school I matured a lot, was much happier and learned to respond to things in healthier ways. But after I graduated, I went off my meds (huge mistake) which made me emotional, paranoid and my sex drive was gone. Though things managed to get better, but I still struggled with intense anxiety and anger, eventually becoming extremely depressed again during my junior year of college. That was the point in which I went back on my meds. The meds do make me not depressed or as agitated which is good, but I still struggle with anxiety and anger, which has put a significant strain on my relationships. My former roommate and close friend at one point compared me to her mother, a woman who struggled with BPD and eventually committed suicide. For the past 7 months, I’ve struggled to eat due to a fear of choking and an automatic urge to cough everything back up. Many other friends and acquaintances have recently described me as cold and mean, which hurts. I’ve started seeing a neuropsychologist today, but still have no idea what is wrong with me. It’s  been suggested that it’s autism, bipolar, OCD but I don’t seem to fit all the symptoms for any of these. Yet I can’t shake the feeling that there is something off, something more than just anxiety. I can’t help but feel hopeless. I feel that every teacher, counselor, and authority figure who should have helped me let me down. I’m tired of hearing people tell me to “work on myself” as if I haven’t been doing that my entire damn life. 

TL; DR: I’ve struggled with my mental health my whole life and it’s killing that I don’t have an inkling as to what’s wrong.

It is currently 12:07am, two hours ago, I remembered a movie I watched once when I was in middle school that involves the theme of suicide and depression, which ends up with the main character dying from suicide. There was such a big difference between watching it then and now. Even though I was depressed and suicidal back then too, my understanding of my situation has gotten better over time. To understand the motives of the characters, their backstories, their lifestyle, the changes they’re going through, is fascinating. I feel at ease. After I finished watching the movie, I got up and went to brush my teeth and wash my face. I felt this sort of feeling that you feel when you go on a vacation in a foreign country, specifically a European one. My sister was going out and was wearing a perfume that reminds me of the perfume my mother used to take with her when we went on vacations. She went into the bathroom to wash her hands and all of a sudden , while I was brushing my teeth, I felt this sort of light heartiness and then laughed about our height, but not in a mean way, and said it’s so strange there’s people who are taller than us. Then I went in her room and looked in the mirror, I didn’t look that terrible to myself. My weight did not matter, nor did my lips or my terrible hair. I wonder what sort of feeling this is. I’m very glad I watched this movie again. I hope this feeling can last some time now . It has been a while since I felt truly alright and it wasn’t the mood swings :)

273,"Am I the only one who has come across this? It seems to me that therapists love the sound of their own voices, and I am tired of it

Yesterday, i had an appointment with a new therapist. It was our second appointment, and in the first appointment I'd told her that I was tired of therapists who just talk and talk at you, without giving you space to talk. She gave me 3 minutes to 'share'. I said that i would like some space to talk, that i would like some space to be able to discuss current and past struggles. Not to vent, but to be given space to discuss things

She then went on a 10 minute rant on how my sharing is not good for therapy, that it takes up all the time in a session, that perhaps if I wanted just to share, then I'm not ready for therapy, that I can share with my psychiatrist, that all I wanted to do was 'chat' then she explained the therapeutic relationship as though I were a child. 

She didn't once acknowledge what I said, she didn't reflect what I said back to me, she didn't check that she had understood correctly, she just barreled on without stopping

After telling me that I was in control of the sessions, and that the therapeutic relationship is a two way street,  she basically was telling me that I had no control, and that she was the only authority in the room

I then told her I didn't think we were a good fit, that she was doing exactly what I said other therapists had done, that she had misunderstood what i had said, that she hadn't even taken a breath to allow me to refute what she was saying, and then I hung up

I have been through so many therapists like this, whether they are a psychologist, counsellors, or social workers. Don't they teach empathy and listening skills anymore?",21Jul2020,2
274,"I (34F) just need to put this all out there because honestly it’s just starting to all weigh a bit too much. 

TLDR: I’m feeling badly for myself because I feel like every time I put out one fire there is another one just waiting to spark.

It started in December. A friend of mine was killed, ridding her bike by a drunk driver. 
I barely had time to process because I had to leave for three weeks of work travel (which was very stressful) in January. 

During the trip, I’m told my grandfather has passed away.

I come home and my long distance partner tells me that “this was the best relationship he had ever been in, but he needed something (that he could not specify?) that I would not be able to give him, ever.” We decide to stay together until we could see each other again because there was still so much love. (I thought things were going well up to this point, clearly mistaken)...

My upstairs neighbor and landlord whom I’ve shared a home with for 2 years, dies at the end of January

Then comes a March, and Covid. But before covid, I was run off the highway going 75 mph by a reckless driver. Overall the accident was as minor as can be for that speed, but I suffered physical injuries in my shoulder and a concussion.

Then, I was exposed to the ol’ Rona through work and started quarantine 3/13 (I never got it, or was asymptotic) This caused a huge fight between a close friend as I was missing a celebration for her masters degree, which caused enormous stress for me. 
March and April were a stress ball of reading too much news and the uncertainty of the world. I don’t live near my family which also was stressful to be apart. 

In April, a friend of the group kills himself. 

In May I am tasked to present what was supposed to be a 4 day, in person, international sales meeting which suddenly needed to be virtually hosted and that fell on me to put together entirely. (It went well but after many hours of stressing on my end)

I realize Covid isn’t going anywhere and the dude and I break up. 

I get a cat. (This is the best part of the story. His name is Rio and he is perfect)

At the end of May, I go to the doctor because I’m still having lots of headaches, dizziness and my hair is falling out. 
They find I have an arrhythmia that needs a follow up. 
Then the MRIs get get ordered. 
I spend 4 weeks in and out of specialist and scans, they find nothing. 

My kitten starts to have a stuffy nose, and blinky eyes. I bring him in, they do 300$ worth of tests to find nothing. He still has symptoms. 

So at this point I am getting ready and excited for an outdoor river trip in my state that had been planned for a year....Then my parents call. 

My dad is not doing well. Likely MS and/or Alzheimer’s. He is coming to visit. This is not negotiable. He is coming before his doctors appointments. Which you guessed it, is right when my trip is. Well, a week after but due to his health, I didn’t feel comfortable going, while my state was spiking in cases, with no way to tell if I was a carrier before seeing him. My trip gets canceled, everyone else goes. 

The family comes to visit and I realize just how bad my dad’s memory is. He forgot I was there, he doesn’t know the year, or where he lives. 

This isn’t to mention George Floyd and that I used to live in MPLS and watched my old community burn down, my friends protest and end up in the hospital. Every time I read the news, I feel helpless, our government is keeping covid data from the cdc, that we have unmarked special forces kidnapping people for acting on their constitutional rights, or that we are having virtual meetings because it is too dangerous to meet Ib person,to discuss trying to send kids back to school in a few weeks.
 

I’m in therapy, have a job and a home, didn’t lose every and have a lot of support but I still feel like I’m losing my grip and am seeing myself shutting everyone out because somehow it just feels like to much to put on anyone else because everyone I talk to is in a seemingly similar place. 

I feel like I live in a constant state of anxiety, depression, hope and mourning and it just depends on what day you catch me.

275,"Hi! Im just curious of other people's opinions on this topic. Hopefully this is the right group to ask if not please tell me and I'll delete. 

Trigger warning: medication mention (just in case) 

So! I have dabbled with the idea of taking some sort of medication to help with my anxiety and mild depression. In the past couple of years I have tried to develop a healthier lifestyle and im very cautious with what I put on and in my body for many reasons. With that though, I dont take very many pharmaceuticals, just migraine meds and otc pain relief for migraines. Due to the possible side affects. potential long term affects, other medical conditions, and bad past experiences. 

My question is. Why is it that when I tell people I don't want to take medication it turns into an arguement and im always seen as a douche? I am not saying or implying that I dont believe in meds or that they can't be helpful to people. Im simply saying that I have found other ways to help with my mental health and I dont want to take them. Why is that a bad thing? I'm really not trying to offend anyone.",21Jul2020,1
276,"
My doctor first told me to take 10mg up to 3x a day but that didn’t work so she gave me a 40mg to take once a day but it still doesn’t work so I looked up the maximum amount you can take before you overdoes which was 240mg so I started taking more and depending on how anxious I am I only feel a dent when I take between 110 and 140mg 


It doesn’t even really work properly...

I’m not sure what to do because I know my doctor will be angry I took more that she specifically told me to take and if I say it doesn’t work she will put me on a slightly higher does like 80mg a day... which already didn’t work

277,"Hello. 

I'd go to relationship advice sub, but I think this is a better sub. My wife (for almost a year) has some mental health problems. She gets high levels of anxiety and depression, and just feels awful. It's happened before and what she always says she needs is just space and time alone. This time it is lasting longer though, over a few months.
In the first year of our relationship, she mentioned to me that one year prior, it felt like the joy had been surgically removed from her life and since meeting me, my energy and happiness made her whole again. 
We've been together 4 years now, and I don't know what to do. I love her more than anything, but she's not reciprocating (I know it's because she's sad), but it's hard. All I want to do is help her, but especially during this pandemic she's all I have. The more I distance myself the more it hurts, but I want her to heal so maybe I should just deal with the pain of it now.
Edit: she does see a therapist once a week, and has been for years.",21Jul2020,1

280,"Okay, this is something that has been playing on my mind for a while now, and i'm not sure if this relates to maladaptive daydreaming or not, but I would really appreciate a reply from someone who feels like they can relate to what I'm describing: Ever since I was a kid, I have been talking to myself and imagining situations that I know would NEVER happen. They are all fictional, like from a movie, tv show, game, book, anything like that. Sometimes I even recite a speech from a YouTuber that was spoken in a video, and then sort of put myself in the shoes of that person, recite the whole speech out loud to myself and imagine it's me that's actually experiencing it.  I did have imaginary friends growing up, but when I was a teenager it sort of died down and became what I just described. When I talk to myself, imagining I'm in these fictional scenarios, I will literally get so immersed in them that I sometimes do it in public, though thank God i don't really get any funny looks from people lol. Also when I'm talking to myself/imagining, i play the part of the other person as well as my own, like i will say my part out loud and sometimes say the part of the other person too. Other times, I will simply picture the other person's part in my head and say my own part out loud. I used to act it out a lot more when I was a kid and at school, it's died down quite a lot now, but it's a habit that's still with me. I never ever thought that I could be schizophrenic because even though I do get so immersed in these ""daydreams"", or whatever you want to call them, at the same time I do realise that they're not real, and simply stem from a habit that i've ever had ever since I was a really young girl (I'm 27 now). I will also repeat lines that I like from YouTube videos, movies, games, books etc etc etc imagining that I am in the person-that's-doing-its shoes, which is pretty much exactly the same as what I just described I guess but thought it would be useful to put down here anyway. I get that everyone talks to themselves to a certain degree, and I don't have any doubt that when some people read this they will immediately jump to conclusions and just assume it's me thinking out loud to myself (for example ""where did I put my keys/phone/bag?"") which i still do, granted, the same way everyone does. But I wanted to put this out there, in hopes that someone will see it and say that they do the same thing. Also, in case anyone is wondering, absolutely NONE of this has stemmed from any trauma or anything like that, i mean I have gone through some rough patches but rest assured they didn't trigger any of this lol. I had a very good childhood, not the best time at school as a teenager but that's another story, (but the talking-to-self thing had started years before any of that anyway), again, it's just been a habit of mine that I've had since I was a child. But, reinstated, I would be so grateful if someone (ANYONE) could read this and say they do the exact same thing, as it would be very reassuring for me. Also, my daydreams (if you can call them that) don't affect my life negatively in any way at all, and they never have done. Because I still find myself chattering to myself even when I'm doing housework or anything important, so that's why I was confused as to whether they count as daydreams (they might still do but not be classed as maladaptive ones). I hope this does not mean that I could be schizophrenic or have a multiple personality disorder or anything like that, I think it's just force of habit because it seems to ""follow me everywhere"", but at least it doesn't affect my life negatively?",21Jul2020,6
281,"I keep getting this wave of utter dread and fear every single night for the past week, as soon as I put my phone down to go to sleep and it feels like an emotional punch in the gut. I just think about how much I love my bunnies and my cat and I literally cannot deal with the fact that they will eventually cease to exist. Then, I start thinking of a very important person in my life who very suddenly passed away (my boss, who was like a father to me) and how much I loved him and how I never got to tell him exactly how much he meant to me. 

Not to bring up religion, but I feel like it’s essential to explain my beliefs for this particular problem because it may explain why this is happening. In a nutshell, I believe in an eventual paradise on earth where people will be resurrected to live as Adam and Eve were supposed to, so I tried to find out if pets would be resurrected too and there are multiple scriptures basically saying that only humans can qualify. 

When I first read it, literally within a split second, my whole body went numb and my face got hot and I felt the type of panic you would have if you had just tripped off the side of a cliff. I have always relied on my religion for comfort when I would have existential dread or worry, but this time, I couldn’t. I felt absolutely devastated, like my whole world had just fallen apart.  I wanted to cry but instead of tears releasing my pain, I just felt all of it build up in my stomach, chest and throat. Ever since then, I have had the same experience every single night, right as I try going to sleep and sometimes in short spurts throughout the day. 

I just want it to stop so bad. I can’t even describe how painful this type of anxiety attack is. I’ve had anxiety attacks since 4th grade when I overheard my teacher saying that there was a tornado warning in our area (and this was before I had ever heard of anxiety, so I thought I was literally dying) and since then, I’ve probably had hundreds of them. I also have adhd so I have problems with really intense, uncontrollable emotions. 

My previous anxiety attacks have always felt like complete panic and terror and the physical symptoms were always hyperventilating, crying, numbness in face and extremities, lightheadedness and shaking. The only part of it that’s the same as my new attacks is the lump in my throat, but the normal one is more of a panic lump and the new one feels more like a despair, existential panic lump if that makes sense. 

But the anxiety attacks I’ve been having recently have been something Ive only felt a handful of times in my life, mostly when I deeply think about either my own mortality / the mortality of my mom or when I lose somebody I really loved to something other than death. Usually, in those situations, I can control it. But in this situation it’s almost like I’m completely possessed by a cloud of grief and I can’t do anything to help myself. 

It’s like a complete wave over my body, a lot like how it feels when acid hits you or if you do something really embarrassing in front of a whole bunch of people, but in a very, very terrible way. I can feel my heart rate skyrocket right off the bat. Rather than the usual crescendo, which was kind of like flooring it in a brand new car, it’s more like my heart skipped to the last gear in the worlds fastest manual car and went 0-100 in .5 seconds. My entire body goes numb and gets hot, rather than just my hands and face. I almost feel like I want to curl up into a ball and dig my hands into my arms and squeeze my muscles and bones inside my body from feelings of wishing I was dead and just simply not knowing what to do with all my pain. But all I ever do is lay there in the pitch black, experiencing all of these things. If somebody walked into the room and saw me, they would probably think I look catatonic or hypnotized. 

My boyfriend sleeps next to me every night, but he always falls asleep before me so I never want to wake him up to help me and my mom is always asleep too. Even though I know I could wake one of them up and they would help me without a second thought, I just can’t bring myself to move at all. Then, by the time the next day rolls around, I stop thinking about it so I don’t even want to start thinking about it again in order to tell somebody because the experience sucks that much. If I have a normal anxiety attack, as soon as it passes, I always tell my mom and boyfriend. 

I’ve never lost somebody so important to me before and I’ve never had my religion let me down like that instead of giving me hope. 

I feel hopeless and lost and terrified and sad and grief stricken all at the same time. I’ve felt kind of like this before, but it’s so intense now, I just can’t handle it. I’m usually a strong person who can move on from things very fast, but I feel like I’m stuck in a pit of thick tar and im just using all my strength to slowly wade through and never really getting anywhere. 

Is this even an anxiety attack? Is it depression? What is wrong with me? Has anybody else ever experienced this? How can I make it stop? I really can’t continue feeling like this anymore.",21Jul2020,3
282,"I feel bad for Kanye West

To begin, I’ll admit I’ve never really been a big fan of his music. Some songs here and there, plus a couple features. But this has very little to do with the music. The guy has been wrapped up in a crazy life of fame. I don’t know what it’s like being that famous, but I have to imagine it can become more than overwhelming. 

His method to keep the attention on him is what makes it happen. I think he’s addicted to fame in a major way. He acts controversial and says controversial things to keep the camera on him. The classic “no publicity is bad publicity” tactic, which in a neutral way is true. Then he married Kim Kardashian, who clearly needs no introduction. 

Now the real big thing is he’s allegedly running for president, which is something at one point many people would have found ridiculous. Trump being elected proved even someone with zero political background can make it to the top, and I think this is why West and Trump get along so well. They both thrive off the controversy they create. 

I do not support Kanye West running for president, but I do respect the determination he has. The man already held a political rally and everything, but in it I saw what truly made me feel for him.

It’s my opinion that Kanye West probably has a mental disorder, though I have no idea what kind. But the breakdowns he has compared to what he’s surrounded by all the time is like the perfect mix of mentally-destroying items that will eventually consume a person. Now Kim Kardashian allegedly threatened to lock him up and divorce him (though I’m not sure why). He claimed the movie Get Out was about him. 

Everything considered (and I’m sure there’s so much I’ve never even heard of) I think the man is in so deep that it doesn’t matter what he thinks or feels. He’s just being ran into the ground by the people around him, and the Hollywood elites that control him. 

I should also say that I don’t judge the guy at all. He’s a man that even though I don’t like his music much, I’d love to know him as a person. Mostly so I can pick his brain and get his own opinion and views on things, without the pressure or biased influence of the media around him.",21Jul2020,0

I'm specifically talking about Facebook. I signed up several years ago, and I've made lots of friends who I deeply care about. I've grown quite popular in many wildlife groups, where I'm the ""bug expert"" as I'm into insects (specifically bees, wasps and the like) and I've probably saved thousands of them by convincing people that they're not a threat. 
Every day people ask me for advice about how to deal with the wasp nest that they found in their garden, or the bees that colonized their roof, this sort of problems. 

I've come to a point where I'm mentioned several times a day to deal with posts about insects, even in unrelated groups, where comments are mostly ""kill them with fire"" and flames are almost always guaranteed. 

I've come to a point that even opening a notification gives me anxiety, because most of the time there's a flame going on and people will be rude to me and I'll be rude to them or to people in real life and that makes me feel like shit. 
The situation has become so toxic that I occasionally take 1 week breaks where I log off and focus on other stuff. Then one week later I log in again out of curiosity and find dozens of notifications, most of which from people mentioning me or sending me PM's asking the same questions and making the same arguments over and over. 

I've seriously been thinking of deleting myself from Facebook lately, but on the other hand I like educating people about my field and I run groups and pages where hundreds of people can't wait for my informative posts. I don't want to lose them, or let uneducated people kill harmless bugs because there's no one to tell them that they're harmless.

He is on a few meds that a psychiatrist prescribed to him, Zoloft and aripiprazole are two of them. The psychiatrist doesn’t spend a lot of time talking too him just prescribed. 

My husband is very obsessive compulsive and has strange rituals (like knocking three times on a door before passing, just a silly example of something small) but will get very upset if a ritual is broken. Before the meds he was always loosing his mind, was arrested and spent some time in hospital on a 72 hour watch. The last incident where I threatened to leave was a road range where a guy cut him off and when we got to a red light he dragged the guy out of his car dumped his large drink on his head and started punching him in the middle of the intersection. My 3 year old saw and was terrified. 

He has also lost jobs over violent behaviour. Now that he is on the meds he’s fine, gone from extreme rage and hyperactivity to just hyperactivity, singing the same long lyrics over and over again loudly sometimes for 2 hours straight and just driving me insane and getting our 4 year old all spun out of control.
