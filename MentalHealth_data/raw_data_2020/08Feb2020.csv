0,"Hey guys, I’m dealing with a depression, and I know that it stems from a lack of confidence and self esteem. I honestly don’t really know what I can do to boost it. Thinking positive and other likewise advice haven’t really worked for me. I’m trying my best to do good things for myself, but i don’t feel like it’s paying off. 
Specially in social situations, I’m still as shy, awkward and silent, and I’m to afraid to speak my mind.

Do you have any tips for me? How did you boost your confidence and self belief?",08Feb2020,1
1,"Hello. To give a little background: During last summer, after two years of difficult and stressful events I went to the metro and suddenly I felt like I got a heart attack. My heart was pumping two times faster then normal and everything around started to fading. I had to leave a train and calm down myself. I was wandering around a metro station for a next 30 minutes semi conscious and finally I gathered my whole strength to get back there and took a ride home. Where I fell asleep and stuck in my bed for a next two days. After that things went slowly better and I deluded myself maybe I was just exhausted due very bad sleeping patterns and too much coffee/cigarettes. However few months after the same thing occured but much stronger. Now I was basically traped in my house. For the next weeks every time I went out of my house I got a panic attack and felt extremely tired. Even simple shopping in the nearby grocery store was a few hours struggle with my own psychics. I was terrified especially by claustrophobic places full of people. Such as public transport or shops. Doctor diagnosed a strong anxiety and panic attacks and prescribed me an SSRI pills for help. Couple months had passed and now I feel bit better. I can function normally to some extend. However I still fell trapted under my mental conditions and don't know what to do. 

I am extremely procrastinating and have terrible sleeping pattern. I wake up with head full of things to do. But suddenly I feel very stressed and to avoid those thoughts I'm browsing internet, watching movies or playing video games. Just for a little release. Then it becomes very late and I feel depresed that I did nothing whole day. I usually go sleep at 3 or 4am and wake up around 2 pm. Just to repeat the same patterns again and again. Very ofther I put off time even simple things like bank transfer or call someone  due to hight stress level.  After few days thoughts of neglection about those things became a very heavy burden.

My head is full of thought, mostly negative ones. I am IT programmer however I cannot find a job, even attempt to find one. Since I cannot focus on anything more then for a few minutes. So I'm slowly running out of money.  I've always been an ambitious person with strong 'go big' attitude and recent chain of enormous failures makes me even harder to push anything forward. Now I am afraid of any failure so each effort to improve is very difficult.

I used to be a very happy and helpful person with tons of friends but recently I've cut off almost all my social relations except my family and girlfriend. She's extremely patience and trying to help me but I feel that one day dealing with me will be too difficult for her. Which scares me even more. Some members of my family know about my problems. They are very sensitive about my current state and I don't want to depressed them more. So I lie that everything is going much better with me. 

Yesterday I have failed my university exam. I was learning whole night (procrastination)  and woke up at midday with my head bumping. I couldn't leave my house since I was too tired and afraid about another panic atack (they're much stronger if I I don't sleep at least 7-8 hours). I was too stressed to get back to sleep even for a moment either. 

I think that was a final call. At this moment I don't have a suicidal thoughts but I feel if I won't fix it the rest of my life will be an endless suffer and misery. I believe that extremely self discipline and more positive attitude would help me a lot. Yet, I cannot do any of that. Slowly dying inside.  
I'm desperate to seek any help or advices. Maybe someone had been through something similar and won. I would be more then happy for any responses. Thanks.",08Feb2020,1
2,"I have a friend that's depressed and suffers from anxiety. She's failed I college and decided to drop out... she's been heart broken multiple times, feels like she is a disappointment to her mother (her father is dead). She literally has no will to live because she's constantly in physical and emotional pain and I've been trying to help her for more than a year now and at this point I literally don't know what else i can do. Her mother refuses to get therapy because she doesn't believe and that makes it worse for her. I know this might not be the right community but i really need some advice.",08Feb2020,1
3,"I've come here because I don't really know where else to go. Long story short, I lack the motivation to follow a dream. That dream being the completion of a novel. 

The inability to find any sort of motivation to finish things is something I've struggled with for a long time. I remember as far back as elementary school my father noticed in regards to me playing hockey, ""Unless you have someone riding your ass, you won't do it yourself."" 

When someone is expecting something of me and I have something to lose, I can push through and succeed at whatever I put my mind to. I graduated at the top of my class with a 4.29 GPA for this reason. My teachers and my parents knew what I was capable of academically and I understood that they expected me to rise to the occasion, so I did. I became a perfectionist with my academics because of it. Going back to hockey, when I had coaches that were ""hard asses"" and let me know I needed to pick it up and be better, that's exactly what I did. If I had coaches that weren't constantly riding me, I struggled to be as good as I could be. After I graduated and college came knocking, I went for a year and have now taken the last two off. I couldn't stick to a plan. I aced my freshman year but I was indecisive with which major to choose. I plan on returning this Fall but am still unsure of what to do once there.

Even with relationships, I struggle with passion. I dated one girl my senior year for a month, and she noticed it too. For the first few weeks she was my world. And almost as quickly as it started, I lost interest. Without even realizing it I was backing away, not caring as much as I had at the beginning. She confronted me on it and I managed to turn it around a bit. But, we ended up breaking up soon after. Granted, there were several other issues with the relationship emanating from both parties, but that was a big one on my end. 

Now, at 20 years old, soon to be 21, with no one behind me telling me to pedal faster, I can't find the right gear. I have stories I want to tell. Stories that I have envisioned with characters that I love and worlds beyond my wildest dreams. But, when I want to try and put it all together and actually form what I've seen into a coherent story, I struggle. I started working on the first book and got about four chapters in. I haven't touched it since Octoberish. When I start to think about all of the time I've wasted it frustrates the hell out of me. I get angry with myself and convince myself I'm worthless for not having the drive to do it. Then, I tell myself to just give up completely or wait for someone to come do it for me. 

I want to break free of this destructive pattern. And I know a common answer might be something like, ""You're the only one who can fix it. You just have to try."" The issue is I don't even know where to begin to try. I know life is difficult and if you want something you'll go after it until you see it done. I've done it before with school. After I completed my freshman year with straight A's I set a goal that I would finish high school with nothing but A's, and I did. I then wanted to continue the streak into college, and I did. But I had something to lose. Parental respect, wasted monetary investment, etc. 

I now have a new something, but  me failing at this goal doesn't have any repercussions. If I fail, I only have myself to let down and for some reason that's not enough to get me to the right state of mind.

TLDR; I'm wishy washy, and lack passion and motivation to accomplish goals without someone pushing me. And I don't want to waste the time I'm given now and regret it in the future.",08Feb2020,1
4,"Howdy, I'll try to make this short. 

Basically, I don't want to do anything,ever. I have periods where I'm motivated and feel like a powerful, bad ass lady. I'll clean the whole house, make something cool, cook dinner, kick ass at work, etc. However, lately I'm really bad about getting out of bed on time. I eventually do get up because I HAVE to, I can't not work. I work part time (30 hours) until something with more hours comes around, and I'm in school part time because I have to work. So, it isn't like my life is filled up with responsibilities. I'm normally a hobby-hopper, normally love reading, love walking (especially in the winter), and used to eat relatively healthy. If I didn't have to work, I would probably never leave my apartment, let alone my bed. My body feels so heavy, and I'm not sure why this is happening. I can't convince myself to do anything. I tried to make lists, I tried to make like Nike and JUST DO IT, tried to have my husband keep my accountable, nothing. I kind of feel nothing, not any particular sadness, however I have always felt insecure and like my life doesn't matter a pea. It's like my body and brain gave up without my permission. Is this just normal laziness? If anyone else has had this experience, what the hell is going on and how did you manage?",08Feb2020,1
5,"I have severe ocd and depression. I go to therapy and my therapist gives me all these cognitive skills to beat back the intrusive depressing thoughts but it's like I see through it every time. She tells me to deep breath and as I start there's a voice in the back of my mind saying ""Why you useless shit you know I will be here, you know I will be back."" I lost my grandma this past week and she meant the world to me, the only woman to show me love other than my SO. We buried her yesterday and since I have had terrifying thoughts and no this has not been the only time I've been suicidal. Its been seven years of this, the maddening cycle of intrusive depressing thoughts.

What's worse is my SO blames herself even though she goes through hell trying to make me feel better, which makes me feel even more guilty cuz I know I'm holding her back and it makes her feel useless even when I tell her she means everything to me. She's pushed me to go to therapy, practices coping skills with me, puts on meditation videos everything she can all the while I feel like I'm possessed by something telling me that I would just be better off dead. I try to think of my SO, my family, my newborn nephew and I know it would devastate them if I did anything to my self but I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel and I'm so tired of fighting.",08Feb2020,1
6,"My daughter is 17, she recently got diagnosed with psychosis. She’s been on risperidone 2mg for four weeks now and there has been minimal improvements. She hears voices, gets vibrational messages though car engines and the tv. It’s scary for her. Her doctor wants her on the med for six weeks before he calls it a failure. My question is how many meds did you try before finding one that works, also did your psychosis become permanent? Do you have to stay on meds for long term? She was lucky to see a youth psychiatrist for the diagnosis and will see him again March 10th. Also she sees her GP every two weeks",08Feb2020,1

9,"I haven't had a psychotic episode in a couple months and I'm on anti psychotics but my parents recently made me cut the pill in half because they think that it is contributing to my terrible mood swings and impulsiveness. I just chewed two nicotine gum pieces and got buzzed, and then started to feel really weird and now I'm getting weird small visuals like I did before an episode would become full blown. I looked at a picture of me from when I was little and the smile looked really really weird and then went back to normal. I'm really freaked out and don't know if im going to have an episode. Can nicotine cause this or is it probably another factor? I have been drinking excessively every day and today I only took one sip because im trying to quit, I know withdrawals can cause hallucinations but its only been about 4 hours since I drank a tiny bit.

He also told me that my grandparents were devastated because I haven’t called them lately. I felt extremely bad and got really stressed out and called them. It was fine, they weren’t devastated at all. 


He exaggerated he whole situation and it made me feel like shit. He pressured me to call them instantly just to make himself feel better. 

He knows how how bad my mental state is, but still call me constantly to vent about his problems. 

It’s not the first time he’s done this, my whole family is like this. I don’t like them.

18," I find that I am largely motivated by anxiety about doing worse than my peers, rather than through internal motivation. Growing up, I was constantly told things like ""person x went to Harvard/got this grade/got this scholarship, why aren't you doing the same?"" I realize that this is a stereotype of Asian parents but I've realized that this way of thinking has been very ingrained in me.

I'm a second year uni student and I was a med school hopeful, I was doing everything right; volunteering, research, high GPA, etc. In retrospect I feel like I was motivated more by competing with my peers than anything else. I decided this year that I want to pursue computer science instead, and I'm starting from ground 0. I feel crushing anxiety about my career because I feel that I'm years behind of everyone else.

On one hand, the motivation is good because it makes me get stuff done; I have a research internship in computer science lined up for the summer and I'm working on catching up to everyone else. On the other, I feel like my way of thinking is extremely toxic. I applied to a leadership program for computer science students at my school with a friend of mine. I know that this is horrible, but my instinct was to want him not to get in, so that I could feel that I am ahead of him.

Does anyone else feel that they are doing poorly if they are not doing significantly better than their peers? I feel like the way I was brought up contributed to a lot of this, although I'm trying to overcome it now.",08Feb2020,1

And I’m afraid I might kill someone one day, and not even remember killing them. Hell, I’ve slapped my younger brother before and don’t even remember doing it.

She went in this morning with a small list of things that have been bugging her, because she has problems with talking sometimes. Her therapist basically told her all session that all her issues are trauma based and that she's fine. Repeating how she doesnt like it when my partner talks out how she is feeling with me, and how my partner is coping fine. At the end of the session her therapist told her that she basically doesnt need therapy anymore and when my partner asked why, she said it was because she was fine and everything is PTSD and she can deal with it. She was very upset when she came home and feels like she did something wrong. Is this how therapy sessions are supposed to go? Do you get kicked out if they deem you okay after diagnosing you?? I just feel like she was threated wrongly and ignored when she came in with issues and concerns today. And as someone who is always with my partner, I see her breakdowns often. She has a hard time getting herself to do things, has been distant, more irritable, and incredibly anxious. I know she isnt okay and it hurts to know she doesn't have a professional to turn to anymore.",08Feb2020,1
21," I’ve always struggled with \**diet\** antisocial tendencies. I’ve never had a problem staying within the law, but I’ve always been disruptive and provocative among my peers. I like seeing a good fight and can’t seem to help myself when given an opportunity to instigate drama. I never do any of this to harm any specific person but causing general anarchy gives me weird satisfaction. I’m a psychology student in university and I feel the ease in which people become distraught is like constant bobbing bait. I wouldn’t have any friends if it weren’t for my charisma; I know exactly how to behave to get people to like me, but I always feel the need to introduce chaos.  

I’ve noticed I become very agitated and suspicious when things go well. If I get others on the same page to the point we achieve absolute consensus, I feel as if something is wrong. Perhaps I have natural paranoid tendencies that cause me to provoke others because I know their rage is genuine regardless of how they try to present themselves in public.    


It’s very hard for me to feel guilty about my actions when those effected aren’t people I care about. I only seem to respect people who are genuine with me. If someone behaves in a reserved manner, (watching what they say, having general courtesy, etc) I feel I am unable to trust them. I’m very socially outgoing and very good at breaking the ice but I treat interactions more like a game than something thoughtless and natural.   

I've recently upset some of my friends by instigating some online drama in our community. I was able to rationalize my actions clearly to them but they still remain sensitive. I felt if I was able to logically deconstruct my behavior to them they would feel less effected. I've apologized to them and even though I know I should feel guilty I do not.

I realize this makes me sound like a huge asshole, and maybe I am, but these aspects of my own behavior and cognition puzzle me to a great degree. I haven't studied psychopathy in depth but it seems to be checking a lot of boxes.",08Feb2020,1

I was surprised to get an appointment that fast and wasn't prepared so I didn't know what to say. Nonetheless I got a new appointment and am like confused. I really think, that this talking helped me, but I never had a therapy or something like that and don't know what or how to say something. Also, it was exhausting and I feel really down today.

2 days later, I woke to her asking me if we could have an open relationship. I reacted poorly, I got mad and just started ranting and raving. I was insulted by the thought. I said some really mean things, including doubting her faithfulness because of the timing of the message. We've been fighting about this for close to a week now and she admitted she doubts whether she wants to continue a relationship after this. This was after I finally mustered the courage to contact the national crisis line for some advice, and using it.

I've had suicidal thoughts before, but never like this. I've always hoped somebody would do the work for me, until today I've never seen that someone as me. I'm afraid to come forward and get help at the moment because I have work in the morning and want to keep up my professional image. I also don't know if someone would be able to find this on a background check. On top of that, I wanted to marry this girl, have kids and settle down. She doesn't know that I wanted to marry her because I came to that conclusion days before the fighting started. We don't live together, I live with my parents while trying to get my life together enough to move forward.

My fear here is that I'll wake up in the middle of the night and terminate all of the indiscretions going on in my brain. I feel like a coward, I feel helpless. I have guns but I've disassembled the firing mechanisms and attempted to hide them from myself.

Recently I’ve been doing a lot of self therapy and trying to learn more about what kind of person I am, as well as being more self aware with my feelings and environment around me. After months of religiously practicing self bettering skills and self care, I started to notice that I am not as crazy or mentally ill as I grew up to believe. Instead, I learned I am actually a smart, funny, like able person. I just lacked confidence, and had a lot of toxic beliefs that I thought were normal. My mom always told me I was mentally ill, but she has never once offered me a therapist. She’d say I needed one, but she wouldn’t ever go farther than that.

I’ll try not to make this post long, and there’s a lot of abusive patterns that I picked up on, but I won’t cover them all unless you guys want me to. 

1.)  Gaslighting to the point where I questioned if anything was real.
My mother groomed me to believe that she was always right, and if she knew she wasn’t right, I was wrong for confronting her. 

2,) Shed make me feel guilty for being excited about something I liked.
Honestly even now, I get a bad feeling in my gut when I think about my new car, or moving out on my own very soon. If I expressed these things to her she’d give me a disapproving look, or tell me all the things that could go wrong if I followed my dreams. 

3.) She doesn’t credit me for my accomplishments-Instead she goes completely silent and I get angry/jealousy vibes.

4.) She would complain about me not opening up to her, but whenever I open up and become vulnerable to her, she brings it up in my face when she’s angry.  

5.) She has narcissistic parental habits (Id search YouTube for more information on that)

However with all these things, I always thought they were normal, or that I was just the one who was screwing up all the time. I even suffer from depression and feeling like I’ll never be good enough for anyone or anything. My mom always held that over my head but would never offer any help for it. Instead she’d bring it up whenever I was feeling bad or did something wrong, which would make it worse. 

Now that I’m aware of my situation I have no idea what to do. I’ve pushed all my friends away, and I don’t know who to turn to. If anyone is willing to talk please don’t hesitate to pm me :)",08Feb2020,1
33,How do I get rid of it. Because of it I can’t study anymore. Everytime I want to study that phrase runs in my mind and I feel guilty. Like I did something wrong. It gives me anxiety and makes me feel guilty for no reason and I can’t concentrate anymore. Please help me.,08Feb2020,1
34,"I’ve been through a lot of shit. Not real shit but shit in my head. Depression, anxiety, ocd, and adhd. I beat depression (for the most part) a few months ago, but I’m still unable to feel pleasure or interest in anything, and my social anxiety is gotten much worse. But thats not bad enough. I can’t get off that easy. So life throws another problem at me. Chronic back pain. Every fucking day. It started around 7 months ago and has gotten worse and worse as time went on. So maybe I can get it diagnosed and fixed right? No. I tried physical therapy, got an X-ray and mri, and saw a  orthopedic surgeon. He said “nothing looks wrong with your back, just take ibuprofen when you need to!” Ibuprofen doesn’t help stupid motherfucker. As some as I finally get away from depression after a year, I get undiagnosed chronic back pain. What the fuck is this about. You can get up and life’s just gonna throw you back down. What the fuck is the point.",08Feb2020,1
35,"So Im pretty sure I have anxiety issues for years, possibly also periods of depression too... I don’t really know. 

Where I am at now is that I am 7 months post graduation from a masters course unemployed. I have been applying for graduate jobs for over a year now without success obviously. Well January And December I submitted like 5 applications. 

I feel like after my masters I would have a job by now. In October I had a part time receptionist job but the boss basically fired me via the recruitment agency after 2 weeks because “I wasn’t the right fit”. I was basically at a halls of residence by my self while she was at the other Halls of residence on the other side of town. I was the only staff at the site... I’m not really a “outgoing person” and not a small talk person which I guess she didn’t seem to like as the other agency hire she seemed to click with. I didn’t really want to be there but knew I had to and it was not difficult. My work was good - but I guess my ‘customer service’ was not was she was expecting. So that was very sudden and I felt even more like a failure after being in a job hunt for about 2 months ish by then. And I could even keep a job which someone with no uni experience would have no issue doing. Which I was doing alright at... 

Then I just shut down I guess after that, saw the agency person an hour or so after she called to hand back keys and just couldn’t stop crying because of shock I guess. 

A few weeks later my parents were over, we had a short trip and I had my graduation ceremony then we flew home for Christmas. I was there for a month - my parents were getting me to do research on this and that emailing this person they know through this person etc. Then comparing my failure and disappointment with oh so and so is doing this. Why can’t you. Oh so and so goes to the gym everyday. So and so is doing a full time masters and a part time job. Do you not want to work. 

Before I even finished my masters dissertation which I handed in late because I was feeling lost and stressed out. The department let me have an extension so that was fine in terms of late penalty etc. BUT nope that’s on my list of failures in my parents world. And in that extra days of my high stress and failure - I would be out in the local high street and my parents would point and make me take a photo of every single job advert we would walk past. The cheese place, cafes, bars, fishmonger etc. like 10 ish. And have been every time I go into town when they are here. 

I did hand in my CV to basically all of them - but didn’t hear back from any of them. 


Now back to January - I’m not home with them. They went on a month long holiday in New Zealand and Australia as they are basically retired now. I have been at home and just don’t have the energy or drive to do anything. Been going to the gym a bit, cooking at home, done some baking and watching a lot. I just feel lost, after all the applications and days that go past I don’t even know what I am doing anymore. Also I basically have no friends, I have friends from school and home. But they are either on the other side of the world, busy or haven’t really reached out but neither have they - kinda just drifted apart I guess. My parents are sending me job adverts, random kind of related articles. Next week one of them is coming to visit for god knows how long and I am just going to be shouted at and going to be seen as even more of a failure and disappointment as I have done nothing. 

Oh I was supposed to have been continuing driving lessons. I was doing some between September and November. But haven’t done any since I go back. I just don’t like driving, I technically have a license from passing abroad 4 years ago in a non useful setting. As it had no normal traffic or road conditions. So I am basically a beginner and terrified and don’t have the need or want to drive. So there is that to add to the list. 

I just don’t know what I am doing and feel lost. And me not having any job part time or full time is just me being a disappointment and failure. I am not a social person in any regards never have been and that is another “issue”. Which also means that these part time jobs I am not suitable for as they are majority customer service client facing positions. Which look for “outgoing” people. 

I guess this all introverted behaviors got worse when I was in my undergrad, first year was rough. I chose to go to a uni across the world, I had been to boarding school so thought I would be fine. It was thousands of miles from home and where school was basically from the friends I had and family. Mostly chose it to be away from family and thought the prestige status would make me not be a disappointment. I had alright grades but of course they were not enough, because hating chemistry and not getting a high grades is a failure. Visited the city before making the final decision on uni and liked it from the week visit. It was going alright, spoke to people had a roommate we kinda spoke. Spent most of my time on my own but I was fine with that. Went to events which the RA held. The October my roommate said she was going to swap rooms with someone and I was getting a new roommate with someone I didn’t know. From there I guess it got worse. I don’t really speak to this new roommate all year. Then winter arrived and the city is in snow and ice for about 5 months in the year, and goes down to -20 degrees c - a new level of cold for me. Oh and this is very much a party city/ school which is not me at all. I don’t drink it just doesn’t agree with me and don’t like it. So there was that. The halls was the biggest in the uni like 700 people and 50 on the floor. So not really tight knit community which meant me being alone was inevitable... 

The remaining 3 years I lived on my own in private student halls. Never had friends who I had weekend plans with. Joined band for 3.5 years as something I do. I guess I just learnt and existed on my own for so long that I got used to it. My masters I came back to where I did boarding school / well near ish. Got on with people on my course and it was the same people all year not like with my undergrad where every course was a different combo of people. Saw some of my school friends again. 

But now I have no classes to go to, those friends from The course are in different cities and wasn’t really close friends with. My friends from school are in proper jobs and busy and some not here at all. My family isn’t here all the time... and are now traveling the world. While I feel like I have no purpose except getting a job . 

I know my parents just want the best for me and not to waste away my life and not be financially dependent on them. But they show the support in an increasingly angry and not understanding way. I am just the lazy one, who doesn’t want to do anything one. 

I guess I’ve just been so self isolated to different degrees over the years resulting to the state which I am in now. Which I think is anxiety and maybe depression? I do think when I think back to first year of uni - I could have been depressed then. I felt so alone then and just way to overwhelmed and there was so many people that I just got by on my own for so long. And I didn’t speak with my roommate at all and the second half of the year my RA was going through his own was worse issues... I did want to transfer but my grades weren’t the top, i didn’t fail they were just average. So me wanting to transfer was another point of anger and going back for second year that was hard but i had my own space, my own room so that got my through. 

Thanks if you got through all of this - I’ve been feeling scared and stressed about when my parents visit next week. And the fact that I have basically done nothing. And they don’t get it, I’m just a lazy person to them who when told that I am and questioned what is wrong with me and that I need to do this and that and if any tears come out - I get shouted at basically. And tears are not allowed and my attitude needs to change, I need to get a barista job or a retail job something. 

But also I think I will be dragged to therapy next week too.. but that terrifies me. As you could probably tell I’m not good with strangers at all. Which is why I basically have no friends. I guess part of it is that I have been forced to do so many things and have not like them that I just never found what I like. I was forced as a kid to do piano, ballet, extra tutor class in most things, swimming. Which is why I kind of wanted to go to boarding school at age 12. Then I was forced to do things but it was different. But then my holidays were basically then tutoring lessons. Oh and my mum hates my school because I am still a failure as I didn’t get top grades and she feels the school didn’t push me to get the top grades. So there’s that, the place which I felt at home... when home was feeling less like home as my granddad moved home the year after I started boarding school then a few years later moved in with us. I didn’t really speak with him, language barriers I had limited conversation abilities in his language and he didn’t speak English... I guess me going to boarding school might me the root of being a failure to my mum at least.",08Feb2020,1
36,"I feel like I'm spiraling lately and I don't know what to do about it. I used to care about so much; grades, video games, friends. Now it seems like I'm not caring or gaining any joy out of the things I used to love. My grades are slipping this semester, but I find myself not having the energy to care whenever I get another bad grade. I still play video games for hours a day because it's what my friends are doing, but I don't even like it that much. I feel like I'm just passing the time until the next day when the cycle repeats. I have so few friends right now and I'm starting to get the feeling that most of them don't actually care about me. This has resulted in me spending more and more time alone because I'm so bad at meeting and connecting with people and it sucks. I've always envisioned my future being happy with me having a wife and kids someday, but the thought of that just seems so unrealistic to me.

I really just dont understand why im scared its like ive just watched a documentary about a murderer and im scared too look round the corner, I live away from family and dont feel close enough to talk to my housemates about this issue which is usually what I'd do but its just sticking to me and I know its not my usual depression or anxiety, for example when my depression gets bad it feels painful and makes me want to hurt myself but im just scared now and I cant sleep because of it. anyway idk whats happening and I would just like to pin point what it may be and get rid of it, any advice may help, thanks.

I was born on Thursday July 27th 1995. 

I have two crushes since January of 2017 that will not go away and I can't do anything about. 

My one crush who we'll call Jeneva, was born on Wednesday January 11th 1995. she is 197 days older than me.

My other Crush, who we'll call Jasmine was born on Wednesday April 26th 1995. she is 92 days older than me.

197 + 92 = 289 

if you flop Geneva in Jasmine's birthday is on the other side of me you would have Friday October 27th 1995 (I was 197do) and Friday February 9th 1996 (I was 92days old).  

halfway between those two dates is Monday December 18th and Tuesday 19th nearing the end of 1995.

When I was 144 days old.
It was Monday December 18th 1995. 
144 is less than half of 289. 

When I was 145 days old. 
It was Tuesday December 19th 1995. 
145 exceeds half of 289. 

The Blue Ghost Tunnel under the Third Welland Canal in between Locks 18 and 19 located near Niagara Falls, Ontario 🇨🇦. 

The Blue Ghost tunnel is infamous and also known for being one of Canada's most haunted locations. 

on Friday June 14th 2019 I was trying to avoid posts about the recent NBA championship because I wanted to see more regarding the st. Louis Blues very first Stanley Cup championship for the u.s. state of Missouri. 

at that time, I was at I was at the Blue Ghost Tunnel. 

A girl who we'll call Jazmine G (she happens to have the same name as the other Jazmin (Jazmin F/1995-04-26) in real life. 

Jazmine G was born on none other, then Monday December 18th 1995. I was 144 days old. 

I noticed a disturbing coincidence when she posted about the NBA championship. 

this was the first championship in Canada since I was either of us were born. (1995)

the last Canada championship for professional sports was by the Montreal Canadiens in 1993 when they defeated the Los Angeles Kings. 

Jazmine G and I and I were both born in 1995, 144 days apart.

the Toronto Raptors were actually funded and none other then 1995. 

when the Montreal Canadiens won the Stanley Cup in 1993 I wasn't even born yet and neither was she. 

I thought this was super interesting. 

remember how I said the blue Ghost tunnel runs in between locs 18 and 19 under the old former third Welland Canal? 

she use the hashtag #wethenorth. 

lock 18, is immediately north of the Blue Ghost tunnel. 

lock 19, is immediately south of the blue Ghost tunnel. 

amazingly, The Blue Ghost tunnel was constructed in 1875 which was 145 years ago but the tunnel was completed and opened early on in 1876 which was 144 years ago this was super interesting to me but it is a little bit complicated/hard to comprehend for some. 

I know it's really complicated and confusing and not everyone can comprehend the information and thank the same way that I do. 

that's not exactly a good thing. 

it is easier for me to remember people's date of births than it is their full names as crazy as that sounds that's how it is for me with my obsession with certain numbers and certain dates and that is actually quite common with people with mild forms of autism. 

when I'm alone at night I pretend I'm always hanging out with Jeneva and both Jazmin's. 

I don't want anything sexual with them, I want them to love me the same way that I love my dog. 

I love him dearly and affectionate and sweet way. 

I love pretending that they'll often like to hug/hold me to show love and affection and roleplay that of close and sweet affection and Friends. 

I understand it's unrealistic but it helps me sleep at night. 

the four of us are really good friends.

44,"I have a hard time dealing with the fact that my breasts are so sensitive. I hate it so much. I would say it’s a strong erogenous zone, so much that even I cant touch them without getting a feeling “down there”. 
Im worried about this for several reasons. 
Because they are so sensitive that even if I get a feeling from them getting touched I feel gross afterwards. I really wish there was something I could do to fix this. Because people pressure mothers to nurse their kids but if I ever have a child I just don’t think I can do that. Which is quite sad.  
And during sex, even though Im a virgin I think sex should be an act of bonding. But if I have to have my breasts exposed I think it would take away from the romance since it’s such an erogenous zone I couldn’t focus on the feeling behind it which isn’t what I want. I rather focus on emotions and romance, when I do that it doesn’t feel yucky but imagining it only for sexual arousal is just.. yucky to me. 
But if I wear a bra during sex would that be weird? And take away from the intimacy? I feel pressured to have to be okay with it even though I don’t want to. Im scared that if I ever get into a relationship and it comes time to making love that the guy Im with will not like me wearing a bra. 
I feel weird being this way but I really hate that it’s such an erogenous zone for me. Is there a way I can do something to make them not such a “sexy zone” for me. It ruins the whole idea of love making for me. There are other problems I have with this that I’d rather not speak on right now. But I just wish I can desensitize them or something.

I just want some help from her or others because I've been dealing with all this stress and panic for my whole life and I've always been alone, and now that I found someone I just want them to help me. but maybe im just crazy and im over thinking everything like I always do.

I had to go through thyroid cancer being young, so I think part of it occurs because of this and hormonal issues that come with it. It's difficult to manage my emotions sometimes. I also lack a lot of self confidence. I think of myself really low academically, mentally and the way I look. I also feel like I have no one to talk to and no genuine friends. Usually, I get upset about my grades even though I work really hard. so when I come home with a bad grade and after letting out my emotions, I feel guilty for trying to distract myself from my emotions.

53,"Recently I’ve been going insane. I’m hearing voices, hallucinating, dissociating, and multiple breakdowns everyday. I decided to finally reach out to my therapist and tell her what’s been going and now everything is just going downhill. I’m being sleep tested and Im also going to get psychologically tested. My therapist believes I have DID and both of my parents are taking it differently.

My mom is blaming everything on the fact that she believes I have a gluten and dairy sensitivity and if I just cut out those foods everything would be fixed. My dad wants to be live nothing is wrong with me and instead of helping me through this he’s taking it as an opportunity to point fingers at other people.

I just blocked all my friends so that way they don’t have to deal with me anymore. I feel so bad for them for having to put up with all of bullshit all the time. I’m so needy and I constantly need to talk to somebody, but they shouldn’t have to waste their time on me, especially when they’re dealing with their own issues.

I’m contemplating if suicide would be the best option. Nobody would care if I died and it would probably make everybody’s life better. I just feel like living isn’t worth it if this is the life I’m stuck with.",08Feb2020,1
54,"I'll try not to make this too long, b/c if I went into everything, this would be a whole novel. And by help, I'm asking those of you out there who have severe anxiety, what has helped you better manage your symptoms? I know there's no way to completely alleviate it, as great as that would be. But me, my boyfriend, his family and his counselors are at a real loss here of how to help him.

It started about a year ago towards the beginning of our relationship, about a year and a half ago. But he has had problems with anxiety/depression all his life. So it started out as him getting dizzy spells, not related to his health or anything. Sometimes random, sometimes caused by things like driving or going out in public. Then his panic attacks started getting more severe as time went on, and more frequent. Sometimes they'd come out of nowhere, but usually were caused by something that was anxiety-inducing. His emotions in general too have become more pronounced, like anger and happiness, and sometimes will get panicked because of it. 

He's okay with leaving the house, but needs me or someone in his family to go with him. He's hesitant of trying new things, including therapies. And there are times where his symptoms will improve for a week or two, but he always goes crashing back down. 

He's tried different anxiety medications at varying doses, they'll help for a little while but he'll go right back to where he was in the first place. And his anxiety has gotten worse over time. It's gotten to the point now where he gets a couple panic attacks a day, the littlest things will set off his anxiety. Nothing really seems to calm him down, either. He doesn't even seem to get very happy anymore, his depression is getting worse as well. He does still leave the house, but will get dizzy/panicy much more and needs to leave.

So like I said, I just need some advice on things we can try to help him. He's miserable and wants to go back to his normal self. What are some types of therapy that have helped you? What coping strategies help in every day life? And what routines have you incorporated in your day-to-day life that help? Thank you to those who respond and hope you're all doing well",08Feb2020,1

61,"AVPD or Avoidant Personality disorder is something that stops me from living a life.  
Mental health in my country is not taken seriously(Russia), so I cannot officially confirm it, but through years of research and fact checking - it fits.   
In Google short tearms:

 ***Avoidant personality disorder*** *is one of a group of conditions called anxious* ***personality disorders****, which are marked by feelings of nervousness and fear. People with* ***avoidant personality disorder*** *have poor self-esteem. They also have an intense fear of rejection and being negatively judged by others.*

62,"When I fail at anything, my emotional state slowly declines and repeated failures may turn to full blown sadness or even outbursts, however the outbursts have mostly morphed into sadness over the years. However, sometimes my state drops so quickly that just one failure will set me off. These usually happen when something I do is spoken or evident to an entire audience. This state comes with feeling like a complete failure and idiot and losing my self esteem. 

This applies to homework problems, tests, or anything in school. This also applies to video games and pretty much anything I do. I don’t like shooter games because I am really bad at them and playing them makes my triggers set off quickly. 

This has been a problem with me for many years. I have aspergers and ADHD. I remember these behaviors starting around the time I was on all these supplements and hyperbaric chamber therapy nonsense along with my mom trying to stop my stimming. I’m not sure if that could’ve traumatized me somehow and started these behaviors, or if some weird development triggered in me out of nowhere. Over all these years though, it has tanked my self esteem in general to nothing. I have very little self esteem and I feel like I will fail everything.

She went to the ER a few weeks ago and texted me (she was still allowed to have her phone and clothes by that ER's rules) and said that she might be going to residential. We talked it out for more than an hour and decided that we need to step back from our relationship and focus on our own health first. We tried so hard to make it work, we took it slow and checked in with each other often; we went into with such maturity and attraction, but not enough love for ourselves. She didn't want me to just be waiting for months for her to come back, she wants me to be satisfied. I want the same for her, but she just can't have that right now and it hurts me to see. But I've been through it all too, and look at me now: I'm better, I heal everyday, I stop and smell the flowers, I cope, I take my meds, and I'm not self-harming. She will get better and I need to let her do that on her own.
I haven't been able to turn the hurt into motivation yet; it still really, really hurts not to have someone to hold and someone to hold me. But I know I will be able to someday. I'll be ok and so will she. And I know that we will come back to each other, we agree that we just click.",08Feb2020,1

66,"Hi! Over the past few months I've had a lot of problems with sleep. Once I'm asleep I have no problem staying asleep (which actually often causes me to miss classes, etc), but when I'm trying to *get to sleep* I find I often can't because:

1. I feel anxious about today and whether I've been working hard enough.

2. I feel anxious about the coming day.

3. My sleep schedule is already so off-kilter that the seldom times I'm not anxious, my brain doesn't feel like it's actually time for bed.

I've tried melatonin (doesn't seem to do anything for me), limiting screen time, reading, and a whole bunch of other stuff, but it never seems to help. The one reprieve I've had recently is by smoking weed right before bed, but that doesn't seem like a good long term solution (even though it has honestly been a godsend over the past couple of weeks).

Two questions:

1. Has anybody had success with therapy for insomnia? Was it succesful?

2. Alternatively, is there anything else that I could be overlooking?

67,"The only psychiatric condition I've *officially* been diagnosed with is bipolar 2. I believe it's progressed to bipolar 1 (if that's possible) as the episodes of mania are getting increasingly worse. When the disorder first developed my episodes were productive, I was filled with an energy that made me feel as if the world were mine. 

Now, they're different. I am in a state of near constant panic during an episode. I hear things that aren't there, or see shadows of people that don't exist. Sometimes I get delusional and think the whispers I hear are conspiring to kill me. In these episodes I'm not even here, I rarely have a recollection of what specifically happens. Usually I'll have an hour or two each day where I'm lucid, where I realize how fucking insane I am, only to return into that insanity far too soon.

To make matters worse, the hallucinations are spilling into my normal life. When I'm not having an episode I realize they aren't real, but I will still hear the voices or see the faces in the corner of my eye. It's been worst these past few days, and I've been in a state of panic the whole time. I can't seem to stay grounded in reality lately. My world is losing color and I can feel nothing. I've started believing this is all a dream of mine, that none of this exists. It certainly doesn't feel real. 

I should mention I'm not medicated. I do not take mood stabilizers and was never prescribed antipsychotics as I didn't receive a diagnosis that needed them. For a time I took antidepressants but they made the episodes CONSTANT and I almost died (my fault lol) so needless to say I don't take them now.

When I was 16, I had this older guy take advantage of me at a party with his friends. They were both 18. Afterward, they ignored me and bragged to their friends, calling me gross. His younger brother was in my grade, and his friends bullied me too before that happened. I had no social media, and they would make posts about how I looked old and that I'm a fat slut.




They would pick apart my features every day. My lips are too thin, eyes too close together, man jaw, prominent chin, and that I was the ugliest girl in school. I moved away at 18 to a new state; it's been four years since all this happened. The guys in my grade would ask me for sex but tell me not to tell anyone because I was so ugly. They would say no man will ever want me. They said I'm attractive enough to sleep with but not to be seen with me.



I’m just saying why else would people treat me so horribly? Like a random girl from a different school at a party when I was 16 took a photo of me scrunching my face. She egged me on like “your so cute” then posted it online making fun of me calling me ratchet and her guy friends saying I look like a 40-year-old b*tch. Why would people do this unless ugly? They were all graduated and 18/19




They would say I'm the grossest girl in school, and any guy who sleeps with me is desperate. They would greet me by telling me I have wrinkles all over my face that I had peeling skin. I was so disgusting I burned and deleted all the photos from school. Is it true when people bully you it shows their shitty character, not yours?

I am currently taking Zoloft (which works moderately well for me) and Abilify to treat depression, anxiety and PTSD. I don’t plan on going off of these medications for a natural remedy but I wonder if adding magnesium supplements to my daily routine would show improvements. 

The paper reads, “Between June 2015 and May 2016, 112 participants provided analyzable data. Consumption of magnesium chloride for 6 weeks resulted in a clinically significant net improvement in PHQ-9 scores of -6.0 points (CI -7.9, -4.2; P&lt;0.001) and net improvement in Generalized Anxiety Disorders-7 scores of -4.5 points (CI -6.6, -2.4; P&lt;0.001). Average adherence was 83% by pill count. The supplements were well tolerated and 61% of participants reported they would use magnesium in the future. Similar effects were observed regardless of age, gender, baseline severity of depression, baseline magnesium level, or use of antidepressant treatments. Effects were observed within two weeks. Magnesium is effective for mild-to-moderate depression in adults. It works quickly and is well tolerated without the need for close monitoring for toxicity.” 

Here is a link to the article published in the Public Library of Science: [Role of magnesium supplementation in the treatment of depression: A randomized clinical trial](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180067)",08Feb2020,1

I recently took a personality test at my school, where they organized a program for helping us getting to know ourselves or what. I think and though that I know everything, but I still completed the 2-hour long test. So when the results came, the psychologist said that my charts are really scary, she has never seen someone with so little empathy and so much anxiety at the same time.

The reality is, that towards humans I feel 0 empathy. I don't care for others, because I feel like us being happy makes everything else unhappy. But we can't do anything about it or not as much as we should, and that's the source of the anxiety I have.

Animals suffer daily, in every single minute so we get food, entertainment, medicine, clothes, makeup and basically everything is from their suffering.
I try to eat food and buy products that are from sustainable sources so I don't see dying orangutans while I eat my sandwich or wash my hair, I don't go to circus and I just really try to do my best but I'm not enough. And neither the few other people who try to lead a similar life, because there's still mass production and a few people minus everyone else doesn't effect anything. 

 I cry daily, I really just wish something came and destroyed us all. The amount of hate and anxiety I have inside myself is something I could not even describe, if I had the chance I'd tell every single person how much I hate them, show them what it's like to be beaten so them and their dumb children can laugh at the dancing tiger at the circus, dump them on fire like they do it with orangutans so they can have some more Nutella. 

The only thing that stops me from committing suicide is that I know that if I don't stand by this and try to do my best with things I can manage (like I go to a cat shelter daily and help socializing the kitties) then there's one person less who doesn't live in a fricking box and act like everything's fine.

84,"So, \~4 years ago I had my first relationship ever, but unfortunately my unchecked rOCD screwed it up and we left on bad terms - I didn't understand what I was going though, I had a lot of panic attacks (which I only get when rOCD is flaring), and was nasty to her in the sense that I thought my rOCD thoughts were real and took it out on her.

&amp;#x200B;

But even years later I feel like I'm competing with her in a sense; I want to have a better life than her and try to match her level (whatever it is; car, rental, music etc). I feel I even have to out-do them. She were my first love, and at the time I felt that they were the most amazing person ever and so perhaps latched onto their image (alty) a bit too much and I feel that I am basing life choices on their expectations of a good-partner, rather than what I really want and who I am. 

&amp;#x200B;

My feelings were incredibly strong - I thought she was so cool, and wanted to be more like her.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I occasionally see her on Instagram, hear songs we both liked, or even smell the smell of her perfume (god it was strong) I still feel quite depressed and nostalgic, and sometimes I get a lil bit panicy (especially if I see someone who looks like her and I mistake her for her at first glance).

Even years later, and relationships in between them and now, I still feel this and it annoys me beyond belief. I just want to let them go, but I can't seem to.

I’m so scared of studying and working.  But it needs to change. I’ve been out of high school and a recluse for 4 years. So this year I’m planning to start studying and get a job. 

So my question is: is there a real reason to be scared? 

For studying I’m scared of being a part of a class, doing presentations, people judging how I look, needing to prepare placement (talking to the professionals and asking if I can work for them as part of studying!! 😵), trying to look professional enough! trying to speak/know what to say in each situation. Etc.

For work it’s the same but worse! Plus worrying about messing up, worrying if coworkers like me, etc (and again if I look professional enough! Because I’m female and hate wearing makeup and also can’t figure out how to do my hair though I’m trying!)

Oh yeah and the main reason I’m scared is because I’m worried they’ll judge me for being out of school for 4 years (or a little bit over now) without ever having a job or studying! I’m worried they’ll think I’m lazy, or a joke or something, or weird, or stupid, or less than them because I did nothing for those years!

And there are probably more reasons why but I don’t want to freak myself out even more by bringing them back up in my memory. 


But yeah... is there a real reason to be scared? Will it all be okay? For real? (Especially will they even hire me/take me in since I’ve done nothing?)


Edit: also do normal people just not think about it? Like my mind is constantly racing thoughts all day and night! Do normal people not have these thoughts like that and they just do it because they can? How can I get to that point? I would love to just think “I’d like to...” then go and do it because I’m free. And not have negative thoughts about what people think or if I am capable, or if it’s gonna turn out good or bad, etc. I’ve literally stressed so much it’s insane. Now I don’t even know what normal thinking is (never really did lol). Like honestly I don’t think I know how people do anything? 

It feels like thinks are always blocking me and I can’t move in any direction... for normal people is it just they can walk wherever they want freely because there is nothing blocking them? How can I get to that point?",08Feb2020,1

When I arrived I realized I had terrible social anxiety I was afraid to talk to people, because of this i didnt really make a lot of friends. I later on developed some depression and it was really hard to enjoy things I didn't see the point in living. In the end of the year I got this massive headache so I decided to go to sleep. I woke up with the same headache and now with double vision. The school took me to get an MRI and surprise! Brain cancer.But I wasn't diagnosed correctly the first time. In the beginning they diagnosed me with neurosarcoidosis and put me on a high dose of steroids for months during this time i gained 20 kilos and my face wasn't even recognizable anymore. I also got a lot of stretch marks around my body which is for sure permanent. During this time my social anxiety turned into general anxiety it was so bad I was getting panic attacks and was constantly shaking. Then when they saw the steroids weren't working they did another biopsy then I was diagnosed with a germinoma. The tumor fucked up my hormones so now I have hypothyroidism, diabetes insipidus and i cant produce testosterone anymore. I basically have to take meds for the rest of my lives. Now I'm struggling through chemotherapy and i really cant tolerate it. I'm also gonna need radiation which will most likely fuck up my brain and make learning hard.

Well,, our family live in Indonesia and long story short is that ,my family is blessed with a geniuses, I'm not saying this to be narcissistic or something, but when you got a big brother who went to UI (University of Indonesia) and a big sister who graduated S1 in 4 years (the minimum is 3,5 years) and already got invited to work in a law firm, you tend to get compared to them a lot.

My family appears to have everything they wanted, i mean, my family is the literally the picturesque type, my father is a contractor, my mother is a stay at home mom, we made more money than 50% of Indonesian, father and mother is at home most of the time, and i usually get what i wanted under some limitation. But, i guess even a family like ours have some downside.

See, here's the thing. I DON'T know what's wrong with myself at the moment, my life is actually pretty decent when you think about it from outside perspective, I'm at the top 20 in our school, i won pretty much every scrabble and English debate competition in provincial level, I have my Best friend helping me and my teacher to listen to my problem.

Now though...I'm not so sure whats wrong with me but i feel like i'm tired of this life, i don't even know why, sure, I'm used to the anxiety of my impending graduation and my college life keeping me awake all the time, i mean, who's not by this point.

I know that this post seems narcissistic sure, but i just feels like i'm faking my face at this point, even though i was already sure of where i want to be going, Institute of Technology in Bandung. I knew that if i wanted to be equal to my siblings, i need to be atleast at that level, and everybody agree. My teacher supported me, my family will help me.

I don't know why but i feel like it's wrong for me to go there, call it a gut feeling or something i don't know, but i feel like i knew that if i do this, I will regret it, I've been talking to some of my online friends about it but they basically just said that i'm stressed and angry, which, i'm not entirely convinced i am.",08Feb2020,1
95,"Trying to Figure Out Things

Well, I (20M) know a girl for half a year or so. We’re sharing similar interests and started online a conversation through them. We got to know each other over time and shared many personal things with each other. We basically formed a bond of mutual trust and she’s actually the first person, apart from my family, caring about my lonely ass genuinely. Though as I learned today, she’s not trusting me at all. She told me about her miserable living conditions; poor overall physical and mental health; suicide attempts and her twisted, hypocritical and manipulating others personality. She also likes to toy around with people she has a relationship with(e.g. family, friends, etc.)

The thing is, I don’t dislike her for being like this. Nor do I care for all those red flags. I’m also one of the first persons that got to know her on such a deep level. I see more and more of my former self in her and I know this pain she’s feeling. That pain, being able to shred you into pieces. I don’t plan to cut ties with her even though she told me, that she may consciously or unconsciously try to manipulate me.

For those of you thinking that I’m guilt trapped, you’re wrong. I honestly don’t feel emotions like other people’s and I doubt, that I even have them. Which is why I come with this here. I severely lack knowledge and experience about human relationships. I don’t even know how to make real friends nor how to keep them.

we are both girls 20 shes 22


We have known each other since 2014 but only became friends this summer going out almost frequently I was physically sick I opened up to her but she wasnt really of any help like supportive but like only listening shes unhealthy and doest care so...

Everytime we go out she gossips and when I say gossip I mean gossip and gossips to a weird extent 

Yes i have told her off nicely but she just doesnt listen 

as I said I have known her since 2014 but we only last summer started meeting up and that is because she used to be a huge nerd and just talks about school and exams like how boring can one be I used to tell her to stop talking about school but she wouldn't listen and instead of stopping talking to me because we dont match she just  keeps coming back and gets angry every time I dont talk to her and one the problem she has is that she talks so much she calls me on my phone after I specifically told her not to because I dont like talking via phone and every day she was in the same bus for just 15 minutes and all that time she talks I dont even know what about because I got so sick like physically sick i told her that I was feeling dizzy and talking in a moving bus makes me sick but she wouldn't stop as if I didnt say anything she left I went home and fucking fainted with dizziness she did it again and again even if I had earphones in so yes after a while I told her again and this time i raised my voice that the whole bus heard me and I could see everyone else was annoyed at her voice she was offended and left she never talked to me even when I was talking to her friends.....

after a year or two we started chatting again and she did the same thing but this time not so so much more online but again  not as much but she dropped the nerdy personality and started being a gossip.

I have tired to deal with her i told her not to gossip but she just says she doesnt know what else to say and when I start talking she diesnt seem interested at all.
I don't trust her with what I have told her she can say whatever it's not a secret but from respect I pretty sure she would tell everyone about my struggles if she had any friends that is

she the type that looks like a dork the sort that would get bullied  and I'm very fashionable yet got bullied too which means I really don't mind that she diesnt dress up like me but our personalities are completely different from one another I told her that we ain't that much friends just catching up she saying  dont be dumb we are friends and we do have things in common like gender eyes nose mouth yes that what we have in common I told her off but she just ignored it I dealt with it

now it's a party coming up that everyone goes to from kids to oldies I want to go and I know that she went before I asked if so she said yes she'll come now she said she'll think about it to then stalling I told her off and that why doesn't she just say no and she did then after I expressed myself that I want her to be honest the first time she said dont worry I'm coming after I told her to not do that because shes only doing it to not lose me the she said no it will get me out of the house because apparently she needs pushing to get out of the house sort of depressed which I know issnt true because she goes out with other people all the time she only said that because she knows I talk about mental health and would feel sorry for her 

I just told her to meet up she knows I'm going to fight with her so she said that she s comignfor the party again after she said no all to keep me

101,"I'll preface with this - my SO has his issues. He's really a kind soul when you get to the heart of who he is. But he does have severe issues with sex addiction, as well as anger. 

I'm about 8 months pregnant. We got together about 4-5 months after his ex wife left. They were together for quite some time, and one of the things we initially bonded over is we were both going through divorces with long term partners (his relationship was 8 years, mine was 5). 

To be truthful, I never liked his ex wife. For his sake, I tried to entertain the idea of them being friends. But, she was physically abusive. She would lie about being raped to cover her infidelity. She would, and still does, constantly mind-game him. 

Recently my trust was kind of broken. He and I have been having our issues. I have abandonment issues, I'm terrified of being cheated on, and I have depression and anxiety, on top of being pregnant. And I saw one of their exchanges recently. She was trying to incite him by sending gifs of porn clips, and the nature of their discussion was how she could tell he was still in love with her. 

Awhile after, for guilt I assume, he came clean about me being pregnant. And I started to have these feelings where I felt guilt towards her for the first time ever. I don't ever want to justify her actions, but I will say he wasn't perfect in their relationship either (sex addiction leads to things like infidelity). 

I'm not sure how to arrange my feelings. Or how to cope with the nature of their relationship. Coming from a background of sexual abuse and rape, her lies alone are completely unforgivable in my eyes. But, he thinks he turned her into what she is. And I can't make him see it another way. 

I'm sure this is a situation that requires therapy. And for the record, I'm trying my best to make sure we stay together. I love him and I don't want to split, especially for my daughter's sake.

105," I am solidly diagnosed with Moderate Severity OCD, Major Depression, Panic Disorder, and Agoraphobia. And therapists suspected PTSD and Bipolar. I’m curious about these things i have that were overlooked. 

This is my first time posting, so go easy on me if i don’t understand how everything works on reddit. I am a late teen, f, i have a gf, and am curious (about life). 

 So, my main OCD “quirks” you could say, are obsessing over self harm, suicide, P-OCD (i still hate saying the word), and relationship ocd. I’ve always had depression since i can remember. For panic disorder, i would just have meltdowns if i ever had high stress or even low stress occasionally (all throughout elementary school i would have breakdowns i couldn’t control, and i was completely fine beforehand). I’ve recently started developing agoraphobia, well to the extent that it’s at currently. 

 The PTSD is one that i believe i have a minor case of. I went through a traumatic experience during middle school that spanned the entire 3 years. 

 But the bipolar, i have no say on really, as I’m not really well informed about that disorder. 

 There are things that i do that haven’t been brought up to past therapists, and i dont know why i never did. 
 
 I have this odd thing where CB i copy/mimic/feel things I’ve recently seen, or when i think of it, i start to mimic again. I’ve always done this for as long as i can remember. I’m not sure if this is a “childlike” trait that hasn’t worn off yet or if it’s something i should be worried about. 

 To give an example from a recent event, i watched a Tourettes Twitch streamer compilation (sweet Anita i believe is her name) and as i was watching it, i would metaphorically absorb and mimic some of the tics she has (flipping off randomly, twitching your head) even though i don’t have Tourettes. This would last maybe ten to twenty minutes afterwards, and would stop. Unless i thought about it later on, which would trigger me to do it a couple times more before stopping. 

 Another example is when i went to see The Rise of Skywalker a couple weeks ago. I surprisingly really enjoyed the movie (as the previous one was a dumpster fire imo), and about twenty minutes into the movie, i started feeling weird. I sort of dissociate and project myself into the characters in a way? Any thoughts i had during the movie was in Rey’s voice. Any thoughts i had for the rest of the day were in Rey’s voice. I could visualize her saying it, and what body movement she would have during it. Even though i knew it wasn’t real, i would have this underlying feeling that i was the one experiencing the emotions, that i was, in fact, Rey, and all of her past is what has happened to me. But, my personality traits still came through. I was still very much so acting very gay in my mind, i still had my anxious thoughts, my depressing thoughts, and anything else i had, but with Rey’s baggage on top of it. 

 I’m not sure how well I’m describing it, but it’s the best i can currently do. 

 There is another thing i have, that I’ve brought up once when i was having a checkup with my psychiatrist. I call it “frequently occurring long moment of impeding doom and self harm mental imagery”. So, i have these 30-60 minute long moments of time, about every day to every other day, where my mood completely drops, i have a void of emotional confusion i fall in to, and all my negative thoughts are essentially on cocaine. To give you an idea of a moment where it really made me realize, was when my sister was over during winter and was helping my mom decorate the Christmas tree. I had just finished getting the decorations down from the attic, and to the downstairs living room. I open one of the boxes, and grab an ornament. I was ready and excited to start decorating; watching my sister set up the stockings, when i feel dread hit me. 

 My heart rate either quickens or slows down, my blood feels cold, it becomes harder for me to register things happening around me as if it was in real time, my hands become shaky and my knees weak (arms are heavy, theres vomit on his sweater already, moms spaghetti), and i feel all my suicidal thoughts spike. I put the ornament back where i got, and i stand there. I can feel my heart beating, i hyper fixate on the act of breathing. Its like i was launched into space, but like uncomfortable space, y’know? I went to my room, laid down, held my dog close to me, and just sat there feeling my veins pumping. 

 I called my girlfriend, who has seen these moments before, and immediately i felt more secure in the fact i wasn’t going to commit suicide (she was distracting me from my thoughts, or helped me feel better about them). She would talk about the guitar lesson from that week, or what song i had written recently, or even just talk about breakfast foods. Most of the time though, we’re both silent the entire duration of those moments as i occasionally tell her what my thoughts were. 

 Then, after that long moment passes by, i felt fine, albeit that i was emotionally exhausted and needy for physical intimacy. I start to obsess over the thought of my gf and i cuddling with no clothes on, and physical intimacy with no sexual purpose of it. Just skin touching. I wanted that reassurance that reality is real. I just wanted reassurance that i wouldnt do anything. 

 Now, imagine these moments every other day, and triggered from absolutely nothing (that im aware of). Sometimes they’re this bad, sometimes not so much, there’s never a solid pattern of intensity. 

 That’s about all that comes to mind as I’m writing this, but I’ll add some additional information if it could help in figuring out what these stem from. 

 I was officially diagnosed in August of last year, and the therapists diagnosis was the couple months following that. I was put on Sertraline (Zoloft) a week after my official diagnosis. After ten weeks in therapy, my insurance didn’t allot more sessions. As of a week and a half ago, i am transitioning to Prozac as i have no improvements on Zoloft. 

 Since all of that is... a mood dropper, I’ll talk about my interests for a few seconds.

 Ive played guitar for 5 years, and have been doing classical the past year. I also sing, and have written my own music. I feel most confident when I’m singing or playing guitar, and i can express my emotions connected to my mental health with the lyrics i write. I also like to write fiction occasionally. 

 Soo... yeah. Hopefully you people of reddit can help me make sense of my issues.

but maybe two or three days after I'll feel normal again and forget about this until this happens again and the cycle goes on and on and on
I'm not just talking about the sad memories being temporary , it goes both the ways.

we always try to balance out the sad and happy times and expect everything to be good at the end but the sad part is that even if we're happy at the end of the day We're not prepared for the coming sadness the future holds.

Anyone is welcome to participate but I would prefer it if people who are not from the UK only talk about their specific healthcare processes/systems if relevant to a comments discussion rather than promoting it - just so we dont get swamped out/conflicting information due to uneven population. 

I'm keeping the sub active mainly through posting mental health news articles but eventually hoping it can be a more varied sub where people can either ask questions, talk with like minded people, give support, vent or promote their own blogs or work if related to mental health/therapy.

I've tried to look up information about first person versus third person memory but haven't found it particularly helpful. Everything I find keeps talking about remembering older memories in third person, like childhood memories. Articles also talk about experiencing third person perspective with memories that are unclear or that you are detached from (as in observing your past self as separate from yourself now), but none of that fits me at all. Even my most recent memories that I remember in fresh detail, like my memories from just yesterday, are in third person. I don't feel detached from myself in these memories either, I very much still go through my thoughts and emotions in my recent memories despite the third person perspective. I haven't really found anything helpful yet that describes what my brain is doing, which is storing every memory in third person regardless of any other detail, so if anyone has any perspective on this it'd be really helpful to understanding it.",08Feb2020,1

117,"This is my 3rd or 4th attempt at writing a post.
Some with my history some without.

I will just ask a question, and I guess leave a bit of an explanation.. However please be warned It may sound a bit nuts.. 

Does anybody else go through what feels like routined phazes of losing there mind? 

Briefly what I mean.. I have been playing with the idea of just packing some supplies and ditching my life with no warning to anyone.. I am questioning my relationship, but I will be happy with it again soon ( I will just be happyily content again) and not even want to remeber this 'episode' I have no outlets, (job or anything creative. Things I want to do I have no idea how to do them, I have past trauma that There is no help for me, I am on my own to deal with it.. I'm too old for some help and too young (mid twentys) to be feeling this way and to be so lost. I feel like I am not who I am meant to be, that I am a lost resource to society also and That I fake my life that I have to fit in with what is normalish or accepted, I feel suicidal ish I guess but I know I want to just live my life more but I also have no intrest in trying?? Maybe thats just no motivation left.. As I always keep trying.. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me.
I have had deppression and anxiety, and I am on the Spectrum apprently.. I don't believe the diagnosis all that much.. I know I sound depressed,  but it feels different from depression,  More dangerous and possibly more destructive.

My heart rate has been elevated all day.
My sleep was perfectly good which is unusual.
I fequently have mini existential crisis's as well, these are becoming more common I think..

I do feel like my energy is starting to drain, which could mean I'm calming down. I felt like curling up and sleeping the day away earlyier, sometimes that helps but this keeps recurring ?

Almost like it has a schedule to come back.

Any ideas.. Anyone feel like this at all?",08Feb2020,1

120,"My adult  stepson moved out of our house a couple of weeks ago. A few days prior to that we were with him in an emergency room and he responded to the questions about wanting to hurt himself and others with a yes. This was a big shock to my husband and I, since we'd never heard anything about this. We also weren't sure if we could believe it. He's a pathological liar (I believe) and was definitely thrilled to be in an emergency room feeling like he was the center of attention. 

He said that he has lots (not sure if he used the word ""constant"") intrusive thoughts of hurting people. When the nurse walked away my husband questioned him hard, but he didn't back down. He maintained that he has intrusive thoughts of harming others, wouldn't specify who those people are (even though he never leaves the house, so he basically only sees his parents, younger brother and boyfriend), and claimed that he has complete and absolute control over himself and so would never actually hurt anyone. Although, any other time you talk to him, he will happily tell you that he is very impulsive and doesn't make short or long term plans. 

He's been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist since October. So, he is under treatment. I don't know what his diagnosis is. He won't tell us anything beyond depression and anxiety. In the weeks before and after he started therapy, he was talking a lot about sociopaths and their symptoms. I also found out that he told his boyfriend that he was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder as a child (obvious lie). I don't know if he's a sociopath. In my opinion he certainly has narcissistic personality disorder. He meets all of the 9 criteria. 

So, he has thoughts of hurting people. He moved out a couple of weeks ago under tense circumstances. He just packed a bag and left. My husband and daughter packed up the things in his room. At that time, my daughter found lighter fluid in his room. The kind you use to light a charcoal grill. My husband said that my son had wanted to do some trick he'd seen online and needed the lighter fluid. I'd been worried about him huffing it. 

Today our toaster oven malfunctioned and filled our kitchen with smoke. The first thing I noticed was that our fire alarm was missing. I questioned every adult in the house and no one removed that fire alarm. It had to have been my son. There's no reason for him to have removed that alarm. He doesn't cook and even if he was to cook something, burn it, and make the fire alarm go off, the standard practice in our home is to wave a dishtowel at it until it turns off. 

He's admitted to having a problem with thoughts of hurting people and the fire alarm is missing? He had lighter fluid in his bedroom? There's no telling what he could have been planning. 

My husband isn't taking this seriously and that's making me feel like I'm jumping to conclusions. I just can't think of any legit reason for that fire alarm to be gone. I'm not even sure what I'm looking for here. Just opinions. I'm not thinking of calling the authorities or anything. Should I assume that my son had plans to set the house and fire and harm us? Should I just ignore this? I just don't know what to do. 

And there's no talking to him. He isn't communicating with us right now and even if he was, he'd just lie. The thought that he was planning to harm our home and/or kill us is just piling sadness on top of sadness.",08Feb2020,1

123,"Sorry if this post doesn’t have a great structure, I’m just going to write about how I feel because I really need to let it out. I want to say that this goes into detail about my emotional struggles, mentions self harm and suicidal ideation. So if you’re sensitive to that please don’t read this, I don’t want to hurt anyone else. 

I’m in pain. So, so much pain. I don’t remember a time when I wasn’t experiencing anxiety or depression. Even when I was a kid, around 8 years old, I was hospitalised because of severe stomach cramps and suspected ulcers. The diagnosis was stress. I was literally stressing myself into a hospital bed as a child. I feel my anxiety every day, emotionally and physically. My resting heart rate is around 95-100bpm and I’m physically fit. I feel it sometimes as if it’s about to burst out of my chest, then bam, full blown panic attack that can leave me shaking for an hour. I feel nauseous every time I eat. I struggle to sleep and when I do, I have nightmares all the time that sometimes leave me waking up in pools of sweat, in tears or even gasping for breath. 

Then it’s the depression. I can wake up fine, then it might hit around 4pm, 6pm, anytime, and all of a sudden that’s it. My interest in the things I like is gone, I just blankly stare at whatever is happening around me and count down the time until I can try to go to sleep. This doesn’t happen everyday, but maybe 4/7 days a week, or I’ll wake up feeling bad and it’ll be the reverse. My mood just changes with no warning, I’ll just feel this sinking deep down inside me and I know it’s done. Sometimes I just feel my eyes well up with tears when I’m sat in a room alone. I always let it go dark around me accidentally because I don’t even notice it until I have a random moment like having to go to the bathroom. It’s like nothing matters. Nothing that I do, say, or am matters. I’m so lost. I have had this happen on and off for as long as I can remember. I take everything so personally, people can upset me so easily and I find it hard to trust anyone, especially with these sorts of emotions. Only one person knows a little bit about it and I hate it because I think they’ll probably not want to stick around knowing how difficult I might be to care for if they knew the full extent. I don’t show what I’m feeling though, I try to hide it. I’d just be a burden to everyone around me. 

At other periods in my life, fuck sometimes even all in the same day, I get so excited and feel ready to take on the world. I sign up for tonnes of shit, commit to learning a language, taking up a hobby or anything, and then it’s just gone again. No motivation, no more belief in myself. I go from believing I could take on anything to barely being able to motivate myself to get a fucking shower. I can’t concentrate on anything, I never have had a good attention span and I get bored so quickly so I just start tapping or looking around the room whenever I try to do something. 

I’m in so much pain. Even if it goes away for a while it comes back and it hurts so much. I haven’t self harmed in over 6 years but the closest I’ve come is this week. To anyone reading this, I just want to say thank you for letting me tell you how I’m feeling. No body knows how much I’m hurting. Everyone thinks I’m okay but I’m a mess. I’m sorry to anyone who relates to what I’m saying, because I know what it’s like. I feel like my own mind is torturing me. What’s wrong with me? I just want it to stop",08Feb2020,1

133,"Hi there. I don't know if this is the right place to ask this but I've been looking for some kind of answer in Google and I haven't found anything substantial. I've started to suspect I might be gaslighting my partner. It's weird to feel that I might be manipulating and even damaging him without intention or actual knowledge of doing so, but I've noticed than more and more often he apologizes to me and says that I'm always right, and our discussions always end up being just him feeling stupid and inferior. I dont insult him, or yell at him. I don't feel good when he admits to being wrong or feeling dumber than me, I don't feel good when we discuss at all, but idk sometimes I hear him repeating over and over the same ideas or sentiments of inferiority in contrast to me being so bright and well spoken. Sometimes I'll find myself not understanding how he can be so sensitive or upset because of something I said jokingly, and even think to myself that he's overreacting even if I dont tell him because I dont want to minimize his feelings, but the fact that I think about it, or that sometimes I can be pretty critical of some of his friends, or get annoyed at him for reminding me to do something we both know I should be doing, and then he apologizes and I feel bad because I know he shouldn't be apologizing, and thats makes me think that maybe I do this more often than I realize or even in a more damaging way. I thought about this too in a previous relationship, and talked to my then partner but he reassured me saying that it was just him being dumb, not me manipulating him into thinking so. Still I'm worried to notice it again in this new relationship and I'd like to know your thoughts on this and, if anyone knows, how to recognize it if/when I'm doing it and stop it, because it breaks my heart to think that I might be actually abusing my partner, or even other people, and not doing anything about it.

Thank you everyone who commented or sent me supportive messages before. I have finished my last therapy session and keeping this monthly update is massively important to me on my journey to better myself and maintain my mental health.

I used to catatrophise events every day and cry every day in the shower or in bed. Recently I have not been crying for 20 days now and I have tried to stick to my new routines/habits as mentioned in the original post. 

Keeping up with new habits was really difficult. I used this method  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bxIg3M\_MHY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bxIg3M_MHY) in the video to keep track but I realized I could not really keep up with them. The method in the video allowed me to analyse why I was unable to keep up - it was work. I am such a workaholic that wanting to feel successful at work has dominated my mind and my life. I started to take a step back from work. I started to feel I have become lazier (and i do not feel good about it) but I do realize that my mental health has started to improve. I am enjoying work more now, and I feel happier at work because I know that work is not my whole life. I still work hard, that is why I could not keep up with my habits but at least I know the reason and I can now do something about it. I will keep trying to stick to my habits, no matter how difficult it is. It is very difficult to strike a balance between work and life but I shall keep trying.

I also realized that I have made poor decisions in my relationships that contributed to insecurities and worse mental health. I am proactively looking to cutting off multiple relationships that might be hindering me and I am hoping to start over again with my relationships. 

Thank you to anyone who read this. This does not say much or help people much but it definitely helps me to keep track of my mental health and better myself as a person. 

Thank you again.",08Feb2020,1

148,"I used to have crippling anxiety all the time; I would get random spikes of adrenaline, find myself trembling in the middle of the day, and just constantly weary of everyone/thing around me. Paranoid that I was going to be abducted or end up in a mass shooting everytime I left the house. But for the past year or so...I haven’t felt any fear or apprehension? I’m not scared of anything conventional (snakes/spiders/heights/open water/etc), they just don’t bother me. I’m no longer scared of people, I have been walking places by myself in the middle of the night (admittedly I know this is dangerous). I used to sit up all night due to nightmares or an inability to fall asleep. 
 
The only thing I even feel that resembles fear is like nerves when hanging out with someone I’m romantically interested in, but that’s not really fear cause I’m happy to be in the situation. I sleep phenomenally - usually falling asleep in less than 5 minutes and staying asleep all night. 

Is it weird to suddenly not feel fear or anxiety? Even in situations where I may be in some kind of danger? What could have made everything stop?

My bf has been going downhill the last 7 months, and I’m not sure how to help. What makes things especially difficult is his severe social anxiety. Making phone calls, going anywhere where there are people, going to appointments... it’s so stressful for him. 

I know I’m not responsible for fixing him, but I am the only one willing to help. My own mental health has been deteriorating, so I’ve been trying to work on myself too.

I’m in therapy and taking medication (which I’m hoping to discontinue because I don’t feel like myself).

150,"Hello. 

I've been sexually assaulted three times involving five different men. First at 12, then 15, and then 22 years old. I am 24 years old now. I have no idea how to get the help I need, I feel resentment and anger towards my loving boyfriend who does not deserve it. After the first attack at 12, I began to drink alone in secret. This developed into a drinking problem. I am beginning AA meetings and have pledged to quit drinking as it triggers this anger inside of me. My boyfriend has become resentful for my angry outbursts. I can't help him see that they are not meant for him, and that I blackout and this anger comes out of nowhere. Now, he is resentful and scared of me, which makes me even more angry. I know drinking is what triggers this the most, but I don't know how to get past this all.

I'm terrified that no one will believe me, or say that I'm being dramatic because I try to research symptoms in attempt to understand why I'm like this. (undiagnosed currently, but I have a solid grasp on the why this is happening, and a rough idea of what could be a potential diagnosis)

I'm scared that I'll be treated like shit, but this is due to past experiences with medical professionals/crisis workers. I don't trust them. 

I'm scared that I'll never be the same, even though I know that's the whole point of getting this fixed. I've been dealing with this since I was 13... Nearly 20 years. I'm scared that it'll turn out that I don't even know who I am. 

I'm scared that even if I initiate help, that by the time the bottleneck opens, and an appointment becomes available, I will be in the middle of an episode and I just won't go.

I'm terrified that I'll just be locked away and forgotten about. 

I feel ashamed that I'm the only one in my family who has these troubles... Or it seems that way to me. I know I cant speak for them, of course, and everyone has their own struggles.

155,"Hi everyone. I'd like your input on a personal matter.

Long story short. I've always suspected I have OCD. Ever since elementary school I've dealt with major and minor obsessions. My most recent one has to do with overanalysing details about everyday life in the form of a doubt. Things that most of the time I find kind of uncomfortable talking about.

I should also point out that due to bad decisions and, I guess, some form of apathy I'm currently in my early 20s, still living with parents, never have had a relationship and no job. Quite a sheltered lifestyle.

I'm not a professional, though, so I can't self diagnose. Thus I decided to go a psychiatrist because I was more interested in a formal diagnosis. I have been to a couple of psychologists and they weren't that helpful and clear.

I went to this lady and she explained that I do indeed have compulsions but the bigger problem is my relationship with my parents. She said that my parents have been wrongly overprotective and my dad has been authoritarian. But she didn't just mention it. She was really really brutally honest about it. It involved straight up telling me the issue in a slightly angry and sarcastic manner. She joked about how instead of being out with friends I'm inside doing stuff with my parents. She criticised my parents' decisions in life in a sarcastic manner and was quite judgemental. At the end, she also kept asking me ""Will you see me again?"" to test whether I was willing to start therapy. Only when I left she was more sympathetic, didn't take a lot of money and said that she really wants to see me again.

I feel like shit now. I've started having doubts about my parents to the point where I feel like I should be avoiding them. I also feel like a loser and I'm getting even more obsessions and compulsions. I've had minor stomach ache ever since I saw her a couple days ago. It's a big mess. Do you think that maybe she's not good for me? Was what she did wrong? I really don't know if I should see her again or not (already booked a second appointment but still). I'm not asking you to tell me what to do. Just share your opinion on the problem.

Thanks in advance :(",08Feb2020,1

157,"I was diagnosed 10 years ago, am medicated (low doses of seroquel, lamtrogine, lexapro, alongside valium and serapax (for when things are really bad) but it still lingers. I go into all consuming emotional vortexs (a day to 6 weeks) am constantly in a low with my own thoughts (which turn into depression, worry, panic) and I have no regard of the consequences of buying things = debt. I have a very good high paying job so i guess you'd say i am high functioning. If I am around people I am very positive, the life of the party so to speak but when alone it's a completely different story.

Although I have very good friends, most weekends are spent alone with my thoughts (by choice). Generally it is a low feeling. None of my friends would know all the above is going on for me - i keep it to myself) If I don't do high intensity exercise at least four times a week I unravel greatly.

It should not be this way but it is. The only people who have been there for me and loved me unconditionally have been partners. Otherwise it's all talk and never actually anyone being there. I tell people I'm depressed and they just brush it off. I'm moving out of state soon and all these people come out of the woodwork and act like they have been here for me this whole time, FUCK OFF. 

I honestly have come to hate everyone and everything. Even my doctor is a shit head. I called and said I had been extremely depressed for six months and I need an antidepressant.

159,"I can have real issues because of boredom. 

When I'm not living life in a rigid pattern ,bit more freedom , less repetition in very tedious boring ways . The effect is I'm more productive and more content 


When the result creates boredom it has a lasting impact. 

For example ,I sit in on a very boring and unnecessarily tedious seminar to the point everyone in the room is getting pissed off.

For me when I experience something this boring it seems to downregulate my dopamine levels so low that for the next few days I'm chronically bored and nothing seems to stimulate it . When I'm in this state it's like trying to look through a brick wall . There's is nothing in the future only the here and now and I am stumped with boredom .

This worries me as life can generally be pretty boring sometimes . Especially work, and life becomes the here and now persevere day to day ,trying to look through a brick wall, bored as fuck .

Usually I need a few kicks of dopamine here and there to elevate and come through boredom and the long-term plans come through . 

For me and boredom I live day to day because boredom restricts my wider view if this makes sense .

160,"Stay in my room until work, either sleeping the whole time or manic af from lack of sleep and minimal drug use. Not good i know but i have to start being honest at least w myself if im ever going to seek help 
I found this year that i enjoy dulling down my reality instead of facing problems. 

 Drugs give me a temporary false belief that i am smart or happy, or looking as good as i feel.. just makes me feel happy, like how i should feel naturally.
I don't want to escape as much as i want to numb my thoughts from hurting myself. When my thoughts become verbal my moods lash out on others and it makes me hate my existence that much more. 
Which triggers a wave of suicidal thoughts, self doubt, and a can't do attitude. 
I just give up
I am sick and tired of holding the weight of these ideations within the thin barriers of my skull, im growing old and tierd.
When it started, i thought i brought these thoughts into my head, and i would feel shame for it. For why am i doing this to myself?
6 years later its gotten progressively worse, i quit drinking and began a regaulr pill regimen  (also smoking marajuana) to keep myself balanced, or calm. I was less on edge, found a bit of happiness within myself and my creative side and began to feel human again. 
Now the flip side to that is the rap sheet of side effects that come along with these pills.
Stabalize your mind, sacrifice your body.
It's taking a chance everytime, adverse reactions and misdiagnosis over those 6 years didn't help. By the timei was aged 25 i had been on or around 25 different pills and different combinations within of those pills. 
By the end of my 6 years medication tweaking process, and 3 misdiagnosis, 6 hospitalizations, and pretty much a team of specialists, and a dozen doctors,  along w a cat scan of my brain in 2014.
It took hell of a toll on my body, and brain functions. My liver an kidneys wont last forever..
The runaround, a serious uphill battle im still pushing through..learning a lot about my mind and mostly thought process.
Why am i so mean to myself? 

 and as of today my diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder bi polar type, i struggle with anxiety (mostly social) and frequent panic attacks (which can be triggered by the way someone i know looks me wrong) me being called sensitive would be a huge understatement. Around the time of my first hospitalization in 2009 i witnessed my friend and roommate at the time get beat within an inch from his life with brass knuckles to the face. 
I remember nothing past the porch where he laid still, getting beat on our own front lawn repeatedly. 
My mind permanently blocked that from me.Next time i have a memory from that moment im looking over him-- laying in the blood soaked grass, in total shock. His face was a blood puddle, in panic mode i went and scooped him from his back to his feet. At that second i embraced his tall frail figure as his wounds dripped down onto my suicidal tendencies shirt (oh the irony)  my arms wrapped all the way around his body, for i just wanted him to feel safty or comfort. Grabbing him by the hand i guidedus to a safer space indoors.
Around me was a blur, friends and neighbors scolded me, for ""he could have a neck or back injury! Leave him laying!"" 
I was not only in shock, but also processing a violent and traumatic event that changed my life forever. 
I was scared, he was petrified. 
I told all the neighbors and by standers basically to fuck off and
As for my friend- now gushing blood from his cuts, eye sockets, mouth and nose. 
just like a skipping cd in your old walkman, he was stuck in a constant shuddering loop fearing for his life. 
""They're going to come back and kill me""
Over and over and over and over..
Once into our house i lead him into the bathroom, swiftly locking the door behind.
""Call 911, they're going to come back and kill me"" again and again as he ran water over his face, pressing his broken bone structure completely flat, blood pouring from all parts of his kind and beautiful face. 
He couldn't feel it, he could barely process what had happened, for it happened so fast. 
I watched him try to
Rinse all the blood away only more would streamout.&amp;Panic struck, the ambulance was now on its way but inwas starting to expierence by first delusion. 
After that summer i didn't see my friend again until 10 years later. 
What i said to him was, i have been through so much since then that stemmed from that dark moment in our past, struggled with literal demons inside my head, woken up to images of corpses laying in my bed. 
But i will never know how you managed to stay so strong, so beautiful, and so kind even after something so awful could happen. 
I have no idea how he did it i said, how he pulled through and came out on top.
Dude, he could have been beat to death if someone hadn't stepped in. 

One of the moments that shaped me, made me grow and helped me learn so much about myself id never had gotten the chance to if our paths may not have crossed. 
Cos i usually think ""man, i wonder what life would've became if these blips in time hadn't happened at all?""
Maybe id have some sort of success, or maybe just no chronic disorder that effects almost every aspect of my life in some sort of way. Im unsure, always wonder, then feel weak minded.
Soon after we went through this i found myself laying on my bare bed, last nights last breath escapingaway as the mourning sun crept through the crack in the window where the card board had shifted.
I stayed home all alone with my thoughts that night. 
Not knowing how many sleepless nights, and waking nightmares mixed with violent hallucinations id have ahead of me. 
The mind is a very fragile thing, science knows little about mental illness as it is-so to see me, 4 or 5 days later after that night, days became weeks then into one bad blurred summer.
To explain it all in full detail wouldn't make any sense whatsoever -but i basically looked like your local circle k crack head on no sleep talking to the air. 
Sad thing is, mental illness and drug addiction look a whole lot alike. 
Your brain looses one to many days of sleep then all the sudden i think im related to  Egyptian gods, and my brother is a cannabal living on an ancient Indian burial ground, and theres a government drone disguised as a house fly watching me.
The house was alive, and teeth snapped my feet at every step.
The windows were breathing. I sawa glimpse of a body on the stain in the laundry room, had conversations with hairless rats and sat in a chair crafted from hitlers bones.
I could feel the chill air pass, i felt negative spirits, saw shadow people while christmas carolers sang outside my door.
None of this was real, this was just a snipit of the things i've seen and heard but told they weren't really there. 
I was awake, yet dreaming in gruesome splashes and disorganized thoughts. 
I was alive to exist. 
I felt pain all over.
Once admited i was so unrulyi wasn't able to be near any other patients at least half a day to a day. I spent that time in the yellow hallway in the nude and a pair of flats, pissing on myself while flooding my room. 
When they brought my food, i ripped my name badge from the tray. I ate my name for dinner, refused the meal, kicking it across the hallway.
Water began to trickle out of my room, and by the time they asked me to get dressed they saw..
I shoved all the sheets, blankets and my clothes into the toilet, and sink only to keep them running and flushing til someone decided to check on my crazy naked ass.
I just didnt want to be alone.
So i made sure they had to keep me close, and segregating an unstable lil girl who wants to die and has no clue what reality is anymore is inhumane. 
I spent the next 3 weeks there making no damn sence, i was completely detached from reality coloring with crayons, banging my head inbetween the door way and the wall. 
It hurt everywhere in a different way, but they couldnt make it stop so i would hurt myself. 
I hadn't showered in over a week, 2 nurses insisted on helping me bathe. 
Once in the water all i could do was scream, cry and fight them.
I was 20.

I feel like my intuition is always at war with logic. My thought process always seems so conflicted, but it my perception always makes room for other options. I mean, isn’t that empathy?

I think this hurts me at work. I think that this is hurting me at home. Work is hurting me and I’m bringing it home and it’s hurting my relationship with my husband. He’s very assertive and I love that about him, but it makes it very hard for me to feel seen and understood. He can take anything that I’m upset about and make it about himself and frame it as abusive even though I haven’t said anything that attacks his character. The only thing that is abusive is that I’m frustrated by the fact that the company I work for is a plummeting shithole, the management is interested in only pocketing the money and not interested in making improvements that’ll save money. I’ve shared good ideas, had them shut down, only for them to implement them without involving me later on at head office and continue to let my branch get away with being reactive and underachieving, while I’m scrambling to try to keep things in order without having the appropriate tools or support to do it. 

I’m in the process of giving up right now. I’ve got glowing reference letters. But I’ve been trying to find a new job for almost a year now and now I’m scared that I’m too depressed to even look attractive to a prospective employer (I’m waiting for exam intakes to happen, until I can earn the credentials that I’ve been studying for, for the last 4 years. Classes ended in November. Tests are in August.) I guess I’m just really past my resistance threshold and feel totally hopeless that an answer will come before it’s too late. 

I’ve got ADHD, if Rejection Dysphoria is a real DSM thing, then I’ve definitely got that. And I’m just....so sad.

I'm good friends with her but I'm sick of always listening to her self-depricating, I mean self-hatred and all and I know this sounds like me being a total douche but please hear me out. She recently started to see a therapist weekly which is great, but I'm not sure how much it will help because I fear she might not be able to be really honest and I don't know if talking about her problems really helps her of if she just dwells in how fucked her life is. Seriously, it makes me angry but what makes me most angry is that her parents had unprotected sex because her parents are like massively unwell themselves, her mom is weirdly abusive, they fight all the time, she controls her life, she says she is exactly like her and her grandmother but she also feels weirdly connected with them and her mom texts her every morning and every evening and demands replies (she's 21 and lives like 400km away from home) and I'm just crying internally because there is so much wrong in this family and I fear my friend will never be free from all this shit and will never be happy because she cannot let go and just makes humorous self-depricating jokes about it and it makes me sick.

I don't know what to do. I thought about writing her a long letter where I lay out a bit more that being okay is possible and how good it would be for her to take some time out and go to a mental facility. She actually also talked about it with me how she thinks this is generally a good idea, but on the other hand she thinks that all the facilities are like pretty bad. I guess this is true to some extent but I just wish she could see it's not about the best facility but about taking a time out and exploring what else you can be and what there is more to life.

I guess I'll try to explain that to her in greater detail but I just wish she could change because it's so hard. The best thing you can do for your friends is getting well yourself. Nothing is harder for others to deal with than your constant self-hatred. I wish she could be free. Thanks for reading",08Feb2020,1

Hello Reddit,

My family and I live in North Carolina, USA (in case this is relevant).  I am writing this post because I need help figuring out how to help my brother.  He is 33 years old, and was diagnosed by his psychiatrist almost 10 years ago with schizophrenia.  This past year, a different doctor diagnosed him with Type 1 Bipolar with Delusions of Grandeur.  He has experienced mania and psychosis on many different occasions, and is currently in a mental hospital after his most recent battle with psychosis. 

He tends to repeat a regular cycle with his disease which follows as: Manic state, leading into psychosis, sometimes catatonic states, leading into a hospital/ER admission in which they force him to take his prescription medication.  After stabilizing him at the hospital, he is traditionally transferred to a mental hospital for a few weeks where they feed him, administer medication, and provide therapy.  His states of mania and psychosis tend to fade away after a few weeks (though the delusions of grandeur traditionally stay), and they release him to family.  

He has had some success staying on medication when my parents are constantly vigilant, but eventually he decides that he either does not need to take his medicine either because he believes that he is cured or does not want to take his medicine because they make him depressed/suicidal.  Eventually he stops taking his medication, and the gradual decline of his mental health begins again until he reaches another state of mania and psychosis.  

We have tried many different methods of helping him.  Hospital and mental hospital stays, a program called Inner Fire in Vermont, constant parental vigilance to name a few.  Our entire family is desperate for answers.  One idea that I was considering was having my parents gain legal guardianship over my brother, and then dictate that he takes an injectable medicine that requires much less vigilance than it otherwise would in pill form.  I don’t even know if that option is possible since he has never proven himself to be a danger to others (though he would likely end up on the streets if my parents completely stopped intervening.)  

TL;DR: My brother is mentally ill and our family wants to help him the best and most effective way we know how.  Is guardianship/forced medication possible? Are there other alternatives that seem to work well with these types of patients?  Any legal advice, help, advice of any other kind is very much welcomed.  Thank you.",08Feb2020,1
174,"My dad is controlling and emotionally manipulating. 

I broke contact with my family a few years ago because they drained me emotionally and didn’t let me be my own person. 

I’m now in contact with everyone exept my mom. My dad was nice at first but has been slipping into the same habits again. 

I live alone (I’m in my 20s) 

I tell him things like ”I’ll call you later this week”  then he’ll call me when he feels like it anyway.

He calls me up to vent about his problems even though he knows how mentally unstable I am. When I try to set boundries he gets pissy and start acting like a victim and tells me how hard it is to deal with me. 

He tells me when I should contact the rest of my family, I’ve tried telling him that I can decide myself when and how I contact other people but he ignores this and start bringing up reasons why I should call them (”she’s sick, he’s old ” etc. He pressures me to drop everything and contact them as quickly as possible. 

He keeps talking about all the bad things my mom does even though I don’t want to hear it. 

He never stops talking, he keeps repeating his lectures and his venting and it drives me insane. 

He makes a big deal out of small things. He treats me like a child and everything always have to be about his wishes and feelings. 

It got so bad yesterday that I got drunk and cut myself. I even called a suicide hotline because I couldn’t deal with it. 

He doesn’t respect me as an adult even though I’ve told him time and time again to stop telling me how to live my life. 

I’m so stressed out because I can’t see a way out. Confronting him scares me to death because he can snap out of nowhere when he doesn’t get his way. 

What to do?",08Feb2020,1

176,"Recently I've been going through some rough times: A girl broke my heart, I've been feeling alone and useless, I haven't been enjoying my job and I just sleep all the time whenever I can but still I feel tired... Next tot that I started eating less and feel guilty whenever I do.

About a week ago I started talking about it with my brother and a friend. I've been trying to get through this but I feel like whatever I do is pointless...

One of the things I started doing was walking. I do it during my lunch breaks, when I come home from work and in the weekends. Whenever I'm walking on the sidewalk, I notice myself drifting towards the street. I'm constantly hoping a car will hit me and stop it all. I know it's bad to think that but to be quite honest: I simply don't care.

Should I be worried or is this just a side effect of the time I've been going through?",08Feb2020,1
177,"Just to clarify: I (15M) live mived to UK. I live with my mom and stepdad.

My mom texted me that tomorrow we will talk the situation through.
We didn't talk a lit for 3 days. Just esentials like: I'm going to the store or I'm going to eat (insert random food name here)
3 days ago we had a talk about the situation witb school and she said ""Why do you let it get to you?""
And I just lost it and said ""WHY!?, Well, because I'm nit like you! I can't just let every insult slide.
And then she said ""But why?""
And I just gave up.
Seeing that she doesn't understand...noone undestands...just hurt.
Then I told her that I give up on everything. And walked away.
This month left me drained.
I started self harming for now 8 days.
My hobbies feel empty and while I still can laugh at a meme I feel mostly dull.
I gave up on everything...school...myself.
I have literally noone to trust now...I'm alone...at least now I won't be hurt anymore...
In school I've been called retard and a lot if other stuff.
Existing hurts...but I don't have a courage to end it all...do self harm is my only way to feel...
We stoped talking when she came fo my room and told me that I'm not giving up on school. I then told her that when I said that I give up on everything, I ment everything.
I am not scared of throwing it all away.
If I can't defend myself in school phisyically or verbally against bullies (When the bastard hit me in the shouleder with a fist during class and I told him ""You idiot"". They fucking blamed me too!)
and I can't even express my emotions on this at home...then I'm done...I'm done with everything...trusting people...and giving up on myself.
I considered telling her about my self harm in a month and half...but no. Noone will ever know.
And now she says that tomorrow will talk this through and that talking sorts things out...I gave school 2 chances to fix this shit storm through talking and then betrayed my trust...I asked my mom for a week to send a fucking mail to school...but she sent it 3 days ago...it was too late...and now she want to talk it over! Fuck that.
She even had the audacity to ask me if I don't like it in UK I can alwqys go live with my dad in the country I come from. I just replied with: ""I would rather kill myself before living with him."" He is an alcoholic bastard who doesn't care about me and basically left me.
Tbh, I'm just done. 3 days ago she said that there's something wrong with me when i told her I give up...she basically called me crazy...I will never forgive her...anyone...
I gave up and nothing will change it...I've been pushed too far...and I don't give a damn about anyine telling me not to give up...I don't even care about the conciquences.",08Feb2020,1
178,Usually people say once you start planning out exactly what your going to do is when you should get help. I don’t think there has been many days where I haven’t had thoughts and ruminations of suicide. My job is delivering parts and at least every day I think about driving off the edge of a bridge or into something. I’d never go through but I really can’t stop them they’re my normal at this point. It’s funny to think that normal people don’t think like this everyday. So when is enough enough?,08Feb2020,1

180," Hi all. So I realise that the internet is no place for a diagnosis, but I know you guys know your stuff so I was hoping some of you might be able to point me in the right direction.

About 5 days ago, after a fairly crappy night of sleep (4 hours), I was sitting at a table using my phone when I realised that I had stopped recognising my hands. It felt like I was watching someone's hands use my phone. My eyes darted over to investigate, and after a few seconds my brain readjusted and they looked like they were mine again. This was weird to me, but I blamed it on my shitty sleep the night before. FFW to today, it happens constantly. Whenever I'm focusing on whatever I'm doing, my arms and hands detach until I look at them for a few seconds. It's happening as I type this.

Last night I had a very paranoid experience. I was finishing up in the bathroom getting ready to sleep, and turned off the light, which happened to be the last night on in the house. Now, I'm not normally scared of the dark, but last night was not normal. I felt intense fear and paranoia (like someone was going to attack me in the darkness). I ran into my room as fast as I could and turned the light on. I almost had a panic attack from those 3 seconds of exposure to darkness. Now, what DID give me a panic attack, was when I decided to sleep and hallucinated a phantom hand waving at me in the dark. I quickly turned the light on (I've got a remote for it). Scared the living shit out of me it did, and I was too afraid to sleep with the lights off for about an hour, until I felt like I was too tired to be scared anymore lol, just gave up and slept. So yeah, that was weird, but shit happens I guess. What's with this constant dissociation though?",08Feb2020,1
181,"I want to tell my parents this some day... hopefully soon.

But when I was younger (not even 10 yet), I was sexually assaulted. I don’t remember how many people who held me down and touched me inappropriately. But they were all male and heterosexual. They were my relatives. This was their way of punishing me for suspecting me to be gay because I was more feminine, caring, and emotional than most boys in my family. There were also moments where I was forced to have sex. Then there was another moment where I had a gun point to my head, all for “fun” though.

I am turning 25 today and this trauma has finally unfolded itself. It hurts so bad. I don’t know what to do. I’m battling so many things. I can’t tell if I’m straight or gay. I know that shouldn’t matter, but I think about it. How messed am I? I know I’m not normal and struggle with infancy and anxiety. Constant waves of emptiness. I have too many deep and dark thoughts that I hate being alone. But I do not have the courage to ask people’s space and time.

I also think I have borderline personality disorder.

182,"Trigger warning - suicide

Hey reddit... this is my first time posting on here, because honestly and truly, I don’t know what to do. I feel like I need to vent, so I apologise in advance for the graphic post.

Just a bit of background, I’ve been surrounded by mental health issues for a number of years, and it’s never usually been an issue for me. I’ve always stepped up where I can to help and support those around me who need it. I’ve been involved (in some way) with 8 active suicide attempts in the last 3 years, whether that’s being first on scene, contacting the police and/or ambulance service remotely, or sitting with the person in hospital. I’m also a mental health first aider, and a medical first responder.

The last incident I dealt with has really messed me up... I got a message from a friend of my partner (at the time) to say that my partner had taken an overdose. The ambulance had already been called, so I rushed over to her flat. I arrived before the ambulance service, so I took my response bags out of my boot. I couldn’t get a response from her buzzer, or by knocking directly on the door once I got into the building. In the end, her housing officers broke down the door so we could gain access, and I was able to provide treatment to her until paramedics arrived. She was completely unresponsive when we got to her, and it was very touch and go for a few hours until she was stabilised in hospital, however she has since made a full recovery, and was discharged from hospital within a week. This included a couple of days in the psychiatric unit for assessment.

We have since broken up (3 weeks after this) and are no longer speaking, (I won’t go into detail, but it was a reasonably amicable breakup). However, now that the pain of the breakup has subsided, I’m now realising the magnitude of what happened, and it’s hitting me like a freight train. Each time I close my eyes, I can see her unconscious body, and I can feel the fear of not knowing if she was alive or not.

I’ve also got a ton of what-ifs going round in my mind - what if I’d have missed the message? What if the housing officers weren’t in that day? What if we’d had to wait for the police and ambulance to arrive before breaking into the flat? (It was initially categorised as a low priority call, as she was conscious and talking to her friend when the call was made, but when we arrived I asked the housing officer to call 999 again to upgrade the response). And I keep thinking if only I’d have seen the signs sooner, I could’ve stopped it altogether. And I just don’t know what to do to make it stop:..",08Feb2020,1
183,"I want someone to look at me and think “I wish I could do that.” “I wish I had that” “I wish I was her”

185,"Hi all. First let me say that I don't have all the symptoms of high functioning autism. But after learning about it, I do seem to have some of them. The extreme interest and becoming an expert in a topic rapidly is on of them. Another is some kind of sensitivity to light that I do not see others display. Others seem to largely ignore bright lights, and I'll often want sunglasses on even in a bright store at night. I actually like to wear them then, and sometimes get made fun of by friends but I don't really care. 

I also have some kind of social anxiety that I finally just had to overcome and just write off, in order to feel like I can interact with others without it being weird and awkward. But it took great effort on my part and many long years to come to this, and I still suffer from it here and there. Just not nearly as much as I used to. I also hate crowds, so much so that I won't be a part of any crowd. I just won't. I am not participating in that. Next I hate loud annoying noises and they bother the hell out of me. Like a lawnmower being ran by the neighbor. Other people just seem to be able to tune it out, and I hate it. It just keeps bothering me and bothering me. I just keep waiting and waiting for whatever the noise is to stop. 

I dislike interacting with people I don't know, and probably wouldn't if I didn't have to. I know it's for the best that I do though, so I just do it anyway in an effort to help myself get better at it. I put on a smile and act normal but I'd really prefer to never have to do it. I also really like routines, and get annoyed when they're broken. But that's something else I've learned that I just have to suck it up and deal with it. And I just try to form a new routine somehow.

Recently I've joined a school show where I play bass guitar with several other bassists who are much more skilled and confident than me. Most notably, one of my friends is a bassist who has started playing much more recently than me, but is already in league with the others. Subconsciously, I compare myself to them and feel like garbage because I'm not picking up the music as quickly or as well as them, especially since i feel like I have no excuse for it due to my friend breezing past this stuff. 

This has discouraged me from auditioning for songs and playing with any confidence at all, which caused me to be taken off many songs in the show. Not only that, but it makes me feel like I'm lazy and unmotivated since I'm not playing as well as i can.
