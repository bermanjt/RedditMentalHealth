2,"Or like telling me i don't have something and it's just a symptom of other mental illnesses i have or it's all in my head and I'm just over reacting. I have anxiety, depression, adhd and autism diagnosed already, meds for the first two, but all those were done when i was a kid or teen and had my parents describe whats happening along with myself. I've been reading lately about bipolarism after my fiance said something about it and i don't want to think i have it, but symptoms of it align with what i have experienced. Exteme mood changes, happy one second, furious the next, then depression etc. But i have no idea how to approach my doctors with my concerns without sounding like I'm paranoid or something.",13Jul2020,1
3,"For my social anxiety friends: Do you ever do something out of your comfort zone (yay me and yay you!) but then feel WORSE after doing that thing that gave you anxiety? If so, what have you done to make it “better”?",13Jul2020,1
4,"I often feel like its not me who controls my head, or at least that I am talking/fighting with something/someone else. Example: I can have a lot of motivation to do something, but that other thing tells me to just stay in my bed and do nothing. Or I sometimes text people weird stuff because the thing  takes control. It's really annoying, I often argue with my self and it. I don't know what it is, and I have never been tested or what ever you call it",13Jul2020,1
5,No matter what people say I'm always going to be nothing. I hat trying to live everyday wanting to kill yourself. Then you think it's looking up but no it gets thrown back at you like nothing. I hate it. I hate so much.,13Jul2020,1
6,"When i was little, i got a surgery at the left legs after i felled and brook it, to this days i remember the smells and the feeling of the products they used on me and..well surgery stuff i guess. So i made a dream of the doctors slicing my legs and looking into it, it kinda felt good to think of that.

Today, i wonder if i'd feel the same if i sliced my legs and how much blood could drop. I wonder how my skins could be so pretty bloody. I wonder if i could die from it. I want to make a lot of cut so my legs could be pretty by being decorate with red. 

Somehow, my stranged thoughts about self harm brought back to me memories of the hospital and now my legs feels more itchy. I wonder what the reaction of my friends would be, not that i care, as long as they don't give me problems i'm okkay with them knowing. But one of my best friends, who mutilate herself by the past, i wonder how sad and hopeless this could make her feels if she discovered it, i hope she won't. So i will just cut and cut and cut again until i pass from blood loss, tho i don't want my stuffs to be dirty from it. I want to make myself pretty while cutting and bleeding. I might even take photos ! I  bet i'll be super pretty even tho i'm a fattyyy !

&amp;#x200B;

..I wonder how i'll feel tomorrow, does this kind of behavior, changing toughts and mood everyday, have a name ? Could i pass a test or something ?",13Jul2020,1
9,"I cant get out of this rock bottom. Its been 2 years since I left high school but all I did was stay in my room and do nothing productive. Two important years I’ll never get back. The past 3 weeks made me literally suicidal, I asked for advice wherever I could. 

I watched motivational videos to get pumped up, I biked to get my blood flowing, I wrote down some advices I could use. So why? Why Im in the same place I was last month?

In the last couple of years Ive gone to therapy, I tried hobbies, I tried getting a job, I tried working out, I tried talking to people.  

My life flew by so fast since I got out of high school. Im still mentally a teen. 

I feel like I just hit rock bottom. I fucking need a miracle to get out of this. Nothing I do has any effect.",13Jul2020,1
10,"Some background: I'm a 19 year old who has been suffering with mental health issues off an on for at least 2-3 years (longer than that but they've probably only been serious for that time frame) and I've had a couple of appointments with my doctor about it in the past and took the option of therapy over pills. Almost a year later and now I'm finally giving in and planning on asking for antidepressants as I'm going through another bad episode of suicidal thoughts, bad anxiety, etc. I don't think it's at it's peak yet so I feel it'll be as bad of an episode as my worst ones where I think I experienced borderline panic/anxiety attacks. Anyways I'm ranting instead of getting to the point so

What are the negatives of antidepressants and how long will the negative side affects be a problem for, if they do end up occuring? For example, I saw weight gain and erectile dysfunction. Of course they're probably dependent on a case to case basis but would they last for as long as you take the drugs, for a sporadic period, or potentially longer/even after you've finished taking the pills? Also, how long should you take them for? Sorry for all the text and questions, I'm just desperate for answers at this point",13Jul2020,1
11,"Not sure what matters so here it goes, (also I'm a crappy writer, be gentle.)

41M, parent of 1 child.  I'm going through a divorce now.  The gist of the divorce is my wife picked her mom over me to the detriment of my mental health. (panic attacks, anxiety).   This all went down as COVID was starting and I was required to work from home.

I am a very extroverted person and I don't know how to get the emotional and interpersonal ""release"" i was getting from my wife and from co-workers/general interactions with the public.

I have a female best friend who unfortunately is getting the brunt of the built up emotional energy and extroverted energy and I think it's effected that friendship.

I don't know what I can do to help, Zoom meetings and stuff like that don't really replace interacting with people in person and the lack of any emotional output is making me fairly miserable.

I tried a few therapists but don't feel like it's helping at all.",13Jul2020,1
12,"i don’t know where to start. ever since I was forced to drop out of school things have been so bad. i feel like I’ve failed at everything in life. i keep making mistakes in my relationship and i don’t see what im doing wrong. im making it all about me and I don’t know how to stop it. i love this boy and i don’t want to purposely hurt him. im scared im gonna lose him. he lives so far away and he’s the most amazing thing that’s ever happened to me. but im treating him wrong and he tells me that I am. i overthink everything he says, I always think he’s mad. i always think im doing something wrong. i feel guilty for everything. im just hurting him, all the time from the sounds of it... my mom recently walked out. she was my best friend. we lived together, i told her everything and I did everything with her. she got raped and caught genital herpes. i was there for her. in the hospital, in the room when she got diagnosed. i let her cry on my chest. i was there for her. through everything, through the therapy and her trauma. i was there for everything. and now when I need her the most she’s not here... she still texts me sometimes, and comes to visit sometimes. but i feel like she left because of me. she tells me that’s not it but i think it is. i mean i dropped out of school and I’ve never had a job. i failed at everything an 18 year old should’ve accomplished by now. i have no friends. i don’t take my meds because they aren’t helping anymore. all i do is cry and i don’t eat meals. i just eat junk food. i constantly lose weight and gain it back. im never truly happy. im in a state of depression and I’m scared I won’t get out of it. i just need reassurance.",13Jul2020,1
14,"While the show is supposed to be light hearted and funny, there's a lot of meaningful discussion points in the show. I'll be talking about one that really helped me. I'll list other points at the bottom if you anyone reading this is struggling with any of them. 

One matter discussed on the show is PTSD, something I struggle with myself. Two characters in the show struggle with PTSD. One struggles with it as it manifests into a heavy weight he has to pull  along every day. The other repressed his emotions and when face with a feeling of losing his control, ended up facing mild mania. They both have a hard time addressing their problems. It makes me feel less alone knowing that I'm not crazy for having a hard time facing my problems and getting help. And more importantly, it reminds me that even if things are hard, life doesn't have to be dark and depressing and that I can still have fun. 

One of the characters with PTSD is a vet that served in Iraq. He struggles with survivor guilt, trying to learn how to have a healthy relationship while living with his illness, and the mistreatment of (specifically poc) veterans in the states. Another character is a Chinese girl that dropped out of medical school to help people using alternative healing methods. She struggles with identity issues. Another character was given a big opportunity to start a business and she struggled with losing meaningful friendships during that process. Later in the show, there is an older character that struggles with managing a love life while he knows he will be dying of cancer.

Other non mental health issues the show talks about is meeting hateful people with love, toxicity of elitist feminism (actually called misandry), the war on drugs, and sexual liberty.",13Jul2020,1
16,"I've played video games for as long as I can remember (Casual and highly competitive). Helped me fill the void of loneliness during high school while taking anti-depressants (Citalopram for 3-4 years now). Although I was socially inactive, it didn't interfere with my daily tasks of finishing school projects and working at Walmart as a cashier, which was very stimulating and gotten a lot of praise for my performance.

During the second semester in college however, the classes were becoming more and more complex, and I retreated into gaming (10-13 hours daily) instead of seeking tutors, thinking I was simply losing interest in the program.

When I returned from college I suffered a [gaming withdrawal](https://cgaa.info/gaming-withdrawal-symptoms/) just two days in my new job at another grocery shop, the symptoms lasted for 2 months, and were more intense during any physical activity. 2 weeks after I started working in a new job (Municipality maintenance) in late June I felt better, and returned to gaming with a tight schedule (2 hrs max), but relaxed during the weekend.

4th and 5th July I played for around 7-8 hours, since the weather was too hot for any activity. I felt tearful on Monday, then on Tuesday the depression skyrocketed, I was on the verge of a panic attack and literally started having suicidal thoughts. I had to take two days off due to how extreme the mental and emotional pain was, and I'm still recovering from it.

Is it time for me to hang up on games? Am I cursed from playing them?",13Jul2020,1
17,"Something I don’t want to go into detail about happened when I was a child, (around 6/7/8) and I even as a kid I knew it wasn’t right. But i never really thought about it as a teenager (through ages 12-17)

It’s only as an adult that the bad memory keeps coming back, and filling me with disgusting anxiety and guilt.

Why is this? I’ve been a lot more stressed from being 19 to now, and my mental health has gotten worse. Could that be linked to the sudden reappearance of this memory? 


Could anyone give tips on how to get rid of the feelings or deal with them?",13Jul2020,1

I’m really scared. 

Recently I been getting vivid dream like images while I’m trying to sleep. It’s just random images which almost feel like I am dreaming while still fully conscious and It happens when my eyes closed Then my intrusive voices/thoughts becomes a bit louder that’s why sometimes I get scared to go to slsspi.

But the real thing that is always in my head is that I can't and I will never talk to someone of them about my feelings and my problems I mean in my culture or country having mental problems means that you are crazy or something but no this is not what it's.

It's just someone who have suffered a lot in his life who want someone to talk to but this someone may have been not found yet 

I mean my family always look at me as if I'm still that kid who was irresponsible and stupid and only wants to play and have fun but noo I'm not that kid anymore I'm just a kind of an adult now but they just don't want to know that because they always want someone to blam him about something that happened but I can't anymore I'm trying to look okay but I'm not I'm a bad liar but they are still not seeing how I'm suffering maybe it's me maybe it's them I don't know maybe it's because I'm that guy who never till anyone his secrets but I mean come on man even my mom and dad can't see how much I'm sad and lonely at this time i don't know why I have been through a lot and I need someone to talk to please I really need someone a true listener because I have a big story that I hide and I need to tell my secrets to someone I need to let it out please help me",13Jul2020,1

23,"Are you tired of posting on this subreddit and getting no responses! Well lucky for you (sorry for the cliche i was trying to do an ""attention grabber"") 

I've been working on an app  during my quarantine (a mental health resource app).

I posted about it a bit a few weeks ago here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hj20dy/a\_mental\_health\_resource\_ive\_been\_working\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hj20dy/a_mental_health_resource_ive_been_working_on/) 

but sadly got no responses :( (ironic I know)

I wanted to give a more in depth look at how I want it to work.

There's 3 main tabs-

A home tab where there's a text box to ask a question about something you're struggling with

An explore tab where you can look through questions people are asking

A messages tab where you can see all your open chats

Essentially the point of the app is to have 1 on 1 anonymous conversations with people about something they've been struggling with. I decided to make it because I felt a lot of people post on here and never get answers because there are too many posts. Also I also have a lot of things on my mind that I don't feel comfortable posting on reddit and wanted somewhere I do feel comfortable posting

The main difference between this subreddit and the app I'm working on is that it will notify another user right after you ask a question - just like if you direct messaged them. It's also more like a therapy session with 1 on 1 conversation rather than a post with comments. 

I really just wanted to write this post to make people aware of this and to see what you guys think - especially if you think it would be helpful (I'll probably end up making it either way because I've put too much work in at this point). Also I would love suggestions on things you think would make it a better experience for you.",13Jul2020,1
24,"This is mostly just a vent post but I really want to hear other peoples inputs or if you've been in a similar situation. I honestly have no idea how bad I am or how much I actually need help but I began to feel anxious for virtually no reason and felt like getting it off my chest even in writing would make me feel a bit better.

So, I've been in a pretty bad spot now for a while and it got to a point where the other day I cracked, sitting at the top of my stairs crying my eyes out while trying to call my mother and father at 2am just so I can talk to someone; I ended up trying a crisis hotline too because I got so scared and NEEDED someone to talk to. Thankfully my parents got back to me fairly quickly before things got even worse.

I don't really want to go into specifics other than to mention that I'm only 24, still live with my father and graduated Uni recently with a first-class honors in a Networking degree but life just feels over for me already. I feel like an unemployable loser with no future, no hope and nothing really to live for.

I've struggled with what I think is depression ever since I was a child. I had suicidal thoughts while I was in primary school, at one point tried to break my own neck and I used to severely beat myself in random bursts of anger just so I didn't take it out on other people. These issues have quite literally never been addressed and I have just bottled everything up for the past 15-16 years but I'm beginning to crack.

To get to the point, I feel afraid. I feel scared to see a therapist even though I quite clearly have a lot of issues that I desperately need help with. I try to rationalize it with the fact that I don't believe I would ever try to kill myself out of both fear and understanding how it would affect those close tome even after I tried too once as a child and that it would be better to just keep bottling everything up.",13Jul2020,1
25,"I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression a few years ago and have been struggling with it since I was 13. My stepmom was in a really bad mood today and I asked her if she was mad at me, she said no and I said okay good, sorry but I get really anxious and worried and think when people are in bad moods it’s because of me. I told her my anxiety has been worse lately and she said;

“You do not have anxiety so just stop”
Me: I do though
Her: have you been diagnosed?
Me: yes years ago both anxiety and depression 
Her: that was years ago. You don’t have it anymore you probably just got over it. 

The conversation ended after that. I’ve been struggling a lot lately because my ex of 2.5 years who I though was going to be married to soon dumped me and his reasoning was that I was too fat for him and he didn’t want me anymore. I feel like I can’t reach out to anyone and I’m just stuck in my bubble of sadness all day.",13Jul2020,1

32,Have been struggling with mental illness and addiction since pre teen years. I just recently got out of rehab in December and unfortunately have relapsed since. I’ve totally disappointed every single person around me once again. Fell into a relationship with a drug dealer who ended up lying to me for 6 months. Decided to drink a 26 4 days ago with a whole bottle of trazodone and ended up in the hospital. In the morning when they woke me up to take my blood work and all sorts of shit a few hours they came back and told me a pregnancy test came back positive. So after that I was transferred to another hospital where they kept me for 3 days and all I could do was stare at a wall for 72 hours. Now I’m home and have no fucking idea what to do.

👉 I don't listen enough &amp; interrupt many people numerous times through the conversation (both knowingly &amp; unknowingly) 

👉 I feel dumber &amp; more unaware of my environmental surroundings around 

👉 I always try to convince people 

👉I have noticed I have superiority complex vibe I give off and pisses off mostly everyone (all the men in my job while more women like it)

👉 I seem to feel apathy towards my family at times (I'm getting better at this currently, WORK IN PROGRESS)

34,"My dad literally just waltzed into our kitchen and said: “What they doing?”

Understandably, I was really confused, because that question doesn’t even make sense. After a few awkward seconds, I asked what he meant. He told me he was “...trying to be ‘politically correct’. Isn’t ‘you’ a pronoun snowflakes don’t like?”

I was absolutely shocked, because I knew he didn’t approve of the LGBTQ+ movement, but this was a new low (even for him). He then proceeded to completely shut me down when I tried to educate him on pronouns and the English language.

36,"In the first few months of my (19) relationship with my boyfriend (24) we had a problem. Whenever his girl friend was around he would move away from me and become very touchy with her. It shattered most of the trust I had in him and I felt abandoned. 

When I finally told him I wasn’t okay with it, he was hesitant to stop being touchy with her. I almost broke up with him but then he decided that he would stop. A reason as to why he hesitated could be because his ex was very controlling of him and would force him to act a certain way with girls. It was a toxic relationship that he had just ended.

While he did stop being touchy with her I knew that they were still close and it became several months of us having fights about it and me just feeling like an anxious wreck the whole time.

Now, he started going to therapy and became way more understanding of my feelings and what I went through. He would reassure me and even decided that he would avoid talking or seeing her at all costs because he doesn’t want me to feel hurt. They’re co-workers so they have to discuss work things sometimes.

I don’t understand why but I still have baggage about this. I don’t obsess over it as much as I used to but every few weeks or so I’d be hit with a thought concerning her and I can’t stop thinking about it. One thought recently was, “What if she greets him on his birthday?” It’s stupid but thoughts like this make me so restless and whenever this happens I bring it up with him. I don’t want to anymore because he’s dealing with his own emotional problems.

Worst part is, it feels like no one gives a shit. I have to continuously describe in great detail how bad im suffering for my health care providers to even look me in the eye with a shred of compassion.

39,"my dad (57) died in my (19) dorm room in march, from unknown causes. he just suddenly collapsed and was dead in minutes. without going into detail what i saw that day was just extremely traumatic for me. 

in the last couple months i’d been doing okay except for periodic fits of depression and mania. but the stress of everything is just tearing me up now. i haven’t been this depressed since i was in middle school. i’m tired all the time. i can’t bring myself to do much. money is tight now that our income has been cut in half, and i’m supposed to be applying to at least 50 schools to try to bargain with my college to give me more money in financial aid, but it’s just too much for me to go through and share my sob story and fill out applications. i’m so overwhelmed, there are so many things i need to do to be responsible that i never had to do when my dad was alive. 

i’ve been feeling suicidal and i want to self harm again.  i haven’t done it in years but you never really lose the urge, you know. i won’t kill myself because i couldn’t hurt my mom like that but i’m really just falling apart. i want to just float away. i’ve lost interest in a lot of things i used to like. i’ve lost touch with my religion. i know how to tell when i need help by now but i can’t stand it.

40,"This is going to be a long story..I apologize in advance. I’m not sure exactly where to begin, so I’ll just start by saying that the memories I do have, aren’t good ones. I remember when I was in the 5th grade my best friend died in a house fire. I was told that I started burning myself with lighters, matches, candles, anything that had a flame because I wanted to feel what she felt. I don’t remember this detail, I just know that everyone in the family that lived in the house all have the same story on it. I have memories of being bullied, but they aren’t the same instances. It’s all mixed memories, different times and at different stages throughout middle and high school. I have few memories of family gatherings, and almost none of my mother and father. My mother tells me that my father had a raging drug/alcohol addiction. When my father came back into my life he told me that my mother is crazy. That she has some type of mental illness (he didn’t know exactly what so he just said that). He told me that she coached my sister on how to report my sisters father for rape when she was just seven. She had her sit in the floor with a babydoll and pointed out places to say he touched her, and how to have a reaction to certain things. My aunt has told me that my mom claimed to work 2-3 jobs throughout my entire childhood, but never had the money to properly care for my sister and I. She said she has cake over to the house being completely covered in trash and to my sisters bed and my own bed being covered in our own feces and urine, and us being covered in dirt with mattered hair. My sister defends my mother sometimes, but other times she tells me stories that would put my mother as abandoning us. The only story I remember clearly was when she was changing in front of me and I noticed a scare on her chest in between her breasts. I asked her about it and she said she dropped a pot of boiling water on herself. Confused as to how a grown woman had done that, I pressed her a little on the story. She said it was when she was around 5 or 6 and she was making us (herself and me) some spaghetti. The pot was too heavy and she ended up spilling it all on herself. I asked her why she was cooking and she said mom was in bed, too tired from working two jobs. The way my mother is now and the way she acts towards me, has made me start questioning why I have almost no memories with her, especially in my really young ages. Now a days, she’s very manipulative and guilt tripping. She borrows money from everyone, and never pays them back. She has taken loans out in my name when I was 16 (not sure how she got away with it) and when I went to buy my own car at 21 and was declined being told my credit was too bad, I looked into it. I asked her about it and she claimed it wasn’t her, so when I said that’d I ask the company to pull the video if they still have it she started screaming that I wanted her out into jail. Now my credit is decent, but any time I’m getting ahead she always pops up and tells me something has happened and she needs money to help. First it was her car broke down, then it was she got laid off of work, then it was her car again, and now it’s that the company she works for didn’t deposit her latest check and she’s waiting on it. Anytime I call her out on it or tell her that I can’t afford to give her more money, she starts saying things like “that’s okay. I’m going to go to sleep now, hopefully I won’t wake back up.”, “well maybe I can live in my car for a bit. Or find a bridge to live under.”, “it’s not like I didn’t bust my ass to raise you and your sister but it’s okay, you take care of you.” And other things. She even mocks my mental health issues in ways. For instance, when I was living with her she would never clean and trash would pile up on top of itself. When I would try to clean up after her, I’d go into full blown panic attacks because I’m highly OCD. She’d then start crying, claiming she’s a bad mother for letting her area get this bad. When I tell her I’ve been depressed and can’t come see her, she tries to make it sound like her depression is worse than mine. When we go out in public and it gets too crowded, resulting in me having a panic attack, she’ll start to have one and it’ll be worse than mine forcing me to basically force myself under control and take care of her. At first I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, but now it’s starting to seem too coincidental to me. And I can’t defend myself because I have no memories to fall back on. I’ve been considering trying hypnosis or some sort of repressed memory therapy, however I have no idea where to begin on this or if I’m even in the right to do so. 

Is it wrong of me to accuse my mother of this? Should I seek out repressed memory therapy?",13Jul2020,1
41,"I'll be a freshman in college next year and have never had a girlfriend. I've always felt a little lonely, but these past few weeks have been hell. I'm not bad looking either, in the past i've just found that I often lack a lot of confidence when it comes to talking to girls and I feel like I come off as awkward. Of course, high school is a bitch, and once you are known as a certain type of person, you can't change, and I guess that just kind of followed me through out high school. I met a girl I really liked at my friend's house, she seemed really into me, and even her friends said so that night. We ended up texting a little and about a week later I asked her if she would want to hang out sometime, to which she said sure, but also said that she has work during the week and sports other days so she can't. I took that as a way to tell me ""no"" in the nicest way. I felt like she was the last chance I had to date someone before college, and now it feels like I won't find anyone before then. It may sound dramatic, but I just feel off or like I'm missing out on never even coming close to a high school relationship. Ever since then, we still talk a little, and I'm mostly fine throughout the day, but when night comes around, and I'm all alone in the room with nothing to keep my mind off things, an intense feeling of just sadness and loneliness hits me hard, and honestly will go on for around three hours before I finally decide to go to sleep, still sad. I feel like i'm a complete loser who just missed so many opportunities because I was an idiot. This ""nightly routine"" has been going on for around a whole week now, and the only things I do to just stop thinking about the loneliness for a bit is just drive around my town for a couple hours or just sit in the shower. How can I just get over this? It felt like the one time I literally had a relationship guaranteed to me, with her being into me, and all her friends saying the same thing, just got ripped right from me. I don't understand it at all.",13Jul2020,1
43,"my dad was and still is an alcoholic and a was very abusive and dangerous growing up always beating my mom up and hitting everyone.

Recently I found out a while ago my father sexually assaulted family and I’m unsure if he’s done it to me too, I feel like I have suppressed memories hidden and I hardly remember my childhood anymore, I had some sort of dream or possible memory from a kid of my dad doing something to me but I don’t know if it’s made up from me or it’s real or a dream.. but I know that’s not normal for a child to dream or make up something like that?

Since I’ve found out about the whole situation I physically feel disgusted I feel disgusted in my own body and as a human knowing I came from that bastard! 
It’s getting so bad I’m wanting to just kill myself so fucking badly, or I’m contemplating wether to murder him.
I feel very disgusted and disturbed, and I’ve always been afraid growing up ending up like my father
And since I found out that about him I’ve been having very disturbing and unwanted intrusive thoughts and they won’t go or leave me alone sometimes
I’ve started to fear that I’ll end up just like him!
Ive become afraid to socialise with some people and children, how can I look a child in the eye knowing I was made from a rapist/pedophile.
I’ve become afraid of having children in the future or even starting a family.

I’m afraid I’ll end up like my “dad” because I carry his genes, what if I turn up like him, I’m having intrusive thoughts too so bad I want to just shove a screwdriver or anything right through my brain to just make everything stop!

I’m really scared I can’t really go on anymore 
I’ve had past mental health issues like depression, anxiety, paranoia from drugs, I used to be on medication but it made me feel worse so I’m not on it anymore and I can’t tell or speak to family about it because everyone had enough going on.

I physically feel disgusted with myself I hate the skin covering my body I hate every inch of myself knowing I come from pure evil!!!
Sometimes I feel emotionless too recently I’m always alone in my room overthinking everything and trapped in my thoughts, sometimes when I’m serious I feel like I’m faking my emotions and deep down I feel like I’m laughing when I’m not, I hardly cry anymore even though I just want to so bad I’ve cried like once in the past year, which was two weeks ago.
I’ve tried forgetting and moving on but it keeps coming back to the family what he did, he’s haunting everyone! 
He’s mentally fucked my brain and I don’t know if I’m normal,.

44,I was diagnosed with PTSD and OCD a few years ago and I have symptoms that aren't that severe. But I'm having new symptoms that are foreign to me. Two days ago I woke up out of a sleep with a thought in my head and I can't get that though to go away. Literally when I say all day that's what I mean. Has anyone experience this before?

46,"I’m not diagnosed with depression or anxiety, although I’d venture to say that I have both. Recently, maybe in the last year or so, I’ve gotten to the point where I will randomly start exclaiming “f*ck me” or “sh*t sh*t sh*t” or even “I wanna die.” And then once I say it I kind of rapidly repeat it to myself out loud until I regain some self control and stop and force my mind to think about something else. And the thing about the last phrase is I don’t want that, I dont even consider myself suicidal. It’s just in the specific moment when I’m internally freaking out and I get so stressed that I say those things. And this ALWAYS happens because I’m overthinking about a moment in which I feel like I did something embarrassing. For example, it happened just before me typing this up and the embarrassing moment I was thinking about happened years ago. This can be even more frustrating because sometimes I’ll accidentally start repeating a cuss word seemingly out of nowhere but within earshot of a friend or family member. Anyways, I know a lot of my friends are diagnosed with mental illnesses and we have pretty frank discussions about them, but I’ve never heard of anyone that does this. And I just wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this or if this is a common symptom of anxiety or if it’s just some weird quirk/coping mechanism I’ve developed? Overall it’s not a big deal and I manage, but I just wanted to see if anyone out there kind of knew what I was talking about.",13Jul2020,1

it's usually only for a day but occasionally I will feel physically disgusted by someone for a week +, and again, it's nothing that they've done.. it just happens.

50,"i think Meditation &amp; Exercise will heal mental illness, at least partially

when i say meditation i mean the act of trying to do nothing. no movements, no thoughts. the reasoning comes from many places, like tibetan buddhism. specifically the practice of creating and destroying sand mandalas 

(destroying is not a good word for this but it’s the best i can think of. youtube tibetan sand mandalas and you will see what i mean. i see it as two parts, exercise(creating) and meditation(destruction) honestly nirvana is the better word, instead of destruction.)

the second part, exercise, is physical like running or mental like a puzzle.

The worst part is that I don’t even know why she went into my phone, she never explained it. I asked her a couple days ago if I’d ever be able to see him again, after all it’s been 6 months. And she responded back with “he was never your friend.” My god do I hate my mom, when I tell her about how I’m depressed it’s just “FaKe It TiLl YoU mAkE iT.” But I’ve gotten so miserable that I can’t even pretend to be happy.

58,"
I went from my being one of the top students in high school, and then in my department in college during my first year, winning prizes and even being encouraged by my professors to publish, during my year, to one of the most disappointing, lowest achieving, most worrisome and inconsistent student probably on the whole campus. 

I don’t even know what year I am in anymore. I’ve lost count. I think I’ve been at college for a total of three and half semesters, but I’ve taken so many incompletes, withdrawals and even Fs that I’m afraid to look at my transcript anymore unless I absolutely need to. I’m too ashamed, it hurts to look at. 

I took my first leave of absence after just one semester at college. I started out so strong right away and absolutely adored my classes and my professors, and wrote two of the best essays I’ve ever written to date, but by the end of that first semester things had begun rapidly going downhill. I’m still not sure what happened, if it was laziness, ADHD, ADHD medication, poor study habits or a more serious mental illness but I was barely function by the end of that semester. I had literally no friends, but I didn’t mind. I had become obsessed with my English and philosophy classes, and was starting to see all of these amazing connections between everything I was studying, but totally neglected my French class which I ended up failing. I was staying up all night pacing around the campus, developing all of these theories, checking out thirty books from the library at a time, not really eating much or socializing ever, hooked on cigarettes and obsessed with one of my profs. I was making so many bad decisions but I was also really having a good time in my own little world in my head. But I was barely able to write a coherent sentence. My papers were starting to become more and more rambling and I wasn’t finishing them on time, sometimes at all. I eventually, slowly, developed a strange and elaborate paranoid delusion about my favorite professors and became very depressed about it, so much so that I felt unable to stay at school, even though being at home was the last place I thought I’d ever want to be. I decided to take a leave of absence. I didn’t tell anyone about the delusion because I was afraid of what would happen if I did, and at that point I had no idea it was a delusion. During my leave of absence I went to intensive outpatient therapy and was diagnosed with social anxiety and bipolar disorder and prescribed abilify and Wellbutrin, which my mom didn’t want me to take so I never took. Later they would take back the bipolar diagnosis. And then give it back to me and then take it back again. 

My delusion eventually went away after a long time and after telling therapist about it finally and being shocked into reality. I went back to college in the fall, and did okay. I stayed for spring. Did okay but struggled, barely keeping my head above water. 

My mental health declined gradually the next couple of semesters, and I was never as motivated or brilliant as I was that first semester. I wasn’t doing any of my work or getting out of bed. I was obsessed with life memories of my father French kissing me as a child and could not stop thinking about it. I got a little paranoid and even called the police because I thought my roommate was being sexually assaulted but apparently she was listening to music. I started to believe I was suffering from all sorts of terrible diseases. Eventually I became so stressed and depressed and confused that I was hospitalized in a psych ward for nine days. There was given abilify and had such a bad reaction to it I nearly died. But I didn’t seem as unhealthy as the other people there and to this day I don’t think I deserve to get any slack because I feel like my problems are mostly my fault. 

I’m on my second medical leave now and I’m living with my mom, working at a restaurant. I just share my money with my mom who doesn’t work. We don’t have a house of our own and just bounce between a bunch of places. It can be stressful at times. I’m worried I’ll never be able to succeed. It’s been four years and nothing has changed or been clarified or resolved. It just keeps getting worse and I lose motivation every day. My future looks nonexistent.

I just took a class online which I barely passed but I did. I feel like such an enormous failure. I am still living with my mom at 23. I can’t even drive. I am hooking up with this guy who won’t actually be my boyfriend and even though it makes me feel bad Im afraid to end things or ask for more emotional support. I think he came inside me, and didn’t tell me, and got me pregnant. I had to have a medical abortion a couple weeks ago and didn’t tell anyone. My mom would have murdered me. I don’t know how he would react. I feel so guilty about all of this. I’m such a fuck up. 

I still don’t really have a diagnosis except depression and anxiety. I’m on depression meds and they help. A lot of psychs that I’ve been to try to prescribe me antipsychotics but I’m really afraid of them and my mom is skeptical of mental health field in general. She doesn’t like any of the therapists I’ve been to. I’m afraid of bringing it up to her because she gets upset when I do it seems. Right now I’m not seeing anyone, and just being prescribed antidepressants and add meds by my regular doctor, my mom tells me not to tell them everything because they’ll make me see a psychiatrist who we can’t afford and who will make me take meds that are dangerous. And im scared to be honest since I had such a scary reaction to antipsychotic medication last time and my blood pressure dropped so low. But I need the approval of a psych to go back to school. Right now it feels like I will never be ready to go back. And my mom needs my help here as well. And I’ve already wasted so much of my family and my university’s money. And the states money (during my hospital stay). 

I am likely going to need 2 more full years to graduate. Right now I am on my SECOND leave of absence. I’m amazed they haven’t just kicked me out yet. My dean says my professors say I’m brilliant and they believe in me but I think she’s just saying that to be nice. It’s a very expensive liberal arts college am on a ton of financial aid so I’m taking up the college’s resources. Everyone believes in me and has invested so much into me and I disappoint them time after time after time. I’m so ashamed and afraid. I can’t even walk down the halls of my university without feeling shame. All the profs know a little about my situation and have been so supportive and helpful and given me breaks and I have let them down time after time. 

Truth is I love college and want to go back so badly but I don’t think at this point I deserve another chance.",13Jul2020,1

I don’t think I can deal with this by myself anymore so I need advice for reference I am non binary and 20 years old my boyfriend is 21 he’s American and Im Canadian 

I went to live with my boyfriend in Texas in November 2019 with plans to come home in April 2020  

He told me his family was going to be great and that we would all get along but it didn’t take very long for his family’s true colours to show. The day before his birthday I took him out to buy presents because his family never ever does anything for his birthday they do a lot of things for his brothers birthday though and I felt awful about that so I wanted to make this one special. 

Once we got home his mother wanted to know everything that I bought him she had been accusing me of making him do drugs and of getting him a passport so he would be able to leave with me I got mad and dropped the bag of gifts on the counter immediately his entire family came at me his mother was going to beat me up his brother started screaming at us they made him go to our bedroom so they would be able to yell at me alone 

His brother screamed at me and called me a bitch and threatened to get me deported his mother told me Im disrespectful and Im not allowed to act like that in her house once things calm down a bit I told them that if I did get my boyfriend a passport it was his choice to go somewhere else not mine and not theirs his mother played the victim and said she would’ve beaten me up if nobody stopped her then they sent me back and brought out my boyfriend to talk to him it was absolutely awful for the next two weeks I was sick because of the stress 

Other things would happen like his mother screaming at him for buying me food that Im not allergic to because I have food allergies his brother having tantrums screaming hitting the walls yelling at us all that stuff his mother also told me that if I got pregnant she would kill me but I wasn’t allowed to get an abortion because she is Catholic even though I and my family are pagan and so is my boyfriend she said that if I got pregnant then she would take the baby from me and I wouldn’t be allowed to have it and I wouldn’t be allowed to talk to my boyfriend anymore.  we don’t want children at all 

I did end up having a miscarriage and I attribute it to the stress I wasn’t able to get any help for it because I wasn’t able to tell his family that I was ever pregnant at all 

My boyfriends mothers house is the most disgusting place I have ever lived it was full of roaches and living in Newfoundland Canada I had never even seen a roach before I got to Texas there was also mice and a giant hole in his bedroom floor his bedroom was not big enough for both of us and we were sleeping in a twin bed the whole time but we weren’t really able to go into any other room of the house because it was so small and we didn’t want to interact with his other family members  

His mother would never take us to go get groceries and we were too far away from the city to walk and get our own groceries but she would also scream at us if we got takeout food too much and she would say that I didn’t spend my money on anything else but we never had the chance to do anything besides eat and play video games in a cramped bedroom 

His mother would make us do her dishes clean her kitchen basically do all of her housework and our own and I was expected to do most of it because I am the “woman” 

If we didn’t do her housework and our own we would be called lazy and my boyfriend would not receive the money that he gets for being her provider so we would have even less money to buy food 

Once Covid got to the states we went to get my boyfriend a passport I was going to pay for it but for some reason my card didn’t work at some the places we went to some places would reject it because it was Canadian even if I had money in it and I didn’t expect that to happen so he had to pay for it but he had the money because of tax returns we even paid it to get it expedited because I didn’t want to go back to Canada without him knowing that I would be doing very very badly now that I knew how badly he was treated every day and how I wouldn’t be able to keep him safe in a different country 

We didn’t get the passport before the border closed so I chose to stay in Texas longer 

Probably close to a month later his mother found out because of a banking error that he got a passport and I got sick because her house was so dirty and ended up in the hospital once I got out of the hospital I went to a motel because I knew that I would only get sicker if I stayed around his mother and while him and I were living in the motel she would call every day sometimes more than once just to keep harassing us she stole his passport from him by threatening to lock him up in his grandparents house if he didn’t give it to her 

I already had pre existing trauma and mental health issues before moving to Texas the things that I experienced with my boyfriends mother made me feel worse gave me more trauma and just deteriorated my mental health and physical health  

I was so mad that my boyfriend wouldn’t call the police or do something to get his passport back and we would fight a lot because of it he has gone to the legal advice sub Reddit a bunch of times to try to get help with that but we just have to get him a new one but this time Im gonna pay for it by sending him money for it 

His mother is abusive and evil I’ve never met someone that I genuinely thought was evil that I genuinely believed had no good or kindness in them at all before I met his mother for all of his life she’s treated him like she didn’t want him but she won’t let him leave and it scares me so badly because I have prior trauma of my best friend killing themself in a similar situation 

I had to come back to Canada without him because I was dying I was so sick and so weak I was hardly able to walk around the motel room and if I stayed I would have died 

My boyfriend and I have been fighting a lot because Im so scared of what his mom may do to him and Im so scared I won’t get to see him anymore Im so angry that he didn’t get the passport back Im so angry that he didn’t get a new one before the second wave of Covid hit in the states 

Im basically just looking for advice on how to keep myself sane I’ve been worrying myself sick and Im in such a bad way that I keep getting sicker from the stress and then I think about how me acting like this makes my boyfriend feel and it hurts even more 

My heart physically hurts from everything I am so worried constantly Im so worried that his mom is going to hurt him Im so worried she’s going to find the second passport and take it I just want him to be with me and to be happy he’s suffering and Im suffering and the border is closed and I’ve been trying to find a way to get him an exemption but what does it matter if he doesn’t have a passport 

I live in constant fear because Im not with him I have very very bad separation anxiety and trauma from things like this in the past and everything feels so impossible because not only is his family trying their hardest to keep him away from me but the border between us is closed and I have no way to get to him and he has no way to get to me before the border opens or I get him an exemption 

I have no idea how to deal with this it hurts a lot and I don’t think I have the words to describe how awful that makes me feel I apologize if this post is a bit all over the place I didn’t want to put much effort into proofreading it because writing it brought back enough bad thoughts 

If anyone has any advice on how to deal with this mixture of separation anxiety and trauma please let me know I’ve been doing awful for more than a month now and it’s taking a lot out of me I know it’s hard on my boyfriend too",13Jul2020,1

70,"I already wrote about my problems here a while ago but i reread earlier today and realized it didn’t truly explain it and I was rushing and didn’t know how to word it. I spent sometime thinking about and decided to rewrite it to say how I’m am mentally. It also adds a lot of details and is very long.

I see things, it’s usually monsters from my imagination, they would surround my bed and stare at me. I can feel their eyes and feel that thing under my bed and see the claws popping out of my closet. It always scare me and I tired to touch them a few times to be brave but it feels so real and I imagine them trapping my wrists and ankles and hold me down.
My imaginary friend is very friendly she understands me completely and I don’t have to say anything and she’s by my side but 2 weeks ago me and her were arguing for 10 minutes before I realized she’s wasn’t real...

I always saw things when I was younger there was always a presence in my room at night and sometimes when I enter a room I would see family or friends for a glance and not see them. I am now afraid of being watched most times it felt like a millions eyes from every where is watching me or behind me looking over my shoulder. 

I am every where with emotions. I can’t control them at all, when I get angry I can barely control it and most of the time I don’t want to be angry but it’s like someone in my head is controlling all of my emotions, most of the time I don’t feel like I’m in control. I feel like I am nothing but an empty shell of other things in my head to control. 
Sometimes I would feel nothing, like a sociopath no empathy no anger just calm. I would also have sick and dark fantasy of hurting and torturing others and truly thing about it. It’s a craving and I had others like a craving to eat my raw flesh or put my arm in a blender and I nearly done it. I’m afraid I would hurt myself and others.

I would also have depressed days where my mind is begging me to end my life and fills my body up with a million reasons to commit suicide. I sometimes would feel “normal” for minutes to hours and convinced myself there is nothing wrong with me and it’s so confusing and makes me feel insane. Sometimes I lost my voice and can’t speak for no reason it’s like I forgotten to speak.

Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me, I would jump in my bed and smack my head because my mind convinced me there was no ceiling there. Or if I step outside of the room I would fall to a void and die. Lately my mind been trying to convince me everything is a simulation and fake, I haven’t fallen for it...yet. I also slowly losing my memories I always been bad at remembering but everyday i think about yesterday or a few hours ago and they feel like it happens a year ago or someone erased most of it beside the key points. And lately the things I been seeing started happening at school like a wall would be made of human flesh and hold a giant eye and now my reflection is changing and is acting on its own 

I don’t know what to do.. or how to approach this subject with my parents for help I’ve only told my friend and she doesn’t know the full extant(I had a normal middle class life, no abuse or trauma and I don’t know anything about my family’s medical history)",13Jul2020,1

Once I come to my senses, I realize that I’m in a ditch, and my 600 pound four wheeler is about to crash on top of me and possibly kill me, so I back away and I survive. I call my mom and tell her bout what happened, then my stepdad comes and helps me and the four wheeler up. We drive back home and I take a shower. 10 minutes into the shower I just start thanking god for this fucking miracle that just happened, i crashed into a ditch, almost die, and make it out fine. Ever since then I’ve been thinking about how everything could’ve went horribly wrong. I could’ve died, leaving my parents and friends in a depressive state, I could’ve been crippled and never walk for the rest of my life, and my life hasn’t even started(I’m 13), and the list goes on.

76,"I wasn't sure where to post this, A few/couple months ago my doctor put me on Fluoxetine at my personal request, I had gone on it last year but stopped early because I found a source of LSD (yeah the hallucinogenic drug) and was really interested in it, but I knew that SSRIs and psychedelics don't mix well. Well long story short, I had a fun wee phase of infrequent LSD use, during this period my mental health was the best it has been in a long time. The source of LSD, however, went cold at the start of 2020, plus starting an Engineering degree doesn't leave much time to mess around. 

A few months ago I was getting worse but didn't think much of it and got my doctor to put me on Fluoxetine and this time I intended to let it work out, about 4-5 weeks after starting it I realise that my anxiety attacks were stopping, I thought less about feeling shit, and I was happier, great I thought, it's starting to work, then it went further and I was on a solid high for about 3 weeks, confident, satisfied, optimistic, ended a little more than a week ago and have been ""coming down"" from it since, but still relative to how I originally was, I'm still in a good place. 

I was due for my check-in last Thursday, and with respiratory symptoms (of cold, I live in COVID free New Zealand) so I rang and did a phone consult with my dr, said how I've been feeling better, complained kinda about some side effects like how it destroys my Libido but yknow, I also told her I downplayed how bad I was originally, and I said that I really wanted to get a referral to psychiatry to be screened for any underlying mental illness and to also be definitively told what I do and don't have wrong with me. 

Some context is that my entire life I have been different, at times I was a difficult child and according to my Mum when I was young playing  I would walk around in circles flinging my hands around in very programmed ways while making noises and because of this she took me to a diagnostic centre because she thought I was autistic, turns out I wasn't autistic but they still said that I was 'gifted', 'borderline on the spectrum' and potentially had mild dyslexia. 

Anyway, the Dr agreed that it was a good idea and set up another appointment which is tomorrow as of writing this to organise a referral to private psychiatry. However that afternoon after my phone consult, I was rung again by the Dr, told that she talked to the public psychiatrist at the health centre about my case and she told me to stop taking the Fluoxetine straight away because she was writing me a new script for Quetiapine ( Seroquel in the US ) to take each night to keep me stable until I can see the public psychiatrist who personally accepted my referral for the 3rd August for a full 90-minute assessment. So at least out of this I do get a free psychiatrist session in only a few weeks.

But anyway, now I've stopped the Fluoxetine, started this Quetiapine, and I am seriously doubting that it was a good idea, the Quetiapine knocks me out asleep in 20 minutes after I take it ( a good thing considering I have terrible sleep onset insomnia ) but now during the days I just do not feel right, I keep getting bouts of confusion, keep forgetting things, motivation and concentration is down. 

When the psychiatry clinic nurse rang me to tell me they accepted me, she told me they are especially looking at bipolar disorders for diagnosis but they will cover everything I might have. I don't believe I have bipolar disorder though, I've been suspecting that maybe I have had like ADHD which went undiagnosed through childhood and is now manifesting into a lot of my issues now. But this sudden change from a pretty benign Antidepressant to a side effect ridden antipsychotic seems like a big mistake, especially because the new semester of Uni is starting and I don't want to mess with my brain chemistry at the moment. 

I don't really know why I'm even posting this massive wall of text here but I'm just hoping that some people can relate and share their stories with not feeling right, diagnosis, medication/side effects etc. 

And has anyone else ever been put on Quetiapine and felt a little crazy from it?

TLDR: Was depressed and having pretty debilitating anxiety attacks, went on Prozac, felt better, then had a \*hypo\*manic episode, Dr put me on antipsychotic Seroquel, took me off Prozac, and now I'm scheduled for a psychiatric evaluation, where the psychiatrist suspects Bipolar and I suspect something more along the lines of ADHD or autism lol.",13Jul2020,1
77,"I've been struggling with social anxiety for years, and I always felt anxious going to classes, meeting with friends, or going shopping. But I always managed to do it, and I was improving a lot.

But because of quarantine, I've been stuck inside for months now and have barely been outside. Now all the progress I have made over the last YEARS is lost. I'm scared to go outside of the house, meet anyone (even my closest friends), and I can barely make it through grocery shopping without wanting to throw up or pass out.

It's even gotten to the point where I'm scared of online classes or texting friends. I'm terrified to turn on the camera or microphone when I'm in class. I haven't spoken to most of my friends since a few weeks into quarantine, and I'm too scared to talk to anyone now.

All of this has taken a huge toll on my mental health and just makes me want to give up. It took years to get to the place where I was, and I don't think I can do it again. Why should I even bother trying again, if I could loose my progress in just a few weeks?",13Jul2020,1
78,"So I started thinking about this more often recently. A while back, I talked to someone who had DID. They talked about systems, alters, how their different personalities are, etc. I thought it was very interesting and thought I would be equally as open about my schizophrenia, and they mentioned it sounded similar to DID. Now, I know the two are similar and are often confused due to that, but ever since that comment, I've noticed how much similar my symptoms are to DID and not schizophrenia. 1) I have only auditory hallucinations of one voice which is common in DID based on what I've read. I used to have tactile hallucinations of someone like tapping on my shoulder or brushing their hand on my arm, but I haven't had them in a while. I just thought when I hear about schizophrenic hallucinations, it's visual and auditory and tactile, not just auditory of one voice much less. 2) I'm fairly young for being diagnosed with schizophrenia. I started showing symptoms (according to my family) around the age of 6 and was diagnosed when I wad 11-12. This is very young for schizophrenia, and I never really questioned it since I trusted doctors, but I realised truly how young it is. I don't know if this is an actual connection, but I know DID is caused by trauma at a young age (which would make sense for me I think because of my living situations and my sister being abusive mentally and physically ever since we were young; she still does it to this day. My mom is fairly mentally abusive as well and hasn't done much to deal with my sister). I'm not sure if DID would actually show up this early, but it I thought it would explain why I had symptoms much younger than what's common with schizophrenics if symptoms do appear at this young of age when you develop DID. 3) I rarely have delusions. I think one thing that's overall most common in schizophrenics is delusions, and I barely have them. I've had episodes where I do, but it's so rare that I couldn't even name you the last time I had one. 4) I space out and have lengths of time where I completely forget what happens. I read some things online for DID, and commonly, people with it would space out a lot and also forget certain things they should remember. For one example, with me I remember being in bed about to sleep. I was dozing off and kind of spaced out I guess you could say, and the next thing I know, I'm out of bed after having taken a shower. Another, I will change clothes without even remembering it. Or I'll eat a meal, forget I had done it until my mom asked why I was eating again (I have really strong muscle reflex issues, so I'll get sick if I eat slightly too much, so my mom will kind of take note of what I eat so I don't make myself sick).  It's just things happen throughout the day and I'll have no memory of them. 4) I have super intense and sudden mood changes. I'm not sure if this is a part of DID, but I've noticed how quickly my mood can change. I've always shrugged these off as part of episodes, but I'm not sure. I can go from being on the verge of suicide and cutting myself to being completely fine less than 12 hours later. It's so bizarre to me, and I just took it as normal for me. 5) I have very distinct, what I guess you could call, personalities. It's not like I dress different or change my physical appearance, rather very clear *personality* changes. I've noticed I have two I guess you could say: First being very nice, caring, helpful, shy, insecure, and able to keep myself in line and going. This is how I am with everyone except for my sister and mother. Any time I am with them, I am rude, uncaring, confident, snarky, constantly annoyed, and overall completely disgusted by their existence it seems. I thought this could be a personality developed to make sure I'm not longer harmed by them (verbally and physically). If my sister is physical with me now and I don't like to admit it, but I easily hurt her before she can do it to me and I feel no remorse for it, but physical fighting rarely happens. If she says anything verbally to fuck with me or something (I don't even understand why she would be verbally abusive), I have seen myself say some of the worst things to her to the point where you could say I'm being abusive now. I know I am and I don't even care. If my mom tries to talk to me about it, I'm the same way with my words toward her. The confidence I have when I'm around them lets me actually talk back to her; if I was how I normally am, I would never be able to. Even once I'm back to my regular self, I am unable to even feel the slightest bit of remorse for what I've done. I don't know if I'm just a terrible person coping in a terrible way, but I've noticed this and ever since the comment that person made, I've come to this realisation. I'm sorry if I seem like a horrible person, I just can't help it. I don't even realise what I'm doing till I've altered I guess you could say. Am I just a fucked person or actually suffering with something?",13Jul2020,1

86,"I spent a bit of time deciding what subreddit this was most appropriate for. I come looking for advice and some direction. 

My aunt is in her 60's and from what I know, has always been a paranoid person. Thinking neighbors wished her ill will, that they were spying on her, same with her coworkers. She also believes she is in tune with and experiences paranormal situations. (Like getting telepathic messages from loved ones that reveal information about the future)

The paranoia crippled her so much it eventually led her to not be able to hold down a job, and not have any friends outside of family. Which means she has barely left the house for anything in 40 years. I believe this has made her detach from reality.

From neighbors spying on her, it derailed into a police officer sending her telepathic messages that he was an agent of the devil (this has lasted 14 years and counting) and now has derailed further into her thinking that the world will end in October. 

She says nonsensical things and does mental gymnastics like that the economy will collapse and that's why we can't trust Paypal and that this is all indicative of an upcoming rapture (she's deeply religious as well). 

She has repeatedly refused treatment, because no psychiatrist will believe she's telling the truth. She obviously believes what she's saying is true and that everyone else is being difficult. 

Right now she feeds off of conspiracy videos on Youtube and articles that confirm her bias. 

My family gets upset at her and try to intimidate her with outbursts (like telling her to stop saying those things angrily), but I don't think we should be speaking to her that way. 

I really don't know how to help her. Tonight she was so upset that she threatened me physically because I refused to believe her. She has no job and no savings so she lives with us.

I’ve been thinking this for a long time, but for almost a year now i’ve been having either 
1: really uncomfortable or unsettling dreams
2: straight up horrifying nightmares
And it’s really making me sad. I don’t think i’ve had a normal/good dream in a really, really long time. 

My nightmares lately have been featuring ghosts, or demons maybe? Entities that i’ve never seen in real life, but look horrifying in my nightmares. When I wake up I usually wake up in fear. 

Some of my “better”(but still weird)dreams will still be uncomfortable. I might kill someone, or die in the most random way(one of which was being that I accidentally touched a bomb and straight up blew up). A common theme i’ve noticed is that i’ll usually be in distress in most of these nightmares. It’s all just really, really weird. 

It’s been harder for me to sleep too, I can’t sleep now unless I have at least one light on and i’ve been super restless these past few days. Takes me way too long to fall asleep. Maybe this all has something to do with my mental health? Who knows.

I provide level 2 IT support for a very large law firm (over 1000 staff nationwide) and have been out struggling with motivation and satisfaction in my job as of late. I often have to deal with stressed out people who take it out on IT or have unreasonable requests and refuse any answer other than the one they want. Pandemic hasn't helped this situation obviously.

Today i was in a meeting with my manager who raised with me that a couple of staff had contacted him regarding my not so polite behaviour in some very specific instances. Im not denying any of this as i know ive been a bit short with people lately, though a little concerned that it got brought direct to my manager on the first instance (inversely if someone is rude to me i have no recourse, that's 'just part of the job').

Work is aware of my situation with anxiety and I have told them that I am not coping too well during pandemic. I am however very nervous about being too honest and keep finding myself pretending im doing a lot better than I really am just to reassure them that I'm fit for the job as I don't want to get stranded so far from my home with no job during this time.

I've been talking to friends and family as much as possible, arranging phone appointments with my psychiatrist from home, calling the public service support lines (called Lifeline here) when I really need to vent right then and there. I've been taking my medication regularly, and trying to eat relatively healthy and regularly. I just feel it's still not enough and I'm on a trajectory to lose my job.

Its a stretch but has anyone been in a similar situation with work and has some advice or tricks to manage this better?",13Jul2020,1
100,"I realized today that 90% of my time I spend thinking about my past.  
I am going through conversations that happened, analyzing peoples answers that happened in the past, beating myself for my mistakes, experiencing my failures again, which led me to a state that I am now in - very low self esteem, and especially being obsessed and convinced how my colleagues and people I work with think I am stupid and not worthy. This is also the same opinion that I have of myself.  
Today I found out this is called rumination.  
I think it is way worse than I though and it is definitely the reason why I cannot enjoy this life.  


How can I break this cycle? How can I stay in the present? I am almost never in the present and I want to change.",13Jul2020,1
101,"I spent a long time writing a very long post. Deleted it all and im just gonna try and keep it short and sweet.

Im 27(m) and im in a bad place. Lost my job of 8 years in Jan due to my own errors and laziness, been married for 6 years and very close to divorce. My 4 year old son is picking up traits of me that I don't like.

I feel empty inside. A shell of a human. I can be incredibly narcissistic, and honestly just not a nice person. only ever behind closed doors though. To all my friends im upbeat, supportive, kind, caring, loving life and living it to the fullest (everything I want to be and should be doing).

I haven't been a great husband at all. Doing the bare minimum for our marriage and around the house. I really wasn't helpful when my son was born and honestly have only just started doing more since I lost my job.

I don't want to be like this. I have no drive, no ambition,
I'm addicted to gaming (it allows a lot of productive things though to with potential career opportunities). I'm overweight, always tired, I just don't want to do anything.

I just feel stuck. I love my wife and son. I want to give them everything they deserve, I want to be everything they deserve, but whenever I get a chance, something inside me just stops me.

I've been to counselling before, and felt like it was no help. Everything I was told, I felt was just common sense. I feel like I know everything I should do to help myself, I just don't do it for some reason. I have no idea why. I want to be a better person, father, husband but I just can't even slightly start. But If I don't, I'm probably going to be homeless with nothing soon and with no reason to live.

There's a lot more to the story (as there always is) such as traumatising childhood etc. but to be honest, I feel like I'm a child in an overweight man's body and I just don't know what to do...Help?

102,"My neighbors are calling the police on a neighbor-woman who is shouting incredibly disorienting things to herself at all hours of the day and night. I am wondering if there is any better recourse for those who may be interested in finding her aid, rather than leaving her in the hands of the police on a weekly basis. I live in Austin, Texas. This neighbor is disruptive enough to guarantee herself a weekly police visit. Her condition seems persistent, likely to include substance abuse (she's often shouting for drugs) and I don't feel okay about letting the situation continue without looking for a more enlightened way of handling the situation.

With the combination of a good support system of friends and family, antidepressants, and (mostly) taking care of my body. I have realized that I will never truly be ""okay"" it's just not how I am wired, and I come to terms with that truth and used it to my advantage to better myself mentally, it has been tough but with Cannabis I have finally found the perfect mindset to have, and that is to view your struggles with mental health as changes in the weather,  and not in the cheesy  ""ThEReS AlWays A RaiNboW at ThE EnD of StORMs"" type of phrase that only ""non-depressed"" people can say with enthusiasm. It's a serious look into it that only being extremely stoned can bring. Nature has changes in her weather and guess what? We are apart of her. We tend to forget that ALL living beings need the Earth to live. We accept changes in the weather. When its humid as fuck outside in July you look forward to cooler weather because you know its coming. I have decided to view that as my mental state. Its subject to the same weather changes as the rest of nature, I just endure it, make the best of it, and wait for cooler times. Hope that made sense. Hope somone got something from it.

105,The only med I’ve ever taken for anxiety was Ativan since I was misdiagnosed with Bipolar and was constantly taking meds that weren’t for me. It seems that my luck with any type of med other than Ativan has been bad and required numerous trips to the ER. I’ve heard great things about Prozac so far but nothing else really.,13Jul2020,1

107,"I apologize for formatting, spelling errors, grammar, etc. This is my first time posting on reddit :)

Okay so, I'm currently 14, 15 in 3 days, and I feel like my mental health issues are going to drive me to insanity. I'm not going to note everything I've been through, bc that would take to long, and I dont want to seem like a ~quirky~ young girl who's self diagnosing and asking for attention- I genuinely feel like I need help. I also want to say that while I have talked to my mom quite a bit about things shes very dismissive of my problems and says I dont need help; my only other source of support is my best friend but I hate feeling like I'm bothering her with my problems when she has a lot of mental health issues as well.

I havent been diagnosed with anything, but for so many reasons (and my friend who has been verified assured me that my symptoms correlate with what she had in order to be diagnosed) I believe I'm suffering from some sort of depressive disorder, some anxiety disorder, and I have a constant off and off battle with an ED (eating disorder). Lately though I think theres something bigger going on..

 I've been experiencing worse delusions than normal- Going from the normal ""they're staring at you""  ""they hate you""  ""They think you're annoying""  ""They dont want you around"" etc. To being afraid to get up from my bed at night because ""they"" are going to get me. I dont know who they are but everytime I get up I feel like they're watching me. When I go into our kitchen at night to grab something I have to make sure I can see everything around me because ""they're right there."" I speed walk (to not wake anyone up) down the hall to my room so ""they"" dont catch me- as I do do I'm chanting in my head that ""they're going to get you""  ""they can hear you""  ""lock the door or they'll open it""  etc. 

Hallucinations started late may/early June I think, I dont quite remember. At one point it was all so bad I thought I was going through psychosis. I will say that things died down for a while, but I'm beginning to fall back into a depressive state and things are getting worse again. I hear whispers and calls that arent there, I feel bugs crawling all over me and what feels like someone pulling my hair, and I see objects and movement in my room that's not there. It's worse when I get up and see shadows in the darkness- which I'm sure everyone does but it seems too much to be normal. My heart and breathing go crazy, and I can never seem to calm myself down even when I'm sure it's not real. It's not schizophrenia, but i dont think its normal either.

Idk writing it out i feel like I'm complaining about nothing. It's been so long since I've been able to fall asleep in darkness though. During the day I do need to have a lot of stimulation- be doing something with my hands, my mouth, listening to something, visuals, etc. So I'm not sure if me needing headphones in and watching something to be able to sleep is strange; but usually it's so I'm not paying attention to the things I see and hear in the darkness that I know arent there. I know it's bad, but I also cant use a nightlight because the shadows they cast scare me :/

I feel like a baby, scared of everything. My mom said it's because I stay up so late- I have trouble sleeping and at the beginning of quarantine i was staying up all night and sleeping all day. It's never triggered a panic attack, but I have had fits where I cant stop sobbing I'm so terrified. Not to mention half of one of my walls is a mirror (it's my closet), it can be helpful in making sure I can see all areas of my room, but also adds to reflections and shadowy figures. I was convinced for at least a month that someone was in my room, or that there was a camera in my closet (still think there might be). I only feel safe at night if I have my phone with me, and even then barely. And during the day time I rely on my two dogs to ""protect me"" and sometimes bribe them with treats to come with me to different areas of my home.

My moms side of the family has some mental health issues, the most severe case is probably my moms sister who has crippling anxiety with constant severe panic attacks (but I think its PTSD from many things). Besides that it's mainly addiction which I have none of. My dads side i have no idea, he was quite the drug addict but idk if that would've affected me since it's not like my mom was doing drugs while she was pregnant with me (she did smoke cigarettes though). My issues (not the paranoia just depression, anxiety, ed) started in 5th-7th grade I'm not sure exactly and it's just getting worse. My mom cares I guess, when my 7th grade teacher confronted me about   !!TW!!!  cutting and whatnot my mom said we should get me therapy and she would help. We never did, and everyonce in a while she asks if I'm okay. When I told her about my ED after I had gotten through it on my own she told me she noticed when I stopped eating, and now she makes sure I do. She tries. We talked about my self harm habits not too long ago which she for some reason thought I just got over, she said that if I got to 90 days we would go do something fun together which is nice. I'm currently at 84 but I dont think I'll last once summer is over. My ED is slowly coming back, and idk how im going to deal with my anxiety once im actually able to go out and have to see people again.

Anyways, im sorry, haha. Enough complaing from me. I just need help and im not sure what to do. I feel very alone, and while I'm not at a super low point right now I can feel it coming and I'm not sure how to stop it. I just want to be able to leave my room at night without fear, or be home alone and feel safe walking around. Yes I've been through traumatic experiences, but nothing right before I started experiencing the bad paranoia (which I will say my mom has some of but not anything like mine). I just dont know what my problem is or how to deal with it.

108,"Some background: 
I’m a gay dude and was sexually harassed by my supervisor last November. He also bullied, coerced and intimated me. I’m now in therapy. 

These thoughts I experience are always awful, violent thoughts. Always very disturbing and sometimes directed towards my boyfriend. The hurt I get when they are directed towards him is too much and I think has contributed towards my depression. 

Does anyone else here have them? 

Are these thoughts a sign of PTSD or similar?",13Jul2020,1
109,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to go to talk about this, but I can’t think of any other subreddit, sorry in advance if I mess up on anything.

For background, I’m a 22 year old female, and I’ve dealt with general anxiety, social anxiety, and depression since I was about 14.

So I have had this thing for quite some time (it started happening around 15 or 16 I think? I can’t remember exactly when) and I’m not sure what it is? Basically I do these ticks, a lot of the time it’s just a squeak or hum, sometime it’s sound like I’m doing adlibs in a song, if I’m alone I’ll sort of talk to myself quietly, say a word or small sentence that pops into my head, and occasionally I’ll do random hand gesture. But these ‘ticks’ dont happen that often like I see with most people who have Tourette’s, and I mostly have control over them if I feel one coming on and the feeling is not that intense (if that makes sense?). They mostly occur if I’m tired and my brain isn’t fully focused, also if I’m anxious or stressed, or times when I just can’t seem to focus. The ‘talking to myself’ mostly occurs if I’m recalling something awkward that I did or something that made me uncomfortable? (I usually say stuff like ‘bitch’ or ‘ i fucking hate you’). 

Some people do have a milder form of Tourette’s, but also from what I remember learning about it (I’m not sure tho so correct me if I’m wrong) is that Tourette’s is something that people are born with and not something that they can develop later in life, so since I’ve only been dealing with this since i was a teen, I don’t think I have it?

I’ve been researching this so quite a while I think not long after it started, but I can’t seem to find any answer or leads to what it could be. Is it part of my anxiety or depression? Do I in fact have a very mild form of Tourette’s ? Or is it something else completely? 

If anybody has any insight on what I’m dealing with or anything like that I’d really appreciate you sharing.",13Jul2020,1
110," I hope this all makes sense. I basically feel like years of excessive introspection has left me hyperaware and hypersensitive of absolutely everything in quite a negative way. This started off as quite a nice thing because it suddenly gave me this great self awareness of ‘doing things’, watching TV, having a meal, social interactions. I’m also hyperaware of the social roles we play in life, the social cues we give off to each other, if they’re authentic or not or learned from movies and the culture we engage with. I question everything and analyse everything, it’s exhausting. After a while, this newfound awareness just took over my life, and I struggle to do anything without being hyperaware of it. Sometimes this hyperawareness makes me question my own authenticity in doing things. I feel like I’m looking at a mirror reflecting my image back into another mirror behind me, it’s an endlessly ever increasing analysis of *analysis*.

112,"I (21F) was diagnosed with borderline personallity disorder impulsive type. Apperantly it’s an alternate version of borderline.

I ended up leaving the hospital with a life-changing diagnosis, but with no actual understanding of what that meant.

113,"I grew up in a quite a toxic home, with a father who I'm now certain has some severe mental health issues - he was extremely aggressive, controlling and had OCD. I developed depression at 17, but had the opportunity to move out to university at 18.

I was in such a bad place and I think I had just been conditioned to be controlled that I didn't even consider it and ended up staying in this family environment for another 9 years til I had the courage to move out at 27.

I can't stop beating myself up - if I had moved out at 18 to university, whatever would have happened it would have been better than staying in that environment. I also have two older brothers with mental health issues and I became quite enmeshed with them during those years.

I don't know what to do or say to make myself feel better. I made a terrible mistake in not moving out earlier and it is my fault - my responsibility. I could have made me life better and I didn't.

I don't know where to turn or what to think to make myself feel better - it feels unbearable. I lost my twenties through making this decision, I don't know that I can forgive myself. I look at people in their twenties enjoying life and it breaks my heart. I might be further along the path than I am now if I had had that courage and foresight at 18.

It can be very rapid as times and it's always worse when I'm trying to sleep. I'm always panicking about the same exact things every single night. Several events happened to me throughout 2017-2018 that I can't stop worrying about. There are a few people whose voices I keep hearing in my head (not auditory hallucinations). I haven't talked to these people in years, but they're always dominating my mind. 

I've had a CT scan of my sinuses and an MRI of my done. My results were normal. My ear may pop several thousands of times throughout a night. Some nights are worse than others. I may take anti-psychotics at night to help me sleep. I saw a psychiatrist back in 2018. He diagnosed me with GAD.

126,"I'm (52F) going to be homeschooling my kids (12F and 10M) this year, and quite possibly for a number of years going forward. None of us are neurotypical; I have bipolar disorder, anxiety, and ADD, both kids have ADD, at least one of them has anxiety and I suspect the other one does too, and I'm seeing signs of early bipolar in my son, and my daughter has learning disabilities that have seriously impacted her self esteem. I've found the skills I've learned in therapy to be, quite literally, life saving after having grown up in a home where all emotions were considered bad, tears and displays of emotion were considered a sign of weakness even for girls, and we were taught very young that no one anywhere at any time cares how you feel so you damn well better keep it to yourself, all the time, permanently. 

As a result of all that, I've taken very much the opposite approach when raising my own kids - learning about and healing my own emotional health, and helping my kids learn about and manage theirs, is one of the most important things I've ever done as a mom and a person. I want to semi-formalize that into our homeschool curriculum. I'm not a therapist, but I've read a lot and learned a lot and been in therapy most of my life (surprised, I bet! haha) and I'm a good compassionate mom, so I'm at least as qualified as any other mom to do this. I started a list of topics and wanted to post it for some feedback and input here. 

Here's what I have as a beginning: 

* Journaling for emotional and mental health (we will all journal, they will be private and not read or graded, this is just to establish the habit), including some prompts if they want them. Maybe some assigned work on specific topics
* Resiliency - keeping going when you feel like you want to quit, and learning that you CAN 
* Calming your screaming monkey brain 
   * basic lesson on what causes this (fight/flight/f response)
   * deep breathing (4 in/6 out)
   * When to get a grownup
* Cognitive restructuring/affirmations (especially for my daughter's self esteem issues)
   * basic lesson on what it is, why it works, how to use it for your own benefit 
   * following this up with a daily practice on affirmations with my daughter
* Speaking your mind - respectfully 
   * How to say what you need to say and be true to yourself without being nasty or rude to others in the process - even, especially, to parents and authority figures (only took me 50 years to learn this, hoping to save them some time)
* Me vs. Us vs. Them 
   * Knowing your own identity vs. being part of something bigger, how to navigate this (especially as they enter adolescence)
   * Dealing with peer pressure, love and sex and relationships, etc. while being true to yourself 

I envision these as one-off lessons followed by ongoing conversations, and would love to know what other topics you think should be added.",13Jul2020,1
127,"Amongst my mental health issues, my anxiety is the hardest to deal with. I have issues socially and all that shabang. But I also have another anxiety issue, which I don't really know how to label. I basically have this thing where my brain inserts horrible, perverted and creepy thoughts about people I care about into my normal stream of consciousness. I've been dealing with this for a long while, and it's hard, but I've basically realised my brain has *rules* and as long as I follow them I'm A - ok. When I get these thoughts, I have to try to mentally just block them out/not think about them, otherwise they'll realise I'm getting upset by them and then get worse. And most of the time this works okay, but every few months I get into this state where I *can't* block them out, and they just keep streaming in and making me feel really bad. It's usually also targeted at only one person (of which it could be literally anyone I know), which makes it worse, because I feel like I'm obsessed with them which makes me feel even more shit. When this happens, there's no stopping them, or 'accepting' them and letting it go, it's just there and it's horrible, like my own brain is betraying me. This sometimes gives me panic attacks and makes me feel much more suicidal than normal. There's no way to tell how long it lasts and there's no way to cope with it. Sometimes it'll be days, or weeks, or months. So why am I writing this? Well, it's happened again, but this time it's started *right at the beginning of my fucking holiday*.

When I woke up, I wasn’t really sure if I was even alive (honestly I have no idea how I’m alive right now, it was a lot of pills) so anyways, I kept thinking “gosh, maybe I AM dead? Maybe I’m on the verge of death??? What if I’m in a coma????” And for some reason the coma thing REALLY stuck with me. I would constantly “try to wake up” by hitting and pinching myself. Sometimes I would see an edgy post on Instagram that says “wake up” and freak the heck out. I saw a funeral while we were driving, that made me think too. There wasn’t anything that I wouldn’t shape into some sort of sign.

Yesterday I decided to write to myself as a form of therapy. I really didn’t take it seriously at first, I would constantly write a dumb remark after every serious thing I said. After a while, I started getting into it, as if I were venting to someone. I started writing about the coma thing, it took about two pages. When I was done writing I read over it. It was like reading an edgy fanfic, one that made absolutely zero sense! One that was written by a friggen seven year old!!!

I couldn’t believe I legitimately thought all that! I felt really lame! I couldn’t believe that I did all that dumb stuff either, like gosh! People really like me! When I was at the hospital for two weeks everything turned to chaos in my family! I couldn’t even imagine what it would be like if I were dead! So I thought “HEY! YOU GOTTA CLEAN UP YOUR ACT! PEOPLE LOVE YOU, YOU AREN’T IN A COMA, QUIT BEING SUCH A DRAMA QUEEN AND LOVE YOURSELF!” Haha it was like a wholesome meme! :)

So I guess it was embarrassment that seems to be fixing me? Uh, also I’m taking my medicine again? (gosh it’s totally the medicine) I took a big step also! I walked to a park by my house and thREW AWAY ALL MY SELF HARM TOOLS!!! I’m really improving even though it’s been three days! I think it’s funny, I’m not a writer, I’ve always thought writing is lame, but gosh! It really helped! So yeah, I’m back to my sweet, obnoxious, hyperactive self! I’m really happy!!! :D",13Jul2020,1

I’m going THROUGH IT through it right now but there’s too much going on in my life to fit in a post. (The TLDR is that I hate myself so much that it’s starting to affect my relationships with other people and I don’t know what to do. )

132,"  Holy cow, feeling the pain is a really strange feeling. You know how they say each window says a different story? Pain is a different window. You see the same things that you were seeing yesterday, but without the rose-tinted glasses. And suddenly, everything looks different. Your room, your neighborhood, every single thing. 

As a 20 something-year-old, my biggest superpower while growing up was trying to escape pain and suffering and any sort of discomfort with the readily available form of gratification source. Once it was random chat sites and porn, then it was Tinder, sometimes it is food. Does not matter. As I grew older, I started growing crippled in the prison I was creating for myself. It is a dangerous negative feedback loop. 

You feel shitty --&gt; Instant gratification --&gt; More shit

And years of hurting myself and many other people, I want to escape out of this self-harming escape I have mastered. I am not even sure if I will be able to, but I should know by now that escaping from pain is oxymoronic on its own. You never really escape anything. You got to feel it, and give it time. There is no other way around other than to let the heals wound. Although I have no idea about the root cause of many of my issues, I see the end result. I can start from there and do reverse engineering to fix the cause. But I feel utter lack of control when I experience pain. It is like this strange restlessness that forces me to do something, anything to stop feeling what I am feeling, just for the time being. 

But none of this denies the fact that every single event was a result of a decision I made. I was not ignorant, I was fully aware of the consequences. I knew my acts would make me more miserable and would not let me find happiness. I still opted, every single time. I cheated on people. Not just once or twice, again and again.   
 

And today morning, when I finally decided I am going to feel every inch of the fucking pain I am feeling for however long it takes, I had a strange epiphany. I do not know how to put it in words, it was a feeling. It was a feeling of feeling miserable which I have not felt in years. Everything is boring. It is sunny and warm outside, it reminded me of the time when I was a child. I did not have friends and I would just be by myself and bored. I know this feeling from somewhere in the memory lane. It sucks and it is miserable. I am going to feel it completely. No more escaping from this.",13Jul2020,1
133,"Hi, 

I was hoping that someone who is on antidepressants of any kind could help me…

I have been suffering from depression since I was a kid and I believe that it is simply due to chemical imbalance in my brain. However, when I was a kid nobody really took my mental illness seriously, so I was never given any professional help (also I live in a country where mental illness is still viewed as something shameful so therapy or medication for mental illness is not very common here).

Anyways, throughout the years I was able to develop few strategies that help me manage my depression (exercising, breathing techniques, just simply accepting the fact that I am ill, and some days will be really bad etc.).

However, recently I have been experiencing what I believe to be anxiety. And I can’t deal with it. It is the worst. 

And I know that if I give it some time, I will probably be able to develop some coping strategies for this as well, but it is seriously affecting my life and I have some important things ahead of me so I don’t want them to get ruined by something that could maybe be cured?

But now... even tough that I am willing to try medication I am super scared of the weight gain that comes with it. 

To give you some background – I was anorectic for several years and then managed to rebuild my relationship with food and my body without any professional help again. I now eat well and have physique I would hate to lose. I am also semi-professional athlete and hence any weight changes would first, mess me up mentally and secondly, ruin all the potential things I could achieve in my sport career.

Hence, I wanted to ask if whether gain is actually always a side effect of antidepressant and whether there are things you can do to cancel it out? I understand that antidepressants effect everyone differently, but I am thinking that if I see experiences of several different people that could give me some picture...

I have done some basic research and found that while the actual cause is unclear scientist suspect it to be either metabolic changes or changes in appetite.  

I am not worried about appetite changes as I am tracking my food intake and everyday eat whatever I need to be eating regardless of my appetite, but the metabolic changes worry me.

I know that the best thing would be just to try it out, but as I said I can’t risk any weight gain due to my sport activities. On the other hand, I also have important university related things in the future and the anxiety makes all the studying, presenting etc. difficult.

So... could you please share you experiences, opinions, advices etc.? It will be very much appreciated!",13Jul2020,1
134,"TW: rape, pedophilia 

When I was a child I was sexually abused by my father for years. He never got caught. My parents divorced a few years later due to his drug addition. 
Everyone that I’ve told about this, which is only a handful of people, believe that he was arrested for it. He wasn’t. I feel so guilty knowing that I lied to people about this and I don’t even know why I did.
I think it’s because I wanted the closure and the make believe of “oh, well, he is gone now and he can’t come back anymore.”
I’m terrified of telling the truth about it to my partner of over a year. I know I need to come clean. I’m just worried that he’ll think I’m a terrible person and that he’ll leave.",13Jul2020,1
135,"I am in the United States, just for context.

I've suffered from depression, coupled with anxiety and ADD, since I was a child. It effected the way I communicate with people and I'm still learning how to act like a normal member of society at the age of 27. My mother left when I was 16, just took off one night and never came back, she told everyone she came into contact with that my little sister and I were dead and she had a falling out with her mother. I mean she did have a falling out with her mom, taking off and abandoning us like that doesn't exactly leave you in good standing with family. 

I started trying to rebuild my life, she had pulled me from school my freshman year and lied to my grandmother saying I was being home schooled and that I'd get in trouble if I told her the truth. I tried to make friends, but at that point I was that weird kid and no one wanted to be my friend other than the few that had stuck with me since middle school. I ended up graduating ahead of my class when I went through a computer program meant for me to catch up to my grade.

I kept going, I went and got my CDL at the age of 21 because I always wanted to be a truck driver. I always loved watching my grandfather drive trucks, I wanted to follow in his footsteps. I made it, I had done it, I was on my way to taking my life back completely! Then my co-driver rear ended another semi while I was sleeping in the bunk.. It shattered my legs. I can still walk unaided, but got it hurts. My knees pop, I over compensate by using my back which makes that hurt. But I wasn't going to let that stop me, I was going to get back on the proverbial horse and live my life the way **I** wanted. But I couldn't, I couldn't get over the crippling PTSD from the wreck. I couldn't sleep most nights because my legs throbbed and other nights I couldn't sleep because the nightmares. I can still hear the fire when sleeping most nights..

I met my husband, he helped me through so much, we became so close and he is my rock. As I am his. We ended up in another wreck, we both survived unhurt, but it brought up so many old memories. I still remember being on the side of the highway, hearing the fire that didn't exist, hyper ventilating, crying. It's almost as if it happened yesterday, I'm still terrified of being the passenger of any vehicle. I know in the back of my mind I'm just as likely to be in another accident even if I'm driving, but when I don't have that sense of control I panic. I squeal like a stuck pig when something scares me.

We grew closer, then his dad died. At this point I'm starting to think I'm bad luck because this just keeps happening. I know it's life, but I can still hear my mom saying stuff like this is my fault. It's almost as if she's still living with me, I mean she is in a way? I have to fight back feelings like that, feelings that hurt. Worthlessness, anger, hurt, and just generally being scared of being abandoned again. We went back to our home state to help his mother, because that's what people do. Things got worse after we got back, his whole family fell apart.. I mean I kind of expected that, I remember the same thing happening when my great grandfather died.

We came back to the place we've called home for the past few years, ended up having his mother live with us. As well as her animals, a dog and a cat. I thought things were going well, we were having fun, she was enjoying our company. Then she left to go back to our home state, we knew she was going to visit family for a party and what not, she told us she'd be back. Suddenly she wasn't coming back, she was staying, due do COVID-19 worries. Fine, fine, she's got health problems and I don't want her to get seriously sick. We found out through accident, we were sharing an amazon account and were trying to find a tracking number for dog food, that she wasn't coming back. She was looking for a house down there, she moved into a new house with her daughter.

She left her animals up here, along with our two we struggle. But we won't take them to a shelter, they're both older and quite honestly would be the first ones put down in a shelter. We can't take them to a rescue because COVID has everyone bursting at the seems. I can't take an animal to the shelter knowing that they won't make it back out because of their age, attitude, and training. The cat uses the litter box but still pees on the couch sometimes, yes I clean it every day, and generally has a crappy attitude. I can understand it, she had one of her owners disappear, then the other one moved her across country, then all of a sudden the other one decided she wanted to leave.

I would send them down to her but her daughter won't allow the cat or the dog, so they'll just end up in a shelter down there most likely. I know the shelters down there. They. Are. Horrible. 

Now we're trying to move, we've cut all contact with her and are just done. All of those feelings of abandonment I felt with my mom I felt all over again, I had developed a relationship akin to a maternal one with this woman. She knew of my history, she knew how this would hurt. She knew it would hurt her son, she's always prioritized him last. She's just like her mother, anything that has a penis is a problem, but always tries to act like he's *so important*. Yet she doesn't care. We got a letter from her that was so freaking toxic. The same kind of crap that I would have heard from my mother, he heard from his. *""You wouldn't be here without your parents.""* and *""Your dad would be so sad for how you're treating me.""* I haven't seen anyone like this since my mom left me. She tries to act so sweet and then turns around to become so vicious with a sweet undertone so other people don't think she's as bad as she is.

We need some help with things but we don't have a lot of friends to rely on. We both grew up pretty lonely because of mother issues, I have maybe three friends in total that still talk to me and just don't exist on my friends list. He doesn't really talk to anyone, I'm worried he's going to work himself into an early grave like his dad. I try getting him to talk to me when he's angry but then I get angry and take over the conversation. I'm trying to get better about that and catch myself but I know it bothers him. Now that we're taking care of two animals without assistance is a problem.

I don't know why I just spilled my whole life story, I've been stewing on this for a few days now. On if I should even post this or not. I guess I just need to know that the world isn't all terrible. I've had plenty of good things happen to me, but my god the bad out-weighs the good right now and I don't know how to handle it. I don't plan on self harming, I haven't done that since I was 15, but I'm trying to hard to not withdraw into myself right now. I need help mentally first and foremost. Financial is something I will have to figure out, I've been told to do a GoFundMe, but my social circle is so small and they all live around her.

The issue here is I really don't know. If I knew the reason I could fix it and cry. There are times when my emotions are SO intense that I need to cry.

I have always been in the “popular” group but never really had any friends which likely won’t make sense but like I have never had anyone to confide in or talk to in a real manner. I am a privileged white male who is in a very wealthy family which ultimately makes me think I am just seriously fucked up because there is litterally no probable cause for my emotional numbness. I have been suicidal before not because I am sad and don’t have support but because I am not sad or happy or anything and just felt worthless and messed up.

I just got my results and while they aren't bad, especially considering how I flunked through most of my classes senior year, it's nowhere near as good as my friends did.

Everyone I know has gotten a much higher score than I did and since I obviously feel shitty about it, I've decided to not text anyone back or respond to their calls.

They're my friends and I love them but I also know that they're calling to discuss results and share their good news. As selfish as it is, I really can't support them or be happy for them right now because of my result and how bad I feel.

The anxiety I had before I checked my result has just gotten worse as I try to figure out what to do about my college and stuff now.

To make matters worse I can't help but feel like a horrible friend for just disappearing and not responding to their great scores.

As if that wasn't enough, one of my friends decided to publicly post our scores on her Instagram, the way everyone does in my grade. But since she didn't know mine she just posted a '?' symbol next to me and that's making my anxiety even worse.

I feel as though everyone I know is now wondering what my marks are that my friend had to post a '?' 

Further, every relative is calling up my parents asking them how I did, comparing my scores to their children's scores.

I intended to make up for lost time on the project this weekend but instead I indulged in pure escapism, reading THREE books. Now it's Monday and I still haven't even started. This is a project that will take me about seven uninterrupted hours.

I don't feel that telling my boss the truth (""I'm sorry, I've really been spiraling and I haven't even started"") is an option, but I need to update her today. What can I say? I'm a grown adult and need to take some responsibility.

156,"So, I’ve always struggled with depression. It’s negatively impacted any friendships or relationships I’ve had. Past few months I’ve done what my therapist and every web search on the subject recommends. I exercise, eat healthy, get plenty of sleep, etc etc. None of this has been working but I’m still powering through in hopes of one day this helping. What absolutely sets me off is every site I go to in searching for things to do to treat depression all of them have listed “Do something you enjoy” and I don’t think they fully understand depression. I don’t like doing anything when I am depressed. There is no “fun thing” to do since (with depression mindset) nothing is fun. The only thing this is doing is making me feel this strong divide between myself and people who are able to actual enjoy things.

So I went off the rails on the weekend, got totally wrecked on gin, huge meltdown, lots of crying and spewing, all the fun stuff. I feel like I've been stuck in the past lately, I feel so low and full of doubts about myself and my place in life. I just want to lie down and sleep so I can not care about anything for a while.

I have a video interview this evening and I usually fall to pieces because I get sooo anxious about them, I doubt my own abilities and experience, I feel like I'm a fraud and they'll know that I'm lying about everything.

I'm trying to ignore this voice. I really want to get out of my current dead-end job, I want the extra money so I can afford my own place and have my own independence and quiet. I know I could do the job really, I'm a former teacher and my skills definitely carry over to this job as a work coach. I just, artghffhjggjddlbsbxlxld, yknow?

I've been like this for 5 years, sometimes worse, sometimes I'm doing better. I have friends and basically only take care of my hygiene when I know I'm leaving the house, gross I know. 
As my finals approached I started getting worse and worse with this.
Now they're over and I actually passed with a really good result (in my opinion, hah).

That was 3 weeks ago. And the time to start applying for university began 2 weeks ago, all my friends have already done it, meanwhile I can't get myself to even shower more than once a week. It feels like I have a blockade, and of course the internet tells me this kind of behavior is a symptom of depression.

I've been to therapists, during one of my good phases I took a test with her and it determined that I had no depression or any other problem. It bummed me out that really nothing came out of it, I guess because it told me I was simply a lazy piece of ****. Maybe I am? 

I used to have horrible anxiety from 8 to 16, went away. I used to feel extremely depressed at 13, I don't feel like that anymore. Now I just don't care about anything.

Especially during my junior cert year (Big exam year over here) she really hurt me, while I was going through so much stress i felt like she was const kicking me down with insults to do well and with her always making SURE with me that I was doing well, at least to her standard. Completely ignoring the fact I was going through mental breakdowns in and outside of school with nobody helping me during those times and instead just looking at me falling. I tried many times to tell her. “Can I please go to counselling“ or something to at least make me feel better. But I was always met with “You’re fine! There is nothing wrong with you.” All the bullshit. “It’s not in your best interest anyways” All of these negative thoughts have been coming back to me again since the whole pandemic because of her luck in not taking covid19 seriously she caught it and became quite sick with it, bed bound and yada. But over this period she has been hurting my whole family and me especially again. Calling me “Horrible Person” for no bringing her something to her bedroom etc. I have also gained bad headaches from the stress recently over worthless exams in school recently, I have tried to reach out to friends for help but they always tell me the fucking “Sounds like she is just being a mother” I don’t know what to do anymore.

If anything is ever good I always still find things that I could do better. I play disc golf, I get very upset with myself after playing a bad round. IRacing if I have a bad race. These are examples and will lead to me quitting because my frustration just isn't worth it or enjoyable. I try and do my job as best as possible and if I have a tough stretch that really eats me. For example when I play disc golf. If I am throwing a forehand and I keep turning it over and I keep making that mistake I get extremely mad because I know the mistake I am making and it is not hard to stop doing it.

Someone can say I did a good job but I will find reasons to not like it, something I could have done better. I now have a lovely girlfriend and I am very happy with her. I am concerned because if I ever go back down that road I hope I don't get the motivation to kill myself because no one would be able to talk me out of it since I can only see my own opinion. The part that truly scares me is I know how people could get to that point and how they don't have control. That one day I might go back down that path and lose control.

I want to be clear. I want to be to the point where going back down this path isn't an opinion. I don't want to start something with my girlfriend and leave her with kids behind.

170,"At any point in time, humans have the capacity and potential to solve their own problems – big and small. When it comes to stress management, you can do a lot to help yourself too, apart from attending [stress management therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/) by a mental health professional. There are plenty of research-based methods that you can use to manage stress. These tried and tested methods help you connect with your inner self and cope with stress in a healthy manner. Read on to know more. 

1. **Reframing -** This method of stress management encourages you to look at a negative situation in an alternate light. By viewing this situation positively or neutrally you may realize that it is not all that bad and that you may have gotten carried away with the negative emotions that the situation may have brought. 

**2.** **Plan-Plan- Plan -** We often find ourselves in the mayhem of too many things to do and too little time to do them. We may find ourselves wrapped up in tight schedules, struggling to meet deadlines and declutter our day which can be stressful. To avoid this – plan your day to a tee. Make checklists, use a planner, organize yourself. 

3. **Slow Down; Relax -** This method of [stress management](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/) is a no-brainer, and yet, you will be surprised how much you may need to hear this. Relaxation techniques can cut down your stress to half just by NOT thinking of your problem, getting some fresh, clean air in your lungs, and doing nothing. Relaxing does not always mean diverting your attention by doing something else. Sometimes it means just lying down and doing nothing. Take control of your thoughts, your breathing, your actions, and you will end up being in control of your life. 

4. **Work to Your Strengths -** Studies have shown that when you are stressed, creeping into your comfort zone can be extremely therapeutic. You may feel the need to challenge yourself every single day, but once in a while, going back to what you do best can not only be relaxing, it can also be something that is essential for your well-being. 

5. **Learn to Forgive Yourself -** Studies show that individuals who forgive themselves easily and let their insecurities go are far less stressed and at a risk of developing a mental illness. One of the first rules of [anxiety therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/) is being happy inside and out, being a fulfilled individual, being kind to yourself and loving yourself irrespective of circumstances. Start letting go of things that will not matter a week from today and watch yourself flourish. 

6. **Gratitude and Self-Affirmation -** In the rat race of life we tend to forget how many things there are to be thankful for. We may get caught up with everything that stresses us out, overlooking how many things in life wait for us to embrace them tight and smile. Each day before going to bed, journal in 3 things you are thankful for, and watch how gratitude can teach you how to be positive, mindful, and happy. Furthermore, amidst our busy schedules, we may forget to tell ourselves how proud we are of ourselves. Start your day with self-affirmation. Remind yourself of all the things you have achieved, are capable of and love about yourself. Shower yourself with compliments and appreciation.",13Jul2020,1

175,"Since I was a small child I do have struggles not being good enough. And the truth is, I actually fail in different areas, because I really need to put a lot of effort into something to be good at it. I am just not naturally intelligent, pretty, healthy, disciplined, confident, charming, calm, balanced, etc... and I very easily stressed out or overwhelmed.

So in high school I prioritized looking good and working on my social skills to become more popular (as most teenagers). I spent all my free time with people, I got into skin care, makeup, clothing style. I actually was good in that area at that time, even going on dates. But what I lacked at that time was mental and physical health, hobbies and good school grades, so I had a bad degree.

At the end of high school I found a boyfriend. A very good looking, athletic, charming guy. We were so happy together. Through him I became more introverted and conservative, basically losing the social skills I build up previously as we weren't going out much and I let loose of my friends at that time. But I prioritized college and health in this phase of life, so I basically was doing a lot of sports and getting very good grades and my mental health was great.

Then jumping to years later our relationship struggles so I suddenly realize, that I am all on my own having good grades but no friends, no work experience, no confidence, becoming socially introverted but not having the support of that boyfriend.

So a new phase happend and I basically shifted my priorities to friends, confidence and career this time. I actually put a lot of effort in and within a year I succeeded at this: I made a lot of new friends, thrown three parties, took on two jobs in college, joined a club and pursued hobbies. As you can guess, it stressed me out so much that my grades got worse again and I didn't take care of my body and my mind, I got very unhealthy, gained weight and got depression and anxiety. I let myself go and then lost the boyfriend finally.

Now I back to square one, at my hometown, trying to make everything balanced this time. Comparing myself to other people, I feel like I am not figuring out how to make everything at once. When I hang out a lot with people, I am getting tired. When I need to study a lot I am getting stressed. When I need discipline in one area, I lack discipline in another area. When I work a lot I can not make myself to eat healthy and work out. I feel like it is all too much for me.

I just don't know what to prioritize anymore. I feel like I always fail at something.

Love, friends, mental health, career, body, health, intellectuallity, creativity, ....?

And then there are people like my ex who is easy going and succeeding in all of it. He is rarely stressed out, funny, has a big social circle, disciplined, good at his job, healthy.

181,"I’ll start this off by saying that being ill with anything and having to be hospitalised is not something to be romanticised and desired, I’m in no way promoting this way of thinking but it’s something I’ve struggled with for the longest time and I wanted additional perspective.

From what little bits of my childhood, I remember wanting to be ill. I remember wanting to need to go to hospital. If I got any kind of symptoms, I would really make a point of making sure my parents knew so I could get help. Majority of the time, they would talk it down and say that if it got to a certain point they would take me to a doctor - it usually didn’t. 

This thought has lessened as I’ve gotten older, since being in hospital for legitimate reasons and suffering with depression and anxiety for years, but I still get it from time to time. I keep thinking I’m ill or that I should admit myself to hospital for mental health reasons. There’s the thought that I just don’t want to deal with real life and I want to be looked after but there’s also the thought that I wouldn’t want to lose my independence and being ill is pretty damn awful.

I’m not very good with reddit. I don’t usually post so I don’t know how things are supposed to go but I’ll do my best. 

So to get right into it, the past two weeks or so I’ve been having really low moods and very insecure. I’ve tried to ignore it, I’m usually good with handling my feelings and tried to move on. But it got worse and to me what I’m feeling is insecurity within my relationship with my boyfriend. I’ve never felt so alone or felt like no one cares about me this much. He’s been acting differently and I’ve tried asking him about it multiple times but he just denies it. But after being together for almost 11 months I can tell when he’s being distant.

Today I decided I needed to talk to him properly. Tell him how I feel fully. I don’t really have any friends to talk to so this has sorta been bottling up for a while. I was on the phone to him, quite emotional as I was telling him I was feeling very low and insecure. He just said ‘I’m sorry’ and silence. We sat in silence for a very long time with me just crying on the other end. The longer the silence the more I really questioned how much I meant to him. He is usually quite caring but not now. I cried and apologised for crying and making him upset and he said ‘it’s okay’ and that was it. This is all I’ve gotten out of him. And now we’re on a phone call in silence. He’s being very VERY off with me. He’s hardly speaking to me and when he does his tone sounds very annoyed almost. Obviously this isn’t helping and just making me more upset. I’m not sure what to do or what else I can say but I’ve told him how I’ve felt and he’s acting as if he doesn’t care at all. I feel like he’s losing interest in me and I’m really scared. I love him with all my heart but I honestly don’t think he feels the same way about me anymore. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

He tried to tell me something after a few minutes of saying nothing. He started talking but then didn’t carry on so I asked him what it was. He said he saw his friend was playing a game and wanted to join him but now he’s changed his mind. He asked if he can leave the call to go for a nap. I just agreed as the silent call was just making me feel like shit. He’s acting if he doesn’t care at all. I love him and I don’t want to lose him.

196,"How's it going redditors? I am a 22 year old male with a few mental blocks and pose a question. How do I implement changes to better improve my overall mental well-being?

For about 7-8 years now I have had a looming cloud over my head. A seemingly endless rain cloud that is always pouring day and night. Occasionally I smile and feel that normal melancholy that hazes over my everyday mood. to get down to brass tacks, I have many ""issues"" that cause me to have an almost completely violent response. I understand that maybe  a few of them are caused by regret, guilt, and suppressed emotions boiling deep within. but I also have a problem with my cognitive functions. I find it almost impossible to think for myself and also have issues recollecting past events that normally I would have no issue remembering. I always feel listlessly unmotivated and almost hate going to work. I don't hate the management as individuals but rather they have poor business skills and I'm hyper critical. 

Sorry for rambling, that's another issue I tend to run across. One of the larger more concerning problems I have is with my ability to behave in groups. I tend to be quiet and closed off due to me holding controversial opinions and also being completely oblivious to social queues. One example would be, when people eat, my ears pick up every little sound people make and it makes me violently angry, almost to the point of harming myself or others. This simply won't do as I like having large groups of friends due to me always wanting to socialize. I also play D&amp;D and always getting mad for chewing with their mouth open(which I also happen to think is the nastiest thing a human could do in  a normal situation) and I don't want to think these thoughts.

lastly, I lack a sense of motivation towards anything, I am lazy and I loathe myself for it. I don't want to wallow in self-pity as I feel it is a nasty behavior. I do not want to be a toxic friend as I genuinely care about those around me and do not wish to make enemies(which I know that I can't prevent but I don't want to go out of my way to make enemies either). I want to be motivated as I have many desires and pipe dreams that I really want to bring to fruition. I want to make more money, live comfortably and one day raise children in a house of my own with their loving mother\[whomever that may end up being\]. 

I also have a problem with the romantic side of things but I believe that'll come along with emotional maturity.",13Jul2020,1

I feel like mirrors are evil and will kill me when i look at them or look away. Theres always someone there even in shops i feel people behind me when there isnt. Or when i change the moment where i cant see ill get killed.
I feel like everythings a camera and every car that goes by is watching me. Everyones always watching. Sometimes it feels okay other times it feels sinister. 
I constantly have nightmares and get sleep paralysis. I just always thought everyone felt like there was evil things or people trying to hunt them/ their family.

201,"Okay. I know my phobia is stupid and irrational, but to be honest, most are. It’s not widely known, it took me some searching to even find anyone else who had it.   
I have necroentomophobia. Fear of dead bugs.

I cannot touch a dead insect. It makes me uncomfortable to even know a dead insect is in the same room as me. If I spot a dead spider in the corner, or a dead fly by the window, I can’t concentrate until I’m out of that room or the creature is removed. The more horrible the death, the worse it is. Somebody squashes a spider and even if I don’t see it, if I know it’s happened then I physically feel sick. Same reaction - sickness - if I step on a bug. 

Spiders are the worst. Even a spider that died peacefully, I cannot be near it. Seeing one will put me on edge for ages. Touching one leaves me shaking and cold, and that’s when I’ve worked myself up to it. I had one thrown at me once, and I completely panicked, I was shaky for ages.  


I haven’t explained this to many people after several negative reactions, so I just try unsuccessfully to ignore it. I told my parents, and I was met with “Man up.” and “There’s a stupid phobia for everything. You don’t have it.”  
Even my first real relationship ended when he chased me with a dead fly and *squashed it on me,* knowing how it would affect me. Yeah, he was an ass. 

I know this happens with a lot of phobias, I just needed to vent.

205,"Hello everyone. I'm not a native english speaker and I'm on mobile. 

Little back ground. I'm 34F living in Sweden. I struggle with many mental disorders. Very bad anxiety, OCD and such. Many people even think I may have autism. I have many rules about my apartment. It's my only safe space. The major thing is, all from the outside is not allowed in my home. I disinfect and wash everything i bring in. That's including myself. I have special ways to shower and clean. I even never open my windows as noise and dirt from outside is terrifying to me.No one is allowed in my apartment. Not even my mom or bf. Recently the block of flats I live in started to be renovated. And they want to put some new windows and remake balconies. It's all and nice but I won't be able to handle people changing my windows and strangers being here and all the outside stuff being in my home and destroying all I own. It got to the point I started to have suicidal thoughts as I don't see life after that. I was trying to think of solutions but can't find any where i keep on living with my safe palce gone. It gave me so much stress and filled me with so much fear I don't know who to live anymore and i cry all the time. I'm only still hanging on as my bf is such a great support and we even went to the doctor to look for right therapy and I started to take medication, witch helps a little bit but it's not enough without proper therapy. The thing is there is no way i will get better by the time they renovate. We did try to write to landlords and explaining but they did say its for the best to just install the windows and they are sorry and it will be fast. But that won't work as I know I won't be able to handle it and I'm super sacred and feels like my life,future and safe space are being take away from me. Because they can't have workers just to come in my home without my approval and I didn't agreed on anything. I got send some papers that tells me I will have to present my case in court and explain them why the windows can't be installed in my apartment. I'm really sacred as i never been to court and trying to think what to write and tell them. I want to do my best and have a chance to have life and get better.

208,"Hey all, I just wanted to get some perspectives about therapy. I’ve only ever had a few 15 minutes “sessions” with a one-on-one therapist, many 1 hour group sessions and a CBT bot called Woebot.

I’ve found group therapy to be terribly suited for me and Woebot is great because it provides that “day to day” support but I’ve been wanting to talk to someone about my relationships and sexuality in a way that dives much deeper into the issues at hand, namely a relationship I had when I was young with someone much older than I, so that I can understand my feelings and emotions better.

It’s not that I’m struggling to speak about the relationship or that I just want to get it off my chest, but that I want context to understand why I feel the way I do about it.

What would you suggest I do about it? In my experience, people in the mental health field don’t like to dive right into “the situation” and instead build up to it but that’s not my preference of learning style and it often rubs me the wrong way.

I don’t have money to afford a lot of one on one therapy but I truly believe my most elusive source of unhealthy behavior stems from my sexual desires.

Should I see a sex/relationship therapist? If so, what difference would that make from a regular therapist? Also, how will I know who is qualified to talk about this?

If not, what other resources would you suggest I use to work through that issue?",13Jul2020,1

210,"I've reached a point in my life where I no longer have any distractions. No courses/uni/school, fully locked down bc covid, haven't been close to anyone except my bf for about a year and thats been crumbling for ages now.
I have basically had the perfect life and it chews me up inside that I feel this fucking shit.
I can pin point thr exact day my mental health issues started and its the day my best friend attempted suicide 4 years ago, the day after I had spent the night at theirs complaining about a fight I had with my parents. I have never forgiven myself for that. They called me saying they had taken a bunch of pills and I had to talk them through and convince them to call the ambulance all while getting ready to go to work. 
Then they attempted again the next week only sending a snap chat with hospital sticker things on them in a hospital bed saying 'im okay' as im getting ready to go to school. Then that weekend they stayed at mine and my bf at the time (different now) told me he took a bunch of pills. I was trying to comfort 2 of the people closest to me and convince one to do soemthing (I told his nan and he jjst got mad at me) and console the other one as they witnessed the impact this shit was having on me real time. I will never forget it.
Eventually I broke with ex bc he was a dickhead, learned later pretty sure he lied about taking stuff, cheated on me (which I kinda knew bc i was friends with the chick but I was a pussy and hated confrontation Nd didnt break up with him (biggest regret ever)). 
Friend drifted away bc they dropped out if school and did a TAFE course like yay i was proud of them but they completely ghosted me. I had been through like 4 years of this person's turmoil and then they ghosted me. I was very hurt but I got ober it. 
I thought i had dealt with all these issues but now its coming back to bite me in the ass in the form of the worst panic attack I have ever had in my life.
I started dating another guy who I love so much but both of us have had pretty shitty past relationships, however he takes the cake. Essentially his ex was manipulative, possessive and just not fun to be around.
We started off really good, as most relationships do, but things startwd to pop up everywhere. Last year he had to have surgery and he was bed bound for ages and it took a MASSIVE toll on his mental health and eventually mine.
Then my poppa died, aka the man who kept inspiring me to play music and be creative. He always was do supportive and came to as many of my concerts as possible and would always film me playing piano. 
His last words to me on his death bed were 
'I had a dream about you last night, it was your name splashed across bill boards and people applauding and I could hear you playing and I believe it was a vision into the future' 
That happened in year 12 aka supposed to be the best year of your life. 
My parents are supportive as hell and honestly I never relaised it in high school but now I understand all the times my dad would razz me up so I could learn how to be level headed talking to silly people, forcing me to get ip and go to school every bloody morning even if I just came home after 2 periods or soemthing, I still went. How to keep going when you have absolutely nothing left in you. 
Their lettinf me stay at home and not to rush me getting better and 'finding myself' as dad put it.
I jsut don't know what to do anymore, I have no distractions anymore and now all I have are my thoughts and it is not fun.
Things with my current boyfriend are turning to shit, we've broken up twice before bc we get dramatic and im aware how toxic that is but i always don't have many friends i can talk to so now im so co-dependent it hurts. But we went through so much last year I thought we could get through anything. He has lots and lots of lingering mh issues from his ex and growing up and I am that bitch who thinks she can 'fix and save everyone. I realise now that im older that thats silly and not my responsibility and I love him regardless of what he's going through. But now we've talked about talking a bit less whilst in iso bc were both got our pretty bad mental heslth things going on and so now I have no one.

I’m currently 27 and I’m not suicidal after receiving ECT while hospitalized. But I can tell my mental state is moving in the wrong direction. Part of it is the quarantine/pandemic, part of it is being miserable at my job and part of it is being miserable because of my social life (but that’s kind of tied into the pandemic isn’t it?) 

Well I just spent about an hour trying to talk to my dad about how depressed I’ve been lately and he responded with the following: “we need to figure out what’s wrong with you.” Which left me confused. Don’t we know already? I have major depressive disorder and a generalized anxiety disorder. Idk it just felt dismissive of everything I’ve worked on up to this point. I think his hang up is the fact that he’s been on antidepressants after his father and brother had passed away a number of years ago. So he has this notion that he completely understands depression. So because mine is so much more severe, it can’t just be depression? It has to be something else?

I know some of you are having one of those days where nothing seems to be going right, you feel like nobody wants to talk to you or even see you. Days like these are horrible and nobody deserves to suffer through them alone. People suffer through these days continuously and because of this, they seem to give up hope that something can change. Let me tell you this, it CAN and WILL change. Time heals everything. If it isn’t today, look at tomorrow. If it isn’t tomorrow, look at the next day. Time will change everything, being patient is everything. 

Just remember, everything heals. Your body heals. Your heart heals. The mind heals. Wounds heal. Your soul repairs itself. Your happiness is always going to come back. Bad times don’t last. It takes time to cleanse, to heal, to renew, to grow, to become. 

When it comes to healing, take all the time you need to heal emotionally. Moving on and forgetting about the past doesn’t take a day. Take your time. It takes a lot of little steps to be able to break free of your broken self.

220,"Hi, I appreciate if you’re willing to read this. I am a 21 year old college student. My pcp diagnosed me with PTSD and major depression last fall. She then referred me to a psychiatrist for adhd testing. I just got the results back and she said that the test results for adhd were inconclusive and she diagnosed me with ASPD, Major depressive disorder, and said that I had signs of being manic &amp; borderline. She also mentioned that I am showing signs of dissociation disorder. I honestly was sure what half of those even were and she referred me to a therapist. I then decided to google those things to get some clarity on my new diagnosis and read that ASPD is basically being a sociopath/psychopath. I don’t know how to feel right now and I’ve been sobbing for the past hour. 

I know I’m not normal but I didn’t think I’d get anything so bad and basically untreatable. I just don’t know if the diagnosis fits. Honestly I lie more often than I’d like to admit to get my way, and I’m definitely a risk taker. Sometimes I don’t feel anything, most of the time I don’t even really know who I am. But I cry,
I love my mom and sister, I have a couple best friends that I would do anything for. I care about their happiness and I care about their sadness. I cry often, I cry during sad movies, I cried when my dog died. I have violent thoughts sometimes but I don’t feel like they’re abnormal violent thoughts. When someone pisses me off at Walmart I think about how I’d like to throw punches but I don’t because I feel like I’m a nice person and I don’t really want to hurt anyone.

Will I be able to fall in love with someone? I’ve never really been in a serious relationship before but only due to past trauma preventing me from being comfortable with others.

so, i had a addiction (started as a sorta rebellious replacement to my hobby, what i then considered my passion, when i parents banned me from it to get me to focus only on school). after high school, was clean for 3-6 months (i have poor memory, i can easily remember events but i don't remember any details about them). was starting to recover. 

then, during first few months of college, i started very late for doing assignments. deadlines were so close and the stress got me relapsin' 

on and off, i tried to quit. relapsed very frequently.  at this point my self confidence was completely crushed. i give in to depression and despair. philosophy helped a lot in staying alive. not necessarily the ideas itself, but my newfound interest in the study of philosophy. (before 14 i used to be religious and liked to discuss about this  a lot with my friends, mostly of a different religion,  but philosophy is a much more sensible alternative for that part of me)

**relevant info**

now i'm relapsing less often and i am  hopeful about quitting this.

but, i don't remember what started it, but i started learning more and more about recent history,

world war 2, Holocaust (don't remember being taught the latter in my school, am from Myanmar). 

which then naturally led to me learning about post-war genocides and eventually the rohingya genocide. 

i was still doing fine up to now.

but then, when i learned that it is still ongoing, i thought my friends also don't know about it and that i need to spread the message to stop it.

 then realized everyone else knew about it. almost all of them didn't care. some, though very few, seem to  even support  it.  this was the beginning of my misanthropy. 

which then got me learning about the history of Myanmar, and it's ethnic groups. and more importantly, the post-coup era. learning about all the horrible ways military treated humans. 

**present**

now i'm a full-on misanthropist, i can't take it when i see people around me being happy or even just smiling. i see in them an evil who is indifferent to human suffering and doesn't care about others. 

but i' also feel deeply sad, every day, knowing that many. many millions are suffering. not just the rohingyas but also many in africa.

I have this weird thing where if I do not wake up at 7 every single day and workout and then do test prep and summer work I fall apart. Like i literally convince myself that because I did not follow my schedule that I am not worthy and lazy and a failure, so instead I spend the day with my room door locked extremely stressed and paralyzed, unable to get up and  get things done.

When I originally got with my girlfriend she seemed like she didn’t have a care in the world and that she was so confident and her life was going great, she was going to Florida the next week for a huge international competition owns her own dancing company at a really young age (teens) and was to be a part of insane things that were unfortunately cancelled due to the COVID-19 epidemic (which has also made things worse) but then she opened up to me after seeming down and she completely hates herself, every little bit she hates and there so much more going on that I don’t want to explain because it’s private to her. She’s been relying on me to stop her from genuinely committing suicide for nearly the whole 5 months we have been together. I really love her which is why it hurts me so much to see her like she is. I’ve tried everything and I’ve also made so many mistakes which I’m afraid has made things worse as I just don’t know how to really help and I’m getting so scared that she’s going to commit suicide and I won’t have truly helped her. The worst part is I promised her that I wouldn’t tell anyone and I don’t want to break her trust.",13Jul2020,1
232,"I'm at this point right now where I'm in physical pain from stuff I left too long, my car is fucked, my family is being insane and I broke my stupid phone.

235,"I'm 21F. At the beginning of the year, I was just fine. I was very happy and excited because I finally was going to transfer to university from community college after almost 4 years. I was excited to finally be on my own from my parents and finishing up my degree and just starting a new life in general during the new year and decade.

Then covid happened. When the state of Texas first shut down, I wasn't too bummed out. My job closed, and I could focus full time on finishing the spring semester strong and get back into old interest like drawing. But slowly I started feeling more down. The longer the lockdown lasted, the more sadder I got. I started to not feel any motivation to do anything anymore and all I started to do is sleep and eat all day. I've lost weight, but I feel a lot fatter than I am. Ans I can never be satisfied with the amount of sleep I get. I'm not over exaggerating when I say I'm always drowsy. Its like I can never get enough sleep. I got a car last month, but I was hardly excited, despite the fact that I've wanted a car since I was 16 I wasn't over the moon about it like I would've been if I gotten my car pre lockdown. When my job opened up again, I wasn't happy. Don't get me wrong, I like my job, but I started to not want to go anymore. I just wanted to stay in bed while doing homework. My mom said it's probably because I was moving in two months and didn't see the point. But I really needed the money, but not even money motivated me. 

After going back to work, my motivation feel even lower. I have a month until I can move in my apartment, but I'm hardly excited. I've tried to, but I just can't get into it. I don't want to work anymore and I started not wanting to take a shower or clean up. And I love showering and cleaning. But I've started to skip days on my day off. And I'm still always tired. Honestly, the best thing to come out of covid was getting a puppy. I love that little munchkin, he keeps me company and happy. My birthday is also in two months and I don't really care tbh, I'm still shook that we're almost halfway through July",13Jul2020,1

I’ve tried my hardest to not self harm and have been 12 days clean but today the urges and thoughts are so much in my head It’s distracting me a lot. I’m on here wanting to talk to someone because I’m afraid of what I might end up doing and relapsing.",13Jul2020,1
237,"2016-2017 was probably the worst year of my life. I moved to a new country with little to no emotional support as a teenager. My family was on the verge of destroying itself, I had no place to turn to for comfort as everyone I confided in was either gone or living in a bubble of their own misery.

During this time I learned how to cope with constant emotional pain. Not in a healthy way, though. My preoccupation with the problems in my life and adjusting to a completely new environment had made me fall back socially. I didn’t think I was interesting, good looking, or frankly worth any attention. I became the most introverted, anxious, and avoidant person I’ve ever known. 

With this, I got into bad eating, exercising, and social habits. I didn’t care for my well being anymore. When I finally had a self-care epiphany in 2018, it was not born out of a healthy mindset. Looking at all the beautiful, confident people on the streets and in social media made me feel like I deserved nothing and I was nothing until I stepped up to their level.

(For context, I have acne, slightly crooked teeth, a stutter, allergies, a morally dysfunctional family, and a deep inferiority complex.)  

Hence, I got into a really unhealthy habit of beating myself up mentally and physically for hours each day if I messed up. I did not allow myself to talk freely, to eat freely, to think freely, or to let go of anxiety. I completely forgot how to make special bonds with people. At this point, the only thing keeping me alive was the thought that this would all be over soon. 

And yes, this way of thinking actually reaped results for me. I started becoming fit, eating healthy, being grateful, and practicing self care, which I am still doing now. However, when grief or disappointment strikes (amplified by the lockdown right now), I revert back to my old ways of thinking. I do not allow myself to accept myself as I am, or to think that I’m worth anything unless I’m as perfect as I want to be.

I’m addicted to this way of thinking again. I cannot find a way to accept myself. Accepting myself feels like giving up, since I built my entire identity over the past few years on being the perfect human being to hide my pain and to completely stop my vulnerability. Even though I’m actively improving myself, I’m still hiding under the veil of desiring unattainable perfection. My only, sole goal is being unattainably perfect, and being the ideal person. 

How do I stop? Where do I go from here? How do I realize that I have inherent worth without feeling like I’m taking the easy route in life?",13Jul2020,1

241,"I really do not know how to start this, but I just wanna say that I really don’t know what is wrong with me because during the last 2 Years I just always feel so empty like I really don’t care if I would die right now. But I would not say that I am depressed because there are moments when I’m talking with some friends of mine where I feel kinda happy and also I really do not wanna be this cringey 16 Year old who diagnoses himself with some kind of depression. But on the other I use harming myself as a coping mechanism when I just feel like I can’t do all of this anymore, like when my family is just screaming at me for not being the perfect child like my sisters, and in moments like that I really do seriously consider to end it so that i can just escape out of my life. And I don’t really know what I can do to get help because I just don’t feel like I can talk with my parents about that kind of stuff because they’ll just say that I’m playing the victim. And if I’d go to someone for help I fear that my parents will know about it.

247,"(I'm sharing these because I have no one to go to and I don't know what to do.)

. . .

    I worry about all the memories I don’t remember. There are so many times where suddenly they come back to me and I feel a bit uneasy. Why did I not remember this until now? What if I just made this memory up in the moment? To be a victim– I don’t like the sudden memories and the ones I have that aren’t pleasant. How do I know if they’re real? My parents always told me that my memories are wrong because I’m just a kid who wants to make everything up; to be the victim. That terrifies now. If I can’t trust my own memories, who do I trust? I’m human just like everyone else, if I can manipulate my own memories, so can anyone else. So in a situation, who can I trust to hold the truth? You can’t trust anyone and that scares me. My parents made me not trust myself, but also not trust anyone else. 
    All these bad memories of my parents, my family, could all be wrong. The time my mom burned me, the time my father choked me, they could all be me over exaggerating a situation and I’ll never know if it's true. My family could be right that I’m pretending to be a victim for attention, but they could also be wrong, changing their own memories to make themselves feel better. There’s nothing I can do to prove anything, it’s all in the past.

. . .

    I have this feeling — this craving, the sort of craving that makes me want to pull at my flesh and drool. It springs at the back of my mind when I least expect it, trying to claw its way to overcome me. Everyday, I forcefully push it back and everyday it gets stronger. So strong, that I can no longer function until I satisfy it. I can feel my heart quicken to a deafening rate and my vision clouds with black specks that twist and turn. Someone, please help me. 
    It doesn’t matter how bad I know it is, it doesn’t matter how hard I try to ignore it. It will always overcome me in the end. I wish I could make progress, have a day where I don’t feel like I’m fighting to just have some semblance of normal. Because as much as I want to curl into a ball and scream until I go horse, I’ll fight it. On the outside, I put on a wide smile, but on the inside I’m curled into a ball screaming. How long can I keep this up?

. . .

    Why am I like this? There is a cloud over my head, a haze in my brain, something creeping at the back of my throat. There are moments where I want to shriek and beg for help. I want to grab my friend and pour out all my feelings; all the darkness I can no longer swallow. Yet, I don’t, I put on a grin and pretend to be the person they all know. I’m so exhausted. I wonder if I’m depressed, that there’s something I can do to fix me, but I don’t want to admit it. 
    Admitting it would mean that I am weak. I am a man, I cannot be weak. The [censored] family does not have problems. Admitting it would mean I may not be able to fix it even if I do. I look at those around me, those who say they have depression and I think, well I’m not that bad, I can handle mine. So obviously I have to continue like this until I break  — until breathing becomes too unbearable. Sometimes I just wish I could stop breathing. 

. . .

    I’m sitting in my friend's kitchen, enjoying a cream soda as we laugh and they make dinner. Everything seems fine, my mind is focused on our conversation where I don’t feel the haze. I tip my bottle to my lips and am about to take a swig as they talk, when they pull out a kitchen knife to cut the vegetables. For a moment, I freeze, the bottle poised at my lips. I gaze at that blade as it glints against the fluorescent lights between each chop. My vision sparks and I see my wrist soaked in blood. I can feel my legs tingle.
    My friend asks me a question that brings me back to the present. The blood disappears as I reply, but I can still feel my thighs tingle and I begin the scratch at the area. What is wrong with me? I have to hold myself back from taking that knife out of their hands. I need to do better. This used to never happen. Something is wrong with me. I try to act like everything is fine, but I can still feel the sting. 

. . .

    The world seems so distant and foreign, like I’m watching my life through a tv with bad reception. Sounds are muffled against my ears and my visions seem clouding with flecks of black. I could spend hours upon hours staring at nothing in this state. Nothing feels real and my limbs seem to be orchestrated by strings. It’s not safe to stay here, but it’s too hard to fight. Even if I feel I’m out, I am pulled right back in within minutes. The world is out of focus and foreign,  and I live here. 

. . .

Dreams of death seem foreboding, like a coming storm. Vivid and realistic so much so  you almost wonder if your surroundings that you wake up to are hell. I wonder if I should ignore it, they’re dreams after all, yet they leave me unnerved. Dreams are also a product of your mind. My mind screams for my death. I had hoped these thoughts would go away, yet they linger even in my dreams. How many times am I going to wake up shaking and gasping for air?
At night I die and in the day I feel a heavy weight over my shoulders. I’m so tired of this. I’m so tired of feeling anxious for no reason and feeling this gloom. It’s so painful to put on an appearance of happiness, but when you’re alone all those things come crashing down. You can put them off, but not run away. 

. . .

I’m dazed and lost. My heart hurts. I don’t want to feel this anymore. 

. . .

I don’t feel connected to myself. I know I am an entity within this body, but I can’t pin where it’s coming from. If I focus on my body, it doesn’t feel like my own. It has parts that confuse and distress me. This feels so foreign. Why is it like that? If I try to focus within my mind, it feels so strange. The thoughts and the way it works doesn’t feel like my own, as if I am within some strange world.
I don’t understand  how it works or why it works the way it does. Everything seems so bizarre. Sometimes I feel like I over analyze until I’m lost — why do humans have emotions? Why do we seem to have so many problems? Everything is so foreign as I look at it through this glass.

. . .

There are moments where I feel the fog over my mind dissipate. I don’t realize there is a fog there until it’s gone, then suddenly everything feels so clear. I wish it would be like that all the time. The weird haze I’m always in is suffocating at times— 

. . .

I’m so fucking scared of losing my mind. I see a lot of people who have anxiety and they’re just crumbling. My mother, my best friend, strangers. Their brains just aren’t there anymore. I don’t want to be like them. I’m so fucking scare. Whether they get treatment or go undiagnosed, they lose it, anxiety just destroys everything they had. Am I going to end up like that? I already feel it. Aside from my fear of all my memories being false, they all feel so hazy. I barely remember high school. I get overwhelmed so easily and I just remember nothing. I get overtaken just by one thing and boom, nothing else. It’s like tunnel vision, but almost all the time. And when I notice, I panic, and that makes it worse. I can barely function as a human when I panic. What do I do? I don’t want to be like this all the time. My parents already tell me that I’m making this all up. I’m a grown ass adult and I let them infect me still. I could never get therapy, they would never let it go. And if I did, I would turn out like my friend. If I refuse, I’ll be my mother. I’m screwed, I’m so screwed. It’s not fair why does my brain have to be like this?

. . .

    I wish I wasn’t a burden, or at least I didn’t feel that way. I can’t believe I let that happen – I can’t believe I did that on purpose. I did it on purpose. I mean, I didn’t mean to, but I did. God. Why is my every thought, my every move, a contradiction? Why am I like this? Why can’t I be better? Why do I have to doubt my every thought?  
    I let [censored] see it again. Again like it was on purpose. I’m such a piece of shit. I deserve to die. I desperately want to be seen, to have someone help me, that I must be just purposely doing this. So, in turn, I am a burden to my friends. I even thought I had it together. I thought that [censored] wouldn’t hear or see me as my brain fucking melted. Melted into my tingling fingers and my gasps for air. I was getting it together and as I put my guard down, suddenly I couldn’t breath. Suddenly I couldn’t move my hands. The best I could was curl into a ball, not even aware of my breathing.
    I must have woken them up. I can’t even remember. For a second, as I crumbled, I lost my awareness. I don’t know what my body was doing. I’m so sorry, we were supposed to be having a good time, but instead you saw the lines on my arms and panics. Fuck. I’m so sorry. I was doing so well, I was watching how I was breathing, making sure it didn’t go too far. How did that second wave happen? Why did I forget how to breathe? The only thing that brought me back was your voice, as you called my name. My heart jumped, I could hear you through my headphones, but all I could do was feel regret. Fuck. Fuck. No. 
    Clearly, I was faking it, to get your attention. I’ve always been an attention seeker. Of course I can pull it together when you sit down next to me and gently rub my arm. Oh, of course. Almost within a few minutes, my fingers started to move a little more. I was still dizzy, but that was probably from my idiot brain hyperventilating. When you helped me up and took me back to the bed, I felt so stupid, like a baby. A worthless burden that drags you down. I’m so sorry, I won’t let it happen again.",13Jul2020,1

256,"Hi!

This is my first time posting here. A quick disclaimer: i’m not a native english speaker so i’m sorry for my grammar mistakes in advance.

I have a question on a feeling i’ve been having rather my entire life. I’m a 17 year old girl, so maybe this feeling is going to fade over the years. But i’ve always wondered why it hasn’t faded yet. And if anyone knows a name for this feeling? 

It’s such a weird thing to describe, as a kid i would always just call it ‘homesick’ and i think it was that back in the days honestly, but everytime i’m traveling or going away for a few days i tend to have this very empty feeling on the day before and the day i go. I would describe it as a mixture of homesick, sentimental bullshit and very high or very low expectations. I think it’s mainly overthinking EVERYTHING as i always do though, so it might be just that. But i don’t know how to turn it off. 

The day i arrive at my hotel or whatever i just have the urge to go home and go back to my safe habits and my safe place. I just want to go HOME. But literally the morning after all of that is gone. I still feel a bit down but i feel okay. The entire homesick, empty feeling is gone. And i have this feeling everytime i go on a trip.

Anyways, right now i’m going on a trip and i feel the exact same way, but i wouldn’t describe it as being nervous. I don’t know, it’s a weird feeling. Does anyone recognize this feeling or know what it’s called ??

I’m sorry for this long confusing story lmao, i just had to get this off my chest and i really wanted to know if anyone ever feels like this. Thank you for reading this!",13Jul2020,1

I'm terrified that this will continue to hurt my friendships. I don't know if it has to do with my father being emotionally and mentally abusive and my parents splitting, but it needs to stop. I'm almost 20, for God's sake! 

Anyone else suffer from something similar to this?",13Jul2020,1
269,"hello, i am F(20) and have been diagnosed with MDD and severe anxiety. a few months ago, i started researching autism in females and i do light research on it everyday. 
the thing is, to the eye i ""look"" neurotypical. people have told me they see me as confident, smart, funny, etc... but i cannot say the same about myself. 
ever since i realized that most of my behavior was seen as ""weird"", i've observed people intensely to mimic their behavior so that i can seem normal.
i've always had special interests that pretty much take up my entire life.
it's hard for me to sense social cues and sarcasm. it's also difficult for me to know if i'm being manipulated--and for this reason, it's always been really hard for me to have my own opinions (although i'm getting better at thinking for myself).
i try to be empathetic but it can be really hard for me to see from other peoples' perspectives sometimes.
lately, (idk if i've become self-aware or what) i've had crippling paranoia. lately it's been EXTREMELY hard to pick up the energy of a room. it's been extremely hard to know if i'm being manipulated or lied to. i hate this feeling. 
i've also figured out that my random head-jerks are tics. they used to be mild, but ever since i've realized what they were, they've been more frequent. every once in a while i'll have vocal tics too, but they're not as frequent as motor tics.
until i get diagnosed i'm going to be constantly wondering whether my feelings are valid or if my body is just making them up as a means of some hypochondriac disorder. i feel like im going crazy. please, if anyone can relate to me or help me, it would be greatly appreciated.
*side note, ive stayed at a mental hospital before for my depression but realized DURING my stay that my dad had previously kicked me off the health insurance without telling my mom.
so i have no health insurance, i can feel my autonomy slowly leaving my body and i have no idea what to do with my life. please help.",13Jul2020,1
270,"Did you parents guide you? When I ask for help they tell me they don’t know how to help me... then they yell at me to go get a job. I’m so old at 24. My job isn’t paying well and I don’t know what to do. I tried a career counselor who didn’t help. My parents keep asking me what will I do if I am no where and don’t know how to help. Then I said umm yeah I’m asking you that. I am saying I need help and I’m having a ton of anxiety. I have so many bills and no idea how I’m going to pay for things. I have a degree in design but I don’t have a proper portfolio and have to revise it. I don’t know how. I just chose it but I still don’t know if I even want to be a designer. 

I feel like such a failure and I’m going to never be successful. Are parents suppose to help? I mean I am embarrassed to ask them for help. They always tell me that I’m an adult and I need to stop blaming them for things and figure it out. So so much anxiety again omg omg 😭I want a change and I don’t know where to begin. Like what do I focus on? I’m all over the place. What do I focus on tomorrow? I wish I had a mentor. I don’t know anyone and I have no money to offer to ask for help. My insurance is no longer paying for stuff too. I feel so sick to my stomach that I got into a fight with my parents. I can’t have a normal conversation with my parents. I don’t know how to move out too. I’m going to be homeless.",13Jul2020,1
271,"

Idk what to do any more if I’m honest. It’s been pretty sad and meaningless lately. I’m scared to do it but nothing in my life is distracting me and comforting me, and making me feel happy. I’ve been trying so hard to feel happy but I can’t. I really can’t. Every night, I shiver and my leg starts shaking and I get really anxious. I’m just done. I’m not going to give you a sob story on the whole of my life because you probably don’t care and you shouldn’t. You don’t owe me anything. No one does. So I should just give up really. It’s pretty common but now, it’s worse then ever. Sometimes I think about suicide but I’m too pussy to do it.",13Jul2020,1
272,"Last time I posted on reddit about my true feelings asking for someone to talk to, I got the police called on me and I had to spend a month in mental hospital hell. I just want someone to vent to without being reported to the fucking authorities",13Jul2020,1
273,"So some context:

My step brother lost his dad when he was 11. My mum gave him 50k and moved down south leaving him to live on his own at the age of 19. Anyway he fell in to a culture of drinking drugs etc but never too Severe. 

Right now he’s split up with his ex wife. She’s pushing his buttons a little but overall she’s concerned for him and treating him ok. Problem with my brother is he will push everyone away, if you accuse him of drinking or doing something wrong he’ll not be able to talk about it and give a volley of abuse and shut the conversation down. 

Anyway he had a women over and his little daughter saw him in bed with her. His 6 year old told his ex wife(her mum) and so she now wants to restrict overnight access for a short while. My brother is hurling abuse at her and saying he’ll kill her if she doesn’t let him see his daughter. 

The question is what can be done about my brother? He knows he has a mental illness, but What kind of councillor would be skilled enough to deal with him/change him? 

Hes one of the funniest and most intelligent people I know but at the same time he always seeks approval, can say horrible stuff, he’s never actually been physically abusive and I’m sure the threat is empty/drunk based plus they live apart. his problems are so deep rooted. I think that he may have “abandoned chip syndrome” or something like that, he has a lot of anxiety and is currently in debt. Don’t know if reddit is the place to look for help. He’s receiving counselling at the moment but I don’t know if a run of the mill councillor will be able to help. 

Just looking to get help as right now he can still turn things around. In a few weeks I don’t think that’ll be the case and I don’t want the police to have to get involved.",13Jul2020,1
274,"I’ve gone to the ER several times in the past week for suicidal thoughts, but every time they’ve treated my like shit &amp; sent me home (COVID so no beds apparently). I really, really feel like I need to stay inpatient because I feel like I’m gonna hurt myself, but getting sent home every time is discouraging. My city also doesn’t have a psych hospital so the ER psych ward is the only option for me.

277,"I told my therapist that I have these “notes” I keep on my phone when I die, and she inferred them as suicidal notes (which they could be taken as I guess..). I also told her I have passing thoughts of killing myself, just normal things like “oh I wonder what would happen if I jumped of this building— is it tall enough to kill me?” and normal things like that. 

I am not suicidal, I am too stubborn to die now. I have no plan and I am not actively going to kill myself. 

My therapist is going to tell my parents about the notes and thoughts tomorrow due to the fact I will be going on holiday for three weeks, and I will not have access to any helplines and therapy. 

I’m so fucking scared. It’s 1am and I feel like I’m waiting on execution row. I’m terrified of all the ways this will change my family dynamic. I’m a fuckin cocktail of guilt, terror, shame and fear. I don’t want my parent to know; one of my conditions with my psychiatrist was that everything stays private. I like to deal with things alone, and my doctor is someone who doesn’t have an affiliation with me personally, so she’s ok, but my parents are a different story. It’s going to open the floodgates and I feel like shit. 

Funny how the way they consider it “helping” is the very thing triggering the hell outta me.

278,"Depression is different for everyone that struggles with it. It comes in many forms, some more severe than others. You can have good days and bad days. And for some people, depression simply doesn’t “just go away” 

Depression can feel like “I want to talk to someone but I don’t have anyone to talk to.” It can feel like you’re sad, but there’s no reason. It can feel like you’re alone in the world and no one understands you. Just because you’re not suicidal, doesn’t mean you are any less valid. 

Fortunately, my depression isn’t severe. I don’t have to take anti depressants. But that doesn’t mean I don’t struggle with it. And I’m aware that there are people like me. We may not be suicidal, but any support we get we still appreciate. Literally any kind of positive comment can help brighten someone’s day. 

Basically, just because you aren’t suicidal, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get help. Don’t be afraid to seek help just because you feel like “well my depression isn’t that bad. Other people have it worse.” I used to be in that mindset and it’s NOT healthy. If you feel like you need help, it’s ok to talk to someone even if “it’s not that bad.” EVERYONE has the right to seek help!

Another example is I always thought I was good at writing so I tried making a book but it's been months since I even looked at it. There are many more examples but it's too many to list. I began suffering from anxiety and I began cutting but I try not to talk about it because I'm just a burden. Seriously who will ever love a stupid fuck up who can't do anything good no matter how hard they tried and on top of it I have all that emotional baggage no one would ever want to be near me and that's why people don't talk to me and call me annoying.

282,"I am dealing with depression, anxiety, dissociation, ADHD, and a somatic disorder, for reasons related to coronavirus I will not be able to return to therapy until September, and I will have to resist until then. Most of my ways of coping are unhealthy, such as drinking alcohol excessively, overeating, sleeping excessively, self-harming, self-isolating, and even hurting other people, and when I do any of those things I feel awfully bad afterwards and I end up in an infinite loop of harmful coping mechanisms, and the only thing that gets me out of that loop is sex.

Unfortunately, depression often lowers my libido and there are days when I am too lazy to have sex, despite having the cutest boyfriend in earth and some friends with benefits with whom to have safe sex, but precisely because I love them and my family so much I need to make sure I last through September, so I need to raise my libido as much as I can to avoid other dangerous ways of coping.",13Jul2020,1
283,"There is so much guilt and stress associated with eating for me that more often than not, not eating is just easier. It's awful how an ED takes over your life and you almost start to embody it. It starts to show in how you look and how you talk. Actually it becomes the only thing you can talk about. You can't hold an interesting conversation anymore. You can't focus for more than 5 minutes. You can't talk about your interests. You can't have fun like you used to. You can't just accept snacks from other people. You will never see your body the same way ever again. Life becomes all about numbers, figures, weight, and fading away. 'How long till I lose 10 more lbs?' is actually 'how long till I fade more and more?' 'how long till I am 10lbs closer to death?'

I thought antidepressants were supposed to decrease your libido but I've been noticing way less sexual arousal and such. The smaller the dosage the less I have sexual thoughts and motivation to have sex. Is this normal? Or maybe it's just a coincidence that I've been feeling like this right now and that it's not directly related to the medicine.

287,"This is probly not the right sub but I don’t know where I would post this.... basically, a childhood friend of mine completely lost his mind on me out of the blue last night and started screaming at me, accusing me of things that are really far fetched. Im a small woman and he is a built man and he just kept screaming at me at the top of his lungs. At one point he was screaming that he hates me and all this stuff and I got scared and started crying because I thought he might hurt me and he just kept screaming at me.... I’ve never experienced anything close to this with him and he seemed to be having some kind of mental health or substance related problems... 

Eventually I literally ran away because I was afraid of him and he texted and called me non stop throughout the night to continue yelling at me. I didn’t engage in any of this; it couldn’t even be considered an argument because I literally never said a word back because I was so taken aback.

So now, today, I’m feeling super scared... I’ve had past traumas with men and for some reason I feel like this guy is going to find me and hurt me. He knows where I live and I live alone.... I don’t know what to do. Maybe I’m just being paranoid but I’m terrified",13Jul2020,1
