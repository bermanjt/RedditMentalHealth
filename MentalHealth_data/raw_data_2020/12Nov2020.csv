0,"the place i’m in right now, it’s weird. i am diagnosed from anxiety and depression although i feel like it may be deeper than that.

like i know i’m depressed but like the kind that seems okay to everyone and just had slumps but i’m not where i used to be with the self harm and suicidal thoughts, so that doesn’t really worry me anymore tbh.

now it’s kinda the fact that i just don’t care about anything anymore, i’m not really sad but i’m definitely not happy either.  i’ve cut contact with people i’ve been friends with for years and i’m constantly like i’m about to burst.  

i’m almost 18 and i have suffered with mental health since i was about 13, since i’ve kicked the drugs i’m not really depressed anymore i’m just very empty and keep to myself.

my rage is scary and that’s what i’m worried for, it’s like someone could do the smallest thing and i’m not sure if this is normal lol but when i’m about to have an outburst i get a big time adrenaline rush and it means i’m out of control and it scares me a lot because i know i could do anything and not even think about the consequences in that time 

i was seeing a therapist but it might be because i’m not an adult yet, i’ll just be honest i respect her for what she does but for it was shit.. no help whatsoever, just giving me techniques to calm down.

i’m sorry for whoever reads this, i’m not expecting replies i’m just glad i have somewhere to get this off my chest. although i’d be grateful if someone knew what was going on w me and what it is i’m suffering",12Nov2020,1
1,"So im a 20 year old male and im not sure what to do anymore

I dont feel like i have any real friends, never had a girlfriend because i have no sense of confidence and is somewhat paranoid because of situation with former friendgroups when i was younger.

 I have been clinically diagnosed with anxiety,depression, adhd, asthma, low pain tolerance, autism and now CFS (chronic fatigue syndrom).

I cant really go out and do activities because of my CFS and i cant get any new friends because of the combination of my autism, paranoia and anxiety

My only real safe space was videogames but now the entire industry is going to shit. I just dont know what to do, i cant do anything and nothing is fun anymore and im building up more and more anger at existance itself and  getting more and more violent impulses towards everything

And this isnt even getting better with time, the opposite actually, my anger and anxiety is becoming worse and worse by the day and seeing what is happening with the world and society. Without my parents i would probably already have killed myself and i dont know if i could survive if either of them died.

Its not fair, i also want to be able to do things and have fun",12Nov2020,1
2,"Help (very brief suicidal ideation warning**)

I am currently 17 years of age, and have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and severe generalized anxiety, as of recent.

Two years ago I had believed myself to be capable of achieving what Einstein had done, despite being terrible at mathematics. I was genuinely convinced that I had within myself the potential to be a mathematical genius, yet I was receiving Fs.

During this time I had grown extremely confident in my abilities, and my friends at the time (though I would not put too much value on their judgment) proclaimed me as being very arrogant. I felt incredible. Sometimes I just bounced and smiled with joy, which is definitely not native to my personality.

Then there are times when I am so depressed that I cannot focus in class or care enough to even attend. This is a recent development; I have never skipped classes until now. I currently have all Fs, which has also never happened until now. I have also eyed my medications with lust before, wanting to down them all as quickly as I could, right then and there.

The thing is, I don’t have outbursts. I am EXTREMELY disciplined (high-functioning, I suppose) and though I may seem calm there have been many, many times that I nearly threw a chrome book across the room in fury because the students wouldn’t be quiet, and times that I was so damn irritated that I was positively shaking. But I never ‘explode’. I’m always on the border. I believe this is why my psychiatrist scratched out bipolar from the list, because I don’t go observably ‘mad’.

Should I be concerned? Have any of you been diagnosed with major depression/anxiety prior to a bipolar diagnosis?",12Nov2020,1
3,"OK, there’s so much going on this is going to be hard to get out, but I’ll try.

I’m almost 25, working a very unskilled low paying job, live with my parents (duh), have no friends, started community college but haven’t continued since finishing the first semester online because of C ovid, never had a girlfriend, never had sex or even kissed, and don’t have a driver license. Also I can’t even respect myself, I can’t be defiant or steve up for myself without consequences (like being fired) so I can not even respect myself.

I have OCD, which flares up when stressed. Like lengthy washing, things like that. (I worry if I had a girlfriend and we lived together, she’d get sick of it and leave me, a girl on Whisper even said that her OCD boyfriend is worse than her ABUSIVE ex-boyfriend).

I also worry that I may never be able to have an emotional connection with anyone, due to being bullied my whole school life, and isolated for years after. Been told how ugly I am by many online too. People say you have to do certain things, COMPETE to WIN women. That’s so off-putting to me, relationships are supposed to form naturally from people just connecting, not being something you have to jump through a ton of hoops and be THE BEST to win.

I had a few LDRs, one IRL female friend who tried to get me to have sex with her (but I was a scared idiot) so maybe all hope isn’t lost???

Still, I have so many other problems, and at this point my mind is SO MESSY, SO MANY DISTURBING THOUGHTS AND BELIEFS have just been collecting and sitting in my mind, I don’t know how my mind could possibly be cleared. I struggle to even communicate everything now, my mind is just so disorganized now......

I can accept that i was a total loser who no girl would even hold hands with my whole school life, but getting told I’m so ugly by so many online too? Maybe some find me attractive, or at least care about more than my looks, but how will I ever find them? I need to be financially independent, and definitely at least mentally stable.

I’m at a point where any criticism can trigger panic attacks (like if it’s something that could mean getting fired), feelings of complete worthlessness, rage, crying. Cue trolls calling me a snowflake, whatever, I’m sick of feeling this way and missing something out on life.

It’s easier (but of course miserable) to just keep to myself, so I won’t have to risk any disagreements, conflict, rejection, making fun of me. I know, being THIS scared of what could go wrong guaranteed I won’t get to enjoy anything good, I wish I could COMPETENTLY take risks.

I’ve been taking two medications for 9 years now, Sertraline (Zoloft) 200 MG a day and Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) 600 MG TWICE a day (1,200 MG daily total).

This January I started Bupropion SR (Wellbutrin) at 100 MG for my uncontrollable rage outbursts. Doctor doubled the dose, I experienced worse anxiety and completely lost my libido, couldn’t feel my penis, and felt no pleasure from orgasm. 

A couple weeks after going back to 100 MG of Wellbutrin, I recovered that. Strangely, a few months later, I experienced A MINDBLOWING POWERFUL orgasm, and they’ve always felt underwhelming (usually still good though) my entire life, I had two of those, but since fluctuate between pretty pleasurable, kind of pleasurable, and sometimes not much feeling.

Why do I care? Well, it does feel good to do even to myself. But also I REALLY want to experience romantic and sexual relationships with women one day. I would highly prefer if this could happen while I’m still in my 20s, but I have so much catching up to do and still not finding a way to start. I learned about PSSD (Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction) as well as emotional, cognitive, and mental dysfunctions, that can persist OR newly appear upon tapering and discontinuing. These dysfunctions can last INDEFINITELY, with no cures known, as so few people report these conditions, so not much research goes into it. Most doctors refuse to believe this, they all claim that side effects DEFINITELY go away shortly after getting off the pills, WRONG, especially after such long-term use.....

Need to get out of my parents house, away from bullshit, and just to be on my own, then I’ll feel more comfortable trying more things, like dating women and having sex. Obviously I STILL need other issues resolved....

I recently started looking into buying and reselling shoes (maybe other things too) as it turns out to be a big niche market, a coworker told me about it. I purchased an ebook from a bigtime seller (just $50) but failed to commit to reading everyday. Reading is difficult for me these days, and it’s almost 400 pages.

I’m thinking maybe I should just try it out (even if I don’t read the entire thing) and maybe I should continue school (I’m too worried about missing out on the rest of my life to worry about catching c ovid, I’m at high risk of catching it at work anyway, many people have but so far I somehow haven’t, not that I know of, at least.

All the talk about degrees being worthless discourage me though, not even considering the fact that I don’t know how to socialize when I was going.

But NOTHING is guaranteed in life, even if you work REALLY hard, at least that’s how it works in capitalist societies. But I have ridiculous procrastination issues, I get overwhelmed with how much I have to do, and just end up doing nothing, laying on my bed thinking.

I’m probably forgetting something because there’s so much that my brain is unorganized and I can’t remember everything right now, that’s all I can get out right now.",12Nov2020,1
4,"tw: depression, anxiety, self-harm, suicidal thoughts

so i’ve been suffering from depression and anxiety for a little under 10 years now and for the most part i’ve been suffering in silence. my family knows to a certain extent that everyday is pretty much difficult for me but they truly fail to get how hard my days are. not to mention they make everything abt them. 

recently, my mental health has been really bad and i’ve been going thru what i believe to be psychosis. it’s been scaring me a lot and absolutely stressing me out bc of the constant suicide and self harm thoughts. i haven’t told my family abt it bc they are the type to call me crazy (they constantly do it) and really just throw it in my face whenever they can but i did have a slip up one morning. 

what happened was that i woke up at 5 am and at some point i didn’t feel like me and i wasn’t controlling my actions so i texted in our family gc that i feel like they hate me and i’ll be sure to stay far away from them. i fell asleep shortly after and when i woke up there were a bunch of calls and texts messages of them declaring their love and basically wondering how could i say that. the thing is after reading those messages i still didn’t feel the so call love from them. later when i went home i was forced into hugs and also given food (my mom’s favorite way to show her love) but it all felt like a performance. my mom still called me crazy and my sister still made my own problems and sufferings abt her. 

honestly, i’m so tired and fed up. i’m tired of them and also tired of being mentally ill. i do have a therapist and my fiancée is a great support system but i can’t help feeling like there’s really no point anymore. like i’m so unbelievably tired :/",12Nov2020,1
5,"Since I was a kid, I've had some sorts of reflexes like doing a muscle movement in a pair number, like blinking a single eye twice, doing some sort of muscle rotation within my legs (right upper leg then right lower leg then left lower leg then left upper leg if you get me).

For a while I also had that head shaking thing like a really fast upper to lower head shake movement that I did all day long.

The muscle contractions I currently have a lot are in my arms and in my neck and a lip to nose sort of movement.

7,"Ever since the start of all the Covid restrictions, my work has gone crazy. I work in an essential industry and our sales are up 50% over 2019, which was our busiest year at that point. The work load has no sign of letting up and it just keeps getting more and more. Even prior to this, my depression and anxiety were really riding me. Couple that with the overworked exhaustion, I’ve been having a rough year. I’m so wiped out that I don’t have any desire to do any of my hobbies other than cooking dinner. I’m taking an SSRI now and it’s helping, but I just feel like a guitar string that someone won’t stop tuning up. More and more tension all the time and I’m eventually going to snap.

8,"I've been feeling really weak, today especially. I should be living in an apartment with my boyfriend right now, but then COVID hit right when he moved to my state in March and we live in different towns right now trying to save up for the shitty economy we are in. But he then got let go without notice from his first job here because they brought back all of their older employees on leave for COVID. He got another job at minimum wage after weeks of tireless searching. I faced daily harassment at my work until I finally gave up and quit. I hope to have a job by next week but who knows right now. 

Apartments are absolutely unaffordable and even the ones in our price range expect to see wages from the previous two weeks that can cover three times the price of rent. That's ABSOLUTELY UNREASONABLE! My credit score means nothing to most places if we can't afford three times the rent with two weeks of pay. Needless to say I'm a fucking college student in their 20's living in their parents basement. I'm that cliche now. Last summer I had a full time job with the city and could afford school without a loan and now I have to ask for extra support from my family which feels awful. I was furloughed this year from the city, leading me to shitty minimum wage jobs. I'll graduate with a bachelors next year and I'm still living like a high schooler. I feel pathetic. 

COVID cases are on an extreme spike right now to make matters worse. Because we don't live together and I'm a high risk individual, my boyfriend and I no longer can really see each other until my town releases its stay-at-home mandate for the third fucking time. 

And even WORSE, my dad has just been told he has high blood pressure and could get diabetes easily if he continues eating the way he does, AND my uncle was just diagnosed with stage three prostate cancer. His father had died from the same cancer a few years ago. Everything has gone to shit and I've laid in bed all day on-and-off crying, I haven't eaten or had water. The best part of my day was that my cat hasn't left my side. It's uncharacteristic of him so I'm sure he knows I'm upset. I have assignments due and I can't bring myself to even look at them. I want to get out of bed only to turn my lights back off because they're bright and irritating. 

I don't know what to do. I'm scared and frustrated and angry, my anxiety and depression are at an all time high, and my motivation is nearly nonexistent. I have no life anymore, I barely talk to friends, my boyfriend was my last external link to my life and now that's being suppressed because people can't get their shit together and help lower the spread of the fucking virus. I need support but I don't even know what anyone can do at this point.",12Nov2020,1
9,"Almost a year ago, I got health problem, i was moved to the new city, and covid started  i was totally alone and doctors were not very helpful, (they just wanted money, and after paying thousands they told me idk).... i was devastated, and all my dreams and future perspective started to fade because all i could do was to worry about my issue and blame myself that it happened.

After a while i started to change my perspecrive  and  i started to stick onetthought: what ever, i as everyone else will die after a while and no of those will matter... 
Surprisingly for me it helped me to overcome worryness, i adapted to my issue and continued  live with it.

But scary part started after that, that thought that nothing really matters engraved in my mind so deeply that i started to question everything around me... god, life, death, whats important in life whats not... it started to drive me to dark places like: qhats the point of living, nothing matters, even if i do something enormous and stay in history whats the point, it just won't matter... I'm so jelous of poeple who believe in after life, in religion, in country in ideology... i think i cant believe in  anything... because of that i dont belong to any system, any place, i feel super lonely as an individual... I tried to believe in things like: make things to make some elses lives better, to make better world to live... i am trying to get excited by things to learn and to create something but at the end motivation or any excitment  any good feeling is canceled with: what ever, nothing matters anyway... we will all die...

Strange thing is i noticed people mostly afraid of death, and to be honest I'm very looking forward for it, like I'm super interested whats after it... it feels wrong sometimes.. i afraid of getting tortured before death, like i got this health issue, that was the worst part that it might be with me always... As my childhood was full of humiliation, disappointment and despair i did  so much hard work to change my life and here i encounter covid, healrh issues stress and loneliness, i felt very unfair... plus guilt

I dont know what to do, what to think about... I'm doing therapy, but this part is still here, deeply in my mind that nothing matters anyway... i just need to have consistent belief in something, how how can i do that....

I feel very low.

13,"I(23F) live in Canada.
I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and feel like I was misdiagnosed. I quit my meds(lithium) in March and didn’t get a follow up appointment with the psychiatrist.
As the time went on I noticed I don’t really have any true manic episodes and when I’m depressed it’s usually about my inability to reach goals.

I also have an eating disorder and might have substance abuse in my mental health file. I have had my diagnoses change over the years since I was seven.
I’ve been misdiagnosed so many times now that I’m sure this is what it is I’m scared of being misdiagnosed, told I’m bipolar and delusional, or accused of wanting to abuse stimulants given my impulsive history and the eating disorder.
I’m scared of lithium weight gain because I’m fatter than I ever was before.

I wrote down 2 pages of info on why I think I have ADHD but left some stuff like how I was in school as a kid out, I imagine they will ask me?
Should I mention that I’ve taken ephedrine to self medicate with my mental health issues or would that be seen as me just trying to get stimulants?

I just want to be taken seriously, if I really just wanted to abuse stimulants I could just talk to the crackhead in my apartment building. I’m not desperate enough to get high that I would want to be the reason someone who has ADHD can’t get their meds. Unfortunately after I’ve educated myself a bit on adhd I might be the one having that happen to me.
I’ve gone off my lithium at least 4 times when it didn’t help and just made me feel sick and taking it again when I was getting suicidal. 
My family is so dismissive of me and I have an ADHD step sibling he is a teen boy, I am an adult woman. I have always avoided interacting with my family.
They think I’m just bipolar. 

I’ve been crying for the last few days because I don’t fit the stereotypical ADHD hyper loud thing people think of, so I don’t know if I’ll even be taken seriously. I’m anxious, angry and get depressed a lot.

I work during my clinic opening and phone hours, I hate leaving messages because I don’t know what to say. I don’t want to explain that I’m seeking an ADHD diagnosis within earshot of my coworkers but I might have to.

I lost all of my social skills. I've never really had social anxiety when talking to people and I've always been really outgoing.

I've been diagnosed with mild clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder, I think there's more than just that but I haven't been able to get a psych examination recently. I'm not currently on any meds or going to therapy or counselling, either, but that's not relevant to my question.

I've dealt with several difficult times in my life for the past few years, but one thing I realized is that I'm usually able to control how I feel. For example, if I'm starting to break down, I can make myself stop if I focus on how I'm feeling. If I'm starting to cry, I can stop crying. If I begin to feel angry, I can make myself stop feeling that way. If I'm feeling overwhelmed, I can make myself numb. It's never a situation where it takes 15-30+ minutes to calm down, it's almost immediate. It happens very quickly.  I noticed that it's been an immediate response to my feelings recently, but I don't know if it's normal. The only way I really know how to describe it is, ""masking,"" my feelings, but 1. I don't know if that term is okay to use for things like depression and anxiety, and 2. I think it's similar, but a little different. I don't know.",12Nov2020,1

I feel like I might have some kind of mental illness but I don't it feels like nothing can be used to describe what I'm feeling. I've been informing my self during this quarantine about mental illnesses in an attempt to find what was going on inside me, to have some kind of idea but it looks like I'm just okay
Yet again I feel far from okay. Since around the beginning of this year I've had some suicidal thoughts and they've grown more frequent over time. I thought I had depression for  long time but self diagnosis is really not it plus, I feel ""fine""",12Nov2020,1
27,"
Well here I am 21 years old with no friends and I’ve never been in a serious relationship. Thought college would turn my life around. I live 8 hours away from my family. I go whole days without talking to people. Good grades, an enjoyable job, and this is what I have to show for it? My friends from highschool stopped caring about me years ago. So busy with my schoolwork freshman year they stopped asking me to do things even when I’m home. Dated a girl once back in highschool. Broke up with me because I was “too nice” (wouldn’t have sex with her right away). Joined clubs and went to social events, but I don’t drink often or smoke at all so I couldn’t find any other guys in the same boat. Been on hundreds of dates and they’ve never gone anywhere. “You’re so nice, anyone would be so fortunate to have you. You’re the sweetest guy in the world. You’re at least a 6/10 dont beat yourself up over it”.... left on read, left on delivered, ignored. Given up on women. Haven’t talked to one in years. This is it I guess. All I have are the people in the same boat as me on the internet to vent to. Don’t know how much more of this I can take. Nothing gives me pleasure anymore. I just sit in my room in the darkness doing homework and then bed. Rinse and repeat. “Lower your standards, or else you’ll be lonely forever”. My standards are high, not ridiculously though. I’d rather be lonely than be with someone I’m not happy with. “Just don’t focus on getting a girlfriend and one will come to you”. Well. I’ve been waiting for 7 years. “We‘ll come over and do something for your birthday!... oh sorry, didn’t work out we can’t make it”. Another birthday alone with no wishes. I don’t even know what I’m asking advice for. I guess is it over? Am I just gonna be the weird creepy guy who kills himself in 10 years, or dies alone in my house only to be found months later? Is there any hope for me? I have begun to find myself extremely angry lately as well.",12Nov2020,1
28,"Sorry if this seems scattered, getting my thoughts in order is a challenge sometimes. 

I'm currently diagnosed with a moderate to severe personality disorder. I hate this. I hate the stigma and stereotypes associated with it. I hate feeling like I'm going to be like this forever - yes therapy holds good prospects for recovery, but try getting it, and then with someone you click with, and then long term. My mother is the only family member to which I have disclosed this information to, because I thought she would be the most understanding person, but last week she straight up told me she doesn't think I have a personality disorder and now I'm even more confused. 

I'm stuck between unable to remember a time when I was ""ok"" and believing there's nothing wrong with me. I was first diagnosed with anxiety and depression at 15 but I think I've been showing signs much longer than that. I got rediagnosed at 19 to a personality disorder after being hospitalised and it broke me. I'd never even heard of it before I was told, and I've gone to great lengths to hide it from everyone. I've always hidden things, I've always pretended I'm fine and normal so that people wouldn't worry, but I think I started to believe it. I had a brief stint of therapy before the person left and I was genuinely surprised to be told that I have trauma. I just don't think what I've experienced is traumatic enough. I feel like a fraud. I can't tell if it was bad and I've just convinced myself that it was fine and how to live with it (unhealthily) over many years, or if I've just managed to convince everyone else it was worse than it is. Maybe I don't even remember it right; it all feels kind of fuzzy and fake, but I also get told memory problems can come from mental health problems and substance abuse, especially in your teen years. I think my mother thinks I'm getting too old for all this stuff now, and maybe she's right. Being a teenager and self harming, abusing substances and sleeping around seems more ""acceptable"" than someone who's nearly 30. She thinks I'm just acting up and will grow out of it. She doesn't think I've experienced any trauma. Maybe I shouldn't let her impact my thinking so badly, but the fact is she's an important figure in my life and holds a lot of sway. 

I just want someone to tell me if it's all in my head. Ha. 

I hear the term ""gaslighting"" a lot, and I want to be able to apply it to her but I don't know if that's inaccurate, just another excuse I'm making, another ""trauma"" to justify having a personality disorder. Maybe I'm pretending to be this bad/getting worse because of the diagnosis. Maybe I just need attention - after all, I'm posting on Reddit for validation, right? I've tried to be more open with people recently about how I'm actually feeling, and I'm not even sure they believe me. Why would you when I look fine, when I appear put together and healthy and like my life is going right? 

I don't know, I just need to be told whether I'm fine or not. Accepting a personality disorder feels terrible, like I'm not just depressed but fundamentally flawed in some way. It's been years since I heard those words and I still don't know if I can 100% believe it, but at the same time, I find myself using it as an excuse, or at the very least a shield. I'm terrified I'm taking resources away from those who really need it. Sure, I feel at risk every day, but I also shower and go to the store to get groceries and complete normal daily tasks. I have reasons to stay alive that I think work well enough, so no one has to worry about me doing anything worse than hurting myself in a variety of ways, and I've learnt to stop it interfering with everything. I'm still basically the same depressed teenager I was a decade ago, and I'm just refusing to grow up. 

Maybe I act fine because I am. Maybe I imagined all the bad things. Maybe I just need to grow up. Maybe I'm in denial about having a personality disorder, maybe I'm in denial about not having one and just still acting like a hormonal teen with a label I can use to justify it. 

Sorry it's so long, I guess I just needed somewhere to ramble as I really don't have anyone to talk to about this in real life.",12Nov2020,1
29,"I've read a couple of stories on this forum and not as close to being as intense as mine but I just need to rant. 


I'm 17(F) graduating highschool this year, I'm in an intense program at my school that I was supposed to quit this year but I wasn't able to because of covid. That and other big problems in my family and stresses in my life that I can't seem to be able to change or switch whatsoever and I've been feeling so unmotivated and out of control.

I think I'm experiencing some sort of mental issue such as emotional burnout or even depression and I have no idea how to change that because I feel that nothing I can do can change anything in my life, and I've been asking my friends but they just tell me to ""push through it"" and trying to be encouraging but it's only been less than 3 months of school and have had several mental breakdowns, some of which lasted for weeks ""accidentally"" kind of self sabotaging my relationships, school, etc. I know the control over my life is slipping because of my lack of motivation to do anything (used to bake anything and be all fashionable for fun but it just doesn't seem at all appealing anymore).

I can't really go to a health professional because of my strict parents and covid that's in my area.

Is there anything I can do with myself to feel motivated again?

Again, this isn't as close to alot problems in this forum but I think I just need to seek out for some advice. I'm also not sure if this is the right forum since I usually only listen to reddit on youtube.",12Nov2020,1
30,I'm too lethargic. I haven't washed my face in two days. Having nowhere to go doesn't help either.,12Nov2020,1
31,"A former good friend of mine appears to be in a mental health spiral and I'm  worried about him and what he might do to himself or others.   We were close friends between 2006 and 2013.  After not hearing from him for years, he texted me out of the blue making threats to me and my husband on Sunday and again today.   He then directed me to his twitter account to read more.

Based on the bizarre texts and the content of his twitter account it appears he's been melting down for a few days now.  There are hundreds of tweets in the last few days.  He appears to be paranoid and delusional (including delusions of grandeur)  and is ranting about a cabal against him, naming everyone he thinks is evil or a demon or a lizard person.  He calls out biblical figures and historical figures and says they're still alive.  Then he lists people he seems to perceive are on his side somehow as bodhisattvas or autopilots.    Most disturbingly he appears focused on a woman we knew back in 2006 whom he had a crush on then.  She did not share his feelings.  It appears now he is deeply obsessed with her.   Even scarier he appears to be angry with the infant child of a couple he knows and believes the baby is evil.   He repeated calls me and my husband evil or demons or lizard people.  He tweeted that we're being controlled by my cat, Son of Sam style.  He says all of his family members are demons. 

Right now I don't believe I'm in immanent danger because I believe he's more that 2000 miles away from me.   I can't say the same for his family who I believe live close to him.  I have no idea where the woman he's obsessed with lives, nor the couple with the baby he's angry at are.  It's not clear to me if any of them know what's going on with him and I have no way of contacting them to warn them.

I don't know what if anything I should do.  I can't tell if his texts and his behavior is a cry for help, attention, or if he's really threatening us.  I don't want to believe he's threatening us, but if he is we need to take it seriously.  Calling the cops to do a welfare check on him seems very risky because:

* He's clearly mentally ill and most cops aren't trained real well do deal with people in the midst of a breakdown.
* He's POC
* He's physically imposing - 6 foot 2, broad shouldered and powerfully built
* He's former military and owned firearms when we knew him, it is safe to assume he still does
* When we last saw him he was starting to use hallucinogens on a regular basis, prior to that he smoked A LOT of weed.  Coming in contact with cops probably means he'll be arrested for drug use and possession
* He lives very close to Ferguson, Missouri so it's not like the cops around there have a good track record  (for non-Americans google 'Michael Brown Ferguson'). 

What should I do?  How can I help him?  Is there anything else I can do besides calling the cops?  

It doesn't feel right to ignore this but I also don't want to respond to him and make things worse or make us a bigger target.  

Any advice you're willing to give would be much appreciated.",12Nov2020,1
32,"I don't really know what to do. School makes me feel suicidal most days and at some point I feel like I'm going to be pushed over the edge. I guess it's the overwhelming work, as well as anxiety and stress of other things too. Being there isn't too difficult most days, but that is because I really numb myself down. I feel the effects after and before school a lot, it feels like it's just chipping away at me daily. I don't know how long I can hold out for. It's been like this for almost four years now. I want to give up. Small things can trigger off my thoughts, so simply being told to answer something in class and getting it wrong can spiral my mind into having bad thoughts. I don't care about if the people around me want me to be alive, I know it sounds cold but I'm just too tired. I don't care if a family member or friend tells me repeatedly that they want me to live, I don't really feel anything to it. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because I don't like the thought of causing trauma to a stranger in case I suicide in public in some way. Also because most methods I can go to aren't guaranteed and I might die in pain. I'm so tired. I don't know how much longer I can hold out for. I take therapy but it doesn't really help.

34,"One thing that's stopping me committing suicide is the fact that if someone finds me, I will undergo admissions to hospital and then a psychiatric ward where I will be monitored and possibly medicated against my will. I don't want to go through that, and haven't found a method that would be sufficient enough in order for this not to happen. I just want to be able to die in peace, not exactly enjoy my last moments - but be able to relax in the knowledge that this is final, and I won't have to go through with a life that I really don't want to live.
Everyone says that a mental illness is comparable to a physical illness, you just can't see it. So why shouldn't I be allowed to just die? When I had to, unfortunately, euthanise my dog, I just wished it were me.

35,"These past thirty-six years, my issues have made a wreckage of my life.

I have been suicidal many times, although I ""only"" tried once. Mostly, I think I am past that. On good days, I tell myself that there is still so much to live for and so many reasons to hope.

My medication helps. I take sertraline and risperidone, and most nights I can sleep now. The edge on my moods is no longer so sharp.

Still, every year it gets a little harder to shake this sense of despair. All my friends are digital - it's nothing for me to go days and sometimes weeks without human contact. I have been on a disability pension for two years, now.

Everything is so hard. It is a fight to get myself to shower or make dinner or take care of my apartment. My landlord has tried to evict me three times now.

I am just so tired. Tomorrow I will speak to another new social worker - on the phone, of course, thanks to the pandemic. I miss the days when at least there was that much face-to-face contact.

It just all feels so pointless. Every day goes by in a blur, now. It feels like I have already given up in so many way, but I haven't and I won't. I just wish that I could.",12Nov2020,1
36,"My sister (35 yrs old) has been struggling with paranoid schizophrenia for over 10 years. First real ""episode"" she was admitted to hospital for over 1 month. Has had good support from family and professionals along the way. Had a second ""episode"" about 5 years ago. She is currently starting another, triggered by COVID in March. She has basically gotten back to living with my parents since COVID (on/off sick leave and back and forth from her apartment to my parents house). At this point she is refusing to take her meds, to the point my parents had to physically force her..I've tried speaking with her on the phone but she basically just stares, she just seems to be processing things in her brain and will barely speak. When she does she states she feels she deserves to be living on the street. She kept trying to leave the house with a sweater and a sleeping bag, and that's when she was convinced by my parents to go to the hospital, where they are now waiting for her to be admitted. I know the hospital right now is the best place for my sister, they will better know how to manage the situation then us.

My question to all of you is: what is the best way I can help my parents, give them some sort of support.I feel like it is a simple answer of: do the simple things such as phone calls and encouragement? but I am hoping there is more. What has worked for you guys? Some sort of family picture album, edited videos, i don't know...

My mind is so unfocused I can't even enjoy reading because I can't remember anything that I read. Audiobooks are exactly the same. I'll get halfway through before realizing that I don't have the slightest idea as to what's going on. What happened to me? I used to love reading. I used to be great at reading but I now I can't even comprehend something I should be enjoying. I also have a writing hobby that I keep telling myself I'm going to quit. I'm so close to quitting it right now because there's no such thing as a respected author that can't even read properly. Also, what's the point of spending so much time writing if I don't even know if people will like it? I refuse to pour so much of my heart and soul into a project if there's even the slightest chance of people not liking it. If I can't get money and respect from my work, then why bother?

41,"I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for a few years now (though I think I suffered much longer, just didn't receive help) and in these past months, my depression has been worse than ever. Besides the impact my depression is having on my school work and overall life, today I experienced something that really freaked me out, and I was hoping someone would have a similar experience or be able to tell me what it was. 

I took a short nap, about 25 or so minutes, and was awoken by my alarm. I remember laying in bed, feeling like I couldn't move, my hand was in a distorted pose and my jaw was rigid.  I knew I was entering into sleep paralysis, so I shut my eyes and forced myself back to sleep. That was an awful fucking decision. The fear and symptoms I woke up to followed me into a nightmare, and the weird part was that there was nothing scary about the nightmare, it was literally me waking up in my bed in my apartment to my alarm. However, in the dream my jaw was rigid, I couldn't speak, I couldn't move correctly, I was choking and gasping for air, and no matter who I tried to get to help me (my roommates and boyfriend) they all just ignored me. When I finally woke up because of another alarm that was set to go off about 15 minutes later, physically I was fine. But my chest and arms were flushed, my heart was racing, and I felt so much fear. I wouldn't say I woke up in a panic attack, but more so felt like I was on the come-down of one. I have no idea what happened to me during that time, but it was awful.

He was at his friends house who was a dick head and egoistic person, fazil kept the phone on charging over there, his friend was looking around the phone that i gave him and over there he found the  pictures of the girl i was dating, since he had no idea who she was he took the pictures of her and sent it to his own phone suddenly one day the brother of the girl whom i was dating texted me to meet him behind the school. i went to meet him and i knew that he was a very angry person but yet he talked to me with respect he just asked me ""did you really do it?"" I was like "" what? What did i do?""  I had no idea ehat he was talking about .He said that he got to know from someone that you showed my sisters picture to fazils friend i was so shocked after hearing that!

Because he should have he had the right to! and deep inside i wanted him to.. But he just looked to me as his own brother only just because his sister loved me and he couldn't take away his sisters happiness.. the guy who had her pics had deleted it and said that whatever it was the matter wont get outside its between us and it wont get outside . My girlfriends brother just told me to go and so i just left.. i wanted to talk to him i didn't wanted to go i wanted him to get all his anger out on me because it wasn't just me who is so much angry on me it was also me who wanted to kill myself for it.. and i just couldn't let it go but i just left.. i told my girl what happened she cried and cried... but she understood and said  it wasn't your fault .. and just we canot change what happened.. even after all that happened things got better with me and her but still...every night i cant sleep knowing that it was all because of me that her pictures were with someone else.

44,"Hi everyone! First time posting here


So for some background I’m 17 I’ve been diagnosed not even a year ago with ADHD. I’ve also had some serious depressive tendencies tho they seem to be gone. Well for the most part. I think I might have PMDD so they kinda come back each month. I’m also really anxious but I don’t think I’m officially diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. 


My mom is really against medication and she’s quite in a conspiracy phase. I used to be against taking medication myself because of my familial antecedent. I don’t remember all the details so I’m sorry if it isn’t super clear. But basically my father was on an inadequate antidepressant for him for a couple of years and it made some irreversible damage. He is now bipolar. He is officially diagnosed but still kinda rejected his diagnosis. But that’s another story. 


So because I know a lot of this is hereditary I was always on the fence about taking any type of medication. Also my mother was also never really prone to it neither so I guess I was influenced also by that. 


But now I’m really struggling. And I don’t have the same support I had before. If you want to lurk on my profile go ahead. I mentioned a couple of stuff xD. But yeah let’s just sum it up by saying my life is a bit chaotic right now. So now I’m kinda warming up to idea of taking medication. I’m seriously thinking about it. I don’t what I want to threat specifically yet like more my adhd or my anxiety or perhaps my possible PMDD or all of them? That I don’t know. But we’re gonna discuss it more with my psychologist in our next appointments. 


So my mom isn’t doing so well right now because of what’s happening in our life and she has a lot of difficulty with me growing up and becoming more independent. She didn’t dealt with it well with my brother and sister but I think it’s worse with me since I’m the last child of the family. So there’s already a lot of tension within her already and I have a lot of tension within me so of course there are a lot of tensions between us. And the fact that I’m thinking about taking medication add more to it. 


So I just don’t really know what to do. 


Where I live the health care system is free so it’s not like she’ll be paying for that. And I’m legally in age to make all my medical decisions too. The only implication that she would have would be to drive me to my appointment with my future psychiatrist because I don’t have my drivers licenses yet(covid kinda got in the way) and I live in a small town with no public transportation. 


Basically how do I handle this? I feel like she could almost cut me out of her life at least emotionally not necessarily physically if I decide to go through with it. But I feel like I want to explore that kind of treatment and see if it could actually help me. Tho I’m not a 100% convince I want to. So should I just kinda forget about it to buy peace with my mom?

48,"So, I am a teen in high school. As you can probably already imagine, this is going to have something to do with online schooling. I have always been known as a top tier student and always dedicated my all to achieving the best marks. This year, however, I have been getting really below my average marks in several classes and I've never done so badly in my life. Not failing, but a fail in my book.

For the last year I have been feeling like I’m not here , like I’m not in tune with reality. A year ago I smoked weed at a party and I passed out really bad . I woke up the next morning and didn’t feel right , it felt like everything I was doing I wasn’t doing for myself. Almost like I died at the party bc I never passed out before. I looked up   certain reasons why this may have happened I simply tried to live with it. Until a couple months I have been having panic attacks where it feels like I’m gonna loose my mind. During this panic attacks I just feel like nothing real and my surroundings get hazy. I question everything I do such as “the way I walk , like am I really walking” I question my breathing everyday like am I breathing. I feel as if I’m making up reality like I’m not really here and it sucks because everything around me has been going good I just don’t feel like it real and it’s scares me. Is anyone feeling this ?

62,"2 months ago, I hit a spot in life where I was just absolutely miserable all the time. I cannot tell you a single moment in which I was happy except for when I was on shrooms or adderall, and that wasn’t because it was a good experience, it was just cause those drugs induced euphoria. One day, I decided I was tired of being miserable and wanted to change my lifr around... so I did.

I moved out of state and back into my own apartment, I got a good job, I reconciled with my boyfriend, I stopped trying/doing drugs, and other accomplishments. I have done a lot of great things for myself. Yet, for some reason, I’m not really... happy with myself. In fact, I’m just... bored.

I’m bored. I’ve lost interest in everything. I miss being intoxicated, I miss being impulsive, I miss CRYING, I miss being sad, I miss listening to my sad music and feeling something to it, I miss complaining on social media or finding things to relate to/be amused by, I miss being completely alone, I miss all these things I worked hard to get OUT of.

63,"I have emotionally unstable personality disorder, anorexia, and social anxiety if you’re wondering. 

I don’t think I ever will be. I’ve been unhappy for so long that it just feels weird when I’m lucky enough to be happy for a few hours every now and then. Last time I remember being happy was maybe 4 months ago. I was just walking through town with two friends, and I realised all of a sudden I didn’t just feel like I wasn’t depressed, or apathetic, I felt actually happy. That lasted maybe an hour. I can’t be honest with myself when I’m depressed either. I just tell myself that everyone feels like I do. Maybe that’s true or maybe not, I don’t think I could ever know. When I see someone is happy I just assume they’re one in a million. I can’t imagine ever being happy except as a result of mental illness like bipolar. I’ve given up hope for ever being happy and I can’t tell if I’m upset about that or not. I just think everyone who’s happy is lying to themselves and if ever I feel happy then I must be lying to myself as well. I don’t feel like I can trust myself with those kinds of deductions. I don’t know if what I think is just a result of mental illness. I don’t think I’m normal enough to tell myself what is and what isn’t, but to be honest I don’t know what normal is. 

I think, and maybe I’m absolutely wrong about this, but I think the only way I’d feel happy is if I could find someone who I could love more than I love myself, and I can love myself too much sometimes, depending on how bad my EUPD is at the time. The symptom I get strongest is the unstable/distorted self image. I don’t know if I’m a criminal or a saint. Some days I love myself, some days I hate myself. I think even if I felt happy because I found someone I truly love, it wouldn’t be real happiness. It’d be a false sense of happiness. Thats what it’s always felt like in the past, at least after the fact. 

Sometimes I wish I was more depressed so I’d kill myself. The more depressed I get the more scared of death I become, until a certain point. After that I feel nothing at all, and the fear of death disappears. I used to cry every night. Now I never cry, but I wish every day that I could go back to the time I could actually cry. I was actually so much happier then. Now I don’t feel anything. I think I’d of killed myself if it weren’t for my mum. I love her to death but sometimes I wish she’d die so I could kill myself without having any effect on her.

I’m still in love with someone, 3 years after I met her as of last month. I don’t want to say anything more about that.

There’s not really any point to this post, I just don’t want to tell anyone close to me. I don’t feel like it’s fair on them.",12Nov2020,1

65,"Since the month of May, 2020 I have seen the death of two people close to me and another one on the way, I got dumped by ex in August due to the fact that she fell out of love and I was too much of a mess. These last few months have been very very draining for me, I didn't have the energy to do anything. I was in a freefall, but now I have started gripping myself back to reality, I can't bring back those who have died or who have left while I needed them the most but what I can and would do is be there for myself, give the same amount of love and encouragement I would've given to someone who was going through the same things as I am/was.

What I would like to point out is, please seek help when you are at your lowest and talk to people if there's no one, seek therapy. But, don't let yourself get into a freefall. I have started slowly fixing my life, taking care of all the pending work, eating good, healthy food, and especially doing things which I love like playing games. The void won't be filled in a day but overtime I would be have to be the one that would fill it up not by suppressing my emotions rather accepting them and nourishing that void with good things, things which uplift my soul. 

So, to all my brothers and my sisters out here dealing with pain, loss, suffering, loneliness, addiction, delusion whatever it is. 

STAY STRONG AND BE THERE FOR YOURSELF, YOU CAN GET THROUGH THIS. 

ALL MY LOVE AND POWER TO YOU ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Background: I have bipolar 2, GAD, and more. I had a hell of a time back in 2017 where I went in and out of the hospital 4 times, the last after a serious attempt on my life that ended up with me in a coma in the ICU for 10 days. After that, I turned it around. I started some really intensive outpatient treatment, got back on my feet, re-started medical school, and had been doing pretty well since.

And then enter my 3rd year of med school...my life is turning to shit as a product of circumstance, I think. Last week I was made to work over 80 hours, and then expected to do assignments and study on top of it. And then we get lectured on “time management,” when really the only time I have left after work, travel, taking care of basic needs like showering and eating (neither of which I’ve been doing consistently) is sleep...so they’re telling me to not sleep. I literally worked three 15 hour shifts in 1 week, with the rest being 10 hour shifts...oh, and one “short” 6 hour “half day.” How the fuck am I gonna survive this? I am burned out. My thoughts have slipped into a dark place. I am constantly thinking about hurting myself. Those thoughts had been practically non-existent for the last 2ish years. And now it’s all I can think about again. I’m scared. Terrified. I’m working with my therapist, and she’s great, but she can do nothing to help me with what is causing me to feel this way. I am terrified of ending up back in the hospital, because if I do, my career is ruined. Everyone keeps telling me to “make sure to take care of myself,” and I’d love to...but with what time? I hardly have time to walk the dog and eat dinner, which is my one free hour a day. Sometimes I don’t even get that.
I don’t want to hurt myself in reality. But I feel like I fucked up with my career choice, because I just can’t handle this. I love being with my patients and caring for them, but I am starting to hate everything else about medicine. I’m not tough enough, smart enough, or deserving enough to hold the title of doctor some day. I have no one I can go to at the school for help with this stuff, either. Some people have really great advisors that will talk to them about this stuff, but mine has no empathy or patience for things like this. Plus, I’m afraid they’d overreact to my depression (they have in the past when I was stupid enough to be honest.) I feel alone in a world where I’m surrounded by people. I need a mentor, but I don’t have one. I need someone to tell me how to get through this. I need help. I just don’t know where to go.",12Nov2020,1

76,"Hey guys, I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible but I’m sorry if I don’t. This is very near and dear to my heart and I’ve been reluctant to post this..

I met my best friend about 2 years ago, and me having a psychology background (almost went to school for it) in that I’ve always loved and enjoyed learning it, very quickly realized that she was struggling with some very deeply rooted and major traumas that reflected themselves in her everyday perception of life and the way she acted; without her even realizing it.
She is a very sweet girl with such a big, loving heart and I try to remind her about how none of what she’s gone through is her fault &amp; how it’s not at all normal (mainly so she understands what is &amp; isn’t ok or acceptable. And that, even though she’s allowed it in the past, is not acceptable in the way she’s treated as a person.

Fast forward to today, on the surface she is finally at a place where we can talk about her past trauma and abuse from previous disgustingly toxic relationships from past boyfriends, without her crying or falling into a deep state of depression. She no longer lets that be a negative focus in her life, &amp; it helps her to have someone who genuinely cares, loves, and supports her and listens to her. But of course I am no expert and am seeking help with anything low cost or for anyone without insurance.

****
I come to this thread to ask HOW &amp; WHERE can I get help or a therapist for her even though she doesn’t have insurance???
****


(Continued)
She used to cut herself and expressed to me how whenever she did so it would help her feel better because she’d feel she deserved it. It’d be an adrenaline rush that she’d go through to feel alive. She grew up under a messy divorce and would see everyday how an abusive father hit her mom etc. Naturally this reflected into her interactions with men since she also didn’t have strong parental figures in her life, in which at around about 14 years old she began dating older men in their late 20’s and early 30’s (similar to her dad’s age at the time). Her first boyfriend who sexually assaulted her and also emotionally &amp; physically abused her, ultimately setting the precedent for her future toxic relationships. She experienced this without her realizing or understanding how it was wrong because of how young she was so it soon became her own normal.
I have helped her get far in this journey to the point where she no longer harms herself and slowly she’s been able to be more open and honest with me about what she is struggling with.
She half jokingly told me the other day how she can’t help being a ‘whore’ (she expressed that obviously it hurt if others called her that, even thought she viewed herself that way, so it was only ok for her to call/refer to herself like that) because I mentioned how she enjoys having sex a lot. I jokingly called her a nympho which was when she explained to me that lowkey that’s why it was like a drug for her. because of that feeling of a man genuinely wanting and desiring her, she craves and desires that form of love and affection. But the reality is that most guys don’t actually want her, they want her because she’s a little easier to get to bed than most; so it’s superficially and hollow. Her self worth is extremely low and I really don’t want her to fall down a darker path because I really love her. You shouldn’t be loved or feel wanted because of what you DO for someone else or how you make others feel; you should be loved simply for WHO YOU ARE.

She is beginning to see her own self worth and not allow other guys to step on her in that aspect. The main problem now, is that I am afraid for her as she actively seeks a romantic spark, I don’t want her to continue to batter herself down by getting in and out of toxic relationships centered on sex and lust, not love and respect. I am working with her and I am seeking help because I’m not a professional in this field, just a close friend.






Some background info:
So she lives at home with her mom and step dad but they either don’t have her under their healthcare, or mental illness isn’t covered under their insurance. She’s had to be very independent financially since high school and pretty much pays for everything herself, and is planning on moving out soon. I am willing to help her with costs or anything else that can get her to that next milestone in her treatment.

She sometimes has moments where she’s extremely transparent and herself and she’ll confess things to me. But then she’ll put up a front, disguised as a joke to move on or not focus too much on the topic. On one of these occasions she told me that she knew what her problem was:
She never received that affection a daughter normally receives from her dad throughout her childhood, and instead saw how he treated her mom.
She confessed this to me and also that she is always confused by me because I’m the only guy she’s ever met that has stuck around this long and genuinely cares for her &amp; doesn’t objectify her, which is why she says she is really in love with me. That’s the reason why she falls in love so quickly with guys and why she always ends up falling into toxic relationships. 
She has told me this very recently but SHE DOESNT KNOW HOW TO FIX IT !!!!

She is at a stage where she’s told me she’d seek the help of she were able to or knew how to. I am actively seeking help for her on her behalf &amp; she really needs the professional help. please. again, any information helps

I've begged for help from my parents but they refused, ""If its really that bad, you deserve to be treated like a 2 year old.""

92,"man idek what to say i’ve had guns racked to my head, only person i could ever talk to about my problems was my girlfriend and she had to move 16 hours away and so now i got to be far from my only support. My mom doesn’t have an interest in me except to yell and she has ended up her nights slurring drunk 5-6 days of the week as long as i can remember, my sister is 25 and blackmailed me to try and steal a few hundred and still lives under my same roof free loading daily and being a nasty street female leaving trash places. i have physically fought my dad and step dad, i just lost my grandma, the one person who i would spend the night with when my parents were being out out of control, my grandmas loss got to grandpa and i went to see him on halloween and he passed out at 11:40 a.m. because he was too drunk into my arms, he would of hit his head pretty hard like he normally does if i wasn’t there, he is an alcoholic.

Another thing i think will always be hard is that my mom got out of the streets with me when i was born, i can’t just throw my life away because i’m already too far removed from the streets, i have a chance to finish school and all that so i need to do it because i know i can but i’m in this rich kid school and these teachers don’t care about what i got going on and just load me up with busywork like another privileged white child i get NO support and if i was to tell this soft ass school that they’d call cps and fuck my whole life up so i be ANGRY ASF because i am TRYING so hard and so much harder than everyone around me and i keep getting set back and these mfs are getting free cars and resources i would’ve used to be so much further already then i already am and i literally had to put my life on the line everyday for 6 months to get my first car. I even had a job for a year🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ i was a illegally underage cook at dairy queen getting minimum wage to train other incompetent cooks to get paid 10 an hour! that money at the time went towards weed so i didn’t go crazy and general shit that i needed that my mom wouldn’t buy, and I know i wanted a strong back not a light load but why do i have to work so hard with so little support and get it rubbed in my face in school everyday that the kids around me have it better.

btw all this anger is piled up and i’m trying to graduate school whilst also putting myself in situations where i am 100% ready to kill if something goes wrong so it’s kinda like who knows if it’s even worth it

Some major rejection sensitivity but I don’t think I’m bpd, I just isolate from everything and shut up)

Therapists have always given the same advice: write down who loves you, what you’re good at, stop the negative voice in your head. It’s not like I want to think I’m worthless, but it’s just fact. I have no proof that I’m not hideous, toxic, stupid, etc. and nobody who knows me would say otherwise. I have no accomplishments by any measure. It doesn’t feel irrational and honestly, there isn’t a little voice. Nothing has to remind me I suck.

I don’t have any friends, have never dated, and wouldn’t. It’s too easy to imagine myself putting up with abuse. I hate my body and my soul. Never seen anyone else express this and not sure how to fix it. (Neither have therapists :/) Idk if there’s anything left to try.",12Nov2020,1

I wanted to get on medication so I could get the things done that I need to for work, my family etc.  but now my anxiety has me so stressed that I’m not getting anything done for a completely different reason.

Whenever I felt anyone show me some attention it'd lead down to sexting and showing off my junk. 

I'm now 30 and realizing that what I thought was normal cause of movies like American Pie etc etc, now I am fighting to do more with my life than find an SO and having sex. Problem is I spend money on shit like onlyfans and camsites which makes me feel Soo weak as a grown man. I want to learn how to fight urges like this so I can worry about my future with my career. 

I also wrote on a notepad not to jerk off, not to fall back on sexual desires but I always slip up. I thought maybe coming to a subreddit like this would have some advice for a guy like me. I just wanna move on from my past and actual LIVE life.

99,"   As of late, all I hear are negative comments made towards me (M20) and it’s bringing me down. I’m known to be a bit aloof at times, and mentally I’m not always locked in. This has given me a certain reputation of not always being serious and not always producing a good finished product for a task I’ve been given. 
   At a job I’ve been at for four years now that I’ve become burnt out on, I can get lost in the monotony, and some of my coworkers love to drop snide comments about how I don’t work efficiently. There is truth to this at times, but I’m always reliable and anything I’m told to do get done gets done. I take pride in the work I do, but it’s never good enough for anyone else. An old HS classmate has been hired on recently, and she refuses to see me as a senior coworker, and hold the old version of me she sees as a kid in HS who doesn’t take things seriously.
   In my relationship we don’t always see eye to eye on our future goals. 
   She is very much a family woman and is ready now for kids and marriage, but I want to live life before children and I want to be financially and professionally set as best as possible before I consider raising a kid. This leads to a lot of negativity from her because she just can’t understand that we may never see eye to eye on this, and she makes me doubt myself and my ability to be a good partner.
  Rant over, how do I push past all of this negativity, and not cave into the vicious cycle of “people tell me I’m a failure and I’m not as good as I think I am, so what’s the point of trying to better?” Ive been stuck in this position for a while now and it’s really really wearing on my mental health.

Recently and by recently I mean around 3-4 month I can’t calm down and I’m always stressed. My mind likes to stress and fear a lot more.  Sometimes the stress and fear fades and it’s like I’m looking at a whole new world with unlimited possibilities. But when they are still in my mind which is the majority of the time everything seems hazy and depressing. For a bit of background I have played video games ever since I knew what they were. I have always considered video games a hobby of sorts but recently and this happens in all my hobby’s, I always see somebody more dedicated then me and feel like I must set out to be more like them. Even if I don’t really want to my mind tells me I have to to prove it’s a interest of mine. It always like I’m losing my happiness and can’t calm down. Literally anytime I’m not with a friend or doing one of my hobby’s  my mind drifts instantly to thoughts of others hatred of me and how I must be like those who are more dedicated within these hobby’s or abandon the hobby all together. It’s stressful getting past these thought but once I do I can actually enjoy life and I feel like nothing can stop me.  But these views that are always on my mind hurt because I love these but they cover up the good things and focus on the bad side of these hobby’s. Earlier when I said everything seems hazier this is a problem I really hate. When I see something like a video game with incredible graphics my eyes see not only the game but everything around me as dull. When everything is hazier the only thing I can do is think and this is where the thoughts really hurt. I can’t stop them and they end up making me do things like this where I make a alt account so nobody knows I’m feeling this way while still seeking help. But it’s painful to see things I normally enjoy seem so hazy and dull. Also I did not mention this but I’m still in high school and I’m too scared to tell my parents.",12Nov2020,1

A while ago, someone messaged me on Discord saying he had seen me around and wanted to get to know me. I was super freaked out at first because he knew my name and what I looked like but I don't really speak to anyone outside of my friend group. My friends and I met him and he seems nice but I can't help but be wary and suspicious of him. I don't trust him at all and I feel bad about being cold to him because he doesn't seem like a bad person.
Recently, a classmate of mine invited me to do homework at her dorm and I agreed because we've had a few conversations before and she seems nice and smart. I stayed there for a few hours before I had to leave. Before I left, she asked if I wanted to have dinner with her and continue studying but I declined. Later that night, she invited me over again because she was making cookies but I ignored her messages and pretended I was asleep. 
I keep thinking ""why do these people want to be friends with me?"" I don't know if I'm being overly anxious and suspicious of genuinely nice people or if I'm justified in feeling this way.

I am not failing, but I feel as If I should be doing better but can't. I just spent the majority of today freaking out because I wrote 3 and a half pages of a narrative assignment, instead of 2 like made teacher had said. My teacher said it is fine that I went a bit overboard as long as it is not redundent, but I still felt I have failed in someway. It also does not help that  the person I have been attracted to for a long time is in that class. I felt like I couldn't breath when I first saw her enter. I just imagine that person acing every assignment while I will end up failing, and be taken out of the class meaning I can't be equal to her. I also try talking to her, but have a hard time knowing what to say. I feel that maybe if I was someone better, like one of my friends for example, I could maybe pull something off. I am having a hard time staying focused in class, and end up putting in low effort assignments for my vocation. I really like the class, but I just have a lack of motivation. I have also become really insecure about my height. I am a bit over 5,6, while my friends, which I used to be taller or equal height, are now much taller than me. I am 15 if it matters much. I am told to do tasks by my parent, but I end up screwing it up. Like looking in the fridge and grabbing cheese for example. I will just look around frantically and never end up finding it which usually gets my parent pissed at times, and they'll say things like ""you need to wake up"" or ""You are almost an adult you can't be doing this anymore."" Going back to my crush, I haven't been able to stop thinking about them. I told them how I felt, and they responded really well, but nothing has come of it. I wanted to hangout, but she told me she was still scared of covid. I hope it is not really because of me.

I came out of one of these blackouts in hospital. I had apparently been trying to run into traffic and screaming at people trying to stop me to just let me die. I was eventually stopped by police and taken to hospital, where I was put on a psych hold. Even though I'm not suicidal, I didn't argue because I was scared of blacking out again and succeeding in hurting myself.

However, the doctors there straight up did not believe that I'm not suicidal and don't remember doing that. I was begging them to do an MRI or something to see if I have a tumour or something, because something is seriously wrong with my brain. Eventually they actually asked about my symptoms, which I explained (lost time, weird out of body experiences, zoning out for hours, hearing voices), but I just got discharged with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and a script for meds. 

I swear I'm not schizophrenic, the hearing voices is the only symptom that matches, and the voices are more like an internal monologue of multiple people, not as if I'm hearing people speaking when no one's speaking, and people with schizophrenia have told me it doesn't sound like auditory hallucinations.

119,"Hi folks, hoping someone might be able to give some guidance. I hope my post doesn't come across in a bad way. Pretty much, I have been through a lot of difficult situations recently. It seems to have left me really beat down and depressed. I've faced a lot in my life, and been depressed as a result at times, but I've always been able to bounce back and deal with it. But this time I'm struggling to do so. It's greatly damaging my ability to work, so I'm thinking to ask for some sort of anti-depressant or something. That's totally new territory for me, so I'm not even sure what to ask for or what to say. I believe my depression is 100% related to my situation. Among other things, I've encountered some really serious health issues in the last year that have effected my quality of life. Things like that have just left me depressed. I guess what I mean to say is, I don't think it's an issue with my brain chemistry, rather just, well, life has depressed me. Not trying to say this is good or bad or better or worse than someone who is depressed for no reason - I'm just not sure if that's an important distinction or not, and merits mentioning. I've also lost tons of weight recently, to the point I am now very underweight, and I wonder if my depression is just because of my low weight.

I am in a creative field, and so it's really important I don't take medication that interferes with my ability to think creatively. This is really important to me. Will anti depressants do this? There seem to be so many things... anxiety medications? anti depressants? I don't even know what to ask for. Unfortunately I don't have tons of time or ability to go back and forth on medication, so trying to do a little looking to find something that might work initially.

Thank you for your time and for reading my post.

One of the things about my depression is I'm really not sad. I'm just kind of nothing. I think so much has happened recently I've just sort of, retreated in to nothingness. I'm not sad writing this, and don't worry I'm not suicidal or anything. I am 100% motivated by wanting to be able to work again and express myself creatively.",12Nov2020,1

122,"So I recently lost my bearded dragon. She was a rescue, I'd had her for years, but she contracted some kind of illness and passed away. At the time, I was in a deep bout of depression. I have my ups and downs and it varies by the week, but this was the lowest point I had ever been. Somehow laying my beloved pet to rest and working my way through the grieving process has left me at a higher point than I once was. I am still incredibly heartbroken about the death of my pet, but my general outlook and negative thoughts have improved drastically. Had anyone ever experienced something like this?

123,"A lot of things about my own personality, emotions, etc. confuse me. I feel no emotions 90% of the time, I can't form romantic attractions, I have felt suicidal but couldn't bring myself close to actually doing it, I care about my friends more than my family, my self-esteem might as well night even exist, my beliefs and how I feel contradict each other very often, I can't vent without some sort of anonymity or else I get extremely bad anxiety, I feel no motivation to do anything, I could keep listing these kinds of things on and on. What confuses me is that I have no idea what causes all of it. My life itself is pretty much fine, I have support from my friends and family who care about me, I live in a good home, I seem to make friends fairly easily. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me. My family thinks I have Aspergers, which I usually use as an excuse for myself. I doubt that's the only thing that's happening though, it feels like there's more to it, I just can't for the life of me figure out what. Maybe I have some weird-ass mental issue, or Aspergers really is to blame for all of it, or maybe I'm just a pansy. I can't afford therapy, so that option's out the window. I don't think my family knows about the majority of my problems since I can't vent to them without having an anxiety attack. Nobody that knows about my issues seems to be able to explain it. I doubt I'd be feeling this way because of literally nothing, or maybe that is the case and I'm just being an idiot. Who knows. At this point I feel tired of rambling, so I'll let you all make of this what you will.

124,"Hi all, throwaway because my SO is on here too lol.  

About a month ago my SO of ten+ years had what i can only describe as a paranoid breakdown.  She was fine one moment, took a shower, then came running from the bathroom close to completely deliriously terrified, and rambling about things that even after a month of cycling through various stages of this and much discussion, i still don't even understand.  What followed has been the worst month of my life (and I'm sure hers times 1,000 but she doesn't fully acknowledge what's happening).  We managed to get her some Xanax thrua  friend to calm down that first episode, and there's been a rollercoaster of mania and paranoia and anger, all seeming to stem from EXTREME anxiety overload.  She's not been handling the Covid situation or the political discourse here in the states well at all, and it also seemed vaguely related to the return of her menstrual cycle after many years without one due to a BC implant in her arm.  During one of her clearer spells in this midst of this i actually managed to get her to a GP doctor (a huge accomplishment by itself i guess) who referred her to an OBGYN for removal of the old implant.  She wasn't very honest with the GP, just said she was having some anxiety and thought it could be related to the old implant.  Had implant removed and was immediately almost 100% normal for almost a week, but the darkness crept back and came and went until she went in to be fitted for an IUD replacement, cue another short week or maybe less of clarity, and then the same slide back down into the darkness.   I am in the process of trying to find a window of ""sane"" her to get her back to GP, having brought up the fact it COULD be something chemical going on, not that she just hates me all of the sudden lol.  She has been more and less receptive to the idea depending on her current state.  The more ""normal"" she's acting, the more aware of how odd she's been acting she is; but when she's in any sort of hint of one of these episodes, there's basically no reaching her in a real way.  

&amp;#x200B;

I am CONSTANTLY on edge and had to go on beta blockers for my blood pressure to keep from just collapsing under the stress of trying to help her, and hold down my job and keep a roof over our heads.  IT's all worth it don't get me wrong, she's the love of my life and i will do anything for her, but WOW does it get tough being treated like i'm her brand new roomate whom she hates, when up until a month ago we had a wonderful and loving relationship with relatively few issues.  We had our routine we both enjoyed, and all that; no sign of any underlying issues and now BAM she's literally taking things that we both have enjoyed for years and twisting them into reasons that we're terrible, or she doesn't want to be around me.  Whether it's our old sex life (epic, kinky, and private thank you very much) that she now claims to have never enjoyed (despite much much much evidence to the contrary lol) or something as simple as our nightly TV watching, she is stone cold HEARTLESS at times and seems to almost enjoy my twisting in the wind trying to keep up when she gets in these states.  I swear to god i can SEE it in her eyes, the whole surrounding areas go kind of dark and almost squinty, and i know that the ""beast"" is now here with us.  it's all so very much to take in and try to comprehend, and i just wish there was any way i could help her more, or more quickly.  It's taking such a toll on me personally, and i don't see how people can possibly hang on through things like this, but i have no intention of giving up, she's my everything.  She's so special and wonderful and talented and beautiful, and i KNOW that she most likely doens't mean to destroy my very soul on basically a daily basis, but godDAMN this shit hurts even when you think you've steeled yourself for whatever might come out of their mouths next.  

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else had any experience close to this with a female SO in their mid 30's?  I would love to have any rays of hope in this dark hour.  The odd timing of the episodes that seem linked to the return of her menstrual cycle gives me hope that this may be simply a wicked hormonal imbalance (imagine if PMS and PMDD had a lovechild with FUCKING SATAN HIMSELF and we're getting close to what's going on lol).   I know her aunt had such bad hyperthyroidism to the point of having Grave's Disease, and i have read that thyroid issues can cause hormonal imbalance issues which can cause behavior that mimics bipolar or even Schizo tendencies, or can also just be revealing underlying MH issues that may have been just below the surface.

I just couldn’t deal with her, her opinions and her passive aggressive behaviour that left me feeling less than. Things got better for me. Life started to go my way again and I started to slowly crawl out of my depression. I woke up out of this depressive haze and found that I felt like an outsider to my whole family. My siblings all seems to exist within a world that involved the three of them and I wasn’t invited. They all have inside jokes and have even been vacationing together (even though they are in different provinces and there are covid restrictions). I have tried to talk to my parents about the alienation I feel but they both tell me it’s all in my head, I need to learn to shake things off and just let go of things. But no matter what I do I can’t figure out how to bridge the gap I feel with my other family members. I feel my parents advice is dismissive and doesn’t acknowledge how I feel. I even tried talking to my other two siblings but they seem to be unengaged with me. I don’t know what I did and I don’t know how to move forward. I am just not one of them anymore. As for my sister I cut out, I don’t want her back in my life and I feel better without her around but I can’t cut her completely out without cutting out my whole family.

I have been informed that “calling in” is heavily frowned upon and could affect my employment and if I’m considered reliable or not. This is not great news to me, as I genuinely understand the difference between health issues and just not wanting to work. It shouldn’t be a blanket judgment over every single employee who is not able to work for whatever reason. Apparently my reasons for not being able to work are likely not going to be taken as valid, since I’m not contagious with anything... 

Yesterday morning, I received a flu and pneumonia vaccine. The whole day I was having worsening side effects, up to the point where the last 5 hours I have very little function in my left arm as my deltoid is so inflamed and the pain fluctuates along my entire left arm/shoulder/neck.

I have an overactive immune system/autoimmune disease, so I really am not surprised my body is in shock. Hot flashes, fatigue, insomnia, drenching sweats, nausea, absolute dehydration, headaches, fluctuating shaking... it’s been varying degrees the past 18 hours or so. I’m absolutely unable to sleep. I’ve been hydrating constantly and eating here and there, iced the muscle, etc... nothing is remedying this horrible process that I have no control over.

So I risk losing my necessary job if I can’t sleep or physically be able to work at 9am. It’s currently almost 2am... my job is. 3 hours of time-sensitive efficient work before the restaurant opens. If I don’t go in to do it, it won’t get done. And I wouldn’t be surprised if I was fired. I would have contacted my boss yesterday, but I had already blindly accepted my fate of having to go in, on the off chance I wouldn’t feel worse.

Everything is just getting worse before it gets better and I feel completely lost and scared, anxious, upset, confused... I should be allowed to put my foot down in a situation like this, but I have no idea how to feel or think about it. I feel utterly and completely powerless.",12Nov2020,1

So my last therapist was just udder shot for many reasons. She blamed me for all my issues, she never talked about stuff she said we would talk about next time, and she told my mom shit we talked about. There’s some other things, but those are the biggest ones. 

The first time seeing her I didn’t like her, but I thought it was just bc I didn’t want to go to therapy. Well, 3 months later and seeing her 5 times I never saw her again thankfully. My mom had to cancel and she just never rescheduled. 

So now *I* actually want to try therapy. But my question is, how do I find one who works for me? Do things like religion and sexuality matter? Bc I really don’t know. Bc I’m bi and atheist.

138,"TW- Pedophilia/abuse

I honestly do not know if this is the right place. I hope it is. I just need support and a place to talk. I'm 16f, if that helps. 

When I was little (2-9 years old actually) I was subjected to a lot of pedophilia and abuse by my stepfather. I was diagnosed with a lot of things from this, part of which is anxiety and a minor form of PTSD.

Recently, I found out a friend I had made and desperately trusted was grooming me and other girls on a server we were on. He's older than me by far. Once I made the connection (I realized he was grooming me, so was distancing myself, but found out he was also doing it to my friends) I told the leader of our little group, and he was banned from the place we all chatted on and a bunch of us blocked him. It hurt, because I had a crush on him (a hero complex thing of some sort, like most impressionable teenagers get, I realize that fully that I am indeed like that)

The thing is, now I keep getting chest pain and overwhelming anxiety, as well as having flashbacks from when my stepdad hurt me. I can't sleep at night, which has my school schedule screwed up. I can't leave my house without panicking that I might see him, and I can't even listen to certain songs. 

I did tell my parents. And my therapist. But I don't see my therapist for another week, and I've come so close so many times to self harm after being clean for over a year. 

How do I heal from this? How do I take the steps to breathe and power through this? The meds only work for so long, and I am not even taking care of myself at this point. I need help, and any advice would be great. I live in America, btw.",12Nov2020,1

I'm a female artist. Yes, I know the stereotypes about my profession. I'm college age. Already have a degree. I earned almost a full ride to the college of my choice. I have a very small but loving family, despite their flaws. I'm single, with no real close friends anymore. Everyone left.

I was abused through my childhood, by my mother. Emotionally, mentally abused. She was a drug addict, opioids. She destroyed my self worth, ripped me apart daily with every vile name you could think of or even perhaps make up. Told me she only had me to trap my father. Pinned my worth on being able to attract the proper man. I never liked make up, and use food as a comfort, so I was fat by the time I hit puberty. This made me near worthless to her because fat women are undesirable. I was always a liar, even without lying. A traitor when I failed to take her side for any reason. I can only remember a singular time she hugged me, a month or so before she died of an overdose. It's been years since she's been gone. I've moved out of the hellhole, ramshackle house I used to live in to a nicer place with grass and a front yard. Pretty trees. Set myself to work in college, earned my scholarships after getting an associates degree. My father completely supports me, my siblings too. But I feel my mother's breath down my neck. I hate the reflection in the mirror, I can't look myself in the eye. Nothing I do feels good enough to myself, and if I fall short I feel the need to punish myself by ripping myself apart mentally. My hair is falling out, I'm gaining more weight, I have bags under my eyes that make me look gaunt. I feel far from feminine, or even female.

I used to have a friend I confided in, I even wanted a relationship. But he was in one himself, so I respected that. However, he continued to tell me he loved me, needed me around. Wanted an intimacy from me that he refused to reciprocate because of his obligations. I dangled on that string for near a decade. I grew more resentful with each gift I gave that was unreturned (christmas/birthday art, small things to show I cared), every secret I confided that was taken without reciprocated trust. He refused to open up to me. Maybe it's my fault for allowing myself to be used, to become a doormat. I became toxic towards him in time for the way I was kept at arm's length. He finally walked away a few months ago, and I feel like I've been going insane ever since. It's only me, my thoughts, my demons that sit on my shoulder. That nagging voice that despite everything says I don't add up. I don't trust people anymore really, I don't trust therapists either. The few I've seen have been nothing but trouble. One even got me kicked out of my high school as soon as I stated I had negative thoughts, no references. I was told to come back cleared by a therapist or not to come back at all, just so the school couldn't be sued if I committed suicide when they knew I was depressed. I was diagnosed bipolar shortly after.

My family doesn't believe in mental illness to a degree. They know it exists but it's considered a weakness. They become angry whenever my depression shows through, that I'm weak for not seeking help. If I won't seek it, how could I be sick? I just don't feel I'm worth the fixing up, and no amount of other people saying I am shakes the view I have of myself. I'm lonely, I know I drive people away. I don't mean to.

It has affected me in some ways, some of which being constant anxiety, sometimes bad behavior towards those I'm associated with, not reaching my full academic potential, constant procrastination etc. I've never been to therapy (one of the reasons being I don't even know where I can find a therapist in my country + other reasons). I've been struggling for a very long time and it has held me back in a lot of ways. I am constantly hating and criticizing myself for everything that I do. It feels like it's something that is blocking my brain, but I don't know what it is. I have vented about my feelings to some people and every time I have been given wonderful advice, but I just am not able to follow it. I don't want to diagnose myself with depression or disorders, because obviously I don't know anything about the field. Can such a thing be overcome without professional help?

Idk if maybe I just get excited about the prospect of whatever the topic is or it’s something deeper? My roommate calls them manic episodes but I’ve never really seen myself as manic. The topics are usually related to career fields, hobbies, health, court record deep dives, etc. Maybe I just find the stuff interesting?

I’m getting the feeding tube soon but I fear it’s too late for me. I’m still young but I’ve given everything to this eating disorder. I told myself I would be happy when I finally succumbed to my own starvation. I just wasn’t ready for it yet. I never even got to my goal weight.

156,"A bit of back story. I suffer with mental health. I'm relatively stable but when it spirals it can end up in hallucinations, ideations and make me manic. I've got a clear pattern and have been on meds through out most of my adult life (I'm 29). Recently diagnosed with Asperger's but I'm super functional. Came off meds a few months ago and doing okay. But I've been worried lately..

Every partner I've had has had mental health issues too and it always seem to be a massive downward spiral that feels like even though we both ment well it just spiralled worse and worse till we broke up. Even though at the beginning of the relationship we both seemed opposite. 

My new partner (3ish months relationship) has started showing signs of depression and anxiety. 
She has said it's not been this bad before but openly states she realises her mental health is depleting. 

I've tried to be supportive but productive and stay firm on the idea to speak to professionals and don't just keep getting stuck in a rut etc. Sleep, take meds if needed and be there as emotionally as I can.

Now I'm starting to worry like I am a trigger for my partner's mental health spiralling or something as it seems to be a set pattern with past relationships. I'm also worrying that my own mental health will start to spiral if she doesn't sort herself out. 

Is this rational?",12Nov2020,1

159,"I wanted to share something I've been working on in therapy - this is my [Sensory Toolbox](https://imgur.com/a/9To6c3w)! 

For those who don't know what that is, a sensory toolbox or a self-soothe box is a box of things you pick, that can help ground you, make you feel more relaxed and reduce panic, anxiety or help with low moods. I'm very excited to use it, so I thought I would share it here for anyone else who might find this helpful. I'll include a list of everything in my box as not everything is shown in the picture:

* A journal
* A book of Suduko puzzles
* A box of letters/cards from family and friends 
* Bubbles
* A slinky
* A squishy ball
* Marshmallow scented butterslime! (My personal favourite)
* Scented hand cream
* Scented room spray
* PVA glue (I like the sensation of peeling dried glue off my hands :P)
* A few small puzzles (snake puzzle, number puzzle)
* A paintbrush (the sensation of brushing against my skin, but also to remind me I can paint!)

The idea behind it is to have a range of sensory things, or things to distract you in a crisis or when you're having a hard time. I have a collection of items that engage my senses (tactile, smells, visual) or focus my attention on something else to help calm me down in tough moments. You can find more information on the web about it - it has already helped me so much! I hope it can be helpful for someone else too. :)",12Nov2020,1
160,"TW : mentions of suicide, self harm
I’m on mobile and this is my first time using reddit so formating might be weird. 
I (16f) really need help with whatever is going on in my head rn. I noticed I’ve been zoning out a lot recently. It can come at any time like if I’m doing the dishes, listening to a conversation, etc. and it’s definitely gotten worse over the years. I’m pretty sure that I have undiagnosed mental illness (had su*c*dal thoughts, s*lf h*rm, etc) that has progressively gotten worse as I’ve gotten older. I’ve been to therapy before, but I think I messed up because I had a hard time talking about trauma, and my mom probably only wanted me to go because I was having issues with my gender identity and I stopped going after a few weeks. Since getting my license recently, my parents let me go out alone a little to get food and stuff. Today I went out to get myself breakfast and zoned out for maybe a few minutes while driving and ran a red light. I snapped out of it once I realized I was halfway through the intersection almost about to hit a car. Luckily I stopped in time and no one was hurt but I was really shaken up. I haven’t told anyone about it in fear that I would be punished. I know that I need help, but I don’t know how to get it. I’m scared to talk to my parents about getting help because I fear their judgment and punishment. I would like to find a way to find some resources/help for myself but I don’t know what to look for. I’m from the U.S. (California) and I don’t know of any places that can help with these kinds of things. School counselors are not that great and healthcare is expensive and I’m still a minor that is still dependent on my parents. I don’t know what to do and I fear that I will get myself or someone else hurt because of this.",12Nov2020,1
161,"Those who really know me (my family), know that I've been through a lot. I had severe social anxiety/ agoraphobia and depression by the time puberty hit. I isolated myself throughout my teens and didn't attend middle or high school. Somehow I managed to get my driver's license and GED before I hit my 20's. I've had more jobs than I can recall; the longest I'd held a job was just over 2 years. I've lived on my own twice. Been in two long-term relationships. The last relationship was 4 years of abuse, during which I attempted suicide for the first (and only) time. I even got through the hellish process of filing a protective order against my ex.

I'm nearly 5 years removed from that nightmare and I suppose I'm disappointed with myself that I haven't thrived being a single adult. I have zero dependents, am physically capable, fairly intelligent, and hard-working, yet I am poor and unable to hold down a job. A year ago I ventured into a career that I hadn't ever considered and was excited in preparation for. I truly believed that particular path was going to be it for me and change my life drastically. I quickly found out I was wrong. I'm still processing the devastation and mourning the dreams I had. 

What guts me the most is being aware of the potential others see in me, what I see in myself, and just failing time and again to live up to it...Years ago I had applied for disability and was denied for ""non-compliance"" (for quitting meds or therapists when they did not help me). While I was denied, it was noted that I'd be ""expected to decompensate every couple of years"". It's not even every couple of years that my mental health takes a dive. For as long as I can remember, it's been every fucking year that I go through at least one episode of major depression that takes months to climb out of.

I wasn’t stoned on the job and I had smoked days prior so I don’t have much to worry about but obviously while I’ve been off for smoking weed I haven’t been wanting to risk smoking.

I cant even remember the time because I've been disassociating a lot. I found out she cheated on me. Not once. But the entire relationship. I was the side piece and I didn't even know it. She was cheating on me with her abusive and pedophile ""ex"". I was destroyed for the past 2?? Months. But last night I was meditating for about 3 hours straight and I finally re discovered my inner peace. After my best friends abandoned me right before I found her out and me barley being able to hold on im finally okay. It feels like the weight of the world is off of my shoulders.

175,"  

Imagine thinking a change of tone is the end of the world. Imagine thinking if someone doesn’t reply fast enough, you need to prepare yourself for them leaving. Imagine searching up ways to heal from people leaving you before it even happens. Imagine when there’s a slight change in anything your first thought is “I need to kill myself”.

My head is filled with thoughts I am forced to believe in. It’s filled with thoughts normal people wouldn’t have. What if’s play around my head daily, doubting everything that happens to me, making me suspicious of everyone’s actions. My head makes me think not believing in the worst makes me delusional. 

I make myself think that.

I force myself to stay away from others so they can’t hurt me; I rather leave them than them leaving me. I don’t want to be the one abandoned, so I do the abandoning. I’m too afraid of becoming anyone’s friend because of the fear of them leaving, so I just don’t make friends.

I hurt myself so I can feel like I’m in control. I starve myself so I can feel like I have power over myself. I take pills so I know I can easily end my life whenever I want to end it.

I’m too unstable; I don’t have a set mood for long. I get angry, sad, happy, and flirty in a matter of minutes. I never know how I truly feel, nor do I know what I want. Everything about me changes too quickly; when I’m about to finally understand myself, I switch to something else. I always lose the battle of finding out who or what I am. I always lose the battle in my head.

Maybe it’s because I don’t love myself that I think no one else does. I always assume everyone hates me, even if their actions show otherwise. I don’t want to believe someone actually cares about me - knowing that will only hurt me more. I sometimes do wish I knew how much people cared about me; if I thought people loved me maybe I wouldn’t want to die so much.

But do I want to die? Or do I just want to be happy? 

Do they love me? Or are my thoughts true?

I want to be reassured that these aren’t true, even though I won’t believe that. I just want someone to understand me in a way, I guess. I don’t want to have to explain myself to someone and just be shut down by them. I try to keep it all inside, but sometimes it gets too much. 

I think my need for someone is because of my unstable self image. I need someone to tell me what I am because I don’t know what I am myself. I need someone to choose everything for me. I think if I had that I’d understand myself a lot more.

I constantly contradict myself. Even throughout this I’ve probably done it a few times without realising. This probably also comes from my unstable image of myself and my constant mood swings. Each time my mood changes, another me arises with different views and opinions. One second I could love cherries and tell everyone about them, then the next second I hate cherries and see nothing good about them. This obviously leads to people wondering what changed or if I’m just joking around, but to be honest I don’t even know myself. These constant changes leads to me contradicting every word I say.

This kind of thinking heavily applies to the people in my life. If you do one bad thing I’ll hate you for a while until my mood goes back to loving you. I can go from talking behind your back to wanting to do everything with you. The problem is anything can make me hate you, even things you might not notice. It’s hard to maintain friendships like this.

I have so many triggers, I don’t know what triggers me. Something that might trigger me now can change tomorrow, so I can’t even make myself stay away from those triggers.

I’m a human ticking time bomb. One wrong word and I’ll explode. Don’t worry though, after I explode I immediately hate myself and want to die even more, so I leave because I hurt you and I’m a monster and you don’t deserve to be friends with a horrible person like me. 

Anything I say, I immediately regret. If I tell someone something about myself I get mad at myself because they might use that against me later. I’m afraid of telling people things about myself, they might use it against me or hate me for it. I don’t want to be hated, I want to be accepted. 

I’m sorry for saying I like apples, I was joking; I would never like apples. Do you not hate me anymore now? I’ll never eat apples for you if that’s what it takes for you to love me. Please just don’t leave me, I’ll do anything for you not to leave. Please don’t leave.

Please.

I don’t want to be alone. I’m afraid of what I’ll do to myself. I’m afraid I’ll take it too far one day. I’m afraid of overthinking myself to death. I’m really afraid of my thoughts. I’m afraid of me.

I don’t really see a future for myself, but if there is one for me I hope I’m not like this anymore. This mentality has stripped me away from the fun people my age experience. It has robbed me of a happy life. All I want is to be happy, but if I can’t see it in my future what should I do?

This is how I think. This is my everyday thought cycle. This is why I think I’m a horrible manipulative monster. My thoughts put me in a place where I’m forced to believe I’m a monster. This is my hell of a life. All I want is to be rid of this, either by dying or getting help somehow (if that’s even possible). The dying choice seems a lot more possible and easier.

179,"I feel guilty almost every single day, and it weighs me down quite heavily because guilt, as one may already know, is a very strong emotion. Often times, I feel guilty whenever I take the time to express how someone's words hurt me, especially when the person whose words affected me deeply happens to be a family member of mine. 


Perhaps I may be in denial but I can't stop myself from shifting the blame to me rather than accepting the fact that some people like my loved ones who've kept me in their care for several years, can in fact hurt my feelings sometimes. I blame myself for not being good enough, for upsetting them, for being hurt by their words and for anything that causes me pain because I hate myself far too much to be able to believe otherwise. 

I feel guilty for not being better, for not being enough, and this guilt makes me feel very heavy to the point where I can't breathe without feeling pain because my heart hurts. Sometimes I feel like screaming though I rarely talk and my voice barely reaches above a whisper on the daily, sometimes I feel like I might just loose myself and do something when the guilt gets too much. 


I can't talk about how I feel to my friends because I only have one legitimate friend and i've already burdened her far too much and I don't want to end up being toxic by troubling her with my concerns when she probably has just as much to worry about in her own life. 

Everywhere I look, I just feel alone, the people that i'm supposed to be able to lean on are the people I can barely even look at in the eye. Still I dream of a day where I can just break down infront of someone, I feel bad because that would be very burdensome, but I still wish to have one person in my life that can see the true horror that lives in my soul because I can't hold all this pain and grief forever. For now i'm alone, and though many people may say otherwise, they often don't know what they mean by saying that. 

Pointless words and repetitive advice won't change the way I think, but it would make me quite a terrible person to tell that to people when they do so, right? 

Aha, I hate myself, I wonder if my mother and father would shed tears if they knew how I felt. Is that even possible? Would they actually feel such emotion if they were to know? It doesn't matter either way, they'll never know, and I know that. For the rest of my life I will forever be a disappointment, though they don't say it, I can see it in them that they're disappointed at how their beautiful and lively child grew to be nothing but a blank being who barely opens their mouth to talk. 

I will never be someone who they can be proud of, and that makes me wonder why I need to exist.

Unfortunately I haven't found anyone that suited my requirements but I might have to go back to the place I had been previously - they weren't horrible, I just had a bad reaction (uncontrollable crying while talking about childhood) to the two sessions I had with a new psychologist and I couldn't handle it. My first psychologist was at the same place which helped me for the few months I saw her before she had to stop seeing me so she could help hospitals for COVID.

I've been feeling off since yesterday and while taking a nice bath my depression hit me. I started having thoughts of self harming (last done in May when I saw the psychologist and previous time before that was 7 years prior) and just worthlessness. Plus I had thoughts on why should I bother getting help and just how pointless it is to be alive. The thoughts of self harm overpowered me and I self harmed and I really want to continue it (it's getting hotter here in Australia so I can't hide like I did in May). I want to harm my arms but there is only so much I can hide with bandaids while being in a short sleeved shirt. My thoughts on why should I bother being alive are still attacking me while I write this.

I'm trying to figure out if I should go to work tomorrow or try and get an appointment at the old office where I had my previous psychologist appointments tomorrow or Saturday. My heart is going crazy right now as I always stress over calling work to say I can't be in.",12Nov2020,1

184,"So for quite some time 4 years to be exact I haven't really enjoyed life and with a whole lot of negative thoughts that run through my mind almost 24/7 and to clarify they are mainly suicidal along with the fact I'm a failure undeserving of my friends and always feeling empty like there was something missing in my life. Now! time for my question! my father was murdered last month and for the first time in many years, I cried. I chose not to talk to him for 5 years because the life he chose was that of alcohol and drugs and I knew that life isn't something I wanted to be apart of and I don't regret that I wasn't close with him but after his death, these thoughts that I've had seem to have for the most part left... and the feeling of emptiness also seemed to have left... but I'm not necessarily happy either I'm just kind of here and I'm wondering if this is common at all?",12Nov2020,1
185,"I'm about to turn 21 and I want to become a better human it's got to the point where I don't even want friends anymore, I literally broke up with all my friends because I would let people come into my personal boundaries. I never stand up for myself so it leads to this build up resentment so I wouldn't talk to people for weeks due to frustration. Despite people describing me as sweet??? I never really know to express emotion. And try my best to avoid confrontation and any kind of communications even healthy communication. So it leads to blow ups. I let the people around me dictate my emotions and value. I learned that I'm toxic and i think I want to spend a year without friends and find myself. Spend year finding my own voice without outside voice. I also have a lack of self discipline. But I'm worried that I wouldn't like myself very much. That being more self aware will truly make more open to even myself than I ever was before.",12Nov2020,1
186,"I'm 16. I suffer from Anhedonia and have all the symptoms of depression and anxiety with my doctor referring me to 3 different mental health services I've been passed around without any proper assessment. The same doctor didn't know I was suicidal so he says it's likely I do suffer from both due to chronic stress and trauma. 
I used to talk to a teacher about my problems after I started back in August as I was almost gone. I gave myself two weeks and if I couldn't get help I was gonna commit. I don't have much support as most problems stem from my home environment. I was told if I told a mental health professional I could tell her exactly the same as it was being dealt with. About 2 weeks later not understanding the severity of the situation I was taken out of my home as social work assessed my situation and I was told I wasn't allowed to talk to my teacher. After this my mental health started to get worse. I didn't have any support and the school have given options of pastoral or head of year who had both handled bullying situations really poorly. They practically allowed me to be Verbally, Physically and cyber bullied. I'm not going to talk to them and I'm not allowed to talk to anyone else in the school. Is this allowed?",12Nov2020,1
187,"This is a vent/help me-combo.
I'm a 19 y.o guy.

When I was twelve, I was diagnosed with epilepsy. I was given medication and I think it's destroying me. In fact, I think it HAS destroyed me to a point that it'll be very hard to fix. The first 2 years after diagnosis I had to switch back and forth with my medication, since it didn't work sometimes. I've had many different kinds; Depakine, Lamotrigine, Keppra, Clobazam and another one I forgot. At the moment I'm finally stable for a year and a half on Lamotrigine, Clobazam ánd Depakine. Judging by the side-effects list, I think the clobazam has been the problem for all these years. I feel lazy, unmotivated, pitied by everyone, insecure, very rarely but still suicidal thoughts and extremely tired. I'm scared to quit it however, because after being seizure free for 1 year I can drive a car. One seizure and the clock is back to zero.

All of this has terribly affected my life. My friend group shrunk from almost an entire classroom to about 4 people, because I didn't feel like talking to more people. My grades are suffering extremely because I need at least 2 hours to nap every day. On top of that, even though I try to study if I have a second of motivation, nothing sticks and I easily quit. I'm also extremely scared of failure and judgement, so I find it hard to ask questions. 

This all sounds like an irresponsible guy that's just looking for an excuse to not do his homework, but even other things I do to fill up my day seem too much work. Even ""relaxing but in a good way"" is too much work, and I'd rather just sleep. Paying attention to movies and music is something I can manage sometimes, but gaming, something that used to be my favourite thing to do, is a chore.

I'm also very scared of some of my thoughts. Before I go to sleep (at night this time) I always think about something like ""what if I just jumped out the window?"", ""how would getting hit by a train feel?"". It's not like I want to do it, but I'm scared that someday I really might.

I've tried so much... I meditated for months, tried to exercise, ate healthy, it just doesn't work. Whether that's mindset or a problem, I'm stuck with it. 

The hard thing about this is that I would love to go to a psychiatrist, but I have a hard time talking about my feelings, plus I will have to tell my parents (they still control my insurance by my request). They've been saying it's a phase for years and blow me off whenever I get the courage to ask them about it. 

I wonder if redditors can give me some good advise, and maybe tell me what exactly is going on.",12Nov2020,1

189,"My growing up was at the times when my parents bankrupted and went broke, and they were always crying and were full of fears, especially my father. When he was down, I always tattered him, and I felt like when I was around him he really adored me, even spoiled me, and I helped him to battle his depression and anxiety.

Now I have a lots of anxiety and fear myself. I have problems expressing my emotions, feel inadequate, have a fear to get contact with people, fear of jobs and authority, fear of girls, fear of everything. I feel I start to mimicking my father and dont know how to change it.

He was not abusive father, so it is not more often case than it is as abusive father. He was really submissive and I think this messed me up.

Can anyone relate to this?",12Nov2020,1
190,"I'm not bad at school. I like going to school (generally, when I'm not having an anxious or depressed day), and I can get okay grades just by being present. But I also have this unrealistic expectation on myself to be the best at everything and to be the most organized person and to just basically be a prodigy. 

I'm currently studying to become a laborant/chemist, and that's all well and good. But when it comes to the theory and general classes like english and math, I just feel like I have to be the best and that I have to always be studying and getting the best grades. There's no reason for this, because I could easily pass school by just arriving at school, but sometimes even that feels overwhelming because of my perfectionism. If I could just give myself some slack and admit that I am good enough just by doing my homework and studying a bit before my exams and just going to school and existing, that I am good enough to just exist!... I think my life would get a lot easier. Rant over.",12Nov2020,1
191,"My name is Max (14m) and my mom keeps yelling at me no matter what I do, she's always so mad at me for example today I went to the school nurse and said that I wasn't feeling well and if she could give me a pain killer (idk what it's called in English) but she calls my mom and my mom gets mad at me infront of the school nurse. And then my mom deicide that I should go home but I said that I can try to continue with the day and then she snapped at me and I just feel so bad, am I doing something wrong?
Do I deserve this?

And she's mad at me all the time and it rly isn't helping my depression and suicidal thoughts, always hearing that Im doing something wrong or getting yelled at",12Nov2020,1

I decided I’d like to eat breakfast this morning, which I usually skip. It’s the perfect weather outside (raining) and I thought that I could have a little pocket of peace in the morning before online school starts. I thought I’d read my book leisurely next to the sliding glass door with my tea, doesn’t that sound nice? But... my dad heard me come downstairs for breakfast, and now he wants to spend time with me.

196,"*TW* SUICIDE

This is going to sound so pathetic and selfish, but it's my 30th birthday this week, on my birthday last year I attempted suicide, as I just felt like I couldn't carry on and that I have just nothing to show for my life.

This year, after a stay in a MH Unit for a few weeks and getting my job back, I was starting to feel ready to live again. Earlier this year, some friends had even offered to host my birthday in their house, and have my first birthday party ever! I was stupidly so excited.

But then covid, and I live in the UK and the country has gone into lockdown again, so I will be spending it at home now, with no plans. And I think I really needed the distraction of a party, I know this sound so incredibly self-centred, but without the birthday distraction and something to look forward to, that's all gone, and I'm starting to have the suicidal thoughts creeping back in.

Sorry if this sounds insane, I just sort of wanted to write it down.",12Nov2020,1
197,"It’s really kind of stupid and that’s the frustrating part. I’m tlaking about like... when I see cute animals (especially my kitten who has caused a wave of weird guilt and anxiety on and off for no reason but also just my adult cats eating from
Their bowls is enough to set it off) or if I see somebody eating alone or Im eating alone it makes me just feel really awful and overwhelmed. Google says it’s somehow a good feeling and normal but it’s almost suffocating usually and if I can’t force myself to stop thinking about it I’ll get so overwhelmed I start to actually cry and feel miserable over such really stupid menial things.

It doesn’t feel normal to me and it’s on a few occasions made me suicidal and I don’t know how or if I can even stop it from happening. It’s a really bad feeling and I feel like I’m just insane because nobody else experiences it as far as I cN see. 

Does anyone have advice on how to manage this.... would antidepressants or anxiety medication reduce this? I’ve been on and off them forever for depression and anxiety and PTSD symptoms but they’ve all failed from
Bad side effects and or that they made me very numb and apathetic and constantly suicidal in a really indifferent way and it scared me. I feel just really hopeless especially because it’s seasonal depression season and I’m having. A really really low streak. I just wish I could stop getting so overwhelmed its like everything in my life has to be one of two extremes... and im really tired.",12Nov2020,1
198,"Let me give you a short background. A great deal of my childhood was spent in my bedroom hiding and crying because my parents were screaming at each other. I wanted them to split up so bad. I believe this is what started the anxiety and depression issues I've been struggling with since about the age of 7. [My parents were only affectionate towards me. I got high5's at bedtime, no ""I love you"", and rarely hugs (as an adult they tell me they love me on my birthday through social media. Never in person.) I know I have the ability to do the same, but it is an awkward situation for me. I can also make an entire thread on issues I have with my parents, but this isn't the time.] As you can imagine I never got the sex talk. When my peers started talking about sex and relationships I knew I wanted tons of it because my parents didn't have any and I didn't want to be miserable in my relationships like them. I wanted to learn everything. At 11 I met a boy that I fell in love with. He wasn't attractive and he was one of the fattest boys at school, but I knew I wanted to hear his laugh forever. We became best friends and very shy first loves. It never went past kissing :) My mom would snoop through my room and read our notes to each other and instead of talking to me about relationships she would get mad at me and ban me from talking to him. Eventually he thought I was crazy and didn't understand why I couldn't talk to him so we broke up. I was devastated. I lost my virginity at 13 to a boy I had feelings for and 2 weeks later he tells me he just had sex with one of my friends and that he wants to be with her instead. After that my self esteem was pretty damaged and I would always have a boyfriend with the potential of things moving forward. When I was in my high school years sometimes I would have more than 1 boyfriend at a time. I was good at being sneaky. I met my now partner of 15 years in high school, but he wouldn't take interest in me until after high school. When I turned 18 I moved in with him and we stayed busy working and during our free time recreational drugs (nothing serious). I got pregnant at 19 and he told me he wanted me to have an abortion. I was afraid of losing him, but didn't want the abortion. I knew I wouldn't have support from my family so I went through with it. I have struggled with that choice and was unsure of him as a partner for a while. I cheated on him multiple times and he knew. I apologized and he would take me back. We finally did have a child at 25. We both love her to death. Things had been going great and I had remained faithful. We decided to have another child 4 years later. We had a busy life. Work, sports, and we also found out our now 1.5 year old had severe autism. My partner shutdown on me. We were having sex about once a month, but that became less frequent and he would say he wasn't feeling well or he needed to shower (but wouldn't for days on end). He started helping me less with the kids, not helping with chores at all, blaming me for not getting things done or for the kids being too loud. Snapping at the kids. I was completely hurt. We didn't talk to each other much and the romance had been gone for a long time. I went to a doctor Oct 2019 and they diagnosed me with severe anxiety and clinical depression, which they gave me meds for. I was so happy that the meds took away the feeling that I was dying.  Last Jan I planned our first ever family trip (Disney). He told me he didn't want to take part in the planning and that he will just be where he needs to be. Well when we were there he just wanted to be with the smokers at the smoking section. My feelings were hurt. He didn't care about any progress our son was making or his therapy sessions. When school went online I had to stop working (even though we had opposite schedules and nice bosses) because he didn't want to help the kids. I was putting in so much effort while he would sit on the couch saying he was depressed. I encouraged him to go talk to someone and that I couldn't deal with it. I needed his help so much. I spent many night up thinking and crying. I felt like he was a stranger. It didn't help that at this time without me working I couldn't afford my meds and decided to stop taking them at once.  2 more months go by and things were getting worse. I made an online dating profile on a Sugardaddy site in May wishing for a prince charming to save me. I never perused anyone and I decided to work on my relationship. No matter how hard I tried it wasn't working. I wanted everyone to be happy. I knew at that point exactly what I need in a man and when I started seeing posts in late Sept. from an old love and I knew right away that he is my perfect man. He is a family man, but never married and no kids. He talks about his feelings and has a positive outlook on life. He was always one to take me out of my comfort zone and try to get me to talk more when we were younger. We started talking as friends, but that didn't last long. I was already crazy about him. I tried breaking things off with my partner, but he didn't take me seriously. I even told him that I didn't love him anymore and I didn't know if I could feel romantically about him again. I agree I should have told him flat out I was talking to someone, but I knew if I did he would make me leave and my kids would hate me. I felt like I needed to see this other man in person to really know if there was a connection and there sure as hell was. We ended up having sex, too. My partner finds all of this out and is now wanting to change and me to get therapy. I am excited to start therapy, but wish he would as well. He refuses to. I agree I have a ton of underlying issues that need to be resolved, but do you guys think this is worth repairing? What are some cheap options for therapy? Has anyone else been through something similar and what was your outcome?",12Nov2020,1
199,"I’ve noticed recently that when I go to talk, I will go to speak and my brain just shuts down and I’m just left with my mouth open. It’s almost like I get paused for a few seconds and my brain kinda feels like scrambled eggs. I already know what I am going to say, but I can’t say it in the moment and I’m grasping for what I was going to say. I’ll be able to say what I was going to say after 10-15 seconds. I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder and am currently undergoing exams, so it could be a stress thing? Does anyone else get this and how do they manage it?

It was an everyday thing so it got to the point where I feel like just by looking at him he was like associated to the negative part of my brain. So now years later anytime he tries to talk to me I just can’t stand him. It’s gotten to the point where if he just knocks on my door it sends shivers down my spine and I get so pissed off. He and other people think that I’m doing it on purpose but I just can’t help it. There’s just like an urge that takes over me to act that way towards him.

201,"I just turned 17 this summer a while after graduating high school and I feel like going to uni right now is such a fucking waste.

All my life I've been really average, and I've spent most of my life battling (diagnosed) eating disorders and depression. I guess no one expected that much from me, but the fact that I'm younger than most of my school peers but not young enough to qualify as a 'prodigy' made me feel like I unnecessarily skipped out on most of the youth and fun in being a teenager. Like, it's a really lonely spot to be in– literally, nobody that I'm close with can relate, but nobody really feels bad because I'm not amazing either.

To get to the real meat of my problems– my parents and my sibling are really smart. They're all engineers and were definitely put in way worse situations during their academic years. Both my parents grew up poor (I feel that in itself encompasses many traumatic/disheartening experiences) and my sibling was battling culture shock, racism, an abusive partner and even drug dependence. So for them, it makes sense they were failing academically at the start of their university careers.

I, on the other hand, am an International Relations student (nowhere near as hard as STEM) who is living under my parent's roof with no food insecurity and no culture/weather shock/racism like my sibling. Perhaps the worst I have to deal with is LGBTphobia, but we're all mostly indoors anyway so it's nothing I can't stomach. I guess the 15 hour time difference with my online classes sucks, but as you can tell I am extremely privileged.

Yet I'm still doing so badly. I can't be motivated to do anything. I'm regretting even attending university this semester because considering my age and okay grades/etc from high school, I could have started next year with absolutely **no** negative stigma or drawbacks. Especially considering the fact that we're in a pandemic. I truly feel like a gap semester would have given me time to rest for a bit and adjust to the fucked up shit going on in the world rn– instead, I'm half-assing school and have barely any reason to.

I guess me being typed as subpar pushed me to want to graduate earlier, but the stupidity of that decision is catching up to me.

Everyone in my family is really 'logical' and can't really... deal with emotional expression, which is fine and I'm used to it, but I for sure can't go to them for help. I have no access to counsellors and therapists, and I can't depend on my friends or social media. How can I relieve my frustrations healthily?",12Nov2020,1

203,"I'm 18 for personal context and I have no idea what's wrong with me. Past year and even some years before this I keep going through this cycle of tripping and falling into ruts with seemingly no end. I'm all over the place and can't find a way to articulate what's happening. It seems I'm easily getting overwhelmed by things whether that's University work and life or just my own thoughts and me dwelling and strategically pulling out negative memories and experiences to force myself to feel worse. 

In-between these ruts I get huuuge careless bursts of energy where I'll listen to music dance about and be in the middle of nowhere in the dark at 3 in the morning. Or I'll be saying hello to everyone complete strangers who think I'm insane, I'll spam everyone in my contacts with things I'd NEVER say to them just cringe, I'll go running in the rain, run for a long distance again in the middle of nowhere, TRY to put myself in dangerous situations this way, daring myself to walk down dark alleys and just SEEEE if someone tries to attack me leave an assignment to the last hour just because I have no energy or motivation and dare to see how far I'll go, this doesn't sound normal AT ALL and it's even stranger writing this out cause I've not properly realised how odd it is. 

Then there are even stranger things like I'll just go out to buy something end up leaving last min so of course it's late at night, I'll be walking back carrying my shopping bags then just decide to SCREAAAAAM my lungs out. Just 2 days ago on this same day after screaming I went to the middle of a carpark and just sat then lied down on the road. I full on lied there absolutely baffled by wtf I was doing, but also not caring at all and doing it just cause and this confliction and confusion clashed and fought in my mind. Then last night I wear a full white paint suit with gloves and a mask, go out in public just cause, go into a random store bought a holla hoop, some plastic suit I didn't need a spray bottle some kitchen towels... Then I go into another store buy food all whilst wearing this rediculous outfit with a holla hoop around my torso and I full on start talking to the scanning machine making convo... Now let me try and be clear here, I knoooow the machine wasn't listening to me or that it wasn't alive, I knew what I was doing it was just ""jokes"" I guess cause I was in this careless mood I assume, but even so I felt a small rush like it was listening and alive. I don't hear things or anything like that I was purely just not giving two craps tho. But anyway I'm talking to this machine asking how it's day was how life is and people are looking at me like 👀👀👀👀👀👀, And I ask myself now, am I seeking attention? If so why? Am I bored? Lost? Have I actually lost my mind like is this it? Just like that? I have noooo idea. 

I keep overthinking things like getting incredibly stressed about simple things like a sarcastic comment someone makes like I bounced a bouncy ball at a flat mate we were playing catch and the ball hits them in the ear and another flatmate jokingly goes ""see all you do Kobe is hurt people emotionally and physically."" (She says emotionally because I never hear what people are saying always zone out on them and it sometimes frustrates them I presume idkkkk) but this simple and pointless comment felt like an EXTREEEMEE ATTACK on me as a living soul on the face of the earth, I had to go to my room later pretending I was going to shower or something and blast Beyonce singing ""The hearts that I've touched, will be the proof that I need"" (I was thinking about the music I make and what u post online to help people spread good energy) ""I WAS HEREEEEEE, I LIVED I LOVED I WAS HEREEEEEE... (All whilst singing in the mirror pretending I was singing to my flatmate who made the comment which everyone brushed over and to this second don't have any second thoughts on. 

Man there's so much more personal things I'm trying to accept about myself which come with another list of negative thoughts I purposely entertain. I just want to understand but as you can probably tell from reading this if you've somehow managed to do that, it's a whole clunk of mess, so what do I do bout it? Close off and do absolutely nothing as more things build up around me including responsibilities and all that crap.",12Nov2020,1
204,"Hi All

Just met my boyfriend after a long time due to lockdown, and I find him picking at my personal appearance and he's really rude and abrupt about it. he saw I had some dirt under my fingernails and said ""EWW, Why is there dirt under your nails?"" ""I told you to look fresh for when you see your boyfriend"" (He's said this a couple of times) And commented on my hair is greasy.

Anyway, I then tried to make an excuse as to why there was dirt there, said I was cleaning and stuff. He then went on to say ""Your arms aren't waxed either"" and lifted up the sleeve of my top and saw some hair. He said, ""What's this?"" ""I thought you had a shower last night"" ""From now on I want showers in the morning before you see me"" I was absolutely mortified and started crying saying why is he picking on my appearance? I said I don't pick on you saying why have you got a spot?""

He then said a woman should always look fresh for her man, and it's unattractive to have this. I felt so ugly but I was shocked at how he was looking at me like I was something he stepped in. He said I've let myself go and its a sign of depression, (I am struggling with depression atm largely due to self-esteem problems and issues with my home life) though he didn't attempt to try and ask how I am or why this is the case, just simply reported it as though it was an observation. This really hurt me because he does neglect my depression a lot/get really rude about it, and iv always thought its cos he doesn't understand but now it seems he can see I have it, just doesn't want to help? Am I right?

I am soooooo mortified from what he said about my nails though. He has made comments in the past though like ""I hate greasy hair"" and before I see him he always asks ""Have you had a shower?"" ""Have you washed your hair"" I'm so upset I feel so ugly and unclean, am I overreacting? I feel like he's watching me like how I look, I'm sure I don't smell bad? I wear deodorant, shower every night, keep my hair clean, change my clothes every day. Is he being mean?",12Nov2020,1
205,"First time on this sub but I was wondering if you guys might be able to help me.

My siblings and I have a rocky relationship with my parents that would take hours to go into fully. My sister has had worsening depression for awhile (undiagnosed because my parents think depression is fake), and so far they’ve only made it worse. I don’t want to go too far into her mental state, but Is there any online therapy or counseling that is cheap or free that I could help her find? She’s tried to ask them for therapy in the past but they refuse to let her. My sister doesn’t have a job, so if it cost money I’d have to find a way to pay for her.

Hey guys, I’ll try to keep this as brief as possible but I’m sorry if I don’t. This is very near and dear to my heart and I’ve been reluctant to post this..


I met my best friend about 2.5 years ago, and me having a psychology background (almost went to school for it) in that I’ve always loved and enjoyed learning it, very quickly realized that she was struggling with some very deeply rooted and major traumas that reflected themselves in her everyday perception of life and the way she acted; without her even realizing it.
She is a very sweet girl with such a big, loving heart and I try to remind her about how none of what she’s gone through is her fault &amp;amp; how it’s not at all normal (mainly so she understands what is &amp;amp; isn’t ok or acceptable.) And that, even though she’s allowed it in the past, is not acceptable in the way she’s treated as a person. She is the type of person to continue to pour out her unconditional love out to you. She is also the kind of person though that doesn’t like to sit in a ‘pity party’ but instead act strong and stand tall, which is why she had not really originally accepted the thought of a psychiatrist etc.

Fast forward to today, on the surface she is finally at a place where we can talk about her past trauma and abuse from previous disgustingly toxic relationships from past boyfriends, without her crying or falling into a deep state of depression. She no longer lets that be a negative focus in her life, &amp;amp; it helps her to have someone who genuinely cares, loves, and supports her and listens to her. But of course I am no expert and am seeking help with anything low cost or for anyone without insurance.

I come to this thread to ask HOW &amp;amp; WHERE can I get help or a therapist for her even though she doesn’t have insurance???

(Continued)
She’s contemplated suicide in the past and has come close one time. She used to cut herself and expressed to me how whenever she did so it would help her feel better because she’d feel she deserved it. It’d be an adrenaline rush that she’d go through to feel alive. She grew up under a messy divorce and would see everyday how an abusive father hit her mom etc. Naturally this reflected into her interactions with men since she also didn’t have strong parental figures in her life, in which at around about 14 years old she began dating older men in their late 20’s and early 30’s (similar to her dad’s age at the time). Her first boyfriend who sexually assaulted her and also emotionally &amp;amp; physically abused her, ultimately setting the precedent for her future toxic relationships. She experienced this without her realizing or understanding how it was wrong because of how young she was so it soon became her own normal.
I have helped her get far in this journey to the point where she no longer harms herself and slowly she’s been able to be more open and honest with me about what she is struggling with.
She half jokingly told me the other day how she can’t help being a ‘whore’ (she expressed that obviously it hurt if others called her that, even thought she viewed herself that way, so it was only ok for her to call/refer to herself like that) because I mentioned how she enjoys having sex a lot. I jokingly called her a nympho which was when she explained to me that lowkey that’s why it was like a drug for her. because of that feeling of a man genuinely wanting and desiring her, she craves and desires that form of love and affection. But the reality is that most guys don’t actually want her, they want her because she’s a little easier to get to bed than most; so it’s superficially and hollow. Her self worth is extremely low and I really don’t want her to fall down a darker path because I really love her. You shouldn’t be loved or feel wanted because of what you DO for someone else or how you make others feel; you should be loved simply for WHO YOU ARE.

She is beginning to see her own self worth and not allow other guys to step on her in that aspect. The main problem now, is that I am afraid for her as she actively seeks a romantic spark, I don’t want her to continue to batter herself down by getting in and out of toxic relationships centered on sex and lust, not love and respect. I am working with her and I am seeking help because I’m not a professional in this field, just a close friend.






Some background info:
So she lives at home with her mom and step dad but they either don’t have her under their healthcare, or mental illness isn’t covered under their insurance. She’s had to be very independent financially since high school and pretty much pays for everything herself, and is planning on moving out soon. I am willing to help her with costs or anything else that can get her to that next milestone in her treatment.

She sometimes has moments where she’s extremely transparent and herself and she’ll confess things to me. But then she’ll put up a front, disguised as a joke to move on or not focus too much on the topic. On one of these occasions she told me that she knew what her problem was:
She never received that affection a daughter normally receives from her dad throughout her childhood, and instead saw how he treated her mom.
She confessed this to me and also that she is always confused by me because I’m the only guy she’s ever met that has stuck around this long and genuinely cares for her &amp;amp; doesn’t objectify her, which is why she says she is really in love with me. That’s the reason why she falls in love so quickly with guys and why she always ends up falling into toxic relationships. 
She has told me this very recently but SHE DOESNT KNOW HOW TO FIX IT !!!!

She is at a stage where she’s told me she’d seek the help if she were able to or knew how to. I am actively seeking help for her on her behalf &amp;amp; she really needs the professional help. please. again, any information helps",12Nov2020,1
207,"So I'm from England, 22 and studying my 1st year at University doing Journalism &amp; Politics struggling to understand what is wrong with me as I debate on whether to drop out.

Recently, (let's say the past 2 months) I've felt incredibly stupid as though I've lost half of my IQ. I'm unable to concentrate at lectures or recall on what I have learned, feeling like a fool when I speak as my confidence on my ability to talk about subjects dissolves. I feel overwhelmed as three large essays sit ahead of me with vast amounts of reading required for each one. Yet I find myself unable to get through a single page. I have zero motivation.

 I have no interest in learning and even if I did, my inability to concentrate leaves me with the knowledge holding capacity of a sieve. Im spending my days in bed wanting to sleep all the time, as the little enjoyment I find is playing on xbox or dreaming, as both provide me with an escape from reality. 

Am I just to stupid for my course &amp; lazy? Or do I need to admit that I'm not okay and need to focus on my mental health. If that is the situation what do I do? Dropping out of uni seems drastic but maybe it's too demanding for me right now. Is there a way I can get myself out of this slump and start enjoying my subjects, learning to my maximum capacity again?

I've never opened up by my mental health so hopefully I haven't been to vague, any advice would be greatly appreciated.",12Nov2020,1

I am full of guilt, regret, fury, and grief, feeling like these years with her have been a scam like I have been used for her sole amusement.
And still, I miss her and have visions of us together, which is, in turn, making it harder to overcome my porn addiction (we liked each other sexually too), and in general, it makes me feel sad. Not even because I miss her but because I feel guilty about missing someone that discarded me when they didn't need me like a toy.

212,"I come from India, where mental health is treated as a joke. People love to show off that they care about others by posting it on their Instagram stories, but in reality, they hate negative and toxic people around. Every since I was a kid, I was taught one thing that you have to excel in academics or else you'll never get a chance which I think to some extent is true. But I have been doing that from a very long time; my parents enrolled me in a coaching institute from 8th grade onwards because they thought it'd help me prepare for the IIT exam. To some extent it did, I worked my ass off for those 5 years and sacrificed every possible form of enjoyment thinking that college will be a place to relax and do things at my pace and landed up in a good college. I was so wrong; when I entered college, I found there's another race that I have to run, and that is, getting a good job offer. As usual, I again sacrificed everything and worked hard for 5 long years, and I finally got a good job offer, but then COVID happened, and I lost it. Like any other individual, I motivated myself to work again, sacrificing every bit of my social life, and after 8 months of working hard with no results, I give up. I don't want to breathe a tiny bit of oxygen anymore. I have lost everything, and nothing good will happen now. Any positivity I see on the internet seems like a toxic positivity to me.

214,"Hi, I’m not sure how to position this so thank you for your patience in reading.

Over the last few years I’ve started to feel as if my mind is more and more unstable. I used to be able to read a book no problem, I would get on with tasks like cleaning the house, cooking myself food, showering, making my bed etc

I would be able to get my head down with work and figure out difficult problems (I work in IT if anyone was going to ask) 

But now, I struggle to concentrate, I find it difficult to even leave bed, I put off every task and I only do a half job when I actually do (eg I’ll put clothes to wash but won’t hang/fold them and put away, I struggle to maintain a single line of thought and I’m constantly darting about in my mind. I find I’m always thinking about every detail and over analysing things. Not in an overthink, anxious sort of way but for example, if I listen to music, I never just let myself listen and just enjoy, I’m listening for every little detail, every note, every detail that could have gone on when being produced.

Same with films or any other media, sport etc

I also find I always ask and like to find out about all the little details of people, every possible nugget of information. Never to use against them or to ever gossip with but it’s almost as if the more I know about people, the better I can understand them, their influences, what makes them tick and why they act the way they do (the good and the bad things, no judgment either way) 

I know I exhibit some spectrum traits but I’m very confident that I’m not actually on the spectrum in anyway. 

But more and more I feel like I’m more erratic and just struggling with life

I try to make sure in some ways the factors that can make depression worse are handled, eg I don’t drink alone, I have a decent job, I have good friendships and a good relationship with a SO but there are definitely some anxieties that I have little control over (which I feel are rational to be worry/concerned about)

But even when I cover those bases, I still will spend hours in the morning doing nothing but the endless scroll of Facebook/Reddit etc or going down a rabbit whole of YouTube, looking up ‘interesting facts’ etc And I know I’m stagnating because of it.

I worry that in another 2-3 years I’ll have wasted even more of my life going nowhere, be more miserable and reduce my opportunities to progress 



Sorry for such a rambling post, 
I guess what I’m really trying to understand is how can I change this, I overthink things to a point where I understand the mechanism as to why actions work eg tidying your room, making your bed, eating healthy, going to the gym etc and it feels like I’m aware I’m taking a placebo 

TL:DR
I feel emotionally and mentally unstable, how can I address this?",12Nov2020,1

Hi everyone

Sorry for my english, it's not my first language but anyway

Since August i've been feeling lost in life. I'm currently 18yo and I feel like my life is getting worse and worse every new month.

I am from a third world country and my parents gave me the opportunity to go and study in France. I got accepted in a good university. HOWEVER. I didn't really choose this university because I was convinced. After graduating from High School I didn't even know what the fuck I wanna do in the future ? I have no idea about what studies I wanna do, and the more time passes and the more I think, I noticed that I wanna follow my passion. Like college and every academic thing doesn't fit me AT ALL, i have a good amount of followers on insta and Youtube, I have a drawing talents and I thought that one day I could do commissions with them

But like seriously, right now we are in lock-down, and I'm losing interest in studies, i don't know how to explain but I really feel like I'm not made for this. I actually DON'T want this, i don't wanna have a degree in something that does not interest me at all, I don't wanna keep on studying things that are 90% useless and the 10% useful skills I can learn them on my own, I plan on dropping out of college but if i do i must go back to my third world country (and i don't want this cuz it will be hell, we don't even have paypal there so how could I even start my own business or gain money with youtube ?).

I went crazy, I started to think that I need a european citizenship (Germany/Belgium or anything else) but you need to be there for 5 years to actually get it, so I thought of like start making money and rent in any country that would seem good to me for 5 years, that will be a big investement, or look for a girl that could love me and that i could love her and marry her so I could have the citizenship way easier and be happier atleast right ? I'm really depressed. I'm currently succeeding in what i am doing with my passion and letting down the studies that I AM NOT EVEN interested in, i don't even know what to do, i feel like life is showing me signs like everything happening right now is a disavantage for my studies and an advantage for me to keep rising

I'm sorry for my bad english.. I need help. I even think that suicide might solve all of these problems I don't wanna go back to my country and see everyone in the family disappointed while it is not really my fault because I hate what am I doing and it won't add anything in my life, i'm lost.",12Nov2020,1

223,"First off, I know it would be impossible to say for sure whether someone has an eating disorder without formal diagnosis; but I just wanted some others thoughts as this is driving me a bit loopy trying to figure out if I need to do more than I'm currently doing to help him, and I can't get clarity from being so close to the situation. 

Background: 

5 years ago my boyfriend was chubby (in his own words). The types of food he used to eat would be bland, like rice or bread or doughnuts and he didn't enjoy eating vegetables. All of this made him fairly unhealthy and slightly overweight. Although he did exercise sometimes it wasn't very routine. 
Then around 4 years ago he started to eat vegetables, got into salad and had more rounded meals. At this time he also joined a sports team, which meant he was exercising intensely a few times a week. 
He grew very involved in this team and over the next 2 years would spend 3-4 evenings a week training. This is where his relationship with food started going downhill from what I can tell. 

He worked out intensively and would sometimes compete, for which he would need to ""make weight"". This often involved him needing to commit to a weight (around 62-65kg/ 140-145lbs and he is 6ft tall). He would spend months on a strict diet where he would not allow himself treats and would go to training for 4 hours and come home and have a cuppa soup of like 200 cals. He got down to 60kg/132lbs at one point- he looked awful and could not perform well because he wasn't fueling his muscles. 

Fast forward to today: 

He is no longer part of the sports team and admits when he was that his relationship with food was put of whack; but he still exercises intensely. He does some sort of workout every single day. 
What worries me most is that he follows a very strict ""intermittent fasting"" protocol Monday to Friday where he doesn't eat until dinner time. He usually does a workout in the morning (30 min run or similar), goes to a full day of work and doesn't eat anything until 5 or 6pm. 

When I ask him about this he says it gives him ""mental clarity"" and other people are ""weak"" for not being able to do this. The other night he did confess to me that he does this in order to shut off the part of his brain that thinks about food, because outside of fasting time he said he spends around ""50%"" of the time thinking about food. (I told him I only think about food max 20% of the time and that is my ""normal""). 
In the evenings he often binges and is not mindful about what he eats. Although he claims to be in total control of his eating through fasting I actually think he is a bit out of control. 

Other point to note: 
He HATES fat people. He thinks anyone who is fat is lazy, incompetent, ugly. He actually makes comments about overweight people we see in the street which is so embarrassing and unnecessary. 
To him, being fat is one of the worst things you can be. 
He's even told me he might not find me attractive if I gained weight (I'm 55kg/120lbs and 5ft 2). 

We've talked about his relationship with food on occasions and he usually doesn't admit he has a strange relationship with food. He takes any opinion on fasting or restricted eating and uses it to bolster the argument on his choices, but that just seems like confirmation bias to me. 

Your thoughts and opinions are appreciated as I want to do the best for him! Thanks",12Nov2020,1

225,"Whenever things are going well (or I’m assuming they must be going well not sure how many things were falling apart at that moment and I didn’t notice, for e.g the pandemic, being stuck at home) I find a reason to lash out on the people closest to me for the silliest reasons. I’ve also observed that I set myself up for disappointment because I attach a very specific emotional reaction expectation from my close ones and when they don’t react the way I hoped they would I start to point out flaws in them. I’m a junior in college and have had A LOT of trouble making close friends ever since I started college because everyone I spoke to I deemed them unworthy of my emotional investment and was scared to be getting into a lasting friendship. I would really like to seek help in figuring myself out, I don’t want to drive everyone that cares about me away.",12Nov2020,1
226,Because I have a routine and go to work and school and do what I need to do my depression isn’t being taken seriously. There’s always this chronic lingering sadness going on inside. I have no energy and I feel wiped out after everyday even if I haven’t done much. Literally feels like I’m hanging on by a thread. The motivation to get out of bed and shower and go see friends is very very low. If I can be alone doing something that doesn’t require much thought or energy ( like watching movies in bed) is rather do that then see my friends. If some one offered me the choice of going to Europe or book a hotel room and be alone I’d choose the hotel room. Obviously there’s a lot more going on but I can’t think of everything now and it would be too much to type out.  Makes me feel so alone does anyone relate? What’re you’re experiences?,12Nov2020,1

But now, my dad and stepmom got me convicted of a crime I didn't commit. It being my first offense, and being a minor, the court is deciding whether it would be a better idea to keep me here, getting outpatient therapy, or put me in residential treatment for my trauma. I personally think residential will do more harm than good, but they won't really listen to my opinion. So, if I do get sent there, do they release me when I'm 18?

230,"I always knew it was fucked but like, when you're a kid it's just like ""I guess this is supposed to happen uh"" and when you grow up its like oh. Oh it absolutely isnt.

My parents always had fights. I'm still hate loud noises and I'm scared of men screaming. One time I even scared myself. I remembered dad once hit my sister, but I didnt know when he was confronted with it he said ""she hit me first."" Its just I can't even fucking imagine thinking that when he was like what, 45? And she was 12? How can you think its justified. 

He used to not let my sister sit in dinners with us. I remember not liking dinners becasue they were awkward, but I never remembered he did that. And it honestly explains so damn much, like all 3 siblings turned out either agnostic or atheists, and I remember the first time I had a sabbath dinner with normal people my first thought was like ""oh. This isnt so bad."" And like, when no one is yelling or complaining every second no wonder things arent so bad.

I'm just overwhelmed I think. I never really got this deep into my past with a therapist because i was like ""I cant remember most of it but what's the point"" but now I cant help but think I was such a sweet sensitive kid and they fucked me beyond belief. I just dont get why they bothered creating me just to act like shit and turn an already (honestly born mentally Ill because genes suck) anxious kid and yell and make it all worse.

And its obvious to me neither will admit the blame. Dad still fights with my older brother and it makes me anxious. Mom can admit the fuck ups dad has but wont admit she had a hand in it. Everyone just blames the other and my whole childhood was a shit show. And now I'm left with years of therapist sessions to pay, a fucked up view on family, and crippling social anxiety. And the only thought that comes to mind was ""why did they even bother in the fucking first place""",12Nov2020,1
231,"So when i was 19 i had a panic attack which led to anxiety that affected my daily life. Basically sleep, appetite etc. went to a psychiatrist and was told i have anxiety/ocd. Taking couple meds for it but symptoms return maybe once every two years after a stressful event. It seems like that stressful even can trigger a change in thought behavior which makes me focus more on anxiety. Eventually this goes away and im able to resume normal happy life. However, 3 months ago i had a couple of these stressful events which triggered my going into the anxiety loop. Im taking my medication however im still having symptoms. Mild restlessness, not comfortable, loss of enjoyment in activities, reduced appetite dont feel like eating as much. Feeling of dread in my stomach at random times of the day. 

Im not sure what to do. Ive tried coping skills tho not regularly at all. How does one overcome this. My therapist said do things you find fun and eventually your mind will readjust. However im not seeing much daily improvement. Is this a sign that i need to make some changes? Set new goals idk.",12Nov2020,1
232,"My boyfriend has been dealing with depression and anxiety for a while now and he’s been trying to find a therapist to help him with this. But every therapist he’s talked to won’t help him because he has an “addiction” problem. It’s not like he does hard drugs every day. He did acid last year and had a bad trip. He’s stopped drinking alcohol a year and a half ago. He has no present issues with drugs or addiction, he’s just trying to get help with his anxiety and depression. Why are these therapists not wanting to help him? It angers me because he doesn’t even do drugs or alcohol and all of these therapists are telling him they can’t take him on because of his drug and alcohol involvement! What is this nonsense? He has no addiction and these therapists are telling him he can only see an addiction specialist. This blows my mind, I really do not understand why they’re blowing him off.

234,"It starts Today. 

It takes Time. Something that I am Continuing to Learn is that the Process Takes Time. I Am always in the mindset of what has to be accomplished during the day that even if I am enjoying the Process, slowing down is what needed. It starts from the moment we Rise. As You. We are 1 of 1. We are Original. Irreplaceable.

  
Breathe. In. Breathe. Out. Enjoy this Day. Enjoy who You Are. Enjoy the Sunshine. 

  
With the constant time we have been given during this quarantine, it can be very scary or even puts your mindset to rush. To accomplish. Move on to the next, or that everything is too much that it makes us pause and stop. Either or is ok. Either or is still apart of our Journey. The Journey takes all different ways of balancing work ethic, our Mental Health, how we want to move forward.

  
It starts with Presence. It starts with being in the moment. Everyday for at least 30 minutes I get some sort of exercise, some sort of time in Mother Nature and Being Surrounded by Mother Earth, to let the calmness and embrace the fresh air and Peace that is constantly surrounding that can be easily looked past due to these unprecedented times. 

  
Social Media. A huge factor of changing the way I feel, act, think, Be. It is important to ensure that everyday I am taking time away for my own Peace and my own Well Being to make sure that I am focusing on my Self and Filling my Own Cup up, Rather than Emptying it onto Others. If There is no Marbles in the Jar for when I need them, how am I suppose to grab them? Anxiety, Depression, Lack of Presence, Lack of Self Identity, Lack of Being.

  
Today: Spend Time Outside. Spend Time away from your phone. Spend Time for You.

  
I love you.

235,"Things haven't been going well for me and as much as I have tried to comfort myself in various ways, my body is finally giving up on me. I don't have the strength to fight back anymore. I can't eat, sleep or focus on anything. This all might sound dramatic but this is how I feel. I've been going through a lot of mental distress due to college. I'm 18 years old and I'm in my 3rd semester of CS. Things have been really rough for me academically as well as socially. I'm a hard worker and somehow I've managed to do good in studies but it has been very difficult for me mentally. I've had countless amounts of breakdowns and I don't really have anyone whom I feel a special connection with to discuss my problems anymore. I'm so guilty to admit this. So many people that I love have tried their best to listen to me but in the end, I keep coming back to this. I'm just here to vent. I don't know what else to do. I'm in my bed, my body feels like it's shutting down. My heart is beating so fast that it's distracting me from other things. I can't sit in one place without fidgeting. I'm laying inside a huge blanket right now but my skin feels cold. I have so many people around but I can't seem to connect with anyone to discuss what I'm going through right now. To be honest, I don't know why this is all happening to me either. I can't even bring myself to cry. I just feel like escaping from my own damn body. My brain is telling me something terrible is going to happen. I feel like I'm in danger and my body is feeling so helpless and weak right now. I just feel like a lost and abandoned child thrown into a jungle. I feel so alone. Last night was really hard for me, I couldn't sleep and I was up till 5 AM. I ate my first meal at 8 PM today. I want a hug from someone without asking me what's wrong because then they wouldn't get it. I just don't know what to do right now.",12Nov2020,1
236,"It was a few nights ago. It was around 2 am. I was in my dark room having another anxiety attack and depressive episode.

I wasn't in the right state of mind. I was thinking of suicide. 

So I ended up asking my Google home mini ""Hey Google, what's the most quick and painless way to kill myself?""

In the clearest voice, I asked the same question ***3 times***.

Google's response: ""Sorry, I don't understand""

I was honestly shocked. I thought it would actually list ways for me to end my life and if it did, I probably would have been dwelling on them even more and attempting to try it. 

A few days later, I was in a similar situation. I was like ""Hey Google, I want to kill myself"".

Google's response was: ""You're not alone. Google some resources for help.""

Could this be a sign?

Also, while I'm here, I'd also just like to say that being appreciated and having someone care, even if it's just a tiny bit really gives me a reason not to kill myself. I have quite a lot of these people at my workplace who really appreciate my presence and are happy to see me. That is one of the main things that keeps me going and why I personally would rather go to work than call in sick when I'm not mentally ok.",12Nov2020,1

238," The emotional aspect of my life has been always a little wacky here and  there with weird quirks in my character. I am introverted and am really  focused more on what my mind speaks then what others trying to  communicate to me. So, getting things across when things are emotional  is difficult. I too went through some depression and also recovered from  it like a bouncing ball. One needs emotional intelligence and  resilience to go somewhat peacefully, joyfully, to the place we have to  go. It needs to be developed bit by bit over a period of a lifetime.

239,"It’s baffles me that there are so many people out there that have never once had a serious thought about killing themselves. How is that even possible. I don’t remember the last time I haven’t been even just a tiny bit suicidal in the back of my brain. When I’ve spoken to professionals before and said I’m suicidal but don’t have any current desires to act on it at all they never really understand. I have been very suicidal in the past and tried to act on it once so I know I can get to that point if I’m not careful. I have dreams about it a lot. It’s so embarrassing to say but I think my brain likes and craves the attention I would get if I actually did it. I absolutely hate attention seeking behaviour and people that are attention seekers. Like when I used to self harm I would hide it really well and I never wanted anyone to see it but there was also a small part of me that wanted people to see because of the attention I would get, I would sometimes ‘accidentally’ have slip ups, my sleeve would ‘accidentally’ roll up or something but if someone noticed and asked I would internally freak out and come up with every excuse I could. It’s like I wanted people to know but really didn’t at the same time. Some times I feel like my brain is obsessed with the ideas of self harm, suicide and mental health to the point that I feel like I’m making it all up and making myself worse on purpose. I love the idea of people thinking I’m crazy. Yet I do my best to make people think I’m normal. I don’t know what’s wrong with me",12Nov2020,1

246,"A friend of mine got out of a long term relationship. I've had a crush on her for years. I asked friends, and even on reddit what to do. The universal answer was to be a friend first. I went to her apartment. We talked. We caught up. I made sure she was okay, and I thought things went well. She mentioned ending the relationship voluntarily and seeing other guys. I mentioned something towards the end that I thought she was beautiful and wanted to spend more time with her. She smiled and gave a positive response. I texted her over the weekend about this minigolf place I found. She said it sounded interesting but she would under no circumstance go on a date with me.

The common advice has been to just move on...I can't. I feel emotionally devastated. I feel completely worthless. Minigolf would be nothing. It isn't a contract. It's just spending more time with me like we already have. It's just scouting. It's an interview. It's a test to see if we're compatible and nothing more. If she really hated me that much or thought I was truly ugly she could have said something all this time. If one of my friends asked me out, I would have no problem saying ""Oh, I won't give you a chance because of X. You need to do Y."" She didn't say that. She just universally said it would never happen without any reason. I feel like she said that because she thinks I'm below her. She was swatting me away like a pest she was annoyed at.

I haven't been able to get past this idea that I'm a broken person the last few days. If I open up online coursework, I just stare at the screen, unable to focus. Logically, this means I'm not creating value. I won't be able to build the value I lack. I just started a new job that has benefits. Once I'm properly in the system, I can see if therapy is covered and probably get this all sorted out. Until then, I still feel like I'm drifting.

But when I have a bad emotional episodes I always purposefully avoid things that I consider nice and good cause I'm afraid they would get spoiled. Not just in the moment, but permanently. Like if I once try to watch a movie right after the panic attack I will always associate this movie with the feeling of panic.
Basically if I'm able to control the environment and my behaviour at the moment of an emotional episode I just freeze and try to not touch things and think about things so the emotions won't stick to them.",12Nov2020,1

I was just wondering if anyone experiences this too?
So I've noticed this isn't just a thing with him it applies to all relationships. I can he very into someone imagining our life and when they suddenly break up I'm sad for maybe an hour? Then I go through my phone and delete every photo, their number and set fire to the things accumilated. I literally feel absolutely nothing. I have to just get on with life. I can do this with friendships too. I know as a whole I do not get overly attached to human beings yet I still want love. On some level I recognise I have been through heaps of trauma, dated god awful people who manipulated me, sexually abused me etc. So I get it is a defense mechanism.  
I also just remember when at uni a guy chasing me with a knife trying to stab me and when I told my friend she was more worried about my reaction. I just feel very eh whatever about the whole thing, still breathing so meh, right? I do understand on some level that might not be right.

With another lockdown in the UK I used to see my partner once a week but now not at all. Every day that passes I can feel myself drifting away. It's completely insane because when he calls I get butterflies again and when I'm with him I'm very happy. Perhaps even worryingly happy? I feel high and although I'm introverted I'm very loud and eccentric and sometimes borderline inappropriate? I have a family that does not know he exists because they are extremely controlling. I  know a part of me being really down is that I have to sneak around at home and I've spent a decade not actually being who I actually am.

Anyway, I told him and he wants to work through it I just don't know where to start. I can't just turn it off.

252,"Hello there people,

Firstly I want to introduce myself and give some background information. I'm 23M living in Germany. I come from a financially stable, christian, working class family but I'm atheist and am the first in my family to visit a University. I've completed my A-Level, I'm currently in University studying physics and I would consider myself as an extremely rational thinking person and science driven person.

So to begin with: I haven't feeling myself in the last 2 years. It's been a process in which my positivity towards things and the joy of doing things has been spiraling downwards gradually. I don't feel any joy, I don't enjoy things I enjoyed in the past and I just don't care about my surroundings and myself anymore. I see anything as a chore whereas in the past I would enjoy things. My sleep schedule is messed up, I can't motivate myself to study (I am in the process of dropping out of University) or even just do daily tasks.  
I just don't care.  
I wouldn't consider myself to be depressed or anything because I don't feel sad or angry, I just don't feel anything particularly. There are some things that bring short term joy but in the end I end up feeling nothing.  
I haven't showered in probably 3 weeks, I haven't shaved/cut my hair in a months, I sleep with my clothes on because I can't even go through the hassle of changing clothes. I sit in front of the computer and browse the internet and play games I used to enjoy all night long to just let time pass. I don't go out as much with my friends (I'm using Covid as an excuse to not go out for a smoke or whatever) and I'm at a point where I view going out with my friends more of a chore than something I generally would enjoy. My family isn't noticing any of this because we're all overworked and struggling because of the whole Covid thing and I really don't want to talk to them about it or to get them involved.

I'm at a point where I'm seriously asking myself what the hell is wrong with me. I've had a supportive family, great friends, no childhood or adolescent trauma or anything that might contribute to the way I'm feeling lately. I don't think that I need professional help but I'm weirdly starting to worry about myself because I'm starting to feel guilt and starting to dislike myself because of the way I currently am.

I don't know what to do because I'm really really struggling to sit myself down and start to fix this.  
Can anybody, maybe with a similar experience, tell me how to get out of this hole I put myself in.

Thank you for reading all this and trying to help, I really appreciate every effort.",12Nov2020,1

So here's the deal. Who know what's up. Been trying to stop self medicating, addictions helped a lot, but also didn't. So, been getting sober off a multitude of things. Had a bit of a breakdown when I discovered that I unintentionally killed the real me. I buried myself alive under layers and layers of ice.

So I drank again, to break the ice. It worked as planned, but the extremes returned.

Where is the balance? I want to feel, I want to be a human who builds from the dirt of the heart. Are my choices numbness or extremes?

After looking at the scale and hearing opinions about it with an open mind, I have concluded that it’s just... not a diagnostic tool and shouldn’t be used as one. The only way that scale makes any sense at all is if it is just considered a piece of interesting research and not a diagnostic tool. None of the trans people around me fit into that scale whatsoever; time has passed, language has changed, limitations on considering one’s own experiences have changed, and because of this a piece of research done 50 years ago is just... not going to work as an actual tool of categorization today. It considered exclusive attraction to cis men one of the main traits of an Actual Woman, and, let’s not forget, it only categorized trans women.

Many of the people around me that would be categorized as Type 4 by the HBS (due to bisexuality, gender non-conformity, lack of passing, using their natal genitals) are actually people that strongly desire SRS and consider themselves to already be members of the opposite sex. Where do you think this “fuck you, I’m already (blank), I don’t have to do jack shit in terms of transition” attitude comes from? You think it was started by people that just *want* to be the opposite sex/resemble the opposite sex and currently see themselves as their birth sex? No, it was started by people that view themselves as atypical members of the sex they weren’t born as- which is, according to people that use the HBS in modern day, a trait of a “full transsexual/true transsexual.”",12Nov2020,1

272,"My mother is 73, almost 74. She has had mental health issues my entire life but refuses to acknowledge that she has these issues because of cultural stigma (and perhaps because of the type of mental illness).

From online reading, I suspect she is bipolar, with a large dose of paranoid delusion. She has phases when she can't sleep and starts calling me multiple times a day asserting that ""they"" are breaking into her house again and stealing from her.  She now believes that her neighbor is part of ""them"" and is carting away hundreds of boxes of her things every day (her place is filled with boxes still from hoarding). She also has periods where she'll sleep the entire day away and be unable to cook for herself. She complains of cardiac issues, but despite repeat detailed tests, has never had an issue found. I believe it's anxiety causing her to experience sharp pain in her chest, because onset of symptoms is usually when she's stressed by her paranoia.

She currently lives alone, as I refuse to live with her, but her paranoid delusions are becoming worse since she's lost the majority of her eyesight in the last thee years due to glaucoma. I'm debating moving her into a semi - assisted living home, which is very expensive, but I would like to her to start treatment for her mental health before then, as I believe her issues will just transfer to the new location. She's lived in several places since I've left home, following me around the state, and in each place a new neighbor will start stealing from her.

Thank you all for reading in advance. 

I attend a local university and still live with my parents. 

To make a long story short, I've been diagnosed with deperession, anxiety, and panic disorder since the age of 14. I also started getting into drugs around that time and slowly but steadily developed a pretty bad drug problem by the middle of my sophomore year, which is also the year that I started experiencing suicidal ideation. 

This road hasn't exactly been an easy one to travel on, but I haven't used, nor been suicidal, in two years. My mother and my siblings overcame and got through a lot of horrible anxiety that was brought on by the possibility of my death, and they do not worry about me nearly as much anymore (in a good way, like independence). 

My dad is on the opposite end of the spectrum; he struggled with addiction when he was younger and has anxiety himself, and it’s probably been extremely hard for him to watch me go through this as not only his child, but his only son. We have an extremely close bond and I definitely inherited most of my personality traits from him. He recognizes this, but unfortunately he feels like his genetics caused some of my problems. He’s talked to me about it a few times. Nobody is responsible for any of my problems except for myself, and I have tried to assure him of that a few times. I love that man more than I can put into words; I couldn’t have asked for a better father. It’s horrible to know that he feels like he let me down when I see him as my hero. 

With all that being said, he still has extreme anxiety when it comes to me. He had a heart attack a few years back (genetic issue) and I feel like him going into these extreme bouts of worry is going to hurt him... he’s been struggling with panic attacks for awhile as well (which I’d imagine are not good for people who have had heart attacks). 

Just an example of what I’m talking about (last weekend): my parents and my siblings went away to our hunting camp for the weekend. I stayed home because I needed to work on assignments and the internet connection is unreliable up there. He called me 5 times on both Friday and Saturday, and each call was virtually the same. I was up studying pretty late Saturday night and I slept in til about noon on Sunday. I knocked my phone off of the charger while I was asleep. I didn’t naturally wake up at noon, though... my dad sent my uncle over to make sure I was alive. So yea, I was woken up by my uncle knocking on my bedroom door. When I got my phone on, I had 9 missed calls from my dad and a ton of texts. My mom told me he was worrying like that all morning and was having panic attacks. 

This guy deserves relief, man. I want him to believe in me and I want him to believe that he is the great, loving father that I know him to be. 

Is there anything I can say to help him? I’ve been thinking of suggesting a family session with my old psych... don’t know how that would work exactly. He definitely has some of his own issues but I know that he can find relief once he overcomes whatever my struggles caused him to feel.",12Nov2020,1

284,"Hey guys, 

two months ago, I experienced my first panic attack which kind of changed me as a person. To be more specific, it kind of fucked up my thought patterns. I‘m constantly ruminating about how I can‘t be in the moment, that I can‘t forget about the things that happened and how bad I want to forget all of it. Then I take a step back and try to understand what it is, that is keeping me from moving on, then I think things like: „I have to forget that I want to forget.“. And then that creates a endless circle of trying to find out what is actually wrong with me. And than I think that I’m trying to find out what‘s wrong with me is what is wrong with me. I always recall old memories of me and think about how back then my thoughts didn‘t just ran rounds all day. And how nobody in the world understands what I‘m going through. And all of these thoughts are the only thing keeping me from living life like before. 

I really don‘t know how to explain it to people in a way that is somehow understandable. I know I don‘t have a problem and just try to solve a problem that is not even really there and that is the worst part of it. 

I know it all sounds like it‘s not so bad but life doesn‘t really makes sense if you always feel like you are not in the moment. How should I go to university and learn things and reach my full potential if I‘m always in my head thinking about how I‘m always in my head? 

It seems like an unbreakable cycle because even I don‘t understand it and I‘m afraid I can never have the kind of thoughts I had like 3 months back. I‘m afraid that I won‘t be able to fully enjoy life as I once did and won‘t get a second chance from life. I’m afraid I can’t beat my issue as everybody and everything in life will constantly remind me of all of this and I don’t know what THIS even is. So how could I beat it? There is nothing I have to beat and if it‘s nothing that I have to beat, how can I beat nothing. It’s like having no problem and trying to figure that out is enough to destroy my life. I‘m so regretful and angry at myself because the panic attack which started all of this was drug induced, so it‘s all my own fault. This is the worst thing that has ever happened to me because it‘s keeping me from experiencing  real happiness or any at all tbh. 

I just wanna stop thinking about me and start thinking about things that are actually relevant. You know, a „normal“ person can sit in front of a friend and think about the things that are discussed. But not me. I‘m thinking about how I can‘t think about the things that are discussed. This is so paradox. 

So if anyone of you guys understands what I‘m saying, could you please give me some advice on how to move on and enjoy life again? How to not always think that there is something holding me back from fully paying attention? I get so sick of this, I just wanna sleep all day because I‘m still my old self in my dreams. 

Anyway have a good day, guys.",12Nov2020,1
285,"I have struggled staying faithful during a 15 year relationship. Most is from commitment issues from seeing my parents unhappy. Every time I am beyond frustrated with my partner I would seek attention from other men. This all stopped once we had our first born. Things were good until we had a special needs child and my partner shut down on me. He wouldn't talk to me, I was the only one taking care of the kids and household duties. He slept, watched tv, and played games. The kids and I were always told to be quiet and for the kids to go away to their rooms because they were bothering him. Things got really bad and our eldest started to get really upset. Reminded me of my childhood. I always wanted my parents to divorce. I tried talking to him many times about my feelings and how he was treating the kids, but he always had excuses for his behavior. I have been taking care of him every way except for financially. He also doesn't drive, so I go everywhere for him and go to all of the kids things alone.  It had been a lonely journey so far caring for my limited abilities child. During this solid year and a half of unhappiness I started talking to a man from my past (family friend of over 20 years) that I still have feelings for. I wanted to meet him in person to see if there was still a connection. At this point I know exactly what I need in a man and he has all of those qualities. We had sex that day. A few weeks go by and my partner finds out. I felt relieved that he knew because I really was happy. He tells me that he knows his actions caused that to happen. How I feel about it is that he knew about the things that happened in the past and the possibility of it happening again. Why wouldn't he talk to me about my feelings before I went to another man? He tells me he is changing who he is and how he lives his life and made me make a decision right there whether I would stick around and try to repair what we have as a family and block the man from my life and if not I have to move out. All I ever wanted was for him to change and be happy, but I also feel like he should have made an effort sooner. We both agreed I need to to to therapy. He doesn't think he needs to, but I think he should. What are some cheaper options for therapy? I see they have online sessions. Does anyone have any experience they can share? Also if I truly have feelings for this other man should I cut him out completely while I am seeking therapy?",12Nov2020,1
286,"Sorry if this doesn’t belong here, I wasn’t exactly sure where to put this but I wanted to talk about it a little somewhere.

I won’t go into too much detail about what happened between me and my parents because we’d be here for years with me explaining the multitude of stuff that’s happened. 

But basically, a few days ago I had gotten into a pretty serious argument with my parents with the topic being around my mental health (I would rather not go into too much detail but basically I’ve got alternate personality’s). Things got a little heated in the argument and I was told to leave the house and to not come back until I respected them.

Now my parents had never been the most supportive when it came to my mental health so I was pretty much left to fend for my self when it came to trying to keep my self upbeat. The last time I attempted to kill my self, I didn’t even bother telling them that I had done so until it was necessary because I needed a lift home.

So after being kicked out, I grabbed most of my important belongings such as: bank card, drivers license, wallet, phone, charger and earphones. I had told my brother just before things got massively heated that I might end up getting kicked out, so he was already on his way over.

Eventually he shows up and strangely enough, as do the police. No punches were thrown so I have no idea why they’d be here too. 

After chatting to them for a bit, I find out they’re here because my mum was worried that I would end up killing my self...I guess there’s a first time for everything, even if it is a mother caring for her son’s mental health.

Eventually they leave and I went to stay at my grandparents house for a night before then coming back to my brothers (where I currently am now). I didn’t have any plans to go back to my old house so I was already looking for new places to live however thanks to the combined searches of me and my brothers girlfriend, I’ve got a viewing and a potential room that I’ll be living in on Saturday! 

My brother said he could get me a job at his work which will be more than enough to help keep me afloat in the house along with a lot of extra money that I can use on other random things.

I’m amazing as saving money and at making sure I pay bills on time so that won’t be an issue for me. I’m feeling pretty motivated now and I couldn’t be happier with where I am currently. It just goes to show that sometimes it might not just be down to: “hormones and a bad experience” as most would probably say, it could be the very place you’re living in!

Tl,dr; my life was bad but now it’s good and I’m moving into a new neighbourhood",12Nov2020,1

289,"Preface:
(Going to separate into chunks because there's a lot, trying to make this as short as possible, I apologize.)
Last summer I moved halfway across the country to be with a man I'd met online and had never met in person. That summer with him was probably the happiest time of my entire life. I had never felt like a stronger and more productive woman. Fast forward to last fall and slowly I start to drift back into old hsbits and my old state of low self esteem and poor mental health that I was in before moving here. Slowly my happiness dwindled and eventually I ended up quitting 3 jobs in only the span of a few months because I was having severe anxiety in my work environments. When I was working my boyfriend sometimes had to literally drag me out of bed. When I got home from work I felt so drained I would immediately go to sleep and back to work the next day. My days off consisted of staying in bed to recharge. At this point after quitting my 3rd job it was around December and it was the first time my boyfriend said to me that he thinks I might be depressed or that there just isn't something right there mentally. I just kind of laughed it off because the people I grew up around made fun of overly emotional people. I also got incredibly worried he was just making fun of me. He wanted me to seek help but I had no part in it because of that worry, and that was the beginning to a horrible downfall. That cycle just continued, we got kicked out of our apartment by our roommate and had to move in with his family, he asked me to get help, I shrugged it off. I found a job, I quit. He asked me to get help, I shrugged it off.

Present day: 
For the past couple of months I have been jobless but have reignited a lifelong passion for art that I had lost last winter. I have been putting all of my time and energy into this passion as it seems like a sanctuary for me. The one thing that makes me happy. I very, very rarely leave the house let alone my room. And I don't really talk to anyone other than my boyfriend and sometimes very briefly his family and some old friends. I feel happy with what I'm creating and working on but at the same time I'm sad that I don't really have a life. 

My problem:
So here's what I've been facing the past few weeks maybe months.
Every time I have a conversation with somebody who isn't my boyfriend or is centered around something that aren't current world events (such as election results) shortly after or even sometimes during that conversation I will feel an overwhelming sense of de ja vu. It's to the point where if the conversation is over text or in a group chat I have to scroll back up or search in the chat to make absolutely sure the exact same conversation hadn't already been had. My first instinct when this all started was that my boyfriend and his friends where playing some cruel joke on me and that he was going into my phone and deleting messages from my end so I wouldn't know, though now and after locking my phone from him I do realize just how insane that theory sounds and I apologized to him. But yeah, every time is no exaggeration, it's happened with every friend I've talked to recently, my mom, my sister, my boyfriend's family. At first it started as just de ja vu from conversations but more recently it's been in some of my actions as well.
One friend in particular that I've recently got in touch with it's just about every thing we talk about. But I've scrolled through every conversation we've had and have found nothing. 
It's such a strong and overwhelming feeling that makes me question what's real and who's just messing with me and I still wonder if it's just an elaborate joke.
Has anyone else ever gone through anything similar or might have any idea what is causing it or what could help me? I would really, really appreciate it.",12Nov2020,1
290,"I am not well mentally at the moment. I am depressed, exhausted, aching. I am obsessing, overwhelmed and frozen. I am full of anger towards my existence. I have no appetite, I am sex repulsed, I am horrified at waking up every day. My 'impossible tasks' are growing insurmountable.  
My ability to functionally interact with other human beings is in total disarray. I tense and have surges of anxiety when someone approaches me at work, when my phone goes off, when I have to wait in my car to avoid having to be perceived by a neighbor in the stairwell. Just the thought of having face to face interaction with people is making me nauseous these last few days.

No, I don't think I can be helped.

Yes, I have tried or at least considered damn near everything in the past few months as this has progressively been getting worse.Therapy(can no longer afford), Meds(did more damage than good and also could no longer afford) Meditation, list making, self care, doing one thing, rewards, punishments, being social, forcing smiles, podcasts, books, herbs, teas, chocolates, yoga, going outside, vitamins, diet changes, literally everything that has been suggested I have given it a chance.

It's worse at work(I'm so vehemently anti-work, as a philosophy of life) and I feel like I will never have time or energy to heal or figure out what is wrong with me.

I’m going to be brutally honest.. growing up 17-21 I used to be the type to tell people to “man up”, I’m not proud of it but I always thought I was mentally strong and nothing really bothered me and people who couldn’t “man up” and get on with it were just attention seekers.. as life went on I got older, had kids, got a boring 9-5 job and lost friends along the way. 

I spend a lot of time on social media checking peoples profiles and lusting after things I will never have, whether that be material things or relationships. Everyones lives seem better than mine.. I was getting over feeling my like I was of lesser value than others as I started to takeup martial arts and was training 5x a week.

293,"I've noticed that often when ever I get in argument with people of same status as me (I'm a student, so not a teacher, but another student) or they pick on me, I can actually get enjoyment from it (re-reading it makes it sound like a fetish). Those people clearly dislike me but talking with them makes me like them more? An example is: Somebody once blamed me for something pretty bad and alot of people were picking on me for it. I actually got satisfaction from it, I found it thrilling and as I proved their dumbass's wrong I found it fun! I was eventually able to sort it out, ofc some little shts always remain but the incident as a whole was over. When those people blamed and cursed me I didn't feel revolted or scared, simply laughed, hence the feeling fun? Jobs such as a teacher or therapist (or similar things) have always attracted me because of the sense of superiority they give. Which made come to this conclusion: I have a need to feel superior (other instances support this idea) when people argue / pick on me I find it amusing / fun because their stupidity is amusing? For example, in cartoon shows when people get bonked because of silly things, I've never found it amusing as a little child, but applying a realistic representation of those things actually entertains me (I have a childish mentality perhaps)? Don't get me wrong I realise I'm not superior to anyone (I actually really support fairness (equality)) and sometimes I do realise I'm wrong in an argument, which I do admit, but in situations where it's clearly not the case I get enjoyment. This does however cause problems for me, arguments are unavoidable in life, and so are stupid people, I recently met one of these people, and after a series of events a conversation went like this:
Her: ""If I have a bf he must be smart""
And after hearing this come from such a stupid and annoying person who I actually detested made me snap, so I replied with:
""You are pretentious for a smart man yet you aren't yourself""

Ofc I agreed because (obviously correct thing to do) but the the happiness the argument brought was worth it imo (you might think it's because she ended up crying and leaving, satisfying a possible feeling for revenge but it's not the case since it's the process itself that was enjoyable). I mean I just wanted to share this quirk with someone out there and who knows, maybe they can help fix it, but just wanted to share it more than anything else.

295,"I am a French man suffering from Bipolar disorder and OCD and I wanted to know if there was a stigma surrounding mental health in your country?

I ask this cause it seems that having a psychologist, even when not suffering from a mental disorder, is considered normal in USA, whereas here, it's still very taboo and I to this day, I still haven't revealed what I am suffering from, to my close friends. 

And today I have come to realize that in the XXI century, it's now probably much easier to come out as a gay person than coming out as suffering from a mental illness. And if you calculate there are probably berweeem 10 and 20% of the general population who is mentally ill. It's not like we don't count. 

So when will our time come?

To make it worse, I am reasonably tall, have an ok face, followed by an athletic body, so people always assume I'm very healthy and they sometimes require things from me that makes my condition worse.

I don't wanna any excuse. I just want a little bit of understanding and compassion.",12Nov2020,1
296,"I really thought that finding ""my thing"" would help me manage my symptoms easier, but thats obviously not the case. 
I don't have an official diagnosis bc my treatments and evals have always been interrupted by things like moving between cities, so I can't get any assistance from my school because I don't have a disability on paper. I finally called the local health center for advice and apparently my answers to the standard questions were alarming enough for them to get me started with a therapist right away, so that's something, at least.

Last year was tough, but I still managed to stay afloat and pass my classes. This week, I couldn't even get myself out of bed for a zoom class I had actually looked forward to and prepared for on a good day i had while still high with hope from my first therapy session. I can't seem to ""just do it"" anymore, I haven't done any of the assignments yet this semester because of it. 

I hope that the therapy will lead somewhere, but I'm also afraid it'll add to my exhaustion, it is tough having to deal with all the questions, and it's hard to let go of tough subjects once they've been brought up. I'm also afraid I'll end up focusing too much on my school performance, and neglect looking at thing in a long term perspective. 

Hopefully it'll feel better once I start catching up with my school work, I have everything to do so, I just hope I can find the will power to get it done. I do love what I study, and I'm happy to say that I actually look forward to becoming a teacher in the future, but it's a bit overwhelming to think that I might spend these next 3-4 years only to realize my mental health will be in the way of me becoming the teacher I want to be.",12Nov2020,1
297,"4 days ago out of morbid curiosity, I watched a very graphic and 100% real video online in which a man has his head severed by terrorists, and naively, I had no idea it would affect me that way. I didn't think I would ""enjoy"" it of course, but I thought it would merely make me nauseous &amp; sad, and that I would be able to go on with my life afterwards. Except I feel as if it has given me full blown anxiety &amp; depression. I did expect to have empathy for that poor guy but I didn't think it would literally make me anxious and depressed afterwards, especially since our generation is mostly desensitized to blood/gore through movies, tv shows, etc... I guess it didn't occur to me that it being real would make such a big difference for my mental health. 

Obviously we're in the middle of a lockdown so I'm not saying I was hugely happy before that but I was doing okay, keeping myself busy and entertained. But now this video has literally clouded my view of everything else and I can't enjoy things quite as much. I definitely can't watch a horror movie or thriller whereas that wasn't never something I was squeamish about originally.

what makes it worse is that she also has suffered from mental health problems in the past and i always tried my best to be respectful and never say anything that would make it worse but she can’t even do the same for me. 

anyway shes away for uni which kind of helps but she comes home every once in a while. am i wrong for wanting to be around her less? we get along sometimes, we’ll watch tv shows and go places but as soon as she says some shit i get so taken aback and i just cant be around her.",12Nov2020,1

I feel so frustrated and sad mostly because of myself. Its been like this for like a year now.I am literally unable to move on from my elementary- middle school bullies, and I’m pretty much not good at anything. I absolutely hate the way I look  and the way I feel around people : idk if I have anxiety but I get sweaty and my voice shakes and I feel so anxious when I have to talk to new people irl, or in class even .I think about what my bullies did to me/ said to me  almost everyday and I compare myself to them a lot and it’s been over 4 years since it happened and I think that’s mostly what shaped who I am now .I am so anxious whenever I’m talking to people.I always feel like almost everyone hates me and it’s so tiring lol. I hate myself very much and it’s very hard for me to open up or be my true self around people But the thing is, idk who I truly am and I feel like I change myself for other people, I’m also too agreeable and I used to be quite naive but I’ve learned my lesson.i used to cry so much until 12 years old or so and now I can hardly talk about how I truly feel and I resort to cutting because I feel like it’s worth it and it’s a way or coping and/ or a way of punishing myself for my actions as a child mostly. I am ashamed of the things I’ve done as a child and I blame it all on my mom. I don’t have a dad and my mom never really cared about me and we’ve never had a real mother-daughter bond or whatever . I used to have that kind of bond (kinda) with my aunt until my cousin came into our lives lol. I don’t wanna make this too long so yeah.



I also feel so guilty for every small interpersonal thing. And I feel so selfish for writing this and potentially wasting a few people’s time, im sorry if I did .I feel like no one will ever truly care about me enough and I feel very selfish for it. But there’s almost always this voice in my head that says stuff like “you’re over dramatic, you’re a pussy, you’re bad with words you shouldn’t have written this, they hate you, that teacher thinks you’re rlly dumb, your family hates you, etc”.


I have some amazing close  friends and I’m so grateful for them. I try my best to be a good person and a good listener towards my friends, I’d never let them down. But i get some ugly thoughts before making any decision but I never act on them. Idk if that’s normal but yeah. I have this undying feeling that I’m two faced or something , I don’t wanna get too much into that.


I also feel like there’s a child part of me that feels real, but the real part of me or the other part of me doesn’t feel real. I honestly feel like I’m dreaming, when I’m writing this too. I’ve been in this kinda bad dream since I was almost 15 or so, I’ll be 16 soon now. I am grateful for many many  things but I guess I let my fears and anxiety get the best of me all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

I was bullied at school, mainly cos my teeth were stuck out n a lot of em were twisted, i started hating myself because of it and stopped takin care of my teeth, they got so bad that when i was 22 i had them all taken out....which makes me feel even worse about myself now and i have no confidence becaus of it and other things. when i was 14/15 school sent me to college  cos i refused to go to school (i struggled with school a lot mainly due to dyspraxia) which meant my writing was really bad and most peop,le who know me believe i have ADD cos i couldnt and still cant concentrate on anythinf for long, the only thing that i can is if im playing on a game my N7shepard name is from mass effect, my favorite game. anyways i dropped out of college too cos of these issues. 

&amp;#x200B;

when i started work i had mainly dead end jobs that i couldnt hold down cos as soon as someone would look at me id think they were thinkin stuff about me and that i was useless at the job, my self esteem is obviously sky high and i think im amazing.....sarcasm doesnt always show thru txt lol

I ended up having to stop work cos of depression and anxiety and didnt work for nearly 7 years, in which time i met someone and had two kids with. but the 1st couple of years of outr relationship she would leave me everytime she met a guy she liked, which was pretty often cos she might as well of lived in here local pub, i stayed away cos i cant be around drunk people very easily (dunno if subconsciously i remember what my dad was like) and i dont drink cos i generally try to hurt myself when drunk, my 18th bday party i had too much to drink, tried slitting my wrists with the knife they gave me to cut the cake then ran away into a main road to try get run over.....so yeah i wont be doin vodka again anytime soon.

when i was about 24 we split up for good, she left me for someone she met onFB and started playin happy familys with him and our kids and i went over the edge and had to be put in a mental home for mine and her new guys sake, i have a really bad temper and feel like im on fire when i get angry and honestly scare myself and i dont scare easy.....unless theres a spider and i do a great impression of a 6 year old girl :/ i had to see my kids with a social worker for a while cos they thought i might hurt them (i never would and even the kids mum told em that) i fail at everything but i try my best to be a good dad and give my kids things that i never had as a kid.but sometimes my anger does get the better of me and i shout at them for little stuff then hate myself afterwards, my daughter for the last part of last year wouldnt stay the weekend (i have them every weekend) but foir ages she wouldnt see me and only recently shes come round and im trying to be better for both of them, im strict with them too but only cos i live in a shit area in england with lots of crime and i dont want them growing up like the dickheads i see round my estate starting fights and arguments with everyone cos theres 8 of them to 1 of you.

&amp;#x200B;

after i finally got myself sorted and out of the home i got stable and managed to get a job and actually enjoyed it and  was there for 9 months (yeah not long but for me it was massive)  but then i had a accident at work while carrying heavy stuff, fell and sort ob bent of like i was doing a limbo but with 75 of weight on my chest, ripped my tailbone from its place and exposed nerves behind it so not i have serious back issues and nerve damage down both legs and have since been diagnosed with hyper-joint mobility syndrome so my joints are gettin looser and some days it feels like my hips are gonna fall off, also when i do do any form of exercise or even just walkin to the shop it affects my joints 3x more and takes 3x longer to recover so when i have my kids at wekends i  try do lots with them then when they go home sunday im laid up in bed till weds/thurs some weeks, only reason i can manage to do stuff is cos i get codiene and nerve damage pills from the docs and i get codiene from a family member cos she dont use it much, and morphiene tablets when i can manage to get one without my mum noticing, im basically high all weekend then the come down and damage to my body feels like i was the ball in a game of rugby/american football. im fucking my body up taking too much stuff but if i didnt id feel like even more of a failure if i couldnt do stuff with my kids, their are literally the only reason i carry on.

but recently im feelin worse and worse, mentally and physically, wonderin if im doi n a good enough job then thinkin im not and i dont wanna be here then i feel doubly worse thinking how could i think about leaving the kids. another recent thing is a tv show said something about borderline personality disorder and i looked into it and all the symptoms describe me almost perfectly, im thinking about getting therapy again and seeing if i can .....i guess think totally different and be a whole new person.....GL with that :)

I've just dropped all my classes this semester because it would have been nearly impossible for me to pass them and if I fail them this time I'm kicked out of the program. This is my 5th year in school, people are already asking why it's taking me 5 years, and my parents are annoyed because I took a year off before starting school and all my friends have graduated and have jobs. I'm currently at home because of covid and haven't told my parents that I dropped my classes and they think this is my final year. So, now for most of my time home, I sit in my room pretending to do work. I don't know why I'm like this, but whenever it comes to schoolwork I dread everything and in lectures, I fall asleep and struggle to pay attention. Starting to study or do an assignment is a mountain on its own since my anxiety kicks into over-drive and I can't get out of the loop telling myself I'm worthless and not good enough. What makes my parents super annoyed is that in high school I was a straight-A student, and I have no answer that satisfies them.

I lied when I said I don't know why I'm like this, I can pinpoint where it started but I don't know how to begin fixing it. In the past couple of years four of my friends have died, three of them took their own lives. I started talking to a counselor at my university this semester who told me that I'm not over their deaths and that I need to work through my process of grieving, but I don't know how to do that. I also tried to get a doctor's appointment to try and start taking anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication, but I can't get a doctor's appointment due to the amount of COVID cases in my city.

Everyone says something like to dance or exercise but I barely have the energy to get up. 

I've been getting better but I'm still frequently struggling. I notice I feel a bit better after having some dark chocolate and supposedly it helps with endorphins so I grab it fairly often. I feel like if I can get on top of my to-do list then I'll be freed of a lot of stress but I can't find how to get the energy to get started. I want to, I just can't seem to get it going.

324,"I'm just going to word vomit here because I can't really think straight.  I obsess over every little thing I do, like whether or not I said or did something wrong.  My self esteem is incredibly low.  I constantly just worry about the littlest things to the point where they're irrational.  I'm stuck in this self fulfilling prophecy type situation where every time something makes me happy I have this ""what if you have a panic attack"" kind of anxiety and then I have a panic attack and it ruins it.  The fear of having a panic attack causes me to spiral.  Every word or thing I do has some reason why it's wrong, or some unlikely paranoid scenario that will come of it.  I'm self aware as shit and I really don't have much of a support group.  People look at me like I'm stupid sometimes or like I'm joking with them, but the things I worry about are very real to me even if they don't make sense.  It's getting to the point where I don't want to be around people cause I know I'll be anxious about something by the end of it.  I just wanna isolate, but I already feel so alone.  I'm afraid to get help because last time I did, I got locked up in a treatment facility.  I don't wanna misspeak.  I honestly think it's just the feeling invisible that's killing me.  The isolation is a vicious cycle.  I have no one to be around or talk to, no real reason to feel good about myself at all, and no point of reference besides my own head and maybe coworkers or people I regularly see, that to be honest aren't exactly understanding or supportive.  (Nothing against anyone, they just don't seem to understand how I feel.)  Idk I'm just rambling.  I just want out of my own head.  I'm overthinking things to the point where even just little forms of innocent escape turn into spirals of fear or paranoia.  If anyone even kind of understands, that would be refreshing.  I feel like even actions that won't have actual consequences will somehow feed into me having another panic attack, and I think that's a big part of it.  I don't want to associate every single thing in my life with guilt or embarrassment or anxiety, but it's hard when this cycle seems to turn everything into a trigger for me.

I've been dealing with my friend and his mental health issues for 4 years already. He's tried to attempt suicide a few times before and has recently been using increasingly lethal methods to cope such as drinking wayyy too much, cutting, eating pills.

I love him, but frankly, I'm running out of patience myself. We're planning to get a room together soon for college, but I don't think I can deal with him like that for another 3+ years if he stays like that especially since we'll be living together. I'm not going to cut him off either because he's a precious friend of mine and has supported me with my issues too.

I know people who are depressed can't help feeling like that, but it makes me feel frustrated when I have to listen to him say deprecating things about himself or talk about how much he wants to die, because no matter what I say in these past 4 years he won't feel better or treat himself better. But I still have to be there for him since he's my friend. 

What can I do to help him? Should I force him to go see a therapist? He's very hesitant to reach out for help, doesn't really trust counsellors/therapists, doesn't trust medication because he tried ONE type and decided that it wouldn't work and only made him more depressed. I think to access a therapist/psychologist we have to go out of town somewhere further away so I don't think he'd be able to attend very frequent sessions. 

Also, is there anything I should be aware of or things I can do for him when we're living together as well? Would it be a good idea to confiscate his things if there's too much alcohol or if I find pills?",12Nov2020,1

i'm 22 and my BMI is 44. i have severe mental and behavioural issues, i take antipsychotic medication, and as a result of taking this life saving medication, i binge eat a lot. my average meal at mcdonalds consists of 15 mcnuggets, and mega chesseburgers. i only eat mcdonalds and pizza, roughly 2 times a day. it has caused financial strain. i have no will or desire and energy to exercise, and i noticed that compare to when i was not on medication, it was much slower to lose weight. i have autism and it's hard to cut out my routines, extremely hard, my autism is low functioning. lots of people urge to stop medication but if i do that my life will be over before heart disease.

last month i exercised so hard for a week that i had a blister and cyst that became wildy infectious and i needed to go to the hospital. i barely lost 2 pounds, compare to the 9 pounds i lost in a week when i was on no meds

next week i am willing to try some exercise with the amphetamine my doctor will prescribe.",12Nov2020,1

331,"I’ve been going through a lot (my previous posts give a good start but aren’t updated to recent events), and I’ve been experiencing more panic/anxiety symptoms recently in addition to the good ol’ fashioned depression. Given recent things events and the end of the semester drawing near, I’ve been swamped with things to do which have an important impact on whether I continue university next semester, how I will continue if I do, and just figuring out... well, feels like everything. 

I’ve been trying to count my little victories and not think about everything I have to do. Unfortunately, it seems like it’s either that I think about everything I’ve been going through/try to process, which leads to constant pain and panic, or not think about that stuff/not approach the big planning things, which doesn’t lead to pain but still leads to a generalized feeling of unease at all times with bouts of panic.

In addition, recently I’ve been able to identify (I specify “identify” because I’ve had the problem I’m going to describe in a moment for pretty much since I can remember, but it didn’t really hit me what might be causing such an extreme reaction until this year) that when I feel interrogated or like I’m getting a “rapid-fire” or questions or comments relating to the initial question, my mind initially goes blank for a moment, and then I gather my thoughts (I always try to gather my thoughts before I speak, but this usually takes much longer than usual). But then I find that I’m unable to speak at all. Sometimes I’ll be able to open my mouth to try to speak, but no words or even sounds can come out. I’ve always had aversion to speaking to people, especially on the phone, as opposed to text, but this is more extreme. I can be shouting the words in my head, but for some reason my mouth and vocal chords just won’t cooperate. The more that gets said by other people since the initial question the worse that I seem to be unable to speak and more prone to just crying even if my thoughts are rather clear. This inability to speak only really seems to happen in very emotional conversations or even in normal ones but if I am asked question after question or many comments are made after an initial question. I just wanted to know if anyone else experiences this and how I can navigate it. This inability to speak is really making communication with my parents hard about my mental health issues because they’ll ask me a ton of questions right after the other, but then I’ll get overwhelmed and won’t be able to respond fast enough by the time they’ve told me not to worry about it and moved on to a different topic. (Apparently, they think I’m “non-cooperative” or that I “refuse to/reluctantly communicate” with them, and what I can communicate with them are “surprising emotional outbursts” that they weren’t expecting.)

Anyway, if anyone has tips for dealing with panic when you’re trying to process/address the important stuff or has dealt with the speaking inability issue, I’d really appreciate some advice or commiseration. Thanks.",12Nov2020,1

For example if my little brother cries (her doing) she starts laughing. She hides my laptop, phone, keys and will not tell me she hid those and then like 3 hours later she would tell me where it is and think it’s funny. Today is the last straw because she hid my keys and lied about it so I was late for an appointment. Every time I yell at her she does not listen or look remorseful. She has tantrums almost everyday for small reasons (the screaming and kicking kind, sometimes bites herself). I’m just starting to get super exhausted having to deal with her and babysit her everyday. It’s starting to make me rage inside and have all this negativity. I do nothing but good things for her because she is my sister and I love her. But sometimes when I have to discipline her, she gets tantrums and does not listen. I don’t know if this is how most little kids act but my mother told me she’s never met such a “devil child”. I don’t know if I should go to a child psychologist with her or if she’s too young, or maybe she will grow out of it, or if there’s something I could do to help her.

I was in a healthy relationship, he was there to supported me, helped me, motivated me to become the better version of myself but I always feel bad that sometimes I just can’t. I never told him that I’m depressed or smtg but I think he knew. 
My mind is full of negativity and when I’m alone I cry about myself.
I hate my job but looks like I can’t get out of it sooner. Everyday I pretend I enjoy it and its slowly killing me. The night before I go to work, I cry sometimes and say to myself “I don’t want to go. I hate it there.” I even imagine and hope I get hit by a car so I don’t have to go.

For far too long now, I've been very emotionally void, I've been lacking in communication, including during conversations that are and I have been failing to present my passion for her. I'm not the most creative or imaginative guy, especially when it comes to dates or just evenings together, and to top it off, more often than not, I find myself flying off the handle over even the silliest things. My overall emptiness has caused so many arguments as she does not believe that the love I claim for her even exists anymore.

For the first year or so of our relationship, I was the polar opposite of all of this. I could not stop expressing myself to her, nor did I ever want to stop. And I still have my good days, as one does. I can't at all determine what brought this change out in me, but it's not a welcome one by any means. I dont know what to do, nor how to ""fix"" this imbalance in me. This isn't a love that I want to lose, but I know she's running out of straws.

i want to actually do well in school, have hobbies, keep stable relationships with my friends.

i hate making excuses to all my teachers about why i haven’t done any work in weeks because i can’t let them tell my parents :/
i’ve texted crisis lines, but they’re not therapists. they won’t help me in the long term. 

so i ask, how the hell do i take this into my own hands? are there any online therapists or something of the sort that don’t require parental consent?? do i just try to hold out until i’m 18???

344,"I’m going to do a quick recap 

-very depressed from 2011-2014 
     -not suicidal but walking zombie, no self confidence, no interest in anything, etc., etc.
     -family &amp; friends noticed I was off but did nothing (no therapy, no doctors, no medications)
-developed a strong relationship in 2014 &amp; felt happy for the first time in what felt like forever
-had a falling out w family &amp; distanced myself from most friends (largely bc of relationship)
-relationship ended up being toxic/abusive yay me!
-ended the relationship in 2015
-super depressed in 2016 &amp; 2017 (drank a lot of alcohol when alone, true to self harm to no luck, tried to develop an ED w no luck, racked up thousands of debt from bars and retail therapy) 

After ^the above^ I seemed to get my life somewhat together. In 2018 I definitely was having a lot of anxiety and probably some degree of depression. Started seeing my first therapist but honestly didn’t really gain much from therapy (didn’t really put much in though either). Ever since I’ve been living a seemingly healthy life. 

But I have no plans or goals for the future. I still wouldn’t care if I died in a freak accident or something. I’m super content with dying but not suicidal. I literally don’t remember what being happy feels like. I’m an occasional drug user (like every other week). Had some scary drug experiences &amp; never try to OD but again wouldn’t care if I accidentally did. I don’t seem sad. But like I’m not happy. So idfk. 

I’ve also started seeing a new therapist so am somewhat hopeful but I just have no motivation to even try and be honest and work through my traumas. 

Is this normal or what do I need to do?

345,"Hi, I'm a person who has been previously diagnosed with major depression with psychosis. My psychosis has gotten better over the last couple of months as my depression started to lift a little bit. However, I'm not sure what this is but I have been experiencing a problem. I sometimes can't control the things that I say or do sometimes. It's very weird and I would say quite embarrassing because I know I don't have Tourette's disorder because this stuff doesn't happen at random. It happens when I experience anxiety, usually when I'm by myself in my thoughts I think of something that previously caused me anxiety and I act out. I just uncontrollably blurt out random nonsense and I don't know what's causing it. When it's an action it usually manifests in the form of me hitting things or myself, scratching myself or whatever is near me, or biting myself. This is embarrassing because when I'm with my boyfriend or something I may accidentally scratch him  (thank god that I only lose control of myself for a second and my nails are never long) not because he did anything wrong at all and I would never purposely hurt anyone or anything it's just that when i'm alone I would usually reach over and scratch, bite, hit myself or the sheets but when i'm in bed with him it's just that his body is occupying the spaces I would normally scratch or hit). In a previous relationship because I was so anxious around my ex who was prone to jealousy and anger issues (not directed at me but other people) stuff like this would happen much more to me and my unfortunate ex who would have to deal with it because he was with me in my dorm a lot for many days at a time. As for how long this has been going on for, I'm afraid I cant really say for sure, maybe 3 or 4 years (I'm 19 by the way) maybe even longer but I can't quite remember much. I've been really rummaging through my brain to figure out why I do these things. I told my psychiatrist and he just asked me if I feel like something or someone is taking over me and I said ""no"". It doesn't feel like a psychotic thing where a voice takes over me or something. It feels more like a reflex. What has been helping me with these ""tics"" is this phrase my boyfriend taught me to say when I'm in distressed which is ""I'm safe and I'm happy"" and that usually calms it down a little bit but most of the time it's explosive and i don't see it coming.

I have been prescribed an SSRI (Zoloft) in the past but I do not want to take SSRI's or SNRI's due to their interaction with an individuals serotonin receptors. I have been a psychonaut (an individual who takes psychedelics to explore altered states of conscious) for quite some time in my life and plan to devote my life to psychedelic plant therapy for individuals. The reason behind not wanting to take SSRI's or SNRI's is due to the extremely complicated interactions they have with psychedelics in the brain as it could potentially make things even worse for the individual. My doctor for some reason won't even consider a benzo for me even though it seems like the last remaining medication I'd be willing to take.
