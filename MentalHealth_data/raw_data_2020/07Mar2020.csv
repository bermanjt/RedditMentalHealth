0,"Lately I feel like everything takes so much effort. And largely like that effort doesn’t pay off. With each breath, I can feel my muscles labor and gravity pull my ribs towards my lungs. I fall asleep everywhere and I appreciate the sleep because then I feel free from my physical body. I kind of wish I could just be a little ghost/ball of consciousness without a body. I love the people in my life and I appreciate them a lot. I am just having a hard time. 

I know I’ll never be enough. I try to convince myself otherwise, but I know I don’t really have intrinsic value to others. My value to them is what I can offer them. My value to myself is largely what I can offer other people as well. 

There’s no point to me rambling, other than to get these thoughts off my chest. I guess I just have to reach a point of acceptance. I will work on that going forward.",07Mar2020,1
1,"Hi all-

I should probably start this by saying that I don't think I have depression or a mental illness or anything like that, but I've never been sadder and lately I just haven't felt like myself and I wasn't sure where else to turn to for advice. 

So there's this girl in my close friend group who I have feelings for but she has made it pretty clear that she doesn't have an ounce of interest, although she still wants to be friends (idek if we're still friends though). Our relationship has become really awkward and strained and I feel like every move I make is the wrong one and makes it even worse.

Lately she's been feeling down and it makes me miserable to see her miserable, and I feel helpless knowing all my efforts to make her feel a bit better haven't done much. Everytime I think about this though I'm reminded of how little I'm worth to her compared to how much I care about her, and it's become this cycle of sad thoughts every night. 

At the same time, I've been dealing with some personal stuff and the little things I once appreciated just aren't as nice anymore. I don't even enjoy the stuff I once enjoyed. Like I recently hung out with my friends but as time went on I kinda just wanted to go home more and more. They're all great people though and they've given me good advice on how to move on, but it's proving harder than I originally thought. When I get home now, tbh I just sleep because at least in my dreams I don't have to face reality. I feel broken and don't have much motivation to do anything. 

At first, I thought it was slowly getting better but I came to the realization that it isn't after I started feeling sad sometimes at school, even though before I only really felt sad late at night. It's almost like it just accumulates over time. 

I'd really appreciate any input on what I'm feeling rn. Anything helps. Also, thanks to whoever took the time to read the entire thing",07Mar2020,1

15f here. i really need to vent. i feel like i'm making shit up. please tell me if this is valid. if i have trauma. if i deserve help. because my brain is lying to me. ill try to make this post as short and comprehensible as possible, but will probably fail to do so, which im very sorry for. 
im diagnosed with bipolar ii and anxiety, and am prescribed depakine 600mg and asertin 50mg daily + atarax 25mg on a take-as-needed basis. i cut, bite, punch and scratch myself as a coping mechanism, which has turned into an addiction at this point, as i've been doing it for over 3 years now. the same can be said about my suicidal thoughts, with me having a thought-out plan to overdose/hang myself at 11 years old. i vape every day, and as u can probably guess it is also one of my coping mechanisms. i don't go to parties extremely often, but when i do, i like to get shitfaced, hoping i drop dead (i also mix my meds with alcohol). pretty sure this has something to do with my father being an alcoholic. drugs are on my to-do list.
besides all of my addictions and stuff i shouldn't do at my age, there is more to uncover. i have a problem with men. i'm terrified of them, i can't walk out on the streets in the evening. at any given time of the day, really. all that i can think of is that i'll be kindnapped, assaulted, raped, killed by a man. laughed at, my every insecurity and flaw will be pointed out. i'll be called a whore, a slut, a dumb bitch. as i should, because i am all of those things. worthless, a piece of shit, someone who should burn alive and rot in hell. even though i am a lesbian, and am in an extremely loving relationship with my wonderful girlfriend, i strive for male validation and attention. i'll wear short skirts and shorts, knee high socks, revealing tops, put on a long hair wig, do a full face of makeup, stand in a way that will make my boobs look bigger, stomach smaller and butt larger. when i'm out in public, i'll closely observe all of the men that walk past me, just to see it they checked me out. thought that they wanted to fuck me. have control over me. told me i'm useless. 
i came to the realization that maybe i have some repressed childhood trauma. it has always been this way. my father mentioned sex in conversations when i was as young as 8. i started watching porn at 7, learned how to properly masturbate at 10, lost my virginity at 14. even now, i use masturbation as a coping mechanism. i do it until i can't walk, until my body hurts so much that i can't move. during sex i like to be degraded, bitten, punched, slapped and hurt, because i feel like i deserve it. i watch struggle porn and imagine myself to he the women in those situations. i'm very hypersexual, which could very well be my bipolar disorder peeking through. but it has really taken a toll on me. i should also mention the time i was groped at 12 by my male classmate. i said ""no"", i said ""i dont want to"", ""please stop"". but he didn't stop. called me bossy and told me i'm overreacting. laughed at me. i dated him after that. i have nightmares where i'm sexually assaulted/raped, helpless, small, insignificant. panic attacks before i go to sleep. i see things. i hear some weird shit. i feel like i don't exist and that nothing is real. i feel like everything that's going on in my head is made up, a complete lie by me. i'm faking it, doing it for attention, i'm an attention whore. i also starve myself and then overeat. i vape so that i don't think about being hungry. i check calories on everything. i throw up when i think i ate too much. i'm so fat and ugly. 
also, another fun anecdote! my father is a piece of shit. he is a former alcoholic and was very abusive. i don't talk to him anymore because i blocked him everywhere. our relationship is non-existent. i have horrible daddy issues. but he treated me the best. he also had a gun in out house, was threatening to kill my mother and my sisters. i've been to plenty of rehab facilities, i've seen police at my doorstep numerous times. he used to call my sisters whores, slutes, told them they are worthless. tried to commit suicide twice and my oldest sister saw it all. i should also mention that my oldest sister had sex at 12 years old with a man in his 20s, she's had it way worse. 
another story. me and my gf were about it to take it a but further one time. she clearly wanted to put her hands on my chest (under my shirt), but was hesitant. i did it for her and suddenly, my eyes were watering. i felt a pain in my chest. i wanted to escape and scream. i wanted to die. i felt so helpless. she asked me if everything was okay and all i said was ""bad memories"". 
anyway, if someone is still reading this- thank you, you made it to the end of my vent. i'm sorry that this so long.",07Mar2020,1
4,"There’s no way I don’t have depression or anxiety, but I’ve never gone and gotten tested or gotten help because I’ve always just kept it bottled in and dealt with it by myself and been in denial that everything actually is okay when in fact nothing is.

But I’ve found a good friend that I’ve been talking to and coming to terms with everything, and they make me want to become better. How do I go about getting tested for this stuff?

I’m 18, but I go to my family doctor that my whole family shares, so will my doctor tell my parents if my parents ask?

5,"Every little symptom that I have - A pain in my side, a pop in my neck, a cramp - I always think the worst. I Google my symptoms and try to self diagnose. I get extremely anxious, I obsess about the symptoms,  and can't stop thinking that it's something serious. I'm terrified of dying. These thoughts take over my mind and it's hard to escape them.

My family is my main support system and they are truly amazing. But I need more help than their kind words and love. I don't want to have thoughts and feelings like this for the rest of my life.

6,"That's the only way to say it. I just feel really unstable despite being medicated and having a nice therapist. I'm drinking and smoking a lot of weed after work. It's kinda like feeling life for the first time and needing to experience the extreme ends of physical sensations. I'm trying to wrap my head around the fact that I've been mentally ill for years before I had any idea.

7,"Sometimes I get this trippy feeling that makes me feel awfully sick and disorientated. I simply feel off whenever I think about time and how simply time has been going by fast recently and people are changing and I’m not truly recognizing it, as if my mind is numbing itself to be unable to react to change. I honestly feel like the past year or so has been a blackout. I don’t do any drugs but I feel like my depression numbs me so much that I can’t seem to remember of any memories from even a year ago...it simply feels like a blur and it scares the hell out of me. I sometimes feel like I’m still living in 2018. I feel like once I OD’d on xanax in 2018 May and went into the hospital for suicidal ideation, time hasn’t been the same. Around that time, I felt like nothing was the same anymore. I feel like I lost my identity and I feel like a ghost, as if I’m drifting through life without actually experiencing it anymore and I know I am but I can’t do anything to stop this feeling. 

What really tripped me out was when I realized that I don’t really recognize my sister anymore. Maybe it’s puberty that’s changing her looks but it feels like she’s grown up now, and my brother is acting more individualistic, and my step sister’s kids are already 5 and 7. I’m almost 19 but I still feel like I’m in the past. What truly fucked me over is the fact that the past year has been a blackout and time is getting faster and it’s making me internally panic and I can’t act out of hand or I’ll end up back in the hospital.

Does anyone get this feeling? It becomes to disorientating and I start to dissociate and just the thought of time freaks me out.",07Mar2020,1

9,"So I’ll try to make this sort as it’s basically a question/query that I was wondering.

Over the summer I attended a ‘bootcamp’ or sorts in an effort to get my weight where I wanted it to be. The camp was great, the people were cool, the training was fun and all in all I lost around 5 stone in less than 2 months and I had never felt better about my body in my life.

Weirdly towards the end of the camp when I was about to go home, excited to show off to my family and friends, I got really down. I was on the phone to my parents discussing noting in particular, probably travel plans, and I started crying. I ended the call and continued to cry for no reason that I could come up will, for a while.

When I can home and went back to uni the sadness continued. I’ve have mental health issues in the past that I only, in the past couple of years, came to terms with or understood.

I sought council and and happy to say that I’m feeling much better and encourage those going through tough times to do the same as it seems to help everyone I ask including myself.

So my question is, is it common to feel the most ‘down’ at your highest point? Has anyone experienced anything similar? Thanks 

TLDR: Do you ever feel especially ‘down’ when you should be feeling especially ‘happy’ or ‘proud’?",07Mar2020,1

11,"Hey, I’m an 18M and recently was diagnosed with depression, I made the mistake of allowing drs. to prescribe me meds after my first visit and had a horrible experience with them which led me to come off them within a week, then I had my first panic attack which I will call the lowest point in my life because it was the scariest thing that has happened to me and I’m still recovering days after. After I hit that low point I went back to my therapist and we talked which made me feel a lot better. I wanna turn this thing around, I wanna feel again and be able to enjoy life like I know I can. I’ve tried meditation which definitely helps along with controlled breathing but I’m looking for more ways to help better myself.

12,"Hi I'm new to this sub so sorry if I break some rules! 

Basically, I've been exhausted nearly everyday and also sometimes I get super sad. Like overwhelmingly sad to the point where I can't do anything except sit in my sadness. I feel the fatigue everyday but only feel the sadness two or three times a week.

 However, this has only really been occuring for about two months. I've had some things happen in my life which I think might be the cause of the sadness and I am a full time student who works and volunteers which probably contributes to being tired all the time.

13,"so just to start off i want to say I DO NOT HAVE DIAGNOSED OCD. i hate when people who aren’t diagnosed say that they do!! ok but anywho i have this thing i do that i think may possibly be ocd but before i make assumptions i wanted to maybe see if anyone possibly does that same thing or whatever

ok so basically some of the time when i touch something (anything with any part of my body) i have to touch it with the other side of me. like if i touched a wall with my right arm i’d have to touch it with my left. it would be (i’m not sure how to phrase it, but like mentally painful if that makes sense. kind of like an itch that needs to be scratched but for your brain.) it only happens maybe 15-25% of the time depending on the day. or when i’m consciously thinking about it. also super small detail but i normally check my phone to make sure my data’s off about 5-8 times per night like in a row, like i’m laying there and i check it then lay back down then 15 seconds later check again and so on. but it’s mostly the symmetry thing i talked about before. it’s this pattern thing in my brain, things need to be “left, right, right, left” or vice versa if that makes any sense.


there’s a little bit of ocd in my genes (my aunt) and i’ve had this quirk for as long as i can remember, also when i was like 6 i had a tic for like 2-3 months where i’d make clicking noises every time i talked but my parents just told me to stop and i eventually did.


anyways any help is appreciated (even if it’s just letting me know i’m over exaggerating lol) what should i do???",07Mar2020,1

15,"No matter what the topic is even if it's ""small talk"" I have to force myself to lie and it feels awful.  It's always been this way. Even if the truth just makes the situation worse or awkward or if it's inappropriate, I'd mostly say what's on my mind coz it takes so much out of me just to say something I don't want to. I also believe people when they ask me stuff during small talk. I believe them that they want to know the actual answer and not just doing the socially normal thing. I've been ""the werido"" in any group because of this. And even when I know that they don't actually care I can't bring myself to say the response they want to hear.
As a kid I would not understand why people would ask if they didn't want to know. And in a certain way I still don't.

I once threw a kid across the pavement at recess, and just laughed. is there something wrong with me? idk what to do, and I'm terrified of being an egotistical jerk, because I never want to be who the popular kids were/are. how do I move forward? what can I do to get over these things, when little things nowadays are ticking me off? I used to be able to calm myself down and release the anger some other way, but now I'm losing that control to dissipate the anger. sometimes I get an incredible urge to break something, to punch something, and I can't tell if its influences, me, or something else. I'm scared of my anger, and I don't want to let it out because I don't want to hurt someone or myself. I used to smoke weed and that helped a lot, however now spurts of tunnel vision that occur when I'm anxious, and it's annoying the fuck out of me. I really need help with all of this, and I'm begging that unlike most of my posts, a few people could reply to give me some options. I have ADHD and OCD (not the organizational version, the kind that makes my brain run like a v8) even a week ago, i was doing laundry and had a conversation with myself in my own head. it went something like this M1=me M2=another version of me. M2:you need more boxers. M1: yea, socks too. wait what the fuck, who are you? M2: i dont know... i sound like you though. M1:so youre me? M2:i think so. M1well do you mind? i wanna watch this show and u scared the shit out of me. M2: yeah, i got u.

so that's my post, I'm begging yall, i need help but i cant get it anywhere else, because my friends aren't real friends, my mom will just reassure me and trick me into thinking nothings wrong and im fed up with this.oh, i forgot, I don't know if i already said this, but i have alot of trouble expressing myself, but just a little bit better than my mom.

17,"Yesterday, I wanted to share some marshmallows with my neighbors. We have always had a pleasant relationship with them, and invite them over for our winter holiday party every year. We give them treats now and then, plus birthday gifts. They have a key to our house. They know about my illness.

They recently installed a Ring camera on their front door. I told them that I can't go to their front door anymore, because those things make me paranoid. I told them I would call if I ever needed to come over, and just go to the back door. At the time, they said they understood and that was fine. 

This was the first time I have had any reason to go there since then. I called both of his phone numbers. No answer. Left a message. Covered the plate in foil, and went to their back porch. I knocked on the door, then left the plate on a chair. Went to the other neighbor's house, gave him his plate of marshmallows, and came home. By this time, first neighbor's wife was off from work, so I called and told her that I had left the plate on their porch.

A few minutes later, I get a call from the guy saying that he had almost called the police on me, and I am lucky he doesn't have a gun. His phone was off because he was taking a nap, and the dog barking woke him up when I knocked on the door. (I didn't hear her bark in the minute I was standing there, but whatever.) He lectured me for ten minutes, basically telling me he wasn't angry (why should he be?), and he didn't call the police (why should he have?), and that I needed to not go to their back door, phone call or not, ever again.

I've been terrified to leave my house since then. The police kill people like me. They don't understand us. I have no idea how I would react to a bunch of cops running at me, and am pretty sure that any interaction between me and police ends with me dead. We live in proud ""Trump"" country, and most people have more guns than sense. 

Wish I could afford to move, but I've also had that little voice in the back of my mind, wondering if it wouldn't be so bad if they did shoot me. It has been a really dark goddamn week. I don't remember Wednesday at all. After ""super Tuesday,"" my head was pretty wrecked.

21,"This is almost 24/7, every day, without stopping, for 10 years. It's also accompanied by headaches that get worse with sitting up, and cognitive decline. Nodding or shaking my head makes the 'tinnitus' chime, and makes the headache spike as well. The longer I'm upright, the more likely the headache, which starts at the back of my head and behind my eyes. I have tried 5 different migraine pills and they do not do a thing for any of my symptoms.

Now for the most FRUSTRATING part

I wake up in the morning to ***complete and utter silence***. (I live in a rural area, in a house with very thick walls - my bedroom is just as quiet in the day as it is during the night). 10-30 minutes after I assume the upright position, the ringing starts to gradually come back. Come night time, I literally cannot stand to be in a quiet room because the auditory hallucination that is mimicking tinnitus is THAT loud!

I've also done experiments where I'll wake up every 2 hours, but I'll be lying in bed for 15 hours. At hour 6 the ringing is still there, but mild, at about 30-40% of what it was before bed, and after 15 hours it's gone completely.

I'm having rapid heart beat and palpitations the longer I'm upright as well.

29,"My medication was recently switched around and I don’t think I can handle the effects of it. 

I now have the shortest temper in the history of mankind. I am so irritable that whenever someone says something that I disagree with even slightly, I become so enraged that it’s hard for me to not compulsively attack something or someone. I can’t even hold a normal conversation anymore. If I try to hold my anger in it just gets worse and I start to cry. 

I strongly believe that my self image, combined with all of the terrible things that have been happening to me lately as well as my medication change is to blame. I am in a constant state of agitation that I can’t control. I’ve already mindlessly started attacking four people in the past week. 

I know that side effects like this are temporary, but does anyone have any suggestions as to what I should do in the meantime?",07Mar2020,1
30,"Hi everyone! Today, I finally reached a point where I had to share my story with someone to GET HELP. I've really gotten to a point where I needed to tell someone my story and I found reddit to be the most supportive outlet, and so, here I am. I don't really live in a supportive community, and I can't really share this with my uni friends either, and although my counsellor has been very helpful with the listening component, I haven't received any helpful advice that could get me out of this situation I'm in and improve my life. I apologize beforehand if my story is a bit long and may jump around a bit, it's my first time writing one of these and I had a lot to going on so hope you can understand!

Just to introduce myself a bit, I come from a very strict Asian cultural background with parents who immigrated to America during my childhood in hopes to allow me and my sister to grow-up for a ""better life"". My dad is definitely an alpha-male with the stubbornness of ""If it's not my way = It's the wrong way"" mind set. He is as Asian as one can get with growing up - ""my mother never let me in the kitchen"" = men don't cook in this family. Most importantly on top of this, he definitely has anger issues with quite the temper. I would describe a life with him as living with a time-bomb that I don't know when and how it will explode... Anyways, I will begin my story.

During most of my high school life, I've had a very difficult relationship with my dad (from my perspective). My parents have ALWAYS been arguing since our move to America around 10 yrs ago. However, things never really escalated until my dad permanently moved to America for 2-3 years during my high-school years. This was when he started to get physical with my mom during arguments. Their arguments would start from NOTHING (ex. ""the house isn't clean"") --&gt; ending with my dad YELLING resentment towards my mom for not being a good daughter-in-law to HIS family. THIS WAS MY HIGH-SCHOOL LIFE. Things began getting physical with my dad THROWING &amp; BREAKING plates, cups, and anything he could break when got REALLY upset. Then came to points where he would punch/hit my mom in the stomach, and my sister and I would run downstairs to stop it. Then there were moments when my dad began to just kick my mom, who was on the floor, and my younger sister (taller than me) ran down and jumped in front of my mom, and I would be trying to push my dad away. My high-school life was basically in constant fear and anxiety... But I didn't know better and didn't really understand anything about life and myself. I didn't know who to talk to. I didn't know how to tell anyone this. So i stayed silent with no help. And I didn't realize this was a trauma that would stick with me for so long.

When University came, my dad and mom still living together, things became SO MUCH WORSE for myself and my sister. Because we had grown-up and lived with the fear from the trauma and anxiety of ""what would happen to our mom if we weren't home?!"" mind-set, neither of us could leave the house knowing my mom and dad would be home alone.. Going to classes or libraries without Anxiety or Fear or Stress, were just NOT an option for us.. Then We soon realized this was becoming a huge PROBLEM for us because AT HOME, my sister or I HAD TO CONSTANTLY prepare meals (from scratch) for my dad, sit and eat with him, clean up (dishes), constantly do chores for him (such as ""make me coffee, choose a movie with me, set up TV for me""), and he would frequently just call us down to just talk shit out my mom. This was the case ALWAYS including Midterm Exam periods &amp; Final Exam period.. Meaning whoever had to stay at home could NOT get more than MAX 1hr to study without being interrupted. Even for a regular person, my sister, this was breaking her studying cycles. But as a person with ADHD, this was just breaking me down. I always took longer than an average person to get into focusing and studying, and so, this was impossible for me.

One might ask ""why do you have to do all that? You should just tell him to do it"", and I thought about it too. But I couldn't.. Because I know that not doing these things for him will upset him --&gt; his anger issues will kick in --&gt; then he would call down my mom --&gt; and the cycle of verbal and physical abuse will begin once more. We didn't want to risk this so we did everything for him. I constantly fear hearing my dad's voice. Whenever he speaks, I just immediately fear as I know how he is..

Even with all these responsibilities I had of being a ""perfect daughter"", my dad STILL expected AMAZING Grades from my University also. I am in Nursing and my sister is in Medical Sciences, so we both experience a lot of stress, anxiety, and panic-attacks while living with my father and mother and being a student. I entered a Uni program of Nursing. A career that I was forced into with constant ""I came to America BECAUSE OF YOU"" from my dad, and resulting in choosing a career path of HIS liking. Although I love helping people, I feel that my passion is something else... I have been wanting to tell him I wish to switch programs, but I fear for my mom's and my life as I don't know how he will take it...

There was a point where I confronted him with ""You always tell me your stories to understand your problems and listen to you as you complain. Can you try to understand that I am tired too? I have problems too but you always care about yourself and never try to listen to my problems.."" I thought I was being brave, but I was just being stupid because this led him to call me basically a traitor for talking back to him and blaming him for everything. And he cut ties with me for 5 months after (he was out of America for 5 months)...

My sister, who never really gets too upset, really got me when she came to me crying the other day saying ""Even my friends who don't have family issues like this are struggling to keep up with school... I don't know what to do..."" This made me realize that I'll never be truly able to focus on JUST BEING A STUDENT trying to figure out her life and focus on me and my career before anything ONCE...

As my struggle in this life is evidently becoming more problematic with combination of constant anxiety from even hearing my dad's voice, constant fear for my mom, fear of disappointing him, depression with my career and life path, and need to fulfill all of my dad's needs, I have gotten to a point where I wanted to disappear... I came to believe that this was not a problem I could just get out of... It was a problem that would disappear ONLY if either I disappeared or my parents did... But my parents would never disappear... I'm just in constant anxiety and fear with NO WAY OUT... I don't know what to do.. I love my parents who gave up everything for us... But I can't help but feel that I am not living a life and that I don't even wanna live it anymore.. I’m so sick of feeling so conflicted about my father when I know he doesn't even consider my feelings...

I feel like I am not living a life, and want to stop feeling anxious, depressed, suffocated and STOP feeling like I have to tip toe around a sleeping bear. Most importantly, I want to feel good about myself in University with improved grades and full effort into my career.... I just want to breathe a little better and feel like I'm actually living my life.",07Mar2020,1
31,"I’ve never had this happen before, though I had a transient psychotic-like episode a few months ago (and was never really the same since).

34,"I know it all depends on where you look and what you seek out but every community has people spouting their thought out but not factual opinions, for similar unoriginal minded people to latch on to the ideas themselves. 
I see it constantly in these mental illness subreddits and even find myself relating to things I normally wouldn’t think or put thought into that aren’t necessarily healthy to focus on. Normalizing negative feelings and actions does not make them okay. While yes, it is good to know that other people are going through the same things you are, but there’s a sick pattern of justification in it all if you’re not careful and it’s something you need to be aware in life. 
If you don’t like something you are doing but surround yourself with people/communities doing the same thing, it’s going to be easier make light of it and pretend it’s normal.

37,"Hi, first time poster here - kind of new to reddit. 

I’m 28f. I’ve been having a rough time lately with my anxiety and depression especially related to work.

Our floor changed around in august 2019 and all managers were promoted allowing for them to pick new team leaders. They happened to pick the popular kids at work who all hang out together. Since then work has been hell.
On Friday I raised an issue to my team leader which involved her and I cc’d in our operations manager (my old team leader, her friend and now also her reporting boss). My new team leader took it personally and took it out on me all day. But she did it by being overly nice to everyone around me, telling her friends what I did (which wasn’t personal at all, I was asking do I do this or do you what is procedure) and completely ignoring me all day. 
About an hour before I finished work I found out that my cat had been hurt and taken to the vet so I got a bit upset (I am a cryer, even if I’m angry. Which doesn’t help these situations). My team leader was told by someone else what happened, then someone else told her what happened and her response was “I can see she’s upset, I know and I don’t care”.

I’m in need of what to do next for two things.
1. It’s currently Saturday, we go back on Monday. I can’t stop having panic attacks over this and feeling extremely depressed that I have to go, that this is my life. Working 40 hours a week with people like this. I don’t know how to bring up my anxiety and depression because when someone has before they made jokes and said they were playing the victim. All management are friends and try and ignore stuff like this. Does anyone know how to stop feeling so horrible? Or stop feeling anxious about walking into this office.

2. How do I stop crying no matter the emotion. I’m upset but I’m also very angry and frustrated and I don’t know how to be a bitch back. I know that sounds silly but I’m a timid person who crys hahaha. Suggestions.

Sorry if this is not the right place to post this, as I said, first time poster. Please let me know.

41,"Hi everyone.

When I was born, my mom was 67 and my dad was 61. I was born to older parents and was very lucky to not have any health problems. I am continually grateful for that.

I've always considered my dad to be my best friend, as I have always been a daddy's girl and we naturally understand each other so well. Growing up, I was always much closer to him as he had retired a little early to take care of me &amp; pick me up from school. I am very close to my mom as well, but my dad and I have a special kind of bond where we share several inside jokes, sharing similar political/moral values, can hold a conversation for hours, etc.

I have always been scared of losing my parents, especially my dad.  I had come to realize at an early age that most of my friends' parents had been a lot younger than mine. Since I was around 6, I was always worried that I would lose my dad at an early age. I would obsess over these thoughts, even wishing that I would die first so I wouldn't have to face this reality. Eventually, however, I was able to keep these thoughts away by spending as much time with them as possible &amp; living my life to the fullest.

This month marks 1 year since he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Although the prognosis for prostate cancer is very good, and he is making great progress, my fears of losing have been slipping into my mind again. Almost every part of my day involves me wondering how much time I have left with him, and that the days are going by too quickly. I can't help but reminisce about how much younger he used to look before being diagnosed. I can see how tired he is from the frequent visits and chemo sessions. I can't even begin to imagine the toll it takes on him, but he continues to be strong for me. He always pushes the importance of education and my career, telling me that there is no rush to get into a relationship if I am not ready. He has seen me graduate university (although he wasn't able to physically attend because of mobility issues), but I can't help but worry if he will see me finish grad school, get married and have children.

I've tried expressing these fears to my mom but all she says is that it is life &amp; that she could die too. I am aware of this and I know that life is so unpredictable, that anyone's life could be cut short at any moment. I worry for her as well. She hasn't given me too much emotional support on this, and she just tells me not to cry in front of my dad because it will worry him. She is emotionally supportive with everything else, but not when it comes to this. She just saw me crying 10 minutes ago but she hasn't said anything. I am just so sad all the time, and I am finding it hard to hide it. I am holding in tears everyday single day, whether I am at work, on the bus, etc. I have suicidal ideation from time to time as well, but I am not not actually suicidal (nor do I have a plan). I don't know if I should seek help, but I just can't go any day without feeling sad and waiting for bedtime to come.

So it all went wrong when I was born. I was born with a few things wrong with me, I couldn't hear properly, so I had to get tubes in my ears, and by three I had to get all my teeth capped because they were too weak, this has effects early in life which I'll get to in a moment. By four I'd been molested by my half sister. In the early days of school, it was hard making friends, because since my teeth were capped and thus, silver, everyone was scared of me. This continued to around third grade when most of my visible baby teeth were gone, but then I had another problem, I was diagnosed with a chronic illness, Crohn's colitis, that was around the time I started crying myself to sleep. In fifth grade I told someone and realized that wasn't normal. Let me preface this by saying I was a really shy kid, and I still am, and very anxious, so, in sixth grade, I got massively over-whelmed by the sudden fluctuation of around ~100 in my elementary school grade, to upwards of 2,000, this stressed me out, like, a lot, which flared up my Crohn's, causing pain, which would cause me to miss school, which would cause me to get make up work, which would stress me out, and it was a whole cycle. You can see where I'm going with this. By mid-way through seventh grade, I'd has enough, I switched to an online school, but that brought along with it, another set of problems. With my illness, anxiety, and overall introverted nature, I never have been and probably never will be the type of person to go out and do stuff, and that meant that without me having to go to school everyday, I didn't talk to people much. The only people I ever saw was my family, and even that was limited, as I was nocturnal, doing my schoolwork during the night, and sleeping during the day. Around this time I realized I was trans, which was a problem, because my parents aren't exactly accepting of all that. But I digress. This, and the fact that I had next to no human contact took a huge toll on my mental health, and my mind started to wander towards suicide. I started self-harming, and constructs a suicide plan, and drafted a note. When the day finally came, I sat there, staring at all the pills I'd measured out to hopefully be a lethal dose. Of course, I couldn't do it. So, I cowered in my room, frightened at the revelation that I was one step away from hell, at this point, I was probably going anyway, but I distinctly remember (this may be out of order) counting down the days till my 13th birthday, because if I wanted to kill myself and still go to heaven, that was my deadline. Around the time I started really considering suicide and almost attempting it, I had a conversation with my sister, in which my and our sister were naked and she was making me lick her, of course, else told our mother, and that was how I learned I was molested. Anyway, my parents found out I was suicidal (I don't remember how), and called DHS, and some people came to our house, so no, no, don't do that, gave me a snack on the wrist, and left. A bit later my parents decided to enroll me back in public schools. It was tough at first, being back, but I'm glad they put me back in. That year was okay, and then ninth grade was where I, once again, fucked everything up. See, the beginning of the year was going okay, I reacquainted with one of my friends with elementary school, so I had exactly one (1) friend. Things were going okay,  classes weren't too difficult, I was getting by at the very least, until I mad as new friend, whose name was Gary. See, Gary wasn't a bad guy, literally everything that went wrong was because of me, but anyway, I was obviously, excited that I'd made a new friend for the first time in years, so I invested all of my time and thought into my new friends, which had my grade drop. Drastically. I nearly failed that year. The only good thing that came from that year, was that I had a great friend for one year before he moved away. And that I got a B in biology literally without trying. Anyway, at the end of the year I got really sick, don't know what it was, a virus maybe, but I had to go to the hospital, missed about a week of school, right before finals, and so that was fun. Nothing crazy just threw that in for the Heck of it. Anyway, fast forward to next year, 10th grade. Probably (so far) the best year of my life. I had great teachers, one of which had the same disease as me, and I have it my all, did pretty good, and missed relatively little school. That is, until December 5th, 2018, it was a Wednesday, it was overcast (not even a joke I actually remember most details of that day) and my dad picked me up from school, like usual. He mentioned that my sister wanted a fat guy's hamburger (a local burger place) and I said that I'd be cool with that, but what I really wanted, was Whataburger, so, we went home, dropped our stuff off, and we're off to Whataburger, it took forever because traffic was insane, I think it was about five that we got out of Whataburger, and about 5:20 when we got home. Anyway I say down in the living room to eat my burger, drink my sweet tea, and eat my fries, all of which I did, as my dad and I watched the news, around an hour later, I was feeling really bad, my stomach was hurting really bad and I didn't know what to do, so I lied down in my bed, and told my mom when she got home. I had a doctor's appointment that next Monday so I stayed home for the next few days, and when we went, the doctor just said, ""yeah this is pretty bad"" and told me to stay home till at least after new years, which I did, at least, I tried to do, until Christmas eve, when, after it hadn't gotten better I we stood to go to the hospital. I convinced them to let me spend Christmas at home, and went the day after, I was there for about two weeks, and after we got out, we decided to get a new doctor, because no offense, but actually full offense my doctor was stupid, because apparently I was *super* malnourished, my entire gut was enflamed, and I was going to have to get my colon removed. Until I met Dr. Pickens, who fixed everything, I did end up going to the hospital again, this time I had to get a picc line, and so, had to stay home for another few months, but after that, I was good, got my picc line out, went back to school, managed to get my grades back up, catch up on school work, and finished the year strong. Now you may think that's where the story ends, but no, I wouldn't be posting here if that was where the story ended.


Fast forward a couple months, summers coming to a close, my knees have been bothering me for a while. I hurt them on Easter, but figure out would go away, but they were just hurting more and more, so I told my parents, we went to the doctor, and would you look at that; my knees are deteriorating as we speak, as a side-effect of the steroids I had to be on to make the pain bearable to me. So I have to start off the year in a wheelchair, that's fine, that's okay, right? That's not gonna mess me up too much... Right? Wrong. I have to leave school halfway through the day, everyday, for the foreseeable future for treatment for my legs. Great. Of course, me missing school affected my grades big time, and the treatment made me extremely tired so I just topped going to school for a while, I couldn't get to school from a combination of the depression that was beginning to set in due to the fact that I was in a wheelchair everyday, and that I was missing school, which put me further and further behind everyone else. For the second year in a row mind you. I just feel like I half to work twice as hard to half as far as everyone else. Anyway, slowly I ended up retreating from everything, I would wake up, go to treatments, go home, wallow in my depression, sleep, so whatever I could to take my mind off of it, maybe eat, go to sleep for the night, repeat. That was my schedule for around three months, until my legs were good enough to get out of the chair, I could stand, but my walking abilities were limited. So I would use a cane most of the time. However, the treatments would continue. So: I would continue my routine, this time without the chair, for another couple of months. Until I was back to school full time. Walking fairly normally, though occasionally with a noticeable limp. I was now leagues behind everyone else. And now I was back to my old habits, self harm, getting high, contemplating suicide. There's me, a suicidally depressed teenager with a chronic illness, two bum knees, and horrible grades, and my sister, a perfectly healthy teenager with a million friends, straight A's, and at this point, as a junior, has already been promised a scholarship at a college. Like I said, working twice as hard, getting half as far. Though, that doesn't really apply here does it? As ashamed as j am to say it, I've all but quit. I'm trying my best to keep up, but it's so hard. I understand nothing. My choices are either buckle down and try my best and go to summer school and do credit recovery, or get held back, but then I'll be in the same grade as my sister, and I know me, that's only going to make everything worse. So the way I see it, I have two options. I can either buckle down and work harder, or quit, take the easy way out, and end it all. I've been through all of this in the first 17 years of my life. Everyone always says it gets better, but then why hasn't it gotten better? At this point, the biggest thing keeping me here is my friend. I've known him his entire life, he's a year younger than me, and his best friend just killed herself, not but a few days before his 16th birthday, he loved her so much. I can't do that to him, not so soon. So as much as I want to let go, I'm hanging on for him.

Anyway thanks for reading my biography, if you read it all you're my favorite human, I'm not even sure do got the point across that I wanted to, but I'm too lazy to check so just gonna hope for the best I guess. Have a good day.",07Mar2020,1

52,"(Semi rant) It turns out someone I thought was my friend isn't really my friend. I'm now just seen as their friends little sister. I was so happy this year cause I thought I gained confidence and almost all of it dropped faster than my sanity. Last year I had no friends, Was lonely, And at a very bad mental state. I found the hobby cosplaying which helped because I made what I thought were friends. Turns out they hate me. I have a few friends left but its only once every few months I see them.. I feel like I've been used. I could've bought a new outfit but I bought it from them, I offered them money, Let then borrow a cosplay, And offered them boba. I tried to impress them because I was scared of losing this friendship but, I'm tired of them ditching me. Cosplay, The thing that saved my life, Turned into so much pain on the end. I have no more motivation. I'm gonna try to make some more friends but as of now I want to sleep without rubbing my eyes raw.

53,"I was like 12 or 11 when a neighbour used to molest me sexually and used to threaten me.
I got beptized later when I became 13 and I told him to stop and my religion don't allow all these bad things.

He used to force me into doing shit. I am male and 22 now. No one knows about it. He is living normal life. Last year was so bad for me financially and mentally. My dad was not healthy, he was not getting any salary for 6 months. I was scared. He do not have gallbladder.

 I tried contacting some friends and asked them for work such as websites. No one helped me though. I found a friend lastly whom I found on Facebook who gave me small online work. I was studying in a uni and I thought that I should drop out. I was in severe depression and emotional as hell. I failed in 2 exams. I was good in academics throughout. Was in top 10. Everything messed up when I joined this new uni for higher studies. My roommate in hostel was pervert too used to fantasize about making playboy of our country. 

I can not sit in placements for companies this year. I am bipolar too and always think that I will make things work and do some stuff which end up failing, making me more depressed, everyday is a rollercoaster of emotions, one time I am manic and other time I am lying in my bed.

So my young brother who is now like 18. He is also shy. I looked at his phone, he searched for gay forums and apps and is part of some forums. I asked him about this. He did not tell me. This went for several months. I asked him several times that ""has anyone done something bad to him?"" He always denied. Today I told him about my past that a guy used to do bad shit to me. I was thinking that same guy was culprit. I was filled with resentment, fear and all that stuff. He told me that once a gardener tried to do bad shit to him, and my brother ran away as he was scared. My brother does not go outside anymore.

I can not tell it to my parents. They are old and are not much healthy. My career is ruined. I have no proof and I can not physically harm those perverts. This will raise many questions, and if went legal I can not win. I am really poor now atm. Now I am feeling so sad, I can not focus on study. I cry sometimes. I am coward I guess. I was always bullied, in school, in play ground, in everything. I was mocked because of religion. I live in area where we are minority. I am nerd wanted to break poverty of my family and make them proud. I wanted to freelance full time last year, but my procrastination, lack of expertise and depression ruined it. I try, give up, try again and procrastinate. If I get a job I will have to move away from my family making me more anxious. If this freelancing worked out it will be life saving. 

I am again in the beginning. I try to study, I get negative thoughts, I procrastinate. Yes I can not afford therapy. I will make it work somehow I think. I don't know how to feel safe in society. I am worried about my parents, my family all the time. 

I am reading ""feeling good new mood therapy book"". I have no friends, my career is ruined and I am depressed! This year I want to make myself stronger so that I can fight this bullshit. 

To the parents I beg you that always try to be in contact with your kids. Tell them when they are young that if someone touch them wrongly immediately tell you.

These perverts can ruin whole life of someone and can live normally in pride in society.

I feel like I’m probably going to ramble on but to say the least I’m only diagnosed with clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder but haven’t had a re-evaluation in years and can’t get one for a while for financial reasons. I’d just like help finding coping mechanisms other people have used who have felt the same way, I’ve tried everything but nothing seems to stop this spaced out feeling. I know there’s depersonalization/derealization but since I haven’t been diagnosed I don’t want to self label it. But this is how I’ve been feeling. I’ve always felt like I’m not me, hyper aware that I’m a real person but not really connecting my face and body to “me”, but lately it’s gotten a lot worse. I’ve had episodes where it’s worse some days than others. The other day I got so spaced out i barely even recognized my own name, I’m struggling to keep a grasp on myself and who I am. I really can’t remember a time where anything felt real, even when I was a child I never felt right or really in my body at all. I feel like I’m broken and I have no idea how to fix it. It’s scary. I don’t have a healthy support system in my life which doesn’t help either because I have no one to talk to. I’m in a relationship but my boyfriend has never fully understood what I’m feeling no matter how I describe it. I’m at a loss on what to do. I’m not on medication (and as previously stated I currently am not in a situation to afford it right now even though I desperately need it). I’ve tried everything from hobbies to attempting to make new friends and force myself to at least go outside  but nothing ever helps me feel grounded.

I've been having intense avoidant anxiety to seeking out the treatment I know I desperately need. Either I am reacting to the past experience of being admitted (along with a failed suicide attempt while ""under observation"" that the staff either failed to notice or didn't care to intervene) or large part of my subconscious has just already given up and my consciousness is slowly coming to realize this fight is no longer worth going through or I don't want to succeed.

Whatever it may be, I want to know how I can avoid being admitted to a place that, if it were a prison it would've long been shut down and the staff would've been indicted. I don't have health insurance currently which has been adding to my avoidance to seek treatment for the financial obligation that would follow. 

How do I accurately gauge the quality of a facility?

How do i explain what my needs are? What may help?

How do I know if I need to be admitted inpatient or can opt for a outpatient program?

Have you noticed that eating certain food makes you feel great while certain foodstuffs make you feel ill at ease. There is a good reason for that as research shows. Nutritious food is required for our body to function well, more so our brain.  Studies have shown that cutting down on processed food intake, refined carbohydrates, and sugar, and increasing fruits, vegetables, fish, and nuts resulted in improvement in depression symptoms. Vitamin supplements and probiotics also have a positive impact on improving the mood and overall mental health of people. Research has proved that people who followed the Mediterranean diet consisting of more fruits, vegetables, olive oil, lean meat, and nuts, have a lower risk of developing depressive symptoms later.  To know more on the effect of diet on mental health, please read the article in my blog:  [https://hubpages.com/health/The-Importance-of-Food-in-Mental-Health](https://hubpages.com/health/The-Importance-of-Food-in-Mental-Health)",07Mar2020,1

67,"This'll be long. I'm 18F. I dealt with anxiety and depression pretty heavily for 3-4 years. I feel I have overcome depression, and I'm a lot better at coping with anxiety than I used to be.

I struggle with my sexuality. I suppose I'm asexual, and knowing this and trying to escape it was a large part of my depression as a teenager. I am still afraid of winding up alone, and I am also afraid of human touch. I have never been in a relationship, largely because I can't handle the thought of sex or kissing. At the same time, I long to experience dating and love.

When I was younger I tried therapy a few times. One of my therapists was a very nice man, probably in his forties, who I wanted to like. On about our 3rd appt, he told me to sit all the way back on the couch (anxious mess I was, I always trembled on the very edge) and close my eyes and breathe. The fear was paralyzing. I have tried to analyze what I was even scared of. I was completely irrationally afraid he was going to rape me, but even more than that I was simply afraid of him getting any closer to me. Had he simply sat next to me, I would have broken down crying.

He isn't the only man I've been scared of. Teachers, relatives, even guys my own age. Women too. I am scared of physical exams. I haven't been to a doc in years because of it. It's so ridiculous, but I felt violated even by my female pediatrician's gentle touch. Even my best friends' hugs are accepted rigidly and reluctantly.

Why am I like this?! 

I feel left behind by life sometimes. My friends gush about their dates and crushes, but I can't do any more than smile for them. I can't even tell them about all these feelings, because it sounds absurd to be afraid of a doctor touching you or a therapist asking you to relax.

My confidence issues aren't severe, but they're very much pronounced. My good friends make comments about it (with positive intentions) and I just feel like I overthink things and easily fall into self deprication. 

There are nights where I go home to cry in bed feeling awful about myself because of little comments that are made about me (even though I know my reaction is irrational, or if a friend made a comment when we were both saying jokes about each other)  or I just spiral into negative thoughts about my appearence, abilities, and characteristics. 

I think part of it is that as a guy, I feel like the principles of toxic masculinity have affected me to the point where I don't want to be seen at a low point and expose my struggles. And I think my problems now stem predominantly being overweight and how it makes me feel inadequate but also I wouldn't be surprised if part of it had to do with the history of bullying I grew up with. 

If anyone has any suggestions on strategies or resources to use in order to start building a future where I'm happier with myself, please let me know. I'm so tired of being limited by my insecurities and I want to start living my life with less fear.

i have this weird fear of getting depressed. like i have no reason to be depressed, but what if it will start out of nowhere? it is so weird. and that thought makes me feel the way i feel now. i know it doesnt make sense but i dont even know.

im 18 btw, and lonely asf. maybe that's the reason

well im sure it caused me to be psychotic

im off college for a month now. fell out with my close friends and i am mostly at home. well i work out everyday, but i definitely lack human interactions. this past month was so bad. i didn't feel at peace not even once. i forget how it is to be around people, or how im percieved by them and probably that drives me nuts. because when im around people i feel normal, i dont feel there's anything wrong with me. well thanks god im past that period.

76,"I've been through extreme amounts of stress lately.  Brief summary of the past year:

Met the love of my life (at the time), had to leave due to visa issue (I am an American living abroad), left France at the end of my 90 days for a job in Poland.  Poland was shit.  After a  few moths I was miserably depressed and tried hanging myself in my apartment.  Someone convinced me to leave, went back to France to stay with this person (different person), and after two days she said she wanted her house back, this after saying I could stay for months. I scrambled to make money online, went to Romania.  Had a shitty month there, got a little more money together went to Belgrade.  Really liked Belgrade, decided to stay. Not realizing a lot of people just do border runs, I started the residency process.  Apartments were getting messy.  Noise, owners who wouldn't supply documents for the residency application, it turned into three apartments in a month, all the while trying to hold down a real job at this point (working remotely, but started with a financial firm based in NY).  So stress was already very high.  Then the apartment I took that was supposed to be my HOME after having everything approved with everyone, literally ... I got a Facebook message while running errands from the people I was renting from saying I had to leave.  No discussion, wouldn't say anything else,  just that I had to go.  I tried to find another place, more problems, and middle of the week, just had  a total nervous breakdown.  I was found myself walking the streets for hours not sure where to go.  it was a total mess.  I tried to talk to the people, and they wouldn't, which caused more suffering.  I get in to a new place, but at this point, I am broken,  I feel so utterly broken.  I maybe could have tried harder to talk to these people, it needed to be impressed upon the what state I was in.  I have a message drafted now i will send, but... I'm already in a new place.  I could go back, maybe it would help....  where I'm at now, though, work is not letting up, I cannot take time off (it's serious work, there are multi-million dollar deals riding on my work).   I can't just quit, I don't have much in savings and am living in foreign countries, I have no family, nowhere to ""go back to"" just ... the stress is killing me, I'm not sleeping well, having panic attacks, and mental breaks nearly daily I don't know what to do.",07Mar2020,1

78,"I am starting to realize i am becoming a bigger and badder monster. No amount of ''therapy'' will help or fix this animal i have become. I have missed so many appointments and sabotaged every little shred of betterment. As a result of the public system (Australia), i must attend a few pointless sessions to gain the trust to make sure i will attend CBT, Because it is not about the patient, it is about getting paid$$$.

Last week i was literally just sitting there and explaining my whole pathology and she just had a ''Aww baby'' look on her face. It exhausted me. i got home and went into a fit of rage, i beat myself over exposing myself and oversharing so easily.

i think it is pointless to literally blackmail me by telling me to attend a few sessions before referring me to an actual psychologist. 

I have no hope, the same abusive patterns continued in my life after returning home from therapy, particularly towards people online. It did not change anything, deep down i am still seething with rage and i believe nothing will ever help the unique human being i am. I am a serial Narcissist but one with the ability to have empathy. It took years of studying myself to recognize that i am a very rare specimen. I am a pathological liar, i am sadistic in every way, i feel envious all the time, i see everything as a competition in which i need to win, i am highly grandiose. I feed over hurting people and starting drama, i am a bully and i enjoy being a bully. A relationship is a means to an end in which i need to win, it is all about making the other person lose and crumble.

Sometimes i am able to reflect on my behavior and feel slight remorse, but most of the time i just don't care enough to feel any sorrow. I see society as a place that has destroyed me and as a result i am doing my due dilligence by abusing everybody emotionally in a very controlled, articulated, cunning way.

Many times i sigh at a therapist because i feel pissed off they don't appear as knowledgeable as i am when it comes to therapy. People on here keep saying ''get help'' and i have now, but i am just not committed, i am not interested in sitting and taking accountability for being some ''bad person''.

I can't even do DBT, because i would only use DBT as a means to manipulate all of the girls with BPD and low self esteem and use them as my narcissistic supply. I also wouldn't be able to handle listening to other ''losers'' personal stories, i hate most of mankind so how can attending a group setting help?

I feel there is truly nothing to fix, i recognize i need help in some areas but i just do not care enough to actually challenge it. It is all gonna take years of work, that is if no one triggers me in the process, but i am doomed. I guess i'll be another Sam Vaknin who will just be self aware but never do anything about it.

I am actually capable of improving some of these traits, but they come at the cost of other peoples needs. Some of these needs include: not triggering me, validating all of my suffering and trauma, validating that many times i am right and not wrong, having male role models, easing my defenses by treating me how i wish, and also giving me tips on better emotional regulation, anger resolution, conflict resolution skills, positive thinking. 

I forgot to add that reading many triggering things online is set to trigger a full blown episode in me, in which my homocidality is exacerbated, and trigger episodes of cutting myself, as well as tearing up on bed and having thought of overdosing on all of my meds. My mood is generally okay and i do feel empathy for people who may be hurting but this is selective and my brain decides who to turn empathy on for.

I am decided of being dismissed as ''traits'', i want full recognition of my personality disorders, if i do not get this i do not see myself as moving forward ever, and yes i care about a label more than getting better.",07Mar2020,1
79,"Diagnosed with PTSD &amp; anxiety. 
I used to also be major depressive,  but that diagnosis was removed. I've been both on meds AND doing CBT.
I've been seeking treatment off and on for almost 15 years; I've had a lot of side effect issues. 
In November, they put me on buspirone, which was helping. About a week ago,  I started having rapid heart rate,  spiking bp, chest pain, shortness of breath,  etc. Turns out I've got serotonin toxicity.  By direction of my doctor,  I'm discontinuing meds and flushing this out of my system. I've got to wait to start new meds,  at least a week.  
I've been off my meds for a day.  I've been having marital issues,  and for the last months I've been clear headed enough to realise my frustrations with my marriage weren't mental health related, yet some of them were. Well, my husband upset me by not coming to bed until 630 this morning, a common occurrence.  I want to say something about it, but I'm destabilizing, so I don't want to overreact. Debating if I should just wait until I'm back on meds to address it, because I feel like he'll just say I'm not on meds, and that's my issue even when these same issues were brought to his attention when I've been stabilized. I hate that I second guess even legit concerns in my relationship and even tend to minimize my own frustrations because I'm afraid I'm always ""overreacting"".
I want to get this crap out of my system and move on to the next treatment option.",07Mar2020,1
80,"It seems like it's on and off, there are times when I feel like helping anyone I can, being nice to others in any way I can think of, helping homeless people, things like that. And then the next day I get the feelings of fuck the world, everyone in it. On those days I hate to say it but I enjoy watching others suffer. I wouldn't ever want to be the cause of it by any means but if I see someone going through it I almost find a sadistic joy in it. I want to help people one day and watch them suffer the next. I prefer the first but its almost like the extremely negative feelings are more intrusive than intentional. Hard to control. It's like I just want to watch the world around me burn and then I want to help the world around me in any way possible. I dont know. I dont know if I'm losing my mind or what.

81,"I think I just need some place to vent about how my brain consistently makes me believe that my SO values other, more immediate fun things more highly than me. Sorry that it's long.

In short: Long-distance since 2017, me (28f, depression, general anxiety, social anxiety) and him (31m, ADHD), see each other every 2 weeks, sometimes 3, he knows about my mental health issues, we're fairly well-attuned to each other, all in all very mature, loving and benevolent relationship.

Right now we're in a 3-week spell until he supposedly comes to see me next weekend.

It's been going pretty great for a few months now. Last week I felt safe and vulnerable enough to want to connect more and ask about more detailed future plans. We know we want kids and roundabout when, I wanted to ask him how exactly he feels about it as I know he's still scared of not knowing how to do things right/be a responsible enough adult. Also wanted to ask more about closing the distance, if he'd like his own place in the same city first, move in together in my existing flat or a new one, etc. Basically just create connection through specifying plans together. I asked him one Thursday if we could call (we only call about once every 1-2 weeks). He had to work a lot, and I didn't want him to push back his work just for some talk with me, as he has an important deadline at the end of March and his contract is on the line. Our call got pushed back more and more. Almost a week later I asked him if he'd be free the next night, and he replied that he was at a friend's house right now, drinking wine. I felt hurt because I'd had stepped back, but then not gotten first priority treatment when he was free. Instead, a hangout with a friend was more important to him. I didn't want to bring it up as this has happened a few times in the past, and I communicated how it made me feel like I wasn't important to him, and he always understood and said sorry, but yet it doesn't change. I attribute this to his ADHD by now, and a very secure attachment in that he trusts that I'm there and will be there, so it doesn't matter so much WHEN we talk.

Next thing is a wedding we were invited to together abroad. The couple changed their wedding date, I can't afford booking another flight. My SO didn't seem very fazed about me not being able to come. I know there will be a lot of people from his past there, and I told him how my brain was telling me that he'd just be happy to go there without me, because in my head I'm always keeping him from the more fun things (hanging out with friends instead of having a phone call with me).

And then, to top it off, yesterday my country's health government declared an area as at-risk for corona that my SO is going to travel to tomorrow for a yearly work getaway. They go to a hotel in the Alps, work around 6-8 hours a day, and spend the rest of the time drinking or skiing or going to the sauna together. We had planned that he'd come up next weekend, two days after returning from that at-risk area. Now if he goes, it's highly likely that he won't be able to come to see me. He has not decided against going. He says he's on the fence and hasn't decided if he'll go or not, but even that hurts me right now because it's in line with the other things mentioned. 

I'm having pretty bad anxiety with these three things stacking up and I'm just so tired of not being able to just brush these things aside.

&amp;#x200B;

85,"This is driving me crazy.

Aside from chronic depression, which I'd been diagnosed with 6 years ago, I went through a period 4 years ago where I had psychotic episodes for a little over 4 months, mostly manifesting in verbal hallucinations, among other symptoms. The symptoms cleared away after I was on antipsychotics for around 3 months, they went away right after I started taking the meds, but I stayed on them per my therapists recommendations.

Jump to the current time, I've been employed at my current organizations for a little over half a year now, and I've been juggling with showing up to office and maintaining my own business and work. Early on, my failing to balance between the two may have resulted in my boss having second doubts, and **I think** he started monitoring my workplace PC use sometime around 3 months into my employment. I have no evidence to support this, but for the fucking constant cues and behaviours of my co-workers, and this fucking voice I keep hearing around me when I'm there all the time. It's eerily consistent with whatever is going on on my screen, as if I'm having someone consistently commentate on everything that I do. I cannot work under any sort of monitoring whatsoever, and it's drives me insane that I'm unsure whether there's actually someone monitoring me or not.

I'm a long time amphetamine and flouxetine user, as I use both to manage my depression and make enough money so that I can pay my own bills and my immediate family's. We've never been that financially secure, so I've had to do this since before I enrolled in university. I never told my parents about my depression or the psychotic episodes, as I fail to see how that would accomplish anything but make those around me miserable.

I'm tired of whatever the fuck is going on here, and I even hear the voice as I'm typing this, although I'm on my weekend break, and I'm sitting in a coffee shop nowhere near my workplace. One of my co-workers knows that I come here everyday, and I've somehow managed to correlate this with the voice that I'm hearing right now. I think it's insane to even believe that someone's watching me, and it's driving me crazy. 

I'm not sure what to do, and I cannot confront anyone at my workplace as the last instance I've done this resulted in a huge fallout with someone who had no idea what I was talking about. I was paranoid back then, and I'm afraid that I am paranoid right now.

If it wasn't for the constant clues that there's actually something going on, I'd dismiss this as symptoms of stimulant abuse, and as the result of my constantly working mind, along with sleep deprivation. 

My therapist isn't helping, and I have no one to discuss this with. I'm afraid that if I confront any of my co-workers that I'll go insane at the very confirmation of the fact, as it has been affecting everything that I do for a while now. In short, I might fucking kill whoever I talk to, and I came close once before.

This may sound overly exaggerated, but it really isn't. I can't deal with stress in a reasonable manner, as you may have inferred, and I tend to build up enough until I lash out all at once.

I'm quitting either way tomorrow, as either situation is affecting me all the same, and its no longer healthy for me to stay there. I'm not sure, however, whether I should say anything, or how at all I should deal with the situation. I can't ask, as asking would do me no good if anyone denied it, and I'd still be skeptical. If they confirm it, then I'm afraid I'd lash out. I can't think of a possibly good outcome here.

I don't know what to do, and I thought I'd ask a bunch of strangers to help me out. I just want some advice as to how I should resolve or approach this matter. 

Many thanks in advance.",07Mar2020,1
86,"I'm autistic and also have emotionally unstable personality disorder, I've also been depressed ever since I can remember and of course due to my conditions I have anxiety. I've been through so much shit in my life its a miracle I'm still alive. My whole life I've been eating SHIT food that tastes delicious but is terrible for me. I have very little self control when it comes to food. Everyone knows food is connected to gut bacteria is connected to the brain and mental health. However recently I started the carnivore diet, that is literally only meat and animal products nothing else. I was inspired by Joe Rogan and a few others and its been great. I mean sure it's boring as hell but I've noticed a difference already. 

I feel more mentally clear, less anxious, I don't feel like my world is coming to an end every second of the day which is amazing considering the financial stress I'm under. I'm not angry anymore, I don't get paranoid that people are laughing at me or judging me I feel more confident. I'm not looking to food for comfort anymore. 

Only thing I would say is I need more salt, I can tell this because I used to train mma and when I didn't get enough salt I would feel a bit dizzy sometimes.

If you are struggling with mental health please look into the carnivore diet not only for mental health benefits but also physical benefits. I've lost 5lbs in 4 days, yes it's mostly water weight but the lack of carbs means I'm not bloated with water anymore.",07Mar2020,1

88,"Husband hasn't done this kind of thing often but I have noticed a few times he's really weird like this. Once when he still lived with his family we were on the phone late at night and he was hyperventilating, whimpering, stuttering, repeating the same words/sentences over and over again and then his mom knocked on the door. And he said in an absolutely normal voice, ""Yeah I'm okay mom. Good night."" And then after a minute he went back to freaking out. Recently he was going crazy again, wheezing and just...raving... I can't remember exactly because so much has been happening lately but he probably talked about killing himself or something and I said that I was going to call an ambulance and he just stopped and looked straight at me, and calmly said, ""I'll just act normal and tell them I'm fine. They'll never know."" And he continued on boasting about how he can convince doctors he's normal. I feel like he sounds like a psychopath at this point or something I am so very sorry if that's the wrong term...
Other things he does include banging his head on the wall, punching himself in the face, talking to himself, talking to voices in his head, more rarely but visual and sensory hallucinations as well as auditory like I said, wordless screams, seemingly trying to rip his hair out, sudden and rapid mood swings sometimes going back and forth e.g. intense anger followed by sadness and regret followed by intense anger again and again... Many times he has gotten a sharp object and would not let go of it and talks about how he should just kill himself so I don't have to deal with him or because the pain is too much... But he keeps reassuring me that he won't. The other day he wouldn't give me the knife but then he finally said that he would give it to me if I promised to listen to him... As though I don't listen if he doesn't have a knife? Yall that is just not true... I just don't know what to do at this point. I wonder a lot if he's faking everything.
He was diagnosed with bipolar a few years ago but I'm so unsure of that at this point. I'm no therapist but there has to be more.
He pretty obviously has mania and depression. He suddenly gets very indifferent and somber...or weirdly energetic, upbeat and confident...
The other day he took my phone and said he was going to go kill himself and headed toward the door... Honestly...? I stopped him. Physically. For about an hour I just ran after him and we wrestled for the phone as I also tried to stop him from leaving and killing himself... We both have bruises everywhere now. I know that part is for sure really bad but I have just no idea what to do at this point. I want to tell his family. I sort of fear for our lives at this point. Just wanting some objective opinions about how bad/urgent the situation is. My personal opinion is that he needs an intervention and to stay in a mental facility for a while... Btw he only started therapy again a month ago and after like 3 appointments the psychologist said to see a psychiatrist. We're waiting for that which will be in a few days... I don't think it's enough and worry about us making it that far.

She's extremely passive aggressive and unpredictable, so this was an issue before the mistake happened, but because this is happening after such a huge mistake my mind is running in circles. I'm terrified of getting fired, and she's giving me the cold shoulder (which to me seems like proof that I might get fired).

92,"In August, I quit my antidepressants. I had been taking them for 5+ years. After a followup with my doctor in 2018, he said I was okay to go off the medication. I knew I was supposed to wean off, so in 2019, I gradually decreased my dosage till I was completely off them. I felt alive. For 5 years, I was in a daze. I was not actively working on improving any aspect of my life. I realized that and I was now ready to take charge. 

In November, I got dumped by a person (X) I had been seeing for about 8 months. It broke my confidence and made me question everything I was doing. I was so hung up on X that I continued to let them in my life even when it was clear to me that I was a second option by then. I broke all contacts last week, but I worry that I will go back crawling if they ever decide to check in on me again.

In January, I quit my decently paying job in the hope of getting into a field I wanted to try out. I got exactly 1 job offer, in a month of passively hunting. And I have not heard back from them when I shared my salary expectations with them. 

In February, I decided to quit smoking. I had grown sick of the habit and though it wasn't easy, I did well and was proud of it. Until today, when I had an altercation with my flatmate. I broke down and smoked 3 cigarettes. 

I have a test to take in the first week of April, following which I will be able to study for a master's degree in my area of interest. I don't think I will be able to clear it. The competition is tough (15 seats, 75 applicants) and I don't have a portfolio strong enough to land me a seat. I have a month to build it up and I am doing absolutely nothing for it, even though I sit jobless at home every day.

I need to look for another apartment to rent by March end, but I am not looking, and it is tough to find a place in the area I live in. 

Before quitting my job, I was hopeful, ready to fight and fix the drawbacks in me. My mantra was to give myself all the time that I needed, focus all my energies into trying out something new. I was ready to invest in skill building courses, all the tools I need. Instead I spend once a week on an elaborate day out, out of my limited funds. I am afraid to commit fully to the new field and want to keep my high-paying older job role as a backup for when I inevitably fail.

Over the course of my 1 month of unemployment, I got more and more focused on doing nothing. I don't shower every day, just on the days I have to step out. My health is declining - I lost about 25% of my body weight over 6 months by just not eating properly. It could also be a side effect of going off the antidepressants. I don't have a sleep schedule. I don't finish basic daily chores like folding my laundry, or even making my bed.

I don't have a lot of friends around me. I know a lot of people but no one is close enough for me to dump my insecurities on them. I can only talk superficially to my acquaintances and make light of the situation I am in.

I feel like crying for help, but I'm too passive to do even that. I am overwhelmed by the position I have put myself in. I know failure is the first step to success, and I know I am supposed to keep on working on it. But I don't think I have it in me. I don't have the drive that I see in others. I am not a self-starter, and I've always wanted to fix that about myself. I don't think I can. I am beginning to consider I deliberately sabotage everything I have going for me.

97,"TW// Abuse, Overdose, Lack of hygiene  


Over the years things for me have gotten a /lot/ worse than they were previously, say &gt;2015. As a very very young child my mother left me with my father, who was barely an adult at the time as they had been a little dumb and decided that they'd do what they did at the age of 17-18. This affected me as a child somewhat but for a while, I did have a step-mother who I did love and care about. Around when I had turned 11-12, my step-mother started showing very abusive tendencies in which my father had also joined in on. Fyi, my father is a great person and I love him to death, but this woman at the time severely affected him.  


During my elementary school-middle school years, I had been a very talkative child and often got in trouble about it daily. I had to be graded via a score card that'd determine if I was good, okay or bad that day. I started growing a fear around it as my step-mom was clearly unpleased. I often got yelled at for this specific reason and vaguely remember how I felt back then. It wasn't good at all. I didn't have many signs of depression/anxiety as I was seemingly a very very social child and noone thought much of me being upset when I was home.  


I remember when I reached my freshman year, I felt like things were getting better and had a rather normal freshman experience. I was bullied around a bit and treated in a very mediocre fashion, but, I thought it was very very normal, it was common after all. Once I had became a sophomore, I could tell my step-mom and fathers relationship was falling apart. Near the end of freshman year and beginning of sophomore, I was losing motivation to even go to school. I couldn't pinpoint the reason at the time, and I still can't remember exactly why. I tried to fake being sick as much as possible or even harmed myself just to make sure I didn't go to school so constantly.  


Junior year was terrible. It was the largest turning point in my life besides when my mother left me. Around September I had decided I was done with everything. I felt so tired of everything and couldn't find a reason to continue. I had brought some prescription medicine a family member was taking, (I think painkillers, I can't remember) and had decided to bring it to school. I had a plan to take one or two each passing period before entering class, I took two in the morning before my first period. I continued to take it up until lunch time where I had taken it and sauntered off into the lunch room. I sat by my ""friend"" at the time, named Emily. Her friends didn't quite like me but I didn't care, it seemed like nobody did. I remember vaguely resting my head down and falling asleep, only to be awoken by noone sitting directly by me, assuming they went outside. After a while the principal and a member of security came by to check on me, asking if I had a headache. I didn't admit to it but they brought me along to the nurse nonetheless.  


They left quite soon after as the nurse, someone who I talked to very frequently and considered a mom figure, gave me an ice pack and let me relax in the office. I wanted to die still and I don't know what made me do this, but I told her what I was doing that day. I brought out the pill bottle and set it on her desk as she confiscated it. She asked me why I was doing it yet I don't even remember if I answered her or not. She called in the school counselor and called first response while the counselor talked to me. It was hard for me to talk to anyone at all, everything felt like a mess. A few men with equipment and obvious uniforms walked in, had me sit by a chair and started to take my blood pressure and ask me a few questions. They were going to take blood at the school but I begged them not to. I have a very very bad fear of needles and at the time I knew i was not putting up with it.  


After a while, my dad and my step-mother came into the nurses office. My dad was crying and my step-mom was staring off blankly. She didn't seem to care that much. They couldn't come talk to me quite yet but they were silently staring off at me. I felt a very bad sinking feeling in my stomach and felt a bit dizzy at the time, I was getting overwhelmed. After a little more assessment, the paramedics allowed me to go with my father to the hospital. I don't remember exactly what it was called. I can't remember much of what happened while waiting and it hurts a bit to think of my father crying. I of course had to get my stomach pumped, blood pressure checked every hour or so, blood drawn and ect. I was in that room almost all day and I felt insanely weak and tired.  


After that whole situation that happened that day, I had taken a week off of school by request of the principal themselves. The rest of that year was terrible as I couldn't be pulled out of it, I had to put up with it. I only started taking therapy in January once I convinced my dad I severely needed it. By this point, my step-mother at the time was not around anymore. She left because I was allegedly too much to handle. I had gotten abandonment issues, insane amounts of depression and anxiety all stacked into one on top of me and it was crushing me. I constantly begged my dad to put me into online schooling. I hated being in public school anymore and expressed it as much as possible. Finally later into my senior year, I made the transfer from ps to os. I was happy for the first few months.  


Skip forward to now, for the past few months I have had problems eating consistently. I am not able to eat as much as I used to and find myself forgetting that I didn't eat that day. My memory has been degrading for a long while also, I never was one to be able to remember my family member's birthday but it's just gotten worse. I'll lose track of time being in my room so often because I don't want to leave. I'll often forget conversations or important things people have told me. I feel like a terrible person because of it. My anxiety has gotten even worse as I'm not used to going outside anymore. I can't handle large crowds of people or anything of the sorts. This sounds a bit gross but, I rarely have been keeping my room clean, often hoarding dishes or trash in my room.

TLDR at bottom 

This is especially common on AITA but every where I look randoms are accusing each other of being narcissists or of having Borderline personality disorder, over a petty couple argument. It’s fucking wild. It’s like they refuse to believe that a neurotypical person could be shitty so the MUST have an undiagnosed mental issue and are obviously evil. 

And besides furthering stigma the ppl diagnosing others often can even name criteria for a diagnosis beyond what they’ve heard in some crime show, it makes me feel sick honestly. 

They don’t even know what they’re talking about but they feel so entitled and ‘educated’ that they talk down to and lecture anyone who points out that even if they where a psychiatrist or therapist you can’t diagnose someone off of a biased post on reddit that only shows one side of the situation.

99,"The more I understand my struggle with sensory processing disorder, the more the way my mother abused me for how it affected my behavior bothers me.

I remember my brother and his friend pinning me down to force a shirt on me they knew I couldn't stand. It was agony againsy skin. It was a button up, and they even put it on me backwards. My mother and everyone laughed while I screamed and thrashed. It was amusing to them that I was so sensitive. I remember several occasions when they antagonized me into losing control just to watch as my mother would beat the shit out of me for it, even knocking me out on occasion.

That's just a fraction of what they all did to me. It wasn't just my relatives, but also my mother's boyfriends. Lately, I've been having a lot more flashbacks of those times. It sucks.

My mental health was not that bad before but day by day it’s getting worse. I don’t really have anyone to talk to except one friend. Because of my disorder I successfully pushed away all the friends I had and now no one talks to me. I try to talk to them but get really anxious and it doesn’t work out. I have one friend who’s supported me through all this and she’s really great and she’s the only one I talk to but the thing is she has her own life, problems and friends. I cannot bother her with my problems the whole time. I don’t want to talk to my parents. I was depressed before but not this severe. My parents thought as I would start eating, I would get better and they still believe the same. But in reality, it’s completely opposite. My mental healths only worsened.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been experiencing fainting and dizziness, however it has only been in some specific situations.

These have been times like:

I went for a blood test and just after it was done, I felt extremely dizzy and almost passed out.

I had some vaccines and, again, only felt ill about 2 minutes afterwards.

Today I went for a contact lens trial, to get them tested for my eyes and whatnot, and around a minute after they had been put in, I experienced the same dizziness as the situations before. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I am wondering is, why do I only experience this after what has happened, and why only in these specific scenarios?

I was not really afraid of any of these ""procedures"", and I felt 'emotionally' fine after them, (as in I was not scared), and I feel like what happens to me is not really in my control, perhaps my body's reaction.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I know, I don't suffer from any other medical issues like diabetes, etc that would cause this dizziness, and I am always fine day to day, never fainting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this some sort of anxiety that only gets released afterwards? Or adrenaline? 

Any answers much appreciated, as I have been looking for some clearance for a while.

During the breaks, I wasn't always playing with my friends: I sometimes had these episodes during which I wanted to DISAPPEAR. So I would go to the darkest corner of the courtyard, and roll myself into a ball, then adjusted my red raincoat so it would cover my ENTIRE self, the hood over my head , reaching below my feet, and both my hands deep into the other opposite sleeve.

113,"Hi! Long time reader, first time posting. I am going to book an appointment with my doctor, but I figured it won't hurt seeing if anyone has experienced something similar.

I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for a looong time, but I don't have any sort of diagnosis for either (which is strange because my doctor keeps prescribing me antidepressants, but whatever). So, with these issues I do know that your sleep might be affected, but it has NEVER been this bad before. 

Basically, since around Christmas when I stayed up too late studying for my last exams of the year, I have not had any kind of normal sleep schedule. At first, it was just the regular ""won't sleep at night but sleeps during the day"" kind of flipped sleep schedule, but this past month I've been switching between not sleeping at all, or sleeping WAY too much. 

For example, Thursday - Goes to class, takes a nap after lunch but wakes up at 8PM. Stays up all night, falls asleep around 8AM on Friday, plans on only sleeping until noon but turns off alarm in my sleep and wakes up at 4PM. This time, I stay up until about 9PM, goes bed and falls asleep again at around 11PM. Sleeps through the night, wakes up at like 6AM on Saturday (today) and then drifts off to sleep at around 10AM and wakes up again at 5PM. To be honest, right nor it's about 7:30PM and I could probably sleep more if I went back to bed.

I've been sleeping more than I've been awake. It's kind of scary. Has anyone experienced a sudden shift in sleep like this? Like I said, I've been struggling with sleeping normally for like 3 months now, but no matter what I try I can't flip it back to normal. Luckily I only have class twice a week so I usually keep up pretty well, but I'm still worried my sleep will ruin my studies..",07Mar2020,1

117,"I have a sense of humor, I can joke, and I am silly- but my jokes are not usually at the expense of others. I have \*tried\* good-natured ribbing and joking insults, that I never mean- but it doesn't come naturally to me. And trust me, anyone at the butt of these knows I am always joking and seem to enjoy my attempts at joking or insulting them... But it still makes me feel awkward or guilty... I can't make jokes like that without apologizing afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do I even do it?

&amp;#x200B;

Because it's expected of me. Friends, co-workers, family- there are always people who like to tease me, and it doesn't rub me the wrong way most of the time- but if it does, I am expected to brush it off.

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, my boyfriend and I visited my family in another state recently. It was his first time meeting them. It didn't take long for my grandmother to laud herself for her intellect, about how women have more common sense than men, but she couldn't speak for me, that I had always been an oddball. I was proud of myself for rebutting with, ""I was wondering when that would come up."" Growing up, I would have kept quiet and just taken the insults. But she made the same comments a few more times through the rest of our visit with them. I would rebuff them each time, as though they didn't bother me, but each remark on how odd I was stung more and more. As a side note- one thing I was looking forward to was telling them about my awesome new full-time job in the arts. I wanted them to be proud of me. When there was finally a moment where they didn't monopolize the conversation, I brought out a postcard and brochures from my workplace so I could visually explain what I do... And I didn't even receive feigned interest. I was relieved when we left.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't express my hurt feelings without being told I am too sensitive. It has always been that way. My way of coping has always taking the insults as best as I could, focused on improving myself and trying to be a good person, and work on my self-esteem and sensitivity.

&amp;#x200B;

But why? It still hurts me, and if I just take the insults without expressing my pain, the behavior will go on, uncorrected, the insults will continue, and it will inhibit my ability to grow as a person. I told my boyfriend last night- on a good day, an insensitive remark can irk me-- but still be brushed off. On a bad day, it will be a tipping point that will put me through a downward spiral of self-hatred... Which led me to my epiphany:

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of people that don't want to watch their phrasing, because if they don't mean to hurt your feelings, then it is your problem- not theirs, if they do. That is as irresponsible as offering a beer to an alcoholic that is trying to be sober. You could say that a beer has low alcohol content- or that the alcoholic could refuse the drink, but it doesn't take much to go over the edge when your will is already weak.

&amp;#x200B;

Likewise with seemingly harmless words. I have suffered a lot worse than being called an oddball. Growing up, my stepfather emotionally abused me. He insulted me for my looks, for my interests, my intelligence- and even my worth. I was regularly called a bitch. I was regularly told that I would end up homeless. 

&amp;#x200B;

So when my grandmother made a thinly-veiled joke, a seemingly harmless remark, something as simple as calling me an ""oddball,"" the real translation is that she doesn't see me as someone with common sense. So much did she feel the need to point out this perceived flaw (and however else she thinks I am an oddball) that she did it several times more in conversation, which just further underlines her disapproval in me.

&amp;#x200B;

On a bad day, this could be what tips me over into a downward spiral. If I make a mistake at work- or if I have an argument with my boyfriend- being an ""oddball"" could mean that I lack common sense. Or maybe I'm too stupid to work where I do or be with the person I'm in a relationship with... Which means I don't deserve these things, and so I am essentially worthless.

&amp;#x200B;

I assure you, I have made great strides in knowing who I am, and loving myself, and working hard for my career in spite of the emotional roadblocks I had to pass to get there. I also know I have a lot more improvement though... But I would hope that anyone that loved me would want to see me improve and would do anything they could to at least not inhibit that growth.

&amp;#x200B;

If that means cutting out insensitive remarks or even watching one's phrasing, why wouldn't that be a consideration? It's so easy to so when someone's mental health is at stake.

&amp;#x200B;

So I think, for my own sake, next time I won't hide my hurt feelings when I am insulted. I don't think I will try rebuffing insults either- because that will only mask how I truly feel. The homework assignment I am giving myself, for the next time I am insulted, is to tell that person, plainly, how their remark hurt me.

&amp;#x200B;

And if they seem offended and say that I am overly sensitive, I will just know that they would rather make a stupid joke than care about my well-being- and who needs that nonsense in their life?",07Mar2020,1

120,"I'm turning to Reddit with this question because I feel like the psychologists I had have been of no use. English isn't my first language, sorry for any mistakes. I'm 23F.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've been in therapy for a few diagnoses for like 5/6 years now but I never made any progress. After getting therapy for a specific phobia, social anxiety with avoidant personality disorder (AvPD), the specific phobia again, and depression, I'm now on a waiting list at a specialist for AvPD.

&amp;#x200B;

I got an intake at a personality disorder specialist and they diagnosed me with AvPD. I'm now on the waiting list but it'll take a year before I can start therapy. This will be schema therapy in a group. Now, the issue is that I'm not sure I really have AvPD and it doesn't feel like it's my main issue. I am socially anxious but I don't feel like it's so bad that it could be diagnosed as AvPD.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I kind of began to realise I've been depressed and suicidal since I was a kid. My home situation wasn't the best and it never really got better. I decided to move out at 19 so I'm not in that situation constantly anymore. I also got my first ever boyfriend at 20 and he was my whole world. This guy meant everything to me and I could NOT lose him. The relationship was rocky. The problem was that I didn't mean anything to him so we broke up after 1,5 years. I fell in a deep dark hole and was suicidal for 1,5 years. Since the breakup I dated quite a few guys but I always attached very quick and I got so insecure about myself while dating them. They had a reason to not date me anymore or they just ghosted me. I basically realised there is something wrong with how I attach to people, especially when it's about a romantic relationship. I quickly attach to someone, I demand too much attention, I get enormously insecure about myself and about them liking me and that gets too much so they decide to stop talking to me. The last guy I was seeing called me out on this and I get it. Every time this situation happens I fall back into being depressed and being suicidal and it feels like I'm of no use to this world, that I'm not good enough. In the last therapy I had I realised that I get depressed and suicidal when a romantic relationship fails because I've always been 'lonely' in life, as in that everything I had to go through I had to it do on my own. And when I have a relationship, it means I'm finally not on my own anymore. So when that support suddenly falls away it makes me feel alone again.

&amp;#x200B;

It seems like the depression gets triggered by 'failing' in relationships and that makes me feel like I'm not good enough. I've made this clear with the psychologists I've seen and told them my main issue at this moment is me getting depressed because my relationship ended and I feel like I'm not good enough for anyone. However, I don't think they understand how much it affects me. I've been looking into what this could be. Although I don't want to self-diagnose, I do want to have an idea about what I could present to my GP so I can get a better diagnosis and a better referral. I've been thinking about dependent personality disorder, co-dependency, or something with having an anxious attachment.

&amp;#x200B;

I believed that I wasn't real and that my entire life was just some story that someone planted inside of my brain. Anyway, I smoked a bunch of weed, which is very very bad for people with schizophrenia. THC makes your symptoms WAY worse. I smoked in my room, while my parents and brother was home. Then it hit me hard as fuck. I started having a panic attack and vomited all over the floor. It was a fucking HUGE pile of vomit. I thought I was a robot. I wanted to cut open my skin with a knife to prove myself that I will find only wires and metal, not organs. I wanted to open my stomach and see if I even have organs. I wanted to get to the bottom of those feelings that i had. Eventually i called 911 because I was just freaking the fuck out and I thought I was going to die of a heart attack. The fire station, ambulance, and cops showed up at my house at about 10pm. I stepped outside and my family followed me. I was surrounded by cops. The medic told me to get into the ambulance and I walked over there and was taken to elmhurst hospital. They had me hooked up to an EKG. i was reading it while laying down. My resting heart rate was 150 beats per minute. I layed in the hospital until maybe 12 or 1am. They ran drug tests on me, it was just normal weed. It wasnt laced with some other drug. I thought it was laced with PCP because of how fucked up I was. My dad was in the hospital the entire time watching me trip fucking balls. Eventually he just took me home and gave me a speech.And THAT is why I never smoke weed that has THC in it. Moral of the story???? If you have psychotic symptoms. Dont fucking do drugs!! Imagine if I took acid or shrooms. I would have fucking killed myself because of how bad the trip would be.My mom remembers it. And she keeps bringing it up, she reminds me of the time I did drugs in the house. And I hate how she keeps talking about it. I want that memory to pass. She angers me whenever she talks about it.",07Mar2020,1
124,"I've always said things like ""I want to die"" or ""I'm gonna kill myself"".  Most of the times that I've said it, I didn't mean it, it was a joke. Depending on a person, they all reacted differently; I've went through a phase of saying shit like that to my parents and let me tell you, they did not like me saying it. They said that life is beautiful and that I live fairly comfortably, I'm not disabled or starving, my family loves me and I should be thankful for that to God. My friends on the other hand, the meme gen z, usually replied with ""lol"", ""xddd"", ""same"" or they would just laugh with me, because mostly, it wasn't anything serious. Now I see that because I said it so often, I got used to feeling like wanting to die and not really doing anything about it. Whenever I had suicidal thoughts I just kind of felt accustomed to it. They weren't foreign to me anymore. I suppose it's because there were times where I've said it and meant it. 

I'm not good with sharing stuff like that but I do overshare a lot. Like right now, for instance, literally publishing my entire life story. But even as I'm writing this, I feel like I'm still leaving out some parts of what I want to say. I'm not a direct person; I hate confrontations. And every time I've experience a desire to share my emotions with someone, I've chosen to keep quiet. I'm guessing that me repeating ""I want to die"" is a way of me hinting that something it off. In case where a confrontation about my emotions does take place I can't express anything. I don't know where to start. And when I start trying to put my thoughts together, I don't feel like I'm making myself understandable enough. This has caused me to retreat into myself. There was a time where I talked about how I feel with my brother and his wife (I have a great relationship with my siblings and their significant others). I know it wasn't their intention, but they made it seem like it wasn't that bad, anything out of ordinary. Again, me being unable to express my thoughts and emotions kind of made it hard for them to help me or make them understand, still, it made me feel like shit.

Many factors must've contributed to my current state; my dad was a mentally abusive alcoholic, I was brought up in a very Catholic household and I turned atheist (me and my siblings have this game, where we count as many religious symbols in a room as we can and whoever spots more wins; one room had 23 religious tokens), my parents are homophobic and I'm bi, I live in a small village and in a conservative community. Basically, my life isn't perfect, but at least I'm not starving. 

About that ""mentally abusive father"" part, he's still in my life. When all of that was happening I was very young and he stopped when I was 6. He went to rehab and hasn't drunk since. I've erased most of it from my memory, but now and then bits and pieces come back. We all forgave him and he's been trying to make it up to us. 

Some parts have stayed with me and continue to affect my life. I feel like I'm unable to love/be loved back. I'm not sure if that's because of the abuse but I think there is a link. Every time I develop a crush on someone I (again) keep it to myself. There was this one and only time, that I had told a boy that I liked him. I was 13 around that time. We became a couple. From the moment I let him know about my feelings, I had regretted it. There were nice times, but for the most part it was just me, being embarrassed about displaying affection. You may think that it's normal for kids to be embarrassed about feelings, but I don't think I've ever exited that phase. A year ago my friend asked me if I was dating this girl I was texting with. I did love her, but we weren't dating and as soon as I was asked that question, I panicked. I started stuttering how I wasn't into her or whatever. I remember how my mind went blank at the thought of us being together. It wasn't nice. Later that year I decided that I had to let her go, because not only she didn't love me back, but I couldn't bring myself to love her the way she deserved to be loved. I was okay with her only being my friend, as long as she's happy. We still talk sometimes and she told me that she has a boyfriend now. 

I don't know if I can blame it on the fact that my friends and I are becoming adults, but I've been feeling very lonely. Not the ""horny-lonely"" (but to be fair, that too) but the ""wants-to-deserve-to-be-loved-lonely"". I know I wrote an entire paragraph how I'm unable to do so but hear me out; people that are close to me are now entering a phase where they're interested in getting a s/o or they have already got one. They're entering relationships that aren't based on crushed anymore, they actually know and love the people they are with. You're probably thinking ""well isn't it the whole point of a relationship? to love someone?"" and you are right. But the thing is, I never had that. I see my friends be with people that find them interesting and want to pursue a relationship with them. And here I am, literally zero people have that kind of interest in me. And I wouldn't feel as bad about it, if I wasn't reminded all the time of how I can't have this. It's probably so fucking sad and cringy for you to read that but I really, really want someone to love me. I don't know if it's bc of the lack of love I received as a child, but I really care about that. I know that I can't love someone unless I love myself but I can't shake the feeling that no matter what I do, I'm not going to be loved. That I'm never going to be enough. 

If I already went so far in exposing my darkest secrets and you survived reading my overemotional rant, I think you deserve full transparency. 

There were a couple of times where I actually considered killing myself. I didn't go as far as actually doing it, but there were times I was about to attempt it. I always wanted a quick and painless departure, but I suppose you never have that luxury when you attempt suicide. I has to be painful, even for a moment. And I didn't want that. I believed that I endured enough pain in life so I didn't want to feel any of it when I was leaving. But there I was, trading a second of pain for a lifetime of suffering. Don't get me wrong, I never wanted to die but I wanted to leave and dying was the only option for it all to stop. I used to think about it a lot, begged God to take me away, that was during my time as a person of faith. Now I think about it a lot less but more seriously. I don't think of myself as strong enough to do it, but in a moment of impulse I don't trust myself. Still, the most likely thing to happen is me just living with so much anger and sadness to the rest of my days that I will regret not killing myself when I had the guts to do so. Or maybe I'll get out of it. 

Most people don't know that part of me because I pride myself in being the jokester of my group of friends, I'm said to be a good person; always helping those in need. And I know for a fact that I have a soft heart and I'm sensitive to other's suffering. I'm good at hiding how I feel because I can't communicate it. Most of the times when I feel like this I just power through, because what else am I supposed to do? My days are filled with me doing normal stuff, a panic episode/crying session and then back to going on with my day. I continue doing my thing and bad thoughts are just passing through. But when I am alone and I have nothing to get done, I just let all of this to consume me for a while. I cry, punch walls, vent online and when I have nothing more to cry over, I'm myself again. It has worked just fine, but I know I can't do that forever. I really want things to change.

135,"So it's super frustrating, but I'm a doormat. Like. Especially in situations where I need to stand up for myself. I just stay relatively quiet. 

I got myself into this situation with my current boyfriend's like. Grade school crush. And what I mean by that is he didn't like her but she was obsessed with him. Apparently 20+ years doesn't mean anything, because she's still kind of obsessed. 

We're literally about to have our first baby. And this girl has stayed a ""family friend"". She's acted uncomfortably attached to me since we've initially met. 

Last night it came to a head when we were all attending my boyfriend's grandmother's funeral service. She cornered me and asked for my number and I felt so put on the spot I gave it to her. She also proceeded to add me on Facebook and message me at 5 in the morning. Then whilst I've been at work she called me. 

I feel like I put myself in a Fatal Attraction position just because I couldn't just be assertive and tell her no. And the worst part is I really am a independent person and my boyfriend has to tell her to leave us alone because I can't buck up and do it. ;_;

I am generally happy. I don't understand? I watched a movie on Anorexia (to the bone) and it somehow triggered me because I had eating problems around the time I used to cut.

I can't stop thinking about it. My boyfriend has a nightshift and won't be back until 7am (currently 9pm). I never talk about this with him. I mentioned it once but I don't really like talking about it. He knows I get triggered from movies in which people are cut.

138,"I’ve never posted here before but I’ve been getting really weird things I’ve been doing and. I don’t know why I’m doing it

So a couple of weeks ago I was waiting at my boyfriends house and thought I saw something - I’m a big believer in ghosts and stuff so chalked it down to a spirit or something - then I heard someone call my name. Got freaked out, also chalked it down to ghosts.

I checked with friends and none of them (sans one) have ever felt anything in his house, so I was a little paranoid but I thought whatever.

I was working at my job and I thought my manager was behind me on the phone. I’m 80% sure he was actually there, but I turned around a minute later and he was gone. It’s possible he just walked past and I didn’t notice. Freaked me out though, I spent the rest of the shift worried that something was wrong with me.

I go to school and I check my locker. Some year 12s are putting shit in my locker. Danny Devito memes for gods sake. So I go ‘what the fuck’, to which a girl next to me says ‘oh the year 12s are doing it, they’re everywhere - just know you’re being watched’ and of course I went ‘what’ and she went ‘nothing’. Scared the shit out of me and I couldn’t focus for ages. 

I’ve told people about this and they think it’s funny, and they don’t understand how scared I am about this. Another meme appears in my locker. Freaks me out again. I leave it alone.

Yesterday, I went round to my boyfriends. Completely sober. We were lying in bed after I accidentally broke his glasses (which in itself sent me into a depressive episode,,, whole other topic). I suddenly started getting really confused. I’d say something and then half a second later I’d say ‘wait did I just say XYZ’ or ‘why did I say that’ or ‘i don’t remember what just happened’. When reminded I remember but just thinking back I can’t always.

It lasted for what seemed like 20 minutes and it was really freaking me out. My boyfriend just kept assuring me that I was just tired. I have been exhausting. The thing is, I remember that it’s happen before. I don’t remember when or where but I remember that feeling.

For context, I have depression/anxiety/ocd(triple threat lol) and have had for years. I have tried substances and have been drunk etc. I’m thinking that’s probably related - never got these symptoms before trying substances. 

I’m sorry that this is so long I’m just really freaking out and no one believes me. I’ve spoken to my therapist about the locker and ghost thing and I mean to talk to her about the confusion thing at my next appointment. 

Just really looking for advice and support between now and my next sessions. Any help’s appreciated.",07Mar2020,1

145,"Hello everyone. I've come to this subreddit in hopes that someone could help me find resources that could help me with my problem. To give you a bit of background information I'm the eldest son in my family, I live in Orange County, CA, and I need help finding a way to help my dad. For several years now, my dad has had problems with mental health. He's had several break downs over the years, but the worst has been this year. To give you more information about the break downs, they vary in intensity and frequency. The most minimal break downs are when my dad will leave the house and just walk around for hours. He won't tell anyone where he's going or when he comes back where he went. Other times, they are often more intense. For example, this past break down, he told my mom he had seen someone break the windows of his car (not true by the way). He also cried for an extended period, and then when he stopped he talk cursed at my mom. During the breakdowns, he'll usually talk about leaving my mom and us to be by himself. He will also talk about how people are following and he thinks someone is trying to hurt him. It's difficult to distinguish when he's having a break down and when he's drunk because sometimes both will happen at the same time. He refuses to seek a professional and get help but I'm really worried for him hurting himself or others. I'm not sure what my options are when it comes to helping him or there where I should start to look? Any point in the right direction will be appreciated. Thank you.",07Mar2020,1

I’ve been struggling my whole life to establish proper routines and habit to support myself in life, things like keeping my house clean, bathing, brushing my hair and wearing makeup, washing and folding laundry, getting enough sleep, etc. I’m able to just barely get by keeping it together but it seems like every once in a while after I’ve been maintaining these things better I slip right back to my bad habits again. I think this has a lot to do with my mental health and family background, but I’m not sure how to fix it.

Right now my house is a disaster with dirty dishes and vegetable scraps everywhere, I haven’t bathed in a couple days, my clean laundry is in a basket in the hall, my dirty laundry is on the floor, all surfaces are covered with junk, I have a pile of clean pillowcases and pillows I haven’t put together in about 3 weeks, my car is full of cans or paper, I’m only getting about 6 hours of sleep a night, there is garbage bags building up out back because I can’t even be bothered to walk it to the trashcan, etc. I feel very overwhelmed and disappointed in myself for this. I was doing well keeping up with this basic stuff for a few months but now am slipping back to where I was before.

My counsellor has recommended planning out my days by the hour, so I bought an hourly agenda but can’t seem to commit to it. I only ever seem to clean up and do what I ought to when there’s pressure, like someone is visiting my home or it gets so bad I can’t handle it anymore and do a large burst of cleaning all at once. It’s just me and my dog in the home. (My dog is well cared for and loved, though I realize it’s probably not good for him to live in a mess either. I always ensure nothing within his reach is harmful).

Has anyone gone through this? Does anyone have advice for conquering this? I want to get to a place where these things aren’t constantly issues I have to fight through and force myself to do, where I just do them out of habit and to keep myself happy and healthy. How does one establish a baseline routine? I seem to need so much time to recharge when I’m not out (maybe once a week) or at work that it overruns all the basic care.

Thank you in advance for the help!

TL;DR: I’m struggling to keep up with basic home maintenance and self care. Looking for advice to overcome this and establish healthy habits and routines so that I can do these things without thinking and don’t know where to start.",07Mar2020,1
149,"So for the past 10 years or so I’ve had really bad depression where I’ve acted out very manic got myself into debt didn’t care about anything just wanted to either die or be reckless. 

I’ve never had any structure in my life until 3 years ago. I got a job I love, Met someone, got out of debt and am functioning normally. 

Now, instead of my depression I obsessively put myself down whenever I do ANYTHING wrong. For example, if I speak to someone in a rude tone (even if was an accident) my inner voice for the next week will be like ‘you’re a piece of shit, you deserve to die’ etc etc or if something goes wrong I’ll be in a downer of a mood for weeks. I’m constantly scared that my life will go to shit again and have this overwhelming need to be perfect

152,"it seems to be stuck in limbo. I was real bad last wednesday and got dragged to speak to a support teacher. I've been told to get a doctors appointment sorted but i really don't know what to do because I struggle so much with talking to people. Theyve called me once to say that they're going to get back to me about getting an appointment BUT i missed the call later due to being at home and not wanting to pick up in front of family. 

ill try and call back monday but I don't really see the point because what if they just shove therapy in my face again like I've had 6+ years of my life for it to never work. ive tried it recently and it didnt work again. and since it was not CAHMS it isn't recorded medically

i hate talking to people about my problems. it makes me cry and feel sick inside. 

i dont even know what's wrong with me. teachers think its anxiety, I think its something else due to me not having very many panic/anxiety attacks other than for presentations. could also be depression but I've not self harmed in 2 years ish and i havent had a suicide attempt. i don't know what's wrong with my head.

155,"Alright so let me start at the beginning:

Growing up I was raised by two bipolar guardians, my mom and grandma. Throughout the years I had to deal with the emotional backlashes from them up until my early teen years.

It wasn’t until around 2013 I noticed my mental health started to deteriorate. I am fairly certain I have some form of psychotic disorder, but I am afraid to get help.

I currently take Sertraline to help lessen anxiety and depression. I mostly don’t want to be an inpatient, seeing as how I don’t function well being locked up or isolated.

I’m really scared shitless.

tl:dr I’m scared to get mental help due to being locked up in a psychiatric ward.",07Mar2020,1
156,"Hi, so there’s a chance that I may be sectioned and put into a mental health hospital for depression and anxiety. However, I’m terrified as to what this actually entails. I’ve visited family in hospital before and have been told the basics of how it works by said family. But as a 17 year old I’m petrified as to whether it’s actually ‘worth it’ I guess if that’s how you’d phrase it. I’m really struggling and people, including myself, scared for my safety hence the hospital. 

So just wondered if anyone could express their experience, let me know what is and isn’t allowed in hospitals (such as personal items - eg. teddy, phones to contact family, books), and or how the system works inside??
Many thanks",07Mar2020,1
157,"I trying to fix myself, for example stop lie, so i trying first time to tell story about my real life and not lie (at least anonimus).

I from east europe. My family not rich, but i always had home, food and i think even love. I will tell things i thing inportant for me.

My father then i was kid punish me around 0-3 times per week. I think i was good kid who was very active and who make a lot stupy mistakes. Thats why then i was kid i lied always a lot. First time then i felt lie is good was in 2 school year. Somethink happen and i with teacher go out of class. Don't remember if she cry before or after, but i told how it's hard for me, becouse ""father lost finger"" (it was lie). My feeling mixed about this event. I have problems with bullying me, but it wasn't hard for me. I had friends, my best friend and i was good student (avarge my result was \~8,6 till 9 school year)

Secound big lie witch i remember was with my best friends friend, i liked her so i told a lot fake story about myself and everyone. I think i remember this becouse it didn't worked. it was in 9-10 class

My life started fuck up in 8 school years. My parents started divorce in hard way: 2 years process, 18 police calls, runing from our home to live in ""help centre"" and so on. We started have money problems, but everythink worked in good way. I remember this moments then we all worked togever. After 6 months ""family protection"" blocked my father from living in our home and after 6 months everythink was almost ok.

I was studying in art school. Also my mom was teacher in same school. With new school year, i organized class party in forest and from this moment i started drink, first time didn't comeback home becouse i found nice girl in concert :) Becouse our school had many room to practice, we drinked in school, miss lessons and so on. It was fun moments.

I started missing about 80+ lessons per semester. In 10 school year i lost best friend. He didn't wanted share music cd, so i stolen for a day and copy it. He saw it, after he few friends teached me ""lesson"", i told about it for director. All class started protect him and at this moment i thinked my life is ending, but in same week my happen even bigger disaster. My granny die. I didn't come to school about 2-3 months.

I not remeber much, but then i comeback to school, my goal was to stay repeat school year, becouse my music teacher told me i will never get in university, so i wanted get more time. For me teacher was like a father and i think it was biggest mistake in my life :( So i convinced my mom, i want move to other school where my music teacher learning and i did everythink to fuck up my school, becouse i wanted to reapeat year. But becouse my mom was school teacher, she fixed it.

After i moved to new art school i lied about my class and they taked me in same school year.. They didn't check my papers, just trusted my word (i not joking). This school was worse, but had much strong music students from my instrument.

After i started study, most people was from my perspective losers. Everythink was easy for me. Everyone was drinking and smoking so i join them. In winter i found love in internet 300km away and i started autostop a lot and miss lessons. I missed in first simester around 50+ lessons, in secound \~150, gf left me and after a lot drama i was expelled from school.

I had grandpa in my girlfriends town, i got idea to move here. I worked hard and got to good art school. The idea was to show how good i'm for my ex-gf. For my family this big city was last place where i could continue my studies so they supported my again. With first school papers i got to 11 year school.

Started my golden year. Before semester i found way how to make money on the street, started party nonstop, got a lot friends and so on. In new school i come like rock star. I had amazing music group and had many activities non stop. I found 2nd GF in my class for 3-4 weeks after i left her becouse i didn't started it and i started to be boring with her. After i left her, i had problems with class again school again.. but before i also was missing lessons, just now started even more. I think first semester i missed \~80, and secound \~140. Again a lot drama in family..

After i fuck up, i comeback to my home town and i was trying to finish last 2 years in adult school. I didn't told about it for anyone. In this adult school nobody care if you are in lessons or not, just tell them u are working and you not need to go. So i lied and i always was drinking, parting and autostoping every week from 700-1200 km to play with my band, meet friends and so on.

My look i think was 4-5 max, but i found gf who i think was 10 (now she is profesional pole dancer). We were able to be togever 3+ years. I lied to her a lot about my past. For example i told, i before was drug dealer and so on.. I told many good real stories, but it was not enouth for me. I was hiding fact, i was studing in adult school for a year i think. After i told, but don't know why. She supported me.

After i finish studie i with my family moved to other country. After few months GF left me and it was hard time for me. I was not going to language lessons, but i didn't wanted learn stupy language with idiots who can't read so i was played everyday 11-16 hours in small music school. My family thinked everythink is ok, until they got info about me from school. After this i started learn in curses for working in shop, but at the same time, i registrated to university and i manige get in. In university exam i lied to profesors how i had punk green haircloth (actualy i had only long her and only 1 times i painted them...)

And i thinked again i'm superman, relaxed and started play computer games. In summer i got weight from 95kg to 115kg. University was not in english, it was language witch i know only basic things. First lessons was easy for me, but i didn't feel in right place. After main music teacher pressure i didn't come back. I stay at home and played games until I was expelled from university. I still didn't told for anyone about it.

Now i'm 160kg and 30 years old. I never worked in my life, living on minimum money whitch i get from my mom. She thinks i finished university, working, just can't surivive without help. I know this gona finish, but i wish to live like this more.

I had idea about killing myself but i don't want to die. I know i will always find they how to be piece of shit and keep my lies safe forever, but i wish to change.

My plan is:

1. Stop lie and learn to say things who I really am and can be proud of myself.
2. Start doing sports, becouse now i can't normal move..
3. Find fucking job.

But it's almost inposible and i trying to find way to do it.

I feel bad about many things, but i think i'm not bad person.  
I not feel bad about lies, i feel bad about not being good in some situation. I can't delete them or accept it.  
I don't know how to work. For now everythink i have is my moms money..  
Shit live i have now is ok for me, it's hard to imagine somethink better..  
I hate school.  
I love music, but i can't listen it anymore without hating everythink about it.  
Now i writing from 20 square room with 4 month trash and beetles.

So ye, my life and i suck :) But maybe some good advice will come also i want to see people reaction to my life.",07Mar2020,1
158,"I was bullied since I was 3. When I was 4, a girl I tried to be friends with told me she hated me. By the time I was around 7, I believed that the concept of a friendship where your friends “have your back” and want to spend time with you was a ideal fantasy created by the media, because I was often warned that media portrayals of romantic relationships weren’t always realistic. So I thought that since other children always preferred to insult and exclude me and never showed interest in treating me in a positive way, friendships as seen in books and television must’ve been made up like magic and superpowers. My parents encouraged this idea and told me I expected too much from other children and that if nobody wanted to be nice to me, it’s because something is wrong with me and I must be a bad person. I’ve had psychiatrists who were abusive as well.

I struck it lucky when I was 14 and got a really amazing friend, I can’t believe how unbelievably fortunate I was. It’s been hard to learn how to be social and talk to another person so late in life, but he’s been exceedingly patient and supportive. A lot of people haven’t had this luck and never got the opportunity to live. My friend lives very far away in another country, but he is wonderful.

I’m 16 now (I am aware that I’m technically still a child). I still have severe depression. Sometimes it feels like I can’t remember that I have a friend, as though my mind is stuck years in the past. Sometimes I find myself struggling with really simple social things that are expected, because I just don’t have the experience to recognize certain mistakes and it makes me feel stupid. I miss my friend because he lives so far away and I have no chance of meeting up for years. Being at school and being surrounded by people who get to be with their friends makes me feel envious and miserable. It frustrates me that most children have always had friends. 

Has anyone experienced a deprivation of friendship in their childhood? It feels like there are no people who have experienced this and gotten better. I see a small amount of people who never had friends but are adults and still never recovered from the isolation and angst, and this terrifies me. I hear about people who were bullied or lonely for periods of their life (usually in adulthood) but never of someone who didn’t make any friends until past 10 years old and managed to live a full life today. 

It feels like there are so few people who were friendless as a kid, and it feels like there are none who actually recovered from it. Can anyone give me some hope?",07Mar2020,1

I'm not trying to depreciate people suffering from these diseases as all are serious, but I had hoped I would be understood. Instead, they started treating me like crap for my delusions.

I’m pretty sure I have OCD, I’m always repeating shit in my head and in real life, and I often wash my hands until they bleed. I’ve had an ED in the past, and I’m kinda relapsing at the moment since I have a 2 week break from the outpatient ward. I probably have seasonal depression or some kind of bi-polar disorder too, I’m either unmotivated, tired, full of suicidal thoughts and overeating, or getting my life together but then falling into the “depressive state”, I don’t really know, again. I wanted to kill myself a few weeks/months ago, I don’t really know how much time has passed. I forget a lot. Periodically, I get anxiety over dying and shit.

I’m so fucking ugly and I’m not confident at all. I just want to hide, nobody wants to see me. It looks like I have Down’s syndrome or something, when I actually don’t. I want to get plastic surgery as soon as I can afford it. A nose job, something with my lips, my forehead, my eyes, my cheeks, my jaw. Everything.

On top of my ugliness, I’m also dumb as fuck. On a scale from F-A (F=failing, A=good), I’m at an E. I’m so fucking stupid. I wish I had something to be proud of, but I don’t. I’m only good/mediocre at starving. I like the feeling of starving. The feeling of being thin.

I also can’t draw, play an instrument, sing, or do anything like that. I don’t have any hobbies. I’m fucking empty, but still so full. I’m full of shit.

My dad also fucking hates me. He yelled at me today for removing a piece of fucking avocado from my plate to another one on the table. Ge makes me feel like shit sometimes.

I will try and keep this short. Maybe I’ll go into greater detail in a future post but for now I have only have a few questions.

Does anyone find great comfort with their depression? I feel like every time I’m in a situation where I feel some happiness it’s almost alien to me. I don’t feel comfortable with it and my brain automatically pushes it away. Depression feels like home and when I leave it for even a short period of time I get home sick.

Do genetics play any role in any of it? My Dad struggles with depression along with what I’m pretty sure is bipolar disorder. I find a lot of my habits and mental issues to be very similar to what he deals with. If you were to compare us side by side it would be almost identical and this worries me. Because of his mental illnesses he has turned to alcoholism. Since a teenager he has been drinking heavily which lead to my parents divorce and many other things I have seen which still stick with me to this day.

Last question. Does medication really work? When I was going to counseling medication was always recommended. I was prescribed prozac and a couple other things I can’t remember. I tried them for a short period of time but never stuck with it. I’ve always leaned towards the idea of being able to fight this on my own with out medication. I just want to know if it is possible to do so or if medication would be a better route.

165,"TL:DR - How do you deal with the feeling of Loneliness and it's amplification of self-doubt, especially when you bottle your emotions up.

&amp;#x200B;

Without going into too much detail, I (29M) went through a lot of emotional trauma in my early life - people walking out on me, deaths, bullying etc. and from a young age I always had the typical male mentality of stiff-upper-lip, chin-up, put it to the back of my mind mentality. What didn't kill me, made me stronger... If only.

What didn't kill me just made me my own worst enemy. I hate everything about myself and I struggle to think positively - but I'm not depressed (yet). I became so good at numbing emotions and not feeling things that I'm just now understanding how unhealthy it is. I feel like I've been filling up a trash can inside my brain and it's beginning to overflow - and I'm not sure how to deal with it. 

What's sending me over the edge though is this - I've always tried to do the right thing and be a good person. About 8 months ago, I chose to end a long-term relationship because I wasn't being fair to my partner. She was an amazing woman and I didn't want to cheat or be unfaithful, but I no longer felt the same way or could reciprocate the much stronger feelings she had for me. I knew the fairest thing to do was to call it a day. Being in such a long term relationship and making this change made me feel guilty for leaving her and putting her through that, and it left me very alone.

Recently and unrelated also, another woman led me on (nothing serious) and dropped me seemingly out of no where. Leaving me feeling rejected and slightly ashamed/ embarrassed.

Then there's my self-esteem which is just rock-bottom. Plain and Simple.

Essentially, All these strong emotions that I never learned to deal with healthily - low self-esteem, guilt, embarrassment, rejection - are all building up and usually I'd find a way to take my mind off it, but Loneliness seems to be a great amplifier and I can't deal with them anymore.

If anyone has any recommendations, other than talk to someone (which I really don't mean to be rude...If I could I wouldn't be on reddit) I'd hugely appreciate it.",07Mar2020,1
166,"I have no idea what to do with myself..... My life just feels very screwed up and I don't know why. I'll try my best to explain and hopefully there is someone who can offer help.  


I was diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome (Autism) when I was 21 years old and struggled a bit trying to get my life on track since then. I was diagnosed so late because I didn't cause problems in school, but I still showed some signs which was caught by my mom's best friend. And after the diagnosis, we tried to get disability for myself but it was troublesome because I haven't gone to the doctor for anything like this before. We kept trying and at the same time I tried to find a job to work like anyone else, but still struggled to get hired at any work place. So back and forth through the years I have been denied disability and a job. They say I don't qualify for disability because the government believes I can work, but I can't work because of my Autism. I don't quite understand......  


And on top of that, I do have these mental/emotional breakdowns. It keeps me very depressed and have a short fuse when it does happen. I do have some friends to talk to about it, or to help me forget about it for a while...... But there are also people on the internet who take advantage of my pain. I even had former friends just abandon me after my breakdown and turn around and harass me for it even though I did apologize after I calmed down. It makes me very scared of meeting people now and even more scared of losing the friends I do have now because of my breakdowns..... I lost too many friends already....

167,"I have a hard time understanding myself. My empathy seems to fluctuate, It’s not always completely there. For example, when the bushfires were at their worst, I donated $20 and cried over it because I was so empathetic towards the animals. When I heard a story about some people in China putting a dog into a wok while it was still alive, I was angry about it. When my mom came into my room to tell me that her brother had died and she was crying I was immediately responsive and I hugged her and told her I was sorry. But then there are days where I am sort of empty and I don’t feel any empathy. Those days are lessening overtime because I am being medicated with mood stabilizers so I am more empathetic than I used to be. But there are still days where I seem to not quite understand myself. when I was younger and when I was a teenager, I had some kind of conduct disorder which I’m sure a lot of you know what that means. I don’t want to talk about it though since I feel a lot of guilt over it. I feel actual guilt, this is not me thinking “what is guilt?“, I genuinely feel sorrow and empathetic over it.

168,"I thought this would be something to help inspire those who struggling with ADHD.

I live with ADHD, depression, anxiety, and always searched for a way to deal with it all. It's something that never really goes away, but finding a positive outlet to express myself has been a huge lifechanger. I recently learned that creating art with polymer clay is extremely therapeutic for my mental health. It gives me something to focus on and allows me to share my creativity with others. 

It's kind of scary because I've never made a video showing myself and talking about personal issues. So, even though this was very difficult to record (and it took me over 20 times to finally get right), I feel good about using video blogs to stay focused, inspire others, AND to share my polymer clay creations.

I may not be the most camera friendly or smooth with my words.....but hopefully a few people will still enjoy.
