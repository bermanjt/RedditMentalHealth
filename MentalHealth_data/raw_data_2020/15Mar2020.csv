0,"Hey Friends!

So I work with a community that is dedicated to helping individuals with suffer from Mental Disabilities. The community is spread out into five houses, with each containing 4-7 Mentally Disabled individuals.

So with my house, me and 4 of my other co-workers, are basically in charge of the same 4 Mentally Disabled adults. We basically share life with them in their house, clean their houses, play games, drive them to places they wanna go, and keep them happy and engaged. It's a great and lovely job (especially with me being a Senior Psychology Major)!

So here's the problem. There's this certain member named ""Jenna"" (not her real name; for confidentiality), and she always nitpicks on ""Nina"", on EVERYTHING she does. Like Jenna basically hates every single thing Nina does, whether it's talking about her favorite movies, telling jokes, or telling me facts about Dolphins. Jenna basically treats Nina like she is superior to Nina, and this evident in her authoritarian tone-change when asking her a question and feeling like Nina's mistakes interfere with Jenna's life (when obviously... They don't).

They are both 29 years old and Nina has the utmost patience and holds strong with Jenna's hurtful comments. What I will like to ask, what can I do for Jenna, who has a mental disability where a part of her brain was removed, to tell her not to treat Nina like she is ""beneath her""?

Thank you for any empathy and support!",15Mar2020,1
1,"If not, were you able to retrain your brain to regain these abilities? 

Research seems to indicate MDD diminishes abilities in 7 cognitive domains: attention, response inhibition, verbal memory, executive function, cognitive flexibility, decision speed, and information processing.  


I read many recovery stories, and try to follow their advice, but still find myself greatly diminished in the cognitive functions, which impairs my ability to feel integrated into work, social, and overall qol.",15Mar2020,1
2,"A lot in life I find myself always having a hard time making decisions. Especially when hanging out with friends and I'm asked what I want to do or watch. I can never make a decision and just tell them ""I don't know, I don't care"" in fear of rejection in my taste of what I want to do I suppose.. anyone have tips on this? I know some of my friends must get annoyed with my indecisiveness.",15Mar2020,1
3,"Have you ever considered how the actual Corona crisis effects the mental health? 
In Italy for example people have to stay at home the whole day and there are many people that live by themselves so they have nearly no social connection. Of course these people can phone or text with their friends but that's not like meeting them in ""real"" life, so these people could start to feel lonely. Also humans worry a lot about their grandparents and their school education, that's not good at all for the mental health.
In the last centuries we got used to going out for dinner, going to cinemas, discos etc. and now more and more people have to stay at home. That's a quite big change, it's not easy to get used to this.
But whatabout people with anxiety disorders, that are very afraid of infectious diseases or depressives that have no chance to try to work on their depression by doing sports or cultivating social connections because they have to stay at home? I suffer from OCD, I'm really coping with obsessive thoughts about the Corona virus, it stresses me so much that I decided to stop reading or watching news about the virus because it triggers my OCD.
There are many more examples about how the actual Corona crisis effects the mental health. I just hope we will get through this well.",15Mar2020,1
4,"This is the first time in my life I’ve realized that some people really just should not be around. I’ve been trying to find a purpose and be happy since I was 10. Nothing has worked and I’m honestly just...tired. Of being let down, used and hurt. My family? Uses me only for money, I thought loaning them money and buying them things meant I would get love back but once I couldn’t anymore I was useless. My friends? I had so many friends from JH-HS who turned out to be just my greatest bullies. I would try to branch out and meet new people but by senior year I was eating lunch alone in the bathroom by myself, hiding from everyone. I’ve only ever been in 2 relationships, both of them had cheated on me/abused me. Both of them were long term. My career? I feel stuck and I can’t leave because of financial stress. I feel so trapped in my life and so alone, let down and scared that I’m honestly tired of it. I have no one to talk to, whenever I bring anything up it’s ,”Well your fault that’s on you.” But like...I KNOW it’s my fault I just want to vent but I keep getting shut up. People only talk to me when I drink because I’m a funny drunk. I have been self harm free for 2 years and binge/purge for 6 months. But I feel like I want to go back and this time I want to end it all.",15Mar2020,1
5,"At the moment, I am just so overwhelmed by everything going on in the world (and in my life). My university is moving to online classes which I really dislike for several reasons, many of my international friends are flying back to their countries to be with their families, concerts (usually one of the happiest places in the world for me) I bought tickets for ages in advance are suddenly canceled or postponed, the panic shopping completely messes up my grocery shopping schedule and discourages me from even stepping into stores, my spring break vacation will likely not happen and all my sports practices are canceled too so basically all the fun things are not happening right now and I really don't know what to do. 
My boyfriend just told me that I've been spending way too much time on my phone lately and I'm trying to change it but right now, I feel like my head is just too busy dealing with everything. In addition to all of this, I'll get my wisdom teeth removed next week and I already had two panic attacks from just thinking about it. I normally handle changes quite well but at the moment, I have a hard time adjusting to everything because too much happened all of a sudden.

If anyone has some tips on how to handle this, I would be super grateful. 

Also, I would definitely appreciate suggestions for some fun hobbies/activities to try in the mean time, preferably involving no phones. I'm a woman in my early 20s, unfortunately not very artistic or creative and I enjoy sports and programming.",15Mar2020,1
6,"Today I made no money as a server. The restaurant opened while all this chaos about the corona virus is going on. It was a solid six hour shift of nothing but occasionally getting a customer, but I essentially left with twenty dollars in my pocket. It wasn't a good day. I went home feeling kind of down and was waiting for my girlfriend to head back to her place after work.

When she told me I could come over, I did and it felt like a mistake. I walked through the door and she asked if I wanted to join her in a few drinks since we both had a bad day. I agreed to it. She told me that she was going to have friends over the next day, which is fine. I like her friends. They like me. I thought ""Finally some company this spring break. New people to talk to."" Then she told me that she would like some time with them herself. I then realized, I don't have anybody else to spend time with. Everybody is out of town or busy. I started to feel really bad. I told her that was fine. I'll just stay at my place. I was very sad about it. She picked up on it. Told me that her negativity is not good for her. That we were both in a fragile state. I got the feeling she wanted me to just force happy. I can't force happy. She just kept repeating how negative I was and how it might bring her to the verge of a panic attack, because she's prone to those and I kept feeling worse and worse, then eventually I just left. Told her that I'm not someone she should be around if she is going to be set off by my state. She asked when I will be back. I told her I don't know. Right now I just feel so bad. I'm trying to drink it away, but it feels like its all my fault. I'm so sad guys. I just want it to go away.",15Mar2020,1
7,"Hi! I'm quite new to reddit and mental health communities and curious to hear about like-minded persons.

I am over 25 and have been suffering of a paralysing agoraphobia for a few years. No job, back to my parents' place, friends all far away, the idea of leaving house for ""unsafe"" places makes me sick (so no outside activity)...
I enjoy being fed, having my family around and time for hobbies, but it is not enough to make me happy anymore. I am trying hypnosis with a pro.

I know something deeper than the phobia is ""blocking"" me from improving but I can't figure what. After a very painful commute in february, I even started considering death as a suitable solution if I don't improve, thoughts that used to scare me. I haven't had future plans in years and don't know what I even want except healing.  The self-loathing is so bad I don't want/feel like improving skills or exercising. I am however not depressed (I sleep, eat, do things and am generally not sad, etc.)

I have good parents I see every day, good friends and a good long-distance partner I message often, but none of them can help me. It feels lonely and helpless, enough to rant online like this, haha. I used to be functional and my life is currently hopeless.

Is it abuse to share such dark feelings with the persons who care about me? Would rejecting my partner/friends for their sake be reasonable to protect them? Do you have tips on therapies that could help with agoraphobia? Does anyone have experiences about phobia making someone consider dying? I am open to any experience or support you guys feel like sharing.

Thank you for reading this!",15Mar2020,1
8,So I talk to myself A LOT. Like I will catch myself talking to myself inside my head but unintentionally I will move my mouth. Almost like I am reading a book and mouthing the words. I will have full conversations with myself and then I snap out of it and am disappointed that no one is actually there. I am not sure if this is healthy. I have done this my whole life and I feel like it is just a coping mechanism because I often feel alone. I have friends but I am always their second or third choice. I live at college with 3 roommates and when they tell me they arent going to be there i look forward to it because I know I can talk to myself loudly with no judgement. also i daydream a lot and it feels so real. Just posting this just incase anyone else does this and also feels like its weird. Any advice/comments are appreciated :),15Mar2020,1
9,"I live my whole life. by feeling. I let it dictate pretty much how i live and who i am as a person. and this can be a wonderful, wonderful thing. it really can be. letting your heart dictate and choose where it wants to go is an incredibly freeing way to live, and I’ve always wanted to be open. just live wide and be open so that maybe people will be open with me in return. I’ve had more “stuff” to deal with and process and cope and break down and understand than i ever have in my entire life. I pretty much spent the last 9 months processing a dream like life altering reality that I happened to find myself in (I’m not going to get into it but I was in a hospital for about a month and pulled from school for about 3, and had my final consultation just today. A year later) I know it takes time, and i’ve healed so much and know and have felt. on such a wide range. it’s truly incredible. But sometimes it’s almost too much. i’m just wondering if anyone else out there understands what i’m talking about. and how to deal with living a life by feeling. and how i can protect myself without limiting the beauty and bliss that comes with feeling the world around you.",15Mar2020,1

I feel like everything that's happened to me for the past couple of months have been out of my control.

But inside I am falling apart. Last year I had a 4.0 GPA and this semester I am barely scraping my C- average that I need to graduate. I have random spaz attacks where everything comes out, and then I end up pushing my husband away. He tries so hard to get me through my attacks, but I somehow always end up making things worse. I hate it. I hate hearing voices telling me that I should kill my self. I hate knowing that everyone would be better off without me and happier not having to deal with me and my emotions.

I don’t really want to die. I love my husband and our children more than anything. But I feel like a huge burden. They walk around on egg shells trying not to upset me and I hate that it has to be that way.

13,"Trigger warning: self-harm and bingeing. I just needed to talk about my past and need help on what to do. I am not sure if this is the correct place, but here we go.

This is a bit of a rant type thing, but I just needed to get things off my chest. I am from the United States. I am a Sophmore in college and am starting to realize that I might have more problems than I thought. For multiple years in high school, I self-harmed. Even though I haven't self-harmed in years, I still have suicidal thoughts and panic attacks. I have idolized suicide multiple times, and have even considered following through, but I could never do it because I do not want to hurt my mom. My biological dad disowned me when I was 10, and me and my stepdad have had a lot of issues. We fought like cats and dogs, and he has single-handedly made me feel terrible about myself. My parents knew about my self-harm but never did anything. My guess is they didn't know what to do and/or didn't want to make the problem worse. I have had bingeing issues since I was 12. When I was 13, I got really into pro-ana websites, but at 14 I started seriously restricting and bingeing. I use to eat so much and felt like I was out of my body. I remember one time I binged on a loaf of stale bread, and have eaten so much multiple times where I have puked (I never purposefully purged, I was just so full it happened). I have been bingeing for years, and still do to this day. I will spend up to $50 dollars on cheap food just to eat as much as I can. In college, I have felt suicidal, but haven't relapsed on self-harm. Just a lot of bingeing. I have never been able to hold down a friendship because for one reason or another I cut people out. I cut them out of my life and isolate myself. I have had and lost so many friends, it is so frustrating. But every friendship breakup is because I chose to do it. I have never told a soul about my bingeing, no one outside of my parents knows about my self-harm, and I have NEVER told ANYONE about my suicidal thoughts. To be honest, I have always avoided deep relationships, and have never had a boyfriend.

My mom is an alcoholic, and tonight she almost chocked. She was saying things like, ""you don't understand my pain"", and it clicked in my head how mental illness runs in my family. And maybe how all the loneliness, sadness, pain, anger, and problems I have had in my life isn't because I am bad or wrong, but it is because I have something I have never sought help for. Maybe I don't need to feel this way and life can be beautiful. Now there's just one problem. I am in between colleges, broke, but want to seek help. I do not think that right now is a good time to bring things up to my parents, and would rather do it on my own. Any advice?",15Mar2020,1

16,I take lamictal as my main mood stabilizer. I was taking 100mg in the morning and 200mg at bed. I've been on this dose for 2 years. It's been changed to 200mg both morning and night. I've never had a reaction at all on the medication. Today is the first day I took it in the morning. As far as I can tell no reaction but good old anxiety is like what if you take your night pills and react in your sleep and you don't wake up for help. How likely is it that just this increase will cause a reaction? Would it happen on the first day? It's been just over 12 hours since I took the first morning dose of 200mg.

Think of it this way - you know those tall ""high striker"" machines at amusement parks, where you hit it with a hammer and try to get it to go all the way up to 100? I can only get it up to maybe 60-70, and it just plateaus from there. That's my ceiling where I stop, and I can't get passed it, no matter how hard I try. I can only get that much energy, and then it just stays the same or goes down until I sleep.

I sleep because it feels good, yet I'm also forcing myself to sleep simultaneously. My body wakes me up, telling me it's time to get up because the sun has risen, but as soon as I do, I feel like shit and is sleepy and unproductive all day. I can't win. Oversleeping, undersleeping, and getting that 7-9 hours all just feels the same, and it's getting worse slowly over time.",15Mar2020,1
18,"According to my psychiatrist, I have childhood trauma.

I was diagnosed with depressive disorder. I agree that I am depressed but that only covers half of the issue. 

1. I get overtly angry at people who do not deserve it. I'm irritable at times. 

2. I have very few friends. My social life was never good because of some abandonment and relocation thangs. I know how to talk and ""make friends"" but never stick through with the relationship because I'm use to being left and i don't like people who i truly let in leaving. 

3. I get really hyper from nowhere and it can range from a day to 2 days, I think. I'm absolutely high on life and feel unstoppable. When like this, i get quite scared, I sweat and peers look at me odd. This might happen 2-3 times a month.  I don't do anything crazy like spending all my savings. Then I have a sudden mood shift.  

4. I have these realizations that I'm hollow.  In the sense you think (empty) and then ""hollow"" as in I don't recognize my hands. I do not feel attached to myself almost like a dream. I'll eventually wake up from a coma. 

5. I go elsewhere. Dissociate. I zone out and go away quite often.  When walking,  driving,  talking,  etc. This happens quite often in a given day.  

6. I do self harm and have ideation but have never made any plans.  I also consume alcohol to numb these emotions.  Honestly,  i don't why i consume. I just know it makes me feel better. 

7. I have a significant other who is unaware of my ideations, except for the depression. I try to act normal and not express how i really feel because i don't want to scare them.

25,"I’m underage and living with my parents. I have no car, and no means to take my dog to the vet. She’s recently developed multiple sores/ulcers on her throat and is bleeding out of them constantly. I have begged my parents to take her to the doctor, and was told that it’s not a big a deal. When I started crying because of it, my mother told me it wasn’t cool of me to say that I think we should take her to the doctor because she’s just a dog and not worth the effort.
This dog is literally the only thing in my family I look forward to seeing because my family is one of the largest negative factors for my mental health. She’s like my baby, almost eleven and just a little younger then me. I’m literally gagging/dry heaving and sobbing with the thought that she’s hurting, or may possibly die. I don’t have access to any sort of therapist and the mere thought of her not being here anymore has been one of the biggest strains on myself for the past ten years. I’m already severely depressed and if my baby died I would be literally broken. I know it’s going to happen eventually and I should accept it, but I’m literally always paranoid about it. When she’s laying on the floor while I’m drinking tea or reading, I will stare at her chest to make sure she’s still breathing. Every time I come downstairs and I don’t immediately hear her I think she’s dead. I can’t imagine what’ll happen to my already unstable mental health if she passes.

I can’t talk to anyone about this because my family doesn’t care and I don’t want to weight this on my friends. I can’t even enjoy myself around her anymore because she’s always bleeding.

It's been 6 years since this incident and I am only now beginning to realise that all these problems could be connected to that night.

27,"I have this inner conflict. After talking to people with major depression resistant to treatment who have recovered, I feel like I wanna move on. They had severe depression which had no relief, but they recovered. I start to think, I shouldn't have any insecure attachment or codependency issues. I can move on like them, even if my appointment is postponed 2.5 months. The other part of me is thinking, can I move on from having an insecure attachment style to my mum? I want to be mentally stable and go overseas to work, go to the countryside, explore the bustling city. I want to ride scary rollercoasters again without getting too anxious. There is life outside a hospital and constant outpatient appointments. Probably black and white thinking. Its not an either or thing. I was so ready to move on, I managed to stay on for months on my part-time jobs, things were going well. Like I knew I got to a point where I didn't have serious self harm urges or suicidal ideation. I felt like I was healed by God too. (Christianity). I hated some parts of my past, but I loved some parts of my past: the clubbing, the rollercoasters, the events which I went to. I hated being bullied or left out or failing academically. But I loved it when I could actually excel in the modules I loved, and I could write about cool stuff. I was so ready to break away from the identity and labels people have given to me. But there are some events and situations which will bring me to feeling useless again. And stupid. Like accountancy or being in a social setting where I don't feel welcome. Like I feel, how hard is it to wait 2.5 months for the next appointment?

I’ll love myself or think I do for a few months but then something happens like I gain weight or my crush rejects me and then uses me. Then I lose my confidence all over again and spend a lot of time consciously and unconsciously picking out flaws and trashing myself. And then when I try to change and get apps that spread positive and promote self love, it’ll work for a second, but then I get so stuck in my ways that it seems almost impossible to actually love myself. 

I feel like I’m on a infinite journey of improving myself and getting to a certain point of achievement and if I don’t get there then I’m not good enough. For example my weight. If I’m not skinny, fit, or if I gain weight back that I’ve worked so hard to lose, then I’m not good enough or pretty.

If my grades are lacking and are a C or lower then I’m failing and I’m not good enough. 

I feel like I need to be a certain way in order to love myself. I feel like I’m in a constant state of trying to fix myself. Anything that’s negative about me has to be fixed or I’m not good enough. And I feel like if I’m not in this state of mind then I’ll become lazy and let myself go causing me to not achieve my goals making me worthless. 

I’ve also found myself in situations where I avoid relationship or go for guys who don’t like or care about me because I feel like I’m not in the headspace that I should be in order to be in a healthy relationship. I feel like I need to be super confident and love myself and I’m not that and I’ve never really been like that ever in my life. So It feels like the possibility of being in a healthy relationship is impossible for me because I can’t seem to love myself. It’s like when I try to love myself, I get angry that I’m giving myself love and mad that I’m being compassionate and just irritated. And I don’t know why. It just irritates me and I prefer to help others instead. 

It also feels condescending when people tell me I need to work on myself because that’s all I do. Is work on myself, try to fix myself. I’m literally trying to improve all the time. And I make improvements but not on things that I want specific improvements on. I want improvements on my self worth! I mean it’s cool that I’m more social and a little bit more open and it’s great that I’m doing things that are out of my comfort zone, but I’m still self loathing 😡 and it’s making me upset! Why can’t I just love myself? Why is it so hard to do? Why does it make me feel irritated whenever I do give myself love. Like I actually hate doing it.

30,"Recovering (I don’t know what’s wrong with me)

It was only since a year and a half ago that I stopped hanging out with abusive friends. Yet I still feel pain

(This’ll be really long)

I used to be in a group of girls that loved gossip and the majority of our conversations were about boys we liked. We’d spend a lot of our time talking to each other about our crushes, but because of all this focus on romance stuff, they’d get into bad habits (lying, insulting each other, etc.) which turned into hair tugging, screaming at each other and emotional manipulation. They’d always target me because I was the “jokester” of the group and I was always playful (just kidding or playing around). Even my own best friend would make threats to me. We’d do each other favours where if we got gossip about each other’s crushes, we’d trade for a bit of money. She’d eventually go on to scam me and occasionally steal my money. She’d then threaten to tell my crush lies about me (that I hated him, that I was a horrible friend) and I was so scared. Idk how I didn’t see through her empty threats till later, cause she’d threaten me every other day. It was so emotionally draining and I’d cry almost every other day. 

I think I finally lost it when I spent my last Halloween with them. They weren’t doing anything they’d promised (they promised to me and another friend we’d go out a bit) and when I was getting tired of them just sitting and gossiping, i told them I was getting bored and “when would we go out?”. The group’s leader snapped at me after I was getting tired, and she kept repeating to me “why are you so selfish, you’re so whiny and childish” and she cussed at me to the point where I cried. If you ever met her back then she’d scare the sh-t outta you. It was awkward for the rest of the group so they just watched. (I was a weak person before don’t judge please, I cried easily lol). The leader of the group was the most aggressive one, and was ironically, one of my longtime friends.

I think one day in summer I kinda finally snapped. I guess my brain had enough of the bs I was going through, and I completely changed after going outside for once-  . It was literally just one faithful day in summer, I cut ties with my crush (he turned out to be manipulative too, since he’d play around with me and three other girls’ emotions), I removed myself from the old group, blocking them and never speaking to them again. I reconnected with another old friend who introduced me to a new group

I love my new group so much they’re literally the best. But even after the year and a half, I still kinda feel the whiplash the old group gave me. I feel so bad. I’m supposed to get over it because it was all so petty, but it felt so emotionally draining that I feel like I’ve got a huge void in me now 

It’s not easy when the friends you had to let go were people you knew for 8+ years

Currently I’m fine. But I feel emotionally drained (a bit), really low energy, and sometimes I’ll stop my hobbies for weeks at a time. I’m really into art, and I’ve been having a major creativity block for 3 months now, which I keep hating myself for. If I stop a hobby for too long, I’d lose my practice and get weaker and weaker. I can’t stop having low self esteem

My confidence has gone up, but just because I’m confident when talking to new people doesn’t mean I have a high self esteem. And sure people joke like “oh yea I’m a bummer” but I literally can’t tolerate myself even when I’m doing nothing and everyone says they’re fine with me. 

I feel randomly stressed, not in social situations, but just thinking about the future, or thinking about everything I do, and how it could possibly hurt me in the future, I can’t stop. I hate it when my stress leads into physical pain (stomach, chest, muscle? Pain). I’m always stressed about wether I make people upset or not just by tiny actions (like if I joke or if I accidentally mix up something). The worst feeling is when my stomach feels like it’s sinking into me. Like there’s some sort of invisible pressure. 

Remember the friend I mentioned earlier that I’d trade information we had on each other’s crushes with? She’s still my friend now. But I don’t even know how to feel. Ever since all the drama stopped, she looks disinterested in me, our conversations are always awkward, and she still hangs out with the old group occasionally. I’m so freaking frustrated at myself because I’M the one who started talking about my crush in the first place. We used to have so much fun and now it feels like I’m talking to a shell of someone I know. She doesn’t like joking around anymore. Was I only interesting because of my crush situation?? 

Lastly I hate being so defensive. Whenever I see a story of someone online getting away with so much manipulative sh-t, I can’t help but go on rants and get angry for hours because I know what it’s like to be hurt by someone like that. One of my My online friends struggles with depression severely and when she got into a fight with an extremely popular fanartist, it only made her depression worse. I keep texting her to comfort her because I now know what manipulative people are like and it just makes me so sick. I’m scared that my defensiveness will make people think I’m crazy. When I hear about things like the Zoe Quinn and Alec holowka situation, petty online artists drama, or anything involving a sensitive topic dropped in the middle of drama, I can’t help but get upset, and I don’t want people to see me as this grumpy person that hates others. 


I’m so sorry this was so long but I’m honestly so tired of feeling really empty and I need some way to pick up my attitude and get happy again. I need to have some sort of motivation other than “oh, well just try” because I keep trying and I’m still stuck. I’ve been stuck for a while. I also need advice on how to regain motivation for my hobbies. Yes I draw occasionally, but it’s not as much as I wish I could do. When I see artists online pumping out 10 sketches a day, vs me that’s now on 2-3 per week, I get upset at myself. If anyone can help, please do. I really want to try getting better

32,"I have times where I feel really bad. I shut myself down. I go quiet, and I won’t say anything unless it’s not a yes/no question. It’s hard for me to smile or laugh. I sink into a bad place where I wish I could just disappear. I don’t want to do anything. I lose motivation. I stop caring about myself, and my future as much. I don’t eat at much. I isolate myself. I feel like a burden. Like people just tolerate me out of pity. I convince myself that nobody cares. Even the people who have shown the care plenty of times. Sometimes I feel angry. Sometimes I’m sad. Sometimes I don’t feel anything, which is the worst of the three. 

I was in that state for months. Starting in July, and gradually getting worse until it was really bad in late December. In Early January I suddenly got better. Started caring a little, and managed to feel happy and laugh and joke around. Started to turn back into me. I was happy that I was getting better. Though maybe I wasn’t actually getting better. I have days where I feel bad like that for no reason. I sink right back into that place. When I have a bad day, it’s pretty bad. I mean that as in, I immediately go back to wanting to disappear. Just vanish. My good days are where I’m able to be more of myself. My bad days are when J want to vanish. There is no in-between. 

I have some days though where I start off good/bad, and then by the end of the day, it swaps. It makes me feel like a bad person. I’m afraid people see me as just a moody person. As someone who has an attitude. The truth is on those bad days, I’m falling apart inside. I’m being torn down by myself. I’m not trying to hurt anyone else when I go quiet. I’m not trying to seem rude. I just can’t get out of my own head. I can’t convince myself that I have a purpose and that people actually care. I feel so bad about it. I feel like everyone is judging me when I have a bad day. I feel guilty, ashamed, and pathetic, which just adds on to how I already feel. I just wish someone would see that I’m struggling. I know people aren’t mind readers. I just wish someone could see that something isn’t right without me having to blatantly say it. I can’t blatantly say it. I’m too afraid. Someone did see once. They reached out to me. Helped try to get me professional help by talking with my parents. But what did they do? They gave me false hope. They kept saying they were looking for a counselor. I asked them. Multiple times. I asked if they were still looking. They said yes. Months later and nothing has happened. Not a damn thing. I get angry just thinking about it.",15Mar2020,1
33,"It was only since a year and a half ago that I stopped hanging out with abusive friends. Yet I still feel pain

(This’ll be really long)

I used to be in a group of girls that loved gossip and the majority of our conversations were about boys we liked. We’d spend a lot of our time talking to each other about our crushes, but because of all this focus on romance stuff, they’d get into bad habits (lying, insulting each other, etc.) which turned into hair tugging, screaming at each other and emotional manipulation. They’d always target me because I was the “jokester” of the group and I was always playful (just kidding or playing around). Even my own best friend would make threats to me.

35,"A poem about my experience with Borderline Personality Disorder




There’s things In my mind 
that I sometimes struggle to find
things like who I really am
if I looked deep inside 

These Intrusive thoughts
keep invading my mind
and they lead me to believe
that everyone will leave me behind

There’s something explosive
inside of my chest 
emotions leak out
I can’t keep them suppressed 

Can’t tell what is real
I’m so dissociated
it’s like right after something happens
the memory is asphyxiated

I can go from pure joy
To exploding with anger
and its so hard to control
the impulsive behaviors

I have so many conversations
inside of my head
and theres someone inside of me
that says I’m better off dead

By the time I was fourteen
I’d made my first attempt
only a freshmen in high school
yet I was treated with such contempt

Now I’m an adult
and nothings really changed
except for being told
there’s a disorder in my brain

Now I don’t want any attention
but I need some affirmation
does anybody really care
or am I just a mental patient",15Mar2020,1

Whenever I’m outside I can basically only think about going home where I feel comfortable. I hate school I hate anything where I gotta be out with people for a long time. I always feel unlucky, I feel like everything goes bad no matter what happens even if I have no control over things they still make me so fucking annoyed I can’t stand it. I feel like I can never get some peace. I don’t know of any mental illnesses in my family
Because I barely know them but I was told schizophrenia ran through and I’ve never really heard voices or seen things but sometimes I feel mentally ill with myself I feel like my thoughts jsut don’t match a normal person. Everything I do is so fucking sad and I can’t cry so it feels even worse.

40,Hi for years now I have struggled with depression and finding my place in this world. I don't have many friends and I have immense trouble finding new ones. I have been doing some research and I share some of the symptoms of bipolar II like having unbearable depressive episodes that last as long as two weeks and followed by self destructive ones that cause people that might have been my friend to distance themselves from me and I really am trying to look for an answer.

For the past few years, I haven’t felt like myself. It’s been so long that I don’t even know what being me is even like anymore. I used to be able to speak and have conversations with people, it was great. Now I can’t talk to someone outside of a professional atmosphere even if I tried. I feel like I’m very very alone, even if I’m in the company of others. It feels like I’m in a pit with people lining the edge with their backs turned; they’re all talking and having a good time. I’m at the bottom of the pit too scared to make a sound, almost as if someone’s covering my mouth. 

I don’t know what I’m so scared of. I really don’t, but social interaction just paralyzes me these days. Even when I do have interactions with people, I talk like I’m at a job interview. I can’t help it, that’s just where I default. I want to meet people, I want to speak, I want to do so many things, I just can’t. 

It feels like I can’t connect with anyone. Nothing about me matches up with the rest of me, if that makes sense. This makes meshing with any group very difficult, because no one in said group can relate to me. I want to reach out, but every time I do I feel an emotional pain so intense it starts to feel physical. I just don’t know what to do about it.

44,"I’m 25, female. I have always enjoyed spending time alone, in fact I pride myself in being my own best friend not for any social problem but because I genuinely enjoy my solitude and being alone with my thoughts. 
I noticed a few months ago that if I isolate myself for too long I tend to get sucked into my own thoughts where my mind becomes a toxic unbearable place, that I just want to run away from myself. It starts off positive while I recharge my introvert batteries reading a book, painting or watching a show, really enjoying my solitude. But then it tapers off to a compulsive recollection of memories and racing thoughts and gradually I slide into plain depression: no energy, sadness, obsessive thoughts about past hurts and trauma, the sort of things that leak into my consciousness and I usually avoid thinking about because I obsess and can’t snap out of it so easily. 

Now, four days into working from home and this social isolation from the whole virus chaos, even though I’m with my roommates and digitally in touch with my close friends, this cycle is starting to happen again.

45,"What do you think about all of this?
I am not okay, and have just come to terms with this fact. Everything is getting worse mentally, and has been but didn’t notice until a few days ago. I opened up to an online group of people in a game called VR Chat (Virtual chat game). By opened up I mean I got scared when they came to close and started to breathe really heavy and beg them to stop. I thought this was normal until they asked why I reacted as such. I just stated that it is normal for me, no worries. They then told me how it wasn’t normal to have panic attacks. I didn’t  know that not being able to breathe and freaking out + hiding was a panic attack and told them that if that was a panic attack then I have them every day, which I said jokingly. They then proceeded to converse (two guys) about how I may have been abused sexually or physically. I respoded by freaking out for an unknown reason and they helped calm me. When I got off the game I started to realize that no one around me reacts to things like I do (sometimes have panic attacks for no reason to).
My online friends (I don’t trust anyone irl) told me to get in therapy. This is almost impossible by the lack of a phone, car, family member assistance, or place in my town to go to. 
At the beginning when I stated that my mental state is getting worse I kinda meant I can’t control myself anymore. I do not believe in online tests and are nothing like the real thing. Yet a month ago (before opening up) my symptoms for all and anything mental related was high, today every single test I took came out 1/3 times stronger than a month agos.
This tells me that I am spiraling down really fast from purely opening up to someone. This means that there is something wrong and I am not self diagnosing that came out positive. I am solely stating that maybe it isn’t normal to score so high on the tests.

&amp;#x200B;

A friend of mine who's always been very open with me facetimed me recently and I'm very worried about her. She 's obsessed with a guy who's told her in the past that he likes her, but lately he's only been talking to her so he can keep fucking her. She told me she's only happy when he acknowledges him, and that's becoming less and less frequent.  She's never been a very serious person, and so as soon as I try to step in and help I can almost guarantee I'm gonna get pushed away in &lt; a week. She's also high from the second she wakes up until she goes to bed, so nothing I say will be taken to heart. I have two concerns: 1) she's going to hurt herself (suicide is unlikely). as she told me that she hurt herself for the first time a couple weeks ago. 2) she's going to move onto more dangerous drugs. I have no chance of getting her off weed, but if I can keep her from switching to a more dangerous drug, and make her happier, that's a win. She doesn't have a good relationship with her parents, and I don't know them well either, so going through them isn't really viable. She has a sister, but her sister doesn't like her much (and that's not from her point of view, I've seen it in person). Her friends are all weed smokers and partiers. I myself have never done a single drug/gone to a single party, and really the only reason we're still friends is because we both used to be mildly depressed, and we think each other is nice + funny. She refuses to acknowledge that there's a problem/she should get over the guy, and I don't think the guy cares about her much, so going to him isn't really an option. She's really athletic and so is almost never busy, and her parents are semi-anti-medicine, so therapyy/meds isn't an option. I'm all out of ideas, but I'm really concerned for her.

* Animals - they're all awesome, say no more. 

* Sport - anything from F1 to football (British) to cricket. 

* Politics - I'm quite a free thinker and tend to hold opinions on a case-by-case basis so I dont really hold a specific set position but I'm willing to talk to people from anywhere on the political spectrum. 

* Psychology - anything from serial killers to theories to social experiments. 

* Documentaries - anything from mental health to conspiracy to natural disasters.

I also remember my mom sexually touching me a few times when I was younger. And I didn’t understand at the time, but it fucked me up. And it is probably also part of what caused me to do the stupid stuff I did as a teenager. I don’t know if she was on her meds or what when these things happened. But when I talked to her about it, she says that it never happened, and that she would never do that and yada yada.

On top of all this, I was homeschooled and socially isolated all throughout my teenage years. Therefore, I have no social skills, and I don’t know how to make friends or talk to people. And I’m extremely lonely. 

They’ve also made me work for them from a young age. From the age of 11 or 12, I would help do construction type work or work on cars etc. and now at the age of 18 almost 19, my knees are jacked up and my health is deteriorating, and overall I just feel like an old person. 

Speaking on health, they’ve also never taken it seriously. I haven’t been to the dentist in over ten years because they didn’t take me to even get them cleaned all this time. And now I have a mouth full of crooked teeth and cavities, and I need to find out how to fix them since I’m 18. 

I’ve also noticed some symptoms building up and I’m getting worried. Ever since a young age, I’ve had a swollen lymph node behind my ear. I’m starting to have difficulty swallowing. I’ve noticed that I have double vision. One side of my face is dropping as well.

This has me worried because I have a family history of Muscular Dystrophy, Autoimmune Diseases, Arthritis etc. my mom has multiple chronic illnesses including Myasthenia Gravis. My Grandpa Died from ALS. My uncle has fibromyalgia. My grandma died from cancer.

I just all around have horrible genetics. And I’m worried that there is something wrong with me as well. And I can’t get checked or anything because I just simply can’t afford it.

There is also mental issues I’m dealing with that I can’t afford to get checked yet. I’m sure I have ADHD, obvious depression and anxiety. And who know what else.

Everything just feels hopeless. I don’t know what to do. And I just can’t take it. I feel like I’m cursed to live a life of pain. And I honestly just want to end it all. I really just want to die.",15Mar2020,1
53,"I found out I was adopted a few months ago. I’m 19 years old. I found out from my bipolar aunt who told me through text. My biological father is my adoptive mother’s first cousin. It was determined I would be adopted while my birth mother was pregnant, so my adoptive parents started the adoption process when I was a few days old. 


I also found out I have two sisters. I went and visited them about a month after I found out. They live across the world. My sisters are 21 and 16. They’ve always known about me. In fact my entire family- aunts uncles cousins even my two neighbors and best friends knew since we were 5 years old. 


When we used to visit India, we would meet sometimes but they kept my older sister away from me because we look alike and it would’ve confused me. 

A couple years ago I even found a video from my 7th birthday where me and her were dancing together and I didn’t question it at all even though we looked like twins. I remember thinking “yeah genes are crazy.. second cousins totally can look alike” I guess I never had a reason to think otherwise. 


I’m having trouble processing I think. Everyone told me I’m handling it well but to be honest I don’t think my body processed until after I came back from my trip. I’m processing everyday and it’s so hard because I don’t have someone with me all the time to talk to. I’m an only child. 


My adoptive parents love me a lot I know that. I think I’m having a hard time to process because it doesn’t feel like I’m adopted. I’ve been given so much love by everyone in my life. 


I’ve been FaceTiming my older sister.  Trying to continue to form a relationship and bond with her. It’s easy to talk to her. I have trouble when my birth mom takes the phone away and talks to me. At this point of my processing, I don’t want to talk to her. It makes me uncomfortable. She expects me to talk to her like I’ve known her my entire life. 


They’ve known about me forever but I really just found out and I need time. I can’t just form a bond with you magically. 

It upsets me when she does that. I also gained 15 lbs and with my face chubbier I see the resemblance I have with my birth mom and it unsettling. I think that’s because I convinced myself I look like my adoptive parents for 20 years and to finally see my self look like someone else is really weird. 


I don’t know. There’s so much going on in my head and everyone thinks I’m fine but I don’t think I am. I can barely focus. I’m pretty much failing all my classes whereas I usually get A/B grades. 


I saw a post on Instagram with a friend and her sister and the captions read: “the greatest part about having a sister is being able to call her my best friend” 


That brought me to tears because I don’t feel that way with my sisters and I want to be able to. It’s so hard with them being across the world and me trying to process and deal with what I’m feeling. 

It’s hard because although we’re sisters I’m afraid our relationship will always be that of cousins. 

Things at home are a little difficult too. My mom is bipolar and has depression. She takes her medication but sometimes she’s difficult. My parents don’t really consider my mental health and they prioritize my moms. I feel my mental health is falling apart and no one is taking me seriously to the point where I can see a therapist or a professional and get help. With my moms condition it makes living at home a little difficult and makes it feel suffocating. 

Earlier today I told my mom “I hate you when you act like this” and in hindsight I should’ve chose different wording but her response was “I know your older sister is teaching you this” and that BROKE me. Because first of all, my older sister is so sweet and respectful. My moms known her forever it’s her cousins daughter.  And it makes me feel torn apart and helpless. It makes me feel like I can’t try and form a bond with my sister because my mom feels whatever she’s feeling.

54,"I don’t even know where to begin with this. But just life is a disaster. The mental pain, consumes me everyday. Getting to me. The thought of Chelsea is always there. I gave my all to her, she was always first, I did so much for her, always made sure she was okay..... she never did the same for me, never ever. She was my priority. I gave her so many chances, but she kept destroying those. Made a lot of promises to, to me about how she loved me, wont get with anyone, but still did. Lied to me, destroyed my heart. Going through one of the worst heart breaks ever at the moment. I can’t stop thinking about her. Just the thought of her with someone else kills me inside, I know she doesn’t know this is on my mind. This is all I think about. Doesn’t help that suicide is always there as well. Knowing there’s always another way out helps. “Just overdose...... life doesn’t matter anymore. Life isn’t for everyone”. So many times I nearly have, but backed out at the last second. I really don’t know why, I truely, truely don’t know what’s stopping me still. School found out about all the suicidal shit, called my mum. Told her everything. Had to tell my dad as well. I think they think I’m a danger, school thinks it as well.... school isn’t doing a single thing to help, just put it all on me and my parents. I don’t know how much longer I can take this mental pain. Depression, anxiety. Everything, what’s the point. When all these haunt my body. Everybody thinks I’m happy but I’m not, here is my confession. Still love Chelsea so much, but, don’t think she feels the same. Too caught up in this other guy. I don’t know if she’s gonna message me, I don’t know if I want her to, to be honest. If she does, might just send her this paragraph. She’ll know how I feel. My family life is okay at the moment I guess. I’m just unlucky as hell. Having been sick for so long, got a concussion as well from a friend, all while I found out Chelsea got with someone else. I can’t take this anymore, crying writing this. Savannah, Eva, Nikita, Spencer all worried for me. But I don’t want them to be. I know I’ll be okay in the end. No matter what happens to me. Might go out on my own terms. Depression has destroyed my mental state. I don’t see myself recovering from it ever. Lost so many friends, depended on people too much. Maybe, I was the problem in my last relationship with her. Maybe she didn’t do anything wrong. Was I too dependent on her? Did I try too much? Was I obsessive? I don’t know anymore. Maybe I’ll never find out. “I love you so much. I don’t want anyone else”. “Nooo Joel, I won’t get with someone else in chaing Mai. I love you, and only you”. Hopefully the mental pain stops soon. Don’t think it will. Considering while writing this, just to take my own life tonight, tomorrow, whenever. I don’t even know/care. I have no interest in life anymore. No interest in anything. Just wish I was dead to be honest. Wouldn’t have to deal with all of this mental pain anymore. Wish my family understood how I felt, and just, just let me go. I don’t care if it’s selfish. It’s selfish to give my all to this world and still feel like nothing, still feel like a waste of time, money, space, oxygen. Whatever. Because that’s what I am. I don’t deserve any of this I have. That’s what makes me feel worse as well. Getting what most kids, what most people work their whole life’s for, and still just wanting to be dead. Sometimes I just, I wonder what I’d feel like to be walking to my bus stop and getting hit by a car, a truck, whatever. Just, all the pain. Gone in a split second. Sounds nice, really does. I don’t care what happens to me next, just as long as death happens. I can’t imagine being alive for another, 30, 40 even 50 years. Scares me to think I’m gonna be around for a long time. Going to make sure that doesn’t happen.  Drinking and taking drugs to forget the pain, half the time I can’t get this shit out of my head. Just always drowning in my own thoughts, pain, whatever.",15Mar2020,1
55,"So I have believe I have been suffering from depression for almost 1.5 years now (atleast I believe I suffer from depression) and recently I gathered enough courage to tell this to my parents and friends, they helped me, listened to me and I can tell that they do love me, but also they don't believe I have depression, they say I am just overthinking and it's all in my head and honestly I think maybe that's true, anyways I am not here to discuss about that.

For a long time now, I have been struggling with a very toxic and dangerous mentality. Basically I believe myself to be manipulative and a liar. It was because of these things that I got into an argument with my friend. I began to say nonsensical and confusing things, telling them to quit religion and to be your own man. Hell I even threatened to commit suicide if they didn't change... I feel very ashamed for this and since the parting, I yell at myself for being the way that I am now. I truly do hate myself.

But I want to change that. And this is a step I must take, but the thing is, I don't know how.

I don't know how to think in a more healthy mindset and I don't know how to make up to my friend for hurting them. Should I even make the attempt to try and apologise? They have blocked me on all platforms and I haven't tried to interact with them again since.

61,"I'm sharing this in hopes that it may inspire others to speak up and no longer be silenced.

Shortly after my 18th birthday, I made a profile on a dating app (I'm not going to say which one at this time) uploaded some pictures, came up with a cute little bio, and I was all set. At first things were pretty slow, not a whole lot of activity, it was boring to say the least. But one night I saw this one girl and thought ""Hey she's pretty cute, I'll give it a try"" sent her a message and at first there was no response, but the day after I saw that she had messaged me back. We got to talking and we actually had a few things in common, I thought things were going really well, it felt like I had finally found something good. So we talk for a few days and I eventually asked if she wanted to meet up and go on a date, and to my surprise she said yes, I was super excited to go out on a date with this girl, cause she seemed really amazing. I remember she had told me she was gonna take an Uber because her dad needed her car, which was understandable, I thought it was a little weird, but what could go wrong, right? 

So, the day of the date finally arrived and i was super excited, we were texting has we were getting ready and she said she felt super excited about it as well. So I we planned to meet up at a restaurant, I got there first so I was waiting outside for her, we were texting for a bit then she stopped answering me for a bit, I wondered why, well when she pulled up in her truck and not an Uber 10 minutes later, I had my answer. 

We go inside and get a table then we ordered our drinks and browsed the menu before deciding what we were gonna get. So we both order, get our food about 5 minutes later, and start talking and asking questions to get to know one another. We finished our meals, I paid the bill, then we drove over to a Starbucks across the street and had some coffee and hung out in there for a bit. 

Now, again I wanna give a trigger warning before this next part. *TRIGGER WARNING*

We get done at Starbucks then she asked if I wanted to ""fool around"" in her truck, and being the freshly 18 year old I was at the time, (this was December 2019 I had just turned 18 on the 11th) I said ""yes please"" we got into her truck, drove to a semi-secluded area and proceeded to make out in her car. Now, since my eyes were closed, because i""m not weirdo who keeps his eyes open when kissing someone I didn't what happened next. We're kissing and next thing I know, her pants and underwear were off and she was on top of me. At some point during the kissing and stuff, she managed to remove the bottom part of her outfit within not even a minute. She got on top of me then got off for a quick second and proceeded to forcefully pull my jeans off, then my underwear, and since I had no control over the situation, I was fully erect. After pulling my pants and underwear off forcefully, she proceeded to stick my dick inside of her. At this point, I already knew I was being raped, I already knew what was happening. And since her truck was a confined space, I had no where to go, if I made noise she shushed me, has she raped me. she was pushing herself on me so hard I was pinned against the passenger seat, trapped, with no where to run. About 3 minutes before I was about to ejaculate, I told her ""shit I'm gonna cum"" she immediately removed my dick from her vagina and then stuck it in her butt (sorry for the crude wording but as I'm typing this I'm reliving it) she was riding it so hard it kind of started to hurt, next thing I knew I was cumming inside of her butt hole. It was not pleasent, she knew I was a virgin and she knew she could trap me. I sometimes still blame myself for putting myself into that situation so blindly. But, what's done is done and there's nothing I can do to change what happened that day. 

If you read the whole thing, thank you. So much.",15Mar2020,1
62,"Throwaway account because reasons.  I have a boyfriend who I've been with for around 3 years and we are very close.  We enjoy the same types of video games and tv shows and enjoy playing them together.  But I have a problem I keep facing... I'm in college full time and he is part-time so he has more free time than I do so he is able to get further than me in games and tv shows.  At the beginning of our relationship, I showed him a game I really enjoyed and he became obsessed with it and soon he knew more about it than me and had beaten it many times over when I had yet to complete it.  Recently, I showed him a tv show I really liked and was watching it. He started watching it together and we really enjoyed it, since it was finished we could marathon it.  Yesterday he told me he finished watching it without me.  I didn't have time to finish it even though I was farther in it than him and was just watching older episodes with him but he finished without me.  

Both times I had just a feeling of hurt and depression and the feeling that why should I even bother.  It's gotten so bad I won't play a game I bought just because he got way too far than me.  Maybe I'm jealous that he has more free time than me... I feel so childish feeling this way.

63,"As the title states, I'm working on writing a character for a fictional story. I want to portray him as accurately as possible in regards to his past, and I'm having a bit of trouble finding good information for some of the details of PTSD and related disorders, and I'm having some difficulties understanding how some of it works. Specifically, I want to better understand what happens during PTSD flashbacks and how they work, how dissociation works, how isolation affects people, particularly children or people who experienced extreme isolation as children, how children respond to traumatic situations and how they're affected by PTSD, and what other disorders and symptoms can be caused by severe PTSD/DESNOS.

If you have information you'd like to share, you can reply to this post, DM it to me, or you can DM and ask for other social media accounts I have (Currently Gmail, Discord, Office 365, and Flight Rising) and talk to me through there.

The disorders and topics I need details, advice, and firsthand accounts on the most are:

\- PTSD and DESNOS (C-PTSD) 

\- Dissociative disorders 

\- Effects of sensory and social isolation

\- BPD (Borderline personality disorder)

\- Somatic symptom disorder

Some other disorders and topics I'd also appreciate information on are:

\- Acute stress disorder

\- ADHD (Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder)

\- Agoraphobia

\- Antisocial personality disorder

\- Bipolar

\- Depression

\- Self harm and suicide

\- Schizophrenia

Information you share won't be given to anyone else in context, and will only be used to better design a fictional character. If I mention any info given, it won't be accompanied by any usernames, defining personal information, or links or references to this post or any replies made on it. 

I don't work for any organizations, nor am I doing any studies. I merely wish to better understand PTSD and other related disorders and topics, and to be as accurate as possible in the portrayal of my character, as I feel a lot of characters written to have PTSD nowadays aren't as accurate as they should be. 

I will mention this subreddit in the acknowledgements of whatever media I decide on for my character's story.

If requested, I can post a spoilered comment including my character's backstory/source of trauma, if you believe it'll help in giving more accurate info.

I think I am too happy.

I was recently told I failed my Spanish oral examination, yet I feel no disappointment or anger or any desire to improve. I was lectured by my parents about my lack of drive and my 'fear of failure'. And I am still quite content.

I have an assignment due tomorrow, which I have not even yet begun. However, I feel absolutely no stress or dread... I even have the time to create a Reddit account to make this post. 

I haven't done any homework or studied at home whatsoever this entire school year. I am behind in my homework, my assignments are garbage, I'm probably going to fail... yet I still feel the same.

I am most likely going to fail in life due to a lack of drive, and I don't really mind. I don't care enough to take my driver's license test or to study for my exams in a few weeks, because I am content as is.

To me, the future and the past don't matter, I only care about the 'now', and now I am happy.

When I moved schools recently, I thought that it would be a good opportunity to start over, make new friends and become a better person, with better grades and a better future. Instead, I made no friends, I sit by myself during lunch and tap away at my phone. And somehow, I am content. I feel absolutely no urge to make friends. Occasionally, a teacher or a student walks up to me and asks me if I am alright, because the sight of me sitting by myself day after day must be depressing or something. I am absolutely not depressed, I am sure of it. I tell them I am fine, but I am not sure if they believe me.

I am useless to society, I have no talents and my only hobbies are reading, watching anime and playing games. And still, I feel happy and content and complete.

I live an incredibly comfortable life right now, despite my future being so unclear. I don't get bullied; bullies practically don't exist at my school (it is a very good school). My parents love me very much and I am grateful to them. 

I think if I was less happy, I might have some drive or some reason to improve, and my life and future would be better. But I feel no urge to improve myself or to work hard because I am satisfied.

If so, I think it's just a matter of time until we stop panicking and realize this is going to be a new biomarker of our collective lives. Just stay healthy, stay away from people with weak immune systems (for their protection) and soon this will be under control.

The economy will return to normal and there will be more opportunities for growth than ever before. But remain flexible. 

Remote work is the new normal. 

You need a new approach to productivity. 

Spending time with online communities is important as a proxy for our social life needs. 

Establish rapport with people who have the right mindset for your mental health. 

Avoid consuming social media in a dark hypothetical feedback loop; this will deflate your mind and eventually your body.

Stay physically active. 

Don't succumb to nerd neck by slouching over and developing tunnel vision from excessive screen time. 

Give yourself calming breaks. 

Do whatever it takes to stay lean and sane.

How do I get over this anxiety of not wanting to take them and just better myself and my mental health. I’ve been cooped up in this house for 3 days just depressed my family doesn’t care, cause to them I’m such a horrible person. I have depression, and pretty bad anxiety. But I guess to them I’m just crazy. They make me feel like some sort of lunatic for showing my feelings, when I never really do. I need to get better mentally. So I can get by financially and soon move out. I want to get out of this hellhole. I’m just wondering. I need help.",15Mar2020,1
75,"I feel like I’m going to relapse again with my ED bc I’m having more depressive and anxious thoughts again and have been very critical of myself. I make sure I’m still eating but it’s stressing me out more, the voice in the back of my head is getting louder and telling me to stop eating any fats or carbs, which ofc doesn’t make any sense. 

I’m scared I annoy my partner with having mental health issues. He doesn’t really get that I can’t just be happier, less anxious or feel better about my body. Don’t get me wrong, he’s very supportive and has seriously helped me on my journey to loving myself, I’m appreciative of him. He tries his best...and it is enough. 

But what if my mental illness pushes him away...I’m too worried to talk to him about it bc I fear it’ll irritate him. However, if I don’t talk I’ll keep digging an anxiety hole. 

I’m so lost man.",15Mar2020,1

78,"Everyone is a teacher, but that does not mean that everyone is correct.

There have been times in our lives where we have been a good example for those around us, while at other times we have not been a good example - if we recognize our own imperfections it helps us have compassion for all people and look upon all as equals.

Just because someone was wrong once, it doesn't mean they are going to be wrong forever. Similarly, just because we may perceive someone as wrong, it does not necessarily mean that we are right, in most cases we lack the perfect information required to make an objective and universal perspective.

It is important to remember that we are all imperfect and that we all live through the limited perspective of ego.

One may wonder, what is the right way to behave and live? As far as I know, it is to live in a manner that increases our personal freedom without harming others to do so - this is not easy, but we should certainly try.

Sending love to all beings. May we learn as much as we can from one another without making harsh and permanent judgments.",15Mar2020,1
79,"My name is samuel, I'm 19 years old and already for 3 years I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder right after I had psychosis which lasted 3 days. Since then I haven't been able to be a functional member of humanity and I've been living a very shit life. I can't overcome the smallest of steps and every rock seems like a fucking mountain. Not that I haven't done anything right, I teach kids english. It's literally the only fucking thing I  can do, just help those who can't help themselves, yet I'm left in a downward spiral which drags me down to the bottom of my bedroom floor, which is where I am right now. As a product of all of this I started writing a pretty fucking poetry book about how much I want all this to fucking end and how much I want to love life. I hate every single god damned fucking word I wrote into those 106 pages. It took me one year to put it all together and now I just want to fucking swallow every piece of paper I use to write on before I put it into my PC. Not only am I a complete fucking failure, but I know fuck all about why I am this way. It just entered my life and never left. I've been to the hospital three times, once because I overdosed myself and second time because I sliced my face up with a knife in front of a mirror. No scars left, luckily, maybe I should've gone a bit deeper. I'm trying, you know?  I've been a regular at my gym, I'm a really good looking guy, I'm told that very often, and I do appriciate it, I really do, but that's still not a reason to stay. 

My biggest step lately was that I got myself an emotional support cat. I don't want to get your hopes up so I'll just cut to the point - I feel even fucking worse. The cat needs more fucking care than I ever did. I  barely shower or brush my teeth or wash my hands. I don't give a single fuck about the whole ''COVID'' disease and listen to music all the fucking time. I daydream myself away far too often and I can't exist without something on my mind all the time. I can't stop thinking. I even took this stupid fucking personality test ''Myers Briggs'' thing. Not that it is stupid, it is surprisingly accurate, but for me, in a way that only dampens my will to exist. Everytime I  got the same result from multiple test I was put down crying on the couch with my phone in my hands. I  got the INFJ type, which supposedly is the rarest, and for me, most stupidly fucking retarted one. I don't want to be fucking rare in this shit mate, I want to be characterless like those people who simply cannot understand me are. They don't have to deal with this constant contretempt of sadness and total absolute fucking hopelessness. Tragedy has truly found a great companion, let me tell you that... What do I do, friend? Do I just drift away into the nothingness or continue trying and trying and trying? I don't know man... I'm just fucking exhausted. So. Fucking. Exhausted. I couldn't handle another hospitalization. It's just so horrible. I'm afraid I won't ever graduate, I'm not exactly a smart person, because I really don't see the point of me knowing things I don't want in my life. I do photography very actively, I go to the gym very often, I teach english on occassion and go to therapy almost every third day, yet, I'm just feeling desperate. No amount of medication amounts to being understood. And in this world of filth I feel like the biggest sack of shit that ever crawled across the already fucked up floor. I'm so low, that death actually seems like a viable option.",15Mar2020,1
80,"For the longest time I’ve felt so emotionally numb. There are things in my life that I should be happy for. That should make me not feel like this but a lot of the time I’m not really feeling anything but acting/feeling the way I think I should be. Everything I feel is more logical &amp; not actually there, this happened so I should feel this way. Instead of an immediate emotional response. I can’t even remember what being happy feels like at times. I’m always anxious about everything &amp; despite whatever good in my life I can’t feel it. There’s just this emptiness. If I could feel anything it would be sadness. Quite often there’s this wave of sadness that goes over me. I pretty much start to breakdown crying, pleading for the pain to stop, telling myself it’s okay, sometimes even hurting myself in different ways. It can last for minutes to hours but It never really goes away. There’s just always this sadness that follows me. I tried therapy but most times I didn’t even know what to say &amp; even when I tried my best to tell my therapist how I felt or what happened the advice she gave me never really helped. It’s gotten a lot worse now &amp; I’ve been thinking about killing myself for a couple weeks now. This isn’t the first time I’ve felt this way but I thought I was through all of that now. I keep thinking about how I would do it but I can’t imagine leaving my wife with such a burden &amp; to hurt her like that but sometimes I can’t bear it &amp; think she would be better off without me I just want to know what’s wrong with me so I can be better I don’t wanna feel like this anymore

I’m constantly anxious about everything that I can’t function properly, have panic attacks, emotionally numb, depressed, &amp; suicidal again but a lot worse off Unsure how to tell my wife

Plus I live in India which has 1.3 billion other people and it's close to impossible finding a lonely park around me. I don't earn so I live off my parents.

I'm the youngest and I was always belittled and made fun of for anything I said or did. It made me go quiete and never say anything in order to not sound stupid and be humilated. Also, I was sexually abused twice when I was 8 and less and I've never said anything about it to anyone beside my ex. It is catching up with me, the fact that people who are suppose to give me an unconditional love, people who are suppose to be always there for me, I can't share the littelest thing about myself with them. Trying to say to them that I'm happy or I'm sad feels like choking.

86," My mother is abusive, my father is a complete enabler and supporter, and the rest of my family is toxic and never believe me.

My whole life was dominated by fear and depression. The depression just got more and more severe, and now I've become so angry inside I barely recognise myself. My anger is a 9/10 nearly all day. I'm the most angry when I'm around my parents (I live with them). I have tried to reason with my parents and family to no avail. These days I'm so angry at my mother I regularly fantasise about all the ways she could die.

For years I've been finding ways to cope and survive with my depression and anger. They worked for a while, but my mind and body are simply exhausted from years of suffering. It's not that my coping strategies were bad, it's just that the suffering is too much. Two years ago my internal vocabulary started changing, and in my head I began swearing all the time. Over the past year the vulgarity has been slowly leaking out. I've started to become combative and argumentative with my parents whereas before I would censor myself and stay submissive. It keeps happening more and more and I can't stop it, even though I know it cripples my ability to be productive and might put me in a really bad situation. Plus my brother has literally been assaulting my mother as of late, and I feel schadenfreude.

I'm at my wit's end because my country is on lockdown due to coronavirus and I have to stay inside with my parents for possibly 3 weeks. Plus I have a repetitive strain injury that's making typing/swiping/writing painful. I do go to a therapist but we can't meet during the lockdown and there's no privacy for a phone call. And I am not going to be financially ready to move out until 5 years at least.

89,"I feel like I’m incredibly paranoid sometimes. This paranoia results in me not trusting people. I’m in a relationship but have this feeling like I’m being cheated on. Here’s why:

She wanted to get back on a dating site (it’s where we met) but only because of this promotional offer and said we could take the promotional money and have a nice date with it. I was hesitant but ultimately said ok. She said to set my parameters to a certain range so I could find her and then we’d have a quick back and forth then set up a date to make it look believable so if the app needed to verify. So we did that and never heard any response from the app. After a week or so I asked if we could delete it. She said ok and then had trouble deleting it. She wasn’t sure if it could be deleted while on pause and so it took me showing her how to do it before she could delete it. She is a tech savvy person so this doesn’t make sense. Also it took me asking more than once. She didn’t want to delete it initially because we hadn’t heard back from the site about the promotion. 

Also, a family member of mine had surgery and I wasn’t feeling good to go out and do stuff. I wanted to stay in. She went to a party a friend of hers threw and said she wouldn’t be there long. Said she picked up wine called Ménage a trios and said she would FaceTime me later. I never heard from her, fell asleep, and woke up to a text saying she lost track of time. 

Ménage a trios makes me suspicious because she used to date a girl, early in our relationship she seemingly out of nowhere asked how I felt about threesomes, and so this just feels way too coincidental.

She’s going on a climbing trip in a few weeks with 2 guys and one of the guy’s girlfriends. Due to the type of climbing it is I wouldn’t be able to participate since that’s not my skill set. 

When we’re together and when we talk she’s very comforting and sweet and assured me to trust her. She says she loves me. She’s very nice and she knows I’ve had bad relationships in the past but that I need to trust her. She says I can lean on her. I feel like I can but my past makes that hard sometimes.

I have felt rushed to make big life decisions with her (we’ve been together little over a month but we’re both older so maybe later in life relationships move quicker?) and I have pushed back saying it’s hard for me to make those decisions and I feel pressured. She backs off and says she doesn’t want to make me feel pressured.

I don’t know, sorry if this is all over the place but I just feel like I’m being super paranoid but I also feel like I have cause for concern. Am I just being too paranoid or is my emotional/mental health vulnerability being taken advantage of?",15Mar2020,1

95,"32 F for reference. I’m so thankful for this forum. So for the last week, upon waking up I hear what sounds like a stapler or nail gun to the point where I get pissed because it sounds like something loud preventing me from going back to sleep. Once I get up to go to the bathroom it’s gone. I notice it happens more so when I’m coming out of a vivid dream. 

Aside from that, for whatever reason, I’ve been more paranoid of pissing people off lately. I got diagnosed with a serious genetic health condition that has limited my ability to work as much as I used to physically (however I’m still working PT at my current job (which is a hospital) and starting up a healthcare company with old coworker as well as continuing my career in web design on the side), but had to move in with a family member short term so I can make close to what I was prior to losing my health. For record, my health has been an issue for awhile but has only recently limited me as much as it has so its not necessary new stress. With that being said, I get overly paranoid about upsetting the family member I’m living with or pissing them off or if I visit my in laws I over worry about the same - this happens off and on. 

As mentioned, I work in a hospital, so with the virus, it’s been a madhouse at work but I don’t feel I’m stressed about the virus itself (I’ve been working at a hospital almost ten years so I’ve seen Ebola play out too), however, maybe I am. 

Long story short, I don’t necessarily feel more stressed than usual. 

Basically I’m worried I have beginning signs of narcolepsy or schizophrenia. I plan on scheduling an appointment with a mental healthcare professional soon, but am worried with these hypnopomic hallucinations and slight paranoia, I’m developing something more serious. I do have a history of OCD (irrational fears of schizophrenia, cross contamination at work, etc. - basically massive “what if” syndrome) for some reason (even though I have a good friend who actually does have schizophrenia who functions fine for the most part). 

Has anyone experienced something similar and come to find out it’s just underlying stress? I apologize in advance for how ridiculous this sounds. Thank you in advance.",15Mar2020,1
96,"I lost my no self harming streak, it was going so so well. At every family thing my brother always humiliates me by making fun of everything I like, or pulls my pants down or hitting my privates. 
I was invited to my sisters and he starts poking fun at me for me being fat, losing my job, my self harming and everything I said. Then he kicked me so hard I fell to the ground he kept saying ""you have nothing dont there"" and laughing at me in front of everyone. I went straight home and cut my arm.
I'm so sick of being the family joke, I'm so sick of never fitting into anything. 

My ex girlfriend just used me for money and cheated on me for an underaged boy. 
I loved her so much I never saw the bad in her when we were dating, she came in an out of my life for over 2 years. She would just cut contact suddenly no explanation I thought I upset her, I got so excited for the random texts asking for phone credit or money.
Then suddenly wanting to see me, she told be she was dating another guy during time she cut me off.
I went 3 months without hearing from her suddenly she wanted me see me she invited me to a skate park. Like the moron I am I went, got there she was hanging around teenage boys no older than 15.
She was 22 and she didnt have a car or ID, she want me to buy them alcohol I said no the only time I said no to her. She demanded I stay and I did and she ignored me except when I was going to leave.
I felt like shit, late that night she came up to me and asked if I wanted to play hind and seek. After half an hour one of the teenaged boys came up to me and told me she was having sex with one of the other boys. 
I got up and tried to leave she got angry at me and she made me feel like I was doing the wrong thing. Said she wanted to talk after she had a walk. 2 hours I sat then a text she'll call me the next day.
3 weeks later she did what always did and cut contact, haven heard from her since.

I know I was an idiot for staying with her for as long as I did, she was my first girlfriend and only.
My mind always makes relive that almost every night. 
I started LARPing a year ago, to he social again try and meet someone. I've probably done something weird without  knowing but all the women just didn't want anything to do with me. I just wasn't making friends. Until I met Rob, he said lets start a faction ""Drunken guard"" he said we go 50/50 kept asking for money I kept giving it. There was always an excuse on why he can't pay his half. I couldn't afford anymore, he start not talking to me, then he asked if he could pay me out for my half, he never did. The LARP group got super toxic no one role played with me found out Rob was gossiping about me. November last year I stopped going. I wanted to kill myself had plans. I've been pushing myself so hard this year to get better, I went a month with cutting myself.

Why does my mind kept hold of everything bad thats happened, why do I hate myself so muc, why did my brothers humiliation of me set me so so so far back?",15Mar2020,1
97,"I’m 20 F. I’m in college. Growing up, I was very shy. I had untreated social anxiety disorder that really got in the way of my ability to make friends, have a boyfriend as a teenager, and that sort of stuff. I finally got therapy and medication when I was 18 and I overcame it thankfully. 

Now I feel like I probably have depression. I feel like my brain just can’t ever let me be fully mentally healthy and happy, something always has to be wrong with it. 

Last semester of college was the closest I’ve ever felt to truly happy and mentally healthy. I had just transferred to a new college, I made a lot of new friends, joined a sorority, I had my first boyfriend. I just was having a really good life. It was really great. 

Then my boyfriend dumped me, my friend group dynamic changed some, I got used to the college so even though I still really like it it doesn’t have that exciting “new” feel anymore. I started to get depressed. I think a lot had to do with getting dumped. He really led me on and played with my emotions, made me really like him and think he liked me too, then dumped me and it was hard on me. Especially because I go to a small college so I have to see him around. And every time I see people post pictures with him my heart just sinks. Even though I wouldn’t get back with him now because he’s not the person I thought he was and I don’t think I really have the same feelings for him now I hate seeing him around or seeing pictures of him because it reminds me of everything and puts me in a bad place mentally. 

I didn’t like my class schedule that much. I started sleeping a lot and not eating very well or very much. I’ve always struggled with my self esteem and feeling like people don’t like me, especially guys, and so I guess once I felt like this one guy didn’t anymore it did hurt my self esteem deep down and it just didn’t help my already deteriorating mental state. 

I started to feel really sad and hopeless. And that’s where I am today, still feeling that way off and on. Classes got moved online because of the Corona virus so I’ve moved home and will have a month of basically spending it with my family doing my school work. I have good and bad days, but today has been a bad day.

98,"I have a doctors appointment this Wednesday in regards to this topic but having never spoke about it to anyone before so I’m writing it here to just put it out there. I’m unaware if this is even the right place to do so.

First of all to anyone who takes the time to read what I have to say, thank you 

The reason I’ve decided to post what’s going on here is that I literally feel like I have no one else to speak to. I really hope someone reading this has experienced anything related to what I mention here and can offer advice on what they’ve done to help themselves and in turn could potentially be the cause of helping anyone who is experiencing anything related to what I say here.

I’ve just turned 22, as of a few days ago. The only people who acknowledged it was my birthday was my girlfriend + her family and my family which I’m thankful for. Part of me didn’t care because I work nights so I went into my birthday working, I slept though the day and then went to work at night so I didn’t really celebrate it. I also saw this coming as there has been no one in my life apart from these people for the past 6 months. 

In regards to work,

I hate work. I feel my attitude towards it is in the gutter and there’s nothing I can do about it. It would be even remotely nice to do something I enjoy, the thing is I have no idea what I enjoy doing. I’m not passionate about anything and my life isn’t going anywhere. I can’t picture myself anywhere in the future. I recently tried getting out the gutter and make something for myself and I began to learn a trade using a company that I’m now trying to settle a case with using the Ombudsman service, long story short I was miss sold the course and it’s allegedly a scam. 15 % of my monthly wage would go towards this and over the year and a half span I was with them there was a large number of red flags. Which now puts me exactly where I started a year and a half ago, but with a debt of a few thousand to pay to my Mum, luckily she was in a position to be able to help me pay off the remaining settlement amount but I was heavily reluctant to accept it, this is now a huge burden on my shoulders because I want to be in a position where I’m giving back to my parents not taking from them. A regular shift at work often involves me trying not to have a breakdown and going home, I’m past the point of being fed up. I’m feel numb to a lot of emotions and at least once a shift someone drops a comment about how I’m always miserable or I look tired all the time. Then when someone asks how’s it going I just say okay as it’s the easiest thing to do and I notice they rarely care about the answer to the question they ask. My commute involves driving under a train bridge and I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t thought about plowing my car into it on a few occasions to try and stop the noise of everything. The only thing keeping me going was that I hate seeing my girlfriend upset and wouldn’t want to do anything stupid.

In regards to relationships,

As of very recent, my girlfriend of 2 years said we would be better off as friends which I saw coming as she had been off for a few weeks and it had nearly happened once in the past. I couldn’t of asked for a better first relationship. After speaking about it we’re now only calling it a break, because after speaking for every day for 2 years we had probably reached a point where there was the romance had faded and it wasn’t necessarily fresh. It was a new experience for us both as neither of us have had a relationship before. We’ve made so many good memories I’ll cherish for the rest of my life regardless of how the next few weeks play out. The girl is my best friend and while I never wanted her to feel this way and make her feel pressure from this, she is the only person I’m able to be myself around and the only person I feel I can tell anything to. My last bit of hope in this world and she kept me going on a daily basis. 
Me being a completely different person to who I was going into the relationship has to be factored in to us parting ways. I’ve constantly battled with insecurities throughout my teenage years and I guess they’ve just caught upto me at this point. 

In regards to confidence, self esteem &amp; insecurities,

My first memory of being self conscious was when I was on holiday with my family, we were stopping at a friends house and I compared my body type (Mesomorphic) to someone else who was an ectomorph. At this age (10/11) I knew nothing about these body types etc but I remember being upset by a comment from a parent. Then I started going out on my bike, became quite lean of what I can remember and at roughly 13, I stopped going out and put on a large amount of weight becoming insecure, introverted and my school work suffered because of this. I didn’t get good grades and ended up studying for a further year to then drop out at 18 to go full time at and train up to be a shift manager at a fast food restaurant for about 2 years. I hated telling people where I worked as it’s got a reputation to employ anyone and everyone. After leaving that job and getting my current job nearly 2 years ago I’ve been gradually losing weight and am now in the gym 3-4 times a week. I’m overly self conscious about my appearance, if I can avoid doing so I avoid pictures because I hate looking at myself. I know I’m going to regret this as there’s been many good memories that I haven’t captured with good people at that moment in time. I also struggle to go the toilet in urinals, I am physically incapable of doing so and this is probably the main reason why I do not go out anymore because I’m embarrassed to stand outside the cubicle and have to explain to everyone that questions why I’m stood there. 

In regards to friends,

Excluding my girlfriend, from my early teenage years, I feel I’ve never had someone I can call a best friend, it’s always been a group and there’s been good times don’t get me wrong but I feel to bond further than that there needs to be bad times that will make or break friendships to show who your real friends are. As of about 6 months ago there has been no one I can really call a friend, no one to speak to whenever I needed help. From the previous friend group, we all had different lives so no one was ever free at one time. I get as you get older people get busy but if taking 10 minutes out of your day to have a conversation about the well-being of someone you’re friends with to genuinely ask if there okay and listen to their answer is too much of an ask, are you even friends in the first place? 

There’s a lot more to say but I’ve gone on for long enough.

Thank you to anyone that read this far, I appreciate you and wish you the best.",15Mar2020,1

102,"Hello! I applied to nursing school beginning of January and I am waiting to hear back from them. I believe I am a strong candidate, I am applying to an associates program- I already have my bachelors in psychology, have taken 5 out of the 7 “recommended courses” (basically courses you need to take for the program anyways but they recommend to lighten the load during school. I have completed my TEAS, and a certified nursing assistant so I have healthcare experience and currently work in an inpatient psych unit. 

I find out sometime next week, but the wait is making me SO anxious. I am mentally preparing myself for the fact that I didn’t get in, not sure if it’s a coping method or what. I live across the country from where the program is, in my hometown, and really don’t like my job which is another reason why I want to start school.

103,"So I’m a teenager, and I’ve been having thoughts about dying. A year ago, I was so afraid of dying and would do everything in my power not to put myself in risky situations. My first thought was: I don’t want to die, so I’m not going to do that. Now, I don’t really care. Deep down I don’t want to die I don’t think, but honestly my first response to something like: Corona is so bad, hopefully no one gets it! My response is: I want it so I can die. I don’t care. And honestly I don’t know if I do care or not. It could be just a typical response since I’m a teenager and all teenagers want to die because it’s a funny thing people say.

106,"Hi,  
I suffer from some specific physical symptoms (coughing, diarrhea) and impaired cognitive function after doing some specific activities e.g. computer programming, studying specific subjects (e.g. advanced math) and hard physical activities.  
I haven't been able to put a diagnosis to this link between activities and symptoms, and thereby not been able to recover. **I hope for your help to point me in a direction to find a diagnosis or an effective recovering strategy/method.**

I started having these symptoms during my time at the university. They were intensified during my (stressful) final thesis (constant diarrhea and coughing leading to daily vomiting).  
It is now four years since I graduated. The symptoms have slightly eased, primarily because I avoid the activities that trigger the symptoms. This also means that I avoid specific activities that I used to love, which is unfulfilling.

107,"No matter what movie i watch, if theres a character who's the biggest loser in the world, in every aspect of their live, i start getting sad, cuz i relate to it. And the thing is that im not a loser. I dont know if it makes any sesne, but its how it is. Is everyone like that to an extend?

I know that it was bit of a random start but, i think its key to my mentality. I guess its because of my past experiences, which again, werent as bad, but i still got bullied. 
And recently, i came across a video, about a facial beauty and the way it influences the way people see us, and then i started thinking that it could have been the reason why i was treated the way i was.

Now, im a pretty nigga, forreal, but i developed this thing where i project my insecurities on things that you have from birth/have no control over. Again, this time it is your face shape, eye shape blah blah blah, the previous time it was something even more ridiculous like aspergers, and basically it goes on. And its not the fact that its more calming to balme things on factors that you cant change, but i dont even know. I think its just me questioning my seld if im even a worthy human, not in comparison to others, but just as a species, like, am i like other human beings? 

Now, i aint gon lie, i havent been out in a while, its not that i dont like it, but i just happen to not have any close friends at the moment. And again, i dont know if its just psychosis, from loneliness, or what but it definitely makes me a bit anxious. The thing is that when im around people i feel otherwise, i start feeling like a god, cuz Honestly, when im around others and remember that theyre nothing special, i even seperate myself from them, but ive been lonely in so long that it drives me crazy. Our break from college got elongated cuz of corona, and i hate it.

Another thing is that cuz of my past experiences as i said, i think i stopped taking myself seriously. Or i dont even know, fuck.. is it like that?? Nah its not. But if im out in public i always feel ugly. If you came up to me and asked me my opinion about myself i would say the opposite, and thats how i really think, but the fucking feeling is there. Its not that its 24/7 but it still comes and gies.

I mean, really, do pretty people even get bullied? Like i cant recall anything like that from my own experience. Does it really have that much importance? Most of the time i used to think that ugly people seemed ugly cuz they lacked charisma, but how you gon build charisma if you get bullied and leave negative first impression cuz of your looks.

108,"Hi, would like to get your opinion on how to start habituation exercise, I have a weird ocd when I gaze at thighs of other people, and I felt discomfort/guilt doing that involuntarily or urge i dunno. Im not aroused by their thighs I just randomly look at them but felt guilty/uncomfortable/felt like a perv. My typical reaction is too avoid looking or use hoodie to minimize my peripheral vision. I haven't gone to real psychologist because of work/money but I found this yt about ocd by katie d'ath which is the closes to all of my anxieties.

Backstory I was sexually assaulted at work by a client, it was a slow day of fall of 2015 a client approach me for data entry task, as I get his details  his hand went to my left pants,  was shocked when he touched my legs then escalated to my groins feeling as his hand reaching my peepee, my only reaction was shocked and I cough so hard trying to be professional so he could notice that I am violated, stupid me didn't wanna create commotion in the office just cough so hard that he stopped like ehemm in a loud manner. That day I was violated, I couldn't erased it from my mind till this day. 


I dunno if that event might have caused my ocd guilt when suddenly gazing upon my seatmates thighs, sometimes bulges for men but most of the time it just thighs. for girls I usually notice if I saw someone who had fair complexion which trigger me to have a gaze, guilt/ struck again. My response is to look away or avoid being on that seat. But in the office my seatmates (men) has taken notice of me sometimes staring at theirs thigh, most of the time, I caught attention when they were fidgeting, my response when I have ocd is to wear my hood or look other ways. I dunno they might have noticed my being uncomfortable when I gaze at them, one of my peers moved his chair away so less sight of theirs. Im not aroused by that stares and thoughts of them accusing me a being a perv is strong, I dunno I notice most men won't come near me, even girls that they noticed me gazing at their thighs.

Other details is that I'm bisexual, aroused by both girls (hentai mostly, mia khalifa type) or men mostly handsome and athletic built - muscle fetishes - started muscle fetish when I was 12 or later). Also i have low self confidence I usually look down so as to avoid eye contact with me.

Is there any hope for perv like me. Help me.

I want to get help and plan on talking with my parents, but they are currently away from home on a trip right now. 

Since they are away, I am taking care of my sister who has Down syndrome. She is the light of my life and I love her so much. I would never let anything had happen to her. I would die for her. 

However, last night I decided to enjoy two chocolate martinis. Then I had two shots. I’m not sure if I had any more because I honestly can’t remember. I fell asleep probably around 10:30 PM and when I woke up at 5:30 I found that my sister had put herself to put upstairs, and that I ate an entire large bag of chips with salsa and left it all over the kitchen. I don’t remember doing this either.

I was always in denial of having a a drinking, but when I drink I’m always the drunkest one at the party. I am quite small and while I “know my limit,” I just ignore it because I don’t care about myself at all. I almost died from alcohol poisoning 3 years ago, and I was scared of alcohol for a year after. Since I’ve been back on it I always lose control when I drink. 

If I have wine it’s never one glass. It’s the whole bottle. I also used to have a problem with marijuana. I always HAD the be high. Life wasn’t enjoyable if I wasn’t. I smoked at least once a day for almost two years. One day I woke up in November and quit cold turkey. I threw everything out. I’ve smoked twice since then, but I have no desire to so. 

I would like to quit everything. I feel I am substituting marijuana for alcohol. If alcohol is accessible to me, I lose control. 

I just feel so guilty overall. I feel like I failed myself and my sister. I feel so guilty because I would never forgive myself if something happened to her while I was passed out from being black out drunk. She is everything to me and after neglecting her last night (from being drunk), I now see I have a problem. 

Im only 20 years old so I don’t know what to do. There are alcoholics in my family. My grandfather himself was an alcoholic and was known as the drunk in my community. He drank until the day he died even though he was advised not to because of medical conditions. I want to change now before decades go by. I don’t want to neglect the ones I love.",15Mar2020,1

112,"**TLDR:** As the title says, my (22M) sister (17F) is apparently faking mental illness, as well as lying about other serious events. I'll go into more detail throughout this post, but that's the basic idea. It's creating a lot of problems and I want to know how to help her, but have no idea where to start. 

### Background

Before I get too deep into this, I should say that I'm pretty sensitive to these types of issues. I've struggled with my own mental health, had a long term relationship with someone who had severe BPD (they would maim themselves during arguments, try to bite me, etc.), and grew up with two other special needs sisters. So I'm pretty familiar with what these things look like. 

I believe that she probably has a real underlying mental illness, but the problem is that it's so buried beneath fakeness that it's hard for anyone to help her. She was recently forced to drop out of school because of these issues and has shattered her relationship with most of the adults in her life, aside from me, which is putting a lot of stress on me, especially since no one else wants to help anymore. 

### Evidence That She's Lying

I'll start with the things I'm completely sure she's lying about or that I know are true, then move onto the more vague instances. And for clarity, I'm going to call her Jane.

1. Before Jane dropped out, she was living with my Dad, stepmom, and youngest sister, in an apartment. Jane recently moved in with me after dropping out, so it's just the three of them living in that apartment now. I babysat my youngest sister a few weeks ago while they had a night out. While there, my youngest sister (elementary age) asked me questions about things Jane had been telling her. There were several lies, but the most serious was that Jane told her that our Dad used to rape our Mom in front of all of us when we were little, before this youngest one was born. I can't tell you how blatantly untrue this is, and it was kind of horrific to see my youngest sister thinking about these things.
2. At one point Jane had video evidence that our youngest sister was in an abusive situation with her mom (different from our Mom), but didn't tell anyone because the mom was buying weed for Jane. Only after Jane and the mom got in a fight did Jane release this evidence, which was months into this situation. There are other instances of Jane putting others in harm's way for her own gain, this is just the most obvious. 
3. Jane would constantly make up lies to our parents when we were growing up to get the rest of us punished, often hurting herself (scratching herself/hitting her head into things) to convince our parents that we had hurt her. When she was around six or seven she shoved a pencil into my brother's nose during an otherwise normal sibling argument. Around that same age she would sit at the desktop computer in our living room, look at images of roadkill, and then draw those images. There are lots of other cases where she was excessively violent at a young age, though nothing like this has happened since she was little. 
4. Jane used to watch a YouTuber with Tourettes syndrome and shortly after started imitating Tourettes at school (she was 15). This led to the first instance of her being removed from school, after which she immediately stopped showing signs of Tourettes. She started doing this again more recently after Billie Eilish came out with Tourettes, but has once again stopped. 
5. My aforementioned ex with BPD has large self-harm scars all over her body, anywhere she can reach herself. They are not like average self-harm scars; they are huge, wide, and very disfigured looking, and she told me that she had at points been able to see her bones because she had cut so deep. Before Jane and my ex met, Jane had never self-harmed before; just weeks after they met, Jane started to fill her arms and legs up with similarly severe scars. Again, they are uniquely bad, not like typical self-harm scars, and it's clear that her decision to start doing this was influenced (indirectly) by my ex.
6. Jane has been evaluated two or three times now for mental illness, and the results always come back inconsistent, with doctors telling us that she is trying to manipulate the results. This doesn't mean she doesn't have anything; by now it should be clear that something is wrong. But no one can properly diagnose her. 
7. I had a period of insomnia in high school that lasted a year or two, and at severe times would cause me to have very, very minor hallucinations (vague shapes in peripheral, random pops and slapping sounds, etc.; I was always aware that they weren't real). I mentioned it to Jane once, and she soon started repeating it to other people as if it had happened to her. She even asks me questions about what it's like, which I usually don't answer since it seems like she's just trying to make it more believable. 
8. I know for sure that Jane was molested when she was in elementary school, the person who did it (stepdad who is now long gone) has admitted to touching her (I went through a similar experience in a completely unrelated incident). I don't want to be too graphic, but the parts of the story that we know for sure happened are definitely not severe, just over the clothes touching. Well, she recently decided to tell me the ""full"" story, which included years of her being raped in her bedroom. Now, this is one of the points where I'm not sure what's real and what isn't. The story she told me was incredibly detailed and included things that I don't think the average person would be able to lie about. On the other hand, other aspects make no sense at all. Jane shared a bedroom and at times a bunk bed with our older sister, but claims she was raped without our older sister knowing, even though she was in the room while it happened. She also told me stories about him touching her under her clothes during certain events, events that I was in the same room for. I would've been a young teen at this point and I don't think I was so oblivious that I wouldn't notice something like this. But again, there's no way to know for sure, and I want to believe her. 
9. Jane frequently has panic attacks that always end with her needing to be picked up from work/school, and the nature of the panic attacks is always different. I'm not totally sure what a real panic attack looks like, so this could be real. But it seems overdramatic and only happens at times when it will garner the most attention (i.e., these attacks rarely happen around family, instead, it's almost exclusively around teachers, school employees, etc.). Her attacks are sometimes just her breathing heavily, other times she rocks and thrashes around making odd noises, other times she acts like a baby (I mean that literally, not in a cruel way), sometimes she says she can't remember who she is or who anyone else is, etc. Everyone who has ever been around her during these has commented afterwards (not to her) that it seems really, really fake. 
10. Jane recently told me that our Dad hit her shortly before she dropped out of school. This jumped out as being suspicious to me, as I've seen my Dad get hit by one of his exes before (the deadbeat mom). He didn't even react, he just waited for her to calm down, and then he asked her to leave and apologized to us kids. My Dad is a huge dude and is really into bodybuilding and stuff like that. He has an abrasive personality for sure, but I've never seen or heard of him hitting anyone before, and the only reason he would have to hit my sister is that she didn't do her chores or something, which makes no sense. I can't picture a huge, stocky guy like my dad slapping a teenage girl, let alone his daughter. My youngest sister said that to her knowledge this never happened. 

### The Illnesses She's Faked

I'm going to go ahead and stop there since this post is already insanely long. Right now, the mental issues Jane is claiming to have are:

* Depression
* Anxiety
* Hallucinations
* Panic attacks
* OCD (inconsistently)
* Tourettes (inconsistently)
* PTSD (from events that are always changing)

### The Current Problem

My dilemma is that I feel like for anyone to go to these lengths to convince others they have these issues (even so far as hurting themselves and affecting their life) is indicative of a serious underlying issue (I think it's most likely BPD or Munchausen). I want to help her as best I can (which is why I let her move in with me) and help her get professional help. But she's so unpredictable, manipulative, and deceptive that it's hard for anyone to help her, let alone me. I'm also planning on moving out of the country in a year, which will more or less leave her on her own. 

When she isn't being ""ill"" she is a totally normal person and one of my best friends. She's an extremely talented artist, very funny, has great taste in music, clothes, and movies. She's a great listener and is very insightful. I love her dearly, which makes this all very overwhelming. I know I can't live her life for her or solve these issues alone, but I don't want to abandon her either. I feel like I can't talk to her about this because she'll either shut me out for not believing her or just completely ignore what I say. 

If anyone has any advice or experience they can offer, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks, and sorry for writing a book, ha.",15Mar2020,1
113,"There's a three-day program my church is having that ends today and my dad begged me to go. I felt off suddenly yesterday, the second day, and he was like ""Let's go. Please. Let's go pray and see what will happen."" But honestly, that bothered me because why should I have to go to a 3-day conference with a visiting pastor just to get better? It gives me anxiety to hear that I won't get better unless I go to church and do this, this, and that. I actually started to feel better on my own yesterday but my dad just came to me now and kept asking me and then he got frustrated because I just stood there, not saying anything and he said, ""Other people are getting their breakthroughs and we're not and you're not even trying.""

For context, my father died 3 years ago.

The dream began with me as an 11-year old, standing next to my dad's chair while hes sitting. He was scolding me, talking about my mistakes, and how he was so ashamed of me. He told me that I was a horrible person, a spoiled brat, and that he was deeply ashamed. He really tore into me with his words. I was crying, and feeling my body get shaky and dizzy.

122,"I was walking toward the entrance to a supermarket in my town, where I have lived for two years. A couple, a man and woman in their young 30’s, around my age, around my height, not dressed very differently than me, strangers to me on every way, were walking out. It was windy but as we were passing the woman said to the man, “[my name here] caused this to happen.” I heard her say it very clearly. I can only assume she meant people staying home under quarantine and to avoid getting sick. I don’t know why people know my name or my face or why they want to/feel it’s ok to hurt me but I wish so badly I could understand why they do that.

Had a few drinks. 3 weeks later One in particular I talked to in the club I found out was a transgender. I never hung out with the person or anything. Forgot how the person looks like I just know their social media from doing research her pictures were super edited so I just moved on. 

3 weeks later this person calls me to meet it at the club. I was busy that night (thank god) but I started questioning a lot of things like red flags, she sounds funny on the phone.. her social media doesn’t have no old pics. Things just seemed weird. In my head I was like this might be a tranny.

Needed up finding out by typing her number in google , also confirmed she sent me and text saying she’s trans. I just blocked the number so fast.

I just feel disappointed and embarrassed I was in the club talking to a tran and didn’t even know it.

I usually be very cautions on who I talk to in the club . It was a high class club that doesn’t let everybody in so maybe it was passable idk. 
No one tapped me on the shoulder or anything that night like “hey watch out for those” maybe no one noticed I guess. Or maybe they did and just laughed.


I’m a straight male. Now I feel nervous talking in the club to chicks because I don’t want this to happen again, it be dark and loud in clubs where I’m at.

I guess the good part of the situation is I found out early and never met up with and did anything but still  It could been worse. But like I feel ashamed and embarrassed that my manhood is being tested.
I think about the situation since I found out. It happen month ago but it’s still fresh on my mind.

Just trying to move on from this situation. Should I seek a therapist or am I taking this too far?",15Mar2020,1
128,"In my case, I want to dye my hair forest green or teal after growing it out and getting it chemically straightened. Like, I just feel like my life's out of control, so I want to change my appearance to feel a sense of control. I'm also kind of digging the alternative look right now and want to emulate the ""big tiddy goth gf"" aesthetic.

Ugh, I'm such a fucking mess thinking about doing this kind of shit when I should be worried about finding a job. I feel like I'm stuck in perpetual adolescence and that I probably won't fully mature until my mid-30s. Might as well enjoy myself while I still can since I'm not getting any younger.

129,"I live my whole life. by feeling.

134,"Hi there, I am 21F from the UK and I have been suffering with some mental issues from a young age. I am wondering if there are any professionals I can talk to regarding my current issues linking with things that happened in the past which may have contributed to my current problems. I used to have seizures as a child but they stopped around the age of 14. They would only happen once a year either on the last day of March or the first of April. I have read that Epilepsy can cause multiple mental health issues however I was not diagnosed with epilepsy as every test taken came back negative. The cause of my seizures is still unknown to this day. I am asking if someone could tell me if there could be a possible link between  my seizures and my bad cognitive and behavioural issues. I still have some absent seizures today however my tonic clonic seizures are no more. I have been diagnosed with Anxiety and Depression but I have concern I may have something similar to ADD.

I know this is a complicated request so I wont be surprised if no one has a clue! Thank you :)",15Mar2020,1
135,"So I feel like I've fucked up. Like really fucked up. The kind of fucked up you can't recover from. I don't know maybe I still can, but It's hard for me to stay optimistic or positive about my life anymore. It's almost like I've made every wrong choice in my life and now I'm paying for the consequences of my actions. I deserve to feel this way honestly. I have done nothing to better my life when I still had potential. I had potential to be someone. To do something meaningful with my life. I had potential to love myself at one point, but now I feel like I'm too far gone to even consider that anymore. I had potential to find love at some point in my life, but now it seems unrealistic. I had potential to do well academically and pursue higher education and do something I love. I had potential to be happy.
 
Instead I chose the easy path.

I chose to indulge. To live in the moment rather than building towards a future where I am happy. To do nothing at all except play video games all day. To isolate myself from everyone. To not develop myself as a person. To not even try anything that wasn't already known and comfortable to me. To chase instant gratification and not develop discipline. I chose to be this way and now I'm fucked.

It feels like I've come to this realization too late and it feels like it actually is too late. Too late for me to become who I could have been. Too late for me to turn it around completely 180°. Too late for me to do the things I should have been doing years ago. Too late to ever truly be happy with my life.

I'm 19 years old and I have done literally nothing with my life. Literally nothing. 
There are fucking 12 year olds hell even 8 year olds who have done more with their lives than I have. I'm a fucking loser. I'm worthless. Why I think I'm fucked:

I'm painfully insecure. Taking any compliment I ever get and skewing it into it somehow being manipulative or a compliment out of pity or something. 

Never developed good social skills (I'm painfully awkward around new people. Don't get me started on being around people of the opposite sex.)

I dropped out of high school. (To play video games and smoke weed)

I've never had a job. (I don't even know how/where to start. Even if I did get one I know I would still feel the same as I do now.)

I've never been in a relationship. (No social skills or dating skills. Anxiety. I'm fucking oblivious to how people operate, think, act, etc.)

I've never had any real friends. (Social skills, anxiety, fear, insecurity and painful past experiences.)

I don't know if it's even possible for me to recover and do the things I want/should do.
I want to go back to school, maybe even pursue further education. I want to learn social skills and be somebody people enjoy to be around. 
I want to learn how relationships work and be in one. I want to find somebody. To find love. I don't know even know how to love and receive love though. I hate myself and I don't know if that will ever change. I just hate who I have become and wish I could change and be who I dream of being.

Even if I did somehow manage to fix any or all of this, I would probably find something else to be depressed over. Like how it took me until 19 to snap out of whatever the fuck I've been in. To realize I'm wasting my life sitting inside playing video games and smoking weed all day still living with my mother. 

I would be depressed over how much time I've wasted not actually developing myself.
I feel like I'd be playing catch up the rest of my life with things that people were doing when they were in their early teens. I'd be filled with so much regret.

I don't even know who I am.
I don't know what I like or dislike.
I don't know my values.
I don't know what I want from life.
I have no personality.
I have no opinions of my own.
I have no character.
I have no skills.
I have no hobbies.
I don't know how to love or be loved.
I have no redeeming qualities.
I'm a sheep. I'm not my own person.

141,"Firstly, I think I need to clear some things up for this to make some sense. Also, sorry if my grammar isn't the best. I am not a native English speaker.

I am pretty certain that I have some sort of eating disorder. I have never felt good about how I look, mainly my weight, and struggled with anxiety and lots of negative emotions surrounding this issue. I was (and still am) stressing over everything I eat, I count calories in every food and drink and I feel super guilty and if I am about to puke after I eat something quote on quote ""unhealthy"". I also used to exercise extensively (up to 6 times a week) and there was a time when everything I ate in a day was about half a cup of mashed potatoes (just potatoes, no milk or butter etc.) and a slice of apple. In that time I lost about 20+ kg in three months but thankfully had enough control to ""stop"" after this started to affect my day to day life (I felt weak all the time, had trouble focusing and almost fainted a few times when I was in class. apart from that I was in pain because I ate so little. this mixed with my naturally low blood pressure wasn't...very fun, to be honest). So I started eating really healthy to feel at least a little better. And thankfully, it helped.

Now I am a lot better then I was about a year ago. I still have bad days but those thankfully aren't as frequent as my good ones. I even can eat some junk food sometimes and I don't feel as horrible as before. I know this isn't a thing to be proud of but it still makes me kind of happy.

But this isn't the main thing that I wanted to write about. However, I think it's connected to my issue.   I always feel irritated/on edge. And these feelings are worst around my family, especially my mum. Every single thing pisses me off. If it's someone chewing loudly, making a weird noise, talking with their mouth full or watching me doing chores... It's tiring. I want to spend time with my family but it almost always ends up with me yelling or arguing with them. Or when I try to behave it frequently ends up with me holding back crying/panic attack because everything is super overwhelming, triggering and just awful. Or even better, I hide into my room where I proceed to punch and bite myself hard so I can focus on pain and not what is upsetting me so much.

 So I avoid these kinds of situations by...just not being there. I leave my room only if it's absolutely necessary and I almost always have headphones with music on or at least radio turned on loudly so I can be distracted from the rest of the house residents. And know that my mum suffers from it. 

My sister moved out a few years ago so I am the only child in the house. And well, my mum is a very touchy feely kind of person. She always wants to hug me and tell me how much she loves me and just wants to make my day better. But then I shout at her for whatever bullshit that annoys me at that moment and...it's just ruined. I love her so much, she is an amazing person and I only wish her the best in her life. Which definitely isn't me. I feel like such a horrible person and just thinking about this makes me want to cry as I often do so when there isn't anything to distract me from this fact.

I am a terrible child and they deserve a much better daughter than me. Both of them.",15Mar2020,1
142,And a lot of you can relate. It's easy to pretend like you don't. Maybe it's a comfort thing. Maybe it's a lot easier to pretend someone cares if they pity you. Maybe I've just lived a really crappy life feeling like people should care more,15Mar2020,1
143,"First, some background:

I was diagnosed with anxiety when i was around six years old. I wasn’t treated with medication until about three years ago since my parents were to focused on the ADHD i was also diagnosed with since it was affecting my grades

Because of this, i am able to perfectly cope with my ADHD and don’t need medication anymore. However, my anxiety is still a mess.

My anxiety led to me being diagnosed with depression, which is genetic and rose to the front when my anxiety got to be too much.

I have a lot of problems that happen, physically and mentally, in relation to my mental illnesses. 99% of the time i dismiss my problems as an overreaction, which has lead to some long-lasting problems

For example, i thought that i had never had a panic attack before. I always thought mine were too minor to be considered a panic attack. However, when i explained one of those little episodes she informed me that i do in fact have panic attacks quite often, and that i should have told her so we could nip it in the bud before it got bad.

Now i’m even more paranoid about if i’m under-reacting to my problems.

Like do i have an auditory sensitivity problem? Or is it normal to be sensitive to noises in the morning and late evening?

Do i dissociate? Or is my spacing out, memory problems, and world-warping episodes just a side effect of my ADHD?

I wish there was a way to distinguish which is which. I once hit a volleyball weirdly and hurt my thumb. I thought it was just a bruise and i needed to suck it up, but t ended up being a really bad sprain and i was out for half the season.

146,"I'm 28. I deal with my own mental health struggles as it is ( depression, anxiety, hopelessness ). However, what I am struggling with at the moment is understanding life. 

A lot of my family members are dying around me, from illness ( Cancer, old age, and otherwise ). Life is just not the same as it was when I was growing up. We don't do the same things anymore. We don't see the same people. I don't have hope and forward-looking as I once had. I feel a sense of despair.

Mom and Dad divorced when I was very young. Mom then went on to meet a very nice man who later became a Father Figure to me as my own biological Father was on and off the scene due to his own mental health problems. This new Father-Figure went on to develop cancer suddenly and died within Months, this was my first experience with death. It changed me. He was 53. I was about 14.

A few years later my Aunt, who was the life and soul of the family ( she was the artsy one, always held the family events ) developed liver cancer, again she was about 50. A year later my Mom's aunt and uncle ( my great aunt and uncle ) both died of cancer within 2 months of each other, they were mid sixties.

2 years after that I lost my biological Father due to liver failure and a multitude of other alcohol-related illnesses, he was 56. That was a weird time. I had an on/off relationship with him over the years due to his alcohol abuse and complicated family history.

A year later, I lost my wonderful Grandma. She practically helped raise me. She died suddenly, though was a fair age at 89. That one really stung.

That was about 3 years ago now and since then we have had other perhaps not so close family members pass on due to old age or otherwise.

I just seem to be surrounded by death... The family is not the same... 

Literally this evening, which is what prompted my post I guess, I heard that my Uncle went for a routine check-up and they found a tumor in his colon.

153,"So after a walk today I got back and got into an argument with my housemate. When I got back he asked me to take my shoes off in case they were muddy when I walked through to the back door to take them off. The soles were clean, which made me not think about it, but I didn't appreciate the snappy tone he had. 

Then I accidentally brushed past him and he snapped again, before I muttered something and walked off. I then went to get some laundry and needed to remove some of his stuff from the washer/dryer. I didn't feel like talking to him after his tone earlier, so I put them by the side. He then stormed through and said ""you could have asked me to move them!"" in another aggressive tone. 

I then went upstairs for a bit in a foul mood, with the voices berating me in my head and felt like utter shit. I then went down for a drink and he came out of his room heading straight towards me. I interpreted this as him deliberately trying to cut me off, but I realise it could have been him not seeing me, but I shoulder barged him out the way. I probably shouldn't have done this, but I was in a foul mood, and wasn't thinking. This led to another argument and I blew my lid, saying how he moody he was when he was blabbering about how I nudged into him and didn't say excuse me. I said how I thought the gap was big enough (which it was), but stumbled into him by accident. He said I could have apologised, I said I didn't have time since he then was moody, and I didn't feel like apologising afterwards. He said he wasn't moody and said it was me being so.

This has pissed me off and I have done something I now regret. For the first time in my life I have self harmed. Only minor, but it has shaken me. I have scratched myself with my keys and thumped the wall. My fingers hurt, but I know it's not broken as I can flex them perfectly. They just feel a bit sore. I don't know what to do now and I feel awful. I am not apologising for things I should apologise for (the shoulder barge, being thoughtless with my shoes maybe) until he makes an effort himself for how he acted himself, but I don't want there to be a schism, especially as I have another housemate who heard the argument and urged no shouting.

154,"I'm a failure in all ways perceivable. My exams are in two days and I've barely studied, I have no chance of passing. I have no friends, nor is there any point in making friends because I always manage to hurt or annoy or bother people. I'm unpleasant to be around and people avoid me on purpose. I'm fat, ugly, my voice is disgusting, I'm stupid and unable to grasp social cues, lazy and have no skill or talent whatsoever. 

I put off applying for jobs either because I'm a lazy fuck who doesn't want to work or because I feel like I won't be of any use as an employee anyway. I'm a waste of space. I literally have no redeeming qualities. If I've never been anything but a burden to people and this world in general, do I even deserve to live?",15Mar2020,1
155,"This is new for me and I've never posted before but I need people to turn to. I am a 21 year old female and I do not understand what is going on in my brain, I am not even sure If I can explain it.

1. There is constantly , never ending, music playing in my head. But it doesn't seem to be the ""oh Ive got a song stuck in my head"" kind of thing people seem to talk about, its loud and its constant and it can change with out me even really noticing it. Its so much louder than the voice in my head, so much so that I sometimes struggle to hear my own self. It also means I become over stimulated and overwhelmed by my surroundings, even just simple convocation can be impossible for me.
2. I see certain events as colours. As strange as that sounds, but in the moment, if something is happening , my brain will just suddenly throw up a colour (e.g.blue) and start repeating BLUE BLUE BLUE and this can actually enhance the moment that Im in. For example sometimes during sex its like tunnel vision and my brain will just completely ingulf itself in colour orange, or I remember being on the train and having the overwhelming feeling of YELLOW YELLOW and just my whole body understanding the colour yellow as this environment and that moment in time.
3. I cant seem to stop dislocating, especially with large groups of people. When I am on my own it doesn't seem to be as bad or I just don't notice it as much, but when with a group of people or with my boyfriend sometimes my vision and sound just goes and I just kind of leave for a few moments.
4.  I can only explain things in images. So, I struggle to explain certain things with words as they just come to my head as images. For example I have the feeling of nervousness and sadness and lonely as all I can see it as is a plate and a sponge having paint poured on them. The paint just slides straight off the plate , but the sponge absorbs all these beautiful colours. I am the plate, and I see this image often in my head and it makes me feel nervous and anxious.

Hi. I am a 25 y/o male who is really depressed rn. I haven’t been happy since I was 13. I suffer from social anxiety and ocd too. Currently I’m not on any medication for this. Before I was on Luvox and klonopin but it made me feel really slow and I just stopped it. Now I just puff on some weed but it really doesn’t help. I just want to sleep all the time. 

On the surface my life seems great. I have a family. A roof over my head, a new car, etc but idk I just don’t feel like being alive. It’s a pain waking up. I feel uncomfortable around my family now, especially my dad. Idk what to do. I just needed to let this off my chest. Any advice would be helpful.",15Mar2020,1

I don't know how to handle this. Over the years, I've found my ways to deal with stress, anxiety and depression, but now I've developed a new thing, where rejection, brash comments and hurdles in personal projects really hurt me hard.

162,"I guess I’ve never been happy. Or well ever fully living in this reality. I don’t really saying what I have is ‘trauma’ but it’s what others would say. 

Ever since I was little I’ve just come up with ways to help things seems better, back then it was just dolls and toys. 

It just got worst as I grew up.

I’m not the smartest student, I’m not the best child and I’m overall not the best person. I’ve never been happy with what I do. My only form of happiness and what’s kept me sane is like.. headcanons for other characters.

I find my self attaching myself to tv characters who I share similar things with. Both appearance and personality wise. This characters usually stick with me for a while, and I super focus on the show or movie their from. 

But suddenly nothing feels like it’s working. I feel so disconnected.

To cope I’ve managed to convince my self that the simulation theory is real. The theory that nothing is real. 

I’ve convinced my self I am the only being alive and everything around me is scripted code and everything is planned. 

But I don’t want to be apart of this anymore. This can’t be real life. I want to wake up.

I want to wake up so bad, I wanna see what the real world is like.

Our universe is built of trust. Why do we call the colour red ‘red’. Because we trust the person who told us it was called ‘red’.

We trust things to create a view point. But there’s so many different options you can chose to trust- and I don’t like it.

It’s a nice way of thinking I guess. I don’t need to worry, because there’s no point.

But at the same time, it feels like I’m driving my self insane trying to wake up. 

I’m sorry for this, it’s mainly me rambling about how I just feel like a misplaced code, feel free to ignore.

TLDR; I feel like I’m going insane after (what feels like I have) convinced my self life isn’t real and I’m trying to wake up.",15Mar2020,2

172,"Last night I was awake until morning shaking with a fever of 101 and sweating and my throat got worse and I have kept telling my parents on the phone they need to fucking self quarantine already because clearly they are at risk of having it and since I live by myself and don’t even interact with any other humans or leave the house (no job/school) except once a week when they come visit to go grocery shopping I only could have gotten it from them. Someone from my dad’s work was exposed and they have been feeling a little under the weather. But they haven’t been listening to me, they have just been going out grocery shopping and working

I have always been weak, I would get seizures from the common cold well into my teenage years and that’s actually a whole problem in that I still don’t know if this is just a cold because I always get awful symptoms and fever. But they still came to visit me after being exposed and now I’m sick. I called my mom last night scared because my head was so heavy and heart was pounding, and I have been drenching the bed with sweat, and she got mad at me for calling because she was tired and wanted to go back to bed. I felt awful and like I am a fucking idiot overreacting

They are part of the problem with this entire country and why this is such an issue, why people like Donald trump are president, they keep saying well I feel better or fine or I’m not that sick, my dad even said he’s a hero and an “Emergency Coronavirus worker” for continuing to go to work and “bringing food to the hungry children” (he is a food delivery truck driver) I said he’s literally fucking probably spreading it to tons of people shut the fuck up, they keep saying they don’t have room to care about the country they aren’t the mayor they have their own problems so they have to take care of themselves. Then my dad said I’m not going to be able to get disability because I don’t “look or sound that retarded” and I need to go get a job like he does (I had to drop out of my dream college that I got a $72,000 scholarship to go to,  I couldn’t do it because of schizophrenia and autism.) and my mom said she lost her job at Amazon because of me and how I got hospitalized. Well I didn’t fucking tell her she had to quit, I didn’t need or want her, she quit because she said the job was too hard

They keep saying I’m overreacting and “people are laughing about it and going to Vegas and bars right now explain that!!!There’s barely any cases we’ll be fine!! I’m just sick from allergies and working so hard!!!” When I called my mom last night because I was feeling really bad she got mad at me and said was tired and needed to sleep and even said my symptoms were probably just from accidentally overdosing on ibuprofen (that I was taking in the first place for my fever..... And didn’t even take the max dose)

I’m going to go get tested so that way if I’m positive they’ll be forced to stay home. To be honest I’m terrified though considering there’s only 32 “confirmed” cases in Oregon and I’m so afraid the trump administration will send more people out to stalk me. I will be turning myself into more a political target. I’m already a target by them and now they’re really going to have reason to come for me all because of my parents. But If I don’t do anything they could convict me, they will do whatever they can to spin things like that. I have been being gang stalked by this organization, that’s a subset of the group in Russia who got trump elected for months and there is no way they won’t up stalking even more if I test positive. To be honest thinking about that I don’t know what to do I want to die the stalking is so bad already. I think you won’t believe me but I can prove this is happening. It is so bad I am starting to consider if this could be the end for me, where I would reach a point where I just have to kill myself because of this group. Even if I test negative they will spin it some way, just for me going to see a doctor. They have been searching for something to convict me for, even if they have to lie or take video or audio footage out of context to make me look like I have committed some crime.

I think about suicide, I've written notes and I think about how I might do it. 

All of my opinions on things are just neutral. It's like I dont love or like anything. This can spread from music, to shows, to even my family and friends.
Theres nothing I love, everything is sort of just there in my life, and I assume things will just be filtered out until the next batch of things in my life come in and I just find them neutral as well.

I'm not a fan of any sort of sexual stuff. The only reason I want to have sex is so I dont feel like I'm falling behind or different from others.

187,"Trigger warning:
- suicidal thoughts
- self harm
- eating disorders

This is very long but please bare with me. Please help me help myself. I am 27F. 

To start with, I think my main problem is that I don’t feel like I have a right to say I have a problem. I am terrified that all these years of inner torture are actually all just bullshit. I feel as though, although I might feel anxious and depressed sometimes, and although I’ve self harmed in the past and fantasised about suicide, what if I’m actually just full of shit and I make this stuff up because I don’t have the back bone to actually face my problems and instead id prefer to be diagnosed with some mental illness that takes away some of the responsibility I’ve probably just been avoiding all along? 

This fear has stopped me seeking help in the past many times. This starts a cycle that sort of sounds like this: 
“I don’t have a problem, I just don’t want to be held accountable for my actions and I use the possibility of being mentally unstable to justify why I say and do shitty things sometimes.”
Then, this turns into a self pity party where I cry, yell, sometimes I break things, sometimes will have a full blown anxiety attack at the realisation this might be the truth. 
THEN this turns into a desperation, and I start frantically thinking HEY hang on these are total symptoms of a real mental illness, I should see a doctor. 
I book a doctors appointment and I go, knowing in the back of my mind I’m probably full of shit. I tell the doctor about my anxiety, fear, extremely low self worth and they put me on a medication and send me to a therapist. 
I take the meds and see the therapist (for a little while) and then I just decide one day that, because they don’t seem to be treating my issues with any urgency or I don’t feel like they really care, I start to read into their body language and conclude they would rather be dealing with someone with real issues and someone who really needs the help - not someone with just a fucking inferiority complex. 
I proceed to cancel all my appointments and stop the medication immediately and say “fuck it, none of this is actually real, I don’t actually even need to be here because I’m full of shit.”

Then I’ll push the experience out of my mind. Then I go to hang out with friends/go into public/get out more, and I start to compare myself to every single person around me and wonder why i can’t be more this, that, more like other people. Then I’ll have ONE tiny encounter with one person who doesn’t take my or my self esteem seriously, and that’s it. It would only take something so little for someone to say or look at me differently, but it hits a nerve when it does. They have ‘crossed a line’ and I will ‘make them pay’, usually I decide the best way is to kill myself out of spite to make them feel bad.

Then I start to plan out how I would do it, who will look after the cat, who will care? Would my family be okay if I did? Then I realise I’m a coward and would never have the guts to kill myself, and that none of this is real or legitimate and that I’m once again, full of absolute shit. - although if I don’t decide I want to kill myself out of spite for the other person, I decide that I need to go out of my way to make their life difficult as pay back, which I have never followed through with either. As soon as they say something nice again I’ll reconsider everything I thought before and change my mind again and they’re not so bad.

Then I realise, yet again, that these are the thoughts of someone who’s possibly mentally unstable. And so I book ANOTHER doctors appointment, and the cycle. fucking. starts. again. This has happened 4 times now with 4 different doctors and 4 different therapists, but the 5th time I tried my doctor didn’t even follow up with the referral which reinforced my belief that she too, thinks I’m full of shit.

Obviously a lot has happened outside of this too. I’ve seen one good therapist but I didn’t feel it got deep enough. She helped me figure out that I have an “a-typical eating disorder”. I was supposed to get help for this but alas, I decided that was all bullshit, it wasn’t real and I didn’t actually need help.

Objectively, I have been trying for years (because my doctors don’t or won’t) to diagnose myself (pffff, I know) with something so that I can get help that helps. I’ve been told I have anxiety and depression when I was a teen but I feel as though I possibly have symptoms of borderline personality disorder. A close friend of mine has this and she has helped me learn a lot more about it. I am terrified to go to the doctor to ask them to figure out if this could be the problem, and if not, then what the fuck IS my problem, do I even have a problem? Because it starts a new cycle all over again and I’m just not sure I can take that anymore. However, I am too scared to actually commit suicide and part of me wants to come out the other side of this toxic mindset. I feel completely and helplessly trapped in my own head. Please, somebody help me.",15Mar2020,1
188,"My(17m) friend’s(17f) really close friend recently killed himself and she hasn’t been the same since. She just seems kinda out of it and she’s been drinking more. I tried reaching out last night and said I would be there for her and she accepted my help, but I don’t expect her to reach out bc of our history. I liked her a few times and even asked her out on a few dates. She rejected me and even stood me up on one occasion. I’m still concerned for her and really want to help her. What should I do?",15Mar2020,1
