1,"I've had these symptoms forever, but I never really thought too much about it until my partner became an artist. 
When I look at colors, they change and fade. For example, I was looking at a pimple and I was for sure that it was green. However my fiance looked at it, assured me it was white, and when I looked again, it was white. 
Another example, I was sure that an outfit I love was pink. Again, my fiance and his friends assured me it was purple. I stared at it for a good five minutes, and then I was that it was purple.
This also happens if I look at a wide array of colors. I play this color fading game, where you try to arrange the colors from one hue to another. I'll be going along fine in it, then I look back and realize I've mixed up all of the colors. Like if it was supposed to go from purple to green, I'll have green on the purple side and purple on the green side. 
Not a huge issue, but it kinda of weirds me out. Why cant I keep track of colors?",21Sep2020,1
2,I've been struggling with symptoms from all of these and they never really connect. I'm not confortable sharing all the things I've went through because I feel anxious to talk about them publicaly like this.,21Sep2020,1

4,"I haven't been to therapy in a quite a while, since I was out of work, between jobs, or working partial hours for a long time, due to the very reason I need therapy. I now have a full time with healthcare provided as well as a new apartment and the added stress is making it impossible to avoid treatment. I'm especially concerned that I'll lose my job because I have very poor executive functioning. For the same reason, I'm concerned about being able to manage my time and money spent looking for a therapist. Since I don't want to diagnose myself here, I'll just explain that I have some moderate/severe social anxiety, so I have trouble making phone calls and being too agreeable. I also have a tendency to hyperfocus or obsess, and difficulty with organization, prioritization, and impulse control.",21Sep2020,1
5,"Sometimes I'll think I'm doing really well. I'll be having a good, productive day. And then all of a sudden, it's like I run into this invisible brick wall and I'm just sad. There's no apparent cause, I'm just really sad. My depression runs me over like a truck and it's really hard to shake off for the rest of the day. Not sure if this happens to anyone else.",21Sep2020,1
6,"I have been having an issue for the past 2 years about where I feel an insane need to have to check to be sure I did things like turned off sinks or closed and locked doors. My main problem occurs every night. I walk around my bathroom for about 10 minutes making sure I turned off my two sinks and my shower. I check each sink faucet multiple times and I know that they are off every night but it’s like if I don’t check I can’t live with myself. I repeatedly push on the sink handles and run my hands under the faucet. I check each sink about 50 times before I finally go to bed. I don’t want to spend all this time in the bathroom, but I just can’t help it. Another problem I have is when I am closing doors. After leaving my house, I tend to turn around and make sure I closed and locked all the doors before leaving the neighborhood. I know I did these things but I can’t help it. The issue is very serious to me and I need help. Any advice with what’s wrong with me is helpful, thank you.",21Sep2020,1

9,"My husband is in the military and we have gone through some very tough situations in our marriage. For privacy’s sake I’m going to keep details to a minimum because the things we’ve been through and our specific situation is very unique and recognizable to those who may know us. For four years we had a long distance relationship while I finished my undergrad. I graduated in May of this year, ready to move across the country and finally start my life with him. He was supposed to PCS (move) to a new location closer to our home on the west coast three days before the military enacted a travel ban due to COVID. This changed his orders, sending him to a new, horrible place in the middle of nowhere with no job opportunities. On top of this, none of the rental properties would let us have our pets so we had to move 30 minutes outside of town in the middle of even more of a literal ‘nowhere’. My husband has been through a lot in his life and I think all of it finally came to a head. 

He had a breakdown and had to be admitted. The military sent him 8 hours away to a place where I cannot visit. I am now in a new town without any job opportunities. I lost the potential job I had set up on the West Coast due to the travel ban changing his orders. I graduated at the top of my class and while I know this is temporary, it’s hard for me to see any point in why I tried so hard in school the past four years. I have Aspergers and I don’t know anybody on this side of the US well enough to try and make friends. I have our animals with me and I’ve just been hanging out with them in our apartment. I’ve stopped eating and I can’t sleep at night. 

He calls occasionally and I have to keep it together because I know he needs me to be strong for him. He’ll be in there for 6 more weeks and I don’t know if I can handle this. I feel like both of us were spiraling out of control and he’s just the one that snapped first. Now nobody is here with me and I feel like I have snapped. He FaceTimed me today and I broke down crying. I feel so bad because I know that my outburst probably worried him or made him think I wasn’t thinking about him. He’s *all* I am thinking about and it hurts to be alone at such a strange and pivotal moment in my life. I don’t know what to do.",21Sep2020,1
10,"It's just another covid post, sorry. I live in a different country than my family. All their visits have of course been cancelled. I had some friends here but they all moved away last year. My cat died a couple months ago. I'm not going to be able to travel to my best friend's wedding. My job has always been working from home, independent contract work. So no coworkers. I haven't spoken to anyone in person but my spouse for about 7 months. 

I've been really weepy and lazy recently. I've gained at least 15 pounds. Every little thing annoys me. We got a new kitten but I just can't seem to bond with it. Should I just chalk this up to covid loneliness or is there something I can actually do? 

Thanks, sorry it's long.",21Sep2020,1

13,"Yesterday I wanted to kill myself, and the feeling hasn’t gone away. This has been building for a while, but I am so lost in my own life, I have no purpose, I feel alone and isolated and I wish I had more freedom for myself. I wake up and I feel miserable. I try to entertain myself with games or days out and I feel miserable. I have lost any passion for anything.

I try to talk to my friends and I hear things such as “get a grip”, “you have nothing to stress about, you are literally only 18.” I feel as though they don’t understand. I don’t rly know if anybody does, hence I crawl to reddit in the hope some stranger out there gives a shit about me. I want to kill myself still, and yet I don’t have the courage to go through with it.

What the fuck is even the point of going on? Can anyone share their experience from feeling similarly, and if so how did it go? I can’t be arsed feeling like this every fucking day, I just can’t fucking go on.",21Sep2020,1

15,Recently I’ve notice when I’m around my best friend I’ll get like random issues come out of nowhere or I’ll get them after she says that she has them. Like I’ll start to feel tired randomly then she will say she wants to go home and take a nap because she’s tired. My stomach randomly started to feel upset and I got a migraine out of nowhere today as well and when we were out she said she felt like she had to throw up then got a headache. Is there such thing as empathy symptoms or like randomly getting the same ailments as someone else you’re close to?,21Sep2020,1
16,"I took some psilocybin mushrooms to escape reality every 2-3 days for a couple months and am starting to see that I'm mentally unstable.
Been a bit over a month since I had my last trip that helped me realize that my brains not quite right.
I had a vivid image come to me a couple days ago during a bit of a mental breakdown.
It was of my mother and sister in tears kneeling on the floor in our living room(I was about 12 or 13 years old, now 28). This is a couple years after my parents seperated and we are told my dad is now imprisoned in peru (addiction-&gt;cocaine-&gt;smuggling) which devastated them. I believe this is the moment that I shut down mentally and stopped dealing with emotions. I think it messed me up more mentally than it did to them. Been a very happy individual all these years(I think...) until recently now I'm consumed by heart palpitations, light headedness, unable to focus, and random periods throughout the day where I just break down mentally and cry.

Looking into therapy now which was proving difficult. I spent a fair bit of time searching online for therapists in my area and could not find a single one. 
Told my wife this and she pulled her phone out and in seconds had a long list of therapists. Now I'm curious exactly how often my mind is putting up blockades for me...

So... any thoughts?",21Sep2020,1

19,"Hey y’all, hope you’re all doing well. I’ve been on 20mg prozac for a couple years now and a couple weeks back I felt my intrusive thoughts and anxiety skyrocket to the point where I sat in bed shaking for most of the day.

About 2 weeks ago my psychiatrist upped my prozac dosage to 40mg from 20mg. The first 7 days went very well then it felt like there was a reset on my anxiety levels and panic. My psychiatrist told me it would take 10 days but then she changed her answer to 3 weeks so I'm not too sure what to believe.

My family has always been too close to each other and always walking lines but never crossing them. My grandmother is especially unnerving and all my life has always had to have her hands on me or be near me or just stares at me and when I grew older I was able to stop spending so much time around her until four years ago when my grandfather died and my mother felt obligated to take care of her every beck and call and be around her almost every waking moment. Thankfully, with the pandemic we have just been dropping off meals and not spending any time with her. My birthday was a few days ago and she sent my dad back home with a gift for me which turned out to be 6 journals front to back detailing every minute of interaction she had with me from 1999- 2009. I'm very upset and I don't even know how to feel but my parents keep telling me it's not a big deal and I just need to let it go.

29," I accidentally cut a kids ear off with the corner of a brick pillar/wall when I was in 7th grade for the second time. I did mean to go over there and talk to the guy, I had every intention of turning him around and trying to talk with him for messing with my then girlfriend while we were in a rough patch. But not for his ear to fall off 

  That bitch played the shit out of me. Fooled around, cheated a bunch, made me look even dumber than I'd already looked. I had grown up being bullied and she only further degraded me. Anyway, all I wanted to do was talk to this kid. I wanted to turn him around so that I could kinda do that whole, ""you're walking and talking with my girlfriend and we both know it's more than just a friendly chat"" type thing.

  Hell, I was in the middle of a conversation with one of my teachers as they walked right by me. It was the end of the day, last bell had just rang, I knew I wasn't gonna let them walk right through as if she didn't notice me. I wasn't gonna wait until we got home and have her ignore me and or lie as she always did over the phone/texts/notes/to my face. And I wasn't going to wait until the next day, I had to do something now. 

  The way she came down the stairs, with him. The way her and that kid were laughing as she looked over at me with her arm wrapped around his, pressing onto his chest with her other hand. How she flicked her hair over her fuckin shoulder like popular kids and attention whores do all the time. Ya know, the typical ""cool kid table"" sorta people. Disgusting. I remember seeing my teachers mouth moving in my peripheral but I couldn't hear a sound.

  Everything was slowed down like in that one movie, fuck man what's it called.... Dredd? Now, I didn't see that movie until after this incident due to the fact the movie hadn't even come out till a few years later but that's beside the point. In this moment I'd entirely forgotten I was mid conversation with my teacher. I just started walking toward my then girlfriend and this guy. Again, I had every intention to turn the kid around and talk with him, ask a few questions, call them out, whatever.

  What I should have realized is that although I had this intention and I was conscious enough to think about it; I hadn't really grasped how quickly I was loosing grasp on reality as I'd previously explained above. If that makes any sort of sense through all the irony? It was the weirdest fuckin thing, I don't know how else to explain it really. 

  They've both made it passed me by this point but I'm clossing in. It's really loud now, kids are fuckin everywhere but it's like all these other kids are ghosts. My eyes were glued to these two. My girlfriend and this guy. The pushing and shoving of the other students, the obstacles/structures they didn't matter. I had this weird, speedy, stalk walk thing going on, I was moving like an animal. It was this surreal, dream-like feeling of absolute flow I'd never experienced before. Like some sort of prehistoric or ancient primal instinct took over where I no longer knew what I was doing, where I was going or who I was but IT did. Whatever it was. 

  I was there now. I was right behind this guy, his arm was around her waste. My feet were in sync with his. My shoulders swayed to the exact rythem, I reached my hand out towards him to turn him around. All I did was touched the fabric of the strap on his backpack. 

  Everything stopped, it was silence without a ringing in your ears, a chill without goosebumps and a heat without warmth. I have light colored eyes and the sun regularly blinds me to tears making it hard to open them without blinking like, you may see while somebody has a seizure. The brightness of this was brighter than the sunniest day with the lightest and whitest shaded piece of paper and not a cloud in the sky. If you don't understand the paper reference than you should start appreciating your brown eyes more. 

  I thought I'd killed this kid. I can't say what exactly transpired during that very brief amount of seconds my hand or hands made contact with this poor kid. All I know is that when I came to, snapped back, ""awoke"" whatever...he was on the ground staring into nothingness. His blood had even managed to *spatter* the wall of this brick pillar/column thing where the side of his head magically aligned perfectly with the very corner of this thing. Blood was pooling around his head and I notice that his ear was basically cut in half. Not hotdog style but, hamburger style. Right across the middle, straight across his ear-hole, I guess you could say? Horizontal...thats the word. 

  Turns out, I didn't kill him. Right-o, that's a huge fuckin plus in my book. Only now that he's flailing around all over the got'amn place and screaming and crying and holding whats left of his ear, I start to have the, ""Oops, I fucked up"" (with the really long drawn out, ""Man"" moment.) Ya know what I'm saying? Like, ""Maaannnnn"". So I pick my head up because this last 6-8 seconds has felt like eternity and when I do, it's all eyes on me. Did I mention that this happened in the main courtyard?

  What do I do? I make it even worse. Instead of trying to explain that it was an accident and that I'm not entirely sure what exactly just happened, I run. Like a fuckin coward. The crazy primal instinct beast thing I had slipped into was gone and now I'm running like a scared 12 or 13 year old kid, freaking the shits out of myself cause I mean, c'mon. What did I just do? It all happened so fast that as I sprinted through the court yard and passed the school admins they still hadn't realized anything even happened. I was yelled at to, ""Slow down!"" But I was expecting something along the lines of, ""Stop in the name of the law!"" Hell, I didn't even get the old school ""Freeze!""

  I get to my bus. Yes, I made it all the way onto my bus when even more panic sets in. The logic start clicking and things start making sense again. Eh, sorta. I realize that by this point they're not going to let the busses leave, I see all the admins and shit, the schools cop, ect ect outside the window looking for me. I mean, they're looking for somebody and they have an idea, the entire school is my witnesses, but it's still so fresh and they're not sure of anything anymore than I am, myself.

  I walk off the bus to make things right and I walk straight up to the officer who kinda pushes me out of the way cause ya know, they're looking for me... So I'm trying to tell the cop and the admin that I did it but they keep fuckin moving. My adrenaline is gone now and I'm starting to crash so I'm just following them through this sea of children while they look for me high and low as I'm steady walking with them saying ""hello, it was me, I did it, hey you found me, I'm your guy."" Finally by the grace of whatever you believe in, the cop turns around and asks if I saw anything. ""Yes ma'am, I did it."" Now she's asking me stuff like what'd I see, do I know where he went, and all these stupid fuckin questions. *face palm* ""MA'AM I DID IT.!""

  Needless to say, I turn around, cop puts me in cuffs like she's some fuckin hero that found a bad guy all by herself without any help cause I didn't just chase her around the fuckin school saying here I am for the past 10 minutes. It's whatever. I go to the front office. All the important people are there, the principal is the same principal I've had my whole life and he knows my parents well, and let's just say they aren't fond of one another. They get called out if work, yadda yadda yadda.

  We're waiting for my parents now, and the whole time I'm getting yelled at by this cop, all the administration dicks and I'm still pretty freaked out. I don't know what to say, so I plead the 5th basically, I just didn't say that. Next thing you know, the school is swarming with city cops, fire engine, an ambulance. You'd have thought it was a school shooting or something crazy. Then the teacher I was talking to right before it happened walks into the room and she's crying. She's a friend of my parents and I always loved her like a second mom.

  She asks me what happened. Why I did that and how it made no sense and even she was trying to explain that it wasn't like I planned it but that it was kinda just a freak thing. A snap or something. They don't care to hear that though. I'm crying now too because yes, I did feel bad. I still do to this day. I didn't even know the kids name until after his ear fell off. My parents finally arrive, my dad comes running in cause he hears them yelling at me, so he practically shoves the door open and starts yelling back at the police and the principal and everybody else, my mothers crying too. Find out the kids dad is being, ""restrained"" in another building cause he wants to beat my ass for cutting his sons ear off but apparently he stopped as soon as my dad showed up and he could hear my dad going off. So kid's dad decided to leave and be with his son instead. 

  I was facing time, had to pay all the medical bills, (it wasn't some easy, stitch the ear back on either.) Nope, too easy. Apparently they had to do some sort of plastic reconstruction surgery stuff to put it back on. Had to write a letter of apology to the kid and the family and to the father. (All separate letters for some reason) went to court and the CCTV footage had a bad angle. It showed me talking to a teacher, casually walking away, I dissappear behind the pillar thing, a few seconds go by, and then it showed me speed walking out the otherside of the pillar. They couldn't prove any malice intent. Was jotted off as an accident. Which, I feel it was, personally.

  To this day I still hear about it, people bring it up. I've heard a million different versions of what happened. What they saw. Some say he deserved it. Others say it was too fast and all they really saw was me turn this kid around and he was on the ground. Some say I shoved/slung his head into the wall when I turned him around by the back pack. Others just remember rounding the corner and seeing me stand over him with a thousand yard stare. 

  I learned a lot from that experience. I also still don't know what it was. For years I've been dealing with mental illnesses and have refused to seek help. Up until recently that is, I have my first appointment with some shrinks next week for counseling, a psychiatrist and whatever the other psycho therapy analysis person is. 

If you're reading this, I apologize again. You didn't deserve that. I remember thinking about how I probably just ruined your Halloween as it was October 30th. Probably fucked you out of enjoying a party, or a costume/mask. But hey, if it's of any consolation, I fucked my Halloween up too.

(I've previously posted this to a separate reddit but since then, have seen a therapist and have an appointment with a psychiatrist on tuesday.) 

This was more or less a story about something that took place years ago. I've only gotten worse though. It went from depression to anxiety, to panic disorder, and now agoraphobia. Ontop of it all, I may also have a personality disorder as well. I'm not suicidal but I'd like to die at times. Ya know...when things get bad.

I know he has such a difficult time telling me this since it took him so long so I wouldn't consider it toxic, just how he is and I cant change that. But it puts alot of stress on me because I have HEAVY commitment issues and often get unattached to someone a month after dating them, it's been almost 3 months now, our 3rd time dating. I've tried telling him about what I feel but i feel like it can never compare to his mental state and he wiuldnt be able to understand my emotion. I have heavy mood swings and I never tell him because his state of mind is that is stupid to feel strong emotion if it doesnt affect you in the long run, it's a waste of time. I have been losing friends recently and so now hes the only person i talk to and i cant tell him how I'm feeling and it's really really hard because I've become a custom to telling people to release my anger. now I've realized I've started taking it out on other things like my laptop and my desk and doing in healthy things I've took YEARS to stop doing. it's difficult and idk what to do because he wouldnt understand what I'm going through because he doesnt un understand emotion that well. help??

34,"I (27/F) live in the US. Things are bad. Climate change is taking its toll, our political system is a mess and is sliding into an authoritarian regime, my city just got hit with a devastating storm and we are now a COVID hot spot. Racial and socioeconomic tensions are at an all time high (in my lifetime). Everyone keeps saying 2020 is so bad, but i think this might just be the beginning of a stretch of really shitty years. Maybe the rest of my life if nothing is done to combat habitat loss and climate change. 

The thing is, in my personal life everything is stable. My husband and i live comfortably, kept our jobs, have two beautiful cats and a dog and a nice little home. I don’t want to feel this depressed and anxious about things outside my control but it feels like i can’t help it. I want to enjoy my life but it doesn’t seem possible when the world is burning.

35,"I've had a relatively positive experience with mental health throughout my life, but in the past year or so it seems that I've gotten increasingly anxious. I've somehow developed a pretty strong health-related anxiety, so bad that I've made appointments to see a cardiologist to check my heart and a dermatologist to check my skin (I'm 23 and healthy, but I can't stop obsessing over these things).

I moved to a new city a month ago and went from basically just hanging out all summer to working 5x a week and doing work for my graduate program.

36,"uuhhhhh I (21f) recently started my first job in an attempt to ground myself, learn how to interact with people again. It’s going well so far but I still feel so disconnected from this reality (and can’t make eye contact to save my life) I’m surround by family whom I love very much and love me but I feel lonely. (This is probably due to my only friend being quite literally on the other side of the country from me) I had a pretty nasty relationship 3 years back and it feels like I’m still having to pick the pieces up mentally. we were friends for a long while before we ever dated so he was already in my psyche (he was narcissist, quite possible a psychopath too) it was after our breakup that I felt i lost a piece of myself and the disconnect began. I feel so stuck in my head. My insides are always clenched up with nerves I put too much pressure on myself and I generally just don’t know what to do to help myself or where to begin. I haven’t been working very long so I’ll give it some more time but I told myself the same thing when I went to college and it never got better and I wasted 2 years and $60k. I feel like I’ve wasted so much time and I’m not doing enough. I’m petrified to drive which just adds to the soul crushing complacency I feel trapped in. I don’t know how to get out of my head. I also feel dumb for still feeling so distraught and going back to that dreaded relationship for why I feel the way I do - after 3 years you’d think something would be better.

37,"I need some advice or an opinion on what is going wrong in my head. It’s really difficult to explain but I’m going to try my best.
Basically, I get dejavu a lot at work at home hanging with friends but it’s not normal dejavu. I feel as if I’m getting dejavu and recalling the events happening from a dream instead of me actually doing said thing before, which is typical of normal dejavu. 
For example I will be at work at a new job site and I’ll get dejavu but not because I’ve been to the job site before, but because I feel like I’ve dreamed being there. This wouldn’t really bother me so much if every time I got it I didn’t have the immense feeling that all these events are leading up to something bad about to happen in my life.

38,"I’ve lately been having extreme anxiety and paranoia that turns into these full blown panic attacks that take an eternity to go away. I’ve had a number of hardships due to the pandemic and I have been handling it okay for the most part until recently. I was drinking really heavily for a while but have now eliminated it almost entirely. Lately I cannot stop spacing out and daydreaming almost all day long. All weekend I had this feeling of impending doom, and have been flighty on and off. It got so bad today that I kept thinking I was losing my mind and going insane. At the store I kept freaking out if someone got too close to me and was getting spooked by the weirdest things. I then got home became dizzy, and very lightheaded. Then my mind had racing thoughts and I felt like once again I was insane. My heart was pounding, hands shaking, and I began hyperventilating. I had to keep drinking ice water to snap back into reality and it was awful. When this happened I felt like nothing was real and that I am not really here(if that makes any sense.) I took a Xanax and it took about an hour to chill me out. I cried and have never felt so scared in my entire life. The thing that sucks the most is that there is no specific thing that triggered it. I am finally okay now, but I just don’t feel like myself anymore and I want to feel normal again. Can anyone relate or give me advice? I am going to try and find a therapist tomorrow. I had a bad reaction to SSRI’s in the past and don’t want to go down that route. I take Xanax only ever in emergency instances like this one today. Anyways, thanks for listening.",21Sep2020,1

I have struggled with headaches for over a year and I take amitriptyline for it. It has worked for a while but lately it has gotten worse. I talked to my doctor and she said to switch from 25mg to 75mg a day and I still have head aches. I also have episodes where I get very dizzy. Sometimes I am dizzy nonstop for weeks-months. I also have episodes where my vision goes black or blurry and sometimes I lost control of my body and fall. I have hurt my self from this a few times. This has been happening to me for over a year and nobody can find out why. Could these be physical symptoms of a mental illness? I have felt very sad, isolated, and overall down for a long time.

I don't even feel like doing my weekly video chat calls to my family who are back in my home country. I can see what I am doing, I can see what is wrong in my head, and why I am doing it as I have history of anxiety/depression (like nearly everyone in this world, it doesn't make me any different).

Any time I’m at a friends house or out alone, I just feel... better... I guess? I don’t know how to explain it exactly, but all I know is that being with my family causes me to feel sort of empty in a way. Don’t get me wrong, I love them with all my heart, but I can’t suppress this feeling I have. In fact, the only reason I try in school is so I can hopefully get a scholarship and move away (we’re relatively poor, so that’s my only chance of leaving).

Maybe it’s because my family was pretty conservative or because they’re not from this country, but I have literally no other explanation as to why I feel so out of place with them. Is this psychological? Was I born this way? What can explain this??",21Sep2020,1

I talked to my therapist about it and she basically was just like ""hmm wow that sucks"" so like :/ shes not a ton of help. but i was venting abt it on my instagram and my friend said ""its because you realize nothing you experience in real life will live up to your imagination."" and. holy hell hes right.

2 years ago I was living in my car due to an severely abusive bf that forced me to drop out of college after working hard for the first time in academics with a perfect GPA. We worked and went to school together. My boss knew, demoted me while giving him a promotion. My family disowned me and I lost my opportunity to intern abroad. I was so sure I'd die that year. Any free minute I had was smoking weed, drinking or on xanax. Eventually I tried to jump of the rooftop of my college and lucky a guy came out of no where and grabbed me by my backpack loop. A month later my younger brother(who was a fucking prodigy and my only real friend) completed suicide a week after I saw him. 

A month later I turned my life around and happy to say today I'm in a healthy loving relationship with two amazing dogs I found. I still struggle with bipolar depression and PTSD but am in a much better situation than before. A few months ago I was down because I was furloughed and started watching old animes for the first time in over a decade. I remembered one of my dreams since I was a child was to work and live in Japan. I started making my design portfolio and applied to jobs. Fast forward couple months now, I just got a call back finally about a company interested on hiring me if I can move by the end of the year. I'm crying so much rn. It's such a mix of happiness and feeling like I hate myself. Idk how to really handle this since I've always been the failure in my family. I did this for my brother and me. I feel like, for once, I'm so greatful that stranger saved me from jumping. I feel so unworthy because my brother would of made a better impact in the world if I killed myself before him and maybe he would be inspired to finish his dreams. Man, I hate myself.

55,"Hello everyone, 21 F here. There is a TLDR at the bottom.

I am in the middle of a Teams call while writing this and my sudden realization kicks in and I notice how I am bitter, envy and sad(?) about many things. As the people in the call are all chirpy and happy, I just feel like a grumpy uncle at family dinner. I roll my eyes and feel annoyed most of the time.

I'm not sure if it stems from my upbringing due to comparison between my siblings, cousins or peers but nowadays, I feel as though that I envy and feel bitter about other people's success. These people could be my friends that I am close with. I know I should be happy for their successes but  I just feel so bitter and envious.

I think it all kinda started when I was 12 maybe even earlier? There was a girl who I was best friends with but she had always been better than me, physically and academically. I guess I *was* happy for her successes but as the years go by, she progressed and I keep feeling as though I've regressed. To this day, I still feel very envious of her life and her achievements. It's like I want to be her but I know I will never be like her.

I keep telling myself that I run my own race and I shouldn't beat myself thinking about it. I should be proud of my own achievements. I mean, I am proud but there's always a tinge of bitterness, disappointment and envy feeling when I realize I didn't do enough. Some days I just feel as though I disappoint people in my life.

I am conscious of it but what do I do with this information now? Has anyone felt like this before and what was your way to stop feeling like this?

TL;DR : I know my inner voice is very critical at times but I have no idea what to do with it. I've always been compared to and I am envious and bitter about other people's lives. Due to this, I sometimes get annoyed so easily. Has anyone faced this and has worked towards diminishing the critical inner voice?",21Sep2020,1

Earlier tonight I walked into the bathroom of my college dorm and no one was there except for someone at one sink. I looked down at the floor near the stalls and saw a huge dark bug at least the size of my thumb. I stepped back and blinked and I think it moved. I blinked again and saw something black fly up to the nearest stall. I stood there just looking and it was not there. I opened the stall door and couldn’t find it, then moved to the next two on either side. I looked up, down, everywhere in each stall multiple times. It’s not a big bathroom. Then I kept questioning if it was really there. I know this may sound silly but for some reason I don’t believe myself. Like I know I saw it, but I don’t know if it was actually there. This might sound strange but for the last half hour I have been obsessing over if I’m lying or not?? Which is weird because it’s like I don’t trust myself.

I don’t know where to start but I am hoping someone out there can help share their story. I am essentially looking for reassurance due to the current circumstances. I realize that nothing is ever certain but I am trying hard everyday to hold on to Hope and Faith. I am torn between science and spirituality though I would consider both intertwined.

Essentially, the love of my life has fell mentally ill. We aren’t married yet and she has been in the care of her Mother for almost two months now since her episode. Leading up to her current state she was a very lively individual. We both didn’t understand that she was on the verge to undergo her mental recovery but here we are. I am trying my hardest not to blame myself but thinking back to this point I just didn’t understand. We were in the process of removing as much stress in our lives and be more minimalistic when this happened. It has been an extremely hard experience for me and I can only imagine for her. Due to circumstances I cannot be by her side on the day to day and I just saw her today for the first time in a couple of weeks. She looks better but God/Universe knows I struggle to keep a positive outlook and speak positivity and life into her improvement. She isn’t anxious or showing signs of panic attacks I believe. I asked her if she is still thinking alot and she said yes. She was extremely apologetic and the hardest thing to deal with is even while she isn’t completely herself she focuses on my wellbeing. She also believes that everyone dislikes her and that she is a evil person. I try to reassure her that she isn’t but it doesn’t seem to help. She just got back to the point to where she will text a few words which occasionally are not as coherent. It is just so much. For the first two weeks of her recovery I was bedside sleeping on the floor next to her following her rhythm. Unfortunately, due to my job I had to leave back to my worksite and due to travel restrictions can not visit until weekends. I feel like things happened for a reason though because while I was there I felt as if I was hurting her recovery because she would focus on my wellbeing alot of the time and not herself. It pains me because I try to tell her to focus on herself but as I have so much Love for her she has it for me. Like the last thing I want for her is to focus on me when she needs to focus on self. I just said the same thing multiple times. My mind is in disarray. I guess I seeking peoples stories from both sides of the isle and I am wondering has anyone gone through this process holistically. Her family is reluctant to seek further medical advise because prior to her being cared for at home the experience at the hospital was horrifying. I don’t know what to do. Her family knows she will get better. I am trying to believe and know she will be fine but I am scared, sad, uncertain just everything. I believe she is getting better.

So I spend weekends with my partner, in their apartment, and when I have to go back to the little room that I rent, it is kind of jarring. I feel like I need time to adjust every Sunday, and just realize that even though I feel so safe and happy with my partner, their place is not my place and my life is not actually safe and happy. 

Plus, I work and go to school full time and when I'm with my partner it makes me forget that I need to strive for more. I just want to relax with them in my free time and not take classes anymore. 

I feel like maybe I wish we were together longer and could get married so their security could be mine, but I often grow resentful very early in relationships that they don't want to immediately make me feel safe. We haven't even been together a year and like, I've asked about moving in together and they think its too soon. 

So I need to accept that I have to work hard all the time for myself and it really weighs on any relationship that I have... because if I ever do become self-sufficient, I'll probably be too bitter by then to want to be with anyone. Why would I share my life with someone who didn't offer to pick up the slack when I needed it? Would I want to get married and share a home and bills and finances with someone who wasn't there when I needed them? Especially if I'm capable of doing it alone then.

I’m really trying to pretend like I’m okay and people keep telling me how amazed they are by how well I’m handling everything going on right now but I’m not handling anything. I’m just shoving all my feelings down and pretending like they don’t exist. 

My boyfriend of two years broke up with me a week ago and I miss him so fucking much. He was my everything and the person who I looked forwards to talking to every single day. He made me so happy. And now he’s gone and I don’t know how to handle that. Everyone just keeps telling me it’ll get better over time. I want to text him and tell him how much I want him back but I know that’s not fair. I need to respect his reasons and feelings for ending the relationship. It would be selfish of me to do anything else. But I can’t help crying every night at the thought of not getting to tell him goodnight. 

I’m really struggling in school right now too. I’m in college and with online classes it’s been really hard to learn. I’m practically teaching myself two  of my classes. It’s so hard. I spend all day studying and going to zoom calls. I don’t ever leave my dorm room except to go to the bathroom or to go to the dining hall once a day. I want time to myself but if I take that then I risk failing my classes and I can’t take that risk. I have a quiz tomorrow and instead of studying I listened to Green Day and crying. I know I’m going to fail the quiz tomorrow but I have no motivation. 

The anniversary of my dads death is in less than two weeks. He died in an accident when I was thirteen. I found his dead body. That image and the voice of the 911 operator telling me to breathe are something that never leaves my head. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD. The closer it gets to his death the more flashbacks and dreams I have. I can’t sleep because of it. 

After my dad died, my mom didn’t cope well. It was really really hard on her and she took out her frustrations on her kids. When I was a teenager she was emotionally abusive. She would call me names and was extremely controlling. My mental health was awful while living in my house. My mom is going to therapy and getting better but I still feel like I can’t talk to her about what’s going on and it sucks because I just want to turn to her and have her give me motherly comfort but I can’t. 

I looked down at my arm a little bit earlier and I saw all my self harm scars and it made me really want to self harm again. It also made me really sad. I don’t have anything to self harm with though and I promised myself a year and a half ago I wouldn’t ever do it again so I won’t do it but I still want to. I’ve also attempted to kill myself before and suicide is seeming like a good option right now but I know I could never actually do it. The thought of being dead makes me happy though. 

I’m having a huge mental breakdown and I’m just at a loss for everything. I don’t know what to do to deal with my sadness and my pain. I signed up for therapy with my university but my first appointment isn’t for another week and a half. I just want to curl up into a ball and ignore the world until I feel better. I want to talk to someone but I don’t have anyone to confide in. I wish I could do nothing. I wish I could call my ex and talk to his goofy ass that always made me laugh. 

I feel so unloved and lonely.",21Sep2020,1
72,"Not literally paralyzing, but it might as well be. I haven’t moved or done really anything at all for a month. I wake up, cry because I’m alive and then spend the whole day in bed thinking of things I should be doing, but no matter how much I try to push myself, nothing happens. My body doesn’t move and my thoughts race a thousand million miles an hour. I cannot focus on one thing, because the negative thoughts take the entire spotlight and I can’t run away, not even when meditating.

I’ve fought this depression for my entire life and I can feel it getting way worse every year.

I don’t talk to anyone anymore. I stopped caring about having a job or money. I don’t want to see or talk to anyone, but at the same time I feel so abandoned and alone.

Today I had a headache the whole day because I was feeling suicidal and other things happened that kind of stressed me out, and I just don’t know what to do anymore.

I’m... out of ideas. I just can’t get myself to do anything. I don’t even turn the TV on, for fuck’s sake. I don’t even feed myself! I haven’t eaten all day today and have been eating once a day for two weeks. 

I don’t like living like this. My last option is killing myself but I’m scared that it might actually come to that, because I’m just tired of everything and I’m not interested in whatever the future holds, even if it’s good, because I literally couldn’t care less about “experiencing” life when you die anyway.

If there is anyone with some ideas on how to tackle a depression that is this extreme, please let me know.

I really believe that, at this point, I am unable to fight this and I need extreme measures and help.

I’m sorry for being so negative, I really can’t help it.

Please, I need help. Once-a-week therapy and pills didn’t work. It feels so embarrassing to be such a failure in life for not being able to handle this myself like everyone else is. 

I don’t even know what joy feels like anymore, haven’t felt it in a few years. I am unable to enjoy any new activities I try or friends that I meet, so I decided to stay home and not waste my time on things that were requiring so much energy but were not making me feel better. It’s like now I am unable to feel love or any positive feeling from myself or anyone else.

My friends and family don’t know what to do and they just told me that I’m not trying hard enough or that it seems like I just don’t wanna try to get better. But it makes me furious because I’m trying my hardest and it’s been my entire life!!! How can you tell me I’m not trying when I’m still alive and I’m 26yo? Do people even care to give credit for what I have endured?!

I need help. I am extremely emotionally weak and it’s gotten to a point where I cannot do anything anymore. Just slowly waiting to die.

Tl;dr: I really really need help and advice. I have extreme depression that has ultimately taken control over me for the past three years. I have tried a million things and it’s only getting worse. I can see the clock ticking. Any advice on how to seek for help when you can’t do anything anymore?",21Sep2020,1
73,"I am still rather young(31). But I do have some issues with memory. It has become enough of a problem that my husband seems to be worrying. 

I have been planning to go to a therapist that works with a psychiatrist in the same office as my regular doctor. I have anxiety and ADD and some childhood trauma.

74,"I’ve having crippling mental health issues that have made working almost impossible and my relationships (work/family/social) have become totally broken. I reached out to my insurance and was suggested to take neuropsychological tests by a neuropsychologist that works in the same practice as my psychiatrist. Mid 30s with awful history (refugee with violent abusive dad and lonely childhood from being rejected by peers). I’m already diagnosed with PTSD, Generalized Anxiety disorder, chronic insomnia and panic attacks. There is many hints I’m on the autistic spectrum. I’ve already failed 5 antidepressants, antipsychotics, various other meds and only thing that’s even keeping me together is a benzodiazepines prescribed reluctantly for almost a year by my psychiatrist that can make me sleep and break an awful day/night. Wondering what I could get out of testing and how intense I can expect treatment to be.

75,"This may sound like rambling and I'm not sure where to start but I haven't been myself lately and I'm not sure how to fix this or how to get help.

Im 25 years old and I have always been extroverted, especially around friends, but lately I've felt very disconnected in social settings and just very disengaged and unhappy in general. I've always been able to make people laugh and make conversation and just talk. But now I'm unable to talk, nothing comes to my mind at all and I've noticed myself staying absolutely quiet in any social setting. I've also noticed nothing excites or makes me even happy. Whether it be plans, my future or even something simple like good food. My life is good. I'm not struggling financially, I have amazing friends and family, and I get to do things I enjoy pretty often. Yet I don't care anymore about any of it.

This summer I was crushing over this girl who I think is perfect and we even started dating last month. I'm sure she's picked up on this and she probably thinks I'm nervous or something as im unable to make  conversation or even text outside of small talk. She asked me what I wanted most in life/what was on my bucket list and I couldn't answer the question. Like I don't look forward to anything in the future. We've been seeing each other for a month and I really want this to work because she's amazing and one of the only things that makes me slightly happy of recent but I'm just not there and I don't feel like myself anymore. 

I feel like Ive ""checked out"" or something and I don't like it. I don't look forward to anything in life anymore and if I died right now I wouldn't mind. I wouldn't take my own life as I don't think I'm capable and it would destroy my parents but it's something that comes up sometimes.  

I should add that since last year I have started using certain psychoactive substances pretty sparingly. Smoking weed once or twice a week. Microdosing LSD and mushrooms once a month or so and a couple macrodoses this past summer. I'm thinking of taking a break from all of the above however.

76,"Hey all I've only posted here once I'm sorry I haven't been very active and also if the formatting is weird im on mobile. Anyway I've been going through some big changes and its really taken a toll on me mentally. I was injured pretty badly awhile ago and it took me away from training to do a job I've been dreaming of since I was little. Recently I reentered training and until now I've been fine but my injury seems to be flaring up again. On top of that I've been in a slow downward depressive spiral for about three weeks and its hard to talk about any of it because I myself just see my own complaints as more of an annoyance than a problem. I'm afraid that my injuries have unfortunately gone too far and will keep me from my dream, I just don't exactly know how to come to terms with this, I've practically built me and my fiancés life around this and now I feel as though for once I literally have no idea what to do. I know we can't stay in our small town and just be coasting by. Neither of us want that. But im also at a loss its almost like I've gotten the mental wind knocked out of me. On top of that its made it hard to help my fiancé with her mental illness problems. I've become so overly sensitive that even the slightest change in expression sends me into high alert. She has been working very hard on getting her anxiety and manic and depressive episodes under control and im so proud of her! But even though she reassures me its just her own head being terrible to her I get paranoid I've done something wrong or feel it is my fault. How can I stop this feeling so I can help her even more? And how can I come to terms with possibly being rejected from my dream? Thank you to anyone who reads!",21Sep2020,1
79,"so i have pretty bad anxiety and whenever i’ve tried to talk to family or counselors about what it is i’m feeling (i’m not able to see an actual therapist at the moment), a lot of the time i’ll hear something along the lines of “oh that’s perfectly normal” or “that’s alright i do the same thing” which i feel like should reassure me into feeling not alone, but instead it just makes me feel like i’m overreacting about my feelings since it’s apparently normal to feel. for example, i was talking to a counselor about the anxiety i get at school and how i feel constant paranoia about the smallest things and she responded like “well we all get anxious about doing certain things but it’s fine i do that too” and i know she was just trying to make me feel better but it just made me feel like maybe i was making too big of a deal and stressed me out way more..",21Sep2020,1

And I’ve had this horrible recurring thought/feeling over the years that I may have been s*xually *ssaulted as a small kid. It makes me feel absolutely horrible because I have no memory of something like that happening to me and how dare I even THINK about the possibility when there are real people out there who have been through something like that and they live with the memories and pain every day. But I’ve looked into it in the past and I’ve read posts by people who talk about stuff that hits too close to home for me to just completely brush off, and it would explain some of the things I would do when I was really young that I don’t know how else to explain. I feel like a terrible person for even considering it but at the same time it just feels like it fits and... I don’t know, I just had to get it out of my head so I hopefully feel less like the scum of the earth or something. Sorry.",21Sep2020,1
81,"I am a 20 year old male college student. I have had focus issues all my life.

Never wrote in my school agenda despite daily reminders from my mom throughout middle school.

Last year, I zoned out in 95% of my lectures, and this year is even worse with online school. There’s this switch that flips five minutes into class where I zone out and I can’t refocus. My brain blocks it out and I can’t stop it. 

I get hyper focused on the wrong things and I can’t stop. It’s always “one more hour” until the whole day goes by. This goes for Netflix, Side Projects, business ideas, a formula I want to crack, etc..

I’ve always wondered if I had ADD or ADHD. Never been diagnosed, but I sympathize with almost every symptom I learn about.

Whether I have it or not, my lack of focus is out of hand. And my mind is always thinking about something else that it can’t stop even when I know I should.

I think it’s leading to terrible sleep schedules and a screen addiction too.

I’m finally acknowledging I can’t manage this on my own. What do I do next? Do I suck it up and live like this? Is there a better way to manage this? Can I get medicated?",21Sep2020,1

I want to cry so badly but like idk why, i feel like it could be partially that I miss my boyfriend but other than that I shouldn’t be really sad about that since I saw and talked to him today.

I have trouble with relationships with the people around me and i just start to feel unwanted so i distance myself from everything. i just want to have a stable mind i guess i don’t want to be super sad all the time, i only feel depressed when i’m alone but i hate my stepfather so i don’t want to go hangout upstairs with my mom, both of my siblings have moved out and barley come around anymore so i just feel alone in this house. i feel like i have to support from anyone mentally and i have to deal with all of my problems by myself. I have tried to talk about how i feel with my parents but both of them have just told me when i’m feeling down to just “snap out of it” . 
i have started hanging out with some of my old friends from middle school cause when high school started i went to a different one and i’m gonna try and switch because i think i’ll have more friends then i will at this school. when I start to feel really bad about myself i write poetry, it probably explains how i feel better then this word vomit above. i don’t want to re read it so sorry for typos.

No Support
I don’t feel welcome 
I don’t feel excepted 
I feel like the universe is trying to send me a message
that all the people around are just human messes 
that I don’t fit in cause it doesn’t want me to be infected
infected with a mindset that sets me back
sometimes it makes me want to bite the strap
i feel like i’m trapped
feel like my situation is capped
what is my life like, is it already mapped
what do I do
I have no role models 
no one to look up to
I feel like i’m in a zoo
not in my natural habitat 
i don’t mesh and i feel attacked 
they don’t really care 
neither do I
I just wanna fly away
throw all of my troubles away
i feel abandoned by myself i feel betrayed
I have no one else call me a stray
my mind is frayed 
nothing makes sense
i was born and my life was designed to make cents
i wish i was born with no modern civilization 
no gas stations 
when i’m at school i feel board 
like a rope around my neck i feel choked 
for this life i am not stoked
but like a fire i’m going out like i’m not toked 
like my necklace is a rope
i don’t know how i cope
one day at a time 
that’s what they say
alone with my mind 
that’s how i feel all the time
even when i’m with “friends”
they don’t care that i’m there
i’m just another face in a crowd
i wanna scream but can make a sound
if they knew how much i frowned 
maybe they would stick around 
feel like a king uncrowned 
feel like a fish that can drown
cant make sense this world is astound
all the hate, disasters, “go to school and get a masters”
nothing makes sense 
it’s greener on the other side of the fence 
i can smell the hate the bad stench 
they don’t understand me like french 
i’m not apart of the crowd 
cause of what’s behind my brow
the mind of my fathers and my brothers
we’re just the same
inside we feel blame
i do not feel the same
feel so old need a cane 
wish i was dead who would they frame
i really wish that you came
when i’m with you i feel sane
like i’m not the one to blame
no one likes me no fame
feel like the blue part of the flame
on this world i’m a stain

Now all I do is compare myself to every person I see and mentally beat myself up when someone looks healthier than me so u know my self esteem is just great~ but in all seriousness it's gotten rlly bad, to the point that I p*nch my stomach in frustration and feel worthless whenever I binge eat.
My anxiety and stress levels have been through the roof and I've been having stress dreams for nights in a row.

Im usually very open with my parents about my mental health but I've closed off a bit because my parents don't really understand mental health?? they think it's like something that I only feel in the moment, Like they'd be supportive and comforting when I open up but get frustrated and mad when it starts effecting their life's.

With all that and school, it's just very tiring. I try to hype up my friends to make sure that at least they can feel good abt themselves but it's HURTS especially when my totally healthy friend talks bad abt herself when im literally 20+ pounds heavier than her :|

87,"I’m at 23f that’s struggled with depression on and off since roughly 13 years old. I’ve seen therapists throughout this time but struggled with consistency due to financial costs. I recently scheduled appointments to start back up in a few weeks as I’ve now hit a rough spot again but I’m worried about the level of depression I’m feeling.

Just to start I haven’t harmed myself in any way or actively planned it. But I’m experiencing days where I feel so unmotivated I have to literally drag myself out of bed. After 8 hours of work I feel so exhausted I sleep for hours immediately when I’m done. And when I wake back up I’m filled with such an intense feeling of boredom and apathy. Then at night I struggle to fall asleep and just feel completely encompassed in overwhelming sadness. I don’t break down and cry, just like I’m smothered in it and struggling to break past it unless I’m so exhausted I can’t keep my eyes open. 

Is this something that therapy alone can solve? Should I push for medication at this point? In patient therapy? Idk, it just feels so heavy and I don’t know how best to fix it.",21Sep2020,1
88,"I have a feeling that is always with me, it’s the feeling of the time lost. It’s the feeling of wanting to go back and relive all the moments I still hold onto. I’m 22 and I’ve been single now for almost 3 years. Every time a girl tries to flirt with me or ask me out, I will have a reason to put it off or turn her away. I can’t let go of my ex. I think about her all the time. I don’t understand how people say there are “in love” or something because all my friends (or just people in general) just date people and get dumped or dump they ex and then just say bad things about then and trash talk them. That’s not love! You can’t just say you love someone and then turn around and put them down with your words. I used to believe live wasn’t real. But after I feel in love, I realized it was real. She doesn’t love me anymore and needed a new life without me, and I love her so much I just want her to be happy and feel loved. Even if that person isn’t me. She deserves it. I miss her every moment of the day and I don’t have anything bad to say about her. She is beautiful and sweet and sexy. But that’s not the reason I feel in love with her. I fell in love with her because her heart is love. She is everything people hope to be, but never can reach to. She truly puts others before herself and cares about other people’s feelings. She is the girl who stops by the dog shelter every day after work and plays with the dogs who don’t have anyone to love on them. She’s the girl who meets you at 2:30 AM in the Walmart parking lot to let you cry and explain why you aren’t feeling strong. I don’t know how to explain how her heart really is because I don’t know any other person to compare it to. Her heart is what I feel in love with. It was just icing on the cake that she was pretty. I will always love her. And I’m not suicidal anymore. I just feel really alone and I know I’m going to be alone, but I just didn’t realize how hard this would be. It’s not a pain that suddenly falls on you, it’s a deep pain that creeps it’s way in slowly day by day, Month by month, year by year. I just hope the pain slows down because it’s a lot to hold sometimes. Anyways... sorry for the rant. I hope this finds someone",21Sep2020,1

I don't insist on the conversation because I feel like a burden and if they feel happy in their life I don't want to be the reason why it's not okay anymore. 

Social media...I've shared things, a lot of things, regarding mental health and how it's sad how people always say ""the signs were there, i wish I would've seen them before"". I think about this a lot. 

For a few months now I've experienced that myself. Nobody has bothered to message me if I'm okay, not ""friends"" or ""family"". I started thinking if I were to end things, not saying that Im suicidal but putting myself in others shoes, people would just say the exact same thing that they always say ""I wish I would've...."" and then they'd feel horrible for not seeing the signs. 

Yes, it is my responsibility to seek help, this feeling right now is just temporary. I'm not suicidal. But it hurts. It hurts to feel alone. It hurts to feel like you have nobody in your life. I hurts to feel like your throwing signs out and nobody cares or is paying attention. 

Is this what people feel when they're contemplating their life? Maybe I am suicidal and I'm in denial because I feel guilty and I should never think that way because I have kids and it's selfish of me to think that way.

96,"I've been through a lot, and maybe one of the things I hated and wanted to drag myself out of- my addiction to cannabis- was a blessing in disguise. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's mainly a psychological addiction. It's a craving like no other craving I've ever expierienced.

I won't get into a whole lot of specifics other than I've never lived in an environment where everyone I've lived with was good to me, and I've been abused by so many of the people I've been close to. I have never lived in a place where I felt wanted, or even welcome.

I was abused by a doctor who tried to get me naked with no good reason (he could have asked questions to find out what he wanted to know), got mad at me for not getting naked, and broke HIPPA to tell my mom I was transgender to cover up his tracks because he knew she wouldn't believe me if she thought I was just angry about that and trying to get him into trouble. I was a minor and very scared of my parents, who would not have taken well to me trying to report this doctor, especially being that he gave them info they wanted to know.

My abusive ex moved into my dorm room on my first day of college without giving me a choice. He also pushed me to smoke a ton of weed, among other drugs.

By the end of the school year I realized that I had a huge problem. I couldn't function without weed and I constantly craved it. It dulled the pain of being around him and having a nasty past. If I didn't smoke i would sit in class just thinking about how bad I needed it, how good it would feel to just take that first puff, how amazing it would be to smoke a bowl and go pile up a ginormous salad in the dining hall afterwards. What's weird though, is that I actually seemed to focus a lot better in class when I was high.

This is the first time in almost 2 years that I've been able to decide to stop smoking weed when I had the choice to. My partner(not the nasty guy) is proud of me, and I feel like I'm letting him down with my current realization- I don't want to be able to remember all these things that keep flooding back. I dont want my brain to work right. 

I just turned 21 and I've been drinking, but recognizing that I've been drinking a lot, and I've already made rules for myself about it, because seeing how hard it's been to quit smoking weed, I dont want to start drinking like that, but...

I think in order to keep myself away from alcoholism and keep myself from the pain of living those memories over and over again and having them keep me up all night just isnt worth it. I need to smoke. I need to get high. I need to forget. 

Weed makes me hate myself a lot less. I enjoy my life more when I'm high. I'm not as anxious or depressed. I'm just so tired.

Maybe I'm not in the right mindset. Who knows? I'll bring it up to my therapist next time i see her. She did tell me that it takes around 6 months of abstaining to start feeling good after an addiction. Maybe she's right, and I just need to relearn how to deal with the memories.

Maybe I'm just really badly addicted. Before I smoked I had no trouble dealing with all the abuse I suffered emotionally. I had no issue powering through everything. I'm so tired now. I'm so so so tired.

The weird thing is, when bad things happen to me now, theres no emotional reaction, no feelings attached other than guilt if my mom is trying to manipulate me, even though I know that's exactly what's happening.

The really emotional things and the things that mess me up to think about are deep in my past. It takes me a long time to realize how traumatic something is and when it hits me it kills me and smoking puts a stop to it.

I'm depressed and anxious to the point where I would be considered disabled if I had the motivation to go through and confirm that. I can't work. I can't remove myself from my horrible living situation. My parents have called the cops on me as an adult and somehow convinced them to make me take a ride in a squad car back home. 

Im trapped. Im being isolated. I haven't seen some of my closest friends in over a year and a half because my parents wont let me. Im 21 and I just cant do anything without the approval of my parents. The 2-3 horr screaming fest and ripping apart my room every time aren't worth it. They keep telling me they'll do anything to help yet they make it worse constantly. 

Why are they so strict? Because they think marijuana will kill me before I kill myself when they won't let me leave the house or have any money. 

In all reality, I'm not planning on killing myself but because of chronic illness as well as such severe mental illness I can't fathom any escape. For God's sake my parents are rich and will pay for the best lawyers to get a conservatorship over me before they let me leave, and even if I were to somehow get out of it, they would make my life hell in every way possible.

Im so damn tired.",21Sep2020,1

I don’t have motivation to do anything and I’m just...I’m exhausted. My mind never shuts off and sleeping is really the only way I can get a break. Between the anxiety, depression, bpd, and minor schizophrenia, I’m losing it. I don’t feel sane anymore. I feel like I’m on autopilot all day and I’m just passing through.

101,"I'm not a mean person, nor shy, but I straight up do not emotionally connect with most people. I have a fiance, I care about my sister, and I was really attached to my dog (like devastated, in a deep depression when she died), but that's pretty much it. I've always had friends (up until I graduated college) but I never really cared when most of them fell out of my life (usually due to me not responding or contacting them). I always felt like I was just keeping up being friends with people because that was expected of me.

It doesn't help that I have terrible terrible memory. Like, I don't remember how most of my past ""friends"" were as people or how I interacted with them, things I did with them, etc. I have straight up forgotten the existence of people that I spent a lot of time with only a few years ago (and then my fiance will bring it up and I'm like ""holy shit I FORGOT they existed""). I wonder if that has anything to do with the reason I don't really miss people? I guess I don't remember what I'm supposed to miss.

Part of me feels like I need to go to therapy, but my life had been basically coasting on easy mode outside of some depression problems when I was younger and college stress.",21Sep2020,1
102,"lately i’ve been feeling really depressed.... it’s nothing out of the ordinary but i’m scared that i might do something impulsive... 
i’ve been thinking of purchasing a firearm (illegally cuz i live in canada) and finally putting an end to myself, but i don’t know if i’ll be able to actually manage it. there are lots of things to consider, place, time, date, how strong the firearm is, will i be able to pull the trigger and make sure the bullet ends up killing me in an instant rather than just severely damaging me.

honestly these are things i think of every day because i try to find death in every scenario (for example, going somewhere as innocent as the mall means taking the train which is a potential thing i can use to k!ll myself). it’s ridiculous because i can’t manage to do anything without thinking of ways i can end myself. 

anyway, as i said, this is nothing new, but i’m always impulsive and i get in risky situations all the time, so if i DO purchase anything i’ll basically HAVE TO end myself cuz the thought of owning a firearm is scary, and also the money isn’t mine, so if i don’t kill myself that means i’ll have to live and explain to the person why half their money is gone lmfao. 

i have lots of issues (i’m an 18 y/o female) like ED, anxiety, panic disorder, and severe depression and whatever, i stopped speaking w my friends a few weeks ago and stopped speaking to my therapist too ((he never even bothered to call or text back which made me quite sad :/ )) i also stopped taking my meds cuz i was too exhausted but it’s only been a few days so i’m gonna try to force myself to take them... 

anyway, i just need an opinion on how to get by for now without doing anything reckless.

108,"I had selective mutism as a young child. I may be a HSP but am not sure. I started trichotrillonomia at age 12 but it’s very mild now. I’ve always had some obsessive overthinking. I am almost positive I have a deviated septum. The ENT doctor mentioned I had sinusitis and gave me nasal spray a while ago. I have Tourette’s syndrome although it doesn’t interfere with daily life too much. I’m pretty sure my mom is emotionally abusive/ narcissist/ controlling. I have been able to keep close friends easily but think I may have social anxiety or anxiety. J was recently diagnosed with inattentive adhd. I couldn’t focus on professors no matter how much I told myself to focus and started at the screen- I’ve been like this since I was a young kid. Focusing on assignments felt impossible. I know I’m smart and motivated enough to do much better in school but my grades are very bad. I startle very easily. I have convergence isnfuciciancy I think it is part of adhd. I remember in class not being able to see a color pencil held on the side of my head for an experiment &amp; all the other kids could. I’ve always naturally started walking towards the grass or diagonally one the sidewalk and had trouble looking around where I was going. Adderall helps with this and fixes it. I had to issues reading because I couldn’t comprehend and anything and my eyes naturally skipped but Adderall helps this too. It was helping with self doubt issues before but I feel like I constantly wonder if I’m a good person and what Is wrong with me. I’ve always had a nasal voice that sounds helium like naturally &amp; a bit of valley girl speak which I try to control. My mom says she thought I had oppositional defiance disorder but I don’t relate to that in anyway and have no issue following instructions. I feel like I get sick very easily and my sicknesses last a long time. My sophomore year of hs- me &amp; this one other girl were sick for three months but I never got a diagnosis because strep and mono came back negative. It was like I was constantly hacking coughing &amp; couldn’t laugh or speak without hacking my lungs out. Some people say sleep apnea causes adhd but I’m slightly underweight not overweight &amp; don’t wake up in the middle of the night. Before I got nasal spray I was unable to even drink water or chew food without gasping for air after because I had no ability to breath.

I saw some of these things are comorbodies with EDS  but I don’t have chronic pain. I do have some of the other symptoms though

111,"there's alot of bugs and pests where i live. this past year, i had found a new way of getting back at the bugs that bother me. i'd bought a few small glasses and jars, and saw best use to them to take the bugs that always found their way in my room and put them in the jar. at first it was to kill them indirectly. i'd fill the jar up with water and wait until the bug drowned. but later i just kept them there. didnt want to kill them anymore. there was this one spider that i kept for four months before it finally died.  yesterday, a big moth came through my window. i caught it and put it in a jar again. i think i broke its wings, because it wouldnt fly away anymore. it only moved its legs and body. in the jar, it couldnt move at all. i guess that gave me a morbid idea that if i took it out of the jar, it still couldnt go anyway. it was just alive. so without thinking about it much i went ahead and picked a few of my art supplies, namely water paint, took out the moth and started colouring it dark shades of blue and green. it looked pretty to me, but the whole time the moth was alive. still is. i knew i was putting the thing through a lot of stress but i didnt stop anyway. at one point i almost put the painted moth in my mouth. i dont know why. after i was done i put it back in the jar. it's still there. i understand what i did wasnt normal. im disturbed, but not freaking out yet. what bothers me most is that i know if another moth comes flying in, i'll do the same thing to it. i enjoyed doing it, and i guess that lack of regret, and the sudden urge to eat the moth were both the things that weirded me out the most.",21Sep2020,1
113,"Hi, I'm 19 years old male college student. I'm currently studying Psychology yet it seems that I'm not able to help myself.

I had severe depression last year because of issues in my class, rejection, and being in a wrong cycles of friends. Long story short my life last year is so messed up. I even self harmed last year and I have to rely on xanax (antidepressant) to make myself calm and to make myself sleep. I also have known that my so called friends are backstabbing me. Now I have trust issues.

Today, I thought I learned and become a better version of myself but still. The pain and sadness I'm feeling is never ending. It is because my ex gf left me during my birthday, it's been 5 months now since we broke up but I still can't move on even though we no longer have contacts for 5 months and I have removed and deleted everything that could remind me of her.

To make things worse my gf probably talked to most of our classmates and ruined me a lot from her story. Of course she also told it about those back stabbers which made them happier so they can ruin me a lot more. I can't believed that I even begged my ex for her to be back but nothing happens. I even went to her house during this pandemic but of course, it is such waste of time because her grandma simply told me that she wasn't there when I went there.

I am very broken and it feels like I was beyond repair. I got rid of my social media accounts and I was not able to talk to anyone for so long.

I can't even tell my mom that I think I should be back for antidepressants again because we're having problems financially.

I'am very tired and I really want to sleep but my stupid brain always reminds me these horrible experiences from my past. I'm starting to be suicidal again and I don't know what to do anymore.

All my gf do is cry and cry and cry and cry and cry then tell and tell and tell and tell and tell to others how disgusting of a person I'am. She is very pessimistic and it is extremely rare for me to see her being positive and optimistic. She is one hell of a negative person. Yet my stupid self keeps missing her and wanting her.

I'm tired...I want rest but I can't...my pain seems never ending...I don't know what to do anymore.",21Sep2020,1
114,"I don’t know who to talk to about this. I posted on another sub and it was rejected because I didn’t ask the right question.

I’ve (30F) been diagnosed with major depression and after 3 years of therapy and a year on new medication I’ve changed for the better. I feel really happy and in control of my illness and mental health.

Husband (35M) and I never talked about kids much, we’re married 4 years , together for 10. In the beginning he wasn’t interested in kids and I was ok with that and assumed we weren’t having any. We had a rough time for the first 2 years of marriage but after I got help we’re doing great and both happy. But it’s still hard to talk about “serious” things - specifically kids, he doesn’t really like discussing the future and he says “well we’re not ready so no point in talking about it”. It feels weird to me, I feel like normal couples talk about it (whether they want to or not) what their parenting philosophy is etc. 

My issue is that i think he is thinking about it and doesn’t want to be childfree anymore. Which at the start of marriage was ok for me (I didn’t mind if he really wanted children) but now I’m starting to think I can’t do it. I’ve lived my whole relationship mentally thinking I’m not going to be a mother. Now I realise I don’t think I’d be a good mother and I don’t know if our marriage could survive it. I feel like it’s taken a lot to get to where we are now and if we have a child in a few years time it could ruin it. Whenever people talk about kids it just looks like so much sacrifice and hard work. I understand it’s rewarding and fulfilling but you have to give up so much of yourself and I feel like I mentally wouldn’t be able to handle that. 

I’m much better with my mental illness now but I still struggle so much with getting things done around the house especially when I’m working. I do the bare minimum to get by and my husband does a lot of the chores. Has anyone dealt with this before? Did you decide you weren’t having kids but changed your mind? I want to tell my husband I don’t want to have kids but I don’t want to shut the door completely if things could change in a few years. 

My therapist tells me not to worry and I have 10 years to decide. I want to go to marriage counselling with my husband but he doesn’t think we need it. I don’t know if I’m overthinking it and “jumping the gun” and need to let things take it’s course. I’m not a “wait and see” kind of person I get anxious and depressed if I don’t know where my future is going and if I don’t have a plan. We are also South Asian so my mom tells me I’ll regret it if I don’t have kids while I can. It’s an elephant in the room when I see my in laws or friends and family our age with kids (no one is pressuring us thankfully but I’m always conscious about how we don’t have any and are not planning on it) 4 years is a long time in our families to be married without kids.

115,"Hi I'm new here. I really hope I don't step on anyone's toes here. I read the rules, and from what I understand, this is okay to reach out about. Sorry if I'm rambling. I'm super nervous to reach out about this.

Okay, so I'm having an absolute mental breakdown and legitimately considering suicide, as in getting the letter written in my head.  The walls are closing in. The catalyst was an abusive relationship I just ran away from. I feel like my soul left my body.

I live in extreme geographical isolation. I have many friends from all over. I know I am not truly alone, but right here and right now the walls are closing in.

There is no other way out.

I also live in an area where mental health doesn't really exist and is super taboo. 

I had a psychiatrist before and stopped going. I thought my anxiety had disappeared. I thought I could be better on my own.

I reached out to him again and made an emergency appointment first thing in the morning. Finding him in itself is an absolute miracle. Actually mental health clinics and professionals in general aren't really a thing, so medication is really the only help I can get right now. I'm desperate and I'll take what I can get. 

I lied to my employer stating that I need this appointment during company hours because ""of a serious internal issue"" and I need to travel to this specific office's location because ""it is a specialist"". When asked a bit more, I said it was ""severe stomach issues--can't keep anything down"". This also isn't a complete lie.

The employer was sympathetic to what I said. 

How else can I lie tomorrow if I'm asked to provide more information? Do I just say ""I'm not fully understanding the issue and they need to run some tests?"" Blah blah blah? 

If asked for a doctor's note I'm just going to say ""gosh I'm so sorry I was in such a hurry to get back to work!""

Admitting to a mental health issue could legitimately result in termination and destroy my career as a whole. I could be unemployable for now on if the truth is found out. No, I can't quit or just get a new job. I'm literally bound to this. I actually like the job enough, I'm just at a loss here.

116,"Hey sorry if this isn’t right for the subreddit, but I’ve been going through a lot lately and my anxiety has skyrocketed. Because of recent events (and how I’ve reacted to them), I think I may be bipolar or having some sort of episode. I was diagnosed with depression &amp; anxiety in high school, but I’m 20 now and haven’t seen a professional for probably four years now. 

From what past therapists have told me, therapy is a tool to get you to a healthy enough mental space that even though you’re dealing with things you can handle them in a healthy way. I feel that I do this and I honestly am proud of the way I handle things, but sometimes panic attacks get too much. 

Because of some things that have happened to me recently I’ve found myself having panic attacks that I can pull myself out of. All of this because I think after years of dealing with my mental health (about 10 yrs), I’m able to cope now in healthy ways and realize pain is temporary when it gets really bad. Although I’m saying this, I feel that when I have really bad anxiety I can’t go on with my day to day life. I’m bed ridden basically for days or weeks only because the physical aspects are crippling for me. I have stomach issues, can’t sleep, and I can’t eat because I just throw it all up which in turn makes me weak because I’m not eating. 

I just feel therapy isn’t beneficial for me because I think I deal with these things healthily; I talk to people, get out as much as I can, have positive thoughts, etc. But sometimes my body just doesn’t let me physically. Therefore, I feel like there’s not much a therapist could tell me or help me with because I’m genuinely using the normal “therapy advice” and coping mechanisms to their full potentional. 

I feel like I need an outside perspective on my situation. I’m thinking maybe a psychologist/iatrics appointment would better fit my needs just to manage the panic attacks? Also because I’d really prefer not to be on anti depressants or anything that may change my moods long term from past experience. Thank you in advance!",21Sep2020,1

120,"I'm venting at the moment, but I would love any help I can get. Warning: I am being blunt as heck.

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder when I was 19. This was after I drove myslelf to the hospital because I was feeling uncontrolably suicidal. I laid in bed for 5 hours waiting for a social worker, and after a 15 minute talk, it was determined that I should spend some time at our local suicide prevention center. I stayed for 3 days, talked to a psychiatrist over web-cam for 15 minutes, and was prescribed zoloft. I took those for 8 months, 50mg, but it only made things more foggy than they already are.

That hospital trip cost me $3000, and I haven't paid a cent. I'm $1,500 in debt for schooling that I have no degree to show for it. I quit my job printing donald trump tshirts in february because it hurt my soul. I now live off of unemployment, don't have therapy, and am very much struggling.

I used to always have suicidal thoughts, but those have dampened as they seemed to be my greatest issue. I have been working on it. I also have friends now who would miss me. This is a problem, though. I keep finding myself angry with them over the smallest things, and they are my best friends. That hurts my feelings a lot, and makes me feel like a bad guy. It is pretty irrational, and I try so hard to stop. I feel the pain of 1000 needles any time I am passive aggressive or just normal aggressive.

Besides for that, I only ever want to be alone. I wamt to tell everyone that they can go fuck off and die, but that doesn't make any sense to me. Simply, I don't understand why lately I have been so prone to anger when I know that I am generally kind. It feels as if something is wrong with me, but I will never find out what that is. These days are flying by so fast that nothing seems important anymore. Nothing is fun. It has been happening for months, and I would only like for it to stop.

I am generally pretty active in life. I have been watering my tomato plants, and I cook at least a meal a day. Still, though, I'm wading through the same depressive waters and I don't know how to get out. Marijuana really helps for me to manage my trauma, but not this. I can smoke a bowl or take a dab to calm myself down or to really analytically think about something, but it doesn't take away my pain. I can't even think of a prospect that would make me happy, nor do I have any dreams. I have everything that I've ever wanted in life at 20 (A computer/Girlfriend/Room/Food/Cat/Friends).

129,"Megan was a patient of mine, whose life was taken too soon. She was a girlfriend, a daughter, and a mother, and based on how she was treated, she was seen more as an addict than a patient with an addiction. 

She tried to get herself off heroin and went to me to treat her anxiety that inevitably formed. But then I got questioned whey I was giving a former heroin addict suboxone.

It did not matter that she was taking the steps to treat herself. That she was doing the things she needed to do to help her daughter and mother. No matter what she was doing, the DEA just saw her as an addict.

The DEA felt the diversion risk she posed was greater than the addiction she was trying to overcome.

They didn't get that she would get anxiety when she got clean. Apparently mental health for a former addict is a crime.

As a result, she fell out of the healthcare system and into despair and depression.

She committed suicide a few days before her daughter's birthday.

In memory of her I began the start of my opioid education initiative that has since grown into so much more.

Now I'm hosting an IAmA later today, ostensibly to discuss my opioid project, my book, and my experiences as a physician in dealing with the opioid crisis.

But what I have learned, and what I plan to discuss more, is this immense, yet chaotic healthcare - for lack of better term - influence that exists in Reddit. There is no one person that controls the healthcare conversation, and we all know the varying degrees of posts and conversations that take place here.

Yet amidst the chaos like some organizational force, some influence, that can be used in a positive way. I do not know how, but over the course of my fundraising efforts, I will encourage dialog in which I discuss my work, but more learn from everybody how they use Reddit to discuss healthcare.

Listen, as much as we would like to believe, there is more we do not know than know about COVID-19, the opioid epidemic, and indeed so much about healthcare. And people are scrambling for data to figure it out.

I am interested to see how and why we say what we do and we post what we post. That would go a long way in understanding our own thoughts and our own perceptions of healthcare.

In many ways, we should be leading the research efforts and conversations that take place on Reddit. This platform has more users than any healthcare system has patients.

We all can carve out our own personal space to do good if we just know how we can help each other.

I've been dealing with not being able to feel emotions and I've come to the realization that I may be apathetic. Like I genuinely just cannot feel any emotion, I just go by the day as a hollow shell.

I hate not being able to feel, I've been thinking of going to therapy for it but I do not know what to say. I'm sick of feeling like a robot and just going about the day empty. I'm assuming it's from my battles with my mental health, and as a last resort my body just shut off all emotions to cope. I hate it.

Does anyone that has suffered from apathy or just knows anything can tell me how to get rid of it? Or do I have to go to therapy (I dread having to go because I know ill mess up and not say the right things)",21Sep2020,1

135,"I'll need to put a little context, I'm below 18, and I'm an introverted teenager, i have friends but i don't enjoy being with them.

So, when i was a kid, my uncle, who was in the military, died, and everyone in my family cried, everyone except me and a few other people.

I was quite close to him, i never hated him, i remember whenever he would visit my home he would make up lies about his time in the military, and as a dumb kid, i believed him, he never exposed me to guns, and i was never really fond with them.

When i was around the age of 12, my uncle died, and that's where i realized something, i didn't feel sad.

I'm not trying to act 'cool' or 'badass' I'm actually confused, I'm a human, and another human died, and i didn't cry.

I didn't feel sad at all, i didn't feel happy as well, i don't know why but it just felt normal.

""Everyday thousands of people die, why should i cry over one?"" i said that to myself when i went home.

I remember my relatives telling me about how strong i was, but i didn't feel a thing, i just accepted it.

Right now I'm much older, and i heard news about another of my relative's dying.

I wasn't close with this relative, so i think it was normal that i didn't feel sad, but since i was older, i was curious.

Why was everyone crying? i said to myself.

I went back home, then went onto YouTube, there, i searched for videos about murders, shootings, bombings, and whenever i would check the comments, i would always see people talk about how sad it was that innocent people died.

I watched a video talking about the Sandy Hook Shooting, and when i heard that 27 children and teachers died, i just thought ""It's not even that much""

I don't like the way i think, i want to change, i wanted to change, so that's why i kept on watching more videos about shootings, serial killings, and murder.

I wanted to feel sad, i wanted to feel sadness.

And yet i didn't feel a thing, i just thought it was normal, i thought that death was just normal.

To me, life is just a cycle, we are born, we go to school, and graduate, we get a job then we work and work and work until we get old enough to get retirement money, and anyone who goes against this cycle, is either poor or stupidly rich.

To me, we are just slaves to fate.

But of course i want to change, i don't want to have such a heartless heart when it comes to death.

Am i mentally ill? i can speak properly, my grades are average, and i live a normal life, its not abusive and its not luxurious.

I remember seeing an article online about writing a book to try and change your view of things, i didn't know how to write back then, but i was desperate to change.

I opened Microsoft word and taught myself, a person who never even wrote a single story before, to start writing,

I just wrote what ever was on my mind, i didn't change anything in my story, i just wrote what i was thinking of at that moment.

It was a story about a high school boy with no heart (in terms of emotions) who died and woke up in another world, there, he would find change, and he would go on to become a hero who lights the world with happiness.

It was a short story, no longer than 2000 words, and it was really badly written, the first lines were along the lines of 'The sky was blue and the sun was yellow, the yellow light of the sun went into the window beside Ken', it was like a children's story, written by a child (teenager specifically).

I since deleted the boring story, and now started writing a new one, this time, i made the character resemble me, he was heartless, like the first story i made, but this time, i made him stay this way.

I made about 7 chapters of this story, each less than 600 words.

I also deleted this story, but the plot of this particular story was something i passed onto another story.

I started writing a new one, i uploaded it on Wattpad, but the last i updated it was a few weeks ago, and i doubt ill ever update it again, I'm not going to post the link to my story, moderators might think I'm doing this for free advertising.

I'm still the same, I can still laugh, i can still smile, but i can't feel sad over the death of another.

When i heard that about 1 million people died from the virus, i thought 'Well, that's quite low'.

I just want to change, i want to think like other people, i want to have a heart, a heart that can ache for another person.

Right now I'm older, and yet i still feel the same.

Tl;Dr- I Can't feel sad over the death of another person, even if that person were to be close to me, how can i change?",21Sep2020,1
136,"To the math teacher that hates me for no reason

I live in Germany and school just started for me like a month ago. In this month Math we wrote 2 Tests and one class test. On the first test I got a 5 (E in American Grade System) on the second Test I got a 6 (F) since I apparently cheated eventhough I didn’t. Basically what happened, he handed out the tests and he said „we’ll first go through it once for questions so no writing!“ I was like „Okay no writing!“ but then after 2 minutes I heard the cap of a pen fall and I saw another person writing so that’s why I started writing because i thought we could write now. Then the math teacher said „Ok I have seen 4 people who I think started writing.“ Then he called me and 3 other people to his desk and he saw that we started writing so he confiscated our tests and gave us a 6 (F). So then we had to wait through the whole 15 minutes doing nothing while others wrote the test.At the end of the lesson he called us four and asked what was wrong and we explained to him that we were very confused and saw others writing already but he still wasn’t very convinced. On the very first day of school he already announced a class test so i thought that’d be my chance now. I studied countless hours and did like 10 pages of exercise. Well guess what I got today? A 5+ (E+). Now everything was for nothing.While others cry because they got a 3 (C) I am getting my 70th 5 (E). In seventh grade I had to get therapy because my mental health was in such a bad condition because of school. And since first grade I have never gotten an A in math. I have never got to know the accomplishment of getting an A in Math. And every week I have to worry about my future life because nobody of the teachers wants to understand me. Btw after the second math test my French teacher who is also our overall class teacher noticed that I was angry so she asked what’s wrong. I told her about the math test and talked to the math teacher. Well next lesson he talks to me and pretends to be innocent and that everything’s going to be fine.
I have had enough! 

Has anybody got any advice for me on how to cope with this?

139,"I am sick of my mum saying completely pointless things to me to convince herself that she’s trying to make me feel better and when I call her out in it she gets angry and passive aggressive. She’ll say things like ‘there’s no point feeling X,Y’ ‘You need to stop being negative’ along with other things I can’t remember at the moment, not in a supportive way but in a kind of annoyed way. If I could turn off my feelings and put away all the shit and intrusive thoughts in my head then I wouldn’t need fucking therapy would I? Sometimes I feel like she is all I have so when she gets angry over things like this and completely misunderstands my problems I feel completely alone. I can only see my therapist maximum once a week, I don’t really have any friends at all let alone any who understand mental health, I have no one who I am important to other than family who either deny, don’t know about or misunderstand my issues, my dad is a narcissistic prick, the teachers who I trust are always busy and I can’t see them outside lessons cause of coronavirus, it’s sad that the only place I can express my emotions is fucking reddit. I’ve been having an existential crisis for months if not years and it got really intense during my maths exam today where I felt completely negative about life as a whole. I have nothing. The time I should have spent revising I spent either looking at my ceiling thinking about death for hours or doing the few things I enjoy to convince myself that there is a point to living, I especially needed to do that after not being able to do literally anything because of lockdown. 

 I can’t stop thinking about the fact that I’m a complete outcast who no one wants to spend time with apart from people I train with and that is the only thing they do with me, with no interest from the opposite sex and when that happens it’s usually 2 weeks max before they leave me for someone else, while I am okay at what I do at college I completely fuck myself during exams and pretty much forget how to read nevermind how to answer A level questions, I completely hate my appearance despite my only hobby being bodybuilding. I am not funny even though I try to make jokes to fit in and fail, I don’t even know who I am as a person. I fuck up pretty much everything. I have no job because of coronavirus and there are no vacancies for people my age. Our area is in the strictest lockdown in the country so even if I was able to arrange plans with people it would be illegal. 

The biggest thing I hate about myself at the moment is my fear of death and lack of willpower. 

I have always looked at the negatives in life but now I look at both and realise that there aren’t really any positives. 

I really don’t know how to convince myself that being alive is the best option even though I know it is the only option - while I have pretty much constant suicidal thoughts, like I said my fear of death makes it so I am certain I won’t attempt anything.

I feel so trapped and helpless, I’ve spent half of my life waiting for the next stage and it just gets worse instead of better. 

I feel like when I get into university I’ll be a lot better but I’m really doubting that I’ll be able to do that at the moment and even then I have 11 months of this shit (not just college, everything) until I get there. 

I want a new life and I feel like university will bring that but the life I have at the moment is fucking tearing me down so much that I don’t know how I will get to that next stage.",21Sep2020,1
141,"Hey guys I have never posted on Reddit and if I have I don't remember it. I really don't know how to navigate the site but I am not really sure what to do at this point. My life has taken a turn for the worst in the past 6 to 8 months. To be honest I honestly can't remember time for me doesn't feel real anymore and I'm not sure what day or a lot of times even if it's 20/20 anymore. I have been in and out of therapy my whole life but I am pretty sure at this point I am actually starting to get worse. I have not had any medical care since I lost my health insurance after turning 26 in May. For about 2 years I was on Seroquel but got off of it when my health insurance ran out.

I know I sound dumb and like a child most times but I genuinely don't really care about what happens anymore about myself. I have been feeling this way for a while now and it's just gotten worse and now I genuinely feel like I am losing touch with reality. I have a fiance and we fight constantly. Apparently when we fight he says things to me that I make up in my head. I never even realized that I did this I know I've always been a paranoid person but he has pointed out several times where I heard him say something that simply he did not say or somebody else said something to me that they did not say.

I'm almost positive at this point they are hallucinations they are so real to me and nothing can convince me that somebody did not say what I heard them say in my head. It's literally driving me crazy I feel so alone because I feel like everybody is out to get me. I literally have no friends because I feel like I can't trust anybody I genuinely don't want to feel like this anymore but I don't know how to. I haven't left my house for anything but just to go to my parents for Sunday dinner on Sunday. And it's been like this now for about 8 months. I'm honestly scared because I just constantly hear my head telling me to kill myself. And that it should be over there's nothing left to be here for and that it's just too much. I'm either in the state of panic or in a state of just not being able to function. Like everything is so overwhelming that I just sit there and I can't talk or anything. I just want help at this point all the doctors I'm going to just tell me that I'm depressed and then put me on depression medication that makes me more manic. I've never actually thought about ending it until now because I can't live like this anymore I'm so sick of it and I feel so alone.

I'm sorry for the long post I just really don't know where to turn for help. I was going to a psychiatrist but then they moved everything to phone and I never was able to tell them about the hallucinations or anything. It's really hard for me to talk about because in my head it really is real it's there and it just frustrates me when somebody tries to tell me that it's not. I feel like my brain is telling me to end it because I just can't do this anymore and I don't know how to ask for help anymore. I don't think therapy is going to work I feel like everything is just too far gone. I should also add that after I get into the states I am unreachable. Yesterday I tried to slice my throat and I don't remember it I woke up this morning with bruises all over my arms because apparently I bit the The crap out of them when we were fighting last night. And my face is all black and blue because apparently I hit my head against the wall hard multiple times. I'm genuinely scared for me and other people around me and I don't know what to do anymore somebody please help me.

I don't know if this helps but I'm in the upstate area of New York I really don't care about any of this covid stuff I would rather die of covid at this point I'm sure none of it could be worse than what's actually happening right now. And please I'm sorry if I sound ignorant I'm in a really really bad state right now and I don't know what to do.",21Sep2020,1
142,"My gf and I were in a bad living situation with my mom for about a year until it came to a boiling point late June. We packed up all of our belongings in 4 days and moved across the country. Id never moved out of my mom's house, never lived out of the state I was born in, etc. It was really disturbing and stressful for me to leave everything I've ever known behind in 4 days. 
Almost within two weeks of arriving at my gf's parent's house, where we would be staying until we found our own place, my gf had first episode of psychosis. This was very very upsetting for me to see her go through as she is/was the only constant with me during the move and being up here. Everything else is very new to me, and when she had the episode even she changed. She almost deliberately crashed the car with us in it and I had to stay alone with her parents that hate me while she was in the hospital. I was totally alone in an unfamiliar place with people that severely dislike me, trying to cope with the fact that only thing keeping me from panicking was now incapacitated.

Sometimes I get vivid flashbacks to seeing her scream and try to struggle out of restraints in the ambulance, the look in her eyes, the way she almost killed us, etc. I had a really bad flashback on the night of September 12th and I have been having severe panic every day since. I can't function, I am just in hysterics all day. Nothing can calm me down. 

I don't know what to do to help myself. I'm so preoccupied with trying to take care of her now that she's home, even though she can do it on her own I'm so paranoid that it'll happen again that I'm...babying her on accident?

144,"Have you ever had that ‘epiphany’ where you’re like “alright time to cut the shit and get/do better?” 
So I’ve had that thought a few times within the past 3yrs, and each time it’s followed a somewhat traumatic experience. 
Long story short: each of these events unfolded because there were two common denominators... alcohol, and my mental health. I’m writing this because I had another one of said events recently.

I figured I’d share this for any one else who feels similarly and/or for support. I’m definitely an alcoholic but don’t consider it as I’m fresh out of college, but one thing I’ve noticed is that whenever the anxiety/depression increases my alcohol intake increases...thus leading to shitty situations/events. The same goes for when I feel ‘hypomanic’ (I say this because I’ve yet to have an official diagnosis but am taking prescribed a medicine for this). Each time these drunken episodes occur, I end up in an awful situation and/or threaten suicide and am close to going through with it....
Anyways I’ve realized this shit cannot keep going on, I’m worsening my current depression, PTSD, and anxiety along with hurting relationships and trust.

It’s time for change. 
It’s time to finally get a therapist instead of just having a psych to prescribe meds and give me official diagnosis’s. 
It’s time to take this shit seriously. 
It’s time I got this off my chest,
and it’s time for whoever reading this that can remotely relate to consider joining me on a journey to feeling and acting better.

I hope I’m not alone in feeling this way because the anxiety and self-guilt is eating away at my sanity. Also I’d greatly appreciate any support and any considerations of starting a small support group with daily inspiration/reminders and venting if anyone’s interested.

I’m sure many of you have felt similarly to me - not wanting to be alive but also not wanting to die. Everything is just too much right now and I don’t know how long I can do this for. I don’t want to tell anyone irl about my passive suicidal ideation because I don’t want to scare them.

Recently my grandpa, who means the world to me, got diagnosed with cancer. It’s been tough. Really really tough. I have never dealt with a loved one getting seriously ill or dying before, and I never imagined it to be this difficult. My heart hurts as if I’m going through a break up, and I fee physically sick a lot. 

This has affected every area of my life. Everything is harder and seems worse. My self-esteem is worse than before, my body image, my ability to do things, my relationship. My boyfriend is pretty good at understanding my needs, but I really struggle to be honest with him and recently I have been really anxious around him. I think it’s mainly because I think I do everything “wrong”. But I can’t tell anymore. I just have such little motivation and I feel like I have been a horrible girlfriend, and a bad person in general.

Anyways, there is too much on my mind right now and I can’t take it anymore. I called the Samaritans but the guy made me feel a lot worse (I mainly talked about the cancer and mentioned on the side that it affected my self-esteem and relationship, and the guy said “so you feel like your boyfriend has given up on you.” And i was like what? Well should I feel that way?)

If anyone actually read this, thank you, and I’m sorry for my somewhat long rant. Cancer really fucking sucks and I’m so mad that my lovely grandpa is having to go through this.

152," I want to talk about this because it feels very isolating and I feel like I'm the only person who experienced this and it feels good to express it.
 So a few months ago I experienced what my doctor said was derealization. To me, it felt like a neurological issue though.
 I hadn't been feeling like myself for a while. One day, I went out with one of my friends and as I was walking I started feeling very dizzy, tired and generally out of it.  I thought I was sick or something like that I even thought I had called the coronavirus. As we were walking I started feeling extremely out of it and Daisy and I also felt as if I couldn't control the muscles in my head and ask if my head was moving without me moving it if that makes sense. I was also really nauseous and everything felt as if I was living in a nightmare. I was convinced that something terrible was about to happen but it felt very different from a panic attack and I've had tons of panic attacks in my life. I thought I was seriously ill and that I need to go to a neurologist because I thought I had epilepsy or something.  I have to sit down. 
  When I went home I was still feeling this way and I was so scared and had to call people on the phone because I felt so stared and everything felt like it was a nightmare with physical symptoms on top of everything.
  Long story short, this lasted for about a week and another day I experienced it very intensely and I felt as if things were moving extremely fast and I have totally lost connection with the world I new something was wrong I just couldn't control it. If I haven't visited my psychiatrist who is also a neurologist, I would have never guessed that this is was derealization felt like. I thought it was a lot more subtle than that. I had tunnel vision and felt like I was in a claustrophobic bubble the whole time. It was TERRIBLE and terrifying.

I want to do stuff but then there's school and I stress out at the mere mention of that. I guess I have such a huge superiority complex or something and these are just first-world problems and then my mum mentioned something personal to her and told me to ""keep studying"" and it made me feel SO bad so I just cried. and my dad always says ""it's ok to cry to relieve yourself or whatever but not if you don't have a reason"" and he went back and forth from saying ""it's ok to cry sometimes"" to ""you're being pathetic"" and ""stop crying"" and adjskdfl like the reason I was crying was because what my mum said made me emotional and ALSO the internal stuff I have in my mimd but they don't know about that obviously so that's fair... but then that's another thing, I feel like if I were to ever get the break from school that I want, I have to divulge everything that's bothering me to SO many people: my mum, my dad, people at school like teachers and everything. my dad tells me he wants what's best for me and for me to be happy but idk. what's best for me or what he thinks is best for me? idk, when I say a break from school, he says ""oh like a month? two months?"" and I say ""no a year and I don't even know how long people who take breaks from school do so for but to be honest if I were to have one, would I ever go back, realistically? if I did take a break from school, it would be so much time to just find something else and UGH thinking about me thinking ""I won't need school eventually"" makes me feel like such a pathetic little spoilt brat. its just exhausting and I hate this. my mind is constantly at work because of what could be ocd so then I have more work and!! wow!!!! please stop!!!!!!! and I feel guilty talking about me possibly having mental illnesses like ocd or social anxiety because I haven't been diagnosed with them!!!! like it's likely that I do because of stuff but!!! yeah!!!!!!

I have had these things happen to me for a while. Also I wanted to stab my dad once. But I never do the things I think about, thanks to my self control, but I'm afraid that one day I won't be able to control myself and I will really hurt someone.

I don't really want to talk about this to my family, because I don't want them to think of me as a crazy person, but I want to get a bit of help.",21Sep2020,1
161,"My friend attempted suicide last Tuesday, and was admitted to a mental hospital, she basically helped me through a lot of shit and it feels like she is basically dead. I have been trying to call her for the past 5 days and still, she doesn't pick up. I know they take your phone away for IN my fucking opinion dumbass legal reasons, but I don't get why they don't allow her to talk to me. On her way to the hospital while she was overdosing she asked to talk to me, that's the first thing she said, so do I think that she doesn't want to talk to me hell no, the hospital is forcing her not to talk to me.

I find that extremely bullshit because your forcing someone to feel like they literally are more isolated then they are, if you have an S/O and you get admitted to a mental facility wouldn't you feel like shit if you can't talk to them at ALL. IN this particular case, having access to a cellphone would be a hella of a lot more helpful than not having one. 

Enough with my rant, is there any way I can find what hospital she is admitted to and actually talk to her or am I just forced to assume she is okay, and not you know fucking dead. Or she can be there for her entire life I don't fucking know I just ask the questions what's the benefit of keeping me in the dark.",21Sep2020,1
162,"I have weird things I do I mean it's pretty bad.

I get extremely obsessed with stuff for a little while completely looss interest and quickly move onto something else. Like I was obsessed with RDJ then suddenly got bored moved onto another person, got bored moved onto another person.

I have an obsession with horrible people. I got into an obsession of Ted Bundy that lasted like a month,  I collected 90 photos of him just to look at, I watched all the videos of him and basically drooled over him. 

Now its fucking Jeffrey Epstein, I've watched everything on him basically,  and have memorized his court speech and say it randomly, when I watched the documentary what was on my mind was how nice his looks and voice were not what he did, that's all I cared about and I've had creepy thoughts about him being my teacher. 

I like to watch gore for no other reason than I just feel interested in watching it. 

I cry over stupid things, yesterday I was in tears because my mum was getting a new couch. I'm attached to a fucking couch. 

I get very angry over nothing, I was stressed over the couch so my mum wrote some of my maths for me and she didn't do it perfectly so I went into the bedroom and flung the paintings of the wall then cried. 

I love talking to my teachers over the students, I find them nicer to me and more interesting. 

I've self harmed over nothing.

I've been groomed many times, one time has been so traumatic that I just think about it every day and feel upset and feel awful. Any mention of something related like even the country they are from to the person who groomed me I feel like crying. 

I am a mega procrastinater, due to me being obsessed with stupid things. I left 2 weeks worth of maths for the day before it was due because I was too stuck into watching Jeffrey videos. 

I feel like a horrible person who finds it funny watching gore sometimes and gets obsessions with people I shouldn't.",21Sep2020,1
163,"Lately I am feeling stuck. I have been having a lot of embarassing issues for a long time and mentally I can not take it anymore as the problems just keep getting worse. I have been diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder as a teen, but I do not fully agree with the diagnosis. The thing is that mentally I may HAVE the symptoms of BDD, but the problem is that none of my issues are imagined and I honestly only feel suicidal about the things that truly make me unattracrive wether I wanna admit it or not. At the age of 16/17 I started devloping my bad body image, but only because at that time I found out my testosterone was already low-average which isn't normal for that age and I URGED for TRT and no doctor would give it. As a result I kept worrying about my development and my ""manliness"" kinda.. I didn' have gains in the gym, felt weak and tired, socially anxious, depressed, etc. I knew my testosterone levels where at least part of the problem. But besides that I messed up WAY worse. I messed up by trying to increase my penis size trough jelqing. Jelqing is a technique where you kinda squeeze the penis and over time it should slowly increase bloodflow and size. But these are not safe and I found out the hard way. I didn't have many issues and just kept going as I felt it could only help. But over the next couple months at some point I developed weird symptoms.. sharp pains, numbness, change of shape and eventually even change of size. But right about when I started getting these symptoms I stopped the jelqing, but it was already too late. It was the months AFTER that I developed a lot of scar tissue inside. I did everything over the years to try and improve my situation. Fast forward to 26 I am now on MY OWN protocol of testosterone replacement theraphy, as my levels where genuinely low at 25 but the doctor STILL refused to perscribe and just told me to change my lifestyle while I have been trying that for YEARS with no positive effects. So I was done and now I just buy it illegally myself. It DID make me feel a lot better and I kinda made a body transformation since then and now I finally start liking or at least accepting myself for the most part. I am balding very bad, but I can deal with it. I am not really handsome, but I am 6'4"" and now in great shape since the testosterone and working out. But the penile issues are STILL continuing to get worse. I only.wear sweatpants, avoid jerking off most of the time, take cialis, pentox, l citrulline, but it is too late and the inflammation never seemed to go away. So from 17 all the way down to today at 26 my penis has been inflammed abd getting progressively more deformed over time. Now I feel like I am stuck inside a cruel joke of a life where I finally look good and accept myself, but now I literally cant have satisfying sex anymore. I am getting extremely anxious about never finding a partner, but even MORE anxious about finding a partner that finally accepts me but not being happy anyway cause I can't have proper sex. I wish the inflammation would just go. I may be able to accept the loss of volume and numbness and change in texture and all that if it would at least remain stable for the remainder of my life, but it actually still hurts and gets worse no matter how I try to get better. My urologist can't do anything... lately I am feeling old, afraid this will only get worse and I feel myself turning into a bitter and angry person no matter what I try to do. Last couple of weeks for the first time in my life I think I been crying multiple times a day every single day. Suicide is on my mind 24/7, but it feels like I can not die without ever living. The only hope I desperate cling to is that maybe one day there will be some magic cure to actually ""revive"" parts of my penis, but it seems that is WAY in the future. But for some reason I almost feel like I rather live on, get fixed at like 80 years old, have sex with a beautifull hooker one time and then maybe I can die a little more peacefull. But I doubt it... I mostly feel horrible.about all the missed experiences and the loneliness. I can't help but feel like isolating myself as the sensation of your penis slowly breaking down is something that zapps all the energy from you. I am at a point now where I start getting paranoid cause I can feel my bulge has basically dissapeared and it leaves me feeling extremely weak and embarassed as a result even when I do activities totally unrelated to sex. This messed with me so hard that I just can not see a future going further like this. I realize that the next 5 years will probably be the same as the last 5 years except now my penis will be in even WORSE condition later on. I wish I was able to deal with this, but I'm really not. I would almost consider quitting testosterone to lower libido, but the drawback is that I will still crave love and female attention and I will have to deal with low T issues possibly making me even less motivated and energized. I feel like I am stuck and at this point the only thing keeping me going is the thought of not wanting to die like this and hoping to fix myself one day. But it turned into anger and frustration. Lately I smoke a lot of weed to calm me down but now I have developed an even bigger dependency on it than when I only.smoked a little. The stress is just building up. As a result I became extremely toxic and angry with social workers, doctors, my family, etc. I just feel.like I am stuck here and nobody is gonna help me and I an left in the dark. I often direct my anger towards the people around me and lately scream and cry and I switch from wanting to kill people (I dont want to actually do it but it is the emotion that fills me), wanting to kill myself, then angry again and like I WANNA LIVE I DO NOT WANT TO DIE. Then realizing death is the only solution again. And this cycle continues on and as a result I have fits of rage, crying spells and just odd behavious cause it feels like I am already dead and nothing I do matters anymore so I just flip out. What the hell should I do?? I know I should learn to control my emotions, but I truly can not live like this anymore. Realistically speaking I can only think of a couple of solutions which would be to either fix my penis, MAYBE be able to work around the issue and find a decent girl to love me nonetheless and be somewhat haply about at least not being alone, or actually commiting suicide cause I also feel like I will never feel satisfied even with a partner if I can not have sex anymore. So now I am hellbend on either shutting down the urges inside my brain aka shut it down or healing my penile issues so I can FINALLY stop surpressing my sexual urges. I know I might still never get an AMAZING sexlife. But th thought of NEVER getting laid again scares the hell out of me. The fact I am now somewhat attractive in many ways but I am afraid of having to tell girls I grow attached to and likely can't work around this without risking humiliation I am stuck. I just wish I could try and date around again without having to worry about getting denied later on cause of this.",21Sep2020,1

166,"Hey everyone, I'm Richie, 25M from the UK, and I've struggled with binge eating since I was 19.

I didn't fully realise about my binge eating until a day in October two years ago when I ate 10,271 calories in 21 hours.

I decided to film myself talking about this because we have A LOT of work to do to tackle the stigma men feel around Binge Eating:  
[https://youtu.be/LQN2rI8i1CM](https://youtu.be/LQN2rI8i1CM)

I've typed out some more context below as well.

If you're a guy needing support with Binge Eating, please do drop me a message: I'm here for you and we have a men's support group going with 35 of us sharing our stories 💪

Sending love to you all.  


\--------------------

*I felt I was living a double life.*  
*From the outside it looked good: I'd graduated from Cambridge, I'd started a company the year before, I was sociable at parties.*  
*On the inside, I felt like a failure and felt like my life wasn't going anywhere.*

*As men, we don't learn about eating disorders.*

* *From society, we hear that ""guys don't have eating disorders, only women do"".*
* *From our own brains, we tell ourselves ""it's not manly, it's shameful"".*
* *From our well-meaning friends, we hear ""you're fine mate, everyone eats a lot, don't make a big deal of it"".*

*Luckily, I've had CBT therapy in the last 18 months and am doing well now.*

*But I know how difficult it is for us men who binge eat.*  
*We firstly need to be aware that this exists as a condition and we then need to be able to admit to ourselves that we are struggling.*  
*Only then can we get the help we need.*

*So the stigma and the shame needs to change.*

*My mission is to make it easier for guys like me — and maybe if you're reading this, guys like you — to get the help we need to tackle binge eating.*",21Sep2020,1
167,"So I’m finding myself basing my worth on test scores lately. 
I just received my SAT score, and it’s not as good as I wanted it to be. Now I just feel stupid, and I’m worried no good university is going to accept me because of my not-stellar score. 
I do exceptionally well in school, but does that even matter if my test scores aren’t good?
I don’t know how to feel. Am I worth anything if I don’t do really well on a test or two?
I just don’t know.

168,"I have always had violent thoughts but it's getting out of hand. I might kill someone if i get into a fight. I've started skipping school a lot so i don't get into a random fight, i might potentially kill someone.  I'm also extremely mentally exhausted from school, i never liked school and only went there to see my friends. I barely tried and got passable grades but shit is getting tougher and i need to put effort, but i will come out absolutely dead inside if i sacrifice my mental well-being for school.

What can i do?, my friends keep wondering where i am and i feel guilty. My boxing helped me cope with the violence but it's shut down, it was my drug and now it's gone. It's been 30 days of school and I've only went 7-8. Shit is going downhill fast and I'm lost.

What do i do? i need a fucking break right now, school has just imprisoned me, every creative thought i have is fading because of school. One more year and i can dropout but i know for a fact i wont last one more year.

the fuck do i do?",21Sep2020,1
169,"A little warning and a backstory before that. First of all, sorry for grammar mistakes, English isn't my first language. 
Now the backstory, since the start of 2020 (ironic) I started having alot of negativity in my life. It was so unbearable for me that I went to a therapist and she diagnosed me with depression (and other things I rather not to share now). Me and her did a lot of progress in the beginning and I was satisfied with her. But after something like 6 months I realized that we made no progress no more. I started to feel bad again and alot of the negativity came back to my life. 
Later on I asked to change therapists and she gave me a contact of a good therapist not so far from my town. I go to him for almost a month now.
Since our second meeting (the first one was just a recap of what I've been through with my old therapist), he insisted to use prescription he wrote for me. 
I'm relatively young and plan to work for the military in the future, but the thing is the military does background check on illnesses and medications. If they'll find out I use medications for my depression the chance for me to get the job are zero.
With my old therapist I stated from the beginning that I do not intent to use any medications and she gave me alternative exercises. My new therapist insists for me to use the medications and states that it's the best way for me to get back to normal. And he barely gives me alternative exercises..
Now should I just keep going to him (I do not intent to take medicine)?
Or should I just switch therapists again?
What's are your thoughts on the topic in general?",21Sep2020,1
170,"Hi! I (F19) have always been a generally very anxious person. Losing my father at a young age (seeing him unconscious) and seeing my mom very manic were things that my mind still lingers back to, till this day.

I’ve noticed something in myself lately that I haven’t noticed for almost 2 years. I’ve been having bursts on intense energy and happiness, doing very impulsive things (hookups, sneaking out, smoking a ton) and honestly spending money I shouldn’t be. Just after feeling like the best version of myself. Then, after that week or so, I feel terrible. I just get stuck in a deep depression and don’t even wanna do basic necessities like brush my teeth. And it usually goes like that until I crash and the cycle repeats.

yes, nowadays my parents are doing better but I'm traumatized of failing my studies that I've heard they may disown me if i failed miserably again (heard this since im 9 or 10 years old), hence my only coping mechanism is just being an escapist from my trauma (studies) or either occupy myself from it, now im 16 and i have my major test coming up which could determine my life and job occupation here and i grew up very anxious of this. im really struggling to cope with the fact that this is my ""future"" but my body just seems to be so tired everyday (i had an depressive episode 2 weeks ago where i laid in bed all day doing nothing but binge watch and my appetite has been volatile)

176,"It usually happens at night, and it can go one of two ways. 

The first way which is rarer feels like I've done some coke or something. My brain is popping thoughts off at a million miles per hour, I feel super creative and motivated, quite on edge, usually end up chatting in the mirror with myself (saying stuff like: look at ye, ye big weirdo eh - handsome fella tho it's gotta be said - just random stuff really) and speaking real quick.

The other more common type that i get is the same racing thoughts and restlessness, but instead of positivity I just want to run down the street naked whilst screaming at the top of my lungs. Then probably get into a fight with a moving bus or something. 

Is it just pent up emotion or indicative of something else?

179,"Hey guys. To keep a long story short, after being hospitalised after a suicide attempt in January of 2019, I was immediately diagnosed with MDD after a brief interview with a psychiatrist, and put on antidepressants. For many years I knew something was wrong in terms of my mental health, and depression seemed to fit the bill with regards to the thoughts, feelings and behaviours I was experiencing/exhibiting. I never questioned if MDD was the wrong diagnosis because the antidepressants worked wonders for the most part - I barely had suicidal thoughts anymore and daily tasks were easy to tackle, I didn’t feel physically tired anymore, etc. I also started going to therapy which helped a little bit, but the therapist was kinda whack so I’m looking for a new one right now, not really relevant but anyway. The point is, I didn’t really question anything because my functioning wasn’t impacted significantly anymore.

However, recently it came to my attention that the psychiatrist I go to is often too quick to make diagnoses, and misdiagnoses people sometimes. The case that stuck out to me was a girl who had been hospitalised like me after a suicide attempt - and same thing, after being interviewed briefly by this doctor, she was told she had MDD etc. Later, she said that she went to another psychologist and found out that she actually had BPD. 

After realising that I have a very unstable sense of self, my moods are changing constantly throughout the day, that I have unstable relationships, that I’ve had suicidal tendencies throughout the years and I lash out angrily after even a minor negative event, I can’t help but question if I’ve been misdiagnosed. However, I am against the idea of self-diagnosing so I am in no way trying to do that. I’m definitely gonna go to another psychiatrist and another therapist so they can assess me accordingly. But after doing a lot of research, I am worried that I’ve been misdiagnosed which brings me to my issue - if the antidepressants I’m on are allowing me to function relatively well, I barely have suicidal thoughts anymore and I am stable for the most part - does it really *matter* if I have been misdiagnosed? I’m not sure if any of this has made sense, but if anyone has some advice, or similar experiences, I’d really appreciate any input. Thank you if you’ve read this far :)",21Sep2020,1

181,"This is my second time posting here. I just feel the need to vent and for someone to hear me out. At least out here, no one knows me and I feel that I can speak my true feelings without being shot down nor judged.

Today was my first day back in university as a third year student (wee). I am excited but very much overwhelmed with the thought of doing my dissertation and my other school obligations. I'm worried about balancing work and my time management. I'm worried that being home here with my family for the rest of the semester is going to drive me insane.  I'm worried about doing my dissertation and in general, online learning. 

Since everything is online, I don't meet my campus friends. Recently, a friend has been giving me the cold shoulder too. She isn't as excited to hear from me as I am from her. Maybe I'm overthinking it but I feel as though I have no friends (I know I have them) but when it comes to nights like these, I feel so alone to my thoughts. I tell my boyfriend and I know he's supposed to 'fix' me but he is there to listen and it doesn't really help much. He just tells me to sleep or nap it out but I can't sleep with these thoughts swirling in my head.

A lot of bad news has been circling around me too. I found out my aunt is diagnosed with breast cancer. My dad's long time friend passed away. My grandfather had to be taken to the hospital a while ago to have surgery and some health issues regarding with his prostate. It has been a rollercoaster. This all happened in the span of 2 weeks.

While I'm social media, I feel like everyone is having the time of their lives but me. It makes me bitter, envious and annoyed. Sometimes, news reports are bad. The total cases of Miss Rona where I'm from are going up recently. Celebrities are getting the virus and people passing away. I recently was watching The Crown on Netflix (really good show about the British monarchy btw) and there's like scenes of sickness, death and funerals. Then, I worry about my own life. When and how will I go? I worry about getting sick and realize stress can make a person sick and I worry about being too stressed. It's just an endless cycle.

I want to cry but nothing comes. I keep thinking, ""why do I need to cry for?"" or ""what am I crying for?"" I squeeze and try but my eyes are dry. I just know that I'm upset.

**Breathwork**

There is emergency breathwork you can do to calm down. Once you feel overwhelmed try to extend your breath for 7 seconds and then release it for another 7 seconds. Your body goes to the parasympathetic nervous system that is responsible for the body's rest \[1\]. And your heart rate gets down. Use this in a stressful situation or if you go to sleep after the hard day.

But we need something more powerful to deal with regular stress.

There are many variations of breathwork. You may know about pranayama (yoga practice) or holotropic breathing. In general, breathwork is a process when you isolate your breath from any physical activity and do only it to push your body above previous oxygen limits.

**The Wim Hof Method**

I learned about the Wim Hof Method by watching the Joe Rogan Experience podcast \[2\]. This technique consists of three rounds. You do deep breathe for 40 times and hold it for as long as you can’t. Then you release, inhale and do one more hold for 15 seconds. That’s round one. There is even a video where Wim Hof guides you \[3\].

Laird Hamilton shared a story behind the method \[4\]. He said Wim Hof’s technique is a derivative of a Himalayan breathing technique called “Tummo”. It was developed by monks to keep their body temperature in the right condition in a cold environment.

Mister Hof says breathing is about changing chemistry.  “When you saturate cells with more oxygen then you typically need, your body stores it. And your body’s chemistry becomes alkaline. That enables control of all the body systems — immune, endocrine, lymphatic, vascular, etc.”

“Oxygen influences the body’s chemistry by balancing it in affected areas. Scientists agree with me, doing psychotherapy is not enough to reduce stress. You should also work on your chemistry” \[5\].

There are some scientific papers behind the method \[6\]. Which makes it even more interesting to try.

Hope you found this useful. Maybe I can tempt you with my newsletter about ""[Free tools that change people's lives](https://1pday.substack.com/p/coming-soon)"". I'm going to share new research, like this one, once a month.

191,"Okay so I’m gonna be honest, my life hasn’t been no where near as hard as other people’s, so I think I’m just a baby, but I have really bad problems with anxiety, and I’m not really sure where most of it comes from, but anytime someone yells at me or like makes me feel guilty, my brain immediately finds a way to turn it on to myself, but it feels like it’s not me tell me it, it’s as if someone is in my head tell me it’s my fault, and I instantly know a way to logically put it on myself, and I start to think that it’s right and that I hate myself and that I’m a shitty person, and nothing really can make me genuinely smile anymore, and I feel like it just turns into a major depression, and I constantly hate myself, but that’s about it, can anybody help me find out what is wrong with me?",21Sep2020,1

193,"Cast Away, the hit 2000 movie starring Tom Hanks reminds me of my own personal struggles with mental health. I wonder if anyone else can relate?


Life is fine. Not perfect, but in fact maybe a little better than fine; You’re a decent human being, you’ve worked hard and put in the time at a respected company, you’ve met a person you love and are planning to marry. You’re up in the clouds, so to speak.


Suddenly out of nowhere, you come crashing back down to Earth. Chaos and fear are followed by confusion and loneliness. You battle on alone, taking each day and each challenge one at a time. It’s a struggle at first and things that were once easy now prove to be difficult. You stumble at false hope, often make things worse. You can’t eat, and have issues stomaching what you do eat. You find that you talk to yourself far more than you used to. You cling on to an ever fading memory of your past life, but it’s that memory that remains your guiding light and reason to survive. You realise you need help and attempt to inform people that you’re in trouble, but the message just seems to wash away unnoticed. You decide that the best way to beat this is to go back to basics. This leads to learning things you never would have if this had this not happened, and you slowly discover new ways to tackle your problems like finding better ways to ask for help.


Somewhere along the line, after much time has passed, you plateau, you get stuck in limbo. You’ve somewhat mastered your new, trapped. mind and accept the feelings that have come with how you now live. However, deep down, you know you’re stranded; You can still feel the waves that enslave you constantly crashing in the background. You’ve learned to live with the voice in your head and have even come to see it as a friend. But chronic limbo leaves your mind exhausted and your body broken and despite the mastery, you can’t help but feel that you don’t want to carry on living in this restricted world.


But something drives you on, somehow you have to keep breathing even though there’s no reason to hope. Looking after yourself, eating well, accepting your problems and a great deal of patience gives you the ability to spot opportunity in the very thing that has been keeping you at bay. You build upon this new strength, embracing it with everything you have - believing there MUST be a way to use what the waves have offered against them so to overcome them once and for all! You brace yourself for the worst - even worse that when this all began, but you are a stronger person now and survive the leap, but at what cost? You’ve become so accustomed to your feelings that you’ve forgotten what your old life was like and have no idea if it’s even out there at all. As you drift further away from your problems but no nearer to normality a sense of clarity comes across you, you realise that while you are still alone, you’ve managed to let go of much of the past. Some small things remain, things that you reluctantly must let go of, no matter how much it hurts to say goodbye (I’m sorry Wilson!!!!)


Then comes a breakthrough, just when you’re on the brink of giving up - finally your mind and feelings can somewhat relate to the real world again! Things that you had gotten used to being difficult have become easier once more. But you’re not entirely comfortable with that - you’d grown to appreciate having to work a little harder for things, as it slows life down to an acceptable pace. Things aren’t quite the same back in the old world, and you get a sense they never will be - the world you left behind moved on without you in it. Yes there are some people that still love you and are glad to have you “back”. But they, too, know that things aren’t the same as they were - it’s not that simple! Life will still have you back, but you will have to learn, all over again, how to survive in it. You’re mind is at a crossroads and, once again, you must embrace.

194,"I had my first therapy session today! It was actually okay, I was super nervous, but the therapist was very understanding and insightful.

195,I'm so upset that this country and world is so expensive to survive in. young people living with their parents are at risk of homelessness if they are thrown out. of course there are many other situations that lead to homelessness too. it is so scary. It makes me extremely depressed to think about and hear about it. I feel so scared for people and potentially myself in the future.,21Sep2020,1
196,I'm really concerned for my friend I knew he had anger issues but I never knew it was bad. I have him pinned on google meets for fun and all of a sudden I come back to the tab with him slamming and shaking his desk and he got up and started slamming and punching the wall and guess he got so angry that he forgot to turn off the camera the teacher didn't notice then he was pacing around noticed his camera was on turned it off turned it back on and he seemed really depressed and was twitching. I never have seen him like that before and I believe he has other issues but I'm not sure. He overthinks a lot to the point where it consumes his life like a little argument that happens months ago he will still think about it and thinks we hate him! He never seeks help before and I don't think he's planning too. What do you guys think he has and how bad do you think it is? What can I do to help?,21Sep2020,1
197,"Been feeling like this for like the past month after some interpersonal issues. Feel like I’ve forgotten how it feels to smile. Only time I feel emotion is when this sudden burst of anger, regret or sadness hits me. Spent a week trying to drown myself in alcohol and still didn’t feel anything. Finally went to see a psychiatrist through video today and  idk. Just diagnosed me with depression. Hoping whatever treatment plan he comes up with works because this scares me. Just feeling completely empty, like there’s no meaning to anything or any purpose. Tried to stab myself through the heart just to feel something or escape this emptiness.",21Sep2020,1
198,"I don't know what it is, I do something and I get yelled at for what? Literally this morning I get yelled at for my dog getting loose and wanting to fight with another dog. I just got out the shower and I usually let me dog out of the restroom so he isn't just trapped in there with me while I'm getting ready, the routine is I let him out and usually my mother is downstairs with my other dog, but the door leading to that room is closed always since my dogs have a thing where they see each other and decide to fight with each other. I let my dog out, and the door is cracked as I'm walking down the stairs, he sees the other dog in our house, they get angry and my mother gets angry at me, for what, you left the door open, I was just coming downstairs and you know the routine of what happens, you close the door knowing that there is another dog in the house, than she goes off about how I didn't hear her or listen to her not to let him in, ARE YOU FUCKING OF COURSE I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD THESE DOGS FOR TWO YEARS, than I go to make the dogs food (cause that's why I was coming downstairs so he could eat), and she yells at me ""that's enough"" like wtf why you gotta tell, what did I do to piss you off this morning I literally just came down. It's like whatever I do I get yelled at for it. Situations like these where I get yelled at for no reason is what is making me question whether my home life is good or not, I feel like I'm living a white lie and that we supposedly live a good life because of our house and all the things we have yet the love isn't there. It's like I'm torn on whether I can love my mother or not, she acts so pissed off almost all the time and idk how to avoid it or what to do. My brother oh boy my fucking brother, he's something else, I fucking despise him, he makes me feel like I'm not his brother, I've always felt a disconnect from him and the love was never there, he has always been a fuck to me, many times when I was a kid he'd always hurt me, one moment I bump into him and yet he decides to punch me in the shoulder which left me with a bruise later that day, there are more cases but I'm not here to go on and on about that.      I'm just here to question my sanity, there are moments where I think about murdering everyone in my household including myself, I always push myself away from thinking like that yet the thought roams around in my head a lot then I would like it to. Literally every move I make in this house is always monitored no matter what, I make food I'm constantly being watched, I mess something up, I get yelled at, all this shit is why I'm so fucking fidgety and my household family wonders why. Someone please help me, I don't want to go down any bad paths, I'm 15 and male btw to give you an idea.

202,"Recently I'm having so much anger towards my own and suddenly my brain goes like:

""smash your had against that wall!""
""throw your hand in shattered glass!""

And I'm so confused. I never self-harmed (except for one planned and obviously failed suicide attempt but I don't really count that bc I had a goal there, not self-harming just because) and never even considered doing it (like I said, not self-harm just because/ without a goal)

Now suddenly my brain/body wants me to do this and in my worst moments I have to focus very hard to not let it happen
(for example: was sitting against a wall, focusing not to throw my head against it, lost focus for a split second and suddenly my head went back without me wanting to do that)

I just don't get it, I don't want to do that, yet I feel like I barely have control over these things and I'm scared I'll have a moment were I'll lose control again but way worse",21Sep2020,1

I don't know what to do anymore. I wish I could understand why I feel this way. I'm even beginning to wonder if I should see a doctor, as this up and down feeling has been happening so often. But the thought of getting diagnosed just makes me all the more anxious since there is such a stigma on mental illness in my family and well, everyone else in my life, that I'm afraid I'd feel more isolated and alone if they discovered I had a mental illness. None of them would look at me the same. 

At this point, it's hard to see any reason to keep staying alive.",21Sep2020,1

205,"In the past 10 years I had some strange symptoms. It’s probably a mental illness, but I‘m not sure which one.

One of the symptoms is Anxiety and intrusive thoughts. There were many moments, where I was worried to get fired, whether others are talking bad about me, whether my teachers have something against me.

The second symptom was heart pain. I think this heart pain was caused by my brain. I had the feeling, it was linked with my psyche. When I had stress, everything was ok during the day. But suddenly, when I came home, I had unbearable heart pain for 1-2 hours and afterwards the pain suddenly just stopped. I don’t have a clue what that was.

I microdosed 0.5g shrooms for the heart pain and took 200mg of Modafinil about one year. 
Then I got drug-induced psychosis.

The psychiatrists thought it’s just drug-induced, but can also be schizophrenia.

Are anxiety and heart pain, symptoms of the prodormal phase of schizophrenia? Was this all the time schizophrenia?",21Sep2020,1
206,"Anyone had the experience that you believe you have (insert mental health condition) but you don't officially ""check all the boxes"" in the criteria?

You identify strongly with the symptoms and have similar life experiences to those who do have a diagnosis.

But you can't get across the finish line and get a labelled diagnosis.

I am in that position. The reason I want a label is that it would account for my life experiences. And it would give peace of mind to me. 

I found myself in a Catch 22 situation. Many years ago I identified that Asperger's Syndrome was something that made sense of my difficulties in life. 

I worked really hard on all the deficits and I overcame it. 95% anyway.

Coping mechanisms and masking techniques have become incorporated into my personality.

So when I went for a diagnosis (no psychological help was available to me 25 years ago) they said that no signs of autism were detected. 

Even though I told them how I was previously. They didn't believe me. They had to see it on the day.

So I feel a bit pissed off about it seeing as all I wanted was peace of mind.",21Sep2020,1
207,"alright so, i just had a long conversation/fight with my dad. i've been especially closed off for about two weeks since a really hurtful incident happened. basically his girlfriend completely humiliated me till i had a panic attack, while he just sat there and did nothing. this is nothing new, happens all the time. i carried absolutely no fault but she snapped at me. like i said, this is nothing new but that day, i decided for myself that i couldn't take it anymore. i was in a very bad place already, but i was miserable after what happened. had strong suicidal thoughts again. i know this might not sound like much but to be constantly told that you're extremely selfish (even tho i try to be little to no burden), that I am lazy (i've been severely depressed for a while now, and am happy that i at least manage to get up in the morning), that i ruined their day and such things. it's not exactly uplifting. i'm slowly feeling like i'm dying in this house. i feel really uncomfortable with the people there and my childhood trauma occurred in this house. i'm just really not well. and my dad is constantly pressuring me to find work, which I am searching for but just haven't found something where i could see myself in. i have a mini job and he doesn't have to pay for me at all. but he talks to me like i'm a failure and even tho i try my best to survive, it's not enough. anyways, i got a bit lost there i'm sorry, i just wanted to give a bit more perspective.
so today we talked for a while, and also argued. he just started blaming me for a bunch of stuff. that i'm the bad guy because i don't feel comfortable opening up to him, and not accepting his help (which i do tho). basically i am at fault again. well after a lot of crying and arguing i let out a lot of my emotions and how i really feel, and i guess it ended kinda peaceful? we had these kinds of arguments/conversations before, nothing usually changes.
so now, i regret that i was vulnerable so much. and i wish i could take back all of the things i said. i do have difficulty opening up, but i have gotten better and don't usually regret it. but with my father i do. i don't have a very strong connection with my dad i might say, he was barely there when i was growing up, had an alcohol problem and anger issues. but i never felt this confused.
like, this conversation got my whole emotions and thoughts confused. i feel sorry for him. do my feelings even make any sense. i don't know how to describe but i just can't grasp any feelings or thoughts i used to have. it literally feels like, my brain got shaken up, and some things broke. i don't know which emotions or things actually even have any weight anymore, i mean they did all this time. and i wish it never happened, i feel extremely uncomfortable with him knowing all this stuff. i have talked with people about this, but i don't feel that with them. why can't i grasp anything right now? 
i just want to be away.

I have entered a period of my life where nothing really seems that interesting in the long term.

I fantasize/daydream a lot about doing all kinds of stuff which makes me feel really good but real life doesn’t feel the same. When I try to find a hobby or a career I want to pursue it feels like phases .. like I’ll be interested in something and try it for a while and just get bored and try to find something else. Life kinda just feels purposeless .. like when I was younger I used to dream about all the stuff “Older me” was gonna do when I grew up but now when I think about those things all I can feel is that it won’t even bring me ... idk happiness? Just to give an example of some types of things I think ... my older brothers have tons of stories of crazy shit that has happened to them with cops and women and parties and drugs etc, and I envy it all. I grew up on GameCube and PC and I’m a socially awkward guy and everyone supports me in my family and tells me that I’m going down the right path and stuff like that which I understand since our family has been through shit to finally become stable and I’m the first one to make it to college. While my brothers talk about wishing they’ve gone to college and finished school like I have.... I feel like I wish I have done all the crazy shit that they have. I feel like their lives have been more interesting, thrilling, and more like I guess a movie or story to tell their kids when they have them you know? Even then sometimes I think that being in their position I would just be bored with life too though because maybe I’m just trying to seek something that doesn’t exist ... like I’ve grown up too obsessed with magical powers and mythology and stuff like that from games and movies. We make all these beautiful stories and video games with supernatural stuff or insane powers and then we come back to reality and it’s just lame. I’m really sorry for being really cringe and dumb and there’s so many more important issues out there then this 😂 but yeah I just don’t really know what I should do ...

For some context, in my family I have always been seen as an attention seeker, which I probably am but this time I show almost every symptom of OCD. Also my brother has OCD as well.
Now onto the real part. 
I can’t actually remember when it started, but around puberty, but I didn’t know it at the time. It would be stuff as little as just switching the light on and off because it didn’t feel right the first time. That’s the least extreme part. The most extreme part is when I have a really distressing thought and I can’t get it out of my head. Or I will be walking and think to myself “what if I just jump in-front of that car right now?” 
If what I suspect is true, i would like to get help as I just want to feel normal again, but the main problem is getting diagnosed. Not necessarily the doctors, but my family. They will always try and downplay whatever I say and won’t really believe and just say I’m looking for attention but I honestly believe that there’s a chance I have this condition. Is there any other way of getting a diagnosis or should I just tell my family? Appreciate any help you can give me.",21Sep2020,1

220,"Around the time I went through puberty, which for me was at age 13, Id started getting really strange anxiety attacks about mundane things. I didn’t talk to anyone about it, taking special care to keep my parents from finding out since they’re conservatives and at the time they unfortunately didn’t understand depression or anxiety or any sort of mental illness of the like.

I suffered with it through my first two years of high school. To give an example of the intrusive thoughts I’d get, it was as if something dirty was trying to attach itself to me. I didn’t touch any desks with my bare hands, and I didn’t look at anyone because another thought was that I would stop looking like myself and my face would take their shape. I spent alot of time staring at the floor as I walked around and likely looked like a weirdo since Id often whisper to myself to calm down and that I was being ridiculous.

I don’t like to talk or think about the more violent thoughts that would squirm into my head, since they have found their way back into my brain now. A lot of the time they had become so loud I couldn’t handle school, id make excuses to stay home and not leave the house. I guess my sister had observed this closely since she began asking why I hated school and avoided going out for even just a walk. She thought I was being bullied but honestly I had made myself so invisible at school that no one talked to me. It took some time but I eventually told her about my intrusive thoughts and anxiety and that I had given into self harm a couple of times that year. I owe her a lot since she was the one who confronted my parents, and talked them into talking to my primary doctor, who then convinced them into letting me see a therapist. 

Through therapy, I challenged myself to look up and be curious about the world rather than ignore it all in fear that my brain would later use it to attack me. I reconnected with some middle school friends and though it took some time I slowly got better. I started gaming, which helped keep me distracted from these thoughts.  I relied on this and the other “distractions” that I had in my life to pull me out of dark places. Whatever I was going through didn’t have a name at the time, my therapist had just told my parents I had severe anxiety. Things were fine through the end of highschool and university, which were the best years of my life. But ever since I graduated and started working, some of these thoughts have wormed their way back into my head. 

I don’t know what triggered it. It happened over the summer as I took the subway to work (I took it to uni for years and it never bothered me) and the anxiety built up again. Thankfully I relied on old breathing/mental exercises so Ive been able to somewhat control it but theyve been getting worse and worse. I’m having difficulties in having basic conversations, or watching movies/gaming or hanging out with my friends/family.  This is the new aspect of it, since I could rely on my friends or my hobbies to distract me but now the THOUGHTS are distracting me from them. The pandemic had made it oddly tamer, since I haven’t been leaving the house as often. Not really wanting to go back to therapy, I’ve just been trying to muscle through it. I researched the symptoms I’m having and found that they were pretty much identical to the symptoms reported from “Pure O OCD”. 

I’m proud of my parents for being open about mental health now, but am reminded of their worry when I first went through this. I’m living with them right now and don’t want to see them worry since COVID has already made them so nervous. I genuinely don’t want to go back to the therapist myself. Working from home helps alot but my brain seems to be starting to find new ways to torment me even in the safety of my own house. 

Do I keep muscling through it? I dont know.  Im glad that whatever this illness is, it has a name that I would want to talk to a psychologist about. The whole world feels so surreal since last summer and everything this year has just doubled down on it. I don’t feel hopeless, just really tired.",21Sep2020,1
221,"Hi, this is my first post on reddit, so I might be doing this entirely wrong. I've seen a lot of advice in reddit threads and I finally got brave enough to ask for advice myself. So, I guess I'm gonna start out by saying that I'm not super mentally ill (I have ADHD, anxiety, and some minor depression and PTSD, but nothing major. I'm really lucky compared to a lot of people.), but I'm not sure if my behavior is normal. When I'm overwhelmed or anxious, I sit on the floor in my closet. Now, my closet isn't very big, but you can walk around in it. I started doing this when things at home were unstable. I have two very loving parents who are together and happy, but for about seven ish years my home life was hell. My sister had a severe mental breakdown and started to have episodes. I'm not gonna get into detail (unless you guys want me to, I'm comfortable sharing the story) but she would have screaming fits and suicide attempts. All in all it made me feel really unsafe from the time I was 13 to about 18, and therefore my developmental years were kinda effed up. When she would have an episode, I would hide in my closet. So now, I'm kinda worried that I'm not normal, because as a 19 year old at college, whenever I'm feeling nervous or even homesick, I chill in my closet. I'm not panicking or anything in there, it's just comforting. Am I messed up? Any advice?

TL:DR I hid in my closet when I was scared as a teen, and now I do it whenever I want to feel calm. Is this normal?",21Sep2020,1

223,"Am I wrong for being livid my bf(m21) won’t leave my green cheek conure alone? So a little back story, I have stress induced psychosis along w other mental health issues that make it hard to control my intrusive thoughts sometimes. With being in quarantine I’ve been STRUGGLING to keep a lid on my mental health issues as my usual coping tools like going to the gym, bookstore, or to my moms to calm down is no longer an option as I’m high risk for COVID.

I love animals and caring for things helps me stay sane. The kind of bird I have usually only bonds to one person in a family and in her case it’s true when I brought her home and opened the box she immediately picked me. Everyone tries to touch her and she flies off or bites but she lets me bathe her and sleeps in my hand. With my mental illness I sometimes have thoughts of harming her and when I’m stressed the impulse become intense. When I feel jealous that she maybe loves my bf more (again this is mental illness I know the thought process isn’t one that makes sense) I become enraged when she shows anything but aggression towards him and feel betrayed. When I’m feeling this way I just leave her alone, she hasn’t done anything and I don’t want to even risk actually doing the things I think. 

I’ve never in my life actually harmed an animal and these intrusive thoughts aren’t new but with the state of the world I’m extremely fragile. I’m afraid I could take all my emotion out on this innocent lil birdy so my temporary solution (until I can talk to my drs and therapist to figure out how to cope) was to ask my bf to just not interact w her at all so I won’t be triggered. I have told him exactly what my intrusive thoughts are and how it hurts my soul that I think those things and want to make sure I leave no space to act on these feelings but he won’t leave her alone!! He picks her up, pets her, feeds her treats, and talks to her which of course because I’m distant its making her prefer my bf more and more.

Yesterday she bit me for the first time since I started training her. I yelled at my bf about how he doesn’t care about my mental health or my birds health and why can’t he just leave her alone she’s never neglected or mis cared for so it’s not like he’s stepping in to help he just wants to play w her despite my very real fear I could hurt her. With that I’m thinking about rehoming her for her safety. My bf has showed he won’t use an ounce of self control about playing with her and I don’t think theres any other options. 

My boyfriend says that I’m just getting rid of her like her previous owners and that I made a commitment to her for her life and breaking it will just traumatize her. I think he doesn’t take me seriously because I am very good at hiding the crazy shit going on in my head and he doesn’t really think I’d do it but I am not so sure.",21Sep2020,1
225,"I just talked to my therapist about how my depression and anxiety has been increasingly worse. I just turned 18 and recently started therapy for the first time, for context. She said that I should probably try out medication and it would take 4-6 weeks to start working. I’ve never been medicated before, what will it feel like? Will I feel worse at first?

This year my dad and nan passed away 2 months between each other and bf of 2 years left me. 
Despite all this and strange time of coronavirus I've managed to finish my undergraduate degree. I am actually proud of myself for achieving something and not dropping out. At school I couldn't see a future or my worth at all but I know I need to keep working at it. I need to keep working on myself to become better.",21Sep2020,1
228,"I haven't been talking or texting anyone lately. The only reasons I do though are as last resorts when my mental health is low and I am in a dark place.

My friend recently said that I've been treating her like a personal therapist.

I realized that I am anxious to talk to my friend on a regular basis, but when I talk to her, I am afraid that I am almost always on the verge of a mental breakdown like how I once ran away from my house (I'm a high school student). I had some trauma in which this friend bullied me before, but we became friends again although she never fully apologized for socially isolating me. She also told me recently that she didn't think I ever liked her anyway since we became friends after the bullying incident. The one time I talked to her about my problems in that time was when I would talk to her about my parents divorcing, but she didn't really feel it mattered. Though, I started asking her more about why she bullied me years ago, and I grew to trust her again to talk about trauma or challenges since quarantine. Though, I have social anxiety of reaching out for social connection, so I don't talk to her as much about topics she likes. Overall, my friend thinks our friendship has gone stale and that I am toxic. I wish I could find a balance between getting enough mental support and not burdening my friends. 

I feel like a bad person, but I try to tell myself thay no person is truly bad if they try to improve themselves. That's what I hope to do :)",21Sep2020,1
229,"	Please whatever you do, do not ever go to the Florida Assertive Community Treatment Team, an outpatient mental health program. Although they helped me find a place to live. However, it came at a cost. Today I spoke to my Case Manager here's how it went. \[It is kind of long\]

I told him I had some concerns I would like to address. The first thing I asked for is a copy of my lease because I rushed while signing it and I was unsure what was in it. The second thing I asked for is a reason as to why I am responsible for paying the whole house 3 bedrooms 1 bath worth's of rent when I am only renting one room and not allowed any guest or roommates over. I told him that the last tenant told me she didn't have to pay the whole house worth's of rent. My CM told me it was not true and began to explain that the tenant did pay the totality of rent. He then passed me to his supervisor.

		 The health care administrator who works in that office told me she would discharge me from the program, effective today, and I would have to find a new place to live even though that is not how the FACT team really works. She was just trying to bully me into leaving a program that pays part of my rent. I was not going to let that happen. She then told me I was responsible for paying the utility or they would discharge me. To that I told her that I already paid the utility bill (even though it is not under my name).

This is where things got ugly. she then stated, ""Then why are you calling bitching about it?"" . I told her she needed to act as the professional she was hired to be. I replicated her attitude. I told her everything that was on my mind. She hung up so I called back. Then she kept hanging up each time. 

		I filed two reports with civil rights and the MHRCF. I described to them the way in which the health care administrator has conducted herself from the first time I had a problem with her. She has stated in the past that I was ""looking for attention,"" when I tried to get the office to relay a message to the doctor to please adjust my medicine because I was not feeling well. This later in the same month led to my hospitalization.

		Also, I told them about her racist remark towards me in June 2020 "" Did you learn all your letters in Haiti yet?""  ""I know you, you're a trouble maker,"" and ""Go to the streets. Do it right now!"" Last but not least ""I will Baker Act you!"" A statement she made 12 times because she felt like she was ""going in circles"" with our conversation. Even though it is illegal for one to placed under Baker Act when they don't meet the criteria.

	I am still awaiting civil rights as I filed online but as for MHRCF they contacted her supervisor right away. Just do me a favor and make sure you never end up in my position-wanting to leave because of bullying and discrimination, but not leaving because the bully would win.",21Sep2020,1

235,"Heyo

So I’ve decided I want to give therapy another try.  

For context I am an 18 year old female, I’ve only been to therapy for 3 weeks at the beginning of this year until covid closed my college.

I had the opportunity to move things online but I decided not to at the time.

Ideally I would like to receive diagnoses, medication, and talk therapy all together. Can I do that all with one person or will I need several people?

Also how does online therapy compare to in person? Would you say it is better or worse? Any pros and cons would be great information. (Also tips for doing online therapy in a small house would be great).

Finally I was wondering how I would ask my dad about all this. Earlier in the year he offered to get me therapy after all the things he did when I was a child (he had undiagnosed/now diagnosed ptsd for much of my childhood along with being an alcoholic). 

I am not really good at conveying my emotions to other people though I really can’t avoid such a topic when asking for therapy. I’ve been suspicious that I have depression, aspergers, and c-ptsd (to name the most likely candidates). I’ve self harmed for years (nothing major though) and have been suicidal since I was ~11.

I don’t really know how to bring this up to my dad though, I know he will probably let me get therapy regardless I am just not used to the idea of opening myself up like this, especially to him (he was very militaristic when I was a kid and emotions were usually seen as a bad things).

Any advice or personal experiences you guys can share would be greatly appreciated.

239,"i cant really put anything into words right now. i recently was very guilty and am now very angry but all throughout my mind is remaining cloudy and i cant think straight. It might be bcause of my sleep deprivation



because of this i just cant be bothered and enjoy the things (watching shows/reading books/playing games) and hobbies i used to do (piano/art). i havent had much to talk to except a word document, since my parents arent that supportive.

all my problems have been stagnating and becoming cloudier after i bottle them up- i dont deny this. I tend to do this with all my emotions except anger and sadness at home

my mum avoids speaking to me about serious topics nowadays because she fears for it devolving into an argument. she is pretty tired throughout the day and i dont know hy tbh, she works above normal hours but doesnt do night shifts. My mum either says that shes too tired to speak or doesnt want an argument. And what the fuck am i meant to do then? I remember i think it was some time last year when she said people at my age then (15) dont get any serious depression and dont have serious mental issues unless they are a genetic trait. So i assume i cant speak to her about that.

There does exist some sort of language barrier between me and my dad as he cant understand full english. When i talk about my problems with my family, he always says that i just need to listen to them and everything will be alright. One time when my sister and i got into a fight, he immediately supported my sister. Today, i got extremely mad at my mum and he immediately supported her. There seems to be a pattern.

My mum and my sister have said some horrid stuff to me, although mostly in our parents’ native language. My sister did say a couple of times a while back to me to kill myself, which didnt really help at that time seeming as though i was thinking a lot about death around that time. My mum gives me threats in the other language but when i asked her when she was calm and cool, she just said its how she was raised up???? What the fuck i dont want third world parenting in a developed country mum.

On the other hand, my mum does have another side somehow that is pretty much the opposite, where she treats me very nicely. 

Throughout the entire lockdown i reckon, excep for some gatherings i spoke to around 3 people. I started lockdown by just snacking on bars of dark chocolate and noticed i gained weight. Now however, ive lost that weight and even more. Anyway, i felt so empty.

I shouldnt forget to mention my sleep problems caused by chronic procrastination. 

Im generally afraid for my own future, because the way i used to see it a few years back was ambitious and clear, however now ive lost all my ambition and dreams and passions. 

All i do is waste my time on reddit. 

I wish more people at school talked to me, as they are all pretty friendly, but they just have an amount of energy i just cant match to fit in. 

I tried talking to some people online, but every single time, there seemed like there was some barrier between us- like for example i was talking to a person about life and then the conversation devolved into politics and how our native countries have conflict.Another one of my longest term friends recently left the religion that i follow, (please dont hate on me being a religious person reddit) and the festivals every year and going to the prayer place was generally the main times we ever met. Now its not like we cant be friends anymore, its just that just like other friends of mine, we are becoming more distant. Another one of my longest term friends moved  away a couple of years ago and although i have moved on a long time ago, it just shows how im becoming distant with everyone. And THE closest friend i have talks to me much less and shares barely any interests anymore. Things wouldnt be so much of a problem if i was getting closer to someone or some people.

barring reddit, i dont use social media that much anymore

The main things keeping me from wanting everything to end is :

me wanting to have kids who i can give a great life and be the best father i could be

my fear of god [again, please dont shit on me reddit :(   ]

me being able to make mends with everyone and seeing if i could be successful. My parents used to say i have a bright future but now they say you need to quickly decide on your future. I used to have this nursery or reception teacher that , when i was leaving for a different one, said to my dad that “whereever he (me, u/safinhh) goes, he will be able to fit in”. My dad quotes this and tends to this memory like its a damn prophecy

243,"So, I have high-functioning Asperger's and although I have never been diagnosed with either, I strongly believe I have mild depression and moderate social anxiety, although when it gets to tough times of year for me, my depression can get to the point where I lose motivation to eat for a day or two although I still get up for, and go to work, still look after myself in terms of appearance and hygiene and I still get things done but since that lack of motivation to eat only lasts at most 2 days, I wouldn't say there'd be any problems. 

Although I have been suicidal, driven to alcohol (mostly to combat the insomnia from my Asperger's which, yeah I know isn't a good idea, but I don't drink anymore and my insomnia is still there but nowhere near as bad as it was) and having the lack of motivation to leave my bed in the past, about 3-4 years ago was my worst, that was due to what I had going on at the time, which was a hell of a lot (3 family deaths, failing my degree, losing my main group of friends at that time due to romantic reasons with one of the friends).

People keep saying that I should see a doctor and get officially diagnosed with the depression and anxiety either to organise a psychologist or be put on medication. 

My reasoning behind not wanting to get diagnosed is, I feel it'll go one of 3 ways if I am diagnosed:-

- They recommend me to a psychologist or whatever who will basically get me to just question every decision I make asking ""why I did this?"", ""why I didn't do that?"" And ""what were my thought processes at the time?"" Which I do anyway since I have a very philosophical mind from my Asperger's and I like to question things throughout my life, so I'd see that as pointless.

- They put me on anti-depressants or whatever other drugs but I wouldn't want this because, I'd have thought this would basically numb me emotionally. The reason I wouldn't like this is I love emotional music and films and I'd still want to be able to get emotionally invested in such things but from my college-level understanding of biology and chemistry, all I'd guess anti-depressants would do is force releases of serotonin and dopamine to force your brain to be happy, which I wouldn't want due to a lot of things I enjoy being linked to my sadness like film and music.

- They decide I do have it but not strong enough to do anything about and so then it's just something on my medical record that I have, which seems pointless to me.

Because the only way in which I'd say it is currently impacting my life externally is when my family is worrying about me not eating for a couple of days at the the tough times of year. Should I stick to not getting diagnosed with either or should I actually do something about it? Thanks",21Sep2020,1

Okay, so over the past few days my brother has been saying really racist, homophobic, etc stuff about literally everyone and everything and each time he opens his mouth, I want to punch him or stab him so hard that he isn't able to open his mouth again. I'm not talking 'oh black people are thieves', etc, no. That's nothing compared to what he says. 

To start things off, he is autistic (he says it's aspergers but us autistics know that's a very bad diagnosis) and all the things he says he will look through it but he won't take in anything that is known to everyone and instead listens to all the little things that people literally make up (he won't read news cause apparently it's all wrong, even though it is right in the whole, the exaggerations are the issues. Instead he reads things that anyone could make up like PDF files he finds or that one website on page 6068 on Google). 

Today and two days ago was when it affected me the most. He keeps saying that feminism is evil because women are apparently stupid and they don't know anything. 

This is very minor with what I'm about to say now so please stop reading if this is bad for you.

He says that muslims are only over here to rape our little girls, that LGBT (or as he calls us 'LGTB') people are trying to overpower us or something. He says that people in prison should be given knives and stuff so they end up being able to hold a weapon in public without attempting to kill someone (he's talking about rapists and murderers here or people who've stabbed overs, etc). He fucking said that I am just a 'lady boy' or whatever cause I'm trans. He even showed me a firstnews paper (he says firstnews is full of crap, etc) and he said that a black dude is stood infront of a white dude which shows that black people are taking over, I pointed out that there's a white kid on the opposite page and he said 'oh he's an ugly ginger kid' which I'm assuming means that he thinks ginger kids are less important or whatever that white men? He then said Hitler killed Jews cause of how they look, not because their grandparents/parents/wife/husband/themselves were jews, I even looked through everywhere on the internet to find proof that Hitler sent the Jews to concentration camps because they were jews/related to jewish people and he still told me that I was wrong. He says men need to stop being obsessed with computer games and makeup because 'it lowers their testosterone levels'. He says that the UK didn't take over Africa and force slavery but rather we 'went there to help them learn to farm'. He says that Covid is just the flu when my dad literally got rushed in to hospital today over a bloody stomach bug cause of how ill he is (his extremely vulnerable). He says we don't need to wear masks because it lowers our immune system (which I agree with a bit but my dad WILL DIE if he gets the flu/covid) and in winter all our kids will die in the world cause they have weakened immune systems. He says that my dad only has a minor disease or whatever when this is the last stage now, he's gonna have a tube straight to his heart for meds 24 hours a day flowing unless he gets a double lung AND heart TRANSPLANT, he's literally going to die soon. He was given three years, it will be three years in July. 

It just fucking sucks having a brother like him. I would just rather not be alive or fucking strangle him, with my bare hands. Just fucking jump out a 50 story high window or lob him into an ocean. I just can't handle this anymore. My mum won't even cut of ties with him because 'hes her son' and 'I need to see me grandchild' and I'm like that kid will literally fucking die cause he things superglue will heal everything and that plasters/bandages will be worse than playing in mud and dirt with an open wound. I can't do this anymore. I really just can't. I don't think I will be able to hold it together the next time I see him (probably tomorrow) and I might end up doing something I regret but I  can't do anything about it and it fucking sucks, okay.

I (17 yo) was abused  by my parents when i was a kid, my father was absent always, i have  daddy issues, i have issues with belonging due to the enviroment i lived  in, irealized at a young age that my mom is not a good mother and  doesnt relly love me, since then i have trust issues and very strict  rules with any relationship  
i struggle with all kinds of   relationships, dont have a family or a place to call home. I got so fed  up when the girl i love actually made me realize she has a loving  family. 17 years, and i never fell in love thinking that the girl i  think of is as good for me doesnt exist, until she actually showed up!  Since i saw her being the best person ever, with a family i lost my  interest in her, i felt so jealous. I wish to have a family, a father at  least, but this never happened. I really dont want her anymore, i feel  so jealous yet so sad because well u know how family is! it is the most  important thing ever, too bad i dont have one. I really dont know what i  should do anymore, i cant keep a friend or even the girl that made my  life better. I hate this",21Sep2020,1
251,"I know, without a single doubt, that I need help very very soon. I've had friends and family members who've had horrific experiences in publicly supported behavioral health centers and I can't do it, I'm afraid it's too risky.

However, I have been advised that an in patient facility is my best hope, but isolation is a huge part of my problem.  So, as you can imagine, complications related to Covid - no visitation, limited staffing, etc., combined with autoimmune issues (Type 1 Diabetes, Lupus, etc) have made my mental health provider wary of pushing me to admit myself. She also is not fully aware of how *nothing* I am.

And, as silly as it sounds, she and I are both resistant to separating me from my dogs and cat. They are my positive thing to hold on to.

I don't have any friends. My husband loves me, but is not a support. I can't tell my parents, as they are elderly and I CANNOT burden their brains with this. Totally out of the question, they don't deserve that. They are wonderful people.

I can't exaggerate how strongly I loathe myself - without reservation, everyone would be better without me. My existence adds nothing but stress.

I tried in-person therapy, but I just couldn't. Hard to explain, but the overall issues are that I don't deserve it and can't break away from presenting myself in a way that doesn't worry others. 

I guess I'd just like to hear advice on what alternatives are out there. Whatever source of help anyone could suggest.

252,"I genuinely think I have some kind of anxiety, I've never been to a doctor or psychiatrist for it but my symptoms seem similar enough to them to raise concern in me. The problem is I'm no good at asking. For the last couple of years, I've never asked to go to the doctor once unless I was really sickly or in physical pain. My parents have gotten used to that and I have too. I don't know how I'd even ask them.

  My family isn't very understanding of mental health. I've had my dad jokingly call my friend a ""retard"" for having depression and anxiety. Mind you, it was all in jest, sure it was insensitive, but he said it to me and not to his face. It's not that they don't believe disorders are real or anything, I just think that they don't understand exactly what they are. I also don't know if it's covered by my insurance and we aren't in the best situation to spend. So, asking them to have me checked up for something like this is very worrying to me and just scares me. 

  My mental health has been going down the drain recently after the quarantine, I think I've always had pretty bad mental health but quarantine has actually made it a problem for me. I got put into an AP-Course (a special program for college credits that smart people take) by complete mistake after asking a teacher if I could be put into honors and I can't handle it. The class is just too difficult for me, especially when compared to the rest of my classes. I haven't been able to get much work done for my classes in general since it takes a lot of effort for me to want to get out of bed, and I dread having to do work for the class since most of the questions fly over my head like a plane. I really want to drop out of it but the period for that ended, and I'm too scared of opening up and telling my counselor about this or even the teacher. 

  The worst part of it all is if don't do both of these things I'm going to face a lot of backlash for it. My teachers are going to call my parents, they'll yell at me, I won't be able to get caught up because It's genuinely too hard for me to understand, and I'll get yelled at or even grounded for something that I'm too afraid to prevent. 

I know if I asked my parents would probably understand, and my teacher would probably understand as well, but it's that ""probably"" that scares me. I don't feel comfortable asking anyone right now, im just too 'scared'. I don't even know if that's the right word for it, I just get this horrible feeling in my gut about it.

 Sorry for the wall of text though and if you read it all the way through then thanks for your endurance. 

Also, the 'retard' thing was in private and I and my parents tend to be blunt to each other and not beat around the bush so it's not that he has any resentment to disabled people or anything. He just thought it'd be funny to say something offensive I guess.

I want you to know that it's okay to be angry, disappointed, and hurt that you've found yourself down here again. let yourself feel all of that. cry it out if that works. have compassion for the part of you that's tired of this.

and offer yourself forgiveness. because the other part of you, the one that knew you should have gone to bed early but didn't, the one that chose negative self talk knowing it only makes things worse, the one that just will not get up and do those dishes? that's also your self, and they're also in pain. they know they've let you down. you don't have to keep kicking them now.

forgive. make space for what hurts. do what you can, and love yourself through it. even if that means putting on a sad song to sweep the floor just a little, even if you eat something quick, easy, and processed, even if you manage a shower but plop right back onto your bed. it's okay. you still matter. you're still worthy. you're always, always loved.

Will I likely be presided medication based off of a bipolar diagnosis or will I have to be re-evaluated before receiving treatment.

Some people are naturally more sociable and I wish I was one of them.

262,"I started shoplifting about 3 years ago. It was mostly small stuff like art supplies and misc stuff from target. Once I realized how easy it is to steal, I went all out. My former proudest accomplishment was that I’ve stolen 20 pairs of airpods from Apple stores. I know I’ve stolen well over $5k worth of various products from groceries to video games and otc drugs. I can be charged with a felony with the amount of theft I’ve done. I’ve only been confronted by a worker once and I was easily able to escape. 

Shoplifting was stress relief for me. If I felt sad or anxious, I could just go and steal shit and I’d feel better. I got addicted. Sometimes I would take stuff I don’t even need just to feel the rush of stealing it. I’m so fucking lucky I’ve never gotten in legal trouble because of it. 

About a month ago, I took some nicotine gum from target, and a loss prevention officer followed me to the door and stopped once I left the store. I don’t know why, but that was my breaking point. After that, I’m too scared to even take something small. I keep getting dreams that I get caught and shown everything I’ve ever stolen, or I set off alarm towers at a store without taking anything and being unable to run away. The dreams feel traumatic. 

Now I’m constantly paranoid. I’m scared to buy groceries, I panic whenever I get a call from an unknown caller or someone knocks at my door. I really fucked up. This is nobody’s fault but my own, and now I’m paying the psychological consequences. I don’t know how I’ll ever feel normal or comfortable again while shopping. I constantly think about how stores are building cases and want to arrest me the next time I go in, or if the police are figuring out my info so they can arrest me.

For the past 6 months I have extremely down and the only thing I’ve been using to fix it is various substances. I have started using one that is particularly bad and is rampant in my county. It worries me so much bc I already have other addictions so I can see myself getting hooked on this. I’m scared for myself honestly. I feel so selfish bc I wouldn’t mind if it took my life over or just took my life completely bc I have secretly been wanting to do so myself. I try to talk about it with the only people around me and they don’t seem to know what to do with me. It’s my mom and my bf. I tell them and they just tell me I hve to get out of this, that I just need to sleep better or eat better or something. You know, “thanks I’m cured” kinda advice. But I try. I’ve been taking meds and they help to not make me so angry but the depression is heavier now. I don’t have any motivation and not even a lot of strength to get up and do things like take a walk or mop the house. I try to remind myself why I want to get better but then I think “it’s not even worth it I’m pathetic I might as well get fucked up or die” I have a therapy appointment but I’m terrified of doing it over the phone for some reason. And even in person it’s too much for me. I’m trying to get better with saying how I feel out loud to other people but it always ends in me having an intense crying fit and whoever I’m talking to getting really annoyed. Honestly I’d prefer to go to an inpatient facility. I want to detox from this world. No phones, no drugs, no triggers, no one begging me to just hurry up and get better. I just want to feel in a safe place with people around me who understand. I want to stay there until I get better and I’m able to be in society and not get triggered into doing more drugs or just done right SHing. But I’m scared. I’m scared my mom will be mad at me or ask if I’m really “one of those crazy people”. She worked in a mental health facility and always compares my crying or breakdowns to the patients. Or my sister will judge me for not growing up and being strong like her. She had a kid young and still managed to get a license by herself and support my mom and I for 5 years. And I’m scared my bf will be embarrassed to be with a girl who was in the hospital. He has depression too but he has a “shake it off” kinda thing. I was telling him how I felt today and he told me I had to “get out of that”. So I just started crying and he... fell asleep. Or that my dad will be ashamed because he thought I was done with “these games” And I’m scared that it’ll mess up my chances of getting a good job when I’m a bit older, or any job for that matter. But I feel like I’m really close to doing something to hurt myself really bad, intentionally or accidentally. I did too much drugs the other night and my brain was fried.

The next appointment, she mostly talking about these other tests and therapy options but that we would have to meet more than once a month to do them. I’m financially pressed so I can’t do that and I tell her several times but she seems to just keep pressing it on me to try to get me to agree to come in more often. To be honest, I felt like she talked for than I did. The next appointment, I tell her that the main reason I wanted to go back to therapy was to be able to do the things I wanted/needed to do because I feel like I’ve lost the motivation to do it. She tells me to just “don’t think about it and force yourself to do it. Just do it”. Like what the fuck kind of advice is that?? I can barely convince myself to get out of bed in the morning... I know I need to and I know that I want to but I just can’t. So I guess the best advice that our trained professionals have for that is to “just do it”. Maybe she used to work for Nike? Is this real life?",21Sep2020,1
278,"i dont know how much longer i can continue. of course 2020 has been horrible in general but ive had a bad case if covid that wound up with me being rushed to hospital, i came out of my first shift back after lockdown to 5 guys trying to hijack my motorbike  (was 11pm, i was alone and female), to having to pay for repairs, to someone trying to steal it again a week later (parked elsewhere), im being bullied/picked on by my manager and another staff member, got hit by a car on my motorbike, got told at work i was lying about the accident, and now ive just had to have 6 days off because a family had covid symptoms which meant i was looking after them and my 2 siblings. im now going back tomorrow to do 7 shifts in a row and i really dont know how to continue. im getting nowhere, im over 1k in debt and no matter how much i try to pay off it never drops below 1k. im so fucking stuck in a bad loop that i dont know how to get out of and i just dont see why i shoukd try anymore when nothings going anywhere and my life is just a flaming bag of shit left on someones doorstep. idk what the point if this is i just needed to let it out somewhere but i really dont see myself making it to 2021 anymore",21Sep2020,1

280,"I thought I had myself all figured out, I've spent 5 long years alone and inside my own head contemplating life and my own psychology. I came to a conclusion, now my thought process and ideologies have all changed in the matter of day, I'm completely contradicting everything I thought I was. My soul is torn into pieces, and my consciousness only inhabit fragments of it at a time, I'm not consistent, I'm insanity incarnate.",21Sep2020,1
283,"I want it preface this by saying I’ve never seriously though about suicide before. It’s crossed my mind but was never truly an option for me. A few days ago I was at an obstacle course suspended about 20-50 feet above the ground. The only thing stopping you from falling was two hooks attached to a harness, that had to be hooked on at various point. Past the first course there was no supervision from the staff at all. I was at the back of my group, meaning I was on my own at various points (only one person was supposed to cross a section of the course at a time). On a few of these occasions I kept looking over the edge and just thinking about unhooking and jumping off. The worse part about it is that it was the thought of my friends and family being there and seeing my jump that stopped me. It was the fact that I was having a good day. The aforementioned though never even crossed my mind. I fear I’m falling to a place that I won’t be able to get back from.",21Sep2020,2
