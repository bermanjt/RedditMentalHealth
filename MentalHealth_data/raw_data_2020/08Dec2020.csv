2,"I’m a 28 year old man and, as I’ve gotten older, I’ve conditioned myself to trust nobody. I just had a surgery done, and my car failed inspection. I’ve spent the last three days on the phone with the hospital billing department and mechanic fighting and fighting. I tried recording my operation while under general anesthesia (to no avail). I spent all summer preparing a case with Unemployment that went all the way up to the Magistrate Court. In my last job, I fought my boss and HR on my income. And now, I have to get another surgery, and have caught myself harassing the doctor’s office because, why would a surgeon treat something conservatively if he/she gets paid 10x more for surgery?

I think about all the ways people try to take advantage, and try so hard not to fall victim to that. But by constantly being on guard and accusing everyone of trying to fuck me over, I’ve ruined jobs and relationships. People think I’m difficult, and my mental health is deteriorating. 

I want to trust again, and be able to let things go, but I can’t help myself, and it’s ruining my life. I’m so tired, and I feel like it’s going to stress me into an early grave.",08Dec2020,1

It really messed with me because online learning is not for me, I feel like I can’t retain anything or focus, I even emailed my professors to check in with them on some concepts I had trouble learning. Everyone keeps telling me that they’re so proud I kept a high gpa but I don’t feel proud of myself at all. I’m happy about my gpa but I feel like I didn’t earn it, and that this semester was a complete waste. I just don’t have any motivation for anything anymore.

7,"I would say I have some kind of level of hypochondria. I often google symptoms and assume the worse. I'm not diagnosed with any kind of anxiety but mainly due to me not seeking help and resources not being good unless you have money. 

Aside from physical ailments, I get anxiety about getting psychosis or developing psychotic mental illness such as schizophrenia and hearing voices and disconnecting from reality. Once I dissociated and it was a really scary experience and I often feel disconnected from the world (though not totally dissociated like previous time) and things like this give me anxiety that I will develop a psychotic disorder or go through psychosis... Even though the logical part of my brain knows that probably won't happen. I think it's part of my anxiety.

I know i need to talk to someone but i have this feeling like i don't want to whenever i imagine doing it i get anxiety, and i feel like crying.

13,"*This is going to be a long post because i want to be as clear as possible, so sorry in advance but i really need help &amp; guidance.  Also, throwaway because irl people follow my main.*

I'm a 34 years old female and I've been struggling with my mental health, from a very young age. I'm also a domestic abuse survivor and i have experienced multiple traumas in my life. I've seen 3 different psychiatrists the last 5 years (and a couple of psychologists), and I've been misdiagnosed on some aspects, so I'm going to only list the ones that i received from the doctor I've been seeing the last 2-3 years, and that i also believe to be correct, if i can say so my self.

* Generalized Anxiety Disorder
* Somatic Symptom Disorder (ex somatoform disorder)
* Health Anxiety 
* Mild case of OCD, all health related
* C-PTSD (mostly under control now)
* Panic Disorder (i have developed enough coping mechanisms by now, somewhat controlled)
* Depression, i guess situational is the correct term, according to most doctors, my extreme anxiety is causing it

I was on Fluoxetine 40mg for almost 3 years and i can honestly say i saw a big difference. Most of my somatic symptoms either disappeared or didn't occur as often, my c-PTSD related problems stopped (nightmares, flashbacks, freezes etc) and i was doing much better. My anxiety/health anxiety were still there, but weren't controlling my life and i could tell my self I'm being silly half of the time.  These were not ""cured"" by any means, but i feel like the medication helped me pay less attention to my intrusive thoughts, and go about my day.

3 months ago, my psychiatrist suggested i get off of my medication. I was doing good, i had an extremely bad year where everything that could go wrong went wrong, but i somehow dealt with it just fine. The possibility of me getting pregnant was the main reason he suggested that, because in his opinion is best if I'm not on medications if I'm trying to conceive. The first month was OK-ish, i had some brain zaps and brain fog and a bit of depression,  i mostly dealt with it by knitting all day and self medicating a bit with alcohol (a couple of beers to relax). 

And then, everything came back and hit me like a ton of bricks. All my health anxiety and imaginary symptoms of freaky diseases that probably half of them don't even exist, feeling like my guts are tied in a knot 24/7, sweating, hyperventilating, having pains all over, you know how it goes...

Told my self I'm strong and i can fight it, but 2 months later it's getting worse and worse every day. Isolation doesn't help either.  I'm not even thinking about a baby anymore, because i know I'm not doing OK. I booked an appointment with my doctor next week. Since we kind of developed a friendship by now (*which I'm not sure if it helped in the long run*) i know he's going to ask me **what i want to do**? Should i go back to meds? And if i do, does it even work for my anxiety/health anxiety? I'm a control freak and my brain tells me i need to research every medication available and suggest the best one to him to give me, because ***google and my hypochondria know better****... (making light of it, because I'm embarrassed)*    
Am i a failure if i go back to meds? Will i ever feel ""normal"" again? I'm experiencing extreme self loathing lately, so I'm sorry for venting. I try not to bother anyone in my life and keep things to my self, i figured they're all sick of me talking about my issues by now.. So, I'm very much sorry for blowing up steam in here.

Lastly, i want to add that until now that I'm writing this, i still function everyday, i have a job (remote), i work out almost every day,  i spend all my free time studying (manically almost), eat and bathe regularly. I

14,"dont know if this is the best sub reddit to post this to, but here it goes.

hopefully writing this out into the world helps. mainly just vomiting out my thoughts and feelings here.

this year i was supposed to go to uni, but i didnt. currently doing a gap year. I was supposed to look for a job and take my drivers license, but i'm not doing that either. I moved to a new city because being home was super depressing and lonely, so i am now in the middle of a city where i have like 1 friend tbh.

i feel incapable of looking for a job or really doing anything, so i literally am paying rent in another city just to not do anything.

I feel so lost and lonely here, everyone I know is at uni and im doing nothing. been feeling super depressed lately.

Yesterday it marked 30 days since i last self harmed and honestly i feel like relapsing, i want it so bad. that feeling feels like the only warm hug i could possibly ever receive, as if no one cares about me.

Yesterday, i also went to sleep on a guy's place i've been seeing. He doesnt know really anything about me because i cant open up, not even that i struggle with self harm. He was kinda ghosting me the last few days, but because it was my 30 days yesterday and i was feeling an urge I felt the need to reach out to someone. Because my friend was also ignoring me, I sent that guy a message. He said I could come over but never asked what was happening. while we were trying to fall asleep I couldnt stop shaking. It had just marked the 30 days, at 3 am, and I was shaking and kinda in panic, but didnt ask for help. I asked if he could hug me and he said no, asked him again and he said it wouldnt be comfortable to sleep in that position, but all i needed was a hug. He told me to stop shaking cause he couldnt sleep. he tried to get me warm because I told him I was cold, only with holding my hand, so he didnt actually make an effort to comfort me. I got up and went to the bathroom and calmed myself down. Got to the bed and we both fell asleep. then when we woke up we were face to face, kissed 2 times (we didnt kiss until that moment all that time) and looked each other in the eye. caressed each other a bit and then he got up to be with his housemates. after a while i got up too and he was cooking lunch. we ate. he went to shower, i waited on his room. he came, put on perfume and went to be with his housemates again, this time to their room, so i didnt feel okay going, nor did i feel like i was supposed to. after 30 mins i told him to come, he said he didnt want to. after 30 mins more i was if he wanted me to leave and he said ""what are you waiting for? i dont feel like being with you to be honest"". I left. on my way home i was convinced i was going to relapse. I felt unloved, which has been he biggest struggle lately, feeling unloved. I smoked two cigarrettes really fast, which for me is really bad, and ended up feeling super bad when i got home. vomited and went to sleep, woke up and now im here, numb as fuck.

this little episode represents love in my life tbh. I have always been rejected. by parents, classmates, friends, lovers, everyone. two of my best friends stopped talking to me after i opened up about my self harm. I am completely alone.

Last week i went to see a psychologist for the first time and it helped me understand that. My problem is feeling unloved. when people try and love me i cant help but dissociate. love is foreign to me, 100 per cent. I feel like i cant even move when someone's kissing me. I feel annoying, like i dont have a personality, like im not interesting, like im just a pile of shit tbh.

Im supposed to look for a job. i cant... im so fucking depressed it hurts. Im in a new city alone, no one cares for me. it was the same in my hometown. but here i feel useless. dont know what to do",08Dec2020,1

I can just sit on my bed and I don’t have to worry whether I’ll be sobbing the next day, my house isn’t scary anymore and noises don’t make me flinch. I’ve sat in class so many times just listening to the teacher and looking around at everyone and I’ve felt so safe and happy and lucky and like life was really worth living. I felt like happiness was exploring from my chest. Sometimes I can’t stop smiling and I feel silly but I am so so grateful. It’s made me look around as well and see how lucky I am to have the family I have, people to talk to, and I have so many advantages that I am grateful for. It hasn’t been perfect, I get side effects and meltdowns but they’re so infrequent that I’m not scared any more.

Two months ago I wanted to overdose my SSRI medication. But in the end I didn't. I threw them in my drawer and just carried on.

19,"I always defended him, and excused his behaviour just because his mother died when he was twelve and that “it wasn’t his fault” because of mommy issues....

I finally realised how abusive and manipulative he was. 

I made a list of things he has done through the year and a half we’ve been together (the things/ incidents I can think of at the moment)

• three times I told him that I didn’t want to date him, I don’t know what happened - somehow he managed to manipulate me into a relationship 

• he criticised my looks and personality constantly and in front of others, to make me so insecure that I would think, that he would be the only one to put up with my “bs”

• he once locked me out on his balcony, cut his hand with a knife only to “see how I would react, and if I really loved him”

• he has cheated on me too many times... the first three times he didn’t even feel like he should tell me as he “wouldn’t ever do it again” 

• he often pressured me to have sex with him, and did me in the fucking ass even though I repeatedly told him no. I often had to use physical force to get him to stop. He told me that it was his right as my boyfriend to have sex with me when he wanted to.

• he took his condom off once without me knowing, as he liked the idea of his child inside of me, even though he wanted me to get an abortion either way. I have gotten 2 abortions because of this. 

• he would often wrestle me for “fun” - he would throw me on the ground until I got bruised up or had to yell at him to stop.

• he had to share our sex life with everyone, including my family and friends. The first time he met my best friend he told me that “they now had to share my pussy” and proceeded to tell her about me being fucked by him.

• he has taken pictures of me naked while I slept and has shared them with his best friends.

• when we first started dating he cut my finger with a piece of paper - I bled - and he made the excuse that “he just didn’t know how to act around me”

• he was dependent on me to do everything practical around the apartment.

• he stole money from me

• he acted like I was his mother when we were out grocery shopping, and would beg me to buy him candy - always expecting me to pay.

• in the time we’ve been together I have had two birthdays - he didn’t attend either of them - and he has never given me a birthday present or Christmas gift. 


I know now that I can trust my family, when they tell me a partner isn’t doing me any good...

22,"Hey, everybody. First post on Reddit here. I was really questioning if I should write on here, but I eventually decided to do it. Excuse me if I make any mistakes, english is not my first language.
So... I dont know where to start. My life is a complete mess rn. Im in my second year in university, studying art. When I finished school (I studied French there) I decided I want to pursue a career in the art sphere, although I was already admitted to a university where I would have continued my studies with languages. But just because drawing has always been a great passion of mine and because I had this fire in my heart for it, I decided to go this way and study art. Yeah, okay but it wasn't what i have really expected. One year has passed, now it's the first half of the second year and I'm really thinking about dropping out. I'm so disappointed, I just don't feel at place. I don't feel like I'm as good as my colleagues, i feel really uninspired, burned out. Also one of my professors is like absolute shit, I am literally SCARED to have a conversation with her, just because she makes me feel like I dont have the required skills, like I don't belong there. She's also verbally attacking us sometimes.And i keep working, giving all of myself but I still feel like shit and as if I'm not good enough.  This gives me EXTREME anxiety. I literally have nausea from this anxiety, I lost a lot of weight, I stopped eating, I became more introverted and shy. All of this anxiety is building up. Eventually, a few weeks earlier, I experienced my first panic attack. 
Also I am sure that since the beginning of this school year, I have been in a serious depression. 
All of this aside, I feel like I'm mentally ill or something. I have this, I would call it 'brain fog' that's literally like moving to different areas in my brain. That's how i would describe it. I have experienced brain fog before, but it has never been this worse. One day it would affect my communication abilities, the next day it would be my ability to count, or to read, or smth like that. Like if I sit to read an article I read one fuckin sentence at least ten times. Its so annoying. I feel like i have gotten dumber since I left school, its so bizarre. Since like, idk a few months I tend to forget everything (and im usually not like that, i have a really sharp memory). For example there are times where i cant recall what have I been doing two days ago. And that's not typical for me! I cant remember half of the memories I made this summer... Also I cant make a difference in time. I feel 5 minutes as an hour and sometimes an hour as 5 minutes. Like i take a shower and I cant understand how long I have been inside. 
Im not concentrated at all, I am completely unmotivated, I just want to sleep and do nothing (but i cant cuz university, ya know).
A month ago I started going to therapy but I still havent found the reasons for this brain thingy thats going on. 
Has someone been in a mental state close to this? I just can't explain what is going on with me...
I just feel so fuckin lost and the idea of dropping out combinated with this mental state I have been in + a lot other problems going on in my life, are making me scared, anxious and miserable. Life to me is pointless. I feel like I'm in a hole and as if I won't be able to get out if it...



P.S. I don't really know why I wrote all of this considering probably no one would care, but I just needed to get it of my chest.",08Dec2020,1
23,"Maybe this is more of a rant, I don’t know. I saw a post somewhere else on Reddit that reminded me of this (don’t remember what post). But I despise people asking “how are you” EVERY SINGLE CONVERSATION. Like it’s so weird to use as a greeting because rarely do people want the actual answer. And I’m not going to just go into all the crap in my life every time someone asks but I also can’t get myself to say I’m good or I’m great because those feel too much like lying. So I literally always say “I’m ok”

When I wasn’t struggling with my mental health it wasn’t that big of a deal. But now that I am, I realize how insensitive the question can feel to someone struggling. I think we need to stop asking unless we mean it. Like I get anxiety every time someone asks because of my mental gymnastics of if I should give an honest answer or not.

32,"So first off I want to bring up that this is not about me. This is about my girlfriend who has in incredible amount of trouble finding the purpose to commit to things. Let me explain. 

So throughout her life, my girlfriend has experienced a multitude of experiences that caused her to act this way. Whenever she would commit to something, it would always turn out bad for her. This in turn causes her to question whether or not it’s worth stressing herself out over this. She used to be in band and wanted to be in a program where the best of the best are. She commited so much effort into it, yet she never got into it. But other kids who didn’t put as much effort into it, or put no effort at all were able to. These experiences built up, resulting in her developing anxiety and depression. She has had multiple experiences just like this one, but I’d rather not talk about them. 

Recently, we were playing league of legends and we’ve been playing for almost a year now. But she had trouble with a champion. So I try to help her understand how to play that champion and she does what she can. But she keeps losing and inevitably, she starts talking about how much she sucks at the game and how she’s never gonna get good. She starts thinking about if it worth commiting this much effort into it. She worries that the same exact thing will happen if she puts this much effort into this champion. She doesn’t know if she’s gonna do good or bad, and if all of the effort and time she put into it is just going to be for nothing. I’ve tried to reassure her that everything will get better, but she doesn’t believe that.

I’ve talked to this about her a lot recently. But I’m left clueless as to what I can do now. I’m trying my best to be with her through this and make sure this doesn’t happen again, but ultimately I want her to be happy. I want her to be content with her choices, not go through anxiety because she doesn’t know if her commitment will actually pay off. I’m worried that this could affect our relationship too. But this isn’t about me, it’s about her. I’m clueless as to what options I have now. I feel so bad. I just want to help her.",08Dec2020,1

This sounds stupid, but I feel lost and mediocre and identity-less on my meds. I was really dysfunctional and failing at school, work, life in general before I got on meds but now that I’m on them, and a bit more functional, I feel like all the good parts have been taken away. I experienced some major academic success during my hypomanias. My professors were all so enthusiastic about my work and wanted me to publish. I was producing all of this objectively great stuff, making friends for the first time, was kind of the life of the party and I was starting to really believe in myself and see a future for myself as some sort of artist or academic. I was getting so much positive feedback and I formed my whole identity around my hypomanic symptoms. It was a welcome relief after spending the first half of my life being depressed and struggling with very low self esteem (and self hatred), ADHD and social anxiety.

Now I feel like it’s being taken away from me. I haven’t produced anything as good as used to and I feel like I was just being delusional the whole time. It’s like I’m finding out that all of my favorite parts of myself and all of the stuff I thought of as some sort of “specialness” were symptoms of my illness. Without hypomania I feel worthless. I’m just like everyone else now, except worse in every way. Before I was still worse but also better, if that makes sense.

I know, objectively, that those states of mind that I loved so much were symptoms of sickness but still, I miss them so much. I also know that they’ve lead to horrible full blown manias before, with psychotic symptoms and everything, and major depressive episodes too. Still, I feel like I was using my bipolar symptoms (principally the hypomanic ones) as way to almost compensate for my constant feelings of inferiority and worthlessness and unlovability. But now that my bipolar is starting to get under control, it feels like my coping mechanism has been taken away and I’m left with no self esteem or identity. I just want my old self back.

43,"Hi y’all. For around 8 years now, I (24 F) have struggled with clinically diagnosed anxiety and severe depression that was triggered by the terminal illness and loss of a parent. I have a family history of mental illness as well, which hasn’t helped.   
**I’ve begun to really analyze my “bad” days and I’ve come to realize that my depression, though severe, seems to mostly be a byproduct of my anxiety. It seems that the answer as to why I always feel so devastatingly sad, hopeless and empty is almost always “because I’m afraid of \_\_\_\_,” “\_\_\_\_ could happen,” “I don’t know what I would do if \_\_\_\_.” And of course, there are also those days where I don’t have an answer.**  
I’m a miserably anxious person, whether it’s about my health, the health and safety of loved ones, freak accidents and often nothing in particular. I believe that if I could treat and better manage my anxiety, my depression could be greatly alleviated.  
I know that everybody is different, but I still wanted to ask for your experiences here. **Have you found a medication that has significantly helped manage your anxiety?** Benzos for acute episodes, I know, but I was thinking more along the lines of SSRIs, or any other class that is more sustainable for potential long-term use.   
I’m unfortunately in a position where my insurance offers no mental health coverage whatsoever, and regular therapy sessions seem out of the question, at least for now. If there are other more affordable recommendations for treatment or resources that I could look into in lieu of therapy (books, apps, guided meditation and the like), I’d greatly appreciate those as well.

Due to the virus, we cannot take anything on our own so instead, we are given everything by a cafeteria staff member; I know most of them by now since I eat there regularly. This one day I walk in and there is a huge line. I get my food and wait in line. Slowly I make it to the drink station and the person there says ""Green tea, right bud?"" and I say ""Ye-"" and he dramatically presents a green tea ready for me, the way I usually take it. It felt surreal, he saw me during his shifts take this and this time had it ready regardless of the huge line in front of me. I felt very happy.

I tried searching for similar posts and there were absolutely none of help. Please do not remove it!

I am 23M and for the past year have been having bouts of psychological difficulty achieving an erection. It really began in March, which lines up with you know what. I like many others began to masturbate a lot more and things were well for a month before things stopped working physically. I stopped for good and saw a doctor about it and a bunch of other health problems I was having. A slew of tests including STD panel and Testosterone tests and Blood work. I was healthy as a horse. However I still was unable to fix my health issues. We suspect it was adrenal fatigue caused by stress and overactive cortisol. Fast forward to late summer and I finally go visit some family and like overnight everything went back to normal. 

Unfortunately, I took advantage of that again and by September, my member was physically gone again. I have since moved back in with family and again had a bunch of tests done, same health results but the erections have not returned. 

I have consulted a sex therapist online and they told me it wad certainly psychologically caused dysfunction as I suspected. I assume I am harboring a good amount of depression and anxiety subconsciously and I am making an effort every day to overcome this to no avail for months. Some days rarely i test out my member to see if there is any improvement and while I can manage an erection with great physical stimulus, it never happens anymore without any physical stimulus. I used to be having them randomly with no stimulus every several hours like a healthy man. My sex drive is also nonexistent. 

I have had a couple casual partners since this all began and I have not been able to achieve an orgasm. Once I even tried using a blue pill to see if I could achieve confidence back and it was to no sexual satisfaction at all and I think it made it more difficult to have an orgasm, which I was not able to again. 

I also achieve morning and sleep erections with no stimulus and they immediately disappear upon waking up. I have tried everything under the sun and there is still something blocking me from achieving regular sexual function again. I’m waiting for the day I will get a spontaneous erection or feel the slightest desire for sex again. I do not have a long term partner or any partner for that matter and I don’t think it would even be plausible with this going on. 

Please!!! Can anyone offer any advice? I don’t know what else to do and taking my mind off of it provided no results so I don’t know what else to do but to panic at this point.",08Dec2020,1

Well I finally found a way to get people to understand. Here is goes. 


Imagine you’re standing in the middle of a stadium. It’s dark. You are standing there trying to read , comprehend, and retain Shakespeare. It’s a difficult book, and takes focus, and determination. (This is life. Everyone is just trying to retain and understand going through life. 

Now with me,   I am trying to read Shakespeare (my book of life) while every single seat in that stadium is full. And all the people filling the seats are screaming at me. I can’t make out the words. But I just feels like I am being screamed at 24/7 while trying to retain the complex literature in front of me. So I am trying my best to keep up with everyone else who gets to read their book in peace and quiet, even though I am being harassed and over stimulated while trying to read mine. 

On top of this, there are days where I am not so over whelmed and the “noise” settles. But that’s what the dark intrusive thoughts come in. And I just continue to beat myself up inside. 


One little thing sets me off because I feel like there are already 73927483 things going on at one time.

54,"My husband is a happy go lucky, doesn't let anything bother him kind of guy. I'm ultra realistic, highly empathetic with chronic depression and anxiety. I can't *not* see the injustices and corruption around me. This year has me feeling extremely detached and emotionally overwhelmed (as I'm sure many other people are feeling). However, despite how much I'm struggling, I feel I cannot talk to my husband about my concerns, feelings, frustrations, etc because he just doesn't get it. 

He told me tonight, ""Just look at the positive things around you."" And while that may seem lovely, it doesn't feel realistic with society up in flames like it is. He also said, ""I just don't focus on the negative."" Which has me thinking he's like everyone else, living with his head in the sand, pretending things aren't happening because God forbid he feel uncomfortable. 

I don't want my husband to be miserable like I am, but I do want him to be more of a comfort to me. Is it too much to ask that he be a little more involved in my recovery? I use that term because I am working very hard to change my thought and behavior patterns, but I feel so alone doing it.

I was just wondering if anyone could give me any reassuring stories or experiences.",08Dec2020,1
65,"Firstly, I am aware you’re not professionals. I’m sharing what I feel in hopes of finding people who are diagnosed and who experience/d these symptoms, so that I can learn more about it. If I could afford a psychiatrist, therapist or go see a counselor (my school doesn’t have one) I would. I just want to know what I could possibly have.

I’m a 16 year old girl, I don’t smoke, drink or do any delinquent activities, and I’ve never been to therapy or been diagnosed with a mental illness before. My mom had severe OCD though.

For the past 2 years, I’ve been feeling like people (who I don’t personally know, could be celebrities or people I used to like or just random people in general) are watching me at home when I’m by myself or with my family, and judging me for the most simple actions and tasks and daily necessities: Going to the toilet? Gross. Preparing a meal? You’re doing it the wrong way. Praying? Ridiculous (?) Dressing in a certain way? What the hell are you wearing. Taking a selfie? You’re not pretty/you look foolish. Listening to music? Your taste sucks. Reading a certain book (on wattpad)? What are you, 9? They basically ridicule literally everything I do. 

I don’t hear them or see them. I don’t feel like they’re speaking either. I only imagine them in ly head, I’m aware of that, except I can’y stop acting weird “around them”.

I started doing some some extremely normal stuff in the dark (like going to the toilet with lights off) so that they can’t see me. I’m worried about what they think or that they’re laughing at me to the point that I don’t even enjoy stuff I used to. And I even started talking to myself as if I was making clarifications and justifications to them regarding what I’m doing. For example, I could say “Ew, that’s really gross.” which will match what *they think of me* therefore they’d think it’s out of my control and won’t judge me for it.

I was literally just doing the dishes in nothing but a very dim light. Doing the dishes. 

Also, I don’t think these are exactly hallucinations but I sometimes see shadows with the corner of my eye, but I think it’s just as normal as mistaking a pile of clothes for a ghost.

Those are details that I feel like I would list if I had a therapist:


I have violent mood swings that occur very often in a day, could be each 6 hours or each 30 minutes. Maybe even every 2 days. Nothing triggers these mood swings though. 

These mood swings do not result in me harming myself in any way, however. 

I also randomly switch from feeling very hyperactive to having no motivation whatsoever.

I forget very, very often that I have to write down things on my hand or pieces of paper to remember them.

Also, I thought I’d say this because maybe it could be my potential mental disorder manifesting itself: I used to create fake profiles for no malicious intentions whatsoever, except to make friends and experiencing what life would be like if I was that person, as I’ve endured a long history of bullying from my own family and friends. It’s a form of escapism. I don’t think I’m ugly and tbh, I’ve been told I’m pretty many times, I have my insecurities, but this isn’t why I did it. I don’t seem to know why I feel the need to do so, really.


Someone suggested I have social anxiety but I don’t act weird around actual people. I’m perfectly fine in crowds. I’m only anxious around those inexistent people. I read a lot about it online and I think I either have paranoia (I don’t believe anyone wants to harm me) or some schizophrenic/schizoïde/schizoaffective disorder. 

It’s taking over my life and my parents believe everything can be cured by following the path of god or whatever and don’t take my mental health seriously, and I can’t afford therapy myself. Please provide any helpful opinions.

As I said I’m well aware you aren’t professionals. I’m just gathering information and opinions to look for methods to maybe reduce these symptoms until I can afford therapy. 

I know I’m a minor, but I’m sadly a part of a society that doesn’t prioritize mental health for kids nor adults or teens, there’s so much stigma surrounding it. 

If there’s any therapist in this subreddit who’s willing to only direct me to the right path so I could have accurate information, (I’m not asking for treatment), I’d highly appreciate that.

Take care.",08Dec2020,1

Please believe me when i say that these things, even in fiction, have a rich history of causing me anxiety attacks, but the way i would describe 'getting into this' game is it literally feels like i was dragged by the hair and that my own brain is holding my hostage.

71,"Hi r/mentalhealth. I am currently going through the process of trying different meds with my doctor, but i haven’t been totally honest with my doctor. Simply because I’m scared. I’m frightened of what will happen if I tell the truth. 

I live with my boyfriend, who works 5 days a week. He works very long hours and I am home alone a lot. During this time I become very paranoid. Especially if I am sleep deprived, which is a lot. 

My mind becomes absolutely convinced that someone is waiting upstairs to hurt me. I absolutely KNOW this isn’t true, that it’s just my stupid anxiety brain, but it doesn’t stop these thoughts from being scary. During these times I will do absolutely everything to avoid going upstairs, and will even sometimes block the door with a guitar (lol). It’s so stupid because I absolutely know no one is up there, but putting something, anything, against the door just eases my anxiety a little bit. 

Furthermore, we have a boiler in our living room cupboard and I sometimes get randomly scared that it will explode. When I get that thought I obsess over it for a few hours until it wears off. I usually sleep these thoughts off, including the one about someone being upstairs. 

So, my question is: are these thoughts delusions? Or paranoia? Or both? Like I said, I’m going through the process with my GP of trying different meds (last ones didn’t work out) and so I’m just curious as to what these thoughts are.

76,"*TRIGGER WARNING*

Hi! I’m a 21F in the USA. I have been dealing with depression and anxiety and ADHD pretty much my whole life. Officially diagnosed when I was in middle school. I was getting better and improving. Was even going to start to wean off of my medications. Then...shit hit the fan. Now I feel like I am at square 1. My medications had to be bumped up. And after multiple events (bf turning out to be a jerk and breaking up with him and the drama that ensued, backstabbing lying coworker/“friend”, stupidly pulling over so a stranger could exchange numbers and then him not leaving until I jerked him off, waking up to a “friend” groping me, telling his gf about it and then being called manipulative and being threatened to be beat up, friend giving me the silent treatment when I was saying the truth, friend’s sister blaming me for my friend’s actions that ruined her own life, Covid, etc.) I ended up having a bad anxiety attack or mental breakdown last week. I bought an xacto knife made a couple of marks on my leg, punched my leg, barely ate, cried until my head hurt, screamed in my car, and puked. I also messaged my friends asking if I was a manipulative person. My main therapist thinks I should try outpatient therapy, but I am scared. I was just wondering: 

1. What is outpatient therapy like? 
2. Is it worth it? 
3. Should I try it?",08Dec2020,1

80,"TL;DR -- Some of the language around ‘emotional boundaries’ and ‘emotional responsibility’ strikes me as individualistic and capitalistic in a way that depresses me.

—

I'm 24F and I've spent the last 12 years of my life grieving the sudden loss of my twin brother at age 12. I was successful in my education and career up until our 22nd birthday, when I fell apart and was sectioned and sent to to a psych ward. I was hospitalized on two separate occasions that year.

Since then, I've done tons of CBT, DBT, and ACT, I’m medicated, I'm in therapy twice a week even though I can't afford it, I release music about my grief, I journal frequently... I’m trying to take care of myself — you get the picture.

But the minute my twin died, I didn’t want to live anymore. Everybody said we’ll be here for you, we’ll hold you through it. I said that’s not true, at some point I will be told to figure it out myself — but people were desperate and insisted I was wrong.

So, it’s hard as an adult. I feel I am doing everything in my power to keep myself together. But so much of the lingo I hear about mental health these days is about how ultimately everybody is their own emotional responsibility. 

And that just makes me think fuck, I shouldn’t have listened to everyone else when I was 12; I should’ve just killed myself right then. Like damn, in all my life I never worked as hard as I am working on my mental health now, but the only thing that has ever made me feel less like dying is being held by someone else.

I ESPECIALLY hate when anyone says oh just share with your therapist. Like, I have to pay money I don’t have in a transaction with a stranger, to share the most intimate and vulnerable part of my life? Seeing a therapist is extremely useful but it does not replace emotional support from loved ones.

There is no way to be responsible for yourself under those conditions and there’s something strangely capitalist / individualist about just tossing sad people into institutions to be dealt with by professionals. Again, not that professional support is without value, but it is not a replacement for emotional support from the community.

Of course there are instances when you no longer have the capacity to help someone, when the person is abusive or dangerous... but I would like to make a distinction and say that’s not what I’m talking about. 

There’s just something about the way I hear ‘emotional responsibility’ thrown around that rubs me the wrong way. Telling a suicidal person that they’re emotionally responsible for themselves feels like telling someone with a broken leg that they’re responsible for their own surgery or their own cast. Like sure, maybe that’s true philosophically, but that person sure as hell doesn’t have the resources to get there by themselves. 

I think sometimes people are not able to be emotionally responsible for themselves, and of course no one is obligated to do anything about anything, but I think there are circumstances that should override emotional boundaries. I know those exist for me; if someone I love is in the kind of distress I was, I will do everything in my power to help alleviate their pain.",08Dec2020,1

85,"I had a very big fight with a friend that ended up in them dumping me and me not being that emotionally stable during my fourth period (fight triggered a very awful meltdown with memories from middle school flooding me in.)

Anyways; due to that fight, I wasn’t comfortable with talking to my friends on the group chat because he was there too and I just didn’t felt comfortable with being myself after he said all those things about me there. So I distanced myself from all my friends to recharge after that bad moment, they were all very cool with it and they let me know that they still love me even if I don’t talk as often.

That fight was in Mid-October, I haven’t contacted any of my friends since then. Just now, my mom confronted me about it and she made me realize that other than school stuff, I haven’t have a decent chat with any of my friends for months now. And the more I thought about it, the more it clicked to me that I honestly haven’t talked to anyone, not even my internet friends. I haven’t hanged out with anyone not only because of the quarantine, but also because I don’t have someone to go get coffee with, or even the drive to make or join plans.

I feel so disconnected from everything. I feel like my head is somewhere else every time I wake up, it’s either school, my current hyperfixation or keeping chat with the only two people I actually talk with. I try to keep myself composed, it’s normal to feel like this during these times, but it’s been so normal to lay in bed and just go blank.

I don’t even know if I’m wording it correctly. Tbh, I don’t know shit about what the fuck is going on in my head at this point. I’m sorry.",08Dec2020,1
86,"I’ve gone through some seriously traumatic shit this year and my family is under the impression that I have persevered and totally gotten over it. They don’t talk about all that happened or anything and praise me for being totally ok and figuring it all out. 

But I’m definitely not ok and idk what to do. I think back to who I was 6 months ago and it’s a different person in every possible way. Now I’m reckless with my body and my safety. I’ve never been quick to give people my body and now I had unprotected Sex like a month ago and didn’t even consider the possible of STDs. I’m distracted all the time. I got into a car accident last week and I got a ticket today for speeding. I cry all the time. I hate my job and for the first time in my life I have a fleeting thought of “what if I just ended things?” I also had a fleeting thought about writing a note. There’s lapses in my memory. My sleep is terrible. I feel worthless, useless, like an imposter to my own life. I haven’t acted on anything and I don’t think I could but I know I need help. My parents are not fans of mental health stuff so idk how to go about this. I don’t have the money, especially with the car repairs and ticket. Idk what to do.",08Dec2020,1
87,"For the past couple months there have been at least a couple times a week where it feels like I have no emotion. Things that used to make me happy won’t make me happy and also things that used to make me sad sometimes won’t make me sad either.

I could even be relaxing and watching my favorite shows and all of a sudden I’m bored out of my mind. When I’m around friends and start to not feel anything it seems like they are all on a different wavelength than me and I can’t interact with them. Another way to describe it is it feels like the world is happening and I can’t interact with it.

89,"Basically I just feel like I need to rant and vent, because I'm starting to feel like it's all getting too much... First of all, as awkward as it is to talk about, an ultrasound reviled I have a Varicocele on both side of my testicles so I see a Urologist in 2 weeks to see if I qualify for surgery. Apparently it's built up for so long it's really impacted the size of my testicles. That bit I'm really nervous about and really not looking forward to it... Kinda freaks me out. 

Been told they found brain damage after a bunch of tests...

On top of that, I've been also diagnosed with nerve damage and my neurologist wants me to go out of state to a special clinic. I guess it's more complex then normal, so she's telling me I really need to go across country for special tests. It's only been getting worse over the years which finally made my doctor have me see a specialist. I've passed out multiple times for example, can have a resting heart rate of 150, over heat, dizzy, stop being able to talk, can even start walking like I'm drunk and can even almost pass out on a side walk, a store, on a bike, etc...

To make matters more complicated in my life, I've had a pretty loving relationship for some time (About 3 years), but she's gotten so distant in the past month and a half, despite seeming to feeling the same, and has been slowly building up even before that. Things have really declined and she kinda dropped off the face of the earth after a death. She still messages me, but only for like a half an hour every like 2 weeks and thats all I hear from her and haven't heard really anything. It really gives this empty void because it's the first time I've really actually loved someone and really need her. She was in an abusive household for awhile far away, finally moved out and not far away (Very recently), with lots of plans to be close, having romantic moments, etc. Though her fear has gotten in the way a lot of times. Things started really looking up, like they were improving and was getting really hopeful once when she moved, starting to finally say some of the loving things she used to say but haven't been physically close, I think she's just nervous after finally being so close after a long time. After the death in the family, has just disappeared, way more then normal (At max in the past would be a week when things were really really hard, but kinda rare) Used to talk on the phone every day and now I haven't heard her voice in over a month and a half. She used to be so loving for like the greater part of our relationship, but the past 3rd of a year has been rather hard for her... The distance has been really building up over the past 1/3rd of a year, loving statements have been really declining because of her dealing with a lot, despite her saying feelings will never change, but has some problems sometimes falling through what she says in terms of actions a lot of times. Really seems like she's shifted into not being able to handle a relationship over the past 3rd of a year and has kinda told me that and I've been really really patient, being understanding, but my hearts really starting to crumble and don't know what to do with that as well. I feel like I can't even address anything because of how she's been. I really know she loves me romantically, I'm trying to still be understanding and give it some hope, but after so long (The 3rd of a year maybe more honestly its hard to keep trakc) I'm really starting to feel the impact. I know if I ""leave"" she'd really feel way worse and heart broken. My therapist is starting to recommend soon I tell her she really needs to step on the plate and if she doesn't then just leave because it's turning toxic to my mental health and has been slowly for the 3rd of the year. My therapist is really working with me on the ""Hard when two people really love each other but at different stages of life"" bit... The abusive household I think really got deep into her and has really impacted things for awhile. Feel like it's just been a wave of hope and and hardship for awhile now on tons of things not just relationship wise.. Last time I got to see her (over a month and a half ago), I can really see in her eyes and actions that she has strong feelings for me.... but again different stages or idk.. though was pretty nervous. I can really tell she can't handle much at the moment, I feel really empty, heart broken after over all this time, and also hardship/distance lots of times. She's someone very dear to me... Which honestly don't blame her that much, after going through a tonnnnnn of bad life events during the past 3 years. It's not like I can wait around forever, though... Therapist is recommending giving it a few months. I really really don't want to give up, but again things have built up. Seems like forever ago we were kissing and cuddling (even though that was just 4 months ago). She's helped me so much for a long time and I feel like I wouldn't really be here right now if it were not for her and the past few years. She's really been my rock for a long time... and with all of this stuff happening at once I feel like I don't have a rock anymore and feel like I haven't had the rock much at all over the 3rd of the year. Maybe I'm worrying over nothing... but if my therpist is starting to say soon might be a time I should leave for my own good but give her the option to work on things.

Then my dad pretty much left my life, not even caring at all about me (Feel like I'm too old to care since I'm 30 but still really stings...). I make so little a month from disability since work triggers episodes... and who wants someone to work for them when they're going into psychosis in the work place? I can't afford a place of my own. I tried school to get my dream degree and completely failed almost owing the school 8 grand. I've gotten kicked out of 2 schools since I keep having to take breaks and feel punished for even trying. I try soooo hard and never give up but feel like I keep getting punished over and over again for even trying to go to school just because sometimes I need to leave. Getting a degree has been a huge goal of mine and have tried non stop... but losing hope in that as well and again just feel punished for trying...

I have schizophrenia and all of this has really made things worse. I can't take antipsychotics or most antidepressants because they send me to the hospital. I'm really starting to have too many huge spikes in depression sometimes so bad I just want to die or can't leave my bed. I'm worried about surgery, myself, my general health, someone I love still, losing my ability to really handle with my coping skills which usually work fairly well... I'm hearing voices again, getting paranoid, visually hallucinating and I feel like the list goes on. I'm starting to have huge desires to drink which has never happened, I feel like my life is utterly pointless, that nothing good will ever happen. Seems like all my life is is just one disappointment after another. I've been physically abused when a teenager, sexually abused, emotionally abused, abandoned multiple times and more all throughout my life. Now just feels like it's all happening again even after a few years of actually doing alright and feeling loved and supported. I got over a lot of things after tons of therapy but it's all starting to come back with all mentioned

Everything in my life just seems to be getting way out of hand and out of my control. It's just one thing after another and all of this has pretty much happened in only the last 2 months.   
I just want to die and have no hope but feel like I only stay around for my mom. 

Thanks for reading and letting me rant. Really scared of judgment since I've never posted anything like this before :\\. Kinda thinking no one will read this but at least I put myself out there... Feel like a lot of me is just being stupid. If someone wants to post advice, just know it's hard to handle big chunks of info, so please be simple :(",08Dec2020,1
90,"I've been having some pretty disturbing dreams for a few years now and I feel like they are getting worse. I am not sure if they are in relation to some sort of stress, due to a mental condition I already have like anxiety, depression or PTSD or are caused by something different I am not aware of.

The thing that really scares me about these dreams is that they no longer cause me to wake up scared in a cold sweat, they do still cause me to wake up but I have become so numb to the horrors in my own mind that I just turn over, go back to sleep and have another one until it is time to get up.

I just don't know what to do about them anymore and they just effect my mood for the rest of the day making everything a little bit harder.",08Dec2020,1
91,"About five months ago I had a severe five day panic attack and I’ve been struggling ever since. There are many things I’m struggling with, but when I’m in those states or a little on edge I’ll be out at a grocery store or something and listen to the music playing. Sometimes the songs aren’t bad, but most of the time I automatically read into them with the narrative of the panic attack. Often telling me to let go and commit suicide, that everything will be okay. This paired with intense deja vu makes it rough because it further implies the narrative. 

These symptoms are similar to a form of seizure (TLE) but I got an mri and eeg test that came bag negative. I just don’t know anymore and I feel helpless. I’m on antidepressants, but they’ve only helped me so much. Most of my progress ha come from self care. 

I could go on and on, but I guess I’m just wondering if anyone can relate or give me advice.",08Dec2020,1
92,"For a couple of weeks I was riding on a positive high...not crying out of the blue, not feeling like a total worthless POS, feeling optimistic and feeling good about getting some things done.

Starting to get harder to get up and out of bed again...I want to sleep forever and not wake up to face another day of dealing with the constant battle in my head. Non-stop cycle of regretting what I did, wishing I can go back and fix it, asking myself wtf is wrong with me...all while trying to pretend everything’s ok in front of my family...I can’t anymore.

I know why I feel like this and I can't really fix it, and I doubt my friends can either, but I also have no therapist now because I finished grad school and I'm trying to move soon. I know I need to reach out to a friend so that at least someone like gets the full extent and I know you're supposed to tell someone when you're suicidal, but I don't know how to do it in a way that isn't manipulative or scary in some way to them. I also don't know what friend to even tell, since I don't want to just focus all my trauma and other bullshit on one person. I haven't been this actively suicidal in years and it's scaring me. I'm using all the coping mechanisms I know, but sometimes it still doesn't feel like enough.",08Dec2020,1
94,"So as some of you may be aware, people with BPD can often have trouble regulating their emotions and reactions, and tend to feel like the world is against them. For instance, if you forgot to bring my sister orange juice from the store, she often would interpret that as you being upset with her. She doesn’t do this intentionally. She can’t help it. It’s the way her brain is wired. She is 15, I am 23. We are very close and always had a great relationship. I have been a large part of her support system in her mental health struggles and she often comes to me when she is upset. A couple years ago I got my own apartment, which was difficult for her, but I only lived about five minutes away and the transition wasn’t too difficult for her. My girlfriend and I have been together almost a year now, and my sister and her are very close as well which means more to me than I could every be able to express. My sister often refers to my girlfriend as her sister and as family and it makes us both so happy. We love my sister a lot, and she is very attached to us. 

Here is my problem. My girlfriends brother was in a car accident, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. Their parents are too ill to care for him, so my girlfriend and I are going to move in for at lesser several months to help him out. He is a single father and is really struggling in the wake of his injury. We would be moving several hours away to a different city, as soon as possible. I am excited for this adventure if not a bit scared at leaving my hometown, but if worst comes to worst we can always move back home. 

I am worried this news will upset my sister. After a terrible 2018 and 2019, she has finally stabilized and is doing very well! She has described to me that when things feel out of control she struggles a lot more, but when she is just at home with our parents and can “take inventory” of her life, sort of depend on constants, she feels better. My girlfriend and I are some of those constants that my sister relies on to keep steady. I am afraid of what will happen when my girlfriend and I are removed from her immediate life and social circle. Of course our move will not be permanent and we will most likely move back home because our families are both here, and I know my sister will understand why we have to go, but I still just don’t think she will handle it well. And again, that isn’t her fault. She can’t control it. 

So how can I help her understand that we aren’t moving because we hate her and we don’t want her around? Or that we want her dead? She has expressed to me this is often what it feels like when someone “sights” her, off you will. She means the absolute world to me and I want to make this as calm and manageable for her as possible. 

Please, if you have experience with this, what should I do? How do I approach this? I have had discussions with our parents about this and we are trying to come up with a plan along with my sisters therapist, but I still need some input...

96,"Hey all, over the past 4 years I’ve been feeling kind of empty and apathetic towards life. I don’t seem to get genuine joy out of anything and when I feel happy it always feels like a fleeting moment. I do well in school and accomplish every task that I set out to do, but once I conquer some ambition, I always seem to go back to being empty and cold. I never take time to celebrate successes and I always focus on what’s coming next instead of living in the moment. I enjoy school because it distracts my brain and makes me focus, but now that I am home on break, I cannot help to feel under stimulated and extremely bored. Boredom is like the worst feeling in the world for me, it makes me feel lazy and worthless. I’ve tried doing hobbies to distract me and hanging out with others but that doesn’t seem to help. I can never really relax and I always need to be doing/working towards something. My friends say that I can’t vibe or live in the moment, but even in social settings, once I get bored I detach and disassociate. I feel as if I have so much anxiety and I worry about things all of the time, but I never feel physically anxious. I tried seeking therapy, but my therapist pretty much told me I was normal the first time around, but I don’t really feel normal. I go through moments of feeling really good, followed by moments of feeling terrible about myself. On the bad days, I lay in bed for half the day. I am not suicidal or anything like that, but sometimes I feel apathetic towards life. Like I would never jump off of the ledge, but if somebody happened to push me it would be whatever. 

I am writing this in good spirits, after spiraling for three or so days. I wanted to reach out and see if anybody had advice or similar experiences. I’ve been thinking about reaching out to my family doctor and inquiring about medication, but talking about this stuff is really challenging and scares me to an extent. If anybody reads through this, I appreciate ya and I look forward to hearing your responses.",08Dec2020,1
97,"So a few days ago my parents made me leave a bunch of country rp discord servers. This may seem kinda idk weird for me to be upset about, but these things were like 75% of my human interaction in a day. I was very time invested in a few and I made some friends that I would talk to quite often. All of this has been ended by my parents being afraid I would like, tell these people where I lived or something. And now I basically talk to no one and I'm mad every time I log onto discoard to talk to my 1 friend. Also I got really mad for about  hours after I first got told to leave them and wouldn't talk to anyone out side of discord, so that was an over reaction.",08Dec2020,1
98,"     So my sister is 28. She is living with me and my parents, she has been able to graduate from uni, isnt married, has never had a boyfriend, has a job at a retail store,hasn't been able to start her buisness, doesn't own a car or apartment,has no friends (atleast not in person) and is constantly being reminded about how behind she is from all her past friends and all of my older siblings. Idk how to describe it but I think for a long time she has been depressed, like she feels like a failure or is going nowhere in life.

     The constant reminder that she is isnt married, doesnt have a boy friend, has a normal retail job, doesnt own a car or apartment,has no buisness, has no friends is always there. She is a very tough cookie, I bet no one else has noticed, since everyone here lives in their own world,but I can tell but every time I ask her if something is wrong she just replies with,""I'm just tired from work"" or ""I'm just sleepy"". It hurts me I can see her hurt. 

     I'm the closest one to her, she mean more to me than my parents, she the only person that accepts me with all my flaws, she even accepted me when I told her I was lesbian, something I know my parents would be disgusted by. She is like my mother,bestfriend,she is my one true family.

     I want to help her or atleast find out what is really wrong ,but I dont know how to approach her by it. How do I approach her on it while not acting Like I already know what's going on without even knowing fully. How do I make her not act tough, I've seen her cry many times, Ive cried with her, but I want her to not act tough for me I want to be there for her, I want to help her any way I can.

summary:I think my sister is depressed that her life is going no where and time is running out, how do I help her out?",08Dec2020,1
99,"Question about handling a mix of serious stuff and light fun stuff in conversation. Emotional regulation etc. I'm sensitive, have OCD and social anxiety a bit. 

When something serious comes up, or if I talk about my feelings, I feel tightness in my chest and a bit uneasy and worried. The friend I'm talking to seems ok and they're on to talking about a fun topic, which I'd like to do too. But I still feel uneasy and worried inside about the earlier serious part of the conversation etc. 

I've done therapy and CBT on it, trying to spot my irrational thoughts, remind myself that it's all good, and trying to let go with mindfulness. But it still is tough, I usually don't feel back to normal for at least a half hour, so it's tough to stay in the present and enjoy the conversation like I'd like to.

Looking for advice or any thoughts on this kind of thing. Thanks!",08Dec2020,1

I’ve begun to feel like I’m not good enough and this is mainly because I have this crush on a girl and I’m afraid that I’ll never get anywhere with her and I’ll forever be alone. Also I feel like I don’t have any friends. To be honest I kinda don’t. I mean I talk to people in school kinda but I don’t have anyone that I would go hangout with like everyone else does and I’m usually always at home. I don’t really feel lonely I just feel like I’m not good enough for anyone and that’s why I don’t have any outside relationships.

111,"Hi, I've been pretty demotivated to study, and I don't talk to anyone at my uni regularly. I isolated myself till my social circle is well, non-existent. 
I can't really find any motivation to study for fear that I'll get too stressed out by studying. The fear of constantly worrying about my grades, whether i read everything, did all the exercises, checked up with lecturers etc etc from past experiences is terrifying. 
I used to be able to push myself through this by convincing myself that I'm doing this for a purpose, to get into a goof uni, and get a good job.
But, i can't help but feel that I'd fail at any job I get and I can't get a good job. So I havent been finding any at all, i didnt even apply to any internships. I'm in my third year. I flunked my second year with a 60 average even though I got a first on my first year. (First year doesnt count towards my final grade) It's tearing me up inside.  
I don't talk to anyone, because I get stressed out. I also get unusually envious of others. I dislike this a lot. Im tired of trying to prep talk myself into accepting that it's okay to see others succeed. So i just decide that if I don't know about it, I won't be stressed out. So that I can at least be friendly towards others. 
My head works in a weird way, the way I think sometimes surprises me and shocks me. Somehow I just feel like I don't deserve to be around people. I am aware that this is self-destructing, but a major part of me doesn't seem to care anymore. 
But somehow, I also feel rejected by others. 
Of course, I just given up on studying sometimes as I just don't want to do anything. I know I should care. But frankly id rather just not do anything at all. 
Somehow, I'm aware that although my feelings gets put down by others, my life is my own. To really improve, only my actions can help mem
But somehow, I just really don't want to do anything at all. I just want to sit and wither away. 
I do occasionally try to join a club or society, but the recent one I join seemed to just ignore me. Whenever a new group gets put out, they fail to add me in. And then they'd ask why I wasnt aware of certain events, well. Firstly, I wasn't notified. I had to constantly check up with them just to be sure that I was even placed in the correct group. 
I emailed them a few times when I can't make it to online meetings as the timing isn't suitable for me as I am studying remotely. The timings are at 3 or 4 am in my local time. Somehow, i get blamed for not showing up, which I fail to understand why. I request that they update me on the meeting contents but they only replied 2 weeks after. While Im just out of the loop. 
It irritates me when they ask me to add them on facebook when we have previously chatted, privately, on fb. Im thinking of quitting. 

Other things just irritates me. I ignore a friend group last academic year because there was a guy there that patted my thigh for the first few times we met. I was so  shocked I froze. He stopped doing that, but I still feel extremely uneasy whenever I see that group, even though the rest of them were pretty good people. I never brought it up with any of them.
That asshole also kept saying why do i study so much even when I was trying to motivate myself into studying. And said that im probably just wasting my time. 

I didnt hang out with anyone after that.
People around me either seem to find my troubles trifling or exaggerated. Maybe it is. Idk. 

I tried reaching out, but felt that somehow they dont really care. And i feel like my worries are stupid. Maybe they are. 

On my family side, i got really upset when my dad had once said "" it's great that you didnt get into **** uni(some top university), because you wouldn't have done well there"" im somehow still upset by that even though I don't want to. I understand that that's his opinion, and maybe he has his reasons for believing that and i should stay firm with my own determinations. But. Honestly, im still upset. 
But theres some truty in that since im just lazying about. 

Well, there's also the time when he randomly choked me, albert for less than 10 seconds, out of the blue, when I lightheartedly said that I really don't want to live anymore. It was in a public space too, and I joked it off, and nothing came of it. It was uncharacteristic of him, because he never did that before. He hardly ever hit me too(asian parenting wise). He also never did that again. Nor did he ever speak to me harshly nor act in any aggressive manner at all since then. 

Idk, these are just instances that really bothers me. They lasted for a short period of time, but still really bother me.

Now This is the tricky part I don’t know if this part is in my head or real I’ve only had the piercing for about a week but I feel like it’s ruining my teeth I noticed I had a small space between my teeth that I don’t remember ever being there I was sure the piercing caused it some how but I went back through old pictures and apparently the space has always been there :/  so now I feel like I might have gingivitis because my gums are sore and bleed easily but it’s only the teeth my piercings rest behind that are affected. I’m pretty sure the not brushing for weeks part has a lot to do with it but I have poster perfect teeth I get checked regularly never had cavities or gum disease and I’ve gone longer in the past without brushing and had little to no trouble :(

I'm a 25f now but the earliest memory of this thing has been since I was a toddler. Its actually hard to explain but here goes nothing.
I get this overwhelming feeling that always starts with this awful pain in my eyes. I can't see sharp objects because I feel this twitchy feeling that makes me sick to the stomach. I have to close my eyes but when I do I see everything in sizes which disturbs me so much. Its like everything I see that day turns into size of small medium and large but so fast that it seems like everything shrinks and expands. When that happens my auditory hurts I hear the noise in sizes too so bad I feel like throwing up. If I open my eyes I start seeing a ball of different sizes like a floating ball I can see as if I could touch it. When that happens I feel like my stomach is made of sand that is so smooth but a rock with so many bumps pushes disturbing the shape of the sand feeling all the sharp edges. It gets to the point my nose feels like someone pulled a hair from it and everything smells odd almost like the smell of glitter.

so for a while now, ive had issues with feeling like im not real. for a few weeks last summer it got so bad that i genuinely felt like i didnt exist, and i got really close to ending my life because i couldnt find a reason to keep living in a world that wasn't real. its gotten a lot better since then, but i still struggle with my own identity and still kinda subconsciously feel like im just a background character in a shitty video game.  
most of the time i can ignore it, but its been getting really hard recently because i cant even look at my hands without getting incredibly uncomfortable. it feels like they're someone elses and im not supposed to have them, they dont fit right. occasionally this even extends to other people when i look at them too long. it's really hard to focus in class sometimes because my teachers will suddenly look alien and wrong, and it scares me.  
ive tried to look this up on google but havent really found much, ive read a bit about depersonalization/derealization and i feel like if anything it would be that but it doesnt feel entirely like the same thing? im just really confused and kinda scared, i feel like its been getting worse and i dont want it to get really bad again. i dont have access to a therapist or anything and reaching out to my friends isnt really an option because they all have their own struggles and mental health issues and i dont want to drag them down.

117,"I caught someone on camera stealing a part off of my car in broad daylight today. What is worse is that I recognize the car from a neighbor that lives in our condominiums. I am already on edge about my job and my life. This somewhat broke me today. 

I have been robbed of my sense of security at home when I worked so hard to avoid the fear again of someone stealing something from me here. I have lived in this condo for over ten years. After several thefts I decided to get cameras that could look out for me since I was constantly looking outside my windows anytime I was home. I had a son two years ago and slowly the fear diminished where I would only check in on the cameras sometimes at night. 

I have been struggling with depression and self worth to the point of wondering if it is really worth dealing with me anymore.... my two year old son helps me along and my husband is a saint but I simply feel guilty that I am not present.

I have a high demanding job and bury myself in the work. However the business I work for is falling a part, and I feel guilty for those failures. My husband takes care of our son so that I can catch up on my work so I can be present when I’m home, but it never ends. If I try to shut off work I am still not there and actively present.  I am always so beyond stressed out, mentally exhausted, and checked out. I can’t take a day off because I am in a position that requires me to lead but I haven’t been able to check out since the first of last year.  Because the business is failing we have had to stop all of the projects I have worked so hard on that would have improved so many things. However only I and two others are aware and I have not been able to announce what is going on so I am still having to pretend that things are in motion and okay. I am a constant duck in water but since in am in a lead role have no one I can really share these thoughts. 

Before my son was born I was in working for a larger company and held a more prestigious title/position but the depression and self harm was present. I was close to ending it but reverted to cutting because I was so worried what people tonight around me. I would also drink to pass out and would take pills to see if I could end it that way to no avail. Finally I thought if I left that stressful toxic environment I could make things better. 

My son has a lot of medical problems so much so that I took out my hard earned 401k from the last decade and have had to use them towards medical bills. I don’t make what I used to at this job and am frankly underpaid but always thought that my hard work would eventually pay off. I purchased this condo when I was barely twenty and live in an area where property value is outrageous. If I move I worry about the bills and my husband supporting if I lose my job or if I am in a position to take a break again like last time. 

I am feeling so small, pushed in a corner, and defeated.I failed again and I am falling harder. However since having a child I have not been able to resort to the self harm that I previously used to partake. I feel that I am nearing an eruption. 

This event today has sent me over the edge where another bad thing has happened and I don’t know if this fight is worth it. I have wrapped myself into this mess and haven’t  done anything to change. I am spiraling....  I feel so terrible for my husband and son but I really don’t know how much longer I can do this. I am beyond overwhelmed with life and underwhelmed with me. I can’t manage all of this and need a break (again). Having a child makes it so much harder to pretend to smile through sadness.  

Even posting this makes me worry that someone will see this but frankly I am at the end of my rope and I’m slipping. I wonder seriously if my husband would be relieved that he doesn’t have to deal me with me anymore. I can’t really say that anyone else would really care.",08Dec2020,1
118,"I recently went through a breakup. First and immediately it was shock and pain from shock. Then it was confusion and self hatred because she had tried to act like it was all my fault, I was even googling like “am I a Narcissist” Then it was calm for a bit when I hung out with friends and reflected on the relationship and realized I wasn’t a horrible person. Then I was numb for a while or what I thought was maturity, I felt okay with all of it and I thought I knew what I wanted for the future, and I felt okay and peaceful. Then a few days ago my OCD just went insane and I started feeling miserable about it and things started bothering me that didn’t bother me at all before, things I THOUGHT I had come to terms with. And the other night it was so painful because of all the thoughts and I bawled my eyes out. And now i’m in this weird sadness/ocd/idk if it’s hormones or what stage. Because maybe I’m about to start my period and that’s why it’s all suddenly bothering me? Because I genuinely thought I was doing better. And now it’s all painful right now. And I feel calmer talking about each thing which is what happens with intrusive thoughts, the more I get it out the less it bothers me. Idk, I’m confused because all the breakup articles don’t usually cover autistic people or people with mental illness. And in my case it’s both, and I’m also not in a great home situation so it’s like she was the person who would help me through it and now I feel weird and lonely, but idk.

So I don’t know if I was in a numb stage or if my PMS hormones are kicking in and making me feel bad or making my OCD worse. Because usually people don’t feel happy in a numb stage, and I did.

120,"I've always been the sensitive kid when I was younger and would cry if i got a bad grade(even a B) and my parents were constantly overprotective and wanted me to be the successful one. Now i think that could be the reason why i'm overly emotional and an overachiever. I'm fine with the overachiever part, but this overly emotional part of myself is making me really stressed and i just don't know how to fix it, i don't overreact or lash out (so i can control my reaction to the emotion),  but the feeling is still there.

My girlfriend and I were friends for 2 years and decided to start a relationship just 3 months ago, and I get so emotionally hurt by the simplest things that i know shouldn't bother me ,but they do. For example(this time i couldn't control my reaction), i was tired and wanted to cuddle (asked her 3 times to come and cuddle) ,but she had a shit day and wanted to be left alone, so i got kind of angry and left (this i couldn't control as i felt like shit and didn't want to stay and let her see me like that).

121,"I don't really know how to describe this feeling, it's hard but I'll try.  It's just that everything got boring, I'm constantly tired and I just don't enjoy doing things I used to love wholeheartedly. I just can't manage to do anything, I just sleep most of the day off, I get extremely mad at myself because I waste so much time sleeping, or just doing nothing, but my body is just uncapable of even getting up in the morning anymore. I'm always tired, along with constant headaches, I just lost will for everything. I don't really go outside anymore, or contact anyone because I'm too tired, and I feel like if I say things they will judge me behind the screen, probably laugh at me. But, whenever I do something, my mind makes me feel extremely bad about it, for example if I'm making breakfast, I feel like someone is watching me, judging my every move, bullying me and preparing to hurt me for doing something wrong. So I just stop, I freeze in place and stop everything I'm doing and just leave everything because I'm too scared of doing things wrong, or being watched. And whenever I need to do things in front of people, my heart starts beating extremely fast, to the point it aches. My hands, and feet go cold and I start shaking, sweating and heavily breathing. Because I'm scared of people. I kind of stopped showing my feelings, or emotions, or opinions, because people will use it against me, and take advantage of it. I'm just so done with everything, kind of to the point I want to end my own life. I don't know what to do with myself, I hate myself so much it's unexplainable. I just want to tear my body apart and start with a new one, I can't stand my own reflection without feeling ashamed and disgusted. I don't know anymore.",08Dec2020,1
122,"Hello,

I just want to say that I'm not particularly underweight or overweight, technically for my height I'm a very healthy weight, which is why I'm not that worried about this at all.
But my closest friend is quite worried and said my bad habits will ""catch up with me@ and I already know I'm not being healthy so I thought I'd see if I can get some advice.

You see, I struggle with eating a lot of food. A small dinner is enough to make me start feeling full and sick and that's probably because I often ONLY eat dinner. I just don't get hungry during the day. I forget to eat usually but it feels like it's becoming a choice but I really struggle to break it. I can't eat lunch and because of my mental health I struggle getting up early enough for breakfast. 

Occasionally I'll have something during the day but usually it's just my dinner. I know this isn't good and I try to get better but my eating habits haven't changed in weeks now, and my friend says that of course I'm full faster because I'm starving myself.

I really don't know what to do. Ive tried drinking more to try help the habit come back to eat more but that's not worked yet, though I'll still drink plenty now anyway. I feel sick sometimes thinking or looking at food and I'm starting to really dislike my own body because it feels full and bloated after 1 meal, which doesn't help my self image at all.

Any advice at all would be so helpful! I just don't want to get sick or get into worse habits where i'm not eating at all or anything. Thank you for reading!

124,"i've been having a lot of contradicting? i guess? thoughts lately. 

let's start from the beginning. i'm in my first year of college &amp; im on the pre-med track, which is something i really want to pursue. anyway, sometimes i feel really active and ambitious. like, in the beginning of the semester, i was so proactive with all my work and extracurriculars. but i've gradually just kept declining as the weeks went by. since everything is online, it's super easy to just not care. i can do work while still getting good grades, and i've stopped going to club meetings online. i used to use a planner but i haven't even used that since early october. my emails are piling up day by day. i used to get good grades, but i literally got a d on my last chem exam.

frankly, i just don't see the point in doing any of this anymore. but it's not like i want to die, you know? i just wish i was gone from everything. like, from my school, my friends, my family, etc...

everything is just so messed up. i had surgery three times in high school, it messed up my grades pretty badly but i still graduated with a 3.6/4 gpa and entered a pretty nice uni. my relationship with my mom is so confusing to me, it has been since before i entered high school. my sister thinks everything is a competition between us and she loves to make snarky comments towards me about the way i look or how she's a better daughter than me. i'm able to separate my work from my personal feelings whenever i first start something, but then it ends up worsening as time goes by. basically, i just get lazy and stop being ""on top of my game"" if you know what i mean. then i start to get focused on things like my hair, my weight especially, the symmetry of my face, and clothes. 

i can't tell if i'm just being whiny or not. am i being overreactive or overthinking everything and making excuses for my overall poor performance and attitude? my parents don't want me to go to a psychiatrist or psychologist because they think things in my records will affect my acceptance into med schools and future job acceptances. i'm still going but i also want to know if this is actually true lmao

but is there anyone out there who might have gone through the same things or knows what i'm talking about? am i just being a self-entitled brat? i don't understand what i'm going through, but it's been like this for a while. i thought a fresh start in uni would do something but i'm just repeating my behavior from the last four years...",08Dec2020,1

127,"I wanted help to deal with something but I couldn't bring myself to ask for help because I felt like there are so many more people with more pressing problems, and in comparison what I need help with is not that big of a deal. 

Exams are going to start soon and I know I need to study and I can, but whenever I try to, my parents distract me by yelling at me or at each other, and then blame me for never taking the effort to study and do well on my tests. If I lock my door, they take my computer from me until I do whatever it is that they want me to do. It stresses me out and I really tried talking to them about it. I told my father that I don't like being yelled at all the time and that it's overwhelming. It did help for a while, but my mother began to yell at him as well so he stopped supporting me. I tried to tell my mother as well, but she got mad at me for it and was passive-aggressive at first but went back to doing the same thing after a couple hours. I can't deal with all of this and pressure from teachers and others around me to do really well in all the tests. Even if they yelled occassionally, it wouldn't be that bad. But every few minutes, (even right now) they start yelling and it's really difficult to focus when that's happening. When I'm outside, my mother calls me and begins to cry and tells me she never wanted me and she must've done something bad to have me. When I'm at home, she starts to cry and sits beside me and if I try to comfort her, she says I'm a curse but when I don't do anything, she hits me. 

To avoid this, I decided to study at night but my mother refused to leave me at home and if I asked for space she yells at me even and says it's out of concern for my well being and she doesn't want me to lose sleep. I also tried to study at a friend's house, but she kept calling me on my phone and if I didn't respond, she'd call my friend or her parents and then yell. Sometimes I go cycling and I'd see my father following me because my mother asked him to.

I know they're doing all of this because they care, but it's too much for me to deal with. I started to cut again, and it's not really helping. I really want everything to change, but I feel like it never will and the only solution now is to deal with all of this until I'm done with school.

Why the hell can't I just fix this psychosis?(seriously)",08Dec2020,1
135,"Hi all,

I'm a 27yo male whose mental health has taken a slight downturn during lockdown - with growing insecurities and anxieties that I've never felt before. Before I begin, I *am* going to counseling, but even though it's helped, I don't feel like I'm there yet.

The reduced social contact all of us have experienced this year has brought about a change in me I didn't expect. Though normally I'm confident &amp; happy, through lockdown I've developed insecurities which though small at first have started to take a hold of me, change who I am and hold me back. Unfortunately most of these are of a social/sexual nature - so please stop here if this is an uncomfortable topic for you to broach (I was considering putting this in /r/relationships but didn't think it would be appropriate). As a bit of context I broke up with my first girlfriend of 2+ years just before everything kicked off in Feb/March - it was break up I instigated and don't regret.

Initially this insecurity was just ""I'm not social enough"" or that ""My social group isn't big enough"" and this was really easy to understand as everyone was probably feeling something similar to some extent. Though, it was more about looking into the past around my late teens or early twenties and feeling like somehow I'd missed out, that I didn't have the full experience that others had had - not that there is one defined experience. I know this is all irrational, but it's how I felt. Gradually this feeling got stronger and stronger and this core belief that I'm less than others reared it's ugly head. This led to me using other people's (different) social experiences to justify why I'm less than them or why they have ""it"" while I don't.

A couple of months further down the line and this exact same negative thought process got applied to my sexual (rather than social) relationships and this is the one that's really beaten me up. Though I'm generally in good shape, good company, am popular and have a lots of friends, I've never been one to always have a sexual partner or girlfriend on the go. And this has never bothered me historically. I've always been comfortable with who/what I am and my limited number of sexual partners. But now this has changed (I hope not permanently) and I'm comparing and despairing when I (as before) compare my experiences to others. Again, it manifests as looking at people who've had lots of sexual partners/experiences as somehow better than me and have something I don't. They've got ""it"" and I therefore place them on a tier above me. Often this happens when talking to my close male friends who I've grown up with and, bar just a couple, have all had many sexual relations ranging from 50 - 150. In the past this has never been an issue, but now I feel inferior when compared to my closest friends who I've been so close to for so long that they're virtually siblings. One further example that has been bothering me a lot: I have a 50 yo female friend with whom I'm very close - it's platonic - but we often speak about her youth and I can't help but feel like I'm just so inferior to the kind of people she'd have partnered with in the past - again, not that I'd want to partner with her as she is now. She's had more sexual partners (14) than I've had (3 - and lost my virginity at 22) and she comes across as someone who is/was very popular and desirable and I hold myself to those standards and find myself lacking. Even when she talks about the odd fling here or there I can't help but think ""why can't I be someone's fling?"", ""Why couldn't I have had that impact on someone's life at that age?"" - It's all so irrational and odd. I don't feel desirable even though on paper I have no reason to not be and I wonder what's wrong with me and why I don't have ""it"". I've been waking up at night incredibly anxious and angry at myself, lots of it related to this idea that somehow my past sexual experiences were inferior and now I won't get them back and that despite being only 27 I've missed out for good, leaving me as a person with ""lesser"" experiences, indefinitely, and that I'm a lesser person for having such lesser experiences.

I've worked myself up quite a lot writing this, but I can't shake this grey cloud of inferiority and inadequacy looming over my head every minute of the day and night - this worthless, undesirable, inconsequential person who's defined by his (perceived) lack of quality experiences.

I appreciate this is a very long post, so if you've read this I'm incredibly grateful. I'm looking for opinions and thoughts on this. Again, I am going to counseling and we have made progress despite a recent dip.

Thanks again.

**TLDR:** I've spiraled into a mindset where I invalidate my own experiences and compare and despair with other people's experiences, considering myself inferior to others because I didn't hit some kind of expectation of what I should and shouldn't have done at certain ages. This is predominantly around my sexual partners and because I've only had a couple, I'm inferior to people who've had more.",08Dec2020,1

This project has received ethical approval.

Hi, my name is Nicole Dawson, I am currently completing a masters in clinical and health psychology at the University of Liverpool.

I am conducting a research project into the factors that can help or hinder recovery from psychosis in parents. This research is important as it values the opinions and experiences of the parents themselves as the service user is seen as the expert in their own recovery. Moreover, this research can be used to inform health professionals and clinical settings on how we can best support parents with psychosis on their recovery journey. This research has received ethical approval by The University Of Liverpool Ethics Committee.

As of the situation with COVID-19 all interviews will be carried out over the phone or using applications such as Zoom. All participants data will be kept anonymous and confidential. If you would like to take part the following eligibility criteria apply:

You must speak fluent English and be between 18-60 years old.

You must have experienced psychosis during parenthood, this may be or may not be include a formal diagnosis.

You must be in a period of recovery and have been recovered for at least 12 months. You MUST self-identify as currently being in a period of recovery, and have had no significant intervention or crisis intervention from mental health services for the 12-month period. This includes community treatment orders, and any period of hospitalisation for mental health care. This does not include routine medical appointments, such as medication reviews or clinics.

TL;DR

Living abroad with my family in a foreign language country, being a miserable father and husband. I can't seem to understand/deal with my older child (6yo) and feeling helpless after doing a therapy sessions.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this doesn't get too long

My wife and I are together for the past 17y and we move to a foreign country almost 4 years ago and we always had a life of respect. Our first child was around 3 when we moved, and as they grew up they started to be less flexible when doing or being asked for things.

On our first year here I've lost my father and couldn't be present at the funeral as it happened too fast, I had a breakdown after a few months and started with therapy sessions, which helped me on taking the pressure out of my chest, but never helped me on getting other aspects of my life addressed.

I used to play video games, and had to put it back to the box as I thought this could be one of the potential causes for me behaving differently with my child - I don't seem to have the patience to deal with her, and whenever she confronts me I will lose control and will scream.... You can figure out the rest.. Crying, more screams, wife comes into the play, screams at me, we fight, my child(6yo) says that want to be away from me for the rest of her life and so on.. None of the fights has physical aggressions of any sort towards them or myself - But the arguments hurt for them selfs 

I started to &gt;!harm myself!&lt; in different ways as some kind of penitence or anything like this every time I would make her cry. I brought this to my therapy session, but it's just ridiculous that I was left with little to none support. 

Because of this I stopped with my therapy sessions.

I really don't like to see my child crying or arguing with my wife because things I do. I try to do my best on not exploding, but is out of my control... It just comes

I'm not sure if I'm venting or seeking support.. I'm at to the point that I really don't know where else to go. My head is spinning and I'm starting to get afraid of myself. I'm feeling completely helpless, and I don't see a good future on this, but at the same time I can't seem to find anyone to help me",08Dec2020,1
138,"I'm 20 and through my entire life I have never had positive male attention not even from my brothers or my father. My real father left when I was a baby. My step father was an alcoholic, my oldest step brother was a drug addict and the other older step brother sexually abused me. Which made me think that I deserved it. 

I have never been the typical beauty standard. I never had a small doll like face with flawless skin. Never had a tall skinny body nor a curvy Beyoncé body.

I have never felt attractive without even mentioning desirable. I have just always been the ""ugly one"" or the ""average one"" in my high school. 

Now I have a boyfriend (24) he has a very high standard of beauty and he's with me. He told me before we were in a relationship that I'm a 6/7 and totally not his type which obv changed now because he loves me but I still don't know how to feel about it. Especially sine he's  genuinely attractive and I feel inadequate to be his gf.

I feel horrible because I always ask him if he finds me pretty and it annoys him because for him the answer is obv yes. But I personally can't get over the feeling that he's lying. I think that every man in the world could tell me that I'm pretty or beautiful and I would still think that I'm ugly.

I'm constantly scared that my bf will leave me for a beautiful blonde. I am so insecure that I even hate it when he calls my mom pretty because I feel like he's making me compete with her. And when he says an actress or a girl in my class is attractive and that happens to be a blonde... 

I immediately feel my jealousy going through the roof and tell him if he likes them that much he can go fuck them/ be in a Re with them. He jokingly replies with ""ok I will"" but I don't think he understands how much that hurts in the moment. He obv tells me then that I'm being irrational and that he'd never leave me for someone else but that fear still is there.

And before you ask yes I've talked with him about it multiple times. Idk why I'm that insecure because I know that I've grown out of the high school ""ugly duckling"" phase and honestly I hate myself for it. I always fake such a confident woman and I always fake not caring about beauty standards and being pretty or desirable. But in reality I yearn it as much as being loved.

Nor does he show any sign of getting help when I've begged and cried. I play unpaid therapist a lot.  Its taken its toll. Also I  was so committed that I didn't bother making close friends in college and I have no friends from high school anymore.

For context, I am mentally ill and disabled : I'm autistic, have several learning disorders, GAD, social anxiety, traumas, and I suspect an undiagnosed mental illness because I have some very bad anger issues, mood swings, s-h tendencies that I don't think are related to what I've been previously diagnosed with. So obviously, all of these are barriers to my studies as I get tired more easily, I have special needs, and I have to cope with my mental illnesses and disabilities in addition to the pressure and expections from my studies that are very high, because I am a pre-med student.

I'm overall a good to very good student, I've always been, despite my mental health issues, but I must say, my methods of coping weren't the best in middle/high school. I would basically overwork myself until I have a mental breakdown, panic attacks, lay down for a week, then repeat. It wasn't the best but it's all I could manage by myself as my psychiatrist at the time was shitty and of no help. But obviously, this can't work in pre-med. I can't possibly loose one week worth of work every now and then because I would have pushed myself beyond my limits. Problem is, I don't know how to manage otherwise, I don't know how to cope with my symptoms better than ignoring them until they get overwhelming, the pressure of the exams allows me no break and I can hardly rest properly. In consequences, I struggle to feel motivated at all even though being a doctor is my dream job and I think it really starting to have repercussions on my work.

142,"depression caused by dentist visits
Hi, I have anxiety but I have not been diagnosed as depressed. I just have constant depressive episodes in the days leading to and after dental treatment.

I have really bad teeth, I was never told to brush as a child and I had a really bad dentist who even as a child never injected me with anaesthetics, did extractions and fillings which completely traumatized me. I put off going to the dentist completely after I was around 10 and only at 18 I decided to maybe take care of my dental health as I saw my yellowy and crooked teeth were just making me really conscious of my smile

I met with another dentist to whom I explained my past resistance to dental procedures and in the beginning he was kind, confirming every step if I wanted him to stop, allowed me to play music so I could put the smell and sound of drilling behind me.

around 6 months later, since after I've had 3 cavities filled, decided to get braces since my dentist recommended them saying it was due to the crooked nature of my teeth I kept missing spots and I also thought it would be good for aesthetics as well.

But my dentist wasn't as nice as he used to be. I had 3 extractions since then for braces but then I wasn't allowed to play music or distract myself in any way. If I wanted to stop his assistants would hold down my arm and say that it's okay it'll be over soon. Even the anesthetics were only availble for extractions. Ever since then it's been a traumatising experience, at the beginning of the treatment I discovered that I have an impacted canine stuck due to my milk tooth not having fallen off. He recommended surgery which would pretty much involve tearing open the part above my mouth and my dad said I wouldn't be able to handle that and put it to rest.

Since then everytime there's something or the other which is wrong. I am tired and unhappy and cranky all the time. Not to mention dental treatment isn't covered by my parents insurance and it's so expensive. Every time I leave from there and cry. Today I went in for my cleaning (which is painful because my gums bleed) and found out I have yet another cavity due to my brushing habits and another extraction for a tooth to allign my teeth. I also have to get my upper braces put. I have exams next week and a month later another major set of exams

Life just seems so bleak. I just can't handle this anymore...I've lost my will to live and my teeth don't even get better.",08Dec2020,1
143,"Hi all, my name is Hannah 26(f). I have been a full time stay at home mom my children’s entire life (never once leaving them alone with anyone. Literally.) and I am currently struggling; I was wondering if anyone had any relatable moments and/or comforting words.
I’m a single mother  of 2 amazing little girls (3 and 5) and in 3 weeks I will be moving to TN to live with my sister and her husband. This move is very important because it will be the start of a better life for me and my children and such an opportunity for so much growth and happiness. Unfortunately because of my past s&amp;xual trauma, I find myself paranoid. My sisters husband is a great guy, he is so excited to have me and my girls live there and be a positive male figure in their life (which they need) but he will be spending a lot of time watching the girls alone while I make the necessary steps to make our way to independence. (ie. getting a job) since he works from home it is so convenient and my girls love him very much and are soooo excited to have an uncle to play with. But I am fighting with this paranoia that I’ve always dealt with but never had to face since my children were always only in my care. 
Abuse. I would like to preface this by saying no, this is not a “gut” feeling and yes I’ve spoken to my therapist here about it but I cannot shake this paranoia about something happening while I am away, what if my children aren’t safe? How would I know? What if these irrational fears can’t be elevated and I’m always on the look out for something that isn’t there, causing an unnecessary issue in the household. 
Clearly I have been abused in my life as a child, and have taught my girls the things I wish I would have known then. Ex: We don’t believe in “secrets”, only mommy and doctors touch spots, consent (even with just high fives or hugs) etc. but none of these things can stop anything once it’s happened and that has me not in a good headspace. No, I can’t talk to my sister about it, she has never experienced anything like this and gets uncomfortable about these kinds of topics enough without me expressing unnecessary irrational thoughts about her own husband. Also, I don’t want anyone to know I’m having these internal issues that are trying to manifest outward because I am struggling to heal from my own pain from the past (other then my therapist). I will have a new therapist when I arrive Jan 1st but until then I’m stuck in this anxiety cycle and just want to know I’m not alone. Thanks in advance for the kind words!",08Dec2020,1

145,"Hi guys,

So every night when I go to sleep. I have to google to calm me down so I’m not anxious when I’m sleeping because I get anxious about getting up in the morning and feeling all this anxiety and dread.

This morning when I woke up I had an absolutely horrible feeling and straight away I went onto dr google. Worst thing to do and I looked up schizophrenia, paranoia and delusions. Now my issue just now is worried about being schizophrenic and being paranoid.

So this morning my girlfriend told me someone nearly ran her off the road on her way to work and this automatically made me think “what if that person was trying to hurt her or planning to get her” this gave me unbelievable anxiety and made me obsess over it again and again and again. Leading me to look up videos and google paranoid thoughts which tbh made me worse. Every single thing I done I made it relate to paranoia. Below are some examples that I came up with after constantly googling these symptoms and watching videos.

What if someone from the government was out to get me

What if someone is watching me through my laptop

My gran was on a call to her brother and it made me think, what if they are on a call planning to harm me.

What if my girlfriend isn’t at work and she’s just telling me she is

What is people are just generally out to get me.

All of the above I know are absolutely false, although the anxiety that comes with these type of thoughts and sometimes how real they feel is absolutely shocking and it takes me into a horrible state of anxiety and fear. I have been looking this up constantly for the past 2 weeks and honestly I’m terrified I’m going to lose touch with reality and believe all these things. Creating scenarios in my head of what might happen and causing myself even more anxiety.

Does this sound like OCD to anyone? For the record, I know these thoughts are ridiculous but when they come into my head it cripples me with anxiety. I am done with these thoughts now and wish they would just go away but I can’t seem to stop watching videos and reviewing these symptoms of schizophrenia and psychosis 🙄

Any response would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Brandon",08Dec2020,1
146,"When we released a new application - a diary of feelings and emotions, we consulted with leading psychologists on how to prepare it correctly, so that keeping records would be of maximum benefit for our future users. Our goal was to create a modern and convenient alternative to paper diaries and notebooks. But is it possible to replace them completely? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each method? As an app creator, I decided to figure things out on my own.

For a month I had been keeping an ordinary paper diary. Then I used our mobile mood journal. In my environment, some people could barely imagine their life without paper notebooks. On the pages of a diary, they drew, took notes, crossed out what was written, folded the corners, and believed that a mobile app could not replace “live” contact with paper and pen. Other friends of mine used applications similar to ours and claimed that this is a convenient and modern way of taking control over your emotions.

I had a specific goal of journaling: to improve my emotional state, alleviate the anxiety, and learn to understand myself and my feelings better. Therefore, armed with a beautiful diary with a corgi on the cover, I began to write.

## My findings after a month of keeping a paper diary

First, it turned out that I am a very unorganized person: I’ve skipped about two weeks of journaling. Sometimes I was too lazy to write, then there were a lot of other things to do, and nothing special was happening ... Then I started working on a new project and for a couple of days I completely forgot about my notes. Perhaps the problem is in me and I should be more attentive, but I doubt that in the frantic rhythm of modern life it is possible to keep such things as daily writing in your head.

Many people say that handwriting develops creativity. To be honest, it only has made me tired and many of the notes were shorter than they ought to be. I was just too lazy to write everything on paper, so I made short, abstract notes - very often they did not reflect the complete situation.

Surely, I liked my notebook - it has a beautiful bright cover, crunchy sheets with a pleasant smell of fresh paper. At first, it was even scary to make the entries, and indeed, it was unpleasant to cross out the text and rewrite it, for example. I had a feeling that I was spoiling a beautiful, new thing. Moreover, it was inconvenient to take the notebook with me everywhere I go: I chose a rather large one and it didn't fit well in my bag. This means that I could not write down the thoughts that came to me in the office, for example, and by the evening I had already successfully forgotten them.

Well, in general, I’d like to note that I am not a professional psychologist and do not quite understand how to keep a paper diary properly, so for me, it turned into a bunch of stuff without any system or connection. It was difficult to analyze them, and draw conclusions. Feeling a little upset, I proceeded to the second month of the experiment and installed our application - a diary of feelings and emotions, that had already been released by that time.

## Why I liked using the app

I will be brief: for myself, I highlighted the following advantages:

**1. Always at hand**

An unconditional plus of mobile journals is that they are always with us. You can forget your notebook, it may not fit in your bag, but no one will leave the apartment without a smartphone!

This is particularly relevant for those who are just starting to keep a diary of emotions - to accustom yourself to make notes regularly, you need to have free and easy access to them.

**2. Large amount of memory**

Paper notebooks are limited by the number of sheets, and as for the digital ones - they are almost unlimited. In an app you can write, delete, write again and again without any fear of spoiling it (as in the case with paper notebooks).

As for me, when running an ordinary diary, I always had a fear to write something ""wrong"". Also, they end quickly enough: usually it takes 3-6 months to complete a paper notebook. In mobile application you don’t have such problems and it is possible to find old records pretty fast: as a rule, they are sorted by date.

**3. Guiding questions allow you to analyze your emotions better**

In our app, after you choose your mood today, you will receive a series of guiding questions that help you understand which events led to this feeling. This allows you to understand yourself better and find out what events and triggers should be avoided to improve mental health.

**4. Regular reminders discipline you**

The app sends reminders that say it's time to get back to journaling. It disciplines you and develops the habit of taking notes regularly.

Since I have a really busy schedule, I choose a mobile app for daily use: it is convenient, fast, and modern. I have paper notebooks, but I use them occasionally. 

*And what will you choose - a handy app for analyzing emotions or a beautiful paper notepad? I would be interested in your opinion.*",08Dec2020,1

I followed her and she followed me. As I looked through her playlist, I discover that she has her SEX PLAYLIST entitled THE MOOD (she has been with her bf) on it and an intrusive thought popped into me head a couple of days ago randomly. The thought was that she and her boyfriend laughed at me for being a virgin. Because she was my friend I told her about my insecurities and lack of romantic success.

150,Hi. I’m in such a stressful situation right now and I don’t know what to do. I’m having a traumatic childhood and it’s rlly eating me up. I’m starting to feel like I’m hearing other opinions in my head but I’m 100% certain they’re not real. The only option that should be available for my situation is going to live in care but I’m really scared. I don’t want to abandon my mum but I feel as if this will be best for me as I’m really struggling now and she isn’t doing anything to help. Exams are just too much to concentrate on and I’m self isolating right now which means that I can’t escape the situation. I think going into care would be the best option though. It feels as if I’m being eaten up I just want my life to get better. It scares me that I’ll never find someone who truly cares for me as I’ve never had anyone show care towards me as a child. Because of the aggression/ violence I’ve seen (mainly by the male members of my family) I’m scared of men or boys my age. I know it’s irrational and not all men/boys are like that but I will always have these horrible memories. It worries me that one day they’ll never be someone there for me as I come with too much weight that no one would want to carry with me. I know that I’m young and I have my whole life ahead of me but for me it just seems like nothing. I don’t think I have schizophrenia or smth similar as I know that theses voices are probably chatting away because of trauma and I don’t hear them as an external source. Should I just go to care?

Hello, 
I am going to keep this simple. I have had a lot of feelings that have built up and I think now is the best time for me to let it out. Growing up I have felt mentally and emotionally abandoned, treated as if my voice does not matter and treated as if I am a failure and always will be a failure at life. Any chance I had to be with my family I was always happy and when I would come back to you I would always feel the dread of seeing you again because I always felt under appreciated and would never be able to be me with out pressure, or without being questioned for every thought or move I would make. I am going to terminate the relationship we have between us. I would like to continue to live my life as the woman that I am. I will not be talking you and I will not be talking to anyone in the family about us. I also ask that you respect me and not bring anyone in the family into this. I do not ever want you to think of me as a guy. I am always a girl no matter what anyone says. Please do not use other people to be a middle person to check on me and see how I am doing. I am going to be clear with you now, that no one is manipulating me or forcing me to terminate with you. These are my words and these are my feelings, and choices that I am making. I do have a voice and I do have a mind to think with. I have the ability to make my own choices. I have been manipulated by you for so many years and this will stop now. I will not bring this mess into 2021 and beyond. There is too much hurt and pain when I think about you or see a picture of you because I have been let down more than once.  Regrettably, you chose to run away and move far away, for what seemed like you trying to sabotage a relationship that my dad and I have, and you trying to raise me by yourself and not have assistance from the family. I do not like it when you belittle my dad, my grandparents or others in my that you choose to insist that they do not exist. That is something that you have tried to do for years and that hurts, even at a young age you did that to me. No one person is perfect for anything, and I sure as all out am not perfect either.  There are times I am not able to sleep or stay asleep because of my dreams being nightmares, or things from my past bothering me. Those are my problems to fix, and my problems to deal with. I am not going to end this in a yelling screaming match and I’m not going to end this terrible either. Yes you are my mom, and yes I am your daughter(not a guy at all ever again) do forgive you? I can work with that, it will take me a lot of time that cannot be rushed. I will also be clear that I will not be talking to Skip, I choose to not have a relationship with that man. I do not want him in my life and do not want to ever think of him. If anyone, including Skip and your side of the family try to contact me, I will not be answering or returning calls or texts.",08Dec2020,1
159,"hey. i dont know if this is where i should post this. ill see ! 

i dont know how to start. im your average teenage girl. ive struggled with mental health for nearly 3 years now. i have diagnosed severe anxiety and depression. im on and off medication. ive only just started actively seeing a psychologist on my mums request as i started developing symptoms to do with tics and she doesnt like the idea of being seen in public with me like this. thats a little irrelevant. whatever.

ive always depended on a lot of physical things to keep me happy. art and music and media and all that. ive never really considered it healthy but i think its okay. ive never really thought of my attitude as overly obsessive or weird. i just liked things a lot and they make me happy. the psychologist im seeing has mentioned to me that media etc. have played a massive crutch for me while i wasnt feeling myself, and i have to agree. i could be going through a lot and watching a tv show im into or listening to some good music can drag me straight out of it. so i guess theres that.

im in high school so its pretty natural to like people romantically. ive liked two people over the past three years. one girl who did a lot to drag me out of hiding and make me meet people. she was sweet. i liked her through self isolation. eventually we drifted. 

as of right now ive liked this guy for half a year-ish. ive thought he was cool since i met him. were friends. i know im one to overthink, but you know how all these outwardly obsessive peoples stories start out, they didnt think it was anything at first. 

ive just noticed myself getting overly frustrated and disappointed about the fact im not around him or not interacting with him, knowing what hes doing etc. im sure its nothing. its just getting in the way of my life sometimes. i get overwhelmed with jealousy or get so annoyed i start crying, even when i am actively thinking, 'we are not in the kind of relationship that allows me to feel this way', because i know were not. ive found myself constantly fishing for compliments from him, trying my hardest to maintain a conversation with him because i get so desperate to just listen to him talk. theres a lot more i dont have the energy to mention. i  just know this feels wrong. it feels so wrong. 

that aside. he got me thinking about the girl i liked previously. i recounted a few old notes on my phone i wrote about her while i was in self isolation and doing online school. theyre long, but the gist of it is that i was absolutley head over heels for this girl. id sleep for days cause i literally wasnt around her and didnt want to do anything but be with her. i got so stressed when we started drifting i started giving my mum attitude and she made me stay at my dads house for a week. reading the notes i found just brought the memories back to me. i just remember hell lol. it was unhealthy. i wanted to be with her so bad. i dont want to call it obsession but i know it was weird and at times would scare me. again, there was a lot more to it i dont feel like mentioning.

on a lighter note, both of these people have helped me through a lot even though it may not seem like it. my mums a narcissist, ive figured that much. im always feeling like shit whenever im with her. just the thought of the guy i like makes me feel better. the same went for that girl. 

i dont really know where i was going with this. i did some research on hyperfixations/hyperfocus and their relation to anxiety/depression but i dont really know if its a common symptom. i think theres a few things i wanna know.

- would these people be considered hyperfixations of mine
- is it actually unhealthy or have i just never experienced real love lol
- is this something i should be bringing up to the psychologist im seeing.

i say that last one cause its not exactly an easy thing to talk about if you know what i mean 

thanks. i dont really have the energy to write a lot. id really appreciate some help. i genuinely am really scared and do not really know what to do.",08Dec2020,1

# Drinking blocks a chemical that promotes attention

.Norepinephrine release to cells is diminished, causing a cascade of effects.

N a new paper, researchers from The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio), report brain chemistry that may contribute to why drinkers have difficulty paying attention while under the influence.

The work is funded by generous support from the Robert J. Kleberg, Jr. and Helen C. Kleberg Foundation and by grants from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Institute of Mental Health. Findings were published on Dec. 2 in *Nature Communications*.

""When we want to focus on something, or when we stand up from a chair and become active, a brain stem nucleus releases a chemical called norepinephrine.

162,"TW/Suicidal thinking

My mental health has deteriorated to the point where I am almost 0% functioning. Trying to come through what ended up being an accidental serotonin syndrome/toxicity experience that’s now lasted over 3 weeks. It has been HELL. Nightmares unlike anything I’ve ever had, sweating and twisting and wanting to jump out of my own skin. A need to feel pain, inflict violence, rip doors off hinges. Waves of feeling like I am hulking out - uncontrollable strength and violence. Absolutely crazy thinking. Doctor figured it out, and we’ve treated it at home with diazepam &amp; cyproheptadine. All from taking one single antidepressant pill once. My body couldn’t take it, and combined with everything else I was taking for pain, it was too much. All of this was done with doctors and prescribed meds, nothing over and above or bought on the streets. 

My sweet husband keeps looking each morning for a sign I’m feeling better. I’m faking it completely. I am not ok, not even a little bit. This was the very last bit of hanging on I had left. I’m done. 47 years of trauma and depression and trying to figure it out every month - I just want to be done now. I want out. I don’t want to live another day. I only got through yesterday by taking enough meds to knock myself out for the entire day. I would give anything to be normal or functional again, but that’s over now. I live with severe chronic pain that is getting worse month by month, we don’t know all the reasons why. My life now revolves around a duffel bag of medications and timers and specialist appointments and MRIs for a weird brain tumor and migraines that feel like strokes several times a week. Some days I can walk, some days I need a cane. Some days I can talk, other days I can’t find words and I sound drunk. Some days it feels like my skin is on fire, every cell of my body is in pain. Most days though are migraines that bring me to me knees, sick to my stomach and unable to stand or walk or function.  Last week I had one where I just begged my husband to just shoot me to get it over with. This is no life. I would not wish it on any one. 

I am the monster in the house. I am the person my family are most afraid of. That they have to go around and move around and keep away from. I can’t believe it. My job was always the one that kept everyone safe. And now I’m the least safe person in their lives. I can’t bear it. 

I live with my husband and two kids - almost 12 &amp; 15. I’m doing my absolute best (and failing) at not being toxic or abusive or horrible. But here’s the thing. I am gone. Like, the me that everyone knew and cared for is totally, completely, absolutely fucking gone. I had already isolated myself from 98% of people I have known over the last year, cut off Facebook and Instagram, and I almost never answer my phone or texts. My business is gone. COVID destroyed what it had taken me 5 years to build, and it has bankrupted us. I am the reason the house is destroyed, our finances are a wreck, the kids aren’t focused online schooling. I can’t read a single piece of paper and figure out what it says anymore, and get lost just going to the store. I hide from people because they can see the difference and there’s still. I thing anyone can do to help. 

It’s not if one or all of us get COVID, it’s when, and I can’t handle that stress any more. I’ve been the one trying to keep everyone safe, and most recently the younger teen wanted to meet up with some girl she met online from Kentucky to go shopping at the mall - I just couldn’t believe it. She can’t get it through her head we’re not going anywhere or buying anything or seeing anyone we don’t know. All she wants from me is to buy things. That’s it. Otherwise I’m just a speed bump during her day she has to avoid. Now she won’t come near me because I said absolutely not to this out of town girl coming from 4 hours away to hang out. 

Over the last few weeks I’ve been going through the last group, my closest friends, and one by one I’m blocking them, too. I don’t want to know them any more. I don’t want to care about them any more. I don’t want anyone to care about me any more. It’s too fucking exhausting. I’ve wiped out every bit of social media or online presence that I could. The last block on the last day will be my sister, my last best friend, and my husband and then my kids, and then I’ll end it. 

I would go to the psych ward if we could afford it. We can not. I went last year for a week and it made things 10x worse, not better, so I truly only feel like suicide is the only option now. I just can’t figure out where and how. All I thought about yesterday was hanging myself in a big tree nearby. I asked my son to hide my car keys. I hid in my room. But now I’ve got to figure out how to get through today and I don’t think I can. 

My dilemma is it has to be so that someone else finds me, and it has to be far enough away that my kids don’t drive by it or live near it for the rest of their lives. It can’t be in the house, they still have to live here. I am thinking of taking all of my pills at once and going far off to a field somewhere and they could use my own phone gps to find me that way. If I set a notice, maybe the police could find me first. That’s all I think about. 

I know they’ll be sad. But I can’t believe that ultimately they’ll not also be completely relieved. I won’t be a burden on them as they grow up and move on with their lives. They won’t have to make choices about who is going to look after me, or where will mom live, or what meds does she need now or what doctor appointments does she need to keep. They’ll be free of all of that. They can be sad but they’ll have 100% of their lives for themselves to do with as they wish. 

I can’t believe they won’t be relieved. Relieved not to have to tip toe around the monster in the house.  Husband will eventually move on and find a nice wife, someone sweet and uncomplicated who wants to watch Netflix at night with him. Kids will move on eventually, I’ve got no hope they have any happy memories left. If you ask them now they don’t remember anything good we’ve ever done - none of the road trips I took them on, or day trips, or crafts, none of it. They think their entire lives have been shit. They don’t have any memories from before I got sick. I can’t believe it. 

I love them but now feel it was totally and completely reckless and irresponsible to have had children, there’s no way they will ever stand a chance in the next few years from the economy and diseases and the climate - especially if they have to factor me or my care in to it. I fucked up. It was selfish and self centered to bring kids in to this awful world. I really, truly regret it now and all I feel like saying is how sorry I am to them over and over. 

I used to go to therapy every week, send inspirational texts to my friends every morning, wrote uplifting things, blah blah blah. I devoted my life to being a good person who gave back in every single way I could think of. I was a community hub, always a place to get a free meal or winter coat, or a hug. It was all for nothing. All of it. You can’t make yourself in to a good person when you’re still a monster inside. Eventually it all falls apart and the monster is all that’s left.",08Dec2020,1

167,"Using Mental Health as a shield to hide behind for criminal and hurtful behaviour.....

Repeating hurtful choices is just that – a choice. A nasty pattern of behaviour is not something that should be allowed simply because someone has a mental illness.

Blaming bad behaviour on mental illness comes in many forms.

A person will say something offensive, and others will come to their defence by mentioning their mental illness, as though that gives people a free pass to hurt others.

Or someone will use mental illness to excuse their own behaviour, accepting hurtful choices as just part of their illness or using their illness to justify their poor treatment of others.

The reality is this: Mental illness is not a free pass to be cruel, offensive, or to engage in toxic behaviour.

If you have a mental illness, you cannot justify persistent cruelty as part of your disorder, and if you’re in a relationship with someone who’s treating you horribly, you don’t have to put up with it just because they’re ill.

Of course, there are disorders that cause mood swings, anger and irritability – such as bipolar disorder. But it’s a personal choice how you react to these emotions. Do you get help the moment you do something you know is wrong? Or do you expect everyone else to simply accept the hurt you’re delivering?

If you find yourself lashing out of people, that’s something you need to fix. It’s something you should seek help for. It is something you should acknowledge. You should not allow it to continue happening just because you think it’s part of the parcel of mental illness.",08Dec2020,1
168,"Male (anxious attachment) 
Female (avoidant attachment)

(male perspective) 

We met each other while fresh out of damaging relationships/traumatic experiences. I had a bit more healing time than her. She ""chased"" me. It took a couple of attempts until I invited her to my place and we cuddled all night and didn't have sex for the first month of the relationship. The beginning months were classic honeymoon period. We fell in love during covid. Love brought our triggers and attachment styles to center stage. She first said she's falling in love with me after 3 months, then she got scared from her own emotions and backpedaled and said she didn't know what she wants. This triggered my first wave of anxious attachment, which then triggered her avoidant attachment. We made it through this stage and she called me while working at the island she goes to every summer. We were apart for 3 weeks and she said she wanted to be exclusive. I overthought this and viewed it as her approaching it from a controlling perspective, not from the perspective of missing me and wanting to be together. She then invited me to the island. This was the first time we spent over a week together. Inefficient communication led to both of us being triggered and her asking me to leave the island early, without any possibility for discussion. This served as a large trigger and made me feel very unloved and pushed away. When I returned to the city we normally live in together, I said that it is probably best for us to not be exclusive, because I was worried that us being exclusive was triggering us too much and that we were better off appreciating each other without labeling it. This was counterproductive as it led her to believe that I was seeing someone else/that I did not want to be with her. This increased her avoidant attachment and only gave temporary relief to my anxious attachment. Weeks later was the first time we told each other that we deeply love each other. I brought up some talking points about our relationship that triggered anxiety within her, as she does not want to talk about any aspects of the relationship or ""work"" on it. She only wants the relationship if its ""good"" and ""easygoing"". This led to my first deep realization of her emotional unavailability and that she is scared to be close and intimate with me and that she is constantly hot/cold which is very emotionally draining for me. We ended up taking a ""break"" for a couple of days which organically ended as we came back together. Since then, there has been more ""tiptoeing around"" /walking on eggshells because I realize that we are ""good"" when I don't talk about emotions or just don't ask anything of her. This leads to a very unfufilling and exhausting  relationship for me although we love each other and through the traumas and triggers we see/ believe we are soul mates. It is counterproductive to mention my thoughts/ feelings because it has triggered her/ caused her to shut down, especially when I add any emotionality to my communication. I have made one recent breakthrough, and that is when I showed her an article ""10 Signs You Are Emotionally Unavailable"" which clearly described her behavior/ actions in the relationship. She responded very favorably to this after reading it by herself. Now my days are filled by constantly thinking about us and her as I am worried about how she responds/ if this makes her shut down/ detach more from the relationship. In general she is open to counseling and so am I. We were wondering what we can do in the short term to understand how we both interact in the relationship and how we can heal and thrive together. Any advice is greatly appreciated. - With Love",08Dec2020,1
169,"I've grew up in an abusive household. My mom used to physichically and mentally abuse me and tell me there is something wrong with me all the time. She would send me to exorcists (because im queer or because im goth) and would never care about my accomplishments (she didnt even go to my high school graduation and neither to my graduation of my law bachelors). Every time she didnt agree with me she would tell me ""you can't have an oppinion on that, you're autistic"". (before i was diagnosed)

Im very litteral compared to the average female. When i started going to the college people would call me autistic a lot (they also did it in high school, but in college way more.) i did always aknowledge that there is a big chance i have some less heavy form of autism like aspergers.

I started going to the psychiatrist 3 years ago. I got diagnosed with ADHD and autism (aspergers type) at that time. They put me on aderall and this worked very good for me.

One day i wanted to experiment with some MDMA, this was 2 1/2 years ago. The experiment went wrong and i ended up in the hospital (nothing serious, just an small overdosis). My mom was there, and she told the doctors that i have a bad reaction on aderall (which didnt even make sense since i was already on aderall for months back then) and demanded them to get me off aderall and restart the diagnosis with more specification. She also told me that going to church will fix everything and that i shouldnt take those meds because ""god doesnt want to"". 

For the past two years, i've had different iq tests, different mental specification tests and development tests. They finally had the diagnosis ready today after 2 years.

I talked for a long time with the psychiatrist and she explained to me that i obviously have ADHD.

Then she told me ""for the autism spectrum; 3 years ago i wouldve diagnosed you with aspergers syndrome. But we work differently now, we only diagnose people with autism when its very needed to and when it actually bothers other people and you. I think that nobody would be bothered by some of your autistic treats and it even gives you adventage sometimes because of your intelligence.""

then we talked about the treatment for ADHD.

In the end of the conversation, she told me, almost like she knew that i needed to hear it: ""you're an amazing person and there is nothing wrong with you.""

I kindly told her to have an good day and we ended the teams call and i started crying my eyes out.

I've been told my whole life that i will never get somewhere, that i should be like everybody else and that there is so much wrong with me.

I never knew all i needed to hear is ""there is nothing wrong with you.""

Last time i cried this hard was when my grandpa died 3 years ago. God bless this woman. She littarly fixed my 19 years of being surrounded by mental abuse by saying 6 words. I also realised i've never heard those words before.


For the only 3 people who will read this: Im very sorry for my trashy english (english is my 3th language so grammar and spelling words is very hard). Also if you're reading this and you know anybody on the Autism Spectrum, with ADHD or anything else that is not always accepted by the modern society, please tell them there is nothing wrong with them.

170,"Tw: suicidal thoughts and ideations

Background, I’m in Pennsylvania, USA. Diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety disorder, PTSD and OCD tendencies. 

So, these last few weeks have been in a crisis, with passive suicidal thoughts, and we have been safety planning and doing all that and I’ve been spoken to about going into the hospital voluntarily multiple times or doing php/iop. So far I’m just out here vibing with my depression but now it’s turned a bit more active so of course therapy last night was a train wreck and I almost got 302’d. 

My therapist, wife and I did come up with a safety plan for the night, and she did tell me I almost got 302’d which is literally the last thing I want. My whole care team want me to go in voluntarily but honestly I’m scared and don’t know what to expect. I took off work today with my last sick day of the year, and my therapist set me a goal of calling HR to find out if I can get disability so I can get more intensive care for my mental health. She is going to be calling me tonight so we can discuss what I found out and safety plan for tonight, then tomorrow I meet with my psychiatrist, so I’m still not out of the woods of getting 302’d. 

If I go into a psych ward is rather go on my own but I’m terrified. I guess what I’m asking is - what’s it like? How long did you stay? Did it help? What do I even take with me? What happens after? 

I’m scared.",08Dec2020,1
172," The guy disrespected my property during this one time when I was in a classroom. I was looking at a video, called ""How to get a girlfriend"", and minimized it to look at colleges when he came up to me. In front of me, he put his fingers on my laptop, pulled up the video, laughed at me, and then told some classmates.

He has also done other mean things to me too, such as taking this embarrassing picture of me without my consent and distributing it with people, and laughing and saying that the whole school had it. He also said mean things to me here and there as well, calling me things like ""bank robber"" and ""school shooter"".

For some odd reason I never interpreted it or even registered any of these as mean things. I don't know why, but I never even picked up on the fact that this kid did something really mean to me. As a matter of fact, I was never even bothered by any of his words/actions. Now I'm looking back and wondering why I didn't react to that, but for back in the moment I never even realized that someone was being mean to me, both in the moment it was happening and any time before quarantine really.

But now, as I'm looking back, and I have more time to think about what happened, I'm starting to realize that what happened was not right and very mean. The dude is a jerk, no doubt about that.

I was never really afraid or intimidated by this person either.

But I'm wondering, just out of curiosity, why is it that I never picked up on his meanness in the moment it happened, but rather a year later?

Why can't I just pick up on this stuff right away? Why the delay?

And how normal is it for people to not pick up on stuff like this in the moment it happened?",08Dec2020,1
173,"  

Hello Guys,

I would like to talk about a subject that i ignored for such a long time because i thought it didn't matter, and here i am today finding it difficult to live everyday life like a normal human beign.

So the story started when i found a job on internet working in Facebook as a content moderator, the job seemed cool as they didn't mention anything in the job description,and the salary was pretty decent, i was a student in my last year in university an i needed to support my studies, so i applied for it and i had a chance to take a part in the recruitment process.

The interview was really weird because they asked me about my opinion in different subjects like, Religion,Politics,Porn and suicide etc ...

I'm a very skeptical person and it helped me pass the interview,and we had to move to training, During the training they started to show us Horrific videos of Gore and Terrorism and Nudity, some people couldn't stand those images and videos so they started to Puke and Sweat, as i never saw those videos before my body started to react but i had to bite on my tongue because i needed the money to support myself, and they fired everyone who was flinching during this process.

The training was more focused about how we can be a real life heroes and protect the Platform from this content, they even asked us "" Would you like your Child to see this content on Facebook?""

When we moved to production then real shit started to happen, i was working 8 hours on a night shift focused on my screen watching, posts,videos,Imagery about ( Hate Speech,Graphic violence,child explotation,Terrorism,Suicide and self harm,human traficking ),and all those TRAUMATIC stuff human beigns can imagine.

I always finish my work at 8 AM and i feel like a Zombie seeing people enjoying their mornings, and i had to go to sleep which i found huge difficulties falling as sleep because my mind was just proccessing all the stuff i had to see during the night.

After the first couple of weeks,sleeping seemed like a kind of war because my mind was not convinced that this shit is really happenning in the world.

One day someone suggested that smoking weed can help with sleeping because it stops the REM phase, and in that day my Marijuana addiction started, Marijuana was my only friend in that moment because nobody understood what was going on in my life as my perception of the world changed from a happy WORLD to a very Fuckedup place to live in.

We used to Work for MENA market mean all Arabic speaking regions as i am from (Casablanca,Morocco), the subject that we had to deal with a lot was terrorism because we can speak Arabic and understand all Arabic dialects. We were forced to watch Full videos of Gore,Child Rape,Nudity,Suicide live and self harm etc...

I wrote this article on behalf of all people working as content moderators because this subject is really neglected and nobody knows what is happenning in our lives, this job is addictive, they know how to keep people productive with their manipulative trainings.

As i read an Article that Facebook is Paying all Content moderators who are suffering from PTSD, but this action doesn't Include people in other countries and specially third world countries which is UNFAIR, those people were responsible of dealing with Terrorism because we were the only people who can understand the language and we have some Market knowledge.Our workspace was full of people suffering from mental illness due to the exposure of this content but we remained silent till now.

This job gave me an overall view about the subjects that the media was promoting( MASS BRAINWASHING ). my pattern of thinking changed and i see that everyone needs help.

I'm really suffering here because now i don't know how to get back controll of my life and, if i go to sleep without getting high i just dream about all the shit i saw.

I'm thinking about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as it seems the only way to go through this, but i really wanted my message to be heared.

174,"Hey! I've been here on the subreddit a bit. Have posted vents here and there... 
So.. I'm (14, Something under the non-binary umbrella, born female) diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and diagnosed as Highly Sensitive person (HSP). Lately I've been failing at school and now alot of tests are coming up. I study. Alot. Trust me. 
But now, a day before those tests, that basically determine wether I have to repeat the year or not, I have intense anxiety which has caused me to throw up, be dizzy and just overall feel like crap. 
I even had a nightmare.
I had 4 options: A, B, C and D

A: Write the test, throw up blood and die
B: Write the test, fail and have the teacher beat me to death
C: Skip school, mom discovers I lied to her about going to school, she beats me to death with her heels 
D: Pretend to be sick, actually become sick and die.
(super unrealistic, they wouldn't do that. And I know they wouldn't but oh boy what anxiety does.)
I chose A but the option ""glitched"" and became worse.
I wrote a test, in a torture chamber with a black shadowy figure infront of me that looked both like my teachers and parents. I failed the test and everything went blood red. I then died a painful death.
I woke up, screaming whispering ""I didn't want to choose that..."" over and over. I was shaking like crazy. 

Anyhow.. How do I deal with this anxiety? I can't take it. I don't want these stupid nightmares. 
Any advice..?
Other than therapy, that is. I started therapy a bit ago.

Note: My anxiety is already triggered by simply entering a bus or going outside.",08Dec2020,1

176,"I can’t explain it, I just, I feel like I’m going insane. My mind has felt incredibly off balance lately and I have days where I can barely get myself out of the house and then days where I can’t stop talking to people and NEED social stimulation and say and do things that are reckless (with money, sexual stuff and just conversation in general) and I regret the next day. I don’t have days of just feeling comfortably normal. It’s either one extreme or the other

As for recent stressful events, my boyfriend broke up with me about a month ago which really fucking destroyed me but I kinda forced myself to get over it. He is still in my life and we are good friends and I no longer have romantic feelings for him to the extent that i did, but we were together for almost 2 years and I’m 18 so those are some of the most formative years of my life yano. 

I have no idea who I am without him, so I’m assuming my anxiety and fluctuation of moods is my mind trying to figure out who I am. It’s hard for me to develop new meaningful relationships because I feel like an imposter in my own mind and I don’t know how to behave because I don’t know what is natural to me. Call it an identity crisis, anxiety, trauma from the breakup but I can’t stop feeling like I’m going crazy. 

I am trying to find rational reasons for the way I am feeling but the only one I can think of is the recent breakup. However, on the surface it doesn’t really affect me bad enough to trigger what I am feeling so I don’t really think it is the breakup. Maybe it is my subconscious reacting to losing him? I don’t know... 

I am open to advice and questions, Thank you for taking the time to read.",08Dec2020,1
177,"I know this is something everyone feels, but it’s one of the few things that I haven’t managed to make much progress on for a number of years now. Maybe it’s just the reality of living with social media, but I just feel so overwhelmingly ashamed of myself when friends/acquaintances/people my age post about an achievement. 

I don’t like reacting this way. I know I can talk my way out of it, and I don’t actually *think* the way I *feel*,
but I still can’t seem to get rid of that initial gut-punch reaction. It shouldn’t be about me. I should be able to feel happy for them first, and then think about myself second. Somehow, though, it always seems my reaction is “how come they can do that and you can’t? why didn’t you accomplish *thing*?”. I have had to delete certain apps off my phone for months at a time, or have just forced myself to avoid certain apps if I’m not feeling mentally prepared and am nervous to see something that will deflate me for the day. It is easier when the achievements are on the fringes of my skill set (something I can do ok but not really well), but anything important to me is super sensitive territory. 

This year has been particularly tricky as I didn’t get into a program I wanted to get into this past September. It was something I was prepared for (getting in on your first try is honestly like 60% qualifications and 40% luck) but I am surprised at how sensitive I am about it still three months later. Anytime I am in contact with someone who did get into the program, I have to be SUPER careful to tiptoe around my own feelings, and I just wish I could feel happy for them without feeling bad about myself. It’s like that super cliche meme “I was a high achiever when I was younger and now anything less than The Best feels like a failure”. It’s stupid, and I know I am just a person with strengths/weaknesses/limitations, but I get so mad at myself if I am not remarkably good at something important to me. And it’s not about feeling like I “deserved” something, but rather like I am useless if I didn’t manage to achieve something. I don’t scrutinize others or look down on them for the same things that I tear myself down for, and I wish I knew how to give myself the same acceptance and understanding when I can’t do something. And the weirdest part is that it 100% hinges on comparison to others. I can accept my own struggles and failures if I just consider myself (independent of others), but as soon as I compare myself to anyone, all that logic and self-compassion/understanding goes out the window. 

Overall, I just feel guilty for getting upset. It makes me feel selfish and childish, and no matter how long I sit there and try to reconcile with my emotions, the initial sting still persists longer than it should. I’ve worked through a lot of shit over the past few years, and have managed to curb a lot of my other harmful/unhealthy thought patterns, but this is one I just can’t seem to make much progress on. My solution now is to just keep my distance from social media as much as I can, which is probably avoiding the problem rather than addressing it.

If anyone else feels the same, or has any advice, I would really appreciate it. I just want to be genuinely content at not being The Best™️ and still being proud of myself.",08Dec2020,1

186,"I often find myself ruminating over upsetting or embarrassing moments. I can sometimes get lost in it for a while. I'm not sure when this started, perhaps in the last year or so, but I sometimes find myself (internally or out loud to myself) cutting these thoughts off with ""I'm gonna kill/hurt myself"" when I have no intention of doing so. It makes the rumination stop, often, but it's just odd to be doing this without much understanding as to why.

 I recently discovered I fit most criteria for OCD, but to my understanding one must demonstrate compulsions too (As it seems that 'pure-O' isn't a real diagnosis, in that some sort of compulsion comes with these obsessions even if they aren't so noticable, apparently). I'd say I have some sort of compulsions around other unwanted thoughts that come into my head, but it's terrifying to talk about. I'm scared of speaking to anyone about most of those thoughts.

Is it even worth me seeking an assessment for OCD? I have bigger fish to fry where mental health is concerned - struggling with trauma from the past couple years, so I'm not even sure if it makes sense to approach this before dealing with that and seeking a PTSD assessment. I struggle, like many, to feel like my problems are 'bad enough' to justify seeking help, and knowing waiting times just makes it harder to prioritise.

I know I have generalised and social anxiety, but I have felt for years that there's something deeper that's affecting my ability to handle myself/ what the world might throw at me. It feels hopeless because as soon as I have the chance to sit with a psych I would often go blank, and I felt like bringing in paper with what I want to talk about made it look like I was faking.

So what I remember from last night: it started in the kitchen, my dad was on the phone with one of my teachers and tried to make me talk on the phone, I freaked out (terrified of talking on the phone/confrontation/ getting in trouble) ran to my room to cry in peace. 
It was embarrassing because my dad was telling my teacher everything that was going on with me, I mean I guess they need to understand what’s going on with me but I feel like he could’ve like asked or something but he just shares my personal things with whoever he wants. 
Anyways, my dad was trying to talk to me from outside my door but I was too far gone into my panic. I was laying on the floor, hyperventilating, scream crying and scratching up my face and hair. Then my parents bust into my locked room and are like just watching me have a meltdown on the floor, saying things like “you’re 18, stop acting like this” “look at yourself” “look at the way you’re acting” “how could you treat us this way after everything we’ve done for you”. 
So I’m just screaming “get out” on repeat, they don’t, they get more mad at me and my mom came up and screamed in my face “SHUT THE FUCK UP” I literally screamed out of fear and curl into a ball and kept screaming at them to get out. That replayed in my mind all night and I’m still thinking about it now. I don’t like swearing, it’s so aggressive and it really scares me sometimes. 
They left, my dad said something bad about me in the kitchen or something cuz then my parents started arguing and my mom slept on the couch. My older sister came in my room and I was still screaming get out, she tried to rub my back and make me feel better but I freaked out even more, I hugged myself against the dresser I was laying next to so tightly and started screaming “don’t touch me”(I have a problem with being touched in my everyday life idk why). 
Um yeah, after that everyone went to bed and I just cried on the floor. Eventually my brain was so overworked or something that I forgot what I was crying about, I fell asleep on the floor. I woke up idk how much later and it was 1am, I had a pounding headache, my whole body still felt numb/tingly, and I was feeling super nauseous. Ran to the bathroom cuz i had stuff shooting out of both ends. I have small panic attacks kinda regularly but I can usually handle them quietly on my own, I’ve never had a panic attack like that. 
I usually feel a little out of it but that whole time I was having my panic attack and after I woke up, I felt like I was going crazy or something, nothings real and nothing matters. 

I either want to kill myself (yes, I’m on medication for depression and anxiety but nothing seems to be working) or I want to drop out, focus on my mental health, get a job, and work towards getting my ged. My parents say neither of those are options, that there’s no excuse for not passing. 

They always say that they understand and stuff but they DONT!! They think that if I just put my mind to it that I can “overcome” as my dad likes to say. My mind is fried, clearly nothing is working correctly up there. 

I know this is super long and probably doesn’t make a lot of sense but I really hope someone has advice or something, literally anything. I’m so lost.",08Dec2020,1

I am thinking of going to the school counsellor, but I honestly need to know if there's anything wrong with me, because I need to feel that all this confusion I'm going through is justified, and that I'm not just blowing this out of proportion.

191," 

I've had issues with some overwhelming symptoms that I didn't understand were part of a mental disorder. When my pdoc suggested it was of that nature without diagnosing me it made me feel a bit better that it didn't mean I as a person was bad or fundamentally broken so it almost made me feel happy to know that I wasn't alone and this thing existed. The past months I've still had these issues, sometimes had them worse/better and I've talked with trusted friends and loved ones about the disorder, the symptoms and how it correlates with mine and that I might possibly have it or just have tendencies. I always reiterated that I'm not diagnosed but I hadn't previously felt bad about talking about it and didn't think I may be adding stigma to people that struggle with a diagnosed disorder that is probably much more severe than my symptoms.

I have been feeling ashamed lately and I finally pm'ed my pdoc to ask about it (I don't really need a diagnosis because I'm already medicated/able to be prescribed medication for another diagnosis, I just want to stop talking about the disorder if I don't have it) and I just want to finally have a definite answer about this. Regardless I've never said I have this disorder (I have said I'm sure I must have it which I feel shitty about) or would post about my mental health online but I feel like I'm one of these people other people hate. I've talked about potentially having it a lot with 2 people because I was constantly dealing with similar symptoms and now I feel bad and like I'll have to reveal to everyone I actually don't have it and will not be allowed to talk about what i'm dealing with because it won't make any sense outside the context of the disorder itself (and before I knew it was even part of the disorder I was scared to talk about it because of how easily it could have been misinterpreted). I feel like this may be a case of self diagnosing and I feel like a horrible person. Can people share what is appropriate and what not?",08Dec2020,1

194,"I think this might fall under grief but I'm not sure. I spent a lot of time last night and this morning thinking about the inevitable day that my grandparents will die, and the pain of that experience. I imagine the same about my parents to. And I feel so upset and that I don't ever want to see it happen. 

I know it's unavoidable, pain is a part of life. Death is something we all have to reckon with, this is normal. Grieving is normal. But obsessing over losing things or people doesn't feel good or normal to me.

I spend a lot of time thinking about friends that I've lost touch with, I left a religion when I was a teenager and lost a lot of things and people that basically formed my entire childhood. I feel great heaviness when I think about never getting to see my childhood home or church again. (even though I despise organized religion lol) I just want to be in those spaces, smell those smells, I feel so out of touch with myself and my past that I would give almost everything to be in a place where I can remember what it was like to be younger again. 

I feel so depressed when I think about this stuff, and I think I end up thinking about it more when I'm sad or scared. I've never really been able to afford the luxury of therapy for reasons that I don't care to explain, but this stuff just hurts. 

I miss my old friends so much. Those ties are broken, I've spoken to almost all of them since we grew apart but nothing ever really came of it. Those memories aren't there anymore. 

Do you guys ever just get stuck missing the past and fearing the future? I feel so bad sometimes that I just end up wanting to disappear, and that I don't have good things to look forward to, but harder times the older I get. I feel weaker and sadder as I age, not stronger. I feel more numbed and tired, not prepared to handle grief of my own or of others.",08Dec2020,1
195,"so. 30F. hi. I'm really stuck right now and could really, really at least use the assurance that someone else knows what this is like. 

I have this problem with self-trust that I've been becoming increasingly aware of, but my awareness doesn't necessarily mean I always feel or think the same way. I've been in and out of therapy since I was 7. I don't know what made them put me into counseling. my grandmother had suggested it. That's all I know/remember. I've been misdiagnosed with bipolar. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety (GAD/SAD). I was bad enough at one point to have a psychiatrist label me agoraphobic. I've had a psychiatrist and another professional that works with kids on the spectrum suggest that I have undiagnosed ASD. 

But on reading up on CPTSD (which is something I was unaware of)... I actually felt pretty connected to that. I have episodes where I just FEEL absolute humiliation/mortification as a response to nothing that should have triggered that *in the moment* I have ""dissociative episodes"" (I think) It seems that way from the description... they're these really confusing moments where it almost seems like I ""woke up"" even though I was never unconconscious... and suddenly I get very disturbed and confused as to what is going on or why I'm here and I feel like my partner is a foreign object and that everything is just this strange construct and I feel kind of like I'm inhabiting my body rather than being a part of it. 

When I think about my past and current situation (as it pertains to trauma/abuse) it's... very complicated. I have a lot of resentment, but at the same time I just bought one of my biggest ""abusers"" a hoard of presents for the holidays... and I still see them pretty frequently and despite the fact that everyone once in a while they send me spinning into a suicidal fit, I try to speak to them in a friendly way and speak to most other people about them as if I understand them. But I don't. I hate them. But I try to please them. But I understand that hating them is wrong. But they tell me I'm the abuser. But I've been told that's an attempt at gaslighting. But I feel guilty. But I'm a burden. But I want them to not exist. But I would hate if they were gone. Etc Etc just this jumble of thoughts. 

When I talk about my past or how current problems affect me, it's like I'm telling a story about someone else. Or, at least, I feel emotionally disconnected from it. But I feel numb a great majority of the time. My emotional reactions are almost always related to my anxiety now.

But the thing is, I was told that victims of trauma are often not self aware like this. And sometimes I feel like actively asking for help means that I don't need it. I used to adamant my deny help. I hated therapy. But now I feel like I might really want to try in earnest. Does that mean I'm fine? Or that I'm just making shit up? I constantly second guess myself. Is nothing wrong? Was my past/present normal? Am I too sensitive? Overexaggerating? Doing it for attention? I second guess myself like this in every area of my life and I'm just so confused. Like. My whole life I've never really been attracted to other people. I realized I might be asexual. But I have thoughts telling me I'm not and that it's not real and that it's just an excuse to not have sex because I hate my body. I have loved and have been with other women both emotionally and physically and I still have a voice telling me that I can't be pansexual/panromantic and that I just want to be that way for the sake of identity or attention. I feel completely disconnected from my ""identities"" and the more I type this out and the more I think, the more disturbed I get. I've had absolute confused crying fits over this.

But I'm aware of this confused turmoil so am I just doing this to myself? is none of it real? Like one passing comment by a professional telling me sufferers of trauma don't know these things about themselves was so deeply triggering I now feel wholly artificial and frantic. My chest has been tight with this like... pre-panic anticipation all morning.

What's even wrong with me. Something must be or this wouldn't even be a thing going through my head. I just... don't even know how to get diagnosed right. I can't find help. I've looked through my insurance and tried to get a referral through my GP... no one called me back. I keep doing this and reaching out and nothing. I'm afraid I'm going to lose the motivation to seek help because my anxiety just hates dealing with this shit and I don't know what to do. My issues go beyond this and really upset my life and I just want to be better. But wanting to be better means nothing significant is wrong...? Or knowing myself... Or. Should I just stop? Just stop thinking or talking about it? Logically I think ""obviously not"" but internally or something I'm also like ""why bother. you're just being a problem. you know nothing will come of anything you do or say regardless.""

200,"This year 2020, I'm trying to become a better person and have been trying to improve myself every day. I've been working out, studying hard and applying for jobs. I've just been focusing on the present and never looking back.

However, this new internship that I joined started off with an icebreaker presentation between the members and it brought back things that I've kept repressed inside. All these other people in my group have impressive resumes with a shit ton of volunteering experience and extracurricular activities under their belt.

I, on the other hand, don't have anything whatsoever. My past was just full of abuse, being an outcast and suicidal episodes. And every time I try to talk or write about my past, anxiety, and depression come along with it. My turn to present for this is due 2 days from now and I don't know what to say or do. 

Talk about my future plans? I'm just living in the present and trying to stay alive and become a better person each day. After all the shit I've gone through and all the dreams that died, I know much better to ever hope again and have dreams so I don't have a topic on that either. 

Talk about my passion? I don't have any. I'm just a workaholic. Just studying and working hard to pay off a shit ton of debt my parents handed down to me since I'm the eldest. I do play games but even then, I do it for the money. For example, grinding hard in Dota and Csgo events for items to sell back. The moment the events are over, I stop playing.

Now with all this put into text, all I could think of is I'm trash. I don't have anything that stands out. Will I even get along with these people? I can't believe I'm having a panic attack over something so trivial.

203,"Hi everyone! Hope you’re doing well.

I wanted to make this post for so long. I always typed out my thoughts but never send them, because I thought I was being dramatic. But my head really hurts from everything that is happening right now. I tried those free listeners some websites offer but they just tell me to talk to the person who worries me (as if I didn’t..) get some help or call the police or just really bad advice in general.. So maybe reddit could help me?

Anyways, I have this thing that I can’t really shut up, especially when something looks wrong to me. I care too much, I’ll admit it, and it ruins my life. For example, I tried to let my baby sister sleep, she’s really small and I would die for her, but she wouldn’t sleep. My dad said “I’ll handle it” and just shut the door. He screamed at her saying “Go sleep! Now!” And I broke down. I don’t know why. It just hurt my feelings. Why would he scream to a toddler? She doesn’t deserve that etc. I think it hurt me because I get yelled at everyday and I don’t want my sister to have the same. I went mad at my dad. But then my parents got mad at me for caring and that I had to just let it. I’m not the parent so I had to let it go. But it just hurts me. Everytime I argue with my parents or just with anything at all, I always get the blame and nobody listens to my side. This example is not a good one about not being heard, but I don’t want to make this story too long. Whenever I do get the chance of explaining myself, telling my parents I want therapy, telling them they hurt me mentally, whatever reason, they tell me I am doing this to myself. That I’m the reason of all of this and when my dad or someone else gets mad at me, I have to learn to accept that they are wrong and I should just shut up. That’s what my mom said. I try to listen to her but it doesn’t work. I can’t control keeping things inside me, I can’t see something happening that is wrong and being silent about it.   
Another thing is, my brother and dad are very sexist. Very hurtful. First of all, HE WON’T GIVE ME PRIVACY. Second of all, my brother will simply hit me if I annoy him too much and my dad will just agree and say I asked for it. He didn’t mean it or it was just a joke. Just a push. And I can’t believe they accept that. My dad will comment stuff like, didn’t you have enough snacks? Guys don’t like fat girls so watch out or if you gain weight now you can’t lose it. Even though I once lost 10 kilograms in one month with eating just 500 max everyday because I wanted to lose weight. My other bigger sister joined me and she lost her period because of it. It triggers me when he says stuff like that and he won’t stop if I mention it. Whenever I get really really mad I hit or shout. I don’t want to admit it. But it’s bad that I do. But again, it’s hard for me to control so if anyone does have tips on that, please share. I just feel so overwhelmed with everything. Even school sucks because  I used to have so many great friends but suddenly all of them went away. I’m stuck with people I don’t like (that are sometimes racist, rude to me, are shocked when my grades are getting better or don’t believe me when I’m sick at home) but I don’t have another option (I mean I probably do but the year‘s almost over so I just try to hold on till I go to university). Anyways. I also went to my teacher that is assigned to help your class (if that makes sense, like a listening ear). I told her how I felt sometimes and she was silent for a long time. Thinking of a reply. And it didn’t help me. She told me I shouldn’t care about others and she told me she kind of didn’t believe I was sick at home. She said she appreciates honesty so I could always tell her the truth. Well I was sick of people not understanding me. I was sick? Anyways I’m really trailing of but I had to get this off of my chest. I also got my first panick attack a few weeks ago, I never thought I would and it hurt me so much. It was because my parents were mad at me and my brother too I can’t remember why but it was not a valid reason I’m sure because it hurt me so much. And even if it was, when I was shaking and hyperventilating they told me stop crying like that or I will slap you. So I ran to my room looking on the internet what was wrong with me. I tried to look for ways to calm down. I felt so so so weak at that moment. I really feel mentally drained out by everything.   


I hope someone can tell me what my problem is. I really want to stop feeling like this. My siblings don’t have this problem and I can’t understand why. Does caring too much cause all this pain? I always try to be as nice as possible but I guess it just hurts me more. I don’t know what to do anymore. Please can anyone help me and I really hope someone read this because honestly this is my only option right now. And thank you for reading everything this must be alot sorry.",08Dec2020,1

-

Needless to say this year has been a roller coaster of emotions. I think the isolation from COVID made things worse for me. This year I am attempting a career change, after having faced too much uncertainty in my previous field and leading to a ""failure"" of some sort. So uncertainty and lack of control is kind of a trigger for me and makes me really anxious. 

I'm currently in grad school to get a degree that will help me shift towards the new field. I'm already unsure about whether or not I'll be able to make the switch since it involves a lot of decisions from their end, and I know I can't control that. But it is the end of the semester right now and between team papers and team project presentations, I feel like I am also not in control of our groups performance and I'm stressing out about my grades. 

To add to that, there are big changes that my supervisors are making on my thesis project and I'm barely involved in those discussions as more experts of the field are getting added to the team, and I keep bumping into issues with different people requiring different things (be it ethics approvals, permission to access data and whatnot, which are all becoming roadblocks to the progression of my project). 

I keep trying to put things into perspective in an attempt to calm my nerves: I'm pretty certain that I will not fail my classes but I probably won't do amazing in one of them. My thesis project will get done, and we're just in a difficult bottleneck time, and I'm getting a lot of support from the supervisors teams as they too, want this project to succeed. 

But it's been months that I'm feeling more and more anxious and sad. I haven't been diagnosed with mental illness but I am quite certain I am depressed. I see a psychological counselor but not as often as I wish, and I feel guilty for reaching out to them or anyone because I feel like it's tough enough for everyone to live their lives and I'm just dumping negative feelings onto them (meanwhile that's what I'm doing now...)

I haven't stopped crying on and off since yesterday. I feel like my chest is full of stress and sadness and yet it won't come out at once. I don't know what to do anymore and grounding techniques/deep breathing only help a little bit while I'm doing them. 

I have one more paper due tomorrow and my project is on halt now because of the previously mentioned roadblocks. I just want to spend a few days not thinking about school, my project, my degree and my future. I want to be a slump and just try to find things that make me happy and do them.

I just spoke with her the other day about sending my prescriptions to home delivery and she told me she sent both. Once again, she only sent the SSRI. 

Now that winter is here in the northeast, I’m concerned about my mental health as I always struggle with anxiety during this time of year and this medication had really helped me control anxiety attacks and nightmares. I’ve always struggled with validating my feelings and my experiences so I’m trying to be an advocate for myself but at this point I’m wondering if I should just suck it up and give up on trying to get my medication back.

Fast forward to this fall semester. For other reasons, I applied to another school to transfer. This was a huge step for me and is something I’ve wanted to do for a long time. The only problem was, I would have to stop seeing my therapist.

Next week is my last session with them. It did not really hit me until yesterday. I could not stop crying, during and after our session. I’m also dealing with an eating disorder, so it just made me feel worse.

I’m going to seek treatment at an eating disorder recovery center, but I feel so lost and upset that I will never speak to my therapist again. We talked about this and how upset I am, but I just cannot stop crying. I feel like I just get too attached to people who show support because I never had it growing up. It doesn’t help that my only two good friends (whom I lived with before transferring) live on the opposite side of my state. I did not realize until now that my therapist is the only person I talk to besides them, and I don’t know if I can survive without them. 

If anyone has any tips on how to get through this grieving process, it would be greatly appreciated. Even tips on how to stop crying lol",08Dec2020,1
209,"Lately i have been catching my dad saying to my sister to never become like me. The most recent occurrence was when after i showered i went to check if i saved a personal project and my mother came in and yelled at me to do my late assignment without letting me explain myself. When i went into the living room i heard my father tell my sister to never be like me. This stung like a bullet.

I am starting to wonder if my grades are determine my value as a person. My parents say they are proud but I'm unsure anymore. Part of it is me being on screens. I think they think my only motivation and interest is screens. I have other interests but they are very social and due to covid I cant do them. What i have decided to do is to just stay off screens as much as  possible. Even if this means i barely get to see my friends anymore and do something i enjoy.

216,"Hi,

If anyone will read this whole post, you must be really bored. It's just about how much of a waste of space I am but I'm still looking for that reason to keep going. Just can't find one.

I'm a depressed 23 year old and I see no point in living anymore. I was doing a few things for my future, which was Scandinavian studies (finishing my masters) and a programming course, and I failed at both. I haven't got a job, I'm looking and sending CVs every day, but due to corona, or lack of skills, I cannot find anything. 

My programming course was an independent online course I payed (or took a credit for) a shit ton of money for, but then my depression got really bad in August and I got really behind, not having the energy to get out of bed. Now I'm so behind that to finish it I have to buy more access, which I have no money for.

My Scandinavian studies degree was going alright until I found out my semester paper I wrote was not long enough so I failed the class and can't take the exam. It said max 5000 words, so I wrote 2700. They said it was supposed to be minimum 5000 and it's a fail. Could have done more, yes, but the week of writing I decided I wanted to kill myself and it was really hard to do that on its own. I had to call the emergency number and talk to them coz in the end I really don't want my mom to suffer losing me. Anyway, I feel like I'm just making excuses for myself writing this, that the lack of energy when I can't get out of bed is just my fault. Somehow I wrote this post. But at the same time it's like the last try at finding a purpose?

I found out I probably failed my semester at uni yesterday, and that was the last thing that was going well for me, even though I live in Norway now and that degree wouldn't give me any jobs here. I'm on exchange this semester which means if I fail, I fail the whole year and have to pay back my grant I got for this semester which is 1700 Euros. I don't even have money to pay my rent. I'm still writing an appeal to that failed grade, explaining the situation, that I misunderstood, but I doubt it will work.

I have no friends left, everyone I had in the beginning of 2020 left me, due to just simply lack of contact or coz my depression put a strain on those relationships.

Honestly, writing this feels like I'm just making excuses for myself. I don't see any point in living anymore, I was still trying to get out of bed, eating, doing some exercise a few days ago but now it seems completely pointless. 

Any ideas on what I could come up with as a reason to actually do stuff? Coz I honestly have no clue. All I can think of is if my appeal to rewrite that paper and take my exam doesn't go through, I will just end my life. I will find out in a few weeks. Until then, I see no point in getting up every day.

  I have grown up with rather strict parents. Being a model student throughout Elementary and Middle school, they came to expect very high grades from me, and i was punished when I had bad grades or was struggling in school.  


On to the vent.  
This is my second year of high school. Because of what I mentioned above, I am in all honors &amp; AP classes. For those who may not be aware, an AP course is a college-grade course provided to high school students, which depending on the college, can be used credits in college if you pass the final AP exam. Because of the Pandemic, all of my school is undergoing online classes. Now, because we have more time on our hands, our teachers overburden us with a lot of work. This combined with the fact I struggle to focus in general (compounded by the distractions that come from working from home) has done a major hit to my mental Health. I have had at least 2 or 3 major panic attacks and countless minor ones. About a week ago, my therapist told me I am going through a depression phase. A day or two after that, I cut myself. I was very stressed and panicked and looking back I should not have done it, but that's not relevant. Fast-Forward to current day, I finally come out about what I did at lunch. My mother's response is ""i don't believe you."" I had to take out a photo from when the scars were still there. Her response was something along the lines of  ""if you do that again, the pain from me will be worse then the pain from your wrists"".

222,"Maybe it'll be a long one. I don't know I'm just gonna get out things on my mind. Please stick with me if you can. So I was born to two PhD students. They're professors now in a university. But it seems that there's a little problem, they never truly showed me love. 

I'm their first child so yeah I'll say that I've gotten some spoiling when I was very young. But that all changed when I was about 3. My father started becoming very short tempered, he'd always lash out on me. I was a very hard child I must say. But the biggest problem is that to this day my parents treat me like a burden, they are the perfect example of horrid parents with all the characteristics too, not to mention that they emotionally abuse me and my two brothers. They seldom showed me any love in my lifetime, I used to try and hug them and they never hugged back, and this led me to be a very loving person and be caring of other people in general. 

But this also led to me being very emotional and I'd tear up when someone shows me the slightest bit of care or love (excluding my parents of course). I've also went through two heartbreaks. The first of which I was left devastated after. The second I didn't feel any pain or sadness. I managed to have an immunity from the past experience. I've managed to completely not be bothered by any circumstance. 

I've grown to resent my parents and eventually become unattached from my parents emotionally. I'm not in a financial state that'll allow me to move out cuz I'm still underage. 

I've just grown to be this cold person who cares for his close friends so much and never gets a fraction of it back from anyone and when I get the slightest bit of affection I literally burst into tears. I don't know. I'm sorry it took that long. I'm just extremely confused and hurt by all of these circumstances but I usually never show it, I've just had enough. I can't seem to find anyone to actually genuinely care or love me. 

And if there is it usually doesn't last long and they just distance themselves from me. And that hurts the most. I just made up my mind that I'm never gonna find a partner. Because they ALWAYS break up and anyone with potential just distances themselves from me. I'm all alone and I don't have anyone, ""the closest people to me""- my parents- do not have a sense of emotion to me and they're just the worst in terms of treatment, heck the narcissistic principal treats me with more respect than they do. 

I'm sorry if I took too long but I appreciate you reading this far and I hope u have an awesome day/night wherever u are. Please if you have any advice for me on my situation leave it in the comments I'll read them for sure. Cuz I'm a depressed cold bitch who's heart feels no emotion most of the times.",08Dec2020,1

This is going to be so long so bear with me. Also, I’m a little embarrassed to put it all out there on Reddit, but I need to get it out and I need to say certain things for it to make sense. 

Background: my biological mother is a drug addict. Growing up I lived half the time with her, and half the time with my dad. I saw some stuff but I feel like I had an okay childhood. 

My dad remarried when I was 5 which was a lot of drama (issues with grandparents) and my stepmom became my new mom. My bio mom got worse and worse and ended up signing over her rights and giving up. This was when I was around 14. 

I’ve always been a “worry wart”. My stepmom is a very blunt person. She says that I’m a hypochondriac, and now even as a 19 year old I’m afraid to tell her of any sort of symptom of anything because she’ll get frustrated and tell me it’s in my head. As you could imagine COVID has been hard for me. Especially because my family still gets together. I have two 70 year old grandparents who I love who we saw recently. Sunday night I felt bad, took my temp. and it was 99.9, so I told my parents thinking they should know since we saw my grandparents recently. Keep in mind that I’m a thin person and my “resting” temp. is like 97.5, so 99.9 is high for me, and I could feel I had a fever. My face was hot, my head felt stuffed of cotton, etc. My stepmom got frustrated and said it wasn’t even a fever until it was 100.4. When I went to sleep it was 100.2 so you tell me. I haven’t felt good and haven’t really eaten so idk if I’m sick or not. I kind of feel like I’ve been gaslighted my whole life so when I do feel something I’m like “do I really feel a headache/warm/sick/whatever or am I making it all up??” It’s tough to deal with. I have some other issues with my stepmom but overall I think she has my best interest at heart.

Now, this semester has been terrible for me for a couple reasons. 
1. I am dating someone who I love so much, but he’s very depressed and has recently been slipping back into some suicidal thoughts/ideation. We’ve been seeing each other for about a year, and up until recently I was always mentally strong enough to be there to help and support him. (Don’t worry, he’s also getting therapy and is on medications, so it’s not like he’s just dumping it all on me as his primary source of support.) however, now with my own issues I feel like I’m cracking. 
My issues: 
2. I have a stepbrother who has low-functioning autism and I love him to death. The pandemic however has taken away his church group, and he graduated so all his sense of livelihood is gone. He just sits in his room all day, and understandably this would make anyone depressed. Autism takes away some social function, but my brother is pretty extroverted and i think this has really taken a toll on him. Now, he’s negative to me all the time. I watch him during the day and he’s constantly huffing and puffing and telling me he misses school over and over and over. I’m an understanding person. I know he misses school, but I don’t know what to say so everyday he gets mad at me. Every single day. 
3. I’ve become so depressed that I don’t care about school anymore. I’m a sophomore at university and I’m actually premed. Before all the pandemic stuff happened I was so passionate about being a doctor. I work in a hospital and at the time I loved it. Now I’m so burnt out my grades are all slipping to C’s and I might actually fail a class. I don’t even care about my patients anymore. 
I feel so much like a failure it hurts. I completely missed a final and had to email a professor begging for leniency. I went to my primary care doctor about two and half weeks ago and he diagnosed me with depression and anxiety and prescribed me some medications. He told me I also needed to seek therapy and start trying to meditate. I have not sought out therapy or meditated. At the appointment I told him that I feel so depressed but I’m lucky to not feel any suicidal thoughts. Well, that’s changed. Within the last couple days that all this has been happening I’ve started to feel .... something. Not suicidal I don’t think, just tired in a way that I wish I could die or sleep forever just to be done with it all. 
I’ve lost all my passion. I haven’t seen any friends since March. I feel like everyone I talk to is a negative conversation, my anxiety has never been higher, and I keep failing my tests and myself. I don’t do anything anymore. I sleep until noon everyday and play on my phone until I HAVE to do some schoolwork for an hour or so. Then I go back to sleep.

232," It's a long post.

I'm a 20y f. I'm currently doing my engineering in computer science. Ever since I was in school Ive always been performing very well academically.  I would almost always top the class. The 10 th grade exams are considered important in my country and I did well in that exam as well. My family was really happy about it. I had lot of confidence and hope that I would do very well in my career. I wanted to study physics and astronomy to be a scientist and I really believed I could reach great heights if I put my mind into it.

When I reached 12th grade I had a fallout, I was feeling kinda depressed because i didn't have any friends nor a social life  and my grades were terrible. I started developing very low self confidence and low self esteem and also had trouble socializing because of low  confidence.  The 12th exams are considered very important here.  I didn't really score as expected , but my parents and friends were happy about my marks. From that day I've been feeling really stupid. I also started gaining a lot of weight(20+pounds) and felt very bad about my appearance.  I felt very dumb, unworthy of anyone's love and ugly. Recently I've been feeling that I cant do much in my life   and I dont think i can do well either in my career or my higher studies. 

Currently I'm doing average in my studies but making small improvements. But I still dont have any good friends I can talk to feel better. Back in school I had a good social life and friends and we would hang out frequently.  
My dad played a higher tuition fee than other students to get me admitted to an engineering course since I couldn't get through merit.  Now I feel that my family too thinks I'm stupid . 

So I have a super rich step cousin brother who got married last year whom I've known all my life but I've never felt like this about them. Since I returned from his wedding ceremony I've been feeling as of I'm worthless and that I'll never have a life like them(I have two step cousins). I never felt less than them I always thought of everyone as equal to me. I've been feeling as if all my hardwork will be a waste since I'll never have a social life like them (they have many friends attend many parties,events etc) not can I do well career wise(they run  a successful real estate business). Moreover my cousin's wife isnt from a wealthy background which makes me kinda jealous of her because now she has a wonderful life too, even though I've never been jealous of anyone. 

A combination of average performance in academics and on top of that gaining a lot of weight has made my social interaction with people very difficult. I feel very inferior to everyone in my class and I'm not able to overcome this issue. I basically avoid interacting with people.

I have lost 12 pounds but I haven't developed any body confidence. I still feel ugly. (I'm not body shaming/fat shaming anyone. I have been overweight before too and have never felt ugly)I have  successfully completed a project assignment still I feel worthless. 
I cry really easily if anyone criticizes me or points out a flaw about me and feel anxious to talk to them for days. 

I want to learn how to stop feeling like this and develop healthy self esteem.

234,"Hi, everyone! I just turned 20 back in November and I’ve been thinking about this topic a lot since I graduated high school. 

When I was younger, I was bullied a lot. It didn’t really stop until maybe 7th grade. And well, from 5th grade to 6th grade, I was being molested on an occasional basis at school. By a cousin. Said cousin also bullied me. 

I grew to hate her, myself, and my body. At age 11, I was going to attempt su***de, but I stopped myself and haven’t tried since. I carried all this with me since then and I’ve only told 2 people I really really trust. 

So my problem is that I’ve been getting so much worse lately. Ever since I graduated and started college, I have been deteriorating. My freshman year of college, I was on BC but got off after a few months so I took that into account. 

But lately, thoughts hurting myself or su***de has been much more prominent like almost every day. I’ve lost interest in just about everything. I’m consistently tired, irritated, I eat A LOT, and my sleep schedule is shit. My grades have taken a nosedive and honestly, I’ve stopped caring about taking care of myself and my life. I only do it so other people won’t worry. 

I want to go and get a professional opinion but I have no insurance and I don’t have a lot of money. I did a lot of research and came to the conclusion I may have depression and anxiety, but I don’t want to self diagnose. I would like to know because I feel absolutely batshit crazy. 

My mom was diagnosed with bipolar when she was younger. She tries to talk to me sometimes, but it never feels like she’s trying to help. It’s just “I can do this so why can’t you?” Or “You’re being lazy. You’re old enough to be able to do these things no problem.” Honestly, I know she means well, but it hurts and I don’t enjoy telling her my feelings. 

Any thoughts on what I can do to cope better until I can get the resources I need? I’m sincerely open to any ideas. Thank you.",08Dec2020,1

But the problem is that over the years i’ve so called “talked” to these characters in my head. at first it was me making up responses but now it’s like there different people. I zone out very easily and what happens is i get so into my head everything blurs out and i can feel and smell but it’s faint and it’s like all the feelings are just ones from my life. I started zoning out more and at the time i had about 6 people in my head so i decided that i would make a world for them. It’s almost like i was a ruler or something. i made a small town and yes all the people have names in my head. The town has a name it has a backstory it has a hospital, police department, convenience store everything a town needs. All of the people who work in the shops have there own names opinions and voices. all together i’d say about 30-70 people in the town and there’s an apartment place. In that apartment place i have a room and that’s where all the characters live. If i zone out it’s like i just woke up from a nap in my room the room is very detailed clothes on the ground fridge the broken lock on the sliding glass door. At first it was normal i could do whatever with the characters but they still talk in my head as well as in the world. Sometimes when i’m not fully zoned out i’ll tell them your not real or something and i feel like if i look hard i see there outlines in real life. I still have very been scared but i am when i heard there voice sounding like it’s from someone in my room. I’ve only heard them in my room about 6 times. All these characters know there in my brain. But sometimes when i’m playing a game or doing something they random pop into my head and i’ll remember a part from a show where they stabbed someone and imagine at me for a second. But when i do that it’s like i feel my heart beating harder it’s strange. Sometimes these characters mock me when i’m sad or angry or they seem like they care and tell me to calm down. they help me calm down but also can make me very mad and it makes me feel like i’m going insane sometimes. I don’t expect any help on here i don’t think anyone will know but if you do it would help a lot i’ll try and answer questions to the best of my ability.",08Dec2020,1
236,"I've struggled with something for years. I need answers, and I cannot find any.

When I was young, first getting into the internet, I played a few games of course and made a lot of friends. After a while, as anyone does, friends became closer. But that is where the road ends for me in terms of online relationships and friendships.

I have never taken a selfie in my life. Googling my full name returns 0 results about me. This is something I have worked towards since my first email address. Why is it that I always want to be so anonymous online? Like a lot of people wouldn't consider this a problem, but its finally hit that point for me.

I've been talking to this girl for over a year now and I've turned down opportunities to meet up and grow our relationship. I want it so bad, but something in my mind tells me ""No."" She hasn't even seen my face, I want to know why I am like this, because now it is affecting my personal life.

237,"Hello i am seeking help or advice/ stories good or bad to point me in a direction to help my mother. My mother is 54 years old and started meth a little over a year ago. She says she isnt a everyday user but she does use. I have a hard time knowing what is the truth. Over the last year i have seen her in a decline. Her mental health i think is taking the biggest hit. She is seeing people , hearing voices. Acts completely different. She is to the point now where she cant hide her actions and it is obvious she is messed up. She has stopped taking care of day to day actives. I think she is behind on house payments. She was arrested on thanksgiving for burglary , when i asked her about it she said Bob Marley said she could have the stuff and she wasnt stealing.... This broke my heart to see her in this shape and where she is at in life. I keep trying to get her to go to rehab. She wont. Now she is facing jail time. I dont think she is doing anything about it so im trying to make sure she goes to court when needed and such. I keep telling her she needs to get off the meth. Sometimes she says ok .. sometimes she says she isnt on it. She is really messed up mentally and is a shell of her self. So what can i do? what have you done? what is the progression of this ? is this going to kill her? If she stops will i ever get her back or is damage done ? I am so lost and i dont know what to do. Legally can i do anything? Is there any options for me?",08Dec2020,1

It's like my mind and body are disconnected. Following this I go in from lunch and all my motivation is gone, I start feeling extremely low and useless and I regret everything I just did. This only really happens in social situations, such as hanging about with friends or sometimes family gatherings, and often times when sitting beside friends. During it also I can become extremely talkative and shaky all at the same time, also usually over sharing and sharing secrets that you I'm not ready to share yet, almost like I'm being forced to by some invisible force.

242,"Okay so first off, I'm a 21 f and I know most people think I'm too young to feel this way.

Unfortunately I've been dealing with a lot of health and aging issues lately.

My father had 2 heart attacks this year, my mom had an anemic attack. I've lost my eldest aunt and uncle as well as a few family friends.

This has all caught up to me. Suddenly my little sister and brother (whom I still see as my baby siblings) are going to high school. My one brother finished HS and is moving to the other side of the country for studies and my eldest brother is getting a divorce.

It suddenly caught up to me that I'm already living on my own and doing ""the adult thing"" and I'm even running my own division at work. I don't know where I became an adult as opposed to the kid I feel like I was yesterday.

A few years ago the doctors diagnosed me with endometriosis as well as pre-crevical cancer. I have about three years before my chances of having a kid is basically 0%.

All of this is resulting in my depression acting up again.

How do I deal/cope with the harsh reality of this?

I feel so silly for struggling with this, because I know it's nature and that I am supposed to grow up/old. I just didn't think I would feel as if it's happening so quickly.",08Dec2020,1
243,"Hi all! I apologise that this may be a bit long but please bear with me because I really need advice. I (21F) am the eldest sister of 3 total kids. To kind of explain the situation, my parents have been having a lot of trouble figuring out how to deal with my middle sister (17F) and her lack of willingness to do absolutely anything but sleep and play WOW. (They don't use reddit so I'm looking for tips in their stead).

So currently, my middle sister is in her last year of high school and at the moment she's failing just about every class. She's already been taking extra classes to make up for the classes she failed last year and last semester. She didn't used to be so awful at school, she made As and Bs all throughout elementary and middle school and only in high school have her grades plummeted so far. She attributes a lot of this to some really awful teachers she had that she says ruined learning for her, and the fact that she's quite severely depressed. She was also the kind of kid who was rearing to go to college after graduating but about two years ago decided against it (much to my parent's disappointment). 

She's always been an extremely emotional child, crying at the drop of a hat or the second someone even raised their voice an octave, and she seemed to grow out of it there for a while. But recently she's kind of gone in the opposite direction where she's extremely apathetic about pretty much everything. I know she loves our family and our dogs but she doesn't really have anything she enjoys besides sleeping and playing World of Warcraft. They are legitimately her only hobbies, but I'll talk more on this later.

So she was kind of tough to deal with before quarantine, but being stuck at home without being able to see friends has been extra hard on her and has kind of exaggerated all of her pre-existing issues. 

So, most of the issues with her revolve around school. She just doesn't care whatsoever about turning work in on time (or at all). She cheats on everything, doesn't listen to her teachers when they're teaching over zoom, she's on her phone constantly during classes. She tells our parents that she's working when really she's just playing video games, she lies and says she emailed her teachers when my parents asked her to, but then if anyone checks her sent folder there is nothing there. She just puts in 0% effort. And I know that effort is an incredibly hard thing to find the motivation for when you're depressed but my parents have tried so hard to be accommodating and understanding about her situation but I feel stressed and angry for them every time I see them interact because my sister is so frustrating to deal with.

A typical days starts off with my mom having to wake her up AT LEAST 5 different times. And then my mom recently made a rule where she can't go back to her room in between classes because then she'll just go to sleep and my mom will have to wake her up at least 5 more times, but she does it anyway. She'll say she's going to the bathroom or something and then her class will start and my mom will find her sleeping again. This happens every damn day and at this point she's pretty much 10-30 minutes late to every single one of her classes. And then when she's ""in class"" she's instead either sleeping some more or playing on her phone.

As the oldest child I kinda feel bad that I set the precedent of their kids to be hardworking and motivated. I always got straight As, had a 4.0 GPA, they never had to get on me about my work and I think after dealing with my sister for so long that they've realised that not all children are the same (obviously, but they thought since we were raised together and had very supportive upbringings that we'd at least all get through school fine). 

My parents acknowledge that they weren't the best at figuring out how to motivate my sister because they simply didn't understand why she was doing so terribly in school. But theyve remedied it as best they could and try to help her with all her assignments, starting emailing her teachers for her instead sometimes, and they've even taken a few of her tests for her just so she could get a passing grade in the class and graduate on time (something they never ever EVER thought they would willingly do). Recently my mom was writing a 3 page paper for her on ""Lord of the Flies"" and my sister was supposed to be working on other assignments she was behind on simultaneously. Instead, she was playing Among Us on her phone. And this just pissed me off so much. She's behind on her work, my mom is going waaaaay beyond what she should be to help my sister graduate high school and she's just fucking around with games on her phone. IMO it's so selfish.

Now the problem with trying to confront my sister or get onto her about anything is that it's kinda impossible to punish her and make it actually work

1. It's hard to take anything away from her. Again, all she does is sleep and play WOW. And WOW is kind of the only thing in her life that brings her real happiness. Since she can't see her irl friends, she's always doing raids and talking to her online friends. My parents do ban her from WOW on occasion but they try very hard not to because they know for her it's like a lifeline.
2. If you try to get onto her at all, her excuse is that she's simply depressed. And I suffer from depression myself, but I don't use it as a weapon or an excuse to get out of doing the bare minimum. I understand there are different forms of depression and it affects everyone differently (and so do my parents), but my sister says she's depressed and then does nothing to try and help herself with it. My parents have her on medication for her depression and have been trying to encourage her to see a therapist/psychiatrist but she refuses to. She only takes the medication if she's been reminded 5+ times. She doesn't even try to remember to take it herself. 
3. If you try to take her phone away or honestly just punish her in any form she just cries and slams doors and screams that she's depressed and you shouldn't take away the things she cares about but without taking away anything there are literally no repercussions to her actions. Even when my parents do go through with a punishment, they have a big soft spot for my sister and usually get rid of the punishment within a few days (like maybe she won't be allowed on the computer for a week after failing her 10th test in a row, but then 2 days into the punishment they'll give her back those privileges).

My dad doesn't really understand mental illness at all (but he tries to be quiet and be non-judgemental when the topic is brought up). And my mom has dealt with anxiety and depression after losing both her parents, but my sister is constantly yelling at them and saying they don't understand what it's like being depressed without a cause (my mom's was her parents' death, my sister doesn't have reasons for her depression she just is. Which is valid, mind you). 

But my parents are just at a complete loss as to what to do to deal with her. My dad wants to be stricter (queue constant crying and ""i hate yous""), and my mom is just upset all the time and unsure of how to proceed. My mom's been making her nice breakfasts sometimes and trying to wake her up softly in the mornings so that my sister has a good start to her day, but to no avail. My sister refuses to help herself, and if my parents didn't stay on her ass about schoolwork (or practically do all of it for her) she would fail out of high school. My parents really want her to get a diploma because it unlocks a lot of options for her in the future, especially since she's decided not to go college. IMO they're really looking out for her and going above and beyond to make sure she's as set as she can be for life after high school but she just seems to throw it back in their faces. And she never does anything but there are also never repercussions for the way she acts because she's so hard to deal with sometimes.

And I try to give advice and mostly stay of the whole mess but I'm so tired of seeing my parents feel so stressed over my sister. I love my sister but I think she's being incredibly selfish and should at the very least TRY and help out my parents a little. They don't have to help her like they have, especially since it doesn't make her try any harder or do any extra work. She's just instead become a little more complacent. 

TL;DR:

Sister never does any work for school, is always late, on her phone, failing everything. My parents have been going above and beyond to motivate her, and get her to graduate high school on time without failing anything but it's resulted in them doing most of her schoolwork for her and her just being complacent to let them. There are no repercussions for her putting in 0% effort in school and a lot of other things her in life because if they take anything away she complains their worsening her depression and that the things they take are the only things that make her happy.

I'm sorry this is so long but any tips or advice on how to deal with her are GREATLY appreciated. I'm tired of seeing my parents stressed out over her when she does nothing to help herself. She's depressed and unmotivated and I understand that but eventually there comes a times when depression is one of many reasons and is not an excuse for treating family badly and being selfish.

My mental health has never been amazing and as a guy, mental health issues are something that I've never talked openly about to anyone. I always have the mindset that I can beat it on my own. That my problems aren't bad enough to ask for help. That my problems aren't real, it's all just a mindset.

I always used to think I was of above average intelligence because I always had an easier time learning things than my peers, but over the past few years I've started to notice that I've become much slower and now actually perform worse than my peers.

259,"At the end of September, my ex from 15 years ago, whom I have a very rocky past with (abortion and miscarriage), reached out to me to make an amends. 

Initially I was moved but that quickly turned to anger and suspicion on my end and I responded telling him thank you- but I thought the best use of his time and energy would be to focus on his family (He is married now and has 4 kids). 

I had a couple conversations with friends and my sponsor (I have been sober for a while now) and decided I was a bit harsh and shouldn’t have turned my back on someone seeking peace. I decided to soften my heart and open up to the idea of a conversation and forgiveness toward him. 

Some time passed and life got busy- this past week we were attempting to set up a time for a 30min- hour phone call- when I received a message back this time from his wife. 

It said- “hey Katherine, this is Chris’s wife Emily. Stop contacting my husband. It is very inappropriate and hurtful. Thank you” 

I was shocked as I felt the email was very insinuating and accusatory, when I had done nothing wrong on my end and was only trying to do the right thing. I wasn’t aware he was contacting me behind his wife’s back and would have never been in communication with him if I was aware of that. 

I attempted to contact her and Chris directly on Instagram where you can see if a person has read your message. I wanted all the information clear and out in the open in case he was going to attempt to throw me under the bus (which he has in the past) or delete emails. My messages were read- then I was blocked. 

That is when I became furious. 

Out of desperation to be heard and absolved of this once and for all, I contacted his father whom is a senior pastor at a church. Hoping if anyone could mediate and help resolve the matte (and atleast clear my name from the situation) it would be him. 

His dad- read the email, and wrote back “Thanks Kat! Have a wonderful Christmas” 

I am in utter shock. I feel totally unheard and am so disappointed that two people whom claim to be “men of God” could behave like this. 

What the hell do I do now? Every one is telling me to leave it alone but I feel like no one is being held accountable. I’m disappointed a pastor could look at a situation where someone is in obvious pain and suffering and not even acknowledge it. HELP",08Dec2020,1
260,"Throwaway account because I don't want this traced back to me.

I've been and felt this way for as long as I can remember. I don't talk to people about it, because everybody significant enough in my life for me to talk to about this cut me off the second I brought this up. I'll try to concisely explain everything that's going on:

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to call them hallucinations, but I'm frequently encountering things that just don't make sense. They only ever last for a split second, but they're enough to make me question whether any of this is actually real. Sometimes it'll be creatures hiding in the shadows, other times I see these black curling tendrils that seem to just be spilling from universe, edging towards me for a fleeting second.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also burdened by incredibly invasive thoughts. These can be anything from brief homicidal fantasies, such as picking up a kettle or mug and swinging them into the head of the person beside me, to standing perfectly still in front when I catch myself in the mirror worrying about The King\*. Whenever these involuntary thoughts are occuring, I often find that I just detach from the world around me and become lost in these daydreams for however long they occur.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I find that I've developed these rituals which comfort me, but if they're interrupted I become incredibly hostile. For example, when washing my hands I like to keep them under hot water until the skin reddens. At night, I like to perfectly align the bed sheets so that they're evenly distributed, and I'll wake up periodically to redo these.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried speaking to a therapist about this, but due to the ritualistic side of things, they tried to pin me down with Autism or OCD without considering everything else I've mentioned (though I've not discussed the unwanted homicidal thoughts - I don't want to be sectioned lol). This resulted in me freaking out and missing appointments last-minute, and as I'm in the UK, this has rendered me unable to return to the mental health practice. I'm not sure what to do at this point, but I just feel like I'm breaking.

261,"I’m not sure what to call it but I just feel the need for some kind of excitement or novelty everyday otherwise I feel like I’m wasting my life. 

The best way I can describe it is I have this unrealistic need for my life to be like an adventure. Like the way a group of friends in some TV programme go on adventures and see new places and meet new people.

A travelling lifestyle would suit me to a T but I have obstacles in the way of that........mostly my anxiety, I just recently learned to be comfortable with taking the train on my own locally, I could never imagine myself in a million years travelling on my own abroad...and I’m socially anxious too, so I don’t really have friends to do it with either. 

But more of a reason than that is I can’t imagine how I would get a job or enough money to sustain that way of living. It’s easy to just say ‘get a job that allows you to travel’ or something but it really isn’t that easy...I can’t find anything that’s realistic or would suit my skills...

I guess I’m too terrified and too socially anxious to get the excitement and adventure I’m CRAVING for. I’m too downbeat and anxious to see how I could do it as well. I don’t even have a job at the moment thanks to the pandemic and obviously the lockdown has made getting out and going to events impossible too. 

I honestly don’t think travelling is the only way for me to get the excitement and novelty I desire. Really all I want is for each day of my life to feel different and stimulating. I can’t begin to tell you how much I miss my life at university, I had so many friends and people I knew, lots of new events and parties, and getting to paint/draw and focus on my passions thanks to the subject I studied. I guess it met all needs, but now that time is over all those friends and acquaintances aren’t in one place and have moved back home. 

I just don’t know what I need to do to feel satisfied with my life. And any sort of socialising and getting out to events is put on hold cause of Covid, so I’m feeling very restless and frustrated...

Can anyone else relate? Or any advice...",08Dec2020,1
262,"lHello. I am a psychiatric outpatient and have been for about 10 months. I am 24M, and my current psychiatric medications are Duloxetine (Cymbalta) 60mg 2x/day.   My diagnoses by the psychiatrist are:

1. MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER, RECURRENT EPISODE, MILD W/ PSYCHOTIC FEATURES
2. PERSONALITY DISORDER, OTHER SPECIFIED

And I also have been given this diagnosis by a therapist I saw for about 5-6 months and we mutually agreed to end 2 months ago that therapy was completed (not quit!):

1. Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Yesterday I had the third (and last - my doctor is leaving the network and I will be assigned a new doctor) phone appointment with my 2nd psychiatrist.

Online I can see my after-visit summary but also some notes. I have never been able to see psychiatry notes before (for every other department, yes, but not psychiatry for obvious reasons) but I guess my doctor forgot to hide them this time.

Can someone explain to me what these notes mean?

1. First, he says I have ""limited"" 	for both INSIGHT and JUDGEMENT assessment.
2. ""Patient noted severe learned 	helplessness and continued insistent concern about medications and diagnoses as issues with his limitations with any psychosocial and 	physical improvements. Patient continues to have limited insight about improvement.""
3. ""Session focused on character 	pathology and management of patient ADLs and progression in his 	life.""
4. ""Psychiatry does not recommend additional psychotropics given patient's fixation on illness and disability.""

I have a few comments about these too:

1. I specifically said I do have Suicidal Ideation - and he knows I have for the past several years - 	but he wrote that I denied it. I specifically said it has gotten worse since our last phone call, too.
2. I am physically disabled and am on SSI since March 2020 (retroactively October 2018 when I first 	applied - fought for 18 months through rejections and appeals and seeing a judge in court). I have diagnoses spinal stenosis and degenerative disc disease with chronic pain.
3. Because of my physical disability, I am unable to drive and therefore do things independently. I don't believe my doctor truly understands how my pain and disability are truly physically limiting...

During the phone call, he mentioned NONE of the stuff he wrote in the notes. All he told me was:

1. “Something has to radically change about \[my\] life.” - an EXACT quote he said about my life.
2. “Set tangible goals – what are the goals for \[MY NAME\] in 2021?”
3. He also said - “what do you think you need to do to get to the life a 24 year old man should be 	living?” - I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S MY PROBLEM. Also, what “should” someone be doing?

I do have a phone appointment next week with my new (and third) psychiatrist and I don't even know what to do. The mental healthcare system seems to be futile in helping.

He keeps saying “you're 24, dude” and it's making me feel like I'm wasting my life and that feeling makes me want to die even more. I haven't been passionate about anything for over 10 years (not joking – been depressed since high school 1st/2nd year)

He says I have so much life to live and things to see and experience...but like what? And if I can't drive or work because of my disability and I only get some money per month from the government to survive on...

And even if I get a job, I NEED the SSI for the healthcare coverage. I would always give up my money if it meant my full healthcare coverage was kept.

I have to see neurologists, physical therapists, orthopedics, physical medicine doctors for my spinal issue alone. Then there's the medications I take for the pain and for HIV prevention – those are expensive otherwise. Then there's the psychiatry and therapy appointments that would be expensive. And I went to the ER 2 weeks ago for chest pains – that would have been expensive.

My psychiatrist believes I might be able to do some kind of work/job – and maybe that is true. HOWEVER, if I do that I would lose my health coverage. I need my health coverage because of all my issues.

Is this a fixation? Or is this just me trying to make sure I am secure and stable so if something goes wrong I won't be totally out of luck.

I really need the opinion of some psychiatrists here. What should I do on my phone appointment next week? What should I say? Am I just hopeless?",08Dec2020,1

I don't know if this is just one of those random weird thoughts everyone has at some point, or if it's actually a thing.

268,"Toxic manipulative parent and the other enables or is oblivious to the years of abuse and encourages/guilts you into contacting the abusive parent consistently. 

Parents are divorcing. 

Dad is pretty solid. Maybe a bit controlling and even arrogant, but a good dad. 

Mom is an addict, but even sober has been emotionally and psychologically abuse since I was adopted into the family.  

Now they are divorcing a bad I happened to love back into the he same town. So mom fell off the wagon, and has been lashing out in every way possible. Creating circumstances to try and get others to rally around her, but no one is rallying bc she's pushed everyone away. 

Dad feels guilty for instigating the episodes from the divorce, and still cares for her well being. Even if the divorce is still going forward. 

He's been leaning on me as the only family left in town. But doesn't realize how big of an ask it is to care for my abuser. Not just in times past, but new abuse occurs at every meeting or phone call. (Nearly every one...of course there's a one of short convo, but honestly even those are just sessions to garner trust.)

She's very manipulative. Creates chaos, division, makes herself the go to when possible and when not at the very least poisons people against each other or even themselves. 

I don't know how to properly explain to my dad that I can't be the new him. And that he's asking an abused person to go be abused more.  If I did try to explain this he will make me feel dumb or guilty. As if I'm ""overreacting"" like us women folk do you know... 

Anytime I've done well in my life it's when I've had a lot of distance and sort of shut her out. 

I feel terrible about it, but what do you do when there is no reasoning with the crazy. You can't fix the abuser, you can't fix an addict by being sympathetic. These things are their responsibility. I think they can change, but only when they truly want to and find a reason to do so for real. 

In the mean time, what do I do? Do I let them both guilt me into just doing what they want and let it basically kill me inside...but u know be a ""good daughter""? 

Or do I have a right to set boundaries and make a life for myself and try to get past the abuse?",08Dec2020,1

Todays argument was how I leave the table covered in stuff so nobody can eat there (Nobody eats there when it's empty, they all use trays in front of the TV) and Yesterday he started by saying how my art work isn't ""Real Art"".

They threaten me with the police and sometimes have me arrested, I called the police on them once for stealing and opening my letters and my mum and dad talked the way out of it and the police believed them.

I'm suicidal because of them and they.

I have attempted suicide a few different times and different ways and every time I call the police and helplines, they never believe me and hang up on me (once the police sent my mum instead and didn't come their self), nobody takes me seriously.

I want to disown my parents but can't because I live with them. It feels like I'm trapped with them and can't ever leave.

The only other person I’ve spoken about this to is my girlfriend who was diagnosed with anxiety a couple years ago and I found that a lot easier.

Over the course of this year I’ve slowly realized that I have an idealistic vision of what I think relationships should be like, because I grew up in an unhealthy environment. It makes most of my interactions with people pretty shallow (though polite), as a way to escape emotional vulnerability so there’s less chance of being on anyone’s bad side and being hurt/abandoned . I spend all of this time trying to keep up with this false ego that it carries over to the relationships with people who ARE close with me which just makes it obvious how socially broken I actually am. From time to time I find it incredibly hard to think of what to say to say around people which I feel makes social situations super awkward and causes me to self isolate.

""Just a bad day,"" I thought the first time. I hadn't really noticed it till the evening, must've been a stressful day.

""Just one of those weekends,"" I didn't get much done so I was probably feeling down about that.

""Just a bad week..."" and I noticed that it wasn't. It was a productive and otherwise enjoyable week.

Now Im sat here wondering why the last few weeks have been the same. I've had moments before, I suppose we all get something from time to time, I tried what usually works. Songs, movies, art, sleep, if anything it's made it worse. Sleep is becoming more difficult to keep regular and 8+ hours.

Today has been the worst. I woke up feeling refreshed and left my bedroom wishing for the day to just end. By the time I left the house I'd flipped twice more.

I have always been a very functional person and it just hasnt interrupted my life in such a way that I thought talking to someone was necessary. It sounds bad but it was always ""I'm managing fine so I dont want to make a fuss"".

I had this feeling of embarrassment too, of course, because it can be hard to explain OCD to someone who doesnt have or understand it right? I have tried to tell people from long ago in my past who will interrupt me with their own conclusions, or just openly tell me I'm strange. I know a professional wouldnt react like this but those experiences just made me feel really embarrassed.

It's all based around unwavering anxiety for me, and the worse it is, the longer I'll take to leave the house, or get to bed, or leave my car.

Sometimes I worry about big, horrible things that are unlikely to ever happen, from abandonment, being completely alone, worrying that I'm disliked generally, to non-existent health worries that make me feel like I need to wash.

What would be the positives for getting an official diagnosis? Are there any negatives? What actual help could I get?

Its a blurry picture of a dark sphere-like shape that gets bigger with each depressing or traumaric thing that has happened to you, with a more bright part in the middle for the happy memories. The outer sphere always feels like its oppressing the happy memories inside. 
Now to the part of me I cant really put my finger on. 
I'm not a huge fan of drinking. I like the ideo of being sober and have a clear mind, but this time I've been to a party of a friend. I drank a bit too much and shared parts of me I never showed ANYONE besides myself (there were only trustworthy people I dont mind them knowing). This night is the most memorable and happy memory I have. After the party, the next day was by far the closest day to me comitting suicide. It was horrible. Even weeks after there always was this feeling that the lock just opened for a bit too long and everything I bottled up my whole life just swapped over and almost drowned me in it. There weren't even any particular thoughts that haunted me. It was just pure hatred on myself and everything I had done on this evening. 
About 2 months I decided to make a really big change for me, which was a kind-of different hairstyle. Well no, not different, just being confident with what I was so insecure for so long. This was after girl I met after a long lost friendship when she suggested it me and gave me compliments about it. I had a HUGE moral boost and thought to myself that I'd rather kill myself with too much positivity than negativity. And im still not out of it. But Im already have the feeling that the big sad is going to come harder than it was before. Theres just this feeling of something lost inside me and a whole lot of emptyness creeping up on me in a close future. 
Thanks for reading, just wanted to get it out of my head and maybe some opinions on it. Maybe similar experiences.",08Dec2020,1

Last year on the 5th of december, I tried to commit suicide and since then I was put on anti depressants. Since I overdosed, I (and my friends) didn't trust me with the pills laying around in the house, so I decided to give them to my friend and every week I stopped by to collect my weekly supply of serotonine. 
Then 2020 came around and the lockdown was exactly what I needed at that point. Every pressure to succeed in this rat race society disappeared and I could just live my life at a slow pace. Nobody was expecting anything from me, or like anybody in society. Things got better so after my last subscription I just kept the pills and it went fairly well.

But this semester -I'm a uni student- shit just got 10 times worse than before my suicide attempt. There is an awful amount of pressure to keep up with the classes, I can't see most of my friends, I haven't seen my family in about a year, nobody can give me a hug and tell me everything is going to be alright. In my student dorm we have frequent problems with a false fire alarm going off, and that results in me getting a panic attack because what if it's real this time and I can't take my stuffed animals with me and the get burnt in the fire? Because those stuffed animals are now my safe haven. They are always there for me, I can hug them when I need them, and I can't get that taken away from me. Every sound that sounds like the start of the fire alarm, like someone squeaking with his shoes over the floor in the hallway makes me get such an adrenaline rush etc. 
I have to celebrate christmas on my own because of federal measures (belgium) and there's a lot more stuff going on right now but everything combined makes me lowkey suicidal. It's not that I want to die, I just don't want to live anymore. But admitting that to anyone is a big step for me, and so is giving my pills to that friend again. So I only want to do it if it is really necessary. Does this look like it is necessary? 

And if so, how should I do this? Should I text her in advance and ask if it is okay or is it acceptable to just show up at her door and give her the pills?

I can't even think for myself amymore. I need someone to take me by my hand and guide me through life. I need advice for everything, that's why I'm asking this kinda stupid question to you guys.",08Dec2020,1
304,"Whenever I see a post on Facebook sparking a 'debate' (where nothing constructive is actually being said), or a thread on Twitter where people are *furious* about something someone said or did, I just look at them and feel this sense of bewilderment. Not because I don't understand the points being raised, but what I can't understand is why anyone would dedicate so much time to trying to convince a stranger on the Internet that they are wrong. Reading the comments below news articles, I find myself feeling more and more like an outcast in society, because people are just heckling each other like animals in a cage, and there rarely seems to be much intelligence behind the words. 

I feel like the world has gone mad. I don't see intelligent life anywhere; the few who dare speak a different opinion or stray from the crowd are judged and hushed into a corner, whilst the ones who stick to the mainstream rhetoric are praised for being 'unique' and 'outspoken'. 

Overtime, I think this realisation has kind of turned into a toxic personality trait of mine where I think everyone is stupid, and I feel superior because of it - though in reality, I know this is not the case.

I feel bad for feeling this way. I know a lot of these thoughts probably stem from being isolated for way too long. I have severe depressive periods on a regular basis, and lately I've been finding it harder to connect with reality. Everything feels so mundane. Sometimes I wish I cared about the things everyone else seems to, just so I could feel like I fit into this world. 

Does anyone else feel even remotely similar? Or am I just well and truly mad?",08Dec2020,1
305,"I have all these problems, insecurities and I have no one to help me, no one to talk to. I have a nice family, friends but I don’t feel comfortable talking to anyone. I just can’t do it. As the title says I cry my self to sleep each night I haven’t felt joy in god knows how long. And no one close to me knows this. I’m left to fight my demons by myself and I can’t do it much longer. I have generally nothing to live for I haven’t done it because I don’t want to hurt the people I love but that reason not to do it is feeling less and less valid each day.",08Dec2020,1
306,"I turned 31 a month ago (male). Two years ago I escaped a very dark 2-3 year episode of my life, never went back to it, the pills that I was taking for a couple months were cut (as per the plan of the doctor who prescribed them of course) and they did help me out without staying forever.  


Now, two years, later it has been been a few days since those old deamons, depression and anxiety due to the very same themes have somewhat returned - I can't think straight, very axnious, don't eat up until late evening as I am too anxious to feel hungry. Tomorrow I am scheduling an appointment with my doctor asap. I am planning a career change and can't afford to fail due to my mental health.  


My 20s weren't all that bad and dark. But I have had some issues that seems to have never dissappeared. Maybe in my 30s I should finally find a good therapist? (Those I had tried sucked big time.) I hope I will get my shite together, the thought I will forever be a Peter Pan not fully grown man frightens me.",08Dec2020,1

308,"I can't cry.

If I get upset, I automatically turn off my emotions, and shut it down, all the thoughts causing me to feel bad. 

But underneath I still feel shit.

I'm worried my fear of being vunerable is the key of my anxiety, all the mistakes i've made in life, the reason why I'm like this, why I can't make close friends, why I withdraw from people if I feel the slightest insecurity. 

So how do I let myself be vunerable, how do I cry in my room with flatmates in the house?

How do I do all this in a healthy way?

How do I stop shutting down all my emotions?

Honestly this inability makes me feel faulty, and get thoughts about ending it. It would be so much easier. 

I know it's not the answer but the fantasy is tantalisng. 

How do I fix myself? Does anyone else suffer from this??",08Dec2020,1
