2,"Ever wondered what Lucifer feels like? Of course not. You think hes the worst thing to ever exist. There is something far worse though, the masses who'd ignorantly condemn one with only hearing a biased story from one source. 

Ever consider Atlus' plight? To carry the weight of earth upon his back? Of course not. The story tells you he was a fool but does not point out his willingness to help another.

Ever consider what the earth feels like? No. You tread upon it, spit on it, dump your garbage on it. Cutting off its limbs and scorching its face for profit. You do not consider the earth sustains your very existence.

There is an opposite to all things but you dont care. 

Ever considered the plight of the next man? No. You care only for self and what can be done for you. You scoff at any you think is less financially stable than you, anyone you think is of lesser intelligence you deem worthless,  but you never look in the mirror.

A dandelion is called a weed yet a rose is called beauty.  Your populace you call civilization yet uncivilized as a whole you live in a torrent of chaotic deeds. 

You live your whole life in pursuit of pieces of paper with dead mens faces printed on it while I live my life in pursuit of a place away from you. 

Depression is real and far reaching. Your world, your civilization, your ideation of life kills me slowly. When I lash out you call me crazy but anyone comfortable in today's world cannot be called sane.

Earth is a cage. I am not trapped here with you. I allow you to remain. The only thing stopping me from removing you is a yes or no decision that I make each time i draw a breath because I've never wished to treat others as they treat me. If i do you'll just call me a monster,  as i call you all monsters now.

For me isolation is comforting, solitude is solace. It's just better that way.",19Jan2020,1

4,"What I mean is do I have to be depressed and sad in that moment? I have suffered major depressive episodes on and off since high school. The longest, continuous one was from September to October of last year. A constant two months of a horrible depressive slump. I binged food, I couldn't shower or do any chores, I fell behind in school work, I isolated myself, I considered stepping out in front of a car multiple times, it was just awful. But now that slump is over and I'm feeling relatively normal again. I have my first ever meeting with a psychiatrist this upcoming Tuesday and hope to finally be officially diagnosed. But I am terrified that I will walk in there appearing to be fine and that he'll dismiss me just like every other counselor or doctor I've talked to has just because I seem fine in the moment and ""manage"" well enough.

Can I trust that he'll actually talk to me and ask about times other than the present? Because the past few years have been hell and I don't want to walk in there seeming to be fine when I know that I'm not.",19Jan2020,1
5,"Hey, I thought i might find some people here who have the same problem as me. I suffer from Anxiety since about summer 2018. Sometimes for some days or even shorter a specific problem came up. I couldn't swallow, no pain or anything just no swallowing, like an invisible wall. Sometimes just food and liquid and when it was bad not even my saliva, so I had to spit it out every 3 min. This problem subsided every time after some hours/days. But now I have it already for about 6 months and it doesn't seem to go away. At the end of the year it was almost gone but now with the start of university and exam season, it came back. It's worse in the evening. I struggle to swallow liquids the most. I'm sick of this problem. Has someone maybe had similar experiences or could give me some tips. (I'm seeing a therapist btw). Thanks You!",19Jan2020,1
6,"I have talked to social workers in the past and have sought non medication help for what I felt was depression. I don't believe I ever received an official diagnosis, but I believe it was or would be something related to social anxiety and some form of depression. I had a good run for a few months where I did not feel negative or really have any bad or unusually bad thoughts or feelings. However, it seems to have come back with more and more dark thoughts getting back into my head. I don't know what this means. I don't know if I should start to see someone again, if I should try to seek medical help for my issues, or if I should seek some sort of more serious psychiatric care? i don't know if this is the right place to post this, but I am afraid to reach out to other resources like the crisis life lines online or by phone. any advice or help would be appreciated. i know there's not a lot of info provided but I didn't want to go too deep into personal feelings or say something off limits.",19Jan2020,1
7,"I'm from England and I have suffered through some experiences along with some mental health difficulties. about a year and a half ago I was discharged from a psychiatric hospital into a supported living flat in the community. Trouble was - my next door neighbour was very abusive. She kept this up for a long time; calling me and anpther service user 'retards'. She assaulted the other guy and she threatened to bring her three brothers into my house. She would wake me up in the middle of the night by throwing things at my window (I lived on the ground floor). I.E A football etc etc. I rang the police instead of taking it out on her as I had just had a situation with safeguarding with my mother (nothing horrible but I didn't want to complicate anything in anyway - understandably). The police were very poor at their job each time just telling me to ignore her insults and threats. At some point they did decide to try charge her with 'a public order offence with hateful intent' but the police rang me about 6 months later and told me they had left it too long so they couldn't do anything. I hate to say it but I often fantasise about dishing out some revenge. I don't want to go into it so much as it's unnecessarily inappropriate but I fantasise often about breaking into her house; beating up her boyfriend and her and torturing them both. I come up with meticulously detailed plans involving ways to hurt them both. I don't want to kill them but I'm so angry I want to do something. My nurse thinks I could have PTSD and this ordeal definetly wouldn't have helped with that. Not just the woman but I have much less of a respect for the police now. It affects much more than just how I feel but also how I think. I have a completely different perception of crime now in ways I can't explain. But I'm not too confident that it's for the better.

I think of ending my life but recently I've been more swayed by anger - leading me to prefer the option of ruining theirs more than mine.

Positive note: I'm not going to do this. I'm a good person but I feel very hurt. I want to work with my nurse and I'm on a waiting list for CBT. I'm also a big fan of the bible. I'm not very religious but I believe it holds much wisdom and I can learn from it. I do think that if there is a god. I can have the worst life imaginable - one that could possibly mirror hell itself. But I know that if I do the right thing and stay true to what is good and holy then it won't matter in the slightest for I will join Jesus Christ in heaven come judgement day.

I guess all I want right now is a little sympathy. I will be honest and hold my hands high if that sounds like attention-seeking behaviour. But in my defence I in fact crave that relativity to my peers; I want to know I'm not alone.

Final point: It saddens me to see bad things happen in this world. So can I please ask a favoir from my fellow redditors?:
I believe that seeing sin and failing to act is in turn just as sinful. So please; I'd like to ask that if anyone sees something wrong. Don't stand idle. Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) fans will know what I mean.",19Jan2020,1

9,"Is it normal to feel down/kinda sad for no clear reason whatsoever. This has happened to me throughout my whole life. When I was younger Mum used to ask me what was wrong and why I was crying and I would just say that I didn't know. Because I genuinely did not know why I was feeling down. I still get this sometimes. Like these last couple of days. There is plenty to be happy about but it's like my brain is keeping secrets from me or something about why I'm feeling what. 


Anyone else experienced this?",19Jan2020,1
10,"My parents relationship haven’t been the best, even when I was little. I think there was a time where they were on good terms, but because my sister often leaves her diabetes to my parents, and she has decided to drop out of high school, they’ve gone back to constantly fighting over what to do with her.
It’s only now because my brother is in college and my sister is a senior in high school, it leaves me being the youngest as a sophomore. When they start fighting I can’t help but cry in my room as my mom come in and asks me if she leaves, would I go with her. 
I feel so many emotions in my head, but I don’t know how I can express it. I’ve only found it in music, But only now I don’t feel the same kind of release when I play, becoming unmotivated and more of homework to me. The only way I can find some release is by crying, becoming more controlling, or throwing things away in my room. Which all of them have been losing the effect they’ve used to have.",19Jan2020,1
11,"I'm 23 years old, and I genuinely think it's impossible to help myself. Anytime something makes me really really upset, which can be even the littlest problems, I get super depressed and am basically crippled in my bed. Then I spend hours venting to people all over the internet, or people I know in real life about my issues. 

Only other people can help me. The only reason I haven't comitted suicide years ago is because of other people. But if it were all up to me and there was no one around for me to cry to, I would have swallowed a bunch of sleeping pills and sleep forever. I hate my life, I hate that I was born, I hate the 10 therapists that couldn't help me, i hate the group therapy programs I've been in, I hate the institution I've been sent too, and I hate that I can't do anything right in life... I even hate the people I talk to because they can't always help me. I hate myself, and I hate my life.

14,"My 38 year old sibling was diagnosed with LD, ADD, speech problems and allergies as a kid. My parents didn't like what Ritalin did to him, so they stopped giving it to him after 1 week. So growing up he did not take any medication. He has struggled in school, at home and work and with his weight. I believe he has an undiagnosed condition, but I don't know what type of doctor to go to for a diagnosis. 
He is morbidly obese.  He is under 5’8” and well over 320 pounds.  He is a compulsive eater, and will eat combinations of food other people simply wouldn’t think of, such as spaghetti with mayonnaise (an entire large jar of mayonnaise at that) or just plain hot dog buns.  All of this has led to a number of serious health problems, including sudden onset diabetes, which he was diagnosed with in December 2018, and severe sleep apnea.  These very serious health issues, which are dangerous and scary by themselves, are made much worse by his behavioral issues.  In fact, his diabetes diagnosis was only arrived at because there was a perfect storm of his poor health and behavioral problems.
He refuses to wear pants and prefers the cold, so during the winter he will go and sit on the porch in shorts and a tee shirt and watch videos on his phone regardless of the temperature.  He simply does not seem to feel the cold, and if he does he simply does not care.  This leads to dry skin (in addition to a chronic cough). When he gets dry skin, he picks at it compulsively which means his legs are always scabbed or bruised.  It seems like he can't tell when he has pain.  Last December, he picked at his leg and ultimately wound up with an infection.  He didn’t tell anyone about the infection until the skin was literally bubbling and oozing.  By the time he brought it to my attention (he hid it from our mom) he had a bubble the size of a golf ball by his ankle and was oozing puss to the point where there was a trail where he walked.  My sister and I insisted he go to the hospital, and when we got there he was immediately admitted (he stayed in a hospital bed for 10 days). 
While at the hospital they asked him his pain level on a scale of 1-10.  He calmly said it was a 2.  The Doctors did not believe that (so much so that they gave him Fentanyl).  After they administered the antibiotics via IV they ran blood work and diagnosed him with diabetes and informed him he was lucky to have his leg. 
Shortly after getting out of the hospital, he got an infection in his eye (cellulitis) and, after seeing an opthamologist  we were told to go straight to the ER.  He was then transferred to two different hospitals (via ambulance) because each hospital was so worried there would need to be an emergency surgery that could perhaps involve removing his eye. Once again when he was asked about his pain level he said it was a 2, and once again the doctor said he should've been in a lot more pain and administered Fetanyl. Ultimately he recovered, though the extent of the damage to his eye is still unknown.
Both times he told people that his leg or eye had looked the way it did for only a couple of days, which was impossible. His leg had been untreated for a month before anyone in the family was aware of it and rushed him to the hospital and his eye had been untreated for a week before we noticed it and rushed him to the hospital. After both of the incidents we decided to start going to his doctor appointments with him. At his appointments he said he was fine, nothing bothered him and answered questions with one word answers (the same way he responds to us). 
His health problems continue, and we once again had to take him to the hospital because of an open wound on his leg (roughly one year after he was first rushed to the ER with bubbling/oozing wounds).  They are simply made worse by his attitude/behavioral issues.  He lies to doctors, his family, and himself about his health. He is very stubborn and will do things out of spite. You can show him proof that he is wrong and he will simply deny it without offering any counterpoint. He will be sick and refuse to go to the doctor; if you ask him to do a chore he will leave and come back late at night so he doesn't have to do it; if you give him a date by which he needs to have a chore completed he will wait until an 11 PM of that date to start doing it (if he even does it all). If you talk to him about something he doesn't like (chores, doctors, weight, health, his eating, etc.) he will just ignore you and doesn't respond to you. When he is not working (he works as a cashier and is on his feet most of the day - despite doctor's orders that he limit the time spent on his feet until he loses weight) he just sits and watches tv (which, admittedly, he has done his whole life).
He also struggles socially.  While he is a very sweet and generous person he has struggled to find his place, and simply retreats into himself.  He goes to the movies by himself a few days a week. At any given time he has seen almost every movie in the theater (some of them twice). He has never had a girlfriend and has never had many friends. 
Additionally, he has “quirks” that may be indicative of something more serious. He has motor and vocal tics - blinks his eyes multiple times, twitches/shakes his head/neck, jerks his mouth/lips, and makes a spitting/hissing noise with his tongue against his teeth.  In addition to his compulsive eating, he seems to have other compulsions such as picking his skin until he bleeds, washing his hands with scalding hot water, checking and rechecking things (like closing doors), touching things.  If his clothes are in the dryer and you move them, he will wash them again. He also hoards and keeps things that most people would get rid of immediately.  He doesn't clean his room or car and refuses to allow anyone to. 
He also falls asleep when he is driving (he has been in many car accidents because of this). When he is not driving, he falls asleep every car ride within minutes. When he was left in charge of taking care of my parents cars that are in the garage, he would have to start them every few days so that the battery wouldn't die. He would start the cars in the closed garage and leave them running for a couple of hours nearly killing himself and me. When he was told he could not do that he got upset and just ignored me. The next time he did it he cracked the garage door, but did not realize it wasn’t opened above the exhaust pipe, and once again filled the garage and house with exhaust. I told him he could not do that, he had to open the garage fully and/ or take them out of the garage. He still refuses and I have to go out there and open the garage door. He has left the air compressor running all day nearly blowing up the house.  He refuses to help out around the house or follow any of the rules set for him (clean his room/bathroom). 
He has run up $20,000 credit card debt, 95% of it on food. He has no savings or any money. He lives pay-check to pay-check and everything else my mom takes care of. He lives with my mom. I do not believe he will ever be able to live on his own. We have tried antidepressants and nothing changed. Not too long ago I asked him about his future and he said he was going to get married and have kids one day. He is 38 and has never had a girlfriend or done anything that would lead to him one day getting married or having kids.  
Obviously, there are a lot of issues/problems.  I love my brother and want him to live the best life he possibly can, but when I look at everything that is going on and everything that has happened, I know that he will not be able to until he receives the proper care, which begins with a proper diagnosis. He does not think he has a problem, and would be heartbroken if he knew how apparent it is to those around him that he needs help.  Because he is 38 years old I am not able to direct his medical care.  I want to help my brother before it is too late, and know that he needs medical assistance but am unable to direct his medical care.  I am wondering what the proper approach is/where I can go from here.",19Jan2020,1

19,"Hi reddit i am a 21 year old male and over the past 5 Years I have stuggled With life to the point Where i just dont know what to do any more

It all started When i was around 15-16 When i stopped going out and Communicating with my Friends Due to my low confidence, Then as the years progressed it developed into depression and Lonliness

I hardly Have any friends now because they are too busy with thier own lives and ive also never had a Girlfriend So im not Experienced With women Which makes it hard for me To develop a Relationship. Im also an Introvert as well, Would say im shy but i struggle With making connections

Im currently at School Studying Engineering hoping to progress onto uni and Get a Degree in mechanical Engineering But over the past few years i just cant seem to stick at a Job long enough Cause i Either get Bored and leave or i End up getting laid off

Over the past year ive been really Trying to put myself out there and i would Try to start Conversations With random people but i just cant seem to make a Connection with people. I find it pretty hard to communicate with random people

I see Groups of Friends and Couples With each other happy all the time But i just Wish i had what they had. I wish i could feel what it feels like to wanted Or ""Loved""

This really Hurt but the other day i was sitting at a bar on my Own and as i was sitting there this old guy came up to me and starting speaking to me, He then Told me that he was a psychologist For over 20 years and then Told me That I was a ""Ticking Time bomb"" and to get help

I wasnt even Doing anything apart From just Drinking a beer by myself But he then said that he knew by my body language and Communication skills that i was Struggling with life

This ex-psychologist Also Told me that he had a brother once Who Had the same Traits as me and he said that One day his brother ended up unfortiantly taking his own life

Dont get me wrong, This guy (Cant remember his name) was a Good person and so was his wife that he introduced me to But What he said Shook me.

I also Got Bullied When i was in School but it pisses me Off seeing the people Who use to bully me With better lives than myself. 

I was So close to beating the shit out of this guy Who use to bully me in school the other day cause it pissed me off seeing him With a Girlfriend, I felt like he doesnt Deserve a woman or to Experience love

I dont Know, I plan on just working hard in School so that i can hopefully land a High paying Job cause at least money will give me some Power

At least with money i could Buy what i want, It would make me feel a bit more happy and i could also Buy myself Woman if i wanted to so that i dont spend the rest of my life alone

People say money doesnt bring happiness but i know for a fact that my life Would be better with an Extra few Hundred Thousand in the bank

I think having more money would solve Alot of my problems Because i just dont have that much to offer. Well according to IQ tests i did once im classed as ""Intelligant"" (apparently my IQ is Around 137) But  apart From that i dont have much To offer

im not that Funny, I Find it hard To Make connections, I cant Flirt with women, Im Quiet, Im pretty good looking and Tall but im not a model But i just dont think i have much to offer

20,"I have bad anxiety over making decisions that would involve other people. It gets worse when it involves people that I care about and people that I don’t want to lose in my life. I heard, read and know that if people leave you because of something (that isn’t necessarily bad or a deal breaker) then they weren’t  worth keeping in the first place but I still can’t wrap my head around that fact completely. Because if you make a decision, you made it. You chose what to do. You chose when to do it. You chose how to do it. Some factors may have been affected and it wasn’t all you but the thing is you still chose to do it. So if I chose to do something and picked the wrong timing and I lost that person (because they chose to leave me) then it’s my fault. It’s my fault that I couldn’t wait. It’s my fault that I couldn’t be patient enough to wait for the best time because my anxiety told me I needed answers. It makes me puke. It debilitates me. It makes me incapable of doing anything productive for the rest of the day because I’ve decided to either sleep it off or just stare off somewhere and let my anxiety sit on my chest because I’m too afraid it’ll follow me into my dreams and then there’s the possibility that I wouldn’t have control in that dream and I’m forced to have a sort of first hand experience with the consequences of my actions. It’s reached a point where it physically hurts me, and I’m hoping that it’s all just in my head and that it hasn’t really given me a physical sickness. My heart hurts too much to the point that I can’t breathe and I want to scratch it and stab it to make it go away. It makes me feel like I want to die, that I’d rather die because then I wouldn’t have to deal with this.",19Jan2020,1
21," So, I was recently confronted with hard truths. I had a great friend in my life that challenged me more than anyone else in my life to be a better version of myself. They called me out on most occasions for self-pity, self-sabotage, gaslighting, etc. I lost this friend the other day because I hurt them badly due to selfish, fear driven actions to be emotionally real. Most of the time I was completely unaware of what I was doing. I was insecure about believing them. I was insecure about myself and what they actually saw in me and how they felt about me. I had a lot of doubt in them and in myself, which caused much confusion for them. 

I found that I have a fear of success. However, I have this fear I have narcissistic tendencies. Through years of being belittled, isolated, and viewed as awkward by peers, family, and those in authority over me I came to believe the lies others were telling me, I am not good enough. These lies are currently greatly ingrained in my truths to where I miss out and hurt others. So, instead of believing others I gaslit. Instead of believing I am good enough I live in self-pity, shame and doubt. I realized that I cannot go back in time and change the past, but to move forward and find healing for how I have hurt others. Also, to move forward in my own healing. I feel awful about what I’ve done. 

Others thought they were the cause for how I treated them and my actions, but it wasn’t them it was me. I find myself disgusting for my actions. Now I fear this friend will never know the truth that it was me and not them. They’ve asked for space which, at first, I had a hard time respecting because I feared they would never return. So, instead of space I spent time inundating them with my thoughts, which was stupid and disrespectful and shows more sabotaging, selfish behavior. I have more respect for them to do that. I have done many stupid things. Now I have more fear because I am unsure they will ever comeback into my life. I want the best for them and currently that is not me. They were my best friend, the only person in my life, currently, who I believe cares enough to say something. 

I feel lost and depressed. I have really worked on understanding myself, motivations, and intentions over the last few days. I’ve searched for the why and I’ve found some evidence, but awareness is not enough. I need to heal. I am NOT this person I have shown others, I don’t want to be this person. I don’t want to live in fear, fear torments and in my life I have tormented others. I start therapy next week to help me with healing and moving forward. I am hopeful that I will become a better version of myself. I am aware of who I have become and have a strong desire to be emotionally healthy, for myself and others.",19Jan2020,1

24,"
This is really hard for me to write because I don’t know if I’m overreacting. I probably am. I’m sorry.....but here goes.


I’m an 18 year old college student and I had a rough time with my family growing up.  My dad worked and my mom stayed home, meaning my mom was my primary parent I was around. 


I grew up being spanked, and I don’t think that is abusive in and of itself, but I remember her chasing me around the apartment with a ruler/belt because I was afraid. I remember being yelled at a lot when I made mistakes. Not like raising your voice, but her just going completely off on me. I said the phrase “screwed up” and i didn’t realize what it meant and that it was “bad” because I was literally 7 years old, and i got completely chewed out in the car in front of my cousin.


From when I was 12 until now, my relationship with my mom deteriorated. I had anxiety and depression, and she ignored it. Made me feel like a mistake. She would scream at me if I forgot to wash a pan or left cups in my room. She was never patient. If I cried she would tell me that I shouldn’t be crying and that I was overreacting. She would skew the story when telling my dad to get him on my side, and when I cried he would get mad as well.


They eventually let me get medicated for my mental health, but they never tried to help me besides that. Never talked to me about it, and always told me how “hopefully you’ll be off the medication soon because it’s bad for you and it costs money.” Never hoping I was feeling better for myself - always making me feel guilty about my depression and anxiety.


It never really got physical. My mom hit me a few times in the car when she got angry, which scared the heck out of me. She always threatened “the belt”, but because after 13 I was old enough to resist “the belt” she never actually went through with it. The last time I was spanked, I was 13.


If I cried too loud, she would tell the that the neighbors would call the cops and take me away. It used to get me to stop crying, but when I was 17 I told her to “let them” because I hated living with them so much. 


Senior year of high school my mom and I fought every day, and i can honestly say that she started most fights. I was extremely suicidal, and I thought about taking my life every single day for months (from about January of 2019 to present, so basically a full year).

I keep switching between watching videos (several different ones), checking posts here, and playing Candy Crush on another tab, but I only can concentrate on any of these things for a few minutes before I have to do something else. I have to also mention that my impulses are off the charts bad. I just burned toilet paper in the bathroom (over the toilet of course) and the relief/release/pleasure I got from that was holy SHIT tremendous. I wonder if one has anything to do with the other...

27,"My whole life I've tried to avoid having to take pharmaceuticals for my mental illness.  I've just been smoking weed everyday since high school, it's gotten to the point where it's like a part of my check list and that's it.  It isn't helping as much anymore.

I've never felt as terrible as I do today and these past few, I think I have a serious issue.  Going to see a therapist as soon as I get back to my home state.  I think it could be a lot of things, MPD, OCD, OCPD, PTSD, obviously unmanageable anxiety.  A combination of multiple things likely.  It's crazy how our trauma affects us, huh?

If it weren't for the pain I'd leave behind I'd 100% shoot my brains out.  But my mom loves me a lot for whatever reason.  I give up, I'll take whatever pharmaceuticals they'll give me.  This isn't how life's supposed to be.

28,"Not sure if this is the right sub to ask this, but why do I have trouble getting to the point?

When answering or asking a question, explaining something, or talking about my day I have a tendency to ""tell a story"" (i.e., give too much background information, elaborate too much, provide unnecessary details, etc.). 

This happens on reddit and other forums, and in everyday life. My wife is often annoyed by this, I'm annoyed by this, and I'm sure many other people are too (on and offline).

I can't help it, it just happens all the time and I'm sick of it. I do have depression and anxiety issues so maybe that is part of it(?) Can anyone help or give insight, or offer advice, or anything for that matter?",19Jan2020,1

30,"Once every two or three months I suffer from experiences in which someone says or does something and suddenly my perception of the world (including myself) changes completely. For some seconds i feel like I wake up from a dream-like state of mind and suddenly i can see reality as it actually is: a perfectly organized system directed by a superior being who controls everyone who are just muppets and everything is part of this total plot in which something is pretended for me. For those brief moments everything is so clear and undeniably true for me. After it I seem to come back to actual reality and kinda push the experience back in my mind but it isnt really gone. 

That is the formula that always repeat in each of the experiences, depending on the context the content may be different. While im ""on the actual reality"" i can only recall some of them and partially, but when i fall into this paranoia the memories of every other time i fell are really clear and it all connects perfectly. 

  
I have done LSD before and i recognize them as similar experiences but i haven't done acid for little less than a year and it keeps happening in a lot different situations, both sober and high (on weed, which doesnt seem to make that state appear, only make it longer). I've also done DMT more than a year ago.

  
Im also regularly in contact with people diagnosed with psychosis, i work with some and im friends with others, i cant recall said experiences happening around them but it might be relevant.

I used to take this a bit as a game, just some side effects on the drugs I used (never abused though, never consumed more than once every 2 or 3 months and that was between 2018 and beginnings of 2019), a chance of expansion of conciousness. But now a lot of time has passed and they just keep kicking in and I think the depersonalization might have been taking parts of my life without noticing. 

If anyone has any suggestions on what to do and/or similar experiences i would appreciate it. Thanks for reading.",19Jan2020,1

Her legs shake and look weak and also left her left leg up. But she can still walk but not very far.Her paws would slide and ground down her back paw nails.Mona would not get up on her own will,she was in pain,she didn’t look happy.But she was eating,drinking and had a little excitement here and there.But she is a lab and they are very good at hiding pain and suffering.I was with her on the couch the night before kissing,hugging,and feeding her pizza.Today i did the same but on her bed until the vet came. It was a very peaceful death she first sedated Mona.Mona was on her bed and snoring from the sedatives.the vet then found a hard mass behind her knee and thought thats why she couldn’t put weight on her left leg.We didn’t notice because it was deep inside and mona would not let us touch that leg.then came the death shot i was crying petting and kissing her until her final breath she didn’t move or make any sounds it was very peaceful.I saw her lifeless body and it look like she was asleep.finally i gave her one last kiss and carried her to her coffin.We put her blanket,and stuffed puppy in there with her.Then we put her in her favorite spot in the backyard.I miss her so much i cant go to sleep and i keep replaying her death in my head.I am only 17 and this is the most traumatic thing i have gone through.So anyone who has lost a pet how did you cope.",19Jan2020,1
32,"I moved away from my home state just over a year ago to be with my girlfriend. We are 2+ years strong now, and have had multiple conversations planning out our future. We both have good jobs, and solid plans to excel in our fields. I have been planning to propose to her at the end of April; essentially putting together what she has described as her dream proposal. 

Well it seems that my profession has proven to take a higher toll on my mental health than I anticipated (EMS), and my already baseline abrasive demeanor has gotten worse; even when I don't notice it. I've dealt with aggressive bouts of depression even before moving, and I've found myself in an extensive depressive state for quite some time now. 

My girlfriend literally just made it known that she doesn't see me as the guy she fell in love with anymore, and hasn't for the past 5-6 months or so. Don't get me wrong, shes not talking about any time apart or separation. However, she has said shes disappointed with who i've shown myself to be. 

The thought of ever letting it get to this point makes me sick to my stomach, and ashamed doesn't even scratch the surface of how I feel. I want to get back to how it was in the beginning where I happily went full-blown romantic casanova with her.

Here's where I'm stuck: when I was at my peak Romeo phase, I was happy. I was energetic, excited, and creative with so much shit I did. Now, i'm miserable 24/7. I need to fix myself in order to fix us, but I whole-heartedly don't know how. I talk to councilors and close friends/family, i'm on antidepressants, and I try my hardest to find stuff to be happy about, but just can't. 

I know this is a complete stretch to ask, but does anybody have any input on how I can be happy enough to propose to my girlfriend?",19Jan2020,1
33,"For a couple of days now, I (17F) have been in a relationship with this guy (20M), who I don't know very long myself. Amongst a few other things that raise concern (we will get there), yesterday he said something that made me worry. He asked if I sometimes see the sky as red or blue (he meant the night sky, and not just that colour in a certain place, like, the whole damn sky).
I also recall that another symptom of schizophrenia is incoherent speech. I'm not sure about this one as much. I speak rather eloquently so I'm not sure if I'm exaggerating or anything, but sometimes, he really doesn't make sense.
Another major concern of mine: he likes to fight people. He mentions very often how much he does. He even said to me that he often hopes for people to provoke him just so he can get into a fight. Something that relates to this is also the amount of injuries he has had. Yesterday he also told me about one time he 'accidentally' stabbed himself with a hunting knife, and having to go to hospital. When I asked what happened, he didn't explain , simply went ""nothing "".

Any advice on the situation would be dearly appreciated. My mental health is fairly poor ( has been for quite some time) and I don't thing that I am ready to deal with his problems.

On the outside, I’m “normal”. When opportunities for promotion present themselves, coworkers ask me why I don’t go for them. After all, I’m almost 30, I’m not in school, I don’t have another job, I don’t have any kids, and I look healthy enough. Each time, I awkwardly try to explain that I have anxiety, but I don’t think people understand the extent of it.

I really do want to get a full time job someday (preferably at my current workplace), but I don’t think I’m ready yet. Maybe I am ready, but too afraid to take the next step, because I like working here, and don’t want to leave my company if I’m not able to handle it. Or maybe I’m not ready, and never will be. Are there people who try to work full time, but despite their best efforts, can’t do it?

40,"I don’t remember when thoughts like this first started, all I know is that they never stopped. Whenever I’m around my Dad, I feel uneasy, just imagining him touching me makes me feel scared. I try to cover up when he’s around. Once I had to wear leggings to take a family picture, I cried in my room because I didn’t want him to see me. And I usually wear leggings a lot to school, so when I get home, I make sure to hide from him to get to my room and change into baggy clothing. 

He’s never really done anything to provoke these thoughts, I mean, when puberty hit me, he commented on how big my boobs were, but back then, it didn’t make me feel uncomfortable. Then, I discovered I only felt this way around him, I didn’t feel this way around the boys at my school, or the sketchy men I walked by in the street, it was just him. 

And then, when I thought things couldn’t get any worse, I started feeling the same way around my little brother, who’s younger by 4 years and is in grade 6. I wasn’t scared of him raping me, but I was scared of him sexualizing me. I began to feel so uncomfortable around them, I made sure to never to wear anything tight around them. I even walked around the house wrapped in a giant blanket that completely covered me one week. 

My Mom got mad at me for wearing baggy clothes around the house, saying I looked homeless. She didn't want someone to see me like that. I told her a while back about these feelings, but it looks like she didn't take them into consideration. I’m not going to even bother to tell her about it again, because I feel like she wouldn't care. 

So, I’m conflicted. I don’t want my Mom to get mad at me for wearing baggy clothes, but I don’t want to wear tight clothing and feel so uncomfortable.

I am generally a pretty open person around people, at my work, at university, in day-to-day life, etc. The moment I walk through my door at the end of the week, I break. I become a dark shell of a person. I close my eyes and they open again on Monday morning. 

I have told my parents and friends about this and its always the same fucking thing. 

""You need to relax during that time (the weekend) off"" ""Find something you enjoy""

I used to be a gamer, especially when I was in high school. But now I look at my gaming rig and I just can't bring myself to turn it on. I forced myself today to play something, relaxing. I stopped after 10 mins because I wasn't enjoying it. 

It doesn't stop there, I tried all sorts of different things outside of gaming that I used to enjoy, a lot. Nothing. Its like all I want to do is lay in my bed. 

And so here I lay. That wouldn't be an issue either if I could just relax but I can't. My mind runs constantly. I stare at the ceiling, the wall, my phone, my gaming rig. And I feel like I'm my day is unfulfilled but I'm not strong enough or I don't care enough to do anything about it.

46,"My girlfriend just had a major episode/breakdown. She suffers greatly from abandonment issues and broke down crying hysterically for an hour or more, along with cutting herself slightly with a scissor (I was unaware of this at the time).

I am to blame as I just didn’t have the energy to console her when she needed me. We both were feeling a bit annoyed with each other once we got home from visiting my relatives. She wished me a goodnight a few hours later as a means to talk and be warm, but I wasn’t ready to talk as of yet. So this lead her to have a major episode. It was major because I still didn’t want to reaffirm her right away as I always do. This is very draining on me; always having to sacrifice my emotions, to help her feel better that she didn’t do anything wrong and not to worry about it. It feels like I’m never allowed to feel my emotions because she takes it personal as if she did something wrong and as if we have to break up right away (abandonment issues). 

So this time I just held out longer in apologizing while she was in the next room crying and cutting herself. Even after I checked on her and started to reassure her, it wasn’t enough to stop her from trying to leave, and crying even more, much more. 

In the end, I was able to console her and she feels much better and is asleep now. While I’m left feeling very drained, tremendously sadden for her wishing I can take away her pain, and be a better partner. But it all gets very draining. I’m human too and have my emotions and own issues. It’s very hard to put my emotions aside to help her feel better in a time when I should be allowed to feel my emotions. 

I also feel very emotional for her as her family is shit. She lost her sister to cancer when they were young, her mother abandoned her at a young age and her father is a narcissist. She’s in so much pain. I just wish I can be better for her, but scared as well that I can’t keep doing this. I suffer myself from issues and this is just too much pain. 

Her pain saddens me. She’s such an amazing person. Has so much potential. But is lost in thoughts and emotions out of her control. 

On top of it all, It’s so damn hard to find a decent place for her to go to for therapy. She has insurance but many places offer such bad care. If anyone knows of anything good trauma related therapy locations in NYC please let me know.

Things were going fairly decent until November and I was hoping they kinda rebound but they just aren't.

Been told most of my life how hated I am or how stupid I am or how much of an accident I was. I was abandoned when I was 8, with the justification that I was better off in that situation. Found out when I was 16 my father wasn't my father. Then been pretty much discarded by everyone and anyone once they've got what they need out of me or when I just can't handle the abuse.

I don't know how far away I am from a relapse but I don't see it too far off. I started drinking again a month and a half ago. Then I've been abusing my suboxone as well.

Feel stupidly alone, isolated and most off all just no one (including absolutely anyone in my family even the ones that say they are there when I need them) even care. Don't even have anyone to talk to and when I do. I either just get screamed at or told I'm not trying hard enough.

51,"Hey all. I'm coming off of a really terrible night. It is me and my girlfriend's fourth anniversary, and last night was the best night we've had in such a long time. I have been growing closer to her and honestly been starting to think about marriage. Well, we got tipsy over dinner and I brought up marriage and we were having a really good discussion about it, and then I brought up that if we got married her debt and mine would consolidate and I would have to start paying more. I didn't word this well. Well, I'm an idiot. And she didn't take this well. Her father commit suicide around seven or eight years ago, and debt was one of the major reasons. So I try to smooth it over and it's not going well, and I'm making about me being upset. I had to go to the bathroom to have a panic attack about ruining another anniversary (last year I also did something stupid to ruin it). Things escalated, my girlfriend started talking to me very harshly on the street, I walked away in a panic, she got upset with me for leaving her alone on a scary street in a strange city. We took a cab home and things got worse, I started hitting myself, she was hurt by this, and it culminated in me saying I wish I were dead. This is the one thing I had always told myself I would never say to her. I have suicidal ideation sometimes, but I just slipped out and I never wanted to say that to her. She tried to grab me while I was flailing and I shoved her away, which brings back trauma of a past relationship I had where it was mutually abusive and it ended terribly. She won't talk to me, I'm terrified she won't forgive me, and I probably deserve it. I'm sorry for such a long post but we were supposed to go in the hot tub tonight and go on adventures tomorrow but I think I ruined it all, I took it all away and I'll never get this vacation back.

Imagine getting a girlfriend way out of your league who isn't your type just so you don't feel as fucking alone! WoW! Maybe that's a bit shitty of me.. no helping it now! Everyone acts all nice until they realize certain things! Sure! I drew the short end of the stick, almost every time! So what! Don't gotta call me that! 

How about you stitch your dirty mouth shut, you whore!

Spiraling like this, feels really good doesn't it! Too bad I need to go back to conformity soon! Oh sob for me! How boring will that be? Wonder how long I'll last this time! Want to take a bet? A day? Not even a day?

60,"Hey everyone I (23 year old female) just wanted to ask some advice. I think I have bipolar type 2 disorder. I have the low moods, and the hypo manic stages, and I also have a family history of mental health conditions.

I just wanted to ask, can this condition be managed without medication? I don't want the side effects and the diagnosis that comes attached to the meds.
I have a good support system. I function really well, I work full time and am completing my second degree. I live a healthy and active lifestyle, and I can identify my moods when they happen.

I've just been reading into the condition and I'm concerned my mental health will deteriorate with just lifestyle management. 

What do you guys think? I could really use some hope now😊

61,"A long time ago I was a happy kid making As and Bs in school and I was a little socially awkward but not too bad to even make friends. About when I started middle school I started growing in height but not very much in weight, I was very tall and skinny. I was slowly getting worse and worse. Fastforward to 2016 I am a complete shut in besides going to school and occasionally talking to my parents I had basically no human contact. I also had very little motivation to do anything. I was having what I now know are anxiety attacks. My family did not know what was going on until I had one in front of them a couple years ago. 

I obviously left out many details but you probably understand my situation. I was stuck in this situation for a long time, middle through highschool. I thought it was all normal or because of my weight.

In 2019 I switched schools which made me so happy. It was the first time in years I didn't have a constant feeling of anxiety. I got a job, started talking to people, like random people I was walking by. I got to a normal weight. I again became the hyper and creative kid I once was. If there is something you know is making your life terrible get the hell away from it. Im open to answering questions in the comments.",19Jan2020,1
62,"Little background : I'm 18 years old, I started watching porn at the age of 11 but I didn't have good internet back then so it was mostly masturbating to my imagination. At first it was no problem. Then soon I started getting overwhelmed by the feelings and I couldn't stop myself from watching porn even if others were sitting next to me ( obviously they didn't have clear view of the screen or me. )

Soon after I started getting into relationships. At first I thought that I really was in love with every girl from them, but recently I realized that I never felt love, it was just extremely strong sexual impulses. I never grabbed women or forced them or anything like that, but the thoughts never stopped. Never. For 7 freaking years, it's only been getting worse. A lot worse. 

Sex and porn have been basically controlling my life. I stopped looking at women as other people whom I can form an emotional connection with. It was just the sex. As soon as I feel myself getting attached or something I gotta bail because I knew that it wasn't love it was just sexual. 

Anyway I lost my V card at like 15 or so. It was horrible. Not because I didn't know what to do or because I didn't like the girl I was with, but because I didn't feel anything. I was thrusting like an animal but I still didn't feel anything. The first time I did it like that for 15 minutes and I just told her to stop. Second time I did it for a long time and I still didn't feel anything. 

What I feel guilty about though is that sometimes I get a little rough during sex, like choking her and pulling her head closer when she's giving me a BJ until she gags. I don't mean to do it like that, I just get caught in the moment a lot.

What's really bad though is the amount of times it gets me in embarrassing situations, like getting caught kissing someone at school, having sex in the school bathroom, almost getting caught masturbating, people asking me why I take too long in the bathrooms, the countless times I got to school late because I woke up with a boner and had to jerk it off away because it hurts, not eating lunch because I spent lunch time jerking off ..

It's ruining my life, even when I was meaning to do homework and stuff I either start watching porn or get caught up sexting someone. 

I'm basically the guy from the movie ""shame"". I'm even at the later stage at the end of the movie where females don't even satisfy anymore ..",19Jan2020,1

64,"I don't know that many people - at least not as much as a normal person in their early 20s should know - but pretty much every single one of them is currently in therapy, has had therapy, or is trying to look for a therapist.

It's crazy. And it's just so depressing for me. Nobody is really well, most people have an insane amount of bagagge, and in this city, take a shitload of speed, ketamine and/or ecstasy to at least try to combat it. 

I honestly am feeling kind of overwhelmed. On one side, I am beginning to have social life for the first time ever. On the other, it just made me realize how fucked many people I know are. 

Thing is, I try to have a ""healthy"" relationship with drugs. They're fun, and limit my usage as much as I can, but I can feel greed and probably a bit of peer pressure starting to get to me. I just don't know if I'll be able to not sink into the depths of this city. But I don't want to quit either.

I'm just so, so afraid of my last resistance to crumble. I do fantasize about hurling my body off the 8th story of an abandoned office complex in the industrial outskirts more frequently than I'd like to admit - I know which train to take, which way to walk, which window to climb into. I could be done in about half an hour, easy. Just numb myself and do it. While it is a very comforting thought, it definitely isn't a healthy one.

73,"does anyone else have this thing where they are paranoid about the safety of food?

I can eat the foods, but if I - at any point - get an idea in my head that it may not be safe (cooking chicken etc) I'm paranoid about it nd it makes me really struggle to eat it.

Particular foods include rice, pasta, chicken, pork, eggs, untoasted crumpets and muffins, oranges, bananas and more I can't even think of right now.

one example is of rice I was cooking for a curry. it was boiling and I strained it, and I tried a bit to see if it was cooked. It was still a bit hard to chew - meaning I hadn't left it long enough. This automatically made me extremely paranoid about its safety. I told my self to get over it, and it would be fine and served up my dinner. I got about 2 mouthfuls in and started thinking about it again. I literally couldn't eat the rice, so put it to the side, I was going to eat the chicken but then started worrying that the chicken wasn't cooked either, even though it was obvious it was. I ended up binning the entire dinner and having toast that night.

It's awful. My mum was eating boiled eggs the other day, and she said if was a bit runner than she liked. I automatically got really paranoid and worried that she was going to get ill from it. She is fine, and said it was cooked just funnier, but I saw it that it was raw. And she was going to get food poisoning.",19Jan2020,1

77,"Read my previous posts and you will see pretty much depressive posts exclusively. A week ago I had a breakdown that left me afraid I would hurt myself soon. It was unbelievably scary. The day after, on Monday, I felt all calm and relaxed. It was so weird. Less than a day before I was crying my eyes out feeling afraid I would hurt myself. Now, here I was, calm and relaxed. Not only did I feel calm and relaxed, but I also felt optimistic. I felt like this is the year I will see improvements. I turn 24 in a few weeks, and so far, my 20’s have been just full of depressive periods. But... 2020 is the year things will change. I am going to start making friends and, after I’ve started making friends, I am going to start dating people. And this is all happening this year. I’ve been a loner for 14 years, but I won’t be a loner for 15 years. This is the year everything changes.

I don’t think I’ve ever felt this optimistic about my social and my romantic life. Certainly not in many, many years. I had completely given up. I’ve been trying to accept life as a loner for years now. This is very weird but also very real. Perhaps it’s the fact that, because of how I felt on Sunday in regards to harming myself, I know I cannot allow for anything else to happen. It HAS to work. And it HAS to work this year. I’m not sure I could go on like this for another year or two. So this will be the year things changes.

What have I done so far? I’ve reached out to my cousin who has never been in a similar situation. She is very kind and supportive and has offered to help me through this. I will start attending a biweekly gaming evening at the university, and I will also attend a speed friending event at the university next month. I do my best to keep negativity out of my life now. Anyone who doesn’t seem supportive or is kind of negative towards me will be out of my life. Oh and I also want to see if there is any speed dating events in my city. Not the biggest city in the world but I am sure there must be something. If not, I will check out some online dating stuff and ask my cousin for some help. Or maybe my new group of friends will be helpful too. Perhaps one of them is someone I’d be interested in dating. Or perhaps some of them know someone looking for a date.

My mental is health is not as stable as it should be, i have been feeling quite depressed lately depite being proud that I have almost graduated college. I have social anxiety and i’m super anxious on doing these internships.

I tried doing my first internship last year but literally anything that could have gone wrong, did go wrong. The people were always yelling at me and being verry rude. I got jobs that had nothing to do with my education, they pushed me in other rooms to do irrelevant shit to get rid of me and on top of all that they told stories about me that weren’t true at all. It felt like I was back in highschool, this one time, these adults would sat at a table during lunch, i would go sit at their table and try to socialise despite my anxiety. When they saw me they all got up, and sat at another table leaving me alone. 

Ofcourse me being a instable anxious mess, had anxiety and panick attacks on the daily. I left crying, cried all night and cried when i had to back. Eventuelly i ended this internship, failed the course and had to do an extra year of college.

Now a year later I have to try again. I’m terrified and i don’t know how to get through this. This internship lasts 3 months, the next one lasts 6 months. After this i can finally graduate... but i just don’t know how to get through this..

I went to my primary doctor the other day about my frequent memory loss.  During this visit the doctor told me that I have had anxiety disorder, and has diagnosed me with it a while ago, but I wasn't informed (or he told me and I forgot.  go figure). He said I need a Neurocognitive evaluation. On Friday, after calling out from work to handle important things, I had probably the worst day in my life in a VERY LONG time, and had, I guess it was, a 3.5 hour anxiety attack. So now I'm also wanting to get on anxiety medicine because I don't want my life held hostage for hours by any more attacks.

The big problem is it has been affecting my work badly. I'm forgetting things, and it's greatly straining my job position. I keep getting talked to and they are getting more serious and I feel I'm getting very close to having my job in jeopardy.  **I can't lose my job**.  I'm moving into a studio apartment in a week to get out of a bad living situation.  If I lose my job, or even get demoted I won't be able to afford the place.

So, tomorrow I am calling a Psychiatrist office near my new apartment about anxiety medicine.  I am also waiting to hear from my health insurance about a where I can go to do the evaluation that is in-network. I can't go to an emergency room because the visit would financially make it where I can't pay the 1st month rent. But work has expressed that the expectation of my job requires me to be able to handle it immediately. I'm thinking they are tired of my explication/excuses even though they say they are supportive. (""We are supportive, but we need to have these things you are messing up fixed now"").

So....is there a paperwork I can ask the psychiatrist and psychologist when I see them that says ""Here is what we are working on to correct Triox's mental problems, and it may take some time to kick in"" that I can give to my job, so that they can't just write me up/fire me on the next mistake?

I can safely say that I don't know what it feels like to be safe anymore, and because I often go out by myself I feel it's easier for people to potentially take advantage of me being by myself for their own benefit. At the moment it feels like safety is a luxury or a desire as opposed to a nesescity at the moment and that concerns me, because I feel like I should be able to leave my house and not feel in danger constantly.  I'm sick of trying to stay strong , as it where, when all I feel like doing is slitting my skin untill I bleed out and die from blood loss.

i was dumped 2 days ago, by someone i thought was the love of my life. recently, my mental health was getting worse, i was overthinking more, i was crying more, i was pulling myself away more. this has happened before, a year prior. when i met my former boyfriend, i told him when i was low, and i said i may be like that again. he promised to stay and look after me if it ever happens. we never argued, we never had disagreements, when we were sad we talked it out. everyone thought we would last. everyone thought we were soulmates. so did we. i have been diagnosed with having anxiety, depression, and being hyper sensitive. 
around November 2019, i started to dip into my depression again. i told him this, he supported me, he said he’d never leave. he spent everyday together, he held me and made me feel okay again. i told him if i ever get too much, he could tell me. he promised me he would never give up on me. i believed him. he started talking to his ex on snapchat, but they were together only in the 2nd year of high school. so a while ago now, they were 13. but he said he was really hurt by her. i started seeing a physiologist again, once a week. but i felt it didn’t help. but he was so proud of me, i was doing it for him. 
January 14th, he said that he was starting to be in a bad mindset too, and that he believed my mental illness was caused by him. we nearly broke up, but i convinced him it wasn’t him, because it truly wasn’t. he stayed and everything felt normal again. but ever since then, i cried every night thinking that it would happen again, he would try leave me, i would be alone. January 17th, he came to my house, i cried constantly because i felt he was going to leave me, but he held me and he promised me he’d never ever leave me. i believed him. i fell asleep in his arms, and i woke up crying even harder, believing he would leave and he held me tighter and told me he never would. he cuddled me while my father drove him home, the last thing he said was “i love you, i’ll never leave” and he got out the car and put his hands into a heart shape and waved goodbye, walked into his house. that night he told me he wasn’t feeling great, i told him to speak to his mother because she might be able to help. his mother said he should break up with me, i don’t know why. that night, i called him, sobbing my eyes out, my mother had to come and talk to him because i couldn’t. i cried so hard. he left me and told me he felt he wasn’t good enough. we were together for nearly a year. nothing felt real in the situation. he wouldn’t stop saying how much he loved me, how much he cared for me, how he never wanted to leave but thought he had to, to work on himself. i let him. but my heart won’t let me leave him alone. i keep messaging him, telling him how i feel, how worried i am about him. i’ve been speaking to him ever since, i know it’s wrong. but he’s been talking to me too, he’s been replying to my private story, when he sees i’m sad. i tell him he shouldn’t be he tells me he wants to. he tells me he still loves me, he misses me. but today i asked him if he still saw a future with me, he said he didn’t know, he didn’t think so. but only because he thought he wasn’t good enough, he feels i’m still good enough for him, but he’s no good for me. he was my happiness while the world was falling down. i can’t sleep, i can’t eat, i worry so much about him. i worry he will never come back, like i will never become better again. i miss him. but he’s blocked him location from me, he says he needs space. he’s taken me off his private stories, but he says he still wants on mine. he still says he loves me, he cares for me. his feelings haven’t changed. he never lies. i’m so scared, i don’t know what to do. i don’t want to be replaced. i keep feeling like his ex will replace me, i know they speak a lot, i’m scared she’s part of the reason why he’s gone. he keeps telling me he still loves me, he still misses me. but he says he’ll never come back. 
i speak to my mother and dad who have both been through mental health and relationships with it, they say they think he will come back, to give him time. they saw how much he cared for me, they thought themselves we would last. they treated him like a son. i don’t know what to do guys, someone else give me advise. i keep checking on him, when i was still able to, i kept checking his location, to see if he was okay. not to hurt himself, if he was with his ex, if he was ignoring me. if he was okay. i’m still so so so worried. i miss him so much, and i want him back so bad. i need him so bad right now. i’m heart broken. can someone please give me advise. please don’t hate on me, i’m trying my best to get through this. but i still believe he was my soulmate, and he even says he still believes too. is his mental health taking over his feelings? or will he really never come back? someone please help. i need help. thank you for reading",19Jan2020,1

91,"Last night I did it again. It's my anniversary and I sabotaged a wonderful dinner with the love of my life by being insensitive and then overreacting when she got upset with me, all in a public place. Read more here: https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/eqtwsg/i_need_help.

I did something similar last year on our anniversary. And we went on vacation after that and I had a big meltdown there, too. Thankfully she's forgiving, but I feel like eventually she'll get sick of it and leave. I wouldn't blame her. This time was probably the worst it's ever been.

I want this to stop more than anything. Does anyone have any advice? I may have ADD or some kind of personality disorder, in these instances it feels like my emotions have taken the wheel and I'm in the backseat watching them blow through stop signs.

Ill try not to go on a massive rant but basically I feel like I can't connect with anyone, I graduated university a couple of years back and my job (due to me being self employed) is not very social so meeting new people is hard, plus the fact that I can be shy and introverted does not help at all. 

I keep trying to crawl out of these episodes where I feel so low and unworthy, comparing myself to other people who are more successful than me, have great social skills/life, have immense confidence but I still fall into these pits and from most of what I read and watch they all state that a close support group is essential in helping to deal with these issues but it feels like I have no one that cares or understands me. At the moment I am focusing on my work and trying to get my career going and to be fair I have been trying to cultivate a routine of waking up early mediating and working out and I have been on track mostly but on days like these I just give up because I feel like there is no point. I will die lonely and depressed with nothing to show for it.

94,"Hello, this is my first ever post on Reddit! Be gentle with me... 

Basically, I am struggling with my life a bit at the moment, and I don’t really have anyone to talk to about it - I don’t like talking to my family about personal stuff, and I don’t have any friends with whom I’d feel comfortable talking about myself, and not feel like a nuisance. Strangers on the internet it is, then.

To give you some backstory, I am an early-thirties female who has always been prone to feelings of sadness, loneliness, unfulfillment - though I am hesitant to use the word ‘depressed’ because I have never been suicidal, think I do have some worth, and have always hoped that life will get better and I will be happy someday.

Nothing really bad has happened to me, but life has been quite disappointing so far - I grew up with a difficult father who was sometimes abusive, and a mother who always defended him and dismissed my concerns about his behavior (and still does). I was unpopular at school, then I went to university, which I thought was going to be wonderful, but it turned out to be a complete disappointment. After university I had a string of unfulfilling jobs. I’m an honest person, and I know my lack of professional success is partly due to laziness - but I also think that getting a job and being successful professionally has a lot to do with luck and being in the right place at the right time, and I think I’ve also been really unlucky. I tried for a while to get into the museum/heritage sector and did quite a bit of volunteering, and a few years back I tried to get into library work and applied for some library traineeships, none of which I got so much as an interview for.

The best thing I have done in my adult life is to get the frick out of my home country (England) and away from my family 6 years ago. I travelled Asia, lived in Australia for a while and then two years ago I moved to France, where I currently am. 

Oh, did I mention that I’ve never had a boyfriend? Yeah.

I have mostly worked as a waitress since coming to France but a few months ago I decided to train as an EFL teacher. It was a month-long intensive course, which I had to stay in a different European city to do as the city I live in doesn’t offer it. It was one of the hardest, but also one of the best things I have ever done. I had 9-5 classes every day and spent most of my evenings and weekends studying, so it was stressful, but it also felt great to be so busy and have so much going on in my life. The other people on my course were all lovely and, although I stayed in an apartment by myself, I never got lonely, because I was so busy and had plenty of interaction with my coursemates. It was everything my university experience wasn’t. 

Anyway, since coming back from the course a couple of months ago, I have struggled to live my life productively. I should be feeling excited about my new career and finally having a profession, but I’m not. My life has gone from full to empty. A language school in my city has given me a few classes to teach, but I’m still only working a couple of hours a week and am mostly relying on benefits to survive. My EFL course showed me that I AM capable of working hard and using my time wisely - I had no choice because otherwise I’d have failed the course - but, when I have the option of doing nothing, I just do nothing. My worst habits are waking up late (like 11am), and spending most of my waking hours lying in bed playing with my smartphone. Even when I ban myself from social media sites, I still find other ways to waste time on the internet. Despite almost all my time being free, I struggle to get anything done and feel as though I have ‘no time’ for anything.

Unsurprisingly, these behaviors are making me feel like shit. I am also suffering from a lack of social interaction. I haven’t made many friends since moving to my current city two years ago, and I haven’t socialised since I came back from my course two months ago (apart from spending one week with my family at Christmas). The vast majority of my time is spent alone (I rent a room through a property guardianship organization and don’t speak much to the other people in my building). 

Oh, and being a British citizen in France with Brexit looming is not exactly doing wonders for my mental state.

I’m stuck in a rut that I desperately want to get out of. Even without a job, I could still be living a much fuller and happier life - applying for jobs, reading, making art, going for walks, meeting friends, cooking - not staying indoors not speaking to anyone and staring at my phone (much as I am doing at this very second).

I desperately want to be ‘living my best life’ (corny expression, but I like it) but I think that right now the most important thing for me is to get more teaching work so that my life has more structure, and start socializing again. But in order to do that I really need to overcome the toxic habits mentioned above that are hindering my productiveness and making me feel like crap. Today was the first day I didn’t even bother to shower, get dressed or make even a token attempt at productivity. 

To anyone who has read this far, thank you, reading back through this word-vomit I think I just feel lonely and wanted to reach out to someone, and if anyone can help me with things like getting up early, curing my smartphone addiction and being more productive, I’d be very grateful.",19Jan2020,1

97,"I often run into situations where I need to learn several things, and will tackle them one at a time (after multi tasking produced no results). Once I've sufficiently learned one thing, pretty much mastered it, I move onto the next thing...and slip on what I learned before until it's as if I never learned it. I seem to be only be capable of focusing on one time at a time, EVER, and can never learn something new without losing my ability to do what I just mastered.

This has been an issue in jobs and therapy (anything with skill learning) and relationships where I need to put effort into changing my behavior. School was somewhat easy because I didn't have to retain info from one semester to the next. Because of my inability to learn and make it stick, my longest relationship was 1.5 years and my longest job was maybe 5 months. Yet, my doctors don't seem to think I have attention issues that are separate from anxiety and they never felt this way. But this feels like more than just attention problems.

I don't know how this happened or if I've always been like this. I know I was on Lithium for 6 weeks and didn't respond well to it, even going to the ER for suspected lithium toxicity at one point (they decided that my lithium levels were actually lower than normal since I puked so much), and I swear I haven't felt ""with it"" since but 1. No one believes me, they think it's an excuse and 2. I don't know what can be done about it. I also wonder if just the wear and tear that 2 decades of mental illness has had on my brain could be a cause. I'm currently unmedicated because I had genetic testing done that showed I don't metabolize most psych meds at prescribable doses, and once I was yanked off the meds I really hoped there'd be a change. Nope. None.

Has anyone experienced this, and has anyone found a solution?",19Jan2020,1

Hey guys, this might be one of the craziest posts that you have ever read on here (I am pretty sure). First, I have suffered from severe health anxiety and OCD my whole life (I am 21). Basically, I get super scared when something happens to my health, even if there is no apparent reason. What does this have to do with hookah? Let me explain...

An incident happened exactly 3 years ago, where I fainted after taking deep hits in a hookah bar (unexperienced smoker). After this incident, I lived perfectly fine for about 1,5 years. Then, I read some German articles that were published at the time which severely triggered my health anxiety. I then made this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/9v3fow/bad\_hookah\_experience\_should\_i\_be\_worried/](https://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/9v3fow/bad_hookah_experience_should_i_be_worried/)

The next months (I was taking a gap year after high school to build my business), I fell into a deep hole of anxiety and depression because I now thought that there was something wrong with me because of carbon monoxide poisoning (Which does not really make sense, since I never noticed anything being wrong with me during that 1.5 year span: I excelled in high school, built a business on the side, even got into a highly ranked university). You can read it in the post, but after I fainted, I felt perfectly fine (no more symptoms), so I did not go to the ER. Basically, in the articles it says that you have to get oxygen treatment immediately after, to get the CO out of your system, otherwise you risk permanent brain damage/cognitive issues etc.. I did not know that at the time, and since I was feeling so good after fainting, I thought I had just oversmoked (I was blowing rings and holding the smoke in) , so I did not go to the ER, which I now DEEPLY regret.

So I have talked to over 5 doctors about this, all of them told me I had nothing to worry about and even thought I was crazy lol. I was taking antidepressants for the first time to calm me down, and somehow after a few months I overcame my anxiety and started living normally again. I was super proud of myself and thinking ""how did you waste months dwelling on something that stupid??"" I was 10 months free of anxiety (just stopped thinking about it), doing super well, got into a highly university in September, got very good grades, but then in November, I was burning myself out because I was working/studying almost 100 hours per week, and then I started obsessing about that incident again. I had a complete mental breakdown because my thoughts were driving me crazy again, feelings of guilt: ""Why didnt you go to the ER??"", ""You are not as smart as you could have been...""

I began researching again, and became even more anxious. I was risking to drop out of university, started neglecting studying and socializing because my anxiety was just too much(How crazy does that sound??) Basically, now I am back on antidepressants and I began doing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with a psychiatrist to help me. I know this is a mental illness that I have (OCD), but it was triggered again only because of some stupid incident in a hookah bar. At the time, I did not think of it as a big deal (the articles were not published back then), but me being a hypochondriac, I just cannot deal with scary health information that I read online.

I have not smoked ever since, because it has left me truly traumatized. I really think I developed some form of PTSD because of it. I know that I am overly exaggerating things but I just wish I had never touched a hookah (even though I enjoyed it from time to time), because of all the stress it has brought me. As an extremely anxious person, I have never done any drugs etc. and since hookah is a really big thing here (70% of all 18-25 yr olds have tried it at least once here), I never thought that I was putting my health at a bigger risk. I really feel like I am stuck in the past, unable to look forward. My anxiety is telling me to go see another 10 doctors, but I know that it will not change shit. I just want to live my life again without thinking that there is something wrong with my health.

Sometimes I want to go back and change it, but I cannot... I know that fainting has happened to many people from smoking hookah, and that it can have various reasons (lack of oxygen, nicotine, standing up too quickly etc.), but the fact that it could have been carbon monoxide poisoning is just making me nuts (I cannot even google it anymore because it makes me feel extremely anxious). I have never put drugs inside my body, but at this point I see myself having damaged my health the same way as a heroin addict.

It is quite ironic that the thing that I used to calm down on the weekends ends up giving me the most stress in my life. I do not know why I am even making this post. Maybe I just want people telling me that I am in fact crazy, which I already know. Maybe its just to distract me from googling specialists in hyperbaric oxygen treatment in my area, which I have already done several times this week. Or maybe I just wanted to share my crazy obsessive thoughts that have tortured me for the last months/years and that I was never able to share with anyone. I am feeling a bit hopeless, not gonna lie.

The antidepressants are working well and I am doing a bit better now. I just have to get my shit together and not let a single incident dictate the rest of my life (I mean, there are people that had way worse things happen to them??). I overcame this anxiety once, so chances are, that I will be able to do it again... If someone has some helpful life advice, I would really appreciate it. If not, then at least I have provided you with an insight as to how OCD thoughts can mess somebody up...",19Jan2020,1

IThis is really hard for me to write because I don’t know if I’m overreacting. I probably am. I’m sorry.....but here goes.


I’m an 18 year old college student and I had a rough time with my family growing up.  My dad worked and my mom stayed home, meaning my mom was my primary parent I was around. 


I grew up being spanked, and I don’t think that is abusive in and of itself, but I remember her chasing me around the apartment with a ruler/belt because I was afraid. I remember being yelled at a lot when I made mistakes. Not like raising your voice, but her just going completely off on me. I said the phrase “screwed up” and i didn’t realize what it meant and that it was “bad” because I was literally 7 years old, and i got completely chewed out in the car in front of my cousin.


From when I was 12 until now, my relationship with my mom deteriorated. I had anxiety and depression, and she ignored it. Made me feel like a mistake. She would scream at me if I forgot to wash a pan or left cups in my room. She was never patient. If I cried she would tell me that I shouldn’t be crying and that I was overreacting. She would skew the story when telling my dad to get him on my side, and when I cried he would get mad as well.


They eventually let me get medicated for my mental health, but they never tried to help me besides that. Never talked to me about it, and always told me how “hopefully you’ll be off the medication soon because it’s bad for you and it costs money.” Never hoping I was feeling better for myself - always making me feel guilty about my depression and anxiety.


It never really got physical. My mom hit me a few times in the car when she got angry, which scared the heck out of me. She always threatened “the belt”, but because after 13 I was old enough to resist “the belt” she never actually went through with it. The last time I was spanked, I was 13.


If I cried too loud, she would tell the that the neighbors would call the cops and take me away. It used to get me to stop crying, but when I was 17 I told her to “let them” because I hated living with them so much.

104,"I moved back to my uni accommodation today and I feel incredibly stressed which is not good for my mental health. I think the stress of my uni accommodation did contribute to my deterioration last term and suicide attempt.

What's so bad? The heating still isn't working. On the 1st of january I was messaging my flatmate who was in the flat at the time who said the heating and hot water hadn't been working for several days. So I called the office (the third time we've had no heating since september) and they said they'd sort it. On the 7th I visited for the day and my flatmate said the heating still hadn't been fixed. So my dad talked to the landlord who came checked it out and it was working for a while.

Today when I arrived the heating wasn't working again, according to my flatmate it was working for a while but then stopped again (and they had some more issues with no hot water for several days). All my flatmates have fan heaters from the office however they do not have any left for me (there are apparently 5 fan heaters however there are 30 flats and about 150 residents and who knows how many are having heating issues this time round) so my dad bought one for me. Technically I am not allowed to own a fan heater but living in a freezing flat has been really damaging to my mental health and can affect my diabetes as well.

This might be a bit of a validation post, if I'm being honest. I'm angry and sad and very lost on what to do and feel seriously guilty and keep doubting myself on whether I actually want to do this.


I am a 16-year-old trans/nonbinary teenager. Please, if you're going to mention something about how I'm mentally ill or just trying to be trendy or some bullshit, leave. I don't want those comments because, frankly, I hear them every day and don't need to be reminded again. 


My parents don't fully know about my gender identity. I attempted to tell them when I was 14, but they basically told me I was just a tomboy and it has never been brought up again. My dad thinks being trans is a mental illness and transitioning to match your identity is equivalent to self harm. They know I've wanted a haircut for years. I bug my mom about it every couple days. My mom gets seriously angry at me for it because she's annoyed with my nagging, but I'm also annoyed because there are a lot worse things I could be doing to my body than just cutting my hair. I could be out fucking everyone who'll have me and getting a fucking drug addiction, but I'm not and never would. All I want is a damn haircut. She's straight-up told me, ""you're a girl and I don't want you to have a boy's haircut."" At least she's not using shitty excuses anymore and actually being honest. Doesn't make it any less ridiculous tho.


It's gotten to the level where I'm just angry all the time at everyone and everything because I feel so out of control. It's of course not *just* the hair that's causing it. It's a lot of things they've done that have hurt me, things that have affected my relationships with other people and my own mental health. Just the general knowledge that my parents refuse to accept me for who I am. The hair is just an offset of that.


I have a history of depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts and this whole ordeal has put me back into an extreme dark place. I'm worried for my own health at this point, and I know some people will see this and think ""come on -- it's just a haircut"", but it goes so much beyond that. It goes into feelings of never being good enough, of feeling like a trophy to my parents, of having my appearance matter more to them than my comfort, of just feeling extremely invaluable to them as a whole, of knowing that they do not show the same respect for me that I do for them. It's caused me to act out and get into rather large arguments with them lately and I feel sick and sad all the time.


Maybe this post doesn't even belong on this sub. I'm unsure of where I should post. But would I be the asshole if went and got my hair cut without their permission/against their explicit wishes?? Is it illegal for me to do so?? Would the hair stylist get in trouble because they cut a minor's hair without parents' permission?? I don't want anyone else to get in trouble due to my actions either. Should I just tough it out another couple years so I can get a haircut then??


Again, I think this is kind of a validation post and I apologize. I just need to know I'm not alone in this. I need to know that I'm not being stupid or sensitive.",19Jan2020,1
106,"I’m trying adaptogens mainly for my daily anxiety i get now, and maybe it’ll ease my depression.
I’m trying Rhodiola this time - i recently have tried Ashwagandha, Holy Basil and now this one.  Ashwagandha (300,600, then 1200 mg) i tried for 5 months.
Holy Basil (450mg) tried for 2 months. (started to get impatient bc no effect)
So the previous adaptogens have no had much luck with me. 

I’m not sure if it’s because I don’t know how to identify the feeling of relief from anxiety/depression, because i’ve had generalized anxiety &amp; low mood/depression most of my life so it’s like i REALLY don’t know or know how to know, the feeling of being ‘not depressed’ or ‘not anxious’ because i’ve always felt it. 

So i’m in day 5 &amp; been taking 300mg (1 capsule) to start, and when i hit 1 week or maybe even like 10 days, i will double the dose to the “recommended dose” given which is 600mg. 

If you’ve tried this, or any adaptogen really, what did you notice? 

Did you feel yourself not get worried about something that once did? 
Did it make you sleepy ? (heard it can have that calming affect but i have yet to experience that)
Was your dose the recommended amount or was it more/less?
Did you add any other adaptogens or herbal remedies that helped increase the adaptogenic affect ?

My girlfriend broke up with me yesterday, but it was my doing. We’d only been together for about two months or so, but the first month or so was just so incredible. She made me so happy and I was so sure I’d found my soulmate, life was looking very good for me - better than it ever has before. 

However, these intense feelings I had for her seemingly disappeared almost overnight, and I don’t know why. To go from feeling as amazing about her as I did to feeling nothing towards her has made me feel very empty. Life now seems boring and pointless and I have no motivation to do anything. The enjoyment has been sucked out of everything, not just the relationship I had with her. She tried to help me as best she can but nothing has worked, and she had to break up with me because she couldn’t handle how cold and distant I had become, and how I was unable to return her affection like I once could. I don’t blame her at all, she didn’t deserve this to happen to her and I feel so guilty that I’ve put her through this - I know that she’s heartbroken over it. 

The thing is, I feel even more empty and lonely without her, and I feel like I have nobody to turn to. All I’ve been able to do today is lay in bed feeling nothing. I can’t enjoy anything that I used to, and I’m barely able to even make myself eat at the moment. I just can’t see how I’m going to feel any better any time soon, or how this emptiness is going to go away, and it scares me because I think I’ve always been in a good place mentally until now.",19Jan2020,1
108,"I have reached that age where I'm the only one that can look out for myself and where no one will do anything to stop me from becoming homeless. When being a teenager they were like here take all this money, take this apartment, ur doctor wants to see you all the time but now it's daily worrying about where I'm supposed to live and if I'll actually get a job and that no one owes me anything.

Does anyone else feel like when you were a teenager it was okay to struggle ? but now as an adult there's all these responsibilities and there's no time for an inconvenience like mental illness. If I wasn't in a (somewhat) good place i don't know how I could do this. Whenenever I start to experience any symptoms I don't have time for that and something I too often think to myself is ""If you're still standing you can still do it"" which maybe sounds positive and great but when it's because I'm about to pass out or have a breakdown and I feel like I have no choice but to not feel like that then maybe it's not so great.

110,"Bulimia nervosa is almost a sort of mix of anorexia nervosa and binge-eating disorder. However, it distinguishes itself from these and other eating disorders through regular periods of binging (eating an excessive amount of food in a short period of time) and purging (trying to avoid gaining weight from the food through various methods)

Eating disorders are often pushed aside when it comes to mental health, and it's a shame because many people go without knowing that they have a problem. Many people view bulimia as eating a lot and then purging by puking which, yes, is one of the more common and dangerous forms of bulimia, but is not the only one.

There are two types of bulimia. Purging type includes self-induced vomiting, but can also be an abuse of laxatives or other medications of this type.

Non-purging type, harder to spot, includes excessive exercise or fasting. Exercise and fasting in itself are not harmful, but it is when it's used for the exclusive purpose of not gaining weight after a binging episode. These methods can easily become self destructive if used for the wrong reasons.

Please! Watch out for yourself and others! Non-purging type bulimia is still dangerous despite not involving purges and is much harder to spot than purging type, so please watch for any signs that you or someone else might be suffering.

Note: Bulimia is also not just purging and non-purging. Purging type can include non-purging methods, but non-purging type usually does not utilize purging methods.",19Jan2020,1

I'm currently taking celexa, trazodone, and birth control. Celexa for depression, trazodone for insomnia, and birth control just for my period cramps.

Trazodone works amazing for me, I always fall asleep whenever I want after I take it. It also always gives me vivid dreams while I sleep, which I used to never experience, so it's a nice touch.

I think my celexa works alright too, probably more than I realize. Sometimes I run out of, forget to take, or just don't feel like taking my meds and it's always a grave mistake. Only thing is is that I'm super tired, like, 24/7 now which is kind of the opposite of how I was before my meds. I'm not sure if this is a side effect of celexa or just the effects of trazodone bleeding into the next day.

Birth control is fine. I'm a lesbian anyway so I don't really need it to prevent pregnancy, but it helps tame my cramps and lighten my flow a lot.",19Jan2020,1
116,"The end of August my dad was in a car accident. He is 69, and was pretty banged up but he was expected to make a pretty decent recovery. He spent a week in the icu while he was recovering from the accident and getting surgeries to fix his wrist, hip and pelvis. After that they transferred him upstairs for 1 night of observation and then he was supposed to be discharged to a temporary rehabilitation facility. I was there when they moved him from the icu and stayed to make sure he was comfortable and had everything he needed. He started acting odd but I had someplace I had to be, so I went and talked to his nurse and told her I was concerned about his behavior and breathing. She sent respiratory in and I said my goodbye and left. I wasnt even 30 minutes down the road when I got a call that they couldn't find his heartbeat. He had stopped breathing shortly after I left, and wasnt being monitored. Their best guess is he was without oxygen for 27 minutes. He was in a medically induced coma for a few days while his body recovered. It took a few days after they stopped the meds for him to wake up. I was asked to ok a tracheotomy and having a feeding tube placed while he was under. Even after he woke up he was more or less a vegetable. On full vent and he would only occasionally follow movements. He has slowly gotten better, but he will never be the man I said goodbye to in August. And it's my fault. I knew something was wrong. He knew it too. I know I let his nurse know but I should have stayed until I knew he was ok for sure. The guilt is going to kill me. I already suffer from ptsd and anxiety. I am constantly either in the verge of crying, hopelessly depressed, having panic attacks or just a blank emotionless husk pretending I'm ok. I'm realizing more and more everyday how much I miss and neglected the relationship I had with my dad, and how he will never be the same man again, even if he recovers he will never be the same.

117,"I'm usually very controlled with my alcohol. I don't drink often and when I do it's usually a glass of beer or a mild cocktail after a reasonably heavy meal. Before yesterday, I have never been drunk or high in my entire life.

Also, I know I get sad (depressed?) sometimes with occassional suicidal ideation. This started after I broke up with my ex last year and flares up on significant dates like on birthdays and holidays. I haven't sought help but it's infrequent enough that it doesn't affect my work and social life.

Yesterday I decided to throw caution to the wind and drank several shots of gin (can't remember how many) on an empty stomach at a party consisting mostly of work colleagues. I don't remember much about what happened when I was drunk but I recall screaming for my colleagues to kill me or let me die. I remember crying and begging them to let me jump out the window. I woke up with scratches and bruises on my body and a bloody toe.

None of my colleagues seem to acknowledge what happened. I don't know if they are pretending nothing happened or if I just imagined the whole thing. A few that I asked said I mumbled a bit and went to sleep, which contradicts my injuries. I don't know what the alcohol did to me. I don't know if this is normal when people get drunk. 

I hope someone can advise me what to do. Should I seek help from a mental health professional? Or would it be enough just to abstain from alcohol from now on?

120,"Although I am not sure, but I assume I have mild OCD of type: Checkers. I basically get intrusive thoughts telling me to check that the lid of my water bottle is closed tight before going to sleep.   
And sometimes, when I unplug a certain power cord, these intrusive thoughts force me to make 100% sure that I unplugged the power cord. Or similar and less intrusive ones. But they're weak enough for me to just block them out (except for the bottle-lid one, as it's a little harder for some reason to block it). It all started a couple years ago for some reason that I am unaware of.

&amp;#x200B;

English is my second language. Now, throughout my day, I always experience weird intrusive thoughts that question the grammar of certain sentences in English. For example: I get a thought asking me: ""Is it: these types of things, or these type of things?"", this is just one example, if I decide to completely block that thought, I will do fine until another thought of the same kind pops up in my head. But if I decide to act upon the thought and inquire the correct grammar, I will get confused and really anxious. I really can't prove these English grammar structures which is why I choose to completely block these thoughts. I really speak English instinctively, I learned it while growing up. I wasn't taught it with grammar structures like adjectives, past, present, adverb and other things.  


Now English isn't the only case. It also occurs when I do Math, intrusive thoughts pop up in my head telling me to prove certain things such as why you can't cancel certain fractions algebraically. And these thoughts are more intrusive than the English ones, they really scratch my head and disrupt my focus from learning new things until I prove why you can't do certain things or why a certain thing works the way it does. Hell, I'm not even a mathematician, but I have to use everything I know to prove why it is the way it is. I believe these thoughts are more intrusive and harder to block because I can prove certain things in Math unlike in English where I can't prove grammar rules (as I don't know how to). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the most part, these thoughts don't occur in day-to-day exchanges of information, such as recalling a friend's name, writing down something, buying groceries, browsing the web and other day-to-day things.  


I believe they occur only within the scope of when I learn a new framework or a body of something.  
Note: these thoughts occur regularly.

2. I have hallucinations, mostly visual but sometimes auditory too. I can see shadow people, sometimes even actual people, that aren’t there. I hear voices mostly just calling my name, or whispering, but i also hear screaming and sometimes they insult me or tell me to do things.
3. I have intrusive thoughts, and sometimes i am compelled to do certain actions, like I have to check to make sure my door is fully shut constantly, have to make sure things are plugged in etc.
4. I’m not interested in things that i used to be.
5. I feel like ordinary stuff has meanings for me. I feel like some things are a sign just for me, proving i need to do things.
6. When i watch movies i take on the personality of the people in the movie, My whole personality changes including the way i walk, talk, etc.
7. I’m always tired but I have insomnia, these are side effects from my meds but i have had them before i took them,
8. I have delusions, I think that there are cameras in my house and there are cameras in the bathrooms things like that
9. I have very frequent mood swings, This could be from my age but the main one is i go from being depressed for a week, and then the next week I Have a lot more energy then usual.
10. I have cognitive problems, like I can’t focus things like that.
11. My appetite changes often, i could go from starving one day, to not being hungry at all the next.
12. I have flashbacks from trauma, and I avoid situations due to anxiety that it will happen again.
13. I go from hating someone one day, to loving them the next, it feels out of my control, and my relationships are often messed up because of it
14. My way of talking is kind of messed up, i stop mid sentence and sometimes switch topics completely
15. I am paranoid, i think someone is out to get me, and i can’t trust my friends because i think they will use information i give them against me in the future 
17. I have really bad social anxiety, sometimes to the point where it’s like a paralyzing fear.
18. I either don’t react to criticism at all, or I over react to it.
19. I am very impulsive, and i can’t help it
20. I get angry very easily, i think the word is like highly irritable.
21. My friends say I unusual beliefs, and i believe in lots of conspiracy theories 
22. I have meltdowns, where I just completely break down and start crying or screaming, or when someone is talking to me, i get overwhelmed very easily and say something like “stop yelling at me”
23.I have a lack of close friends, and i find people intimidating when they aren’t trying to be

No-one understands why the aspect of death is so terrifying for me, and the fact that I have no control over people dying in traumatic accidents. I think people either simply don't care or can't be bothered to try and care. I feel like the phrase ""same shit different day"" is a good way of describing my anxiety  because my dad rides home from work on his bicycle most days and I feel like I can't begin to relax untill he's come in through the door because if I try and relax and he is injured in an accident then I'll have a go at myself because i'll feel like I could have somehow prepared myself by being upset already before the accident , so it wouldn't come as such a shock-In all honesty I think it's a waste of time where therapy is concerned, because it's not like having a fear of public speaking , where you gradually learn through each speech that speaking in public gets easier with every occasion, this is different because I can't predict when something bad will happen and my anxiety won't get better with time because I can't guarantee that every time I worry about an accident that it's not going to happen",19Jan2020,1

so basically i've gotten strep throat 3 times in the past two months . for those of you who don't know strep throat causes high fevers, and can be very serious if left untreated. this morning i noticed that my tonsils are inflamed and full of puss (the tell-tale sign for strep throat) and so i went online to figure out why the hell i get it so damn often. I've been suffering from bouts of bulimia and other eating disorders for the past two years or so, i've found that frequent vomiting can cause the tonsils to be more susceptible to tonsillitis and strep  throat. essentially i have to stop throwing up or else i can cause  very serious damage to myself. this news really sent me into a bad place. ive used eating disorders as a way to keep myself from other forms of self harm (in my case burning myself).  i dont know if i can function properly if i dont have the option to binge and purge. i have a lot of trauma i haven't been able to address properly and need some kind of coping mechanism and i need mental health help; unfortunately the counselling center at my university (the only feasible place where i can receive this help)  is open at hours that conflict with my classes and, even though ive called 13 times in the past week, i haven't been able to get a hold of anyone who could make me an appointment. what can i do?",19Jan2020,1

I like to look back on those good days and relive and see things I did when I was happy.
It's getting to the point where I do it too often and to my important friends, I think of them being their old selves. Which they've changed and became pretty decent and moved on, while I stayed behind, alone with my thoughts.
I can only remember those precious memories and stay afloat while driving myself to madness and ruin.
I seek to change, but I need to fix many things right now and I become too overwhelmed.
So I take a break and look back to give the happiness and motivation to try again, I honestly wanna stay isolated, but I can't. 
I'll probably decay from within and break from my loneliness.

143,"(I just finished and this turned out longer than I expected, thank you if you if you take the time of reading me) 

I’m not sure if this is the right place to talk about this, sorry if it isn’t. The last couple of months I’ve been dealing with a bunch of things that have really taken a toll at my energy. 
I consider myself a lucky person and my friends joke that I’m Domino from deadpool (silly but is a cute reference). Lately I haven’t been feeling as lucky, in the last three months of 2019 I got into a car accident in the highway (construction site badly signed and at night) and literally nothing happened to me, just a stiff neck, my car had considerable damage but the insurance covered everything, this is an example of what I mean to have bad things happen to me but getting the best outcome out of them. In that same period of time my uncle went missing and was found 3 days later (he was the lucky one in this one, he is totally fine) and just last night someone tried to rob my car, that I’ve just gotten back from the shop, luckily(ha) because of this there weren’t any valuables inside, they tried to take the battery but they couldn’t. 
Friends and relatives keep saying that everything is fine, at least nothing worse happened in each case, that I’m safe and I get the sentiment but I’m so done with this stuff happening to me, I still get angry and scared, I’m scared to drive, to go outside too late or alone, I’m even scared to be in my apartment now and I don’t know what to do or why this kind of stuff keep happening to me. Should just accept that I’m like cursed? Or can I do anything to stop this kind of things from happening?  
I think the worst part is that for example I’m sure I got the trauma from my accident but since I didn’t have any physical injuries I had to deal with everything in silence, like I didn’t get the chance to recover mentally along an injury? Like I have to recover myself from all this things in silence and to keep going because I have other obligations and I just wish I could stop time and have a moment to heal myself or to even cry them out of my system and if I say something people keep telling me that it wasn’t a big deal because I’m fine physically but this things just keep eating me alive and I’m scared and far away from home and my parents and maybe all this things aren’t really that big of a deal anyways and I’m just being silly?

148,"I apologise for the long post but in order for you to see why I feel like I need to leave I need to explain how I’ve found myself making one of the hardest choices of my life.  I also apologise for the grammar but it’s been a long emotional day and I really hope this is coherent. 

Today I have admitted something to myself that I’ve been in denial about for fourteen years. I am an addict. 

I’m a 27 year old man who grew up in a town just outside of London. My mother is addicted to prescription pills like Xanax and Valiums and also smokes about an eighth of weed a day and has done for as long as I remember. She’s mentally ill herself and loves me with all of her heart and just wants me to be happy. My father was a depressed alcoholic who spent the last ten years of his life slowly drinking himself to death after a car accident and died when I was 19. 

I grew up on an estate and have been friends with the same people for all of my life. They have always felt like my chosen family even before we started partying. We used to run around the estate causing havoc together, we got in fights with other people and each other, we laughed and we cried together. Went through trauma together. We saw all sorts of people come and go but there was always a core group of us that were as thick as thieves, so much so people to this day still talk about how envious they are about how close we still are after so long. 

We didn’t stay boys forever though and soon drink and drugs came on to the scene. At 14 a few of us had already left school and were in the park drinking and smoking weed like a lot of teenagers do but before long outside influences led us to other avenues of taking the edge off on a Friday and by 16 we were already taking ecstasy and getting into underground raves in London. By 18 we were in the pub every weekend with a pint in hand and a wrap of coke in the our pockets thinking we were living our best lives. 

When my dad died at 19 my childhood dog had died an hour before and I couldn’t understand why life had been so merciless in such a short space of time and so I began to question everything I thought I knew. Was this the point of it all? Do we just live this way and then die? What’s right and what’s wrong? I started reading books by people like Emma Goldman and Noam Chomsky and I came to realise that the world isn’t actually quite right and so began the wanting of something more but what that something was I had no idea which created an emptiness that my friends couldn’t understand. To them all I was feeling was just words. 

The older we got the more we went through. Nothing too special, few heart breaks here and there, good times and bad times just like everyone else but the drinking and drug taking had gotten heavier. I couldn’t see it at the time but I’d become so used to getting out of it to escape reality that I’d actually become addicted to it.  I realise now I didn’t want it but needed it. By 23 I began smoking joints like they were cigarettes, pub on Friday, Rave on Saturday and smoke weed while you’re on a come down all day Sunday kind of thing. I knew it wasn’t normal but we were having fun and weren’t hurting anybody and I dismissed my fears of addiction as just a come down making feel terrible. 
At 25 I’d overdosed on some bad ketamine after being a bit reckless after a recent love interest had ended things and I ended up needing to be resuscitated on site at a festival. I still remember hearing people speak but seeing only black, until I felt a sharp sting on my leg where I came back around like I’d just risen from the dead. I had a cup of tea and went back to my friends before double dropping two ecstasy tablets my friend sold me. 
As my close friends all grew stronger with their partners we saw each other maybe once a week where once it would be more or less everyday. I became distant and spent more time on my own. Getting lost in my own head searching for something I still couldn’t find, making me feel emptier inside but then in June last year I met, who I’m going to call for anonymity purposes, D. 
I’d been in relationships before but never like this. We fell in love hard and quick. She was the sister of a friend so we kind of felt safe with each other as it was like an unofficial insurance policy that kept us both honest. 
The summer was perfect and for the first time in a long time I was hardly doing any drugs at all. I was still smoking a fair bit of weed but I was very keen on kicking it if not for me then for D.  But then D got pregnant.  Our own fault. We weren’t careful. It took us a week to decide what to do and at one point we were going to keep it until eventually we decided we needed to be us a little more first.  We went to the clinic and got the pill, and then I held her for hours as she lay on my bathroom floor bleeding, being sick, shivering and sweating at the same time, helplessly just holding her. Afterwards we both agreed that we made the right choice and we were glad we did it together. 
But then things took a turn. D had to move for work and we saw each other less but we were still making it work. I had doubts but she would constantly reassure me and make me feel like there was nothing to worry about. Talking of weddings and how I’m her world in November and how she needs to be alone December, a week after I moved back in with my mother to get rid of any overheads so I could start a business, a move I definitely wouldn’t have done if I knew I was going to be broken up with due the easy availability of drugs in the house. I was complete crushed. I know relationships end all the time but I couldn’t understand why she reassured me when she was just going to leave. How was I supposed to trust anybody else when she was as convincing as she was? Something I’m sure many of you will have gone through. Naturally I was filled with grief as all of this love in me suddenly had no place to go. My world had never seemed smaller and I spent weeks in bed going out only to drink and sniff coke until 5 in the morning before coming home, taking some Xanax to fight the comedown while I smoked weed and went in and out of conciseness right through to Christmas and my birthday, where I began to hit my bottom and everything began to change. 

I was outside a bar on my birthday with a friend smoking a cigarette when he said that D was walking toward us. I didn’t believe him because I didn’t know she was in town but low and behold there she was.  She looked at me and turned away, walking and pretending that we hadn’t just locked eyes. I could barely breath. I needed a drink and another boot of coke but as I went back inside a bouncer stopped me and searched me, pulling out a joint id left on the inside pocket of my jacket that I’d forgotten about. We argued and he threatened to call the police over one joint and I laughed at him and told him to do it and as I did, British transport police pulled up at the traffic lights outside and the bouncer waved them over, where they proceeded to arrest me for the weed and the wrap of coke I’d forgotten to disclose on account of being a drunken mess. It was my birthday after all which the police were more than kind enough to arrange a stay 25 miles away from where I live only to leave me there for another part of the police to deal with. I broke down in my cell and I cried. Cried for D waking away. I cried for being in a cell on my birthday while I was still rushing off coke. The station nurse came to see me and declared me a severe concern or something of the like. I was later released where the custody sergeant apologised to me as I should have been dealt with on the road there and then and been dealt a caution. Thankfully he offered two officers overtime pay to drive me the 25 miles home as it was 5 in the morning and I didn’t have any money. I got into bed and stayed there right the way through new year and the first few days of January where my dog (the one to replace my childhood dog) had died of advanced liver cancer.

I gave up.  I couldn’t see which way I needed to go anymore so stayed in bed alone but for weed, tramadols and Valium’s. Until Friday where I decided to put up a facebooks status essentially seeking attention and making out like I was going to commit suicide but in reality what I was saying was that an old me has to die for a new me to be reborn but I didn’t correct people who were wrong because I enjoyed the attention. 

My mum would come in a few times a day each time with some more weed and pills because all she wanted to do was see her boy smile and this seemed to be the only way to get close. 
My friends pulled me out of bed yesterday afternoon where we drank and then sniffed coke until 6 in the morning before I walked home, slowly pondering everything that had gone over the last month and then when I got home and started looking back at the last year, then the last five before finally I started looking at my whole life before coming to the conclusion that I was, as Russel Brand puts it,  “a little bit fucked” 

I realised that I actually want to be sad because I want to get high and escape. When D left of course her absence hurt but that wasn’t the real problem. The real problem was I wanted her to save me. To save me from becoming what I was well on the way to becoming, my father. 

Every time I feel like maybe my life is going in the right direction I end up in a place I never even knew could feel this bad, so I turn to escape reality in an environment where drugs and drink are everywhere I turn. I can escape reality but not the means to get away from it. 
When I looked back at my life, I genuinely couldn’t remember the last time I was completely clean.  Alcohol, weed, cocaine, ecstasy, MDMA, DMT, shrooms, Xanax, valiums, tramadols, diazepams, two overdoses, countless blackouts, nights where I’ve lost everything and made mistakes that have sent shockwaves reverberating through out my life. 

I’ve never been suicidal. Not truly. I get very reckless and flirt with things that seem risky and generate a sort of romantic perspective of death because the closer I feel to it the more I feel something, anything to make me feel more alive. 
Over the last two decades or so I’ve been blessed with what some people go there whole lives without having but I have become desperately unhappy in my life right now and feel trapped. I’m terrified a great deal of the time. Terrified of being my dad or worse. It consumes me and starts to affect people around me. At home my mum wants be to be happy but she doesn’t know how to make it happen so she does what she can but it makes it worse. My friends are the same. They don’t understand that the life we live and our attitude towards drink and drugs isn’t normal and that it’s slowly destroying me. 

Which leads me to the point of this whole thing. I want to live a life sober, but I’m not strong enough to avoid the temptations that come hand in hand with the people I love most in this world. I have to either pick my mum and friends who’ve shaped me and been my family or I pick a new life that’s far away from any kind of life I’ve known before. 

So am I the asshole if I leave my friends and family in order to be clean and have a better chance of happiness in life? Or am I just being over the top and do I need to find a way to be clean and be around the people I love despite what comes with that? 


My brother supports me and tells me I need to get out of this place as soon as I can. My mother supports me even though she knows it means she might lose a son.  My friend says to I’m being over the top and I should try CBT something I’ve already tried. 

I’m going to the doctors first thing tomorrow but until then I guess I’m just after a strangers ear. Someone who doesn’t know me to tell me their perspective on it what I’m doing is brave or cowardly. 

If you’ve got down this far thank you so much for reading a little about my life so far, I hope you can help me going forward.",19Jan2020,1

151,"Hi, Im new to making posts, so please bare with me. 
I’m Em, I suffer with trauma induced anxiety and depression. Earlier today I had a panic attack and it was quite bad. I haven’t had one like that in a while. I was in my room when it happened (I live in the loft) and my dog was downstairs in the living room. Apparently he was whining and the door and doing little barks, so my sister knew something was wrong. She opened the door so he could come upstairs and he starts going frantic at my ladders, alerting my sister what was going on. He’s not a loud dog, he rarely ever barks, but he is going absolutely ballistic at this point, I’ve never heard him like that. He tries jumping up my ladders to get to me but can’t because my sister is sat on them, which seems to worry him even more. He then proceeded to get a flannel from the bathroom and bring it downstairs so my mum notices, he’s a very naughty dog so she noticed straight away. Normally he’s a bugger for dropping stuff, but he did as he was told, at that point my mum knew something was going on. She closed him in the living room and came upstairs. A little while later as I’m calming down I ask if he can come up, I wanted to see what he would do. Bronn is a very very energetic dog, he’s a young border collie, so he leaps on my mums bed as usual but he seems frantic. He climbed all over me, circled me, and finally laid down with his head smushed against my leg. 
The point of this post is really to see if anyone knows how he knew? I find it really strange, we were in completely different parts of the house. It really meant a lot to me what he did, I’ve never known him like that (he’s a complete tosser) and it’s something I’ll never forget. Thanks for reading!",19Jan2020,1
