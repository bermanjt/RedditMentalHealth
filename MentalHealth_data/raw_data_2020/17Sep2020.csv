1,"So I originally wrote this as a reply in a watch subreddit. Yes. I am that guy. Reality kicked in (luckily) before I posted it. Thought ""there's got to be a better place"" which brings me here, so I'm just going to post the text I cut and go about my business, just feels good to talk about it having recovered sufficiently to have hindsight. And a (friendly) hug to anyone going through or who has gone through a psychotic episode. That stuff sweeps the fucking world from under your feet and shoves the rug up your arse. Weird really how comfortable and second nature it feels whilst in the grips of it, you manage to make everything make sense, in a way that doesn't make sense. I dogress, here-

""Soooooo..... I wrote a long 'true-story' about why the purple GLS5600 in the second photo, whilst not in my top 3, not my aesthetic at all and functionally pretty boring is the watch I'll take to the grave. Long story short it was purchased for me by my daughter whilst I was in the midway point of a long and severe psychotic episode that led to hospitalisation for months and all sorts of weirdness. Anyway. I thought this was a magical watch (don't trust me I also thought I was Jesus, buddha and the black panther at the same time) I had a lot of beliefs involving colours, eg: (UK) paramedics= green + good (for me), police and nurses = blue + bad (for me). I was choosing my colours within this vast conspiracy and had to hide my 'true colours'; natural colours. Behind you in the car? Orange car good, white car bad etc. Anyway kids were rainbow coloured and weren't good or bad (for me) as they hadn't really commited- socially, religiously, artistically, professionally etc and being given this watch, that was such a strong mix of colours I was not, it was a huge deal and helped calm me down alot. Whilst unwell for a long period after being given it, it was part of an upswing (possible bad terminology in the context) that brought me back to comparitively good health.  Selling it would be bad juju, figuratively and, no, not literally.... That was the short version and if you get through it, thanks! If not, I don't blame you, I probably wouldn't have either.""

That was it, I swiftly changed my mind. I've battled (still battling some) severe depression, PTSD, anti-social behaviour disorder, numerous different drug addictions. The list goes on. Nearly died this Feb (still in my thirties) due to liver failure, pneumonia and other bits all directly as a result of alcoholism, sober since I left hospital in April. Had my foot chopped off in a motorbike accident too. Ikr, lucky me. Anyway. Any kindred spirits I feel for you. I hope I never go back there regarding psychosis or drug use and (TL:DR) i hope you all do well with your own demons, whatever they may be.",17Sep2020,1

4,"I call it a nervous breakdown but it’s probs just a manic depressive episode. My mental health has been at a decline for weeks and I think it has snapped me. Don’t really know what happened it was my first day back at college and it didn’t go well I was a lot more stressed than I thought I was invited to a few drinks with my friends this week and I told her I’d be free tonight only and she said she would let me know what day they would do. Here’s me waiting for a message saying it wasn’t happening and then I get a Snapchat of her and my other friend partying having this amazing time. This has happened twice where I’ve been blatantly left out recently and it’s really starting to hurt me. I get really panicky cause i feel like they don’t like me as much as I like them back. They are my only friends I am alone everyday apart from my off days when I see them and being left out sucks! All my other friends left me or were just using me and then I’m left alone and im panicking that that they are gonna end up the same. I had a panic attack in the shower which was traumatic, I’ve been crying and pacing for hours I’ve never gotten this bad before I was considering S/H but thankfully I’ve calmed down a little. I’m in such a state not even from what happens today but just how it’s been in general. I’ve been in a fog for months and now the world is moving on going back to colkege more hours at work and My mind is still fucked.",17Sep2020,1
6,"i’m gonna try to make this make as much sense as possible. 

i’m a hair student, and yesterday while colouring a clients hair, i got this really intense memory that flashed in my mind for a few seconds, only it wasn’t a memory because it’s something that never happened. but felt real. it may have been a dream i had once before. 

after it passed, i felt like i was going to pass out or throw up so i ran outside. i was trying to remember what was going on in my head, but i couldn’t. I went back inside feeling fine, and continued working on her hair. 3 minutes later, it happens again. i see this fake memory/dream and all of a sudden i feel sick again. i can’t remember the last few minutes of doing her hair, and i can’t remember what the memory was. 

i decided to get a ride home early with my other classmate as i was too scared to drive. after being at home, it happens a few more times, and once as i am falling asleep. that time, i’m gasping for air and having a really hard time breathing. 

my mom asked me what i was seeing, but since i don’t remember i tried my best to explain what happened. she was being supportive, but i can tell she doesn’t believe me. i don’t know what is going on, it hasn’t happened in about 12 hours now. but i’m scared it’s gonna happen again. 

has anyone else experienced this? or is this really all just in my head",17Sep2020,1
7,"Sometimes when someone might give me some criticism I may take it the wrong way or I say something weird and it would stick with me for the rest of the day. Sometimes all night I would just feel like shit. I may stop or barely eat. I would be bawling all night. But it's mostly only a a few hours. When I go to sleep and wake up in the morning I will feel better.

Recently that hasn't been the case. Yesterday I said something to my mom and I thought she thought it was stupid and j felt horrible. I don't know why. I have been trying not to eat and then when I gave up a few hours ago I started feeling horrible ever since.

My mom has no clue. I don't tell her because she says it's ”just hormones” or ”oh I felt like that when I was younger you will get over it” but it doesn't work like that. She once guilt-tripped me into doing something by saying ”it will make your dad feel bad” and then when I confronted her about it she just said ”guilt is just apart of life” and I have felt bad for him since then.

I wanna know if this is normal or not. I have heard of these two terms called ”HSP” or ”Generalized Anxiety Disorder” and I have some of the symptoms but I am too scared to get a therapist. I always feel like I'm just doing it for attention. It seems ridiculous.",17Sep2020,1

10,"So I'm at the stage of my mental health issues where I feel alone constantly and am irritable about everything. I am seeing myself looking terrible in the mirror, I see a hideous, fat, hairy, balding, body acne covered monster. I am having at least 4 suicidal thoughts a day, I have no plans of fulfilling them, so I am safe there. It still sucks to have them. I feel myself pulling away from my friends. I mean not like they are around much anyways. My work schedule is very different and no one wants to compromise so I just spend 90% of my time alone. I get blocked on dating apps as soon as I send a face picture or body picture, I get no matches on the more ""classy"" dating apps, besides bots and fake pics that are 5,000 miles away. Having to wake up and get out of bed is literally the worst thing ever, I am so angry I have to get up. I am so angry I have to go to work to survive. I am so angry I can't just stay in bed or in my house all day doing as I please. I am so angry I am in my house alone. I am so angry that I don't make 70 or more K a year. I am mad I have to pay bills. I am just angry, sad, frustrated, lonely, it's so many negative feelings all the time. I want to change my way of thinking and change my routines and live a healthier life that is more fulfilling and find my confidence and self worth. I want to so bad and it's just like as soon as I try my brain just shuts it all down. I hate to say this but it's just so hard. I know life isn't suppose to be easy. I just wish it was easier. Why can't I have a typical brain and typical hormones and typical balance. That's all I want. I want to see the world and the future like I did when I was 15 years old. It was so bright. So it's all just dark and unreachable. I know that's not true and I know it's my outlook and perspective and I know it is fixable. But why can't I fix it. It just gets partially fixed then breaks again after one go about. I see guys that have rejected having great relationships with guys that are hairy, bald, chubby even bigger than me. So it's not my weight or my hair. It's me. I'm the problem. It hurts. I know that I can fix Me but I don't know why I am not succeeding. I don't know why it can't just stick. I am alone so much I should love myself. I don't. I'm the worst. I am the friend that doesn't want do anything, that makes trips have to be shortened, that makes us have to get cheaper places to stay, I'm the friend that has all issues. I'm THAT person. I never wanted to be THAT person. No wonder my friends don't compromise, they rather not have to deal with me. I wouldn't want to deal with me either. Everything just feels so far away. The fact that I am writing this and it is so all over the place with no consistency, it just has my ADD all over it. That upsets me. I don't want to be that person. I want to be organized and consistent and type A. That's who I am on the inside but then I have all these other things fighting it so I am constantly having internal conflicts with my actions. I know what I want and what I need but I am doing the complete opposite constantly. Living totally on impulse and pleasure indulging. I hate it. I just want total self control over my thoughts, actions and words. Yet the more I try to more out of control it all becomes.  I'm over typing so I'm done, rant over.

13,"So of the night I’m making this post, a girl who goes to my church had what I can only describe as an anxiety attack, and my dad, who is the pastor, seems to be disregarding that her issues may be serious. 

So, for some background, I’m 14, and my friend is 16, and we both go to a small church (10-15 people) every Sunday, and tonight a group of about seven younger kids came to our youth group, when we only normally have about 5-7 kids all around are ages. So tonight after the study wrapped up and we went outside, the kids started being loud and very annoying, which made my friend start breathing really heavy, and kids wouldn’t stop bothering her.

For some background, this girl doesn’t have a good home life; her mother is verbally abusive and she has terrible anxiety because of it.

So later after that she nearly passed out and I had to help her back to the building. Meanwhile kids were running everywhere and my dad and step-mom were standing and talking instead of controlling the children, which made me kind of angry beyond kids pushing and shoving me. When we dropped her back off at her house I had told her that she doesn’t have to come if she doesn’t want to, but she said she would continue just to get away from home. After that my dad said that she should be old enough just to let it slide off of her, and that she is just being dramatic and seeking attention, which I agree with to an extent, but when she’s shaking and clearly having a breakdown I’m not quite sure if she’s seeking attention.

It just makes me feel terrible, and subsequently gives me anxiety, when she has to walk back into a house where she gets verbally abused, and nothing gets done about it. I really feel helpless for the situation because my stepmom tries to talk to her about it every Sunday, but just says she needs to ignore it, and it just isn’t that simple. To clarify my dad and stepmom are very nice and caring people, but they just don’t seem to have a good grasp of what she’s going through.

Honestly I just need some advice. I feel like I should talk to someone like my dad and tell him that I’m concerned that she might harm herself as she has said that she’s at that point (though I never ever see marks or bruises on her skin, to clarify). My brother and her brother are very good friends, and he knows very well what his sister goes through (though he is much older than she is) and I’m not sure if I should express my concern to them. The only person I feel comfortable relaying the information to is my mom, who I see quite often, so I think that may be where I go first, to at least make the problem clear. I’m also going to try to talk to my dad about keeping Wednesday nights under control from now on.

Overall it just makes me feel terrible, and, being religious, I think it helps to pray as well. Sorry for this post here being so long, I just feel like I need to get this off of my chest (for anyone who worries about my mental health, I promise you that I’m doing well). I think I just need my dad and stepmom to understand that when someone says concerning things, they should be taken into consideration, because neglecting these things just doesn’t end well, and I don’t want to stay quiet about it anymore.",17Sep2020,1

15,"Hey,
So ive been super stressed out and between depressed/self-loathing episodes lately. This situation is me still being stressed out alittle and im unwinding. 
My boyfriend and i were having a loudish volume conversation venting about how we need to do chores but we cant really do them because the tools are being used by other housemates (like cleaning up after dinner-the sink is occupied by other dishes that werent ours, the need to do laundry but washer is being occupied by other housemates, etc)
I was venting alittle, saying along the lines ""im getting alittle impatient. We have needs and a bunch of laundry to take care of, and we need to wash communal things. I might just go to a laundromat or something"".   I dont think i verbally said something necessarily rude, but i was alittle frustrated and it probably came out in my tone and my volume.  I thought me and my boy were alone, but i was woefully mistaken. My bf told me the other housemate was home, and in the other room but possibly didnt hear. I think the housemate in question heard, but hes being cool about it and nice.. choosing not to confront me on it.

After i found that out, i immediately felt bad and wanted the ground to swallow me up. I am the type of person to try my hardest to keep negative people situations away, i dont lie to gossip or vent (but i cant help but vent sometimes :(   ),. I dont like having drama or negative vibes with everyone, but ive been sensing a small tension growing... 

I really dont know what to do, do i apologize for being loud and frustrated and kinda jerky? Or would i make it weird?

24,"I know... you're probably thinking ""He's a predator?  Let him go!""   It's not so simple.  This story is kinda long and complicated.  

So this person and I were friends for 10 years and last month he turned completely psychotic.  I told him to stop insulting me in front of girls.   For background I was abused by my father and am a shy guy.   So after I told him he began to harass me the whole day twisting everything saying it was my fault for being cuddly or shy.   And so I blocked him after some real nasty shit talking, thinking it would end.    Nope.   He goes on to stalk me by calling me on private numbers and even driving to my house and threatening my family that if I don't come out things will get worse.   The cops were called and he is now forced to stay away from me. 

But here's where it gets complicated.  He never used to be like this.   He was actually a pretty fun guy to be with.   Energetic and outgoing and friendly.  We went to a lot of places together, played a lot of games together.   We had a ton of great memories.  And it just saddens me that he threw all that away over something that could've been easily fixed.  It could've been so simple. 

But then I realized a lot more was under that persona.  I learned he has a history of violence with knives, a history of reckless driving, and a history of making unwanted advances on women.  And ever since his father died, he's been taking his rage out on everyone that even talks to him.  And I even learned some of the girls he had over who took an interest in me were advanced on even more harshly, and possibly assaulted too.  I can't guarantee the assaults but from the circumstances that followed after their falling ours, I honestly wouldn't be surprised.

And now I'm not only grieving the loss of the friendship, but I'm also incredibly worried about anyone else he may try to victimize.  As a survivor of abuse myself I'm passionate about helping people out of potentially dangerous or even deadly situations.   But I know I can't do anything because since the cops have an eye on him, and judging from his actions, my own life could be in danger if I spoke up.   It kills me though because I don't want anyone to go through something horrible.

And now she wants to move out, divorce my dad, and get an apartment with her friend

I tried to talk to her today about going to a counselor or a psychiatrist to talk out her issues as I can see a lot is bottled up. She got into her headspace of “your against me all the time” “your only doing this cause you don’t like me”, etc. She gave me a very abusive child hood mentally, physically and emotionally.

31,"Hello everyone, so this pandemic apparently messed me up , i tought i had left self harm behind , i hadn´t done it for 3 years , now this conduct is back , i can barely keep myself from doing it, i just did it , not to severe , little bit of blood,earlier, i had this chat with a friend with benefits you could say, i could not find words to tell her that i would be more comfortable if started just being friends again and i used poor wording , like i f i was breaking up with her ,she told me it was fine ,, but i can´t help to think she took it badly,  so i turned a knife on myself for it, it seems i always commit errors , there is always a flaw , and i sometimes feel like i´m not enough, im simply too idk weird? , i kinda feel i like i hate myself sometimes and i start feeling anxious and this toughts start flowing , things like"" she should leave her"", ""you dont deserve nothing good"" and so on , and maybe thats true , thanks for reading",17Sep2020,1
32,"Hello. 

I wanted to write a huge post, but I am shaking and sweating, and can barely think... because she brings this topic up every now and then, and it TRIGGERS ME. Like it did just now.

Me and my gf are together since 2018. We are in a long distance relationship, and we met eachother on the internet. Before we met in real life and decided to be in a relationship, we had almost a whole year to JUST TALK. During this period of time, I mentioned that I have agoraphobia (with many others), panic disorder, ocd.. I also told her that I can NOT travel.

I was diagnosed when I was 7 years old. It's most likely genetics, because my grandama has panic disorder, my mom had panic disorder too with ocd.
But I also had streptococus, if that matters. Many doctors and psychiatrists seen me, I tried different meds too, no improvement. however, over time, some phobias got better, some worsened.

I told my gf everything about it back then. 

During the talking session, she once asked me if I believe in ldr or not. I told her that I do, if there is trust. However, thanks to my mental state, I could not travel, so my partner should come to my place everytime. 

After we met irl for the first time, she asked ""what are we?"". I told her I loved her and I would like to be with her. She said the same thingies. I, again, told her about the fact that I can not travel. She seemed to understand it. We got in a long distance relationship. 

It seemed like she is fine with it, but after a time, she started to bring up the topic about me visitimg her. This usually triggered my panic attacks, and the topic always lead to a fight. Under fight I mean that I am only defending myself.. I am not attacking, because I love her. However, the fight lasts 2 days most of the times.

Lately, these fights got more frequent.. she brings the topic up at random times. It's at a point, that everyday I am in a fear that she will bring it up causing me a panic attack. I am afraid to have a good mood because if she brings it up, I will feel worse. And hell, I do feel bad.
But I am too scared to tell her, because she would think that she is an asshole. But its killing me inside. 

Last time she told me I just use my mental illnesses as an excuse, and that I'm just lazy to take actions.. but how do I tell her, that I am not taking the stairs over the lift to the 10th floor because I am ""lazy"" and its ""comfy"" for me?
How should I explain that I am not avoiding the toilet in the Mall because I am lazy and its comfy for me, but because its in the end of a long and closed hallway, which I am not comfortable with?

I am so ashamed. I love her inside and out. She is like a woman clone of me (but without my mental illnesses). I dont want to lose her. 
I dont know what to do.

I am sorry if I seem confused, but I was triggered by thid topic.. I also apologize for my venting, but I dont know who could understand me.",17Sep2020,1

39,"# What is Positive Psychology?

It's intimidating going into a therapist's office knowing they will be judging you and taking notes on what makes you ""sick."" My therapist has helped me get through a lot, but getting comfortable with the idea of ""having a disorder"" stressed me out for a long time. 

That's why I'm sharing [this](https://groundingpositivity.com/2020/09/12/what-is-positive-psychology-and-why-is-it-important/) article about positive psychology. It makes the most important parts of positive psychology easy to understand. Before reading this article I kinda knew what it was, but not past ""the power of positive thinking and placebo effect."" 

This helped me to understand how positive psychology is actually this awesome new direction in psychology that is TOTALLY different from ""normal"" psychology.

The gist of it is that positive psychology doesn't want to ""cure you."" The goal is to understand these three questions 

1. Do we have control over our happiness?

2. What is happiness?

3. How can we optimize human success?

# PP Exercises

1. This is a technique for being a better listener called Active Constructive Listening (she calls it the Response Keychain)

When our partner comes to us with good news, it turns out that getting excited for her and responding with enthusiasm is only the SECOND best way to respond. The FIRST BEST way to respond is by bringing her back to that exciting moment.

For example, if your boyfriend tells you he wrecked a top-ranked player on Call of Duty, your goal should be make him feel as close to the initial feeling of triumph as possible. I might say: “What map was it on? What guns were you guys using? You should make a Twitch account and get a milli subscribers!”

2.  This is a technique for increasing Gratitude! 

It's a deceptively simple practice. The Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology says that it leads to six months of increased happiness for both parties, on average.

*You just write a one-page thank you note to somebody who wouldn’t expect it and then read it out loud to them.*

This practice is reported to disconnect us from toxic, negative emotions. [The study](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2018-09279-001) found that gratitude keychains also brings both parties an increase in measurable Spirituality.

41,"Hello to all ze internet strangers reading this. It is I, u/sleepdprivedcryptid, a random cryptid who may or may not be real, here to vent and ask some questions. 

I'll start this off by I've never been diagnosed by anyone, just yanked out of class by a counsellor who poked and prodded at my psyche, told my parents, and made my life worse. 

Anywho, I'll start with the depressive mood. I won't refer to it as depression or anything cuz I might not even have it. It might just be me overreacting, and I've come to believe its just that. 

I started feeling depressed around 10 months ago. It's been a time. It started just as lack of motivation and not really caring about anything. Apathy, so to speak. There was no event to trigger this. For the longest time I just left it be. 

Then I got sad. Felt low and just wanted to stay in bed all the time. I was always tired, apathetic, didn't give a single damn about things I use to like. I quit my volleyball. I just... I can't really remember it. It all kinda blurs together. 

Then I felt okay for a bit. My mood improved, I felt happier, more energetic, productive and thought, oh, I'm okay now. And it was like that for a while. 

And then it happened again. Low. Sad. But this time it was worse. I got suicidal. I wanted to die, I wanted to cut, I hated everything. Again, I can't really remember it, so I don't know what to tell you. I can't remember. I just hated it. I wanted to die. 

I felt good then, for a bit. 

Then it got bad again. 

And way, way worse. 

I attempted suicide 3 times. I started cutting. 

It got okay again. And that time was even worse than the sad. I started doubting myself, doubting my reality. Did that even happen? Was I just faking it? 

And then I started feeling like I wasn't thin enough. 

Yup, ladies and gentlemen and my non binary pals and whatever you identify as (you could be an attack helicopter, for all I care), I started starving myself. 

And I still am. 

I still cut. 

I still wanna die. 

But anyways, started starving myself, not eating, lying about meals, the weight had to go down, it had to otherwise it wasn't enough. 

Oh, and I started fading out, for lack of a better term. One second I'm there, but then I'm not. Like I'm out of my body. Like I'm not there. Those aren't my hands. I'm not me. 

I'm in the fog. 

I started making crazy assumptions. The walls are trying to communicate with me. A monster is following me and won't leave me alone. That's not me in the mirror. I'm not real, this is not real. I'm a test subject. And I believed them. Fully, truly, no matter what proved otherwise. 

Started getting random homicidal thoughts. Burn the house down. Do it. Kill her. Do it. Wrap your hands around her neck. Stab her with a pin. Do it do it do it do it. 

Started feeling like my thoughts weren't mine. Like someone else was controlling my brain. Sometimes, I felt like I was hearing things. Voices. Whispers. Once or twice I swear I heard it. 

But right now, I'm okay. I feel fine. Not bad, not happy. Fine. I'll have my good moments. 

And maybe I was just faking it this whole time. 

Maybe I just want attention. 

Maybe I'm lying to myself about being sad.

And no, I can't see a therapist. I can't talk to anyone. My parents don't believe in mental health and the time they found out I was suicidal they laughed it off. They thought the counsellor was crazy. And I had to laugh with them. They were never emotionally there for me anyways. To describe my relationship with my parents would be, they love me but they don't like me. They hate me sometimes and I'm always burdening them but they say they love me and it makes my head spin because two seconds earlier you were screaming about how you wish I was never born. 

Anyways, that's all. 

Thank you for coming this far, if you're still reading. I'm signing off now.

42,"Ok I feel we have to accept all walks of life in the beliefs of eastern and western world.  This goes medicine, government, philosophy and the like.  

A total blanket statement if you will.  Total subjectivness.  If we don’t we are shutting out of our own growth as human beings.  I am not saying fully envelope both sides.  

I am saying meet in the middle and grow from both support systems and also always growing and asking questions amongst each other. 

Not challenging mind you. Keeping in mind each other’s feelings, not emotions.  Remember there is a difference here. 

You cannot die from emotional experiences.  However you can die from feelings. Let me explain...

When you are are angry or upset that’s an emotion.  You can feel in the pit of your stomach.  So where do most children put their arm? Around their stomach/waist.

Now if you are freezing to death, where are your arms?  Up around your shoulders, covering your arms and what else...?  Your ❤️.  You can die from that.  That’s a feeling not an emotion.

Now think about that the next time some one asks you a simple question? Or how you ask a question a specific way to someone.  Hear me out again....

You are at home and your partner walks in and asks how your day was.  Thats asking how you are feeling. 

What if they walk in the room and ask what are you doing home so early?  Sounds pretty confrontational doesn’t it?  See my point?

We need to stop this type of thinking in society and putting labels on everything.  We have been doing it since the dawn of time and making excuses for our own behavior and close mindedness.  If not now, when?  

How is this no different than when a police officer pulls a black man over in a neighborhood he is lost in. This is the definition of white privileged too.  Again if not now when.

Religion.   They tell us how to live our live and give them money to get to the promise land.  I feel Jesus was saying this same message and the Romans crucified him for it because it challenged their whole system of government and thinking.

This is why we need to look at the teachings from the east and the west.  They are all loosely connected.  If you agree or disagree please comment and or share.   I feel this is something worth mentioning....

I feel  the meaning of life is to to fully heal the human mind and remove guilt/resentment.  So the ingredients we need is love and equality along with eastern and western medicine.",17Sep2020,1
43,"Hey I am posting this for my dad since he is old enough he doesn't really understand how people struggle and doesn't like to talk about himself to anyone other than my mom.

He is only 47 and in the last month something happened with his health and hes rapidly spiraling with no diagnosis yet. He is getting 4 mris next week but right how hes extremely freaked out and worried. He can no longer walk more than a short distance on his own and couldn't even button his shirt this morning. The things the doctor is ruling out are all the longer life expectancy things and hes getting increasingly scared hes only going to have a few years in which he will be completely unable to care for himself. Hes a teacher and is working on being able to teach from home but he is losing the ability to enunciate words. Teaching is his life and I am scared that losing the ability to teach will completely ruin him. 

We are still kind of joking about it at home but the undertones have gotten dark. How can I help him be ok even if life expectancy is short. Hes a christian and I am not so I have zero fear of death or too much worry about his own but he is pretty scared both of death and of missing milestones for me(25) and my sisters(18,23). 

Would it be helpful to try to show him we can be ready for the worst (care, death, etc) or will that just hurt him more? 

I have no idea how to help him and my mom and its starting to wear on my own thin mental state.

TW: contamination OCD


I just found out I’m pregnant three days ago. Me and fiancé plan on keeping it and we love each other very much. But- it couldn’t be worse timing. Before I found out I was seeking out mental health treatment facilities because my OCD has been debilitating. Right now I have contamination OCD. I was already so scared about contamination because I live in a not that great early 1970s apartment that has old lead and maybe even asbestos. The place has same little dings in the drywall and a tiny crack in the popcorn ceiling and I can’t help but think I’ve already set myself up for lung cancer in the future. But now that I’m pregnant I’m completely obsessed that my poor baby is going to have a birth defect or developmental issue because of this apartment. I’m so sad because I feel as if I ruined his/her life already. I’m so sad because I should be so happy because I’ve always wanted a big family but it’s hard to be happy my OCD is telling me I’m a terrible mother already. I talk to a therapist though telemedicine and she has been trying to reassure me that I’m overreacting but it’s still hard. I will talk to a normal doctor Monday and ask them about these things but I’m sure even if they tell me everything is fine the OCD will just jump to something else.",17Sep2020,1
48,"So, I've got a big problem. It's a problem I've had since childhood and it's that I subconsciously and sometimes consciously hate my damn self. My mom said that even as a child I hated my self and was a big ""people-pleaser"". As the years have gone on and I've made nothing but mistakes out of my life, it's just not getting better. And I'm trying incredibly hard to rewire my own brain. I've been dealing with the mental health world since I was 13 and my mom found out about the self-harm. Now I am 27 with no degree, no husband, no kids, no accomplishments other than completing a few psychiatric holds. Every day I wonder if there will ever come a day when I don't feel this way. It's been so dark and so sad in my world for SO long and the idea of doing all of this ""mental health work"" for another 14 years is so daunting. I get angry and jealous of people who go their whole lives without ever having to deal with this. I don't know why I'm this way. Or why it has to interfere with even the most basic aspects of my life. All I know is at this point in time after all of the work I've put into trying to change my thinking, I NEED to know that one day it will all be worth it. Its like I literally want someone to look into their crystal ball at my future and tell me for a fact that it will all be okay. I know, it's ridiculous but it's what keeps me awake at night.

ive gotten so much mentally worse over the past few days im so stressed and derailed and feeling like dissociation is coming along i couldnt tell who i was or who i am i need help so badly

ive been avoiding taking antidepressants by pretending to and i dont know if im worse with or without them. all they did was make me gain 20 pounds and since off them i lost 20 pounds, i broke down yesterday for the first time in months. i cant tell anyone. i cant go anywhere. ive lied to my family that the antidepressants work, how will they react if they found out im 1. avoiding them and 2. they didnt work they would. i dont even know.

im so fucking lost im so fucking dead. my heart is bad from how frequently i have panicked. people ask me if im ok and i say im fine i cant vent to anyone anymore. i dont know where i can go.

i have online school now, i regret it partially because im extremely lonely. i only have a singular friend in high school and i worry theyre going to distance from me being gone. then i wont have any irl friends. i cannot vent to my partner. i do not want them worried and this is the first time theyre going to see me breaking down and i cant afford putting all my problems onto them.

54,"Let me (21 FtM) preface this by saying that I don't blame him (20 M) for not telling me, as his biggest problems have come from his parents not recognizing his negative emotions as being valid, so he has trouble talking about them, as well as the fact that anxiety is a hard thing to recognize that you have sometimes.

He used to tell me that he didn't have anxiety when we were both in school together and both of us dropped out. Me, for mental health decline and cognitive issues. Him, because he was losing interest, and his depression was worsening. 

Today I'm wearing the dunce cap a bit, but I'm not blaming myself. We went to Walmart and it's the happiest I've been in a long time because I myself am away from my abusive family for the first time since quarantine started and this was pretty much the first time we spent more than a few minutes out in public.

This is the point at which you should know I'm an ESTP. I was dancing around the store when nobody could see but him. I was pressing buttons on toys that lit up and made noise. I was talking to him (INFP/INTP I think?) about things loudly without a care in the world. He told me I was making him anxious (I have INSISTED that he do this because I knew it may be an issue. He was not being an ass.) I cooled down and pulled out my attitude of composure and I think it made him feel guilty. Again I do not see this as him suppressing me but I think he does, and I must have been really making him anxious for him to say something, because he doesn't like telling people they're making him uncomfortable. I really really understand this, because when my anxiety was not worse but manifesting itself differently when I was younger, I felt the same about people who acted exactly like I act now. 

When we got to the car he was agitated. He said it wasnt about me but I'm not sure. I asked him point blank what was wrong and he couldn't tell me. He didn't know what was upsetting him. When we got home he was worse and after I got out of the car(he had to park it in a very tight garage) I saw him headbanging in frustration. I did my best to calm him. I gave him a hug and asked if I was helping. I did my best but he still seems so agitated. I asked him to type out what he was feeling and what he noticed on his phone. He said it didn't help.

He feels like he cannot talk to anyone about his needs or desires. From the way he describes it, he is the person who holds his family together and he feels like he is expected to do so even though they have not really directly told him that. One of his parents told him that when he left for college having a smaller immediate family was nice, but that the wrong person was leaving and that he held things together. I'm sure it was meant to just be a compliment but he really seems to think about it a lot. He takes care of as many of the family's problems as he can and feels so trapped in that place as the family caregiver.

He feels so uncomfortable talking about what he wants because of the way his family has reacted to it. For example, he likes a certain set of collectables/toys and had immense trouble talking to me about his wanting them, when his birthday is a few weeks away, and he will not ask for ANYTHING. He is so terrified of his parents laughing or telling him it's stupid that he doesnt want them to know he's getting it. He seems to have an immense fear of being invalidated by his parents and I'm not sure how to help, especially because from what I've seen of them, they're wonderful supportive parents who want the best for their kids. Again, the way I see them could be skewed because of my own history of having awful parents. I don't have anything good to compare his to.

I have no idea what he wants ever because he's never had much and never wanted much so I ask about a lot of different things. I also have my own issues to recognize here as Ive always received gifts I didn't like and felt like I couldnt get rid of them. I wanna make sure he gets things he likes. We went through amazon and it stressed him out. He said it was because he would rather just people pick things out for him. I know this is a problem because people don't get him anything if he doesnt tell them what he wants. He asked for one thing for christmas last year and when the technology wasn't compatible with his laptop, it got returned and I don't think he really got anything else.

After typing about all the things he was feeling, he told me about the collectable he wanted. Well, he told me he wanted something but he feared the reaction so much that he couldnt tell me what it was. I made sure to tell him it was a big step he was taking in telling me and that if he felt comfortable we could pull it up online and look at it. By this point he was crying a little and shaking. He had trouble typing it in on the keyboard. After he pulled it up, he put my laptop behind him where I couldn't see it and asked me not to look at it until he left. We talked a bit more about how he needs to find a good therapist and I took him through some breathing exercises. 

I wanna be there for him every step of the way and do everything I possibly can for him because he's the love of my life and has done the exact same for me when things got bad.

He asked me to talk to his parents about his mental health as he felt it was extremely difficult to bring it up to them other than in passing. I gave his mom a lot of information and told her that I think he needs a lot of help asap. She seemed to listen to me and immediately bought some of my recommendation for an over the counter anxiety med.

He's supposed to be sleeping right now but is staying in the room above me and is walking around a lot for someone who is sleeping. I worry the stress and anxiety he expierices attempting to uphold the facade of a perfect son is breaking him. I can tell it's getting harder and harder for him to hide his emotions. 

I told him that we are gonna try to find him a therapist tomorrow. We are gonna look at some and their reviews and try to get him a good one off the bat, which I understand is taxing, but if I'm there to help, I've got much more energy to do important helpful thing for him than I do for myself. 

Any advice on anything else I can do? I'm worried for him. I'm only staying another week and then we likely wont see each other for a very long time, as he plans to move out of the country on his own. I worry a lot about him being on his own too. I had to badger him as much as I was willing to do to get him to brush his teeth and take a shower more than once a week. I'm scared he wont take care of himself and that things will get worse.",17Sep2020,1
56,"My back story. My last year of senior high school I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. I took an SSRI. Things did not get better. I got what seems to be a manic state. I was considering suicide and was hospitalized. I was diagnosed as bipolar and prescribed lithium and abilify. I got out of the hospital and refused to ever seek help for my mental health again. I was afraid of being hospitalized again. I have now gone almost a decade without seeking help. 

Will I need to be rediagnosed? What would a doctor want to do? 

Also, my current doctor does not have my info on my mental health prior. My former records appear to have been lost.",17Sep2020,1
57,"I'm 23F. For kind of a while I've thought I may have some kind of mental health issue or disorder or something, but I've never been sure enough to try and seek out help for anything. The big reasons I think there's something wrong is I have a lot of symptoms that align with OCD and concentration problems. I do have a family history of mental illness/disorders, my mom had bipolar and I believe her mother had schizophrenia. 

For OCD, I have some I guess compulsions like checking that a door is locked multiple times every night and morning even if I never opened it because I'm afraid of my cats getting out or saying something specific every night before I go to sleep as a way to stop something bad happening. Some intrusive thoughts too that bother me sometimes.  

For concentration problems, I just have a lot of trouble concentrating at work and in class or even when watching tv and movies. Like at work if I'm doing something on the computer I usually do like 30 minutes of work and then get on my phone for a while, then repeat that all day. If I'm doing something hands-on or doing multiple things at once or talking to someone while working I usually don't have problems. I also lately have had a very hard time starting things, even fun things like reading a book I'm excited about or a new hobby project. Most days I just sleep in and then sit on my phone and consider it a win if I manage to just watch a tv show or play a bit of a video game. I feel like I don't have ADHD or anything like that because I don't think I had problems like this when I was younger, but I also have a terrible memory and don't really remember what I felt like during high school, let alone earlier than that. I feel like it could be a depression thing, though I don't really feel depressed, but I have some other things that may be because of depression, like over sleeping and a very low tolerance for frustration. 

The reason I've never gone to a doctor is that I just never feel like any of this is truly debilitating. I feel like it's gotten worse during the quarantine, because I have had so many problems actually doing anything, but most of the time I just feel fine I guess. Sometimes I think maybe I feel like it isn't that bad because it's my normal and I don't actually know what real normal is. But I am still worried that I'll go to a doctor and they'll say I don't actually have anything wrong or something. When I see other people talk about their experiences with OCD or depression I don't feel the same way, like it's not at the same level for me. So I wanted to see what other people think. With all of this, does it seem like enough to warrant going to see a psychiatrist?",17Sep2020,1

I'm not looking for outside validation. (Or maybe I am, fuckit, who knows, who cares.)

I definitely am looking for acknowledgment. Maybe connection, if I'm so lucky.

A lot of my comments are ignored. I put a lot of thought and heart into my comments, and I notice that a lot of people posting for input don't actually respond to the people who respond to their post...

I understand that, though. It's not necessarily cool for them to do that but still, I get it. They're in the middle of traversing their own mountain.  And I feel for all the other people that put their hearts into comments and get ignored - I'm sorry, you all! That sucks, I'm sorry.

But here's where I'm messed up... I've put myself out there with a few posts that are basically ignored. I'd like to say it doesn't hurt but, it does... Why do the people who need help but don't respond get all the attention, but people like me who are actually here for the input are ignored?  I don't care if you wanna tell me I'm wrong, I'm open to the input... The only thing I don't want is silence.

I feel like my shit sense of self worth is proving itself right. Or else I'm just manifesting what's in me already.... Either way, I'd like for someone to call me out on it at minimum.

80,"i've been struggling with sleep problems for years. i'm constantly either tired or just partially out of tune with reality, and my sleep schedule is practically nonexistent. 

when i was still in school, it didn't matter how much i'd slept the night before -- i still found myself falling asleep whether with my head on my desk or while sitting up (even in the classes i loved). i'd occasionally fall asleep on the bus home, as well. and regardless of whether i'd fallen asleep in class, i'd usually end up falling asleep when i got home.

if i somehow manage to fall asleep at a decent time, i'll still end up sleeping for 12 hours or more. recently i had a solid three days where i slept for around 18 hours. but on the other hand, there are times that i go to bed at a regular time and i'm absolutely exhausted but i cannot sleep for my life. i've laid there before for 2+ hours, rarely moving, and giving up after finally checking the time. 

along with all this, i have waves of really bad nightmares, and i recently had one that's damaged my ability to sleep at night even further, leaving me constantly afraid to be downstairs alone late at night.

i've tried taking melatonin, i've tried fixing my sleep schedule (because sometimes my regular nighttime sleep will align itself DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY), and i don't know what to do.

i'm diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and ADHD, if that matters. i have derealisation/depersonalisation as well. i'm not on any medication. my mom is diagnosed with hashimoto's hypothyroidism. is there a specific disorder or something that could be causing this bullcrap? my mom's just as bad with her sleep schedule, but i'm getting really tired of being told i'm not trying hard enough to fix my sleep.",17Sep2020,1

He’s pretty much treated me terrible my entire life and I’m sure that he does not care at all. He only occasionally pretends to care so he can stay in a relationship with my mother who has already tried to divorce him. I genuinely think that my father only sees me as something to help him and give him power and since I refuse to do so, I get the worst treatment out of my other 2 siblings. My mom just enables it and when I try to tell her I don’t like my dad, or that I hate when my mom purposely annoys me, she always plays victim.

87," 

Hello, I am a freshman in college and I am getting to the point where online school is starting to bother me a lot. I always viewed that I would be able to learn more about myself and have new experiences around this time because I will be in college living away from my parents for the first time. Well all my classes ended up being online this year so it was a waste of 8000$ to spend on a dorm so i decided I should stay home.

This is starting to affect me mentally now because every once in a while I would be thinking about all the things I could be doing when I am in college and how free I would be. But now I feel like these experiences were robbed from me as if I lost the choice I had. I feel trapped in my house. I can not get my licence because covid closed the dmv licence test and my parents were stubborn AF these last 2 years.(they legit would not let me take the test in the dmv because they did not want to pay for insurance)

. Thinking about what I am missing out is tearing me apart in the inside time to time. I feel like I will never get the college experience I always thought I would and I will be stuck with my parents forever(I know this isn't true or I hope its not true but thats how I feel) .

Also when I do homework i don't enjoy doing I sometimes feel like I am getting tortured because unlike school I don't really have people I can go and talk to after I finish work to lighten my mood, I have to wait a till the evening until my friends come outside to feel a bit refreshed but until then I feel stuck at home with homework I hate doing.

I can't just ignore these feeling because that is just a temporary solution. What is a permanent way I can deal with the way I am feeling. I cant find the answer to this question my self because for the first time I have no control over my own problems.",17Sep2020,1

97,"So I just stumbled on the term “hyperfixating” &amp; Ive been trying to understand if maybe this is the word Ive been looking for? Ive been dealing with very intense obsessive thoughts on things such as movies as a whole or characters from them since I was a young kid. I mean, absolutely overboard on constantly thinking about a movie &amp; the time period &amp; I come up with a million questions that I take to Google for. Its usually absolutely useless knowledge, but I will constantly think about it for months. I usually lose sleep because my thoughts keep me up all night thinking about it. 

I’m curious if maybe Ive been saying obsessive, when in reality the word Ive been looking for is hyperfixating? If you hyperfixate, Im curious on what your experience &amp; take on it is. 

Ive been trying to convey to my dr &amp; family that I absolutely obsess over odd things for so long &amp; its all I can think about. All I hear is “it’s probably OCD” &amp; nothing gets done about it. “Oh just see a therapist &amp; they’ll teach you to stop naturally”—though therapists in my area are not taking new patients. Part of me thinks maybe the word “obsessive” just automatically makes my dr think OCD. Personally, I don’t think it is since its just a constant stream of obsessive thoughts. I don’t think anything negative like “oh if I don’t watch my movie tonight my grandmas going to pass away”. I also don’t have repetitive habits of checking the oven or anything. I just get into this mode where I need to know absolutely everything about a movie for no reason. I cant just enjoy a movie, I have to submerse myself into it for a long freaking time.  

I could very well be wrong on this term, &amp; my doctor could be absolutely right. I just don’t know that he’s fully understanding or taking it seriously. I’m just desperately trying to find the right words that I hope will soon lead to a correct diagnosis. The OCD one just isnt sitting right with me for many reasons. I’m really struggling with my obsessive thoughts &amp; I just want some sort of relief. I barely eat &amp; barely sleep because I get so caught up in my obsessions. I just want to make sure Im conveying my experience well enough to be able to get the proper diagnosis &amp; treatment in the end.",17Sep2020,1
98,"It's 4 am and I have work in the morning but I'm so very happy right now. I was in a really shitty place for a couple of years to the point of me not being able to take care of myself. I always thought I'd be stuck in that kinda of place forever. 

But I got a cat today. And it seems so simple but the work and effort it's taken to get her has been long and hard and sometimes it didn't seem worth it. But she's here cuddling on my bed, I have a living breathing cat I am now responsible for. And it doesn't feel like an enormous pressure to take care of her and get the things she needs. It was fun and exciting to  go to the store and get her supplies and then eventually get her. I'm looking forward to the years i'm going to have with her, and that's something that used to terrify me.

But I got a cat today. I'm lying in bed stroking her fur, and listening as her purrs mix with the cries of the cicadas outside and just soaking in the peacefulness of this hot, sticky summer night. I'm glad I stuck it out for as long as I did.

i know what people say, but words don't change anything snd i feel like i've just taken the big step down. i have anxiety and depression, which is common, but that doesn't make it good. i feel like i'm not ever going to get better. i know i should talk to a therpist, but im scared to tell my parents anything. i have good parents, bad mental health actually runs in our family. i'm not saying that's a good thing, i'm just trying to prove my parents would probably understand. but i still worry about things and overthink everything... and my depression is telling me i deserve this suffering and i shouldn't get help and i know that's not true but i can't help but think that way... but here's where the big step towards something even more awful than what i'm going through happens

100,"Fucking coronavirus! Before all this bullshit started my life was actually decent. I was working a good job, making good money, I had savings for the first time in my life (I’m 29), my credit was rebuilt after basically destroying it in my late teens and early twenties. I just got engaged and we were starting to plan a wedding.

For the first time in my life everything was going my way. All the hard work, struggle, and sacrifice finally paid off. Then here comes covid-Fucking-19 to shove a baseball bat wrapped in sandpaper straight up my ass without even much as spitting on it first. I got laid off from work in April and it was ok at first. We had thousands in savings for the wedding/rainy days, CERB was coming in like clockwork, and things were ok. 

Fast forward a couple of months later and apparently because the government fronted everyone $2000 right away they want that shit back. So for basically a month I only got half a payment and had to draw on my savings. Throw in a couple unexpected bills and the dog needing to go to the vet. Plus the government taking another $1000 to fully recover that $2000 advance in April and here we are. 

I’ve got $500 left to my name, CERB is over the first week of October, I don’t know when/if I’ll get my ei, and there’s no job prospects at all or any chance of returning to work by the end of the month. If I can’t find something by the end of this month I’m done. I’m going to have to move back to my home province on the other side of the country or be homeless in the one I’m living in. 

I know there are people out there in the same boat or in a much worse one. But I just really need to vent here. I’m so god damn stressed I can’t eat, I’m not sleeping, I’m legitimately at my wits end. I don’t want to move back home. Not like this, I wanted it to be on my own terms. Not forced to become I’m going to be homeless and broke if I don’t. Job prospects are even worse in my home province then they are where I’m to now. 

I just feel so hopeless and defeated everyday. I try to stay positive and strong for my fiancé. To be the rock she needs. But it’s just hard sometimes. I know I can talk to my fiancé but to be frank she isn’t a great person to talk to. She’ll either try and one up me or just say “I know it’s hard. But you got to hang In there”This is honestly the first time in my life if ever felt any kind of anxiety, depression, and even on the really dark days, suicidal. I always made the joke I’m worth more dead than alive. But because I’m not working and covered by my insurance Anymore I’m not worth a Fuckin cent lol. 

Fuck sakes I’d honestly give my left nut and first born for all this shit to be over and things go back to some form of the normal we had before. I really just want my life back and to stop feeling to god damn shitty all the time.

I just regret not being myself in school. I sat there all shy, people made fun of me for it. Kind of picked on me to try get a reaction. I think that made it even worse. Now that I’ve left school, I want to start being myself, more confident. But I’m worried that people will always think of me as the weird shy person from school. I know they probably will.

103,"
I think that in the end for some reason my mind only goes towards assuming and believing that self harm is the one true way to get some relaxation from my feelings. 

I’m not saying that I am hurting myself. The truth is I used to cut my body almost every alternative day, and these cuts very deep they’ve left scars all over my back now and I always ensure that I try to cover my body at all times. And srsly speaking, it felt fucking great after I was done (I am not recommending anyone hurt themselves in any way shape or form no matter the reasons, just because I feel great doesn’t mean you should try it), it went to the point where I was addicted to it. Every time I felt upset or had some form of emotional low I immediately resorted to cutting. 

Regardless, I’m not hurting myself and it’s been a few months since I did so. However I’m getting these lows that you feel during a healing stage and my mind is moving towards self harm as more of a solution rather than gym, studies, games etc....And also there’s a limit to how much I can control myself before acting impulsively again by hurting myself. 

I just want someone’s advice. What did you do? What did you do to stop self harming and what did you do to ensure that you don’t get back into it again.",17Sep2020,1

107,"The mental illness is DP/DR otherwise known as depersonalization disorder, I thought I shared as I seriously think people should know more about it, just because its not nearly as known as thing's like OCD, schizophrenia etc.

Basically what it is is that its similar to psychosis, in that nothing feels real anymore, but without any voices in your head, or delusions. Its very scary though, it nearly feels like the ground below you doesn't exist and nor do you exist, and it feels like your dissapearing this has happened to me multiple times during one time, it was so bad that I was with my dad returning with my dad from therapy, that I got out of the car, and started attacking the car punching it with all my might, because the Depersonalization was so bad and was essentially freaking out because I was dissapearing.

Depersonalization is also really bad because in a way it can reform your identity when, you lose your sense of self. That when you do finally return back to normal, you arent the same anymore, and not nearly as motivated to do the things you used to like doing because your sense of self isn't entirely there.

It also leads to a decline in cognitive abilities during some days of dissciation it was so hard for me as to write a simple paragraph, as my sense of self and logic was so far off which can lead to alots of excessive procrastination as your essentially a zombie. 

Sometimes it can peaceful, as your worries are gone much of the time from you not having an identity, but more often than not its just plain destructive and scary.

For those that have ever done Psychedelics or had a bad trip, its essentially like that, and not knowing who you anymore, or where you are. But randomly throughout your day, the intensity of it varies but usually occurs when i think of something stressful.",17Sep2020,1

115,"I have my next appointment with my psychiatrist soon. Everytime I talk to her I fail to explain how I really feel like and play it down in the terms of ""If I managed to get here, it's not that bad"". I'm not just depressed and hear some voices, I'm constantly tired and deassociate from my body and the world. If my body says no to a movement I can't overcome it. I experience the world as if I was watching it trough a tunnel from very far away and my perception of anything feels numb and blurried. I don't identify either with my body or with my thoughts. It's not even feeling like it is me who lives in this body. I can't follow simple instructions or learn anything as I'm kind of mentally blacking out every few minutes, seeing as how I'm stuck at driving school for over an year because hours of practice daily just vanish into a black void.

No matter how hard I try to explain it to my therapist and my psychiatrist, it's seems like they only understand it as over dramatic metaphor. No I'm fucking serious. Maybe I shouldn't reply with ""yes"" to ""You know it isn't real?"" to make my point clear? How does me knowing that voices in my head are not real suddenly makes the issue irrelevant though?

116,"
My parents were separated before I was born as they had already figured out they were no where near compatible. Naturally my mother began with custody of us. We lived on the east coast with her parents for a short period of time before moving to the Midwest. Once we got here we were generally watched by my grandmother. This was probably the best thing that ever happened to us as someone who was actually willing to make sure we were properly taken care of. I have memories waking up in the morning for school and going to get my mom and her just being gone. It happened a lot. When she didn’t leave she brought home creepy guys. I know what you’re thinking...no! No one molested us or anything like that. But these guys were assholes in general and boy was this uncomfortable. But it wouldn’t be long before my grandmothers advice would cause my mother to want to move back to the east coast. First move was easy. Now we had friends and someone to potentially take care of us. After my parents disputed child support my dad agreed to take custody of us. We were elated! We moved in with my father and a few months later he began dating someone from his job and asked us how we would feel if she lived with us with her kids.
Truthfully I remember being incredibly hesitant and saying no because I wasn’t comfortable. I was responded to with too bad. And it was. They all showed up and took over the house. That winter in the middle of the night my house burned down. I don’t know why this sits poorly with me. But I was the youngest of 4 children. And the last one to be woken up. The house was fully engulfed on my way out. We lived with my grandma after that pretty much indefinitely. I looked up to my father more than I could ever admit these days. He made constant promises he couldn’t stick to. It was incredibly depressing. And the worst part is id get my hopes up so high I would stare out the window all day long. Just to find out he wouldn’t come. Naturally I became a very angry kid and I told them both off. We never had a good relationship but I wanted my parents so badly it ruined me. Because they never wanted me.

Next chapter of my life my father had a good job on the road and I lived with grandma up until I was 15. This was the year my grandpa passed. Devastated my grandma moved to an assisted living facility. My sisters had all graduated and lived in my dads house. I resides in grandmas house. As an adult I think this probably the stupidest thing my father did. I was 15-18 living in a house by myself. My grandma had literally done everything for me so this was a huge shock. I don’t think a 15 year old should have to worry about making their own meals, shopping or laundry. But I was. And I was terrible at it. I was awful at making time. I was an irresponsible teenager left to figure it out. I could have dropped out of school and quit but I didn’t. I went to school with my dirty ass clothes every day actually. But soon graduation came and my step mother had been diagnosed with an injury. They had to come home and they immediately had the talk about my future and how it didn’t involve staying with them and they were done raising kids. 

I joined the military as it was the fastest thing to get me away from this place. This was a huge ass mistake. I enjoyed my experiences. And love my brothers and sister. But I got chosen as a firefighter in the Air Force. I made the best of it and did my time. And am dealing with repercussions of managing life at its most gruesome. Once my term was up my wife and our new baby to be headed home. Upon arriving my step mother had been severely hospitalized and unfortunately passed away very unexpectedly. Listening to her rasp to death is up there with the sounds that set me into a spiral. This death changed my father even further. He became irritable and incredibly aggressive. He often would stay up all hours of the night sending me page after page of hurtful messages how I’m a piece of crap. And I mean hurtful like things that if I’m saying to a loved one I’m never expecting to talk to him again. I’ve made a few attempts since but all go from civil to him degrading me very quickly. I don’t have time for that so these days I keep him blocked. 

After all this transpired my grandfather was diagnosed with sever dementia almost simultaneously with my moms cancer. She clearly needed help so I left my job and my house and almost all of my belongings to help her. My wife and I were treated like housekeepers. But she needed help so I shutup and just kept helping. I’m not going to go into a lot of detail but a fight broke out. My privacy was invaded by her husbands  camera that had recently been shifted to the bathroom right after my wife took a shower. As well as my lockbox being Pryed open. My guns were in that lockbox and my nephew of 9 was playing with my guns. I freaked out. My cancer ridden mother and I had a screaming match in the yard. She had got in my wives face which is insane considering she hardly opens her mouth especially in conflict. We drove back to Illinois on bad tires. And unfortunately I never spoke to my mom again. She took my sister and her family on a Disney cruise and failed to invite my daughter. This disgusts me as my 4 year old should not pay for my decisions.

My mother passed in December on Christmas  to which her whole new family sat around her. They all took turns telling me how messed up our fight was. It was terrible. Just over and over. Even her husband pulled me to the side and said look I’m still pretty pissed for that shit you pulled. This made my legs tremble and I just went completely numb emotionally. We listened to her until she stopped breathing which once again bothers me to no end. 
On top of this my moms funeral was in Maryland and I didn’t have the funds to get there. I asked my sister who was getting a ticket from our step dad. She said I would have to ask him myself. So Needless to say my pride got I the way. And I do regret it. My mom never really called regularly. We saw her once a year for a week and truthfully it was pretty miserable. Even in the military my family seemed to have forgotten I existed. So I figured her death wouldn’t really affect me. Obviously I’m wrong her death mixed with my unprocessed emotions and regrets is tearing me apart. On top of that I think my sister is having a mental break. Her and her husband are at the ends of their ropes wanting to separate. I feel irritability escalating and I’m terrified that the fucked up person I was before is being impacted and I’m going a little nuts. I’ve been snapping out on my kids and wife and don’t know why. I’m so tired of having to pick up these messes that I truly didn’t want to make and then asked to say sorry and take responsibility. But I’ve been trying to get them to take responsibility my whole life. I can’t imagine ever intentionally leaving my kid. This sounds like a giant pity party reading it but when I try to talk to my family it’s asked to be left in the past, or me apologize and I’m beginning to go crazy. 

I’m missing a lot here despite having included too much. I dont know where to start. But I haven’t processed shit since 2009.

I was more social. My family told me multiple times how happy I seemed.

Then school began. I can barely wake up. The stress of having the assignments prevents me from doing them, which adds more stress, which prevents me from doing anything else.

I think the only thing I can do is drop out.

My mother refuses to talk about it. She says it's giving her too much stress — to the point of physical symptoms. She does have a long history of extreme stress and panic attacks.

I graduated last year with a degree in film that hasn't landed me any long-term work, and I've been struggling to get on my feet with it. I already know it was pointless to get a film degree, but when I realised this I was halfway through my degree and actually would've been better off finishing it.

I did have two short-term jobs in film that were fun, but I don't think I did a good job on them and I haven't been done any jobs since last October or November, since then I've been working full-time in a bar. I've been looking for other jobs to get out of bar work but with COVID there's very few secure jobs about. I've been searching for film jobs and apply when they come, but I either never hear back or get rejected (even from trainee positions or internships).

I'm slowly working on a screenplay when I have the time, and with that I'll hopefully make a film with it out of my own money to try and show off what I can do, but like I said it's a slow process.

Right now I'm sick and tired of being in this position of trying and looking and never getting anywhere. I always told myself if I couldn't get anything around a year after graduating I'd stop, but something's telling me to keep going but I don't know how. I just feel like a big failure and that I've wasted a lot of effort. Even when I visit my granny she'll refer to the film career as ""failed"" and despite knowing she doesn't realise it, it actually hurts a lot when she says it.

A lot of the time I just want to get in the car and disappear, get away from my situation and forget about how things are but that's obviously not possible. I know I'm probably just putting too much pressure on myself, but I'm fed up with not getting anywhere that I hoped I would have.",17Sep2020,1

I know it sounds weird, but about three or four times a week I will have this intense and kind of frightening realisation that I exist and I’m a real person, after which I have to spend a few minutes going over things and reacquainting myself with who I am. It’s essentially like I forget that I’m here, doing whatever it is that I’m that I’m doing at the time.

What causes this kind of thing? Should I be alarmed? Is this the right place to ask this kind of question?",17Sep2020,1
128,"I’m sorry, I just need to vent.

About a year and a half ago I was transferred from the adolescents section of my mental health service into the young adult section. The adolescent section was brilliant, it turned my life around and helped me through so much, I was supported, understood, taken care of. 

Now you’d think that the same facility with the same upper management and the same people running the goddamned place would keep that standard all the way through right?

Well apparently not. The young adult ward treats 18-25 year olds. Yes we are adults, but we are mentally ill adults that need your help. The moment I was transferred I had to do everything in my own. All I was given was a Psycologist who is only concerned if my ADHD meds are working. And that’s it. 

I told him that I was doing bad. I told him that I needed extra support. I told him that I need that support soon. I’m not ok. I need help.

But no, all he does is give me two names of people he says have vacancies and sends me on my way. 

They do not have any space for me. No free space, no appointments. Nothing. He was wrong.

I am a person who’s day to day life is miserable. I have sever ADHD so remembering all the bullshit he expects me to is next to impossible. I’m extremely anxious so those goddamned phone calls I have to make only to get told “no, there are no free slots for 6 months” is awful.

This isn’t fair. I pay this man over €150 for 15 minutes of his time. The least he can do is give me the names of people who can actually treat me. I don’t need help in 6 months. I need help now.

It feels like it’s all just a ploy, a sham. I don’t want to live like this. I need their support, but it’s just not being given. I feel so failed. This isn’t right.

135,"This is kind of a long story so bear with me, I just need to write this out to vent and hopefully give me the help I need to just fall asleep for a while. Just a quick warning if you don’t like to hear about medical stuff or sick/dying pets/animals, maybe you should pass on reading this. 

A few months ago at the height of COVID in my state my father was in a really severe motorcycle accident and he completely shattered his femur in his leg and broke his clavicle as well. My dad has to have several surgeries from the accident but because of the pandemic I wasn’t allowed to visit or see him in the hospital for over 3 weeks. This was a really stressful time and my studies really took a nose dive. I am currently a college student and living at home to so all of my fathers care out of hospital fell squarely on my shoulders. It was incredibly difficult to take care of him because he is a 300+ lbs 6’+ tall man and I am a 5’4” small woman, and he wasn’t allowed to walk at all for over 4 months after the surgery. It was a lot of heavy lifting emotionally and physically. 

During those 4 months I had a little support from family members and friends but not much. My parents are divorced and my mom helped some during this time but my mom is a severe alcoholic so she didn’t help much. I also have a slightly younger brother who is already moved out of the house and refuses to speak to anyone in our family because he has his own mental health issues and he hates all of our guts. He completely abandoned me and refused to help at all with my dad... which really sucked to say the least. I was completely alone during this time in apart from a few close friends. 

My father was finally cleared to start walking again about a month ago and it looked like things were finally about to turn around. I started a new job, and I started graduate school as well, I was finally sort of happy again. But that’s when bad news struck 2 weeks ago and my dad broke his femur again just due to the bones being too weak and putting weight on them too soon. Additionally, the metal plate the surgeon put in his leg during the initial surgery 4 months ago completely broke in half. My dad needs surgery again and it’s going to be an even more intense surgery than the ones he’s had previously. 

On top of this one of my dogs (8ish years old) started to act really sick this past weekend and I had to take him into the vet. He was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease and he didn’t have good odds. However the dog held stable for a few days and we brought him home last night. He seemed to be doing well but in the middle of the night last night he passed away from a heart attack or stroke or seizure or something and there was nothing we could do he went so quickly. I haven’t been able to sleep all night because I can’t stop thinking about my little baby boy and I haven’t slept much for the past few days either. 

My dad goes in to surgery tomorrow and I’m really scared that he is going to have complications and die. I know it’s unlikely but I can’t stop worrying about it. I haven’t struggled with suicidal thoughts in a long time but because of everything that’s happened these last two weeks it’s at the forefront of my mind. I know I won’t do anything while my dad is still around but I’m just exhausted, drained, overwhelmed, scared out of my mind, and I just want it all to go away. I just don’t know how to stop thinking the bad thoughts and worrying about my dad and feeling sad about my dog. It’s all too much feeling. I need it to stop. 

I don’t know. That’s it. It helped to type that out. Maybe I can fall asleep finally.

136,"I’ll try to make this as short and to the point as possible. Anyone that actually hears me out, thank you. 

My whole life I’ve been dead set on going into healthcare. The women in my family have always done some form of medical work and I was raised believing I won’t ever make money if I’m not in healthcare. I’m now almost 22, four thousand dollars in the hole to get an entry level license and working in an emergency room. I’m miserable. 

I hate taking care of people and listening to them whine. I don’t care how much pain they’re in or how sick, I feel burdened by taking care of them. I’ve know for awhile this isn’t a good fit for me and I should probably start looking at a different career but this morning something happened that really made me start to think maybe something is wrong with me. 

I’m an hour into my shift and we get a critical patient on my hall. As I go into the room to get a EKG I overhear the doctor and family talking about how they should do a DNR (do not resuscitate) as the guy most likely won’t live anyway. As they continue talking it finally comes out that this guy is actively dying and most likely won’t live out the week. Instead of feeling sorry for him and his family, I continue hooking up the EKG and all I can think about is how they’ll be a pain to deal with because of all the crying and they’ll most likely be super needy. 

I’m just kind of appalled at myself that someone is actively dying in front of me and I can’t even pretend to care. Though it still doesn’t change anything as far as even having any sympathy. Is there a possibility that there’s actually something wrong with me?

I can't just jump in the shower in the mornings because I need to separate hair and body washing. I can't even cry without caution when I'm feeling down because I can't wet the wound.

Long ago, I was interested in anti-depressants and his effects on human livings, the most common thing to do was try it by myself, right?

The time passed I go to several therapists but everything was always the same, same boring and depressing routine of every day, days and nights asking myself I will achieve true happiness someday?

Now, this is the future, I'm in the future, the crappy future, I'm still depressed, things go the same, it's been years since my depression started and I think it becomes part of me, it's stuck to me.

I got my doctor to refill my antidepressant electronically (I called them and asked that they send it to the pharmacy). Because the form in which people take their meds is rarely on the physical prescription (mine wasn't, I have been taking this medication as capsules for about ten years now and I don't think it has ever been written as capsules on the script), there might be a mix up and you might get prescribed tablets instead because the online form requires it. 

Why I'm writing this- the med (a GENERIC, I might add) usually costs ~$10, now cost $400. That is not a typo. $400.

145,"Hey all, I feel I have neglected to figure out a side of myself that could be the detriment to many of my relationships.

Essentially I mostly feel emotion subconsciously, at least when I'm in a distinct moment that calls for an emotion. I'll drop a few examples below.

As a teenager we had a dog that I was inseparable from, she was sort of my secret therapy dog as I was bullied but didn't talk about it to my family. One week she got very sick and was likely gonna have to be put down (spoiler alert, she survived!) At night I remember distinctly trying to conjure tears, show some sort of emotion, but nothing would come up. Instead I hugged her I told her I loved her. I said this because though I felt completely numb, I knew logically, deep down it must be how I feel. Many years later when we did put her down, I was a broken mess. I mourned that dog for years.

Another example is later in life my mother told me and my brother she had cancer, albeit a less dangerous form but she did not play it off that way. As anyone would be, she was very nervous about it. When I first heard the news, I was expecting shock from myself, i expected a shooting tingle of terror down my spine, but in reality I felt nothing. In fact I soon became nervous and had to pretend to be terrified, I went and hugged her and comforted her while nervous like this. A month later she was having surgery and I stayed in the car for the first half of the operation to catch up on some sleep, I believe work kept me up, and I had the most simultaneously abstract yet lucid nightmare of floating above the operating table watching them hack her up. When I woke up I immediately went into the hospital waiting room to be with the rest of my family. The operation was a success btw.

A last quick example is that my fiance's favorite cousin had suddenly passed away and she was completely shocked and broken up about it. I comforted her but also couldn't conjure any authentic shock or sadness. The thing is I can reflect on this cousin of hers and feel sad but if I'm in the moment when something happens I feel nothing.

I don't like feeling fake; being neurotic and in my head all the time about emotions I don't feel. I'd like to know if this is common or if it sounds like anything diagnosible you folks have heard of. 

All this aside I have been diagnosed with depression and I'm trying to get tested for ADHD, if symptoms for those contribute to it.

Her: ""You can't say it, can you?""  


Me: No, I am sure you can see the long version in my chart.u'

Her: (I forget what she said before this) ...Yes, I can see it in the notes what you're talking about (the Pyromania)...the fire-setting, right?

So, she just basically confirmed that the shorter version IS in my chart. I don't know why this 

libothers me...this hasn't been a surprise to me for quite a LONG time now (I have accepted it pretty much completely) so why the hell does knowing that the actual disorder, Pyromania, is on paper make me so sad and uncomfortable?

152,"When I think about depression I think about people with no ambitions in life jst slowly dying away in their bed because they have no motivation to do anything. And suicidal etc. Well this is what depression was from personal experience.

But when people explain their “depression” to me. They seem to either have mild depression or jst off days which they class as depression. And complain that they’re not prioritised by the healthcare system in the UK even though they’ve been waiting for a long time to be seen by a professional. 

I know it’s unfair of me to say that it’s okay for ppl with milder symptoms to be of a lower priority, because I know ppl who are impulsive or have a history of suicidal attempts. Or even severe mental health issues that need more professional help than they do so their waiting isn’t a big of a deal. 

I think the general social media has messed up the severity of depression in its wake of enlightening them. More so now than ever before because if someone says they’re depressed ppl usually come up with oh “meditate” or “think positive thoughts” or “focus on the bright side” etc. And acc severely depressed ppl or mental health issue ppl come across as insane for self harming or neglecting to take care of themselves.

158,"This is a very, very long one.

I just moved into a new studio apartment (One room with bed and kitchen with 1 ensuite bathroom) with my boyfriend for our secong year of university about 2 weeks ago. We've been together for about 1 1/2 years now, and before we met I was a tangled mess of mental health issues and substance abuse, and tried to commit suicide every couple of months or so. He's an amazing person and has been slowly helping to fix me with his kindness and compassion. Over the summer we tackled my drug addiction, which took a huge toll on our relationship and now we've moved into a new, small place where we're forced to be around each other 24/7 and I think he's near the end of his patience.

I struggled to pack up, but managed to throw all my stuff in the car just in time to not make us late moving in, and parents helped to dump it all in the place. I've been very anxious and stressed due to the whole situation, and my partners has been incredibly, incredibly stressed having to mostly organise it all himself. Anyway, we unpacked the general homely things together on the first day, and by the third day, my partner had unpacked and orgainsed all his stuff into the new home. It's now like 2 weeks and currently a bunch of my belingings are strewn all over the floor 'being organised' and making it difficult to get around the room. It's been like this for days, and I'm still not even close to being finished.

Every morning I pop to the pharmacy for medicine that makes me very, very sleepy then the rest of the day consists of me falling or almost falling asleep, wasting large quantities of time unnecessarily on the toilet, picking at my skin and generally dawdling. The one that pisses my partner off the most is when I spend 1-5 hours a day sitting in the only bathroom we have, ripping open infected scabs and sores on my breasts and poking/scratching/sniffing/picking them. It. Is. Disgusting. And it wastes a lot of time, damages my body, and kills my partners desire to get intimate with me. But now that there's a mess on the floor for me to clean, and a bunch of other chores to do/help with, which pisses him off even more, not to mention that he has to hold any need for the toilet in.

Whenever I do this, my partner gets very angry, depressed, frustrated and fed up with me, he tries to coerce me out, shouts at me etc out of frustration. I get very nervous and scared of shouting and feel very very very guilty for causing him these feelings and for being essentially useless and leaving him to do all the important things like bills and chores and leaving him to live in a tip when he's a very clean-loving person. But I just can't stop myself from doing it. No matter what the stakes are, the urge and the satisfaction I get are far too strong for me to fight and I don't know why. I don't understand why my brain won't let me be productive and happy. This whole situation is horrible, and I just feel so so awful and suicidal and like my bf doesn't even love me anymore and I just don't know what the fuck to do. I'm still waiting to be assigned a therapist, but that might take months...",17Sep2020,1

161,"I’m sharing this article because I think it flipped a switch in my brain that allowed me let go of some of the anxiety associated with the pandemic. I’m completely guilty of thinking “when this is over” thoughts, or making “when this is over” plans with my friends. I see how that can stop me from just enjoying life as it is, especially if there is no closure to this thing. Maybe you will also find it helpful.

[There Won’t Be a Clear End to the Pandemic](https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/09/pandemic-over-end-how-will-we-know/616372/)

TLDR: the end of this pandemic will be a slow fade and Coronavirus will most likely never be eradicated. Best to mentally prepare for the new norm and don’t expect an overwhelming sense of closure.

I notice that I experience some pretty heavy duty brain fog and dizziness, I just feel really out of it. I am on medication (vyvanse) so I’m not sure if that has anything to do with it or not. I’ve thought that maybe I’m suffering from some sort of deficiency or something but I’m not sure. I haven’t really talked to my doctor about this all that much, though I know I should. I have been know to masturbate excessively though, at minimum once a day. I have no guilt towards masturbating either, I’m not religious nor was it ever discouraged growing up.

167,"Hi, to preface this as a trigger warning this deals with sexual assault to a minor. I don't want to upset anyone, I just need to get this off my chest. 


So, to start off:
I have nothing diagnosed nor have I ever been in therapy or anything like that. I can barely recollect my childhood, up till 10 years old. 

Lately I've been working on myself, doing journaling, sitting with my feelings, etc. It was one moment during my work where I randomly remembered something. At first I thought I was imaging it, before asking my parents. 

I was 8 years old, playing on a trampoline in my backyard. I had no fence yet. It was raining, I was wearing a white t shirt that was very big on me and underwear. This is pretty normal in my household for younger children, we're Russian immigrants. 
I had a neighbor in his teens, who walked to my backyard and ushered me to the side of the house out of view of my mom and her friend from the window. 

I had no reason to distrust him. He was a good friend of my older sister. I run over to him, thinking he wanted to talk to me. Then he suddenly pins me against the wall and begins to french kiss me and touch my privates. (This is the only part I remembered.) 

My mom is definitely a momma bear. She filled me in on this bit. She saw me run off and immediately went after me. (I tended to get lost as a kid, so this was normal.) She saw my neighbor, and immediately took me into the house and went to his grandmother's. They talked, his grandmother profusely apologized, begged my mom not to press charges. 

My family discussed it. Before they could make a decision, the neighbor was taken to juvy for something else. So they dropped the idea. The neighbor ended up being in prison later on and the family moved away. 

I'm kind of hurt that charges weren't pressed but, my family and I don't really have faith in the system, especially regarding children. I just feel dirty and gross. I don't know how to describe everything else I'm feeling. My brain feels like it's not there and I'm on auto pilot. I'm trying hard to do self care. 

Thanks for reading, sorry if this story made you upset. I've only told two people in my life who should know and I'm struggling with processing it.",17Sep2020,1

I work an hour and 20 minutes from my house 60+ hours a week, I’m in school full time and I miss my partner because we never see each other. I am a minimalist for mental health reasons (everybody in my family are hoarders) and I have noticed myself starting to buy a ton of stuff that I don’t need (food, decor).

170,"I just can't focus. I forget when own train of thought constantly. I'm 17 and have no high school education. I just could not focus - trying to buckle down and do something - even articulating my own thoughts - feels like wading through quicksand. All I've done for the past four years is try to keep myself calm. I knew there was something more to my inability to focus than aspergers and anxiety.

Diagnosable or not I want something done about my concentration- I can't even do basic maths sometimes. I'm exhausted. All I can do is surf online, go out for a walk once a day, think of writing a story or making a youtube video, get depressed by not doing it, and repeat.

I don't want to be calm. I don't want be gifted (or differently wired if you want me to punch you) I want to live.

In junior high my my brother and the rest of my peers seemed an entire world away. They actually doing things. Not academically per se, but experiencing things. Finding interests, social lives, making mistakes, living life. And there I was in the common room - with a Kindle.

I don't know what to do anymore. I wrestled with loneliness and self worth for so long. This isn't the first time I've ranted about it.

171,"This COVID-19 pandemic is putting a lot of strain in the mental health of our medical professionals, causing burnout and the tragic loss of Dr. Lorna Breen, an NYC ER doctor, by suicide in April.

Did you know that physicians have double the rate of suicide compared to the general population? Today is National Physician Suicide Awareness Day, a reminder that we must do more to support the mental health of physicians.

When 44% of physicians are burned out and 300+ physicians die by suicide every year, mental health should be a huge priority in the field of medicine. Instead we see a culture of silence, in which physicians keep their mental health struggles under the radar to escape scrutiny by licensing boards, residency programs, employers or even their peers, or when mental health issues may be seen as red flags by adcoms for those aspiring to enter the medical profession. Breaking this culture of silence is the first step in dismantling stigma.

That’s why it’s so important to share your story – Medical Minds Matter is a place where physicians and pre-med/medical students can share their mental health struggles with the option of staying anonymous because we want to include even those that are not willing to do so publicly.

I thought I could cope on my own because it didn’t seem too serious, and I was probably just faking, but shit’s getting hard.


I tried to kill myself last June, and I got a trigger earlier this morning during online classes.


My chest is constantly hammering. My hobbies don’t make me happy anymore. Painting used to be an escape, some kind of vent for how I feel, but it’s not working anymore.


Recently, I’ve been feeling like taking risks. I’m scared of heights to death, but I wanted to go skydiving yesterday. I wanted to know what it was like to fall. I wanted to go motorcycle racing. I wanted to see how high I could fall off before I hurt myself. I want to do something that makes my heart beat even faster.


I want professional help, but I don’t know where to get it. My family told me it’s my fault I’m so miserable, and my friends can’t exactly do anything about this because we’re all underage.

I blacked out entire class periods, where my only memory was hearing the bell ring to start class, and what felt like 30 seconds later the bell rang again to end class. Realizing that I was backing out was so horrying to me, I ended up in therapy for almost 2 years because of it, and after I ended therapy I felt pretty okay. I've been out of high school for 8 years now, I've been married, had 2 kids, and divorced. During a bout of post partum depression I blacked out and somehow broke my phone, and had a few therapy sessions for that as well. It's been 6 years since my last black out.

175,"I have been in and out of the mental health system loads in the past. My manic episodes are very apparent. I am on meds for that. I haven’t spoken to the doctors about my feelings for a long time. It’s rare I have to see them. Usually only if I’m having a medication review or if I’ve gone manic. When I’ve spoken to them before I would often talk about how I feel like I lost my personality etc. I didn’t go through any trauma but I did sort of get emotionally distraught over specific events but I improved although that’s when the manic episodes started. For a while I noticed my social skills and my outgoingness went down. I feel like I’m not very motivated in life and nothing interests me. I also get introspective a lot where I’m trying to give myself feedback. I can be cynical a lot and I can function but I feel like I am really lazy. Most hobbies I get fed up of too. I know it’s probably only mild if anything. It’s not that I feel necessarily sad but I can relate to the “empty” feeling it can also be described as. Sometimes I feel like I got all the labels in the world. Some labels I have considered before are schizoid, adhd and social anxiety. My main problems are lack of confidence, motivation, rumination, avoidance, discipline, idleness, self loathing, this is obviously aside from the manic episodes. Has anyone got any ideas?

190,"So currently I'm in quarantine and I'm 20, taking classes online while at home with my parents (my school moved to almost entirely remote learning). Personally, I've never felt depressed or suicidal or anything. But I have had a lot of problems. Growing up, I never really had any friends or hung out with anybody outside of class. I didn't even know that people spent time hanging out until I was about 17. When I was younger (like middle school and beginning of high school), I had forced my self to ask out a few girls, all of which rejected me. This led to immense resentment towards women for a time period. Like I literally told people ""I hate women"" because that felt better than admitting I had no clue how to talk to girls. There were other changes as well, but not very important to this topic. I've also never had any good social skills for the most part. I tend to be really awkward most of the time, especially around girls. I had made up for this in very strange ways throughout my life. While in college, I tried to made friends but ended up ruining all my relationships by either saying something completely inappropriate or just not gaining any respect from others. I have decent grades/ career prospects but have no social contacts or connections. I've never had a religion and have little meaning in life other than working out. Up until just before quarantine, I began to see some change. I actually got up the confidence to talk to a girl at a party and ended up kissing her. I tried to make amends with some people I had previously wronged and also got a Tinder. Then, quarantine hit and all of this changed. I haven't talked to hardly anybody my age in a while, making quarantine very difficult on me personally. Our school also is likely going to extend remote learning to take up next semester. Don't really have any way of talking to people now. Was wondering if anybody had any advice, or thinks therapy would work.",17Sep2020,1
191,"I'm sure I'm not alone in this, during this crazy time, but this is a familiar feeling to me. 

I grew up in a church-heavy home as a pastor's kid - one of those situations where even if you're not okay, you have to be okay for the sake of an image. For most of my life I believed I was totally fine, completely okay, happy, and my family was essentially the ""model"" family. 

I dealt with heavy guilt, crippling anxiety/panic attacks, and stress all my adolescent years and pretended it was never there. My family saw it a few times, but at the time it was smoothed over with church-related phrases and the idea that I should turn to God rather than getting some help. Please don't misunderstand, I still consider myself religious and love my religion, but that was a toxic church environment that I broke away from. When I went to college, it reached a breaking point.

Finally, I moved out on my own after graduating and hoped to stimulate healthy habits in my life through some separation and independence from my family. Now, I just feel so lost. 

I feel as though I have lost all joy from things. I'm constantly focused on others and I can't even remember if there are things I was passionate about for me. I have no idea what I love to do or have any desire to do those things.

And the whole time, I feel guilty for not doing those unknown ""things."" There are many days that I don't recognize myself in the mirror and I'll take a video of myself and rewatch and have no idea who that person is. 

This part of my anxiety, fog-riddled brain is new. Or maybe it's just that being out of school and working from home full-time with a pandemic on the loose is giving me way too much time to dwell on the things I never nurtured before.

Either way, I wanted to post something to see if I'm going crazy or it's not just me.

203,"Hello all :) I am new to this sub, but glad I have found it, and figured I would ask a question I have been mulling over for the past couple of weeks. 

What you need to know: I have been seeing my therapist for over a year now, I am on anti-depressants, and I have diagnosed OCD, generalized anxiety, and depression.

Question: I struggle to finish just about anything, and its driving me insane. I absolutely hate it, and this has mostly gone on since I experienced the worst death in my life 3 years ago. I am not actively grieving anymore, but I used to be able to sit and become absorbed in a book, and then finish it in just a day or two. I would play a game straight through. I was would binge my favorite tv series. 

Now? I have to do multiple things. I can't sit and watch tv/movies. It drives my husband nuts, but I am getting up every few minutes to go do something, or take care of something. It really takes me about an hour to settle out of these habits.   


If I am reading or playing a game, I have an eraser I consistently and almost constantly rub, but I also have to stop every 5-10 minutes to look at my phone or do something else.   


I've read 9 books this year. 9. That is an all-time low for me. I used to be able to get through 30-50 a year. I ALWAYS had a book with me.   


I DO try to push through these habits, but then my mind wanders. I try to finish a book series, and I'm bored by book 3 and have to move on to something else. I typically bounce from book to book, sometimes reading between 2-3 at a time. This is going to sound bad, but the only time I was able to really push through a task was when I was on painkillers from surgery. I can't even relax on my lunch breaks - I have to go to the Y and go swim, or go walk, or run some errands. I've maybe sat through ONE lunch break since December.

Does anyone else experience something similar? If so, how did you combat this type of habit/behavior?",17Sep2020,1
205,"I’ve always been a socially awkward as a child and still have that part of me in my teenage years. As a child i barely had any friends and hated being seen with no friends. I eventually grew out most of it in freshman year of high school and thats when my vitiligo started to spread. Over the years of high-school i began to gain more confidence and improved my social skills. But over quarantine my Vitiligo spread significantly so its really easy to see my Vitiligo on my face and body. Im really self consious about my Vitiligo and people in my family talk about it casually to my other family members or their friends and i really hate that. I feel like im an outcast to my classmates as im short (5’3) and have a Vitiligo. My confidence has been affected by my Vitiligo as i try to hide it with clothes that cover my body. I feel like my Vitiligo affects me socially and when people bring my Vitiligo up i get my a bit offended and try to change the subject. I really want to not be affected by my Vitiligo and just to be more confident like i have it and just not care about me having it. How can i be more confident and not let my self consciousness get better of me?

On the other Hand though, i have started to get panic attacks for the last 6 Months. i have always had weird ticks, like winking and counting steps, and everything always has to be either an even number that is somehow related to the number 24

so I am not quite sure whether I am being an over thinker, but it hasn´t been going too well the last years and since I feel like I will only bother friends and don´t want them to feel bad, that's why I'm writing this.

I have had Suicidal thoughts from like 2015 to 2017, but all that has bettered now. On the other Hand though, i have started to get panic attacks for the last 6 Months. i have always had weird ticks, like winking and counting steps, and everything always has to be either an even number that is somehow related to the number 24, but I guess I can live with that, only sometimes they get really bad, but never in the same situations as the panic attacks. Those have never had a reason or trigger, they just come out of nowhere. I don't even know if they are panic attacks, as I said I never open up and am kind of the confident extrovert in my friends group. Additionally my circulatory system has always had problems and I´ll start to shiver out of nowhere, but always when something worries me. I have a Cat and when i see him everything is okay again, but since its my families cat I don´t get to see him too often.

The quarantine has not bettered the situation, my panic attacks become more and more regular events and I am starting to feel like my room is a prison. Usually I meet with friends to ignore my ""problems"", but recently I have had a panic attack while two friends where with me, and I since haven´t really met anybody. I don't want anyone to worry, since honestly my Life has been great and I  have good education, just got accepted into uni and life in a good neighborhood, have friends and a Band. But it just keeps getting worse and I don´t want to fall back into the suicide thoughts.

Is this bad? I have never been to a doctor because of all that, but is it bad enough that I should go? Or do anything about it.

The fact that we are not accountable for the childhood/adolescent exploitation that led to our ‘mental’ dysfunction does not absolve us of the adult responsibility to do something about it.

Many of us avoid learning about the causes and symptoms of our disorder as if ignoring it will make it go away. When we see evidence that the traits and characterizations of the disorder match our own, it somehow makes it more concrete, more real. *It makes us accountable*. Although all the relevant data is readily available from credible sources, including the National Institute of Mental Health, Johns Hopkins, the Mayo Clinic, remaining uninformed perceptually abrogates responsibility.

When something is broken, it is deconstructed to analyze the problem. We isolate the components and acquaint ourselves with their objectives. Equal effort is required for the brokenness in us. We must study the traits and symptoms of our disorder, and recognize how they affect our thoughts and behaviors. For us to have any chance at recovery, we need to know what we are recovering from. Replacing or repairing defects is fruitless without knowing what those defects are and how they function. Before a football team faces their opponent, they watch hours of film, review stats, and practice. If an actor wishes to give a good performance, it is prudent to learn the character’s lines before getting on stage. Our disorder is our enemy; it is unhealthy, and it hurts us. Our deliberate ignorance is denial, and that is a deal-breaker. Our disorder will continue to impact our emotional wellbeing and quality of life until we recognize, accept, and confront it.

Recovery-remission is a psychological construct. The revelation we are not responsible for the disorder sets the foundation for recovery. Understanding that we alone are the agents of change begins the construct. Counselors and programs provide the blueprint, but we erect the edifice. The disease model tells us what is wrong with us. We do not need to hear that. Our disorder is not something that can be excised like a tumor, so what is the point of telling us what is wrong with us? The wellness model’s focus and by extension, positive psychology and other optimistic approaches, is on our virtues and strengths.

One group of psychologists describes recovery as “people (re-) engaging in their life on the basis of their own goals and strengths, and finding meaning and purpose through constructing and reclaiming a valued identity and valued social roles.” [\[i\]](https://robertmullenca.wordpress.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=359&amp;action=edit#_edn1) Enduring recovery grounds itself on our knowledge of our disorder and the implementation of our character strengths and virtues to recover from it.",17Sep2020,1

214,"There's a girl at my work that I'm pretty close with, she tells me most things. But I obviously have no idea what goes on at her home and behind closed doors. She's 24. She has been in a relationship with this guy for about 4 years, he always has no money, as he spends it on drugs and alcohol. She does do drugs, nothing serious just weed or the odd psychedelic. She's not a heavy drug user by any means. She's told me she doesn't even like them and only does it because her bf does. She came in to work the other day after getting back from a weekend away with her boyfriend. She told me they had both had a huge argument and she left him. According to her, her boyfriend got drunk and was going through her phone reading all her messages to other guys, including messages to me. They were nothing bad at all, just normal conversation stuff but he clearly seems over protective and doesn't like her talking to other guys. Then she showed me a bunch of bruises on her arms and on her back. She insisted her boyfriend didn't do it intentionally. And he just pushed her away as she was trying to get her phone back when he was going through it. I personally don't believe this, as the bruises were all over he arms. I didn't believe it for one second. I said to her ""it doesn't matter if he did it intentionally or not, you're still covered in bruises"". As she was defending his actions. I caught her crying by herself on a lunch break. But I left her alone, as she had just got out of a 4 year relationship, and I felt she just wanted some space. I did made it clear to her though later that day, that I was always there if she needed anything and I was just a phone call away.

She wasn't taking the break up well. She told me they had arguments in the past, and broke up multiple times. But they always made up and got back together. This time though she said it's different. She told me life is too short, and it's not a healthy relationship and it's over for good now. Due to the bruises her family have been supporting her, telling her she's doing the right thing ending it. Everyone has been trying to be as supportive as they can, including myself. Yesterday she was fine, I was talking to her for hours, she was acting like nothing was wrong. But today, she didn't show up to work and phoned in sick. Then she started messaging another one of my work colleagues that she's letting everyone down, and that she doesn't see the point in living. And was saying multiple times she wanted to just kill herself. Which is well out of character for her. She is usually a really strong, confident individual. She told this other work colleague not to tell anyone. But due to what she was saying, the other work colleague told me as I'm the only other person close to her. So she doesn't know that I know she's been saying she wants to kill herself. This other work colleague went straight to her house and was with her for a couple of hours. I told them to keep me updated on her. They told me she had been up all night drinking and had now gone to bed, and for me not to worry. I sent her a DM saying ""hope everything is ok, I'm free all day if you need anything, just let me know"". As I wasn't supposed to know anything. I made it seem like I was just concerned for her not showing up to work. She replied back about 4hours later saying. ""Sorry, I've just woke up, not been feeling to good. I'll talk to you tomorrow at work"". 

That's the situation right now. I'm just stressing out and feeling helpless. My thoughts are that this now ex boyfriend has been very controlling and she is terrified of taking that step to actually leaving him. Like I said at the start, I don't know what goes on behind closed doors, and I have no idea what he could be saying to her in private DM's. But for her to start saying she hates her life and wants to die. Is so out of the norm for her. She was drunk tbh, but I personally can't ignore someone when they say things that due to stuff that's happened in my life. I want to be there for her as it's heart breaking seeing her suffering so much as she has a heart of gold and wouldn't hurt a fly. She always worries about others before herself. And I think in this case that's her downfall. She needs to think about herself and sort her own life out. I don't want to keep asking her if she is ok, and the same old stuff. As that could be more annoying. I've told her twice now in the last couple of days that I'm always just a phone call away. I'm not great with things like this. I just wanted to know if anyone knows the best thing I could do for her in this situation. As I feel this isn't just her getting over a break up. I feel like there may be more happening behind closed doors that I don't know about with her now ex boyfriend.",17Sep2020,1
215,"While your Father is upstairs and Mother out for a walk you hastily unwrap some free mini chocolates you managed to sneak into the house via your bra from someone's birthday at work. You have the TV blaring so no tell tale wrapper crinkles give you away. The microwave is out back but you make sure to check your back and catch it way before it beeps. Cornflakes are more difficult but you manage. You know every point at which the kitchen door creaks and cough over it, you know every creaky floor board and avoid them with practised ease. You manage to mix up your concoction and think success! But your Mother is keying at the door, a common tactic, coming back in to ""retrieve her phone"" the one that she left with already in her hand in the first place. You hastily shove the bowl in the back freezer and pretend to make tea. She does her sweep, unhappily satisfied for the moment and heads out again. 

You manage to sneak back barefoot and measure each step. You eat in the dark with the freezer light the only thing illuminating your face like a racoon out the bin. Hasty spoonfuls painfully churning with the gnawing sense of panic at the pit of your stomach. You suddenly think what a terrible idea this all was. You were doing so well with your diet and this is all too reminiscent of your teenage binges. Ears sharp, eyes trying to make out any distant movement like your life depends on it. 

You think to yourself this can't be normal, this can't be life. But you remember you're a 27 year old graduate who was supposed to have the world as your oyster. Only your once bright mind fizzled in the thick smog like darkness. All the ""why can't you bes"" the ""if onlys"" a rising shrieking cacophony of silent agony. You long to be 11 again and full of blissfully ignorant potential. But you're tired, worked 50 hours and ate too many god damn salad leaves this week. You just want one thing, one treat to yourself. You did good, hit your targets and stuck to bloody broccoli. You think tomorrow is a new day, one blip doesn't ruin everything. You hear footsteps and come to violently, in a blind panic you dump the rest in the bin, hastily cleaning the bowl with boiling water even though it scaulds you. 

Heart thudding you make sure everything is in it's right place. Because you got that sought after poorly paid industry job because you're ""detail orientated"". Only your employers don't know you're accurate because there's a crawling beneath the skin of your neck that makes you check a document exactly twenty times. They don't know you're so perceptive because you got used to reading a room as a matter of mental survival. 
But you managed it, you got off scot free! You sit down huddled away behind a closed door relishing the moments because of a dictorian ""open door policy"". You watch cartoons on mute because you're still a child inside, maybe you even sleep with a bear in secret. You just want something to hold on to.

216,"I have a never ending feeling of embarrassment, guilt and self-hatred, and I’m not sure if it’s “normal” anymore. My constant feeling of embarrassment stems from suddenly remembering old memories at random times, which leads to self hatred and guilt in a way. These memories are mostly me doing something with a negative consequence, usually something small  (other more serious things also do come to mind) and insignificant things. Usually these small stupid memories are exaggerated in my mind but when more serious things appear I feel more upset. This is also accompanied with intrusive thoughts. 

These flashbacks and other factors did cause depression for me for several years, with two years ago being suicidal. While I do have anxiety and understand that I’m working through my depression and feeling as if I’m out of it, I cannot work out what this is and why it happens.

These flashbacks happen at random times, make me feel uncomfortable, angry and upset. When it happens I usually start squeezing myself/hands, fidgeting etc. I do fidget a lot on a daily basis and these things also happen when I feel suddenly at unease or anxious. Another horrible coping mechanism is picking at my skin, usually my nails, face and shoulders. Again - this all happens at times when there’s no need to feel this way, yet I do and my mind drives me there. I’ve been dealing with this since I was 7 and I just want to be free.",17Sep2020,1
217,"I’m a 22 y.o female and I have two beautiful children and an amazing fiancée. I’m in school for something I enjoy, I have an associates in something else practical, I’ve been through a lot more than most my age and I feel like I have a pretty fair grip on life and reality. 
But I’m not happy with myself. I never have been. I spent years of my child hood dealing with emotional abuse that was never owned up too and I don’t think ever will be. So I know that probably has a lot to do with my constant mindset of self hatred and unhappiness. I look in the mirror every single day and hate every bit of what I see. Objectively I can say “I know I’m not an unattractive person” but my eyes tell me something else. Objectively I can say “I know I’m not overweight even though I definitely could lose 10 lbs and be happier with myself” but I delete every picture of myself and hate the way I look in everything I wear. I hate going out in public because people will look at me and surely think “yuck”. I wanted to join the military or be a firefighter and instead I’m a stay at home mom. And while I appreciate the importance of what I am doing in raising children....I’m unhappy. I spent years telling myself I was a bad person. And that everything bad that happened to me was God punishing me for not being a good enough Christian, was payback for having an opinion as a teenager, was just the cards I was dealt in life because of how shitty of a human being I was inside and out. I occasionally have days where these thoughts aren’t so loud. But they are still always there. On my bad days I don’t eat because I think maybe I could just starve myself into being happy. On my bad days I hate being a mom. On my bad days I want to run away and never come back. On my bad days I lay on the couch all day and can’t see the point in anything I’m doing because what does it matter I’m failing at it anyway. I know this is probably a lot of people who also struggle but ... it always feels so personal to me because it feels like a huge hole right in the middle of my chest. Literally. Idk why I’m posting here, probably because I don’t have anyone I know on here and I’m really tired of just keeping it to myself.

218,"I think this is the flair that fits best.

First off, I’m 12 (year 8) so there isn’t much I can personally do to improve my situation that I know of. I feel very out of control in life, everything is boring. There is nothing to look forward to in life anymore. I don’t have any drive to do things I like, like drawing or playing vr.
My life is just, wake up, go to school, come back.
I don’t know if this is depression because Ik it’s a stereotype that all teens claim they’re depressed. I just don’t really se a point to anything. If nothings gonna change then I’m just doing the same things for years until I grow up. If I really am depressed or going into depression, I am sensible enough to know that despite any urges I might get later on, I do NOT want to self harm or kill myself. I am very logical and I am also atheist so I think even if my life is boring, if I killed myself it just stops so I might as well just go along with whatever life has. Also if I ended up self harming which I am scared about. I have dealt with two of my friends self harming and don’t want to put them through the stress that I went through helping them.

I really don’t know what to do but if I end up dead in a year imma be pissed.
I don’t know wether these are signs or I’m just looking to far into this but I don’t want to feel like this and I am sensible enough to ask for help (at least online) when I start to feel like this.

I don’t know wether I need help or if this is just the stereotype depression that all teens get, so please let me know if I should get help because Ik people on the outside looking in will be able to make better decisions than me, especially since they will be older.

220,"I'd like to preface this post by saying: do not tell me I made a bad decision with my treatment. Do not tell me that ECT is primitive or it shouldn't exist. Keep it to yourself. 

I'm not often sad because of my memory damage from electroconvulsive therapy because it gave me my life back. 70+ sessions and it's the only reason I'm still here, functional. It actually saved my life and I would tell anyone who was in my exact situation that it's a good idea for them to try (especially because 95% of people getting ECT don't need many sessions at all, only around 10. I was getting it on a maintenance basis which is relatively rare, and the only reason my memory damage is so extreme. Also most people use a less intense form of the procedure that has fewer side effects.) 

But I was reading about autobiographical memories for my psych class and I cried for the first time over my memory loss. The textbook was describing how memories of your life make you who you are and... I just have lost so much. I just recently learned that I went to my highschool graduation. A lot of my childhood is gone. 

ECT was sooooo worth it, I wouldn't have ANY memories if I was dead. I have lived to be an adult in University with a loving girlfriend and an obsession with chess. But... Goddammit, have I lost sight of my original self? 

Not that that necessarily is a bad thing because I hated myself so much, but I now have accepted that those feelings were unwarranted. 

I know this: I am now a new version of myself who is alive and creating NEW memories to define who I am, and that's a miracle from my perspective! But... I'm still sad... all these experiences and facts about myself gone into the ether :( 

Again, nothing is wrong about ECT. You know what the risks are going into it, it can work miraculously, and it's pretty rare for anyone to get as many sessions that I have. I'm a pro ECT advocate. But still, I'm sad.",17Sep2020,1
221,"My older sister is in her late 40s, since she was young she had mental health issues but my father refused to get her mental help because he claims they will poison her with meds.

He said just pray, turns out my father has signs of a person with paranoia and narcissism, he believes my mom was cheating she has no friends because he told her they will brainwash her to cheat and she never cheated or flirted with any man and yet he was the one always flirting with women and with a perverted mind, basically whatever he did he thought others were doing too but pretend he never did them and accused others. So we think my sister got her mental illness from my fathers side.

&amp;#x200B;

Today it got worse we took her to the store and she slapped a young teen girls phone saying dont you ever film me delete that now who is spying on me. 

She also thinks our neighbors are spying on her when they are fixing their house and hammering outdoors she will go outside even 100 times in 30 minutes, one time she started throwing cans over the fence and bottles at night at our neighbors and I caught her she did it 2 am.

She used to go to those psychiatrist or hospitals but never tells them the truth, so they couldn't diagnose her she will lie and say she is just depressed or sad, or that someone yelled at her she never tells them she hallucinates, hears voices or thinks people are spying and filming her

one time my sister tried to catch her in the act and film her so we could show the psychiatrist that she has paranoid schizophrenia so she could get help and medication but she yelled super loud and chased my sister and demanded she stop and delete the video, it was a video of her going in our yard climbing a ladder to spy on our neighbors.

Our father is old and still alert and sharp and he controls everything he tries to shame us and say if something happens to your sister it is your fault, if they give her meds and she dies its on your hands, he tries to guilt trip us he did this for the past 20 years and he said its against the law to put someone in a mental health clinic he will make things up. He said you have no money they will charge you 50 thousand to keep her in a therapy.etc

WE never had any solid social life because when we were younger our sister would spy on us, all my girlfriends got scared off because of her, she would find their number and tell them are you spying on me and they said they couldn't be with me anymore cause of my crazy sister the worst one is when I was engaged I never took my girlfriend t meet my family because of my crazy sister and father, she finally met my family and I told my mom not to break my sister because I was scared she would act up and she did, she gave my fiance a dirty look and then later a month later she called my fiance cell phone and said die you B and whore and all these things saying she was spying on her.

Her parents told her to leave me because if we had kids our kids would have mental illness like my sister. 

Today was bad when she yelled at some woman saying do you know so and so and tell her to stop filming me and spying on me.

223,"So, my girlfriend has several emotional/mental disorders (most intense being bipolar disorder and OCD) that tend to put her through severely negative mood swings. She'll often say she feels hopeless about our future, that she thinks these feelings will never change even if her environment does (she comes from an abusive, somewhat physically and very emotionally, household. We're planning to have her move in with me), and that she cant stop thinking of mutilating her body. I know she's in control of herself enough to not act upon these urges, and I don't think that this is an urgent issue or anything. She's always had these problems, and her grip on them has been improving tremendously since we've started giving her emotional health and environment the attention and care it needs. We're working on getting her a therapist, who will obviously be better suited than me to support her in this regard, I'm just not sure what can be done to combat these mood swings right now, if anything. It's difficult hearing her say she feels like everything we're working for won't be for anything, even if I know that it's not and that she's only feeling that way in the moment. 
If anybody has some advice on combatting severe mood swings, please share. I know these things can be very different for different people, and the last thing I want to do is use the wrong approach to support her with something this severe, but.

I talked to my psych, and basically she is going to be looking into getting me on a liquid form of one of the psych meds so I can take it more easily. I have stomach issues and pills don't agree with me for the most part. I only take the pill for my stomach issue (irony?) and Tylenol, only if I am dying and can't stand whatever pain I am having. So yay for being able to take my meds.

Otherwise, the rest of my post was stupid and pointless. The psych admitted that Pyromania was actually in my charts, something I had been wondering about for a while now. Well, found out there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever as to what my diagnosis is. I feel both relieved (I know and have known what it is for a while now but hearing it from a professional helped) and extremely sad. Never in 10000000000000000000 years would I have guessed that at 49 years old I would be in a group of people that is very very small. This is so misunderstood, hard to treat (therapy and meds yeah, but they are not proven at all to be effective and the person needs to WANT to change, which I do not), and just not acceptable to society because of the inherent danger involved.

ne drone on and on about shit that I really didn't give two fucks about. I feel so annoyed and agitated now and I don't know why. The people in my Program hadn't done anything wrong. I am just in a shit mood, I guess. I need to burn something but guess what...that is an UNHEALTHY COPING MECHANISM...for fuck's sake...it is the only thing that truly makes me feel better.

I do not have the classic symptoms of a panic attack , instead I fully disassociate and derealize . Being at work is EXTREMELY difficult even though my job isn't demanding and I spend 9 hours a day alone. Atleast once a week I get home from work and have a breakdown because it's too much.  I feel like im losing hope that things will get better , in fact they just keep getting worse . When I turned 19 I started experiencing hypomanic episodes . My primary care doctor believes I am bipolar and was diagnosed incorrectly at such a young age because I am now at the point where mania manifests . I have been trying to find a psychiatrist (Illinois state insurance makes it difficult) , and every counselor i have seen does not help. I can barely get myself out of the house and cannot afford to do text/call counseling even though that would work so much better for me. When I am at home working my side job (I do Scentsy) , I feel ok. I have tried so many coping mechanisms and NOTHING works.

227,"Does anyone know of any resources I can use for therapy? I’ve been trying to seek a therapist through my insurance but sadly the only options are for those who a chronically suicidal. I am not suicidal, rather I fear the prolonged effects of me not addressing the night terrors, panics, and mental unresponsiveness that I have been experiencing lately. I had some trauma as a kid with my mother being abusive and my father being distant and out of reach when I needed help and at the time it hurt but I didn’t really have any severe mental issues but since moving out and being on my own constantly, I’ve grown back into having night terrors (I had them very frequently as a child) and panic attacks. Whenever I seek help, I am told no because I am not suicidal and I cannot afford to pay 75-150 per hour for a session, so I’m really in a jam with this. I have been told by the screening psychiatrist that I may have ptsd and that I appear to be on the spectrum for catatonic schizophrenia.

237,"I'm so upset with myself right now and I need to let it out.

I have been a procrastinator my whole life. It's really screwed me over. I'm in my mid-twenties now and I'm still suffering from mental health issues but I've pushed off seeing a psychologist and a psychiatrist because, as mentioned above, I procrastinate for everything in my life.

Recently, my mother had enough and called a psychologist for me and told me I had to go. I was furious. After sitting for a while though, I realized I wasn't mad at her, I was mad at myself for not making the call I **knew** I had to make. I was (still am) mad at myself for being so dependent at my age. My friends are married and I have to have mommy call the doctors for me.

That was around two months ago. Since then, me and my therapist have made some great strides in getting my life on track. We came to the conclusion that I need to see a psychiatrist. I've always known I have untreated ADD. My parents are foreigners who are against any medication unless it's life threatening so I never got treated for it, making me suffer through my whole schooling experience. He also said I am showing signs of depression. He said the D word. That's taboo in my culture. Medication is a bigger taboo. We discussed and decided that my life can only get better than what it is now, so I might as well do it. My therapist says it will help me a lot! I'm kind of excited at the prospect of not being as miserable as I am now.

After being told that, what do you think I did??? I procrastinated **AGAIN!!!** Why? Because screw me that's why. 

After waiting ages and enlisting my older brother to be on top of me, I finally make the call. The next appointment they have available is in a month and a half. Awesome! Finally on my way to fixing my issues.

My appointment was yesterday in the morning at 9:30. I have an alarm for 7:30 that I use for work. I wake up and realize that I woke up *way too early* for my appointment and go back to sleep. I wake up an hour later. The doctor is 17 minutes away from my house. That means I have to leave the house by 9:10 and I should be fine. Decide for some reason to take a shower even though I already took a shower the night before. The crap+shower lasts until 9:00. Since I didn't prepare (see above where I said I procrastinate) I had to search for my insurance card to make sure I bring it. That's until 9:15. Finally get to the doctors office around 9:26 and I need to park. Their parking lot charges **$30:00** for freaking parking. My cheap a$$ says hell no and look for parking around the area. I finally find parking at 9:45. I call my doctor on my way to the office RUNNING. 

It's too late. 

They wont see me. 

I have to reschedule for an appointment in a month from now. I have to wait another month.

Why did I have to wake up too late. Why did I have to take forever to get ready even though I knew I was in a rush? I was at the finish line, why did I have to shoot myself in the leg?? Why am I like this? Why do I do this to myself?

238,"Hi this is my first post here I’m writing on mobile so I apologize if the format isn’t great.
I (21F) recently stopped smoking weed after using it to cope with depression for 2 and a half years of almost everyday use. I have been trying to come up with healthy coping and distractions as the fall is coming and I usually fall into seasonal depression also due to some hard memories that took place in the Fall and Winter. 
I have nothing against weed smokers or anyone who uses it everyday whether it’s for coping or just recreational fun. For me though, I quit after a few really paranoid highs that I had. I never had those feelings before until probably July this year and I haven’t smoked since the beginning of August probably. I tried smaller amounts here and there and in different surroundings but it really just doesn’t do what it used to do to help me. I’ve spoken with my therapist and she has recommended a medical card so that I may find a strain that is perfect for me and I do believe that’s possible, but for right now because I quit after doing it nonstop for 2+ years, I don’t think getting that perfect strain and continuing is in my best interest at the moment. 
Fall is kind of hard for me. September kicks it off by having the birthday’s of two of my friends who passed away too young. One (E) was due to a situation influenced by alcohol, and one (B) was actually an overdose on fentanyl. B actually also overdosed on christmas eve two years ago, and I got the call while I was at work, it absolutely destroyed me as I had reconnected with him one month prior after we didn’t get along for almost 3 years. The last thing he ever said to me was that he had to hurry and leave because he needed to go meet his dealer. The place I worked also matters because I was working in the same place, same room when I got the call that my grandmother had passed away. To me it all just connects. September is also the anniversary of my friend’s family member who died in a tragic accident also way too young. This year I received a hoodie for him, but it still fucks with me because I drive the road he died on every single day to get to work. 
Right now my mom is having health issues, and my other grandma is in the hospital with horrible cancer. I also have outside influences bothering me such as a family member’s ex girlfriend who has been harassing my family for months, as well as someone who did something really awful to me who got a court ordered protective order on me when I spoke out about it. Fall is also one of the hardest times because I used to work for 2 different haunted houses when I was younger, one of these was protecting a pedophile who assaulted multiple friends I had. Seeing these come up in my social media memories with photos of him before we knew absolutely sucks. The cold air reminds me of standing around the bonfire with all of these shitty people at the haunted house, and how I wish I would’ve never even gone there. These things really have had an impact on me and I’m trying so hard to not let them into my mind as I have acknowledged the deaths, and the court situation and have done my best to accept what has happened and moved on. I have an amazing fiancé but she works 5 days a week until night time most days. I also have two cats who I love every much. I am not suicidal and don’t have thoughts of hurting myself, It’s more so that when I get home after working all day, I often find myself laying on my couch thinking about these things. 
 
I am looking for some new hobby ideas, possibly some funny movies or shows to watch. Ideas of how to distract myself from these bad memories and feelings. I’ve been spending time watching Avatar the Last Airbender but finished it, and I’m about to finish the Legend of Korra so I’d love some ideas for similar shows or movies as those make me really happy. I also really enjoy video games, I play Skyrim and the Sims 4 a lot while my cats cuddle next to me. I think I’m really just trying to (pre)prepare myself for the feelings that come back this time of year every year. And with Covid, it’s hard to go be around my friends and go out and do things. If you guys have some ideas or advice for me that would be so helpful. 

TL;DR I’m worried that my seasonal depression is going to come back very bad this year due to past memories and traumas and want advice and ideas on how to distract myself and cope. 

Thank you guys in advance ❤️",17Sep2020,1
239,"i’ve been psychiatrically disabled since childhood (legally designated on entering adulthood). all signs point to the likelihood that my life will continue to like this, as i have had the same basic set of symptoms increasing in severity with every successive year since the age of 5. i also am diagnosed with BPD, which rolls together into my anorexia/bulimia diagnoses, and those two set the stage for the panic attacks and dissociation to get really bad, which then sets up self-harming behaviors (cutting, hitting, burning, etc.) just so i can feel anything. after that whole roughly-linear cycle has occurred once, i usually have a resulting depressive episode, replete with loaded-gun-in-mouth suicidal gestures (though they may fall more under the category of rehearsals, as the majority of the time they occurred i would not let anyone know after.) which then sends me back into hopelessness, thereby starting the cycle over again. in addition to that whole thing, i also don’t leave the house for fear of being assaulted again. aside from being severely mentally ill, i’m transgender (MtF, and let me tell you what a joy that’s been...) 

a couple of years ago, i was physically assaulted in an experience which everyone to whom i’ve described it has reflected back to me was a hate crime (i didn’t report it to the police or anyone. i went home and sobbed, it literally didn’t even occur to me that i should report it.) PTSD dx with the other things.

also diagnosed with TBI from the literally dozens of concussions i’ve given myself over the years, because while i’ve been beaten up (and also raped by a former partner) due to being queer and physically not intimidating, i have somewhat ironically never thrown a punch or hit anyone. except myself, i’m the only one who’s not off-limits. i’m the only safe target, both ethically and practically.

everything is just too hard. my life looks like a hole. reading is too hard. playing video games is too hard, let alone doing the more challenging things that i really used to enjoy like hiking and playing music. eating hurts, like it causes my stomach severe, 8 or 9 out of 10 pain. to the point it has made me pass out or have consciousness fade more than once. from things like salads, or simple sandwiches or rice bowls. literally anything. restricting and bingeing and purging ruined my stomach. it’s hard to stay above underweight and all my efforts to do so result in the aforementioned type of pain.

i don’t really believe i’m justified at all in wanting to die. but everything hurts emotionally all the time to a level that feels constantly unbearable and impossible to ignore. it has for almost 25 years — i’ll be 30 next June. it’s prevented me from having almost any kind of a life at all.

it was always hard but since the assault it’s just become impossible. i’m unable to work or participate in life (i’ve volunteered quite a bit in the past with some organizations that helped drug addicts/alcoholics and also briefly with some that specialized in recycling building supplies, and that type of work is literally the best thing for me. but since two years ago, my symptoms have become too severe and i run the risk of having a full on panic attack or psychotic episode in public.) i can usually bring myself to at least play video games in the first half of the day, but the constantly swirling thoughts of needing to die just get exhausting. usually at this point i’m in bed crying or just dissociated much of the day. smoking a lot of weed, cigarettes. half hoping the smoking gives me a blood clot due to the estrogen so i can just be spared having to struggle with the decision.

tried getting professional help this summer. went to a treatment center for eating disorders and dual-diagnosis mental health issues. they assured me they were super trans friendly and my pronouns wouldn’t be a problem. turned out i was misgendered a dozen times by their staff in the first three days. it was fairly traumatic, considering the main thing driving my self-destructive compulsions at this point is the fact that i *don’t* pass well and that i was targeted for physical violence specifically because i’ve had such a difficult time transitioning — i started late even though i knew before i was even in 1st grade. (did i mention my mom literally laughed in my face and said “no you’re not!” when i told her i was bisexual as a 12 year old? or that my mom and dad kicked me out of the house with 4 hours’ notice when i told them i couldn’t suppress my need to transition anymore?) i don’t pass because my parents are bigots. i was socialized as a male and all the signs of being trans as early as age 3-4, like wearing my mom’s dresses, all got ignored. instead of being helped with transitioning or at least accepted for who i was, i was literally sent to a Freudian, queer-hating therapist who explained to me in front of my parents that my interest in wearing women’s clothing made me a fetishist and a pervert. some trans kids get supportive parents. some of us get... whatever the fuck you’d call what i experienced. i couldn’t even accept that i was trans until i was 26, and i didn’t start E until 27. and then i stopped because 9 months into it a guy came up to me while i was waiting at the bus stop with my groceries and pulled a Clockwork Orange on me, complete with terrifying “are you
scared?” before he started beating the shit out of me.

i honestly just want out. i called the mental health hotline in my area a bunch of times. told them i was basically practicing to kill myself with my gun. they said that because i didn’t have a plan, i wouldn’t qualify for admittance. which... like... i literally don’t even know what to say to that. maybe just fuck Oregon’s healthcare system. i had the dang thing in my mouth again last night. and don’t think it’s the gun — before i got a gun, it was nooses. cutting my arm open. driving my car head-on into a tree going 65. taking 40 xanax. every time i miraculously survived. like... the paramedics at the crash site said they’d never seen a crash that bad without blood everywhere. i walked away with a simple ankle fracture and some cuts and bruises. so i finally said “fuck it, next time i’d really like it to work” and got the gun. #america.

i’m actually not committed to suicide. it may sound like it just because i’m forced to live with these thoughts so many hours every single day. but I actually gave the trigger lock keys to my partner last night. i’m really trying to be responsible. that’s why i tried getting help. just... the help didn’t help. nothing has helped, and i’ve tried everything short of ECT (which has been recommended to me several times over the years.)

242,"I don't know how to explain this, but I'm sure I'm not the only one who feels this way.
I haven't been able to attend normal classes regularly since the start of high school (2016?).
I've always studied by myself at home as my school allows me to do so with my psychiatrist's diagnosis/certificate (idk, I'm not a native English speaker and I can't think straight right now).
Tbh I don't feel like I'm privileged, and that's totally fine with as I would hate to be more special than my classmates. But I do feel like I get treated unfairly by some of my teachers sometimes... For example, I got a bad grade by my Literature teacher even though I had studied really really hard for that exam. Of course, I didn't expect a 10/10 or anything like that, really.. But a 5/10 was just unfair imo, as my teacher had given the same grade to another student in the past who had completely frozen up during an oral exam, and refused to answer any questions about the test. But I digress...
I can't attend online classes, physically and emotionally. It's too much. Every time I think about it, I get nauseous, my heart rate becomes fast, my throat tightens up and it feels like I can't breathe.
I haven't attended one single online class yet and I can't picture myself doing it as the thought makes me want to hurt myself.
And when I try to picture it, I can only compare the feeling to claustrophobia.
I feel trapped within the four walls of my room, and I can't move. I can't escape. It's dark and cold. I'm lonely but not alone. Everybody is judging me.

So I’ll admit, right off the bat, I shouldn’t have been snooping on his phone. And I wouldn’t say I was snooping, but I guess it qualifies as that. Im not going into details, but he said something was possible that I firmly believe is not. I didn’t know where my phone was, so I grabbed his, knowing the password, and Safari was already open. Are you openly acknowledge this is wrong. However, I do also know that, without this snooping, my family would not have discovered what I found. In the search bar, he had typed Are you openly acknowledge this is wrong. However, I do also know that, without this snooping, my family would not have discovered what I found. In the search bar, he had typed “I want to kill my sister.” Naturally, I was immediately alarmed and confronted him. He made something up about it being related to a meeting, so I asked him to show me. He scrolled for a good while and gave me some unrelated white chicks meme. I saw right through it, and ask him to give it to me straight. He immediately started hyperventilating in saying he has depression. I myself suffer from depression and anxiety among other things, and my family has never seen nor heard about this or any signs of this. This was all a lot to take in a very short amount of time. I didn’t react well. My parents are currently mad at me for reacting antagonistically. I’ll admit, I got carried away and jumped the gun, saying things like how I don’t feel safe in the house. I have some very disturbing intrusive thoughts, but I’ve never dealt with anything like this. This is very out of the blue.

Right now, I don’t know what to do. I openly see a therapist, and mental health isn’t taboo at all in my home. My mom used to be a therapist. I recognize now I’m probably not in danger. He’s a little bit of an odd kid. He’s very much into theater, has mostly female friends, and keeps to himself in the house, mostly playing computer games.

Nobody asks for my company and I constantly feel like I'm forcing them to do things when I ask for theirs. I just want someone to be excited for my presence. I want to not feel like I'm constantly bugging people and begging them to interact with me.",17Sep2020,1
253,"Has anyone ever just taken buspar for anxiety? I'm currently on 7.5 mg of buspar, twice a day with 150 mg of wellbutrin. Buspar was added to the Wellbutrin a couple weeks ago. I've been on Wellbutrin for a month and a half and my anxiety is at an all time high. I keep hoping it will get better, but it hasn't seemed to. I've read that Wellbutrin can increase anxiety so my thought was getting rid of the Wellbutrin and staying on Buspar? I didnt really feel depressed when I started wellbutrin- just anxious about literally everything. I might switch back to Zoloft even though it absolutely kills my sex drive, but if it helps me feel better -- it seems like an appropriate trade off. Will I need to taper off Wellbutrin since I've only been on it for a month and a half?  Thanks for the help!",17Sep2020,1
254,"So I’ve always had issues with anxiety and depression ever since I was a kid. I tried medicine(busprar) for awhile but was not a fan so I’ve basically just kind of been dealing with the random mood swings that pop up when things get real hard.

It seems to have gotten quite a bit worse with the birth of my son around 2 years ago... stuff that would stress me out before on maybe a 3/10 is now almost always a 10/10... and lately it seems like I’m having very rough days just out of the blue...

Out of the blue as in I’ll got days without feeling this way then one day I’ll just be fixated on it. The worst part about all of this is I feel like I have absolutely nowhere to turn to with these thoughts and feelings because my wife has a lot of stuff going on... my dads brother killed himself, I don’t want to worry my mom, and I can’t post in one of these reddit or Facebook groups without worrying if someone is gonna report my stuff and end with a wellness check or something.

I just need to vent bro’s, shit has been feeling really rocky lately and I don’t know how to stop feeling this way, driving me insane.",17Sep2020,1
255,"Can you share your experiences about an emotional support dog (dog only, not other animals) for depression or anxiety? How exactly did it help you? Or did it not help you? I want to understand and make an informed decision and could use some bullshit-free feedback. TIA.",17Sep2020,1
257,"I will first point that I am incredibly young. I am only 21 years old, and while I have had stressful, demanding roles prior to where I am now, this one is the hardest to manage. I joined the United States Air Force 3 years ago, right before I turned 19 years old. When I was still underage, I was caught drinking and was immediately disciplined. I was told it would not ruin my career, and so far it looks like they were telling me the truth, however I am not exactly going to roll the dice and find out the hard way that I was wrong. For context's sake I will elaborate about. In my line of work, you test every couple of years for the next rank, following your performance report. Your performance report can obviously weight you very heavily upward, or downward. I working the hardest I possibly can, I am grinding for an upward pointing performance report, and then I am going to study like my life depends on it. It is safe to say I want this, however I feel like that I spend so much time just trying to manage my time that I cannot enjoy the little downtime I get at night, it feels like the whole purpose is defeated, and it is driving me mad.",17Sep2020,1
260,"I don’t think I’m alone in this, but my mental health has been slipping more and more recently. I find myself feeling anxious, depressed, and constantly worried. Especially around the election and what the coming months in this country might be like. 
So what tips do you have for maintaining mental health while also being an informed citizen?",17Sep2020,1

262,"I (19F) recently started Mirtazapine 15mg and they’ve been doing their thing, side effects mostly.

They’re a black box prescription, so I’m not at all surprised the side effects have come on. I mentally don’t feel better in any way, they’ve made me resent being alive at all. I feel like I’m gaining weight to my already full-figure, which has made me feel more disgusting. I also get frustrated when my family does so much as have conversations with me.

I live with my mom, her BD, and my two younger siblings. I’m unable to move out for both financial and mental health reasons, and that thought makes me feel worse about myself. I feel stupid for not having a job anymore. I can’t mentally bring myself to acquire one due to the pandemic in fear that I will spread it to others. I know I can’t really control those concerns I have, but my oldest younger sibling (13M) picks me apart for it, making fun of my mental illnesses daily. It deteriorates my mood for the day and makes me feel terrible. My mother’s only advice is “Just ignore it and don’t bring it up”. I very seldom talk about it, and other times, he just somehow suddenly makes it the main topic of any random conversation. I also can’t just ignore it as it’s been ingrained in my mind that I’m worthless for it.

My antidepressants make me scream inside when any of this happens. I just want to run away and die. I can’t take being around my mother anymore, either. Being an adult living with a parent is easier said than done, and I learned that immediately when I turned 18, even though it was definitely difficult before that. I don’t have my father or any father figure in my life, so moving in with one is out of the question.

I gained 100lbs since I dropped out of high school in 2017 due to heavy depression and am haunted by it. I can’t go in public, not even to the grocery store. I have fears that old classmates will see me and how much weight I’ve gained and just forever now view me that way. I was quite small in high school.

Idk, kinda random and all over the place, but I just feel like shit. I have a therapist and psychiatrist, so they know how regular this is for me, but it’s hitting pretty hard today.",17Sep2020,1
263,"&gt;We define toxic positivity as the excessive and ineffective overgeneralization of a happy, optimistic state across all situations. The process of toxic positivity results in the denial, minimization, and invalidation of the authentic human emotional experience.\*

It's so easy to feel like you have a problem or you're broken or you're doing something wrong when you're not happy. Like it's your fault and it's not ok. Learning about the concept of toxic positivity helped a bit, but this interaction I heard just sort of blew my mind wide open:

Somebody asked a singer I like how he ""finds time to be happy when he's constantly singing songs that need so much sad emotion."" This was his answer:

“I’m not very happy to be honest with you, but I think that happiness is this destination that we’re taught is so important. I think that happiness is great, and is nice and it’s good to have moments of happiness and joy. **\[But\] I think the constant pursuit of happiness teaches us that when you’re not happy, you’re wrong, and you’re not wrong, you’re just alive.**”

It didn't solve my problems or make my depression go away, but it did make me feel a little bit better. Sometimes (often) I'm not happy, and that's ok.
