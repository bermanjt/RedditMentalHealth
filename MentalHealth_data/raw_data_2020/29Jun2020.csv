0,"I've struggled with depression for years. I've been through some of the worst of it, suicide attempts, calling in to work because I literally cant get out of bed, etc. I'm very fortunate to have a family that cares a lot about me and helped me along the way, and helped me seek treatment. I'm very happy, and honestly proud to say that my depression is all but completely managed. I no longer have suicidal thoughts, or really even ideations, I rarely get depressed anymore, and I'm overall happier. I had been depressed for so long that I had gotten used to it, depression became somewhat of a comfort zone, I almost didn't want to get better because I always got worse. Now that I've been in therapy for several years, and I'm on steady medication that works for me, I realize how bad my day to day life was. The pain, the apathy, the self-hatred, all of it to the point that I just wanted to die. I know what my friend must be going through. It pains me to know that he is hurting so bad, and I'm scared that he'll take his own life. He confessed that he almost went through with it once, and it scared me more than almost anything anything else in my entire life. I've encouraged him to seek treatment, and I've offered my shoulder to sulk on. He seems grateful that I care, but determined to go through it all on his own. He's so afraid of being as much of a burden on anyone else as he is on himself, and as much as I reassure him that he could never be a burden to me, he still doesn't come to me. He also expresses a serious contempt for treatment. He hates the idea of therapy, though he's been forced to attend sessions by his school. He refuses to let it help him. He hates medication, too. ""If I'm not depressed, is it really me?"" ""Of course it is. Your depression does not define you. And I'll love you no matter what."" He says he's dealt with it for this long, why should he do anything now? He says he doesn't even want to get better, maybe even that he doesn't believe it's possible for him. I assure him things can get better, but it has no effect. I share anecdotes and do my best to show him I care and encourage him to talk, but it's always to no avail. I will not try to force him to do anything he doesn't want to do, and I've told him I will support him no matter what. While his attitude can be discouraging, I refuse to give up on him. I will always support him, and I plan on continuing to advise him to seek treatment. It's been nice to vent, but I ultimately came here for advice. Can anyone help me help him? Is anyone going through something similar? I'm a little lost, and while I know treatment doesn't work the same for everyone, I want him to at least try. I want him to know the same happiness I know, or at least try to.",29Jun2020,1
1,"My bike was stolen from work a few days ago. Id kept it in the back in a boiler room behind 2 security doors so you'd have thought it would be safe but nope. 4 years of hard work and £3000 down the drain. I'm a student as well and it's looking like insurance won't pay out so I'm guessing I'm not getting anything back for the money I've paid for that either. Honestly so done with everything. I've lost my best friend, the thing there for me at my lowest points and helped me achieve some of the greatest things I've ever done. Cycling was a mental therepy for me. The loss of that and something incredibly dear to me has left me stretched mentally and I'm not really sure where I am anymore. Just done basically with humanity. F*ck trying to do anything to  help myself mentally or do anything I enjoy clearly the world just wants to take it away. The only consolation is he's in custody now so maybe I'll still see it he can't have sold it in 2 days.",29Jun2020,1
2,"So lately I've been struggling a lot with my depression and my suicidal ideations have been getting worse, I'm currently living in South Australia and I'm honestly considering turning myself in to hospital because I don't feel safe in my own mind. 

I've struggled a lot with finding coping mechanisms and honestly, my phone's been great for distracting myself from life, which is why I'm worried because if I go to hospital, would they take my phone and maybe even go through it for my own security or whatever? I'm sorry if this is a stupid question but I'm just paranoid of getting it taken away and what they might find, even though I don't have anything bad, my brain just goes ""but what if I do?"" 


Anyway, TL;DR I'm scared I'll get my phone taken away if I voluntarily hospitalize myself for mental health.",29Jun2020,2

6,"So I'm not sure how to explain this, as this is something even my therapist doesn't know about, but my best idea of it is that when my emotions and senses get overloaded, I'll just completely shut down, as in, I can't feel anything no matter what. I'll start crying and then my mind will just be blank. I can't say much about the specifics as my memory of these ""episodes"" is quite hazy, but the part that worries me is my homicidal ideation. I know I haven't done anything yet but a lack of clear emotion and homicidal thoughts is terrifying to think about. I'm just interested in your lots thoughts.

7,"I remembered something today. I feel that I need to share it with someone. I'm putting this together this based on my old diary.

This entry is exactly from 28th of March, 2018. I even wrote an hour and place. I don't why 17 year old me was doing that. Let me give some background first. 

Back then I lived with my mom who couple months before gave birth to my sister. Her father... I promised I wouldn't tell anyone why he had to leave. I will only metion that we were devastated. Mine was hour of driving away, back then our relationship was still weak.

Depression kicked me hard. To the point of bleeding. I hid in the changing room instead of going to the classroms. At first just for few first lessons. Later I missed every single one. My social life didn't exist. It’s not like I had friends. Classmates probably thought I prefer being alone (at the beginning of the year I actually wanted to befriend them - they the most normal, nicest class I had). Only one girl still talked to me. Friends from past school? After I moved none of them reached out.

Mom wasn't a good option for a talk either. She always tried her best and clearly loved me. But there were bad moments too. End of 2017 and 2018 all the way to May or June was hell. Her problems with screaming got ridiculous. I was scared. I could cry, she didn't stop. I asked myself: ""where is my mom?"". My sister was clingy and easy to wake up, so it made matters worse. Seriously. I woke her up by opening a juice box. Many times I heared them in the middle of the night. After leaving to dad's house so I could get some peace I had nightmares about it. One of them scared me so much I went back to sleep in his room.

I also had troubles because of gender dysphoria. This was one of this moments when was confused. I still had a thought in my head that maybe I'm a tomboy. It felt less and less right. Being older brother sounded better than sister. Bra's started to couse a lot of pain, not physical. Buying clothes from men's section brought me joy, wearing them comfort. I watched an episode of a show where hostess helped women pick a new look which reminded them that they are beautiful. In this one she lost her breasts because of cancer. I felt really bad for her... but I was also jealous. Realising this hurt. How can I be jealous of that? Sha was crying her eyes out. It became obvious very quickly. I wanted to have a flat chest. I wanted it so bad, I was wishing for an awfull dissease. God... 

Back to the entry.... 

I was in the bathroom. For some reason I put my back against cold wall and sank on the floor. I wandered - what will happened when I lose last ounce of strength? Will to keep going? What will I do? Find a way to disappear?

After the shower it got replaced by emptiness. I sat there, apathetic. I heared mom talking on the phone and my sister, but it was so distant. Like the only sound I was able to catch were droplets falling down. Everything seemed so huge for a moment. Tears were slowly wetting my cheeks. I stood up and immediately looking in the mirror. This wasn't me. I felt like I was watching someone else. A stranger. Like a random girl decided to stare at me. When I walked away this feeling was just gone. Emptiness again.

Weirdest part was that something else I felt randomly at some point. Like behind bathroom door was nothing aside from write void. I saw it in my head for a split second. Similar to fog, milky, without end, covering sigh completely and silencing any noise. No floor, walls, just white.

I felt like I lost something, a part of me. Like my problems didn't matter - they weren't reall (this how mom made me think, sadly). Like everything I enjoyed, was passionate about didn't bring any emotions. Nothing. Nothing was important. Even me. Mostly me.


NOTE: I'm going on therapy two years now. I'm doing better. I decided to put it in just in case someone got worried I'm still in this awfull state.",29Jun2020,1
8,"Hello, I have a panic disorder and have panic attacks on a regular basis. I’ve suffered from this for many many years and have been on Zoloft for about 13 years. I want to get my meds changed but due to lack of money and Covid I am kind of stuck. What meds are you on that work? Do you use benzos? Any natural or home remedies that you’ve found that work? Any advice would be great! I’d also like to share some things I’ve found helpful:

10,"The world, or existence rather, is just such a fucking horrible place. I feel overwhelmed and terrified by the sheer pain and irredeemability of it all. I never asked but I was born into this place that does nothing but give you hope and brief moments of joy but only on the condition that you know it will one day go and the pain of that will stay with you forever. I want to see my grandma again, I want to undo all the pain she lived in after grandad died. I want to see my ex again. I want to live in a universe where my amazing parents won't one day be dead, but I'm not, and I never will be.

It honestly feels like a nightmare, and the only reason we aren't all constantly freaking out about it is because we're not really thinking about it, we just placate ourselves until we're dead. There's no meaning or ascension, just born in the muck to die in the muck.",29Jun2020,3
11,"So I have episodes where I just become unable to feel emotions, which are always caused by my senses or emotions getting overloaded. I can't talk about specific events from my episodes, as my memory from them is hazy, and the episodes last hours or even the rest of the day. This is an issue but the part that really worries me is my homicidal ideation, as long periods of complete apathy and homicidal thoughts is a terrifying prospect to think about. Not sure what to do. Is this common? Is there treatment?

13,"Hello all,

I’ve entered some sort of spiral recently out of nowhere and I’m just really depressed and crying all the time. It’s hard to find a therapist nowadays I guess, I mean I have an appointment for next Tuesday, but I really need help now.
I’m getting really tired of just feeling shitty for no reason and crying out of absolutely nowhere. My boyfriend is annoyed too and he’s not really helping much, he’s kind of making it worse and either doesn’t listen or rolls his eyes and tells me  to get help even though I ask for his love and support.
Since that’s clearly not helping, I’ve come here. I’m just really lost and tired of feeling this way, I really don’t know what to do. It feels like it’s endless and I really don’t want to do anything that I'd regret.
I’d be so grateful if someone would be so kind to listen and talk things out or even give some advice, I’m really struggling with my mind here.

Thank you❤️",29Jun2020,1
15,"My gf (20) struggles a lot with depression and somewhat with anxiety. Like most people, she goes through phases of it being worse and then it gets better. We've been together for about a year and a half and have both noticed that she also develops obsessions when the depression lessens. Whether it be with her uni work or a tv show, she becomes so emotionally attached to things to the point where she will think about a character's death for days. 

It doesnt bring up any issues in our relationship at all, and as far as I'm aware it doesn't stop her going about her daily activities. She explained that she feels she may be bipolar because her highs are so energetically high and her lows are often suicidal, but she doesn't want to self-diognose.

I'm curious if anyone else experiences these obsessive interests, and if they coincide with their mental health. I love her so much and want to familiarise myself with what she copes with as best I can.

Thanks for reading and for any suggestions :)",29Jun2020,1
16,"Hey guys so for the past few weeks I've been going through a serious episode of some form of mental breakdown and I have noticed that whenever I get into a certian headspace my pupils become extremely dilated, like 80% - 90% of my iris sized big. I was also looking in the mirror and noticed they like, rapidly fluctuate, like really rapidly, like bounce up and down about 2mm in like 2 seconds. 

What does this mean. Like i said, I'm going through a serious psychotic episode atm and I'm paranoid bc I think im possessed and massive pupil dilation is a symptom of that (before anyone tells me thats ridiculous, i know).

Does anyone have a scientific reason as to why they could be so large sometimes? Also, they do get a bit smaller when I open my phone camera and focus on them. 

Also also, when they are dialted I also have a strange, tickly sensation on the top-back-right side of my head, the two seem to be correlated so I thought I'd add that for extra detail idk.

(I am not on any medication or drugs of any kind)

Edit: I did a little bit a research and actually found out the part of my brain that feels wierd is actually the part of the brain that is responsible for interpreting certain stimuli, including some visual stimuli, this is interesting because one of my pupils is more dialted than the other snd this seems to correlate to the wierd feeling I get in that part of my brain. Idk why I put this hear, its just kinda interesting.",29Jun2020,1

19,"For context, I have generalized anxiety disorder and have had a history of panic attacks. My mind is usually racing every day at all times of the day. I am a gay 21 yr male with the childhood trauma I guess of growing up gay and being bullied for it.

I have been trying to practice mindfulness of catching my thoughts and rewiring them. I've been trying to dissolve habits of self criticism, pity, and general uneasiness. Basically, any hard wired thinking I've picked up from child hood into my current adultness.

The byproduct of my anxiety is hyper vigilance of both myself and others around me. Therefore *I think I know myself* or rather intellectualize myself.

My thinking process of overthinking is linked to me not lying to myself. I think that if I think everything over and over I am being vigilant of myself and clinging onto a ""truth"" that most people overlook (as I analyze how people interact). I believe this to be a defense mechanism to avoid being hurt by people.

For example when I am in conversation with another person it usually isn't me in the convo like I try to pay attention but I am usually ""meta aware"" of my own actions ( my tone of voice and where my hands should be placed or how I am standing) instead of what is actually being said by the other person.

Yet when I focus on my breathing, I feel like I am on autopilot and the ""in the present"" version isn't actually me. Or is that again what I just *think* myself to be? (either always anxious or on autopilot)

When I practice mindful behavior I find myself to be more charismatic and social. But I am consciously *trying* to be mindful. Like it does not feel organic when compared to my regular anxious thinking patterns.

For example, I'd have a intrusive thought and think ""everyone is staring at me, omg"" but then quickly try to rethink the situation and think something like ""you aren't the only one struggling with insecurity"". This helps me ground myself and I feel better as I focus on my breathing and recenter to the present.

I find I am more social and just ""do"" things when I am in this mindful mode, hence this reddit post. Yet when I am in my ""normal"" cycle of self doubt, worry, overthinking I don't get anything done and feel bad about myself but this feels like the ""human"" me.

In the back of my mind I feel like I am letting a part of me dissolve and it makes me scared. Like I feel almost empty and numb when I practice this and I fear it could mess me up mentally.

I essentially fear mindfulness could split my personality.

Did I equate my overthinking with ""feeling like my self""?

Is this what people refer to as ""dissolving the self"" in Buddhist practices?

I am afraid of cracking up and not recognizing myself, if that makes sense.

Is this my ego being afraid? Does anyone have any insight to this? Thank you!",29Jun2020,1
20,"I recently conducted a survey of my teens in my area on Instagram.  (They had no idea who I was and I told all of them their answers were confidential.)  I asked one girl on how she felt  the barriers that conservative states place on teens seeking sexual contraception.

She then responded telling me about how she was once raped and ended up pregnant from it.  Keep in mind she had no clue who I was and she brought the serious matter of rape up herself, totally unprovoked by me.

I've talked to my therapist and psychiatrist about these things over and over and nothing ever fucking changes no matter how hard I try. It always ends with me feigning happiness and desperately trying to fill my time up with things that mean nothing to me in an attempt to feel something other than lust or anger. lately I haven't been filling my time up with much. just tending to my responsibilities and then sleeping the day away.

so back to the topic i used to refuse to take my meds but now as i can feel my mental health getting worse i asked my grandma (guardian) if i could take them again but shes been telling me that my ""depression and anxiety"" is gone.

28,"I don't know how to start this post nor if this is the right sub for it, but my anxiety has been getting worse over the past 3 weeks. What scares me the most is that I don't know what's causing it. How can I deal with this and help calm myself?

For most of my life, I had a normal amount of anxiety and I knew how to deal with it. I've been to a therapist before who helped me with it and I was able to get a hold of myself in a couple of minutes, but the anxiety I feel now is different somehow.
The past couple of days, it has gotten to the point where my mind is in a constant fight or flight mode even in calming situations(watching a show, alone in my room, eating, etc.). I know it is going to get worse because I am running on 8 hours of sleep from the past 3 days. 
When I noticed I wasn't getting good sleep, I told myself to start going to bed as soon as I felt tired which was usually around 9. Each time, I fell asleep at 1 am (I monitor my sleep with a watch) and I wake up every hour until I finally wake up at 4 thinking someone was trying to kill me in some way.
It has also taken a toll on my weight in the sense that an underweight male who used to weigh 110 lbs is now at 98 in just under a week.

I don't know if this is caused by my anxiety, but I feel like I just need to write the little things that have bothered me. My speech is becoming more difficult because I stumble much more than usual. I notice I am more irate towards people, even my family. At work where I am known for being cheerful and kind towards customers, I've recently been short with conversations because I have no motivation to talk to anyone. I also have been having a feeling, either before or after my attempt at sleeping, that someone is going to kill me.

I probably said more than I need to, but my anxiety is freaking me out too much at this point. I really just need some advice on what I could do moving forward. Any and all forms of advice/criticisms/lectures are welcome because I am willing to do anything to help myself. I will also answer any questions if there are any.",29Jun2020,1
29,"Her life has been rough. She lost her daughters when her new husband sexually abused them. She sided with the guy. Naturally the daughters cut contact. She has been living with him for over 10 years now.

She started getting very religious. It has intensified in teh past couple years. She claims Jesus speaks to her in her head. He has told her to fast, to stop paying bills and rely on faith. She barely sleeps.

Ive been with her when Jesus talks to her. She has a wide-eyed enraptured expression. 

We have tried to explain to her that Jesus would never  want her to do the things she has been doing.

She is in a very bad state right now. She has lost a lot of weight. She isnt sleeping.

She wont listen to us. Shes passed out, gotten sick, been very unreasonable.

We are wondering how to get her help. In my country you can call for emergency psychological help. They can be held in a psych ward for a couple days. We fear that she would just check herself out or flat out refuse to except help.

What can we do to help her mind? She needs help. She needs to repair and heal her mind.

31,"Hi, I am a mental health peer advocate and I’ve noticed many clients come in looking for a pill to make everything better. I just want to remind everyone that there is no magic pill. From my experience, medication only gets me to a stage where i am no longer severely depressed or manic and can take action. Once in a stage where I am stable, I can start focusing on self care, coping skills, communication skills, anger management, etc. Someone once told me that medication only helps 20% of the time and 80% is all skills to manage your life. This was something I needed to hear to better myself. Today, I live a life that I never thought was possible. I hope others with mental health illnesses can find the same peace that I feel today.

41,"Since I was a child, I would cry and scream over the littlest things, such as being singled out of the classroom in grade school for speech therapy purposes, or receiving a rude statement (even three and four year olds know how to defend themselves, so I feel ashamed having been like that!). Despite me maturing, I have not gotten any better when it comes to my delicate feelings. I'm a fifteen year old girl going into my sophomore year of high school, and still cry and sulk the whole day if I am scolded by my parents for the littlest things. I've never been able to defend myself against bullies, because my immediate response to their taunting would be to let the waterworks loose before I could think of any comeback, which bullies obviously enjoy. Sometimes I take things way too personally, and might feel attacked even if that is not the other person's intention. I even get anxious to make new friends for fear that they might be rude, or shun me out. 

I've always wished to have a thick skin, but I don't exactly know how to toughen up and face tricky situations in life with a poker face. What are your suggestions? I don't want to remain like this until adulthood and have fits over trivial matters. 

If you even suggest that I take medication for my extreme emotions, I swear I wouldn't mind it! I just need a solution (unfortunately, I come from a cultural background where utilizing meds for the sake of mental wellbeing is a huge taboo and shame, so that could be tricky!).",29Jun2020,1
42,"Was it the break up?
Was it Covid?
Was it taking my courses online?
I was happier before the whole Covid thing. I was going to school, I had a schedule. I had the best boyfriend in the world and it just went to shit from March to now. I can’t stop crying.",29Jun2020,3
43,"I’m struggling you guys. I’m off my meds. 

I divorced my ex wife about 4 and a half years ago and really struggled with my mental health for a time. My world was topsy turvy and I really struggled with depression and anxiety in the years following. 

Then I met my current love. We fell in love and have the most beautiful daughter I ever could have imagined. I did therapy and got a prescription that worked for me. 

We moved across country and I love my life with them. But I hate my job. It’s so stressful and since I’ve been off my meds this past month - I haven’t found a new doc since we made the move - I’ve been dreading work so much every day. 

I don’t know what to do. We need the money but I feel like it’s so taxing on my mental health. I need to find a better work life balance. 

I’ve been laying in bed for the past two hours with my two beautiful girls laying next to me - with my heart beating out of my chest dreading work tomorrow. 

Sorry for the rant. I needed to vent to someone. 
Sunday night anxiety is the worst 😢",29Jun2020,1
44,Every now and then I feel like texting a hotline but I’m worried that whoever I’m talking to will send police and I’ll be taken to the “psych ward” part of the hospital and forced to stay there for a while. I went to the hospital after I tried to kill myself; I got lucky because I didn’t have to spend the next 3 nights there. I be damned if I ever go back though. Fuck that! So do they send police?,29Jun2020,2
45,"For all the time i can remember,no matter what’s happened, I can’t cry, no matter what, i just feel like there’s a dam in my soul stoping me from releasing anything, i just end up feeling numb, &amp; kinda pent up &amp; empty at the same time?

I’ll have days where I’m fine, and days where I’ll have even less energy then usual &amp; have the overwhelming want for pain that i just end up curled up in bed or by my pc, just restraining myself in silence with my fingers dug into my arm...

The reason I’m writing this now, is because as of the 8/2/20,my bf broke up with me, and these mood swings have been getting worse &amp; more frequent, &amp; after i made my “peace”, i was told that he’s already with someone else, &amp; from what i can gather, it’s his old X, and now i just feel used,angry,&amp; like no one understands me.

I think the string keeping me from ripping chunks of my own arm out is my mom, not because she’s “great”, but because... ok lemme give an example, when i told her i wanted to die when i was younger, her first reaction after an entire night to ponder was “how could you do this, how do you think i would feel if i walked into your room to see you dead on the floor”, told my sister, and forgot about it 2 weeks later, like wtf.

Like,the trade off for the cathartic pain isn’t worth her nagging my ear off about why i have scabs across my arm.

It felt strangely nice to type this out,even though I was worried at first,so thanks if you’ve read this far.",29Jun2020,3
46,I’ve struggled with severe anxiety after childhood trauma and being stalked by an ex for upwards of a year. I’ve been in and out of therapy and I have a psychiatrist appointment this Tuesday. It’s focused on anxiety but as I’ve been told by my therapists I have symptoms of PTSD. Any tips for a first psychiatrist appointment would be helpful! I’m just not sure how to approach it,29Jun2020,1
49,"After the doctor told me to start taking antidepressants, everyone around me thought that meant I'd be perfectly fine immediately. And to be honest, I wanted to believe it too, so much so that I just faked that I was okay. I made the shittiest, most meaninglessly and annoying conversations with those people to pretend like I was better to make them happy.

I'm still trying to pull myself back together. It's been 3 months since I started taking my meds and even though it's done something, it feels like a worse outcome. I'm still trying to fumble my way back into a healthier state where I can focus and get things done. I'm only now getting back into a proper hygiene routine. Things are moving too fast and I'm too far behind. I'm a failure, I'm trying so hard not to be, but it's impossible to be enough.

But the worst part is that I don't care anymore. At least before I saw the doctor I felt something about myself. But now I just can't be bothered to care that my life is crumbling around me. I hate it so much. I just want to be happy.",29Jun2020,1
50,"Recently, I came to a conclusion that , I’m not a really good person. I’m really manipulative, gigantic ego , prideful , spiteful, narcissistic . But I do feel remorse, I do feel guilt so I guess I’m not a sociopath. Though I love to lie even if it doesn’t help at all , it just feel good . Also I’m really fake . My friends, they’re good people,we hang out pretty often and each time I talk to them , I smile, I make eye contact and everything like a normal person, but in my head I just want them to fuck off , I want to curse at them, same goes with almost every single one I talk to . The emotions in my face is the reverse of how I feel . So , how can I improve myself? Thank you all.",29Jun2020,3
51,"Without really gong into a very long detailed history, i've never worked in my life. Dropped out at the start of high school. Never had a real life friend past the age of 13.

I've become so isolated for so long that I am essentially a timid, no eye-contact making weirdo who doesn't talk. Sobbed when i tried to do a job interview for a volunteer position because when i was asked to talk about myself, i immediately started thinking and talking about the worst aspects of myself.

I need serious help getting on my feet for a variety of reasons. My depression goes much deeper than i ever thought. Are there any special therapists i can speak to who can help direct me into a more productive position in society? I really feel like a child who needs my hand held every step of the way or else i won't get anywhere. ADHD diagnosed as a child as well, so it's very hard for me to remain focused on what is important without external assistance.",29Jun2020,2
53,"I feel like I can’t do anything right. I’ve long had it in my mind that I am mentally retarded to some degree; fearing my stupidity will “flair up,” I often avoid social interactions and always make excuses for not doing anything involving even a minute level of skill (mini golfing, bowling for example). I’ve always been horrible at sports in gym class, and even chose to sacrifice most of my freshman year summer to complete a physical education graduation requirement in advance rather than bear another two semesters of being teased. I always seemed to be “the one who couldn’t do it.” I felt like my brain and hands just didn’t work properly. I am constantly getting embarrassed every time I am out because I do/say stupid things that show a lack of common sense and can even feel hated for it. I hate speaking to anyone and often have to repeat myself to others because I have trouble creating cohesive expressions eloquently or speaking loudly enough. I have always excelled in academics, was told by many teachers that I write well, and told by others that I learn abstract concepts quickly; none of this matters to me, however, when I can’t even be more than two steps outside of my house comfortably. I don’t know if this is all in my head, if something is genuinely wrong with me, or if lack of social immersion in my younger years is to blame. I feel horrible every time I “mess up,” even sometimes conjuring plans of suicide. I see other people my age enjoying their youth, talking to people, and having amazing experiences, while I am stuck in a prison of sorts. I am a high school junior, and would deeply appreciate advice or stories of shared sentiments.",29Jun2020,1

55,"hi there, my name is ollie - i'm a thirteen year old girl, and i have an issue. my entire life, i've gone through very obsessive phases. when i was young it was a certain kind of toy, a different movie franchise, a book series, wanting to be a youtuber. in more recent years it's been art, bts, houseplants, minimalism, and.. my eating disorder. but we'll get back to that last one. 

i understand that all children go through phases, but mine were always very extreme. they could last between a few weeks to several years, but during those periods i would dedicate all my time, energy, and everything i had to my current obsession. i become completely absorbed and infatuated with something to the point where it's all i can think about. that meant constantly making fake youtube videos where i narrated my own life, painting for eight hours straight, scrolling through shopkins online and dreaming of buying them. rinse and repeat. my entire world revolves around that one thing for months until slowly, it gets boring, and i transition to my next phase. 

depending on how long it lasts or how much it meant to me, those things can often find their way into deeper parts of me - often intertwining with and becoming parts of my identity or being the defining factor to certain years of my life. the closest thing i've found to describe it is 'tenacity syndrome', or at least the way it's portrayed in the video “we are looking for a person who has “tenacity syndrome.” (eng)” on youtube [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-Bi5mIw24s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-Bi5mIw24s). however, unlike the boy in the video, my obsessions don’t have an end goal. there’s never one specific thing i want to accomplish - this is good and bad, because that means i can’t be disappointed if i don’t reach my specific desires, but also, sometimes moving on from something, i can feel.. incomplete. like maybe it was just a huge waste of time, if i never progressed of improved then what was the point?

the way i view past obsessions varies - for less trivial things, like fairies and disney, i don't really feel much. i wonder why i splurged so much on merchandise, i question how i once cared so much about something so.. pointless. but with more significant ones, especially art, it's hard. art was the most important/longest extreme phase i've had thus far. for several years, i genuinely believed that one day i would become a professional artist, that that would be my future. but things didn't turn out how i thought they would, and now drawing is really hard for me. i give up way quicker, i get frustrated easier.  so although i can still draw, i had placed so much emotional attachment onto it, it's become very difficult to create things. when i first started, i wanted to draw cute anime style girls, and now when i try to do that again, it's painful. the things i'm capable of creating, while potentially impressive to my younger self, aren't what i wanted them to be. they don't meet my current or past expectations. my relationship with my old passion is way more complicated than it needs to be. i'd describe it like the way you view an old lover, one you never moved on from - you miss them constantly, you wish it could've worked out, every time you see something that reminds you of them, it makes you sad. you wish you could still be together. but you just cant.

there were many times where i'd obsess over two things at once - for example, when i liked bts and drawing, i would draw the members often. when i liked plants and minimalism, i began only buying plants that genuinely excited me, rather than getting anything i could afford just for the hell of it. but around november of 2019, i began having problems. i had fallen out of my previous phase, so life felt like it no longer had a purpose. usually, i would slowly transition between infatuations, but this time, i didn't know where to go next. i didn't know what to do with myself, and weekends were a nightmare - i remember laying on the floor and just waiting for the hours to pass by. i was desperate to cling to something new, to be productive, to do something, *anything.* 

around this time, something happened. my sister has always had lots of problems with school and our parents, and she finally reached her breaking point. she ran away from home, and despite coming back a day later, that caused lots of things to spiral out of control. she took some time off regular school to address her problems and get better. again, she's always had problems with our parents, but this time they were enhanced. almost every night i'd fall asleep to the sound of them arguing about anything and everything. random accusations with nothing to back them up being spat out and shouts of frustration and constantly complaining about one another and loud endless crying and my mother screaming ""i'm sick and tired of this shit. i'm done being a mom. i'm tired of you acting like this.""

for the first time in a very long time, i began to feel neglected. i have never particularly enjoyed the company of my parents either - i don't hate them like my sister, i just love being alone and independent more. i would love nothing more than to get a job and live alone in a studio apartment. i love being alone, i love being away from my parents. i love the feeling of solitude. so it was extremely weird when i began to want their affection. suddenly, i was ignored and pushed to the sidelines. i wasn't used to it - despite always wanting independence, when it was given to me without a choice, i didn’t want it anymore. any time i asked my mom for something, she’d say “not now. we’re already dealing with your sister, can you just cooperate for once?” any time my parents *did* talk to me, it was always “i can’t believe your sister did this. promise me you’ll never be like her.” they didn't have time for me anymore. i know i should've been mature and supported them, done the best i could to try to cause the least amount of trouble possible. but twelve year old me didn't know how to do that.

with everything building up - being desperate to find a new obsession, secretly wanting control or affection or just.. something for myself, i turned to dieting. all throughout my childhood, i’ve wanted to lose weight. i’ve almost always been technically underweight, but it was never enough for me. in fourth grade i had a relatively bad relationship with food. i wouldn’t call it an eating disorder just yet, but i began constantly worrying about my body. any time i saw someone, i would immediately compare their body to mine in my head. i learned about bmi and calories and began doing leg slimming exercises in my spare time. in fifth grade i just stopped caring, in sixth i started to worry again, and in seventh grade, so this past school year, it became a full blown disorder. 

i’d like to say it started off healthily. but to be honest, i don’t quite remember enough to be certain. it was right around winter break, so i had tons of spare time to burn. every single day over vacation i would spend hours working out - leg exercises, ab exercises, cardio, using the elliptical for 33 minutes right after. it became my new way to pass the time, i loved exercising and it was a great distraction. i don’t know how i was eating back then, but i remember swearing off ice cream, pizza, baked goods, etcetera. it didn’t turn out very well, i gave up and many nights were spent shoveling dozens of cookies down my throat, standing in front of the fridge and grabbing anything i could. but i allowed it. because after all, “i’m just hungry because i worked out.” 

school resumed quickly, and i hoped to continue working out at home. i lost the motivation, though, and i only followed my old routines once a week or so. i don’t know when it became an eating disorder, but it definitely did. my entire life was consumed by food and calories and weight and my body. every waking moment, my head was wrapped around how many hours i’d been fasting, how many months it would take to reach my goal weight, how much food i should eat that day. gradually, it got worse and worse. i began calculating how many calories were in the recipes my mom followed, i began weighting my food with a scale and making sure i only had x amount at a time. it didn’t really matter though, because every night i would just give up. i remember standing alone in the basement, freezer open, spooning scoop after scoop of ice cream into my mouth. not even wanting it, not even tasting it, just needing to eat *something.*

for the past 6-7 months, my world has been consumed by the number on the scale. i accepted early on that it was, in fact, an eating disorder, but that knowledge didn’t really affect anything. my illness had become such a massive part of my identity, a massive part of who i am as a person. my parents noticed things. when i had my annual doctor's checkup, i was pleased to find that over a year, i had grown an inch and lost a pound. despite the fact that i should have gained several instead. the doctors wouldn’t have thought much of it, but my mom told them about my behaviors and the way i handled food in front of them. they wanted me to come back and get weighted again in a month, but then the pandemic started and we couldn’t. i stopped thinking about it, assumed they would forget about me and deal with other, more important matters. 

but in the beginning of june, my parents and doctor (not sure how much was decided by who) decided to have me start seeing a nutritionist and a therapist. in other words, putting me through forced recovery. this was always my greatest fear - i’ve never liked dealing with professionals when it came to my mental health, our family had seen two previously due to household issues. once when i was much younger, in around second grade, (for unknown reasons, our dynamic wasn't even that bad back then. i think my parents felt like we weren't your 'perfect happy family' and they wanted to change that) and then again after my sister ran away. neither experiences were pleasant or really.. changed anything. in fact they sort of made our situations worse. 

secondly, i didn’t want to talk to anyone about this private part of my life. my eating disorder was like my little secret, something i could have and no one else could interfere with. the idea of exposing it to someone else, much less a stranger, was terrifying. it wasn’t too bad at first, i tried to hide as much as possible and act like i didn’t have a problem. even with the limited information i gave them, they still diagnosed me with anorexia nervosa. i don’t know what to do now. ever since i was officially diagnosed, my parents have been constantly telling me that i need to recover. that i need to eat more fat, that i need more protein, that what i’m eating isn’t enough, that ""binging is healthy"". that i need to get better. that they don’t want to enable me or have me taken away from them. that if i don’t try harder and gain enough weight, they’ll have to send me to a program. 

but i’m not ready to recover yet. i haven’t decided that i want this for myself - deep down i know that it’s better for me, but i just don’t want it right now. i wish i did and i wish i could get better, but.. i just can’t. i don’t want to yet. i want to continue my bullshit and stay where i currently am. i have to want to get better by choice, *i* have to want to get better for *myself*. but the only reason i want to recover right now is because i’m more scared of being sent away or being force fed. however, it’s become so much more than losing weight now. my illness has become the only part of me that’s active - who i was before no longer exists. i *am* my disorder. i’m aware of how messed up that sounds, but seriously. my illness takes up every single thought, every moment of my life. my eating disorder consumes my every part of me. without it i have nothing. i don’t have the motivation to do anything else, to pick up new hobbies, to try and find something else to do. 

my illness has become my obsessive phase, and i’ve never been forced out of one of my obsessions before. i don’t know how to cope with it. i only ever move on to a new one when something else becomes more interesting, when my current one is no longer exciting or i feel like there’s nothing left for me to do. but this is so much different. it’s penetrated through layers of me i didn’t even know my obsessions could reach, i didn’t know i could resonate this deeply with anything. i didn’t know that something like this could become the only thing i have. when i didn't have a phase to distract me, every single day felt empty. i would wake up, try to waste as much time as possible, and go to bed. rinse and repeat. my disorder fills that void. it's better to feel pain than emptiness. it's better to worry about something that doesn't matter than to feel nothing. 

i don’t know what to do with myself. i know that unless i move on to something new and get bored of my disorder, i’ll never get anywhere. but i just can’t. i’m not ready for that yet, nothing else interests me more than my illness. i no longer have that spark that i used to - the sudden urge to pour my heart and soul into creating, i no longer have the burning desire or passion to express myself, to dive deeper into a new hobby until it can become my new obsession, to learn more about something. i don’t want to recover yet, i can’t recover yet. i’m not ready to. i think another reason for this is the way i view life right now. i'm not suicidal - i don't want to kill myself, but i don't want to live either. sometimes i hope i'll get hit by a car, someone will jump me, i'll end up in some freak accident. i wouldn't mind dying, but i'm not gonna go out of my way to pursue death. i want to live to be an adult and live in my own apartment, but i don't wanna wait that long. i wanna survive long enough that i get the chance to live alone, but i don't wanna live long enough get old and wrinkly. i dont want to die but i dont want to live either. so why even bother recovering? what's the point anymore? so i can live an endless cycle of waiting for time to pass? so i can be bored and feel nothing until i graduate?

when art became increasingly difficult to deal with, i just stopped drawing. didn’t think about it, just forgot about it and didn't come back until i wanted to. but eating isn’t like that. i need to eat multiple times a day, i need to look at nutritional information because i have food allergies, i have to look at myself in the mirror during dance class and just in general. i have to be constantly reminded by my parents that i need to get better soon. i can’t just ignore it until i feel better about it, the way i could with all my other obsessions that ended on a bitter note. i wish i wanted to recover, but i don’t. i can’t. i want to cling to my disorder, because without it, i have nothing. 

does anyone know what to call my obsessive phases? how do i find the motivation to live and to get better? how do i get myself to find a new infatuation? and most importantly, what do i do with myself now?",29Jun2020,1
56,"Mental health is such an important part of who we are. I heard a quote a few years ago, that was “we go to the gym to take care of our bodies, so we should go to therapy to take care of our minds.” Since then, I’ve been going to therapy. Something I recently had experience with, is trying to get someone help that doesn’t want it. Recently a close family member, who also seemed depressed, but never diagnosed, started having paranoid thoughts. He agreed to go to the hospital 3 separate times. Each time he talked to a different ER doctor (who was not trained in psychiatric medicine) and they ended up releasing him. On his release papers, they diagnosed him with schizophrenic thoughts and below that they put a paragraph in, that people with schizophrenia are more likely to commit suicide. When they released him, we asked the doctor why? Each time the response was the same “he is not a danger to himself or others”...but how are you going to say suicidal thoughts is a side of schizophrenia and not admit him into the hospital for follow up ? People with some mental health disorders do not believe they are sick and they do not think they need treatment so how do you convince them to stay in treatment when the doctors are not even helping? 
Its so heartbreaking and I wish there was more I could do. I am being supportive but the healthcare system is really failing to help mental health patients.",29Jun2020,1
57,"My friend is suffering in personal and professional relationships. His friends are leaving him and he can't attract or keep a partner, and professionally he keeps failing. I've always described him as an INTENSE person to other people. He's extremely emotionally fragile, and his ego can't stand basically any challenge. When he's trying to have a discussion with someone who disagrees with him, which is often as he so intensely tries to defend his views on things (he pathologically NEEDS to be assured he's in the right, or he'll break down, he doesn't actually want a discussion but a 'yes, what a correct view you have), he physically starts twitching in his facial muscles if things aren't going his way. He'll then pretty much tries to bully someone into agreeing with him through dismissive and overly emotional language like 'That would be bad' or 'That's just wrong' or getting overly emotional or aggressive in his language, using strawman arguments or comparing things to mass genocide, cults, witch hunts and making himself look like an idiot. Which he isn't - he's very intelligent, just emotionally inept. 

He keeps bringing up Gandhi and MLK and all these 'peaceful' people as to why pretty much no one should do anything remotely violent ever for any reason, and he thinks he's a hero because he's a passive, loving peaceful person when he very much isn't, if people don't concede to him he'll either erupt with emotional meltdowns or need reassurance or validation from another friend that he's in the right, cut the offending person out of his life, etc. He's constantly seeking feedback on himself but he actually doesn't listen to it or action it, it's just another scenario of him bullying you into agreeing with him that those things actually aren't issues.

Multiple friends walked out on him last week and he was suicidal, so I consoled him through it. He was beyond hysterical. This is a man nearing 30 who was sobbing like a child, needed to walk around the block for two HOURS in cold until midnight, and whose arm was doing a full on tourette like tic every 30 seconds which he seemed unaware of. Same with his head, he'd shake it to the side every few minute and was completely unaware it was happening. He was screaming about how people 'owed' people they're friends with a confrontation or 'THAT'S JUST WRONG, THAT'S JUST DISLOYAL, AND YOU DON'T DO THAT'. The next minute he was crying and asking me what was wrong with him and how he could fix it.

How the fuck do you help someone like this? What's wrong with him? There's obviously something mentally wrong here but when you try to comment on crappy behaviours he just has a meltdown one minute then pretends to listen the next. What the hell is happening?",29Jun2020,1
58,"Hi, this is my first post on this sub.

I've noticed a pattern that got worse in the past few months. When I'm panicking or crying a lot, my mind will eventually go numb and escape to these horrifying elaborate fantasies where i'm abused, tortured, murdered, raped, all of the above, etc. 

I have so much trouble not indulging in these thoughts when they show up. There is a sexual aspect to it but i think it's mostly my self-hatred and my self-destructive behavior manifesting themselves through imagination. I cut myself a lot and i'm very suicidal, but i don't have the strength to go through with it (not that i haven't tried).

I would stay up all night until 9 am? And then I would sleep for five hours. During this time I would just put a tv show or a YouTube video on in the background and just stare at the ceiling. I feel like I’m being swallowed by a black hole. The days are starting to mesh together and my sense of time is completely out the window. I just have zero motivation to do anything really.

I want to come off my meds and see if I can handle it without medications. I have a hard time deciding if I want to come off them because I feel better on my own or if I want to come off them because the meds makes me feel better. I hope that makes sense?

71,"TLDR: i cant tell what is real anymore. i’m worried something bad is happening to me. 

i’m not sure how to start this so i guess i just will. 
i’ve been mentally ill my entire life. the first panic attack i can recall having was in 2nd grade and it got worse as i got older. when i was 13 i was taken advantage of and it came out completely. i was diagnosed w severe panic disorder and severe depression. the anxiety was crippling. i’ve been on seroquel, prozac, visteral, wellbutrin, clonazepam and a couple others i can’t think of at the moment. i went through a major change in march after being in an abusive relationship. i was always made to question my reality, what was happening and what wasn’t. even if i knew for sure what it was. since then, i have snowballed into shit. i’m getting to a point where i can’t tell if i’m real. i cant tell if my feelings and thoughts are real. i often think to myself “is this me? or is this somehow a fake show i put on for the world and me to see at literally all times? do i feel this way or is this fake? do i think this or am i lying to myself?” and while it does sound silly, it’s very real and terrifying to me. my father developed schizophrenia in his late 20’s to early 30’s. mental illness runs in my family. i’m not sure what to do. i feel like i’m losing it. slowly, but surely. i’m scared to go to therapy because i’ll have to be 1000% honest in order to get real help but i’m scared of what they’ll do to me if i’m honest. i’m not a threat to anybody. i’ve spent my whole life taking care of and loving everyone and everything. but they will see me as a threat because i don’t know how to articulate my thoughts in a way that isn’t scary. i’m not sure what the goal is posting this. i just don’t know anymore.",29Jun2020,1

74,"It’s like 1am here and I feel like shit. I got added to a gc and scrolled up a bit too far to a convo that was about me. It kinda hurt my feelings. 

For context, I am bipolar (manic and depressive), I’m asexual, anorexic, and pretty lonely. I just got out of a pretty unhealthy relationship (on both of our parts). Whenever I make a friend I get really attached. I call them bb and say ily a lot, that’s just me. 

My guy bestfriend, who I’ve been hanging out with for around half a year likes me a lot, but I’m really not interested in dating. I’ve told him that. I just want to be friends, plus he’s not asexual. My last relationship ended because my ex wanted to have sec and I didn’t, and because I acted out a lot (I didn’t know I had BPD before, so I wasn’t controlling it very well). I don’t want to lose another best friend because a relationship didn’t work out.

I’m also scared of men, and yes, that’s sexist af, but I have really bad trust issues. I trust my friend, but the thought still freaks me out. 

I kind of led him on by calling him bb and saying ily a lot, and I feel like a dick about it. I scrolled up in this group chat and he was pissed about the whole situation which is totally understandable. His friends which I thought I was pretty cool with were just saying to not talk to me anymore, which I guess is understandable. 

I feel like an ass. I just want someone who wants to be around me without having to feel like they have to date me. I feel genuinely horrible for how I’ve treated my friend. 

I can’t even talk to anyone about how I feel because no one gives a fuck. I feel like such an asshole. I can’t even fucking eat without feeling guilty about fucking up everything I fucking touch.

80,"I think I'm stupid. Not completely, but generally.

Ever since middle school, I've managed to trick people into thinking i'm smart by filling my head with random facts to talk about to make me sound smarter than I really am. Over the last few years this tactic has seemed to have bitten me in the ass because everyone is always ""you're a smart guy"" and all that but in reality, my knowledge is horribly scattered and is mostly built on those fun fact things you've probably seen on the internet.

I'm not entirely sure since I don't know where to find the document I originally saw it on but early on, my mother brought me to all kinds of offices to assess my mental condition and have been diagnosed with aspergers syndrome. Googling the symptoms looks like describing a character based on myself so i'm 90% sure that's what's up with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in a community college and the last few semesters have been hell. Back in high school, I was pretty good with biology and prided myself of my proficiency, come college, I fall flat and fail both biology and ecology.

Okay, no big deal, I guess science isn't for me after all, maybe i'll try English, my teachers in the past have always liked my writing, a few assignments here, a mental breakdown there annnnnd FAIL. Crap, okay, maybe I should work on my weak points before trying those again, I've always been bad at math maybe I should take it slow this time around. Yes! Passed two classes with minimal issues, let's move onto a third and-

I end up bursting into tears during break and leave campus. Then dropping the class. Things aren't looking good.

Pandemic starts, classes are slated to be taken from home, barely trudge through sociology and criminal justice but come out okay, hey... I like computers, maybe i'll try a CSS class and- More tears, this makes less sense than math did, I can't even program a simple calculator, eventually dropped.

Fast forward to recently. Mass communications, generally how information is spread through various forms of media, a pretty broad topic. Too broad. Have another one of my trademark mental breakdowns. My sister (who majors in this field) can't get the material to stick in my head, mom tells me to go to sleep early. I end up laying in the dark knowing that I won't be able to submit the 5 assignments due the next day due to this roadblock and cry myself to sleep.

I wake up the next morning, go about my day awkwardly and eventually get the nerve to ask my mom what to do about all this. She insists I drop the class and just take a break until my criminology class, hopefully I'll be well equipped with criminal Justice and organized crime classes under my belt.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways that's pretty much all my failures since entering college, needless to say it has taken a toll on me, increased nervousness, paranoia, and self doubt, all that on top of the fact that I have NO major. At the moment I'm just trying to finish my area of emphasis to get a degree so I can just finally leave college with something to show for it.

For as long as I've remembered, my mom as been pressuring me to figure out what I want to do in life but I've got nothing. My two sisters have already chosen journalism and criminal profiling and one of them isn't even out of high school.

I don't know what I want to do, I know I can't take a normal cashier position because to this day I still have to count my money at least three times before being sure of the amount. My mom wants me to go into job training to see what it can provide me but to start I need to know what I want.

I don't know what I want, i'm not particularly good at anything. I do enjoy slapping together sounds to change the way games sound through modding, and games in general, but I don't feel like I can go into any of those professionally, I don't even know where to start. She recommends audio design or play-testing but my self esteem is so worn down I'm just stumped.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had to pause several times typing this to hold back tears.

My criminology class starts soon and it has my anxiety through the roof, I can't drop another class, i'm not sure why because i'm too sacred to ask my sister as to why. 

I don't like being like this, but I also don't know what to do about it. I'm at my wits end here.",29Jun2020,1
81,"Please read this. I need some help. Please.

I have always been like this but the period of online lessons has been really low. No motivation for classes and my learning progress was left so much behind. I was suicidal and at the edge of actually doing it.

Schools were resumed in my country about a month ago. At first I thought it would be terrible, I mean, it is, but not as bad as I thought. My grades are so much worse but the teachers didn't be harsh with it. They are nice and I just keep disappointing them. School is busy, like very busy. But it went surprisingly well. I don't think about suicide as often as I would because I have no time to do so. It still comes and goes but not as serious as it was. So I thought things are getting better.

But I skipped school today, again. I had plans with people today. Why would I be that irresponsible. I didn't sleep last night. I was sleepy yet those stupid thoughts just keep creeping in. I haven't showered and brushed my teeth for two days. I can smell myself and feel how greasy I am. The feeling that became too familiar by now. I feel so gross but cannot pull myself out of the couch. Before I realized, the morning has come. I just can't do this. I can't ht up. I do not have the energy for anything. So I cancelled everything I have to do just lay here. Doing nothing.

My mom asked me why I skip school again and got a little mad. She asked if I'm being bullied and checked if I have any bruises. No, I'm not. My classmates are nice. I don't have a proper answer for her question. I don't know how to answer.

For the past years since I was 10 I've been battling with \*trauma symptoms?\* I don't know. To be truthful I've been in denial and still kinda am. 

The next paragraph will talk about sexual assault so proceed with caution.

  Ever since the age of 1 my parents have been divorced and because of this my father had partial custody. He didn't start taking me to his house until I was around the age of 5 maybe a little before that.  My father was a drunk and more verbally abusive than actually abusive. While I was there normally my sister who is 7 years older than me was the abusive one, but that isn't who this is about. While my father would ""go to work"" (The bar), he would drop me and my sister off at my aunt's house. There my cousin a year older than my sister would.. I think you guys can guess. My sister and my other female cousin would help by locking me in the room with him or holding me down. This lasted until my father was arrested for sending a minor naked pictures of himself and lost custody of me and my sister.   

The issues started when my father was arrested. It started with just when people would mention the words r###,mol####, or anything like that I would have a mini panic attack. There was more things that got added to that but, It wasn't bad. For years it was like that until about 2 years ago. 2 years ago my friend turned 21, (I was 18 or 19 at the time) and I drank alcohol at her party. For the next year in a half I became kind of an alcoholic. I started remember more of what my cousin did to me. Then it became hard to figure out what was memory or what my mind made up. Eventually I stopped drinking all together because I was going to go to college and, high key, I thought it would stop. Like it was bad when I was drinking my memories away, but man if I knew it would have gotten as bad as it is now I would have kept drinking. Anyway, as of right now in the last 3 days I have slept at most 4 hours. I am thinking of quiting the internet to not have reminders to remind me of the event. There was one day I couldn't even look at my hands the whole day. My friends can't even make sexual jokes around me anymore. 

I don't know what to do, nor do I know if I am going to post this or not. I am just typing my thoughts because I am tired and done. I know that this wasn't the only bad thing that happened when I was over at my father's, so why is this the main issue I am having? Like I've been locked in closets for days and thrown into bonfires. Idk I am tired, I am sorry for taking your time if you read this.",29Jun2020,1

89,"Basically, I told myself I need to stop being so negative and start being more positive. It was going really well. I was eating healthy, being physically active, taking care of my appearance, being happy, and just positive overall. 

It was all going really well until this Saturday. Basically, my sister came back from grocery shopping and was putting the groceries away. We have two fridges, one in our kitchen and one in our garage. We put some groceries in the garage fridge and some in the kitchen fridge. When she was putting groceries in the kitchen fridge, she was complaining about how there’s so much food we don’t eat in the fridge that should be thrown out and some should be moved into the garage fridge.

She was telling me what needs to be thrown out and she was tell me nobody eats all this food and was kinda going on a rant about the food in the fridge. I kinda began to smirk and laugh a bit about how she’s going on a rant about the food in the fridge. She then got pissed at me and said “why are you laughing like your a kid, you’re not a kid anymore.” I then stopped laughing and she began to tell me what to move around. She then started saying how I do no work around the house when I do. I was washing dishes earlier and whenever she asks me to do a chore around the house I do it. Even if she asks me to get something out of her car or needs help with something, I do it. 

I began to get so pissed off by her saying that I don’t do any chores. When I was coming back from the garage, I began to bite my arm near my wrist in both arms so hard that it left teeth marks for a day. Even now, I still feel a bit of pain. Later on, I even went to my washroom and tried cutting myself with scissors. I began to think about drinking bleach and burning my body. 

I also made some threatening posts about killing myself or killing someone else on here (Reddit). I have even had thoughts about what would happen if I murdered my entire family and then killed myself after. Somehow, I began to think about a middle school bully  and began to think about potentially harming him because I know where he lives. I began to say that I need to seek revenge on him. I was even thinking that when I go for a walk, I’ll just jump infront of a car and hopefully die from getting hit or I was even thinking about jumping infront of a train. When I was even taking a bath, I literally felt like drowning myself in it.

92,"Maybe I'd go to sleep and wake up healthier since I can't seem to gather the motivation to make myself healthier. Maybe I'd go to sleep and wake up and the pandemic would be over. Go to sleep and wake up to new things to keep me from feeling empty. 

I'm so tired of worrying about the virus and how it could kill me because of my bad health and I'm so tired of feeling like I'm just trapped and can't do anything because I don't have the motivation to take care of myself. 

I'm so tired of my stupid fear of running out of time. 

I'm tired of being scared. I'm just really, really tired. I can play a bunch of games and watch a bunch of TV shows but, in the end, I still just feel tired of everything and empty. 

So I find more and more stuff to watch or play to not feel empty and tired but the enjoyment never stays. Sometimes it lasts for a long while, but it never just stays. Not that I stop liking it, I just start to become less and less obsessive after a while. 

In between that and finding something new to like, it just feels like nothing. If I don't have something keeping me happy, I won't be happy. I won't be sad either. I'll just feel nothing. 

I can't wake up and feel like smiling or wake up and feel like it's gonna be a good day. There's a void that I constantly try to fill with stuff that makes me happy and it just never works. Especially not lately. Last year I got really obsessed with a game for about 6 whole months. After a while, my brain apparently decided it was time to stop and since then, I haven't been able to like anything that much. I finish a show? I have to find another one right after. I haven't been able to just enjoy it for a while.

I'm tired of having to find things to keep me happy. Maybe this is normal, I don't know. Maybe people normally don't just feel happy without some reason for it. Maybe there's nothing actually wrong with me and I'm just doing this to feel special or something. Maybe my lack of motivation is just me being lazy and convincing myself that it's a lack of motivation. I honestly can't tell.

98,"*this might not make sense to most people*

I feel like these three words can define my whole life. For as long as I can remember I've had trouble making decisions. When I was in my teens I was having problems in making decisions, important decisions like picking a major or what I want to study as well as easy ones like where do I wanna eat lunch. But back then I didn't think much of it. As I grew up, right after high school is when major changes started to happen in my life. I couldn't decide on what to pick for my college education. There were times every option seemed doable and there were times when nothing seemed favourable. 
So for most part in my life I do things which are most commonly followed by people, thinking that is probably the safest bet as majority of people do it. So I got into engineering, like most Indian kids. I simply did it because I didn't know what else to do. I was miserable the whole while I was there. My grades sucked, I had no friends, only two people I talked to because we went to college together. I didn't like anyone. For 4 years of my college I spend my day sitting in class waiting for it to end. zoned out. Absolutely blank. I didn't even leave class during lunch breaks. 

I have been living in the same house with my mom my whole life (Im 23now). My father used to work UAE for 10 year from when I was in 6th standard to when I finished my graduation. I cannot remember much of my childhood days. The only thing I remember is my mom and dad fighting and shouting. Everything is a blurr. So much that, I can almost remember an incident when my dad was trying to hit my mom with a belt and I held onto it to stop him. Now I don't know if it was real or I'm just making it up in my head. 

Now I'm 23, graduated last year with shitty grades, and I'm at my first job for the last 9 months which I couldn't give less fucks about. I got this job simply because I didn't know what else to do and came across an ad. It doesn't pay much, I'm mostly sitting in front of the laptop. But it pays the bills. 

Now days the indecisiveness has become much more prominent. It's like a constant battle in my head about what I should do. Should I do this, should I do that, what if I had done this, what if it was the other way around. I just don't know. All I want is to be dead. I have been wishing for death for the last 4 years. Not that i have made any attempts to take my life. I have just been hoping to die. In any manner no matter how painful. Just for this miserable life to end. 

I think the only reason I have not killed my self or tried to so far, is because I have to support my family now. My father is retired. And me and my sister are working. I am 4 years younger. I feel so helpless that I don't even have the option to end my own life because others depend it. Which somehow seems worse than being dead. When you're dead, you're just dead. It's those around you who have to get through this pain. But when you want to die and you know that it's not an option. You have to suffer every single day. Pretending to be normal. 

I have been considering going to therapy for the past two months, because it's not a common thing around here to seek therapy. If you're from India, I think you can relate. Growing up I didn't even know there's a thing called therapy. There's hardly anyone talking about going to therapy. 

But the thing is... I don't know!

I don't know if what I am going through is actually some mental health issue or I am just being overanalytical or exaggerating things. I don't know if it's depression, dysthymia, aboulomania. I don't know if going to a therapist would be the best thing. 

Since the lockdown I have been looking this stuff up on Google and that's where I came across the term. Aboulomania. Idk if what I am going through classifies as that. And I don't want to call myself depressed because I know there are people going to much much worse. 

IS THIS WORTH GOING TO THERAPY?

All I know is, I tell myself that 'i wish I was dead' about 10 times a day. I have been feeling this way for the past 4-5years. I know that I am scared of everything. 

I don't know if I wanna get better. And I don't know why I am even writing this. If you have actually read this far, I thank you for your patience, and if there's someone out there who feels same please hmu.",29Jun2020,1

My parents are like why cant you just sleep earlier?

Sometimes I talk to myself to feel better,(using code words and references so nobody except me knows what I'm saying. I cant hide this now that my parents are working from home. It's like when I try to vent to myself while doing anything, then my parents call me insane and say that I have no friends because of this. When I wake up late they lament over the sunlight I'm missing, even though I know that its probably because they cant monitor me, as shown when I'm not in a place they can easily monitor me.

100,"During the coronacrisis I have moved back in with my parents temporarily because I didn't wanna be bouncing round my flat alone.

I've been going through my old stuff and I managed to sell one of my old toys for around 300 dollars, which was awesome.

I remembered my Dad had hamstringed me into sending a load of the same toys to my nan's house so my cousin's kids could play with them. 

Selfishly I hadn't really wanted to give as many away as I did but I'd felt guilty about keeping old toys as a grown adult. Plus it would be nice for them to be played with by my cousins.

Anyhow the kids didn't play with them, so I went back to my nan's to see if I could go through them and maybe keep or sell more of them. However, since this was a while ago, she told me she'd given them to charity.

For some reason I got really really angry and upset. Like irrationally so. I didn't rage or shout and I told my nan it was okay but she could see I was angry. I was digging my nails into my palms and all I wanted to do was leave.

The anger has been white-hot since yesterday and I started thinking about my whole life and how badly I'm doing, which stirred up some old suicidal feelings. I couldn't cover it up entirely and I'm incredibly embarrassed that my brother and Dad have witnessed parts of my mini-meltdown.

But it's so stupid! All over some old toys that I gave away anyway! I feel so horrible and selfish for feeling this way. I'm a grown adult with a job and income, it would have been great to sell or keep some of them but it's not that important. I haven't even properly calmed down yet.

I don't know if it's because I felt cajoled into giving them away in the first place, I'm sometimes a doormat. Or I'm just really frustrated about life and this was the last straw. Or I'm just angry at my Dad in general. He doesn't understand when people get upset and thinks you're being hysterical. I've had mental health problems in the past and I think he just thinks I'm unstable (perhaps he's right).

Thank you greatly for reading this tirade. If you have any kind of insight as to why I'm being so crazy or just feel similarly angry out of nowhere it would be great to know I'm not alone. Good luck to all of you out there too, I appreciate my stupid story is nothing compared to those going through proper health problems.",29Jun2020,1

I had a group of friends 2 years ago when I started college but they dumped me a few months after I started dating my ""jock"" boyfriend (who is the sweetest guy and pretty damn smart, but a ""jock"" because he plays college football, allegedly). I guess I kinda gave up on forming good friendships after they dumped me a year ago. I just relied on my boyfriend and his friends  who I really like, but it really sucks having no friends of my own.

108,"So last night I was at a little party and I decided to suggest a song. Normally I don't speak up like that,  but another song reminded me of this one, and I wanted to see if anyone knew the song. I'm a few (5ish) years older than the rest of that friend group, and I enjoy examining the slight generational differences between us. So I suggest the song. I didn't explain my reasoning very well, no one recognized it, it was a kind of weird song and no one really enjoyed it, and it kind of killed the mood for a minute. The girl playing the music said she didn't like it and switched it back, and that was it. Or should have been. It was kinda awkward for a moment, but people moved on quick. No big deal, right? 

My anxiety will not let it go!! Seriously! I just can't stop thinking about it. ""You ruined the night!"" ""They hated it!"" ""They think you're weird!"" ""They don't want to hang out with you anymore!"" ""You should never have said anything!"" ""No one likes you!"" ""You're an outsider!""  ""You should self harm because of this!"" Etc. I could go on forever. 

It's bad. I always do this. I do something wrong or awkward or whatever when socializing and then obsess over it for days, weeks. Sometimes is bothers me years after!! I can't stop the obsessive self hating thoughts. It's like, logically, I know it's not as big of a deal as I think. They've probably all but forgotten.

118," Hello,

First of all, thank you for reading! To make a very long story short, last year I went out for my birthday and on my uber ride back home I witnessed a man on a bike get hit by a drunk driver running a red light going over 70 mph. The only people there were me and my uber driver. The drunk driver never slowed down (and was later caught and has been on trial this whole time) so my uber driver blocked the street off and called 911 and I ran over to see if I could help the guy that was hit.

I have seen many people die online out of morbid curiosity and to prepare myself for if I ever saw it in real life and what I saw that night, I was in no way prepared for. I had been drinking but sobered up IMMEDIATELY. The bicyclist was killed instantly, his body had landed well over 100 feet from where he was hit. I could go into detail about what it looked like in the comments if you would like.

When this happened I was broke and already at a low point in my life, and to top it off, we stayed for the investigation for 3 hours before the police released us. I had no money, lived 9 miles away, the uber driver wanted to go straight home to his family, the cops wouldn't give me a ride and no one answered their phone (at this time its 5AM Sunday morning) so I walked all 9 miles home bawling my eyes out.

I've talked very openly to friends who sort of just say ""wow that's crazy"" or ""I couldn't imagine what that is like"", they mean well but I feel like my cries for help fall on deaf ears. I don't have insurance and decided to pay out of pocket for therapy. I had 2 sessions with 2 different therapists and they both told me that whenever I'm feeling happy, to think about that night. Seems counter productive for me and I've expressed that to both of them.

I know there is no miracle that's just going to erase that night out of my mind but do any of you have recommendations on where to begin or what to look for when finding a therapist? The mother of the man that was killed reached out to me last month and I ended up meeting her last week to kind of talk about who her son was as a person and know more about him, it was a very heavy day but I think it was good for the both of us.

Once again, thank you listening I appreciate it!",29Jun2020,1
119,"I want to understand and perhaps help my former partner (now friend) who has long been suffering from some kind of mental illness issue?

symptoms

  
she often feels anxious when there's something important. leading to poor eating, sleepless nights

there are days when she just stays up most of the night sad

there are days where she says she is afraid of all men and doesn't want to be around one

there are many instances where she over thinks things, especially unrealistic scenarios

some news, such as killings or other violence, seems to get her down

&amp;#x200B;

when I look at her art, they are generally quite dark.

For example, drawings where her character is all alone, other drawings where the character is in some kind of pain (either physical or mental), and sometimes drawings with messages of wanting to be understood

I've asked her what might have caused it and she thinks it might be because of her abusive ex. although that was from five years ago. and it seemed he was mentally abusive but not physically. but I suspect there's more than that she won't tell me or her doctor.  her family only tells me that they're always worried about her, but I think they're too focused on other things than on her.",29Jun2020,1

I am hoping to recruit participants to take part in my online study. The study is trying to find out how different temporary mindsets (called 'schema modes') link with wellbeing. Previous studies have found that people with eating disorders may experience more unhelpful mindsets than usual. Also, that 'Schema Therapy', which deals with these mindsets, could be useful for helping this group of people. The results of this study will be important to support the assessment of the schema modes of people with eating disorders, which could then help Schema Therapy to treat eating disorders.

To be eligible to take part, you must be 18+ and have had an eating disorder diagnosis.

I have gone on and off ""dieting"" the past couple of years, and it's not because I couldn't stick to anything (although that has its own challenges) it's because of this **dumb** and **overwhelming** urge to need pizza. It definitely started as a source for emotional eating a few years ago, but I also loved cooking food and whatnot, so it never became this giant thing.

When my country went into lockdown for 4-5 weeks due to COVID, it was quite literally, bliss. I didn't have temptations because there was nothing to be tempted by. Pizza didn't exist! It wasn't allowed. I thought after lockdown maybe things would stay calm, but they are worse than ever before and it is crushing my mental and physical health. If I get distressed by anything, I turn to pizza. Nothing in the house to eat because I don't want to take it out of the freezer? Pizza. Cat diagnosed with cancer? Pizza. Celebrating weight loss? PIZZA!

I fucking loathe pizza. It is the most boring food on the planet, but I have an addiction.

We've been together for about a year and a half and have both noticed that she also develops obsessions when the depression gets better. Whether it be with her uni work or a tv show, she becomes so emotionally attached to things to the point where she will think about a character's death for days. 

It doesnt bring up any issues in our relationship at all, and as far as I'm aware it doesn't stop her going about her daily activities. She explained that she feels she may be bipolar because her highs are so energetically high and her lows are often suicidal, but she doesn't want to self-diognose.

I'm curious if anyone else experiences these obsessive interests, and if they coincide with their mental health. I love her so much and want to familiarise myself with what she copes with as best I can.

132,"Relationships are an integral part of an individual’s life and have evolved as a concept over time. Modern-day relationships are not linear, and neither are they black and white. The lines between the wrong and the right have been blurred and rightfully so, because love and human attachment cannot be confined. While the blurring of boundaries gives more space to experiment, understanding, and to grow together; it comes with its own set of misunderstandings and other problems that could drive a couple apart. [Couple therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/couples-therapy/) is therefore a thing in 2020 and has been a thing since quite some time now. Being together in any way with someone is like building a fort together that only stands as strong as its pillars. The pillars in a relationship are trust, communication, and understanding. 

Individual’s mental health plays a very important role in a relationship. Humans often make decisions based on what they have learnt and experienced. One bad relationship often creates trauma that makes it difficult for an individual to trust someone again. Therefore, it is extremely vital that when a person decides to get into a relationship, they do not have any unresolved issues from their past relationships, romantic or unromantic both. One’s scars are a part of them. Learning and growing together with him is the way to go about happy relationships. Your partner should be able to trust you as well understand you and your opinions. You should be able to do the same as well. Any relationship is only a smooth ride if the people involved in it can be themselves to the fullest potential while adding someone else into their lives. Losing a sense of who you are and what you like and believe in, only because you want someone else to accept you is like sitting in a plane you know is bound to crash. If you are dating someone, make sure that you’re open and accepting towards someone else’s opinion and way of life. Mutual respect and understanding always goes a long way. If you feel you cannot express your feelings and your opinions to your partner, then maybe it is time you stop ignoring the red flags. You should try seeking [couple therapy Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/couples-therapy/) or in another city you’re based in. 

Most modern relationships fail because people try to put numbers or try to make love finite. Casual, committed, flings, friends with benefits, and various other concepts that are acceptable and practiced worldwide will only be successful without hurting any of the partners if they communicate from the very beginning. Never in your relationship should you feel like you are burdened, or you are trapped. Sharing problems and solving them together as a couple is okay as long all share the load. Human attachments often come with a price that you should be willing to pay with love and understanding. Dating, being in a relationship, getting married, and starting a family are often considered milestones in one’s life that often follow each other but need not. You are your own master and should be able to make your decisions without the constraints and the prejudices of the society. Seeking help and wanting to improve yourself and your relationship is never wrong. You can see a sex therapist or even a [family therapist in Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/family-therapy/) if you wish to. Whether you met online or you met via mutual friends, or you met via your parents in an arranged setting, just know that any partner who you decide to be with in any way should let you be yourself.",29Jun2020,1

Never feel like you are failing just because you aren't keeping up with society's list of arbitrary milestones. Don't waste time trying to reach goals you don't even want but feel like you are supposed to want or that other people will judge you for if you don't keep up. Figure out what YOU want from life and then figure out what you need to do it.",29Jun2020,1

136,"So where I live summer vacation has just started and I'm kinda desperate to get out of the house. My home situation isn't the best and now that the schools are closed I no longer have an excuse to be out for a longer period of time. What I mean by that is, my parents are quite neglectful and toxic. My mother says she's too tired to do as little as talk to me and because my father broke his leg they now expect me to be their full-time maid.
I've been struggling with my mental health during school alot and summer vacation was supposed to be an opportunity to unwind.
And that's why I'm looking for a club I can join or some sort of regular activity I can do so I don't have to be stuck in the house all the time. I have, however, NO IDEA where to look for it.

So I was wondering if anyone has any idea how/where I can find out what clubs/activities are in my area? Or maybe something I can do on my own?
I'm open to suggestions.",29Jun2020,1
137,"
Matched with a PA student through a dating app, but not sure what’s going now. Trying to be patient but also don’t want to be dragged along in along in a game of pen pals. 

For background — I met her on Hinge at the end of April and we clicked really well (as most of these stories start out) -- a few days later we had our first phone call and talked for almost 5 hours, conversation flowed great, and shortly after our call she followed up with a message. She recently moved back home because of COVID as her school shut down for physical distancing. She's currently in a grad-med school program (meeting online) so schedules throughout May were really difficult, not only being busy throughout the week, but almost everything in our state shut down.

During our time chatting across 2 months, her messages to me would always be SUPER detailed, taking time to answer every question, continue asking me questions, and keep the conversation going -- even during times when I didn't push anything forward. I just don't understand if you're not interested in someone, why you'd spend time writing lengthy messages to them, being vulnerable to that person, and even flirting.

She originally pushed for us to meet up, but then when I proposed actually dates and specific things we could do, I wouldn't get anything solidified, always ended with she'd check her schedule and let me know a good time when she'd be free. What is frustrating is if she wasn't interested then I don't know how hard it is to break it off with someone or tell them you're not interested. But we continued in conversation through the rest of the month. At one point I asked for a a specific time and place, and she had a schedule conflict with family (baby shower) -- but shared she'd look at her schedule and let me know another time. She continued in conversation for me, but I never got an alternative date.

As we entered June and things began to open up again, I suggested meeting and again - that bridge of our conversation only ended in her telling me she'd check her schedule and get back with a date.


Fast forward to last weekend, and she shared that she'd be moving back to her city (4 hours away) but she wanted to still meet me before she did. She also shared that her sister-in law was due to have a baby in a few weeks, so she'd have many more opportunities to be back home. She shared that her week was pretty crammed with multiple tests and projects, but asked if the weekend would be best? Of course I let her know the weekend would be great, so she said she'd let me know a good time we could aim for.

Yay me, excited to finally meet her and move forward, trying to have patience with this season knowing it's not easy for anyone, and not wanting to push or add pressure to her. So Friday rolls around and that evening she messages me saying that her sister in law has been admitted into the hospital for complications, the family on duty to help at their house, but that she still wanted to meet during the weekend as long as nothing serious health wise went down with the family. I didn't respond because I was busy working on a project -- an hour later she sent a follow up message asking if I wanted to do anything that night. Since it was late in the evening, everything (coffee shops, most parks) would be closed down -- but I offered to still meet up after I finished work or even do a phone call, it would have to be after 9PM, but whatever she was comfortable with.

She responded by sharing that since it would be dark by then, Saturday (the next day) would be better to aim for as long as her sister-in law were okay.

The weekend rolls around, I hear nothing from her on Saturday.

Nothing all day today (Sunday)

Finally, Sunday night I get a message from her that her sister did have health compilations through the weekend being induced, her father got into a car accident, and she's leaving back for her city but ""we should FaceTime one night!"" followed by the fact she doesn't know what her schedule will look like when she gets back to campus since everything has been up in the air.

She ended her message hoping I had a good weekend (that added acid to the burns).

Right now, I feel pained because of all the time I spent in talking with her across 2 months (patient because of how uncertain and wild this season is with COVID). I felt like her message tonight was breadcrumbs and I just don't understand why she continues to talk when she could just ghost me, and has had many times to do so. I don't feel like responding anymore, but I believe in treating people the way you want to be treated, so perhaps a final message would be appropriate? Thoughts?",29Jun2020,1
138,"I live in Bangladesh, Dhaka. This isn't exactly the most economically flourishing place. But to me, the worst aspect of it is the healthcare. It is terrible that it failed to detect any problems with my health. It also enabled my asshole, egotistical, parasite of an older brother to think that am making excuses just so I can play the computer as much as I want. He has no proper basis nor any logical conclusion, just something he concocted out of his paranoia and spite for me. The problem with this country most of all is the youth suffering from their abusive family very easily and get left destroyed.

I was a sensitive kid, so I was pretty shy. But my brother did what he could to twist the narrative that I was disobedient and don't listen to anybody or respect them. He was horrible towards me even before my health issues started. I was raised in a family of 5 children and one parent, my mother. My father died when I was nearly 2, we used to live in a different country before we moved back after his death. So most of the finance was handled by my older brothers, mostly notably the asshole.

I've been fighting an illness that no hospital in BD managed to detect, stating that it could be all in my head. That I was hypochondriac or psychosomatic. 11 years of fighting this, I didn't get to finish my higher education, am left without much job experience. While my sister got her degree and had the family spent for her wedding, I had little spent on my healthcare. I was close to committing suicide 4 years ago, that's when my family listened but not him, of course not him. He assumed he knew better. He always does.

I was ready to head out to Kolkata for my diagnosis right before the pandemic happened. So instead I consulted with a doctor in Kolkata online, she consulted that it was IBS related, so I dug in, did my best to do some research and I found that most of my symptoms fit with Fibromyalgia.

    https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/fibromyalgia/symptoms/

The kind of symptoms I carry are stomach bloatness, backpain, heartburn, foul mouth, chronic nerve wrecking headaches, weak sensation, feeling tired, jointpain, gastric problems and so on. Worst part are the uncontrollable thoughts that were circulating in my head, things I didn't know were there. Sometimes I'd panic when talking to someone or I'd be in a catatonic state. It was difficult to focus and hear what other people are saying. Sometimes it get so intense, my head would get so heavy it'd get numb.

My family after doing so well spending for themselves, now suffering from financial problems and are stating that they won't be able to afford my education abroad even though they've done well enough for themselves. I've been humiliated, look down upon, wrongly judged by all sorts of people. Most of them here are spiteful, easy to make odd ideas about who you are and use their friends circle to spread rumors without you knowing.

These days I get angry, even though my health isn't good. I couldn't handle any of this any longer. My life was a joke, I was treated like crap as a kid and now my family pushed it too far. I don't want to live, the more my anger was uncheck, the more I had homicidal thoughts of beating the shit of my brother, bashing his fucking head in. I can't hold a job, I couldn't afford a rent of my own. Nobody was of help and nobody could even thanks to how backward ass the economy in this country is, even my rich friends were struggling to make ends meet before C19.

Am 28 years old, it's as if am cursed. Am done with this life, I spite god for letting me suffer even though I've prayed. I did what I could to ask for his help. I have no dignity left to save or anything without my name being sullied any longer. I use the computer to play games to keep my anxiety in check, but it's harder when people are looking at you thinking that you're still holding a false story.

This goddamn pandemic couldn't have picked a worse time, my family won't even spend money on online courses. I don't even have my own room while my stupid sister gets to live in her master bedroom and even act petty about it. My mother is too old and is dealing with health problems of her own to help me out even though she did what she could with the resources she had.....

Am considering repeating what I did 4 years ago. I just wish people would help, I want my own place. I want to stay isolated for once so that I could think clear and figure out what to do with my life while I fix my health first and foremost.",29Jun2020,1

142,"Don't read if you have OCD, potentially triggering stuff,

been dealing with intrusive thoughts and OCD for a long, long time now and have gotten kind of okay at dealing with them although every day is still a struggle.

But now they've taken a turn for the worst and are commonly ruining things I used to enjoy like music, games and films because I can't stop myself from thinking about the source of them and how the source causes harm.

For example, I hear beautiful music on an acoustic guitar but i can no longer feel it because as soon as  i hear it i just start thinking about how the wood used to make that guitar used to be a tree and that the tree would've had to have been cut down and there may have been birds living in that tree who were killed etc.

or playing video games or using anything electric for fun, keep thinking about global warming and how electricity is contributing to it and then i think about polar bears drowning etc. this applies to electric music i used to love as well. 

i can't feel the emotions i used to enjoy from listening to these songs because the intrusive thought instantly swoops in and just kills the vibe entirely. i don't know what i can do, it seems so deeply ingrained in me now and i fucking hate it so much",29Jun2020,1
143,"My mom is depressed after the passing of my younger brother last month. Of course I understand that this is the most traumatic thing she will endure. It hurt me for her and my dad. It’s been hard on our whole family. I have done my best to get the help that I need. I see a therapist and am taking an anti-depressant which has helped me quite a bit because I was also spiraling down when this all happened. 

She wakes up everyday crying and is just chronically sad. She barely eats. I’m first and foremost concerned but secondly, it’s emotionally draining to see her like that. 

I encourage her to get extra help. She talks to a therapist sometimes but I really think she needs medication just to get through these first few months but she won’t listen.

145,"Well.. Ive had mental health issues for as long as i remember, and a consistent factor in not doing too hot is my stress level.

I currently work a pretty stressful job. I’m an intern at a real estate agency, and I’m on call to answer inquiries from 8 am to 9 pm. I’m pretty much on alert the entire time and i can’t do anything that would require me to be unable to step away and answer my phone at any moment. It’s gutted everything I like to do in my free time. It blows because I only get paid for actual time working, not the rest of that day.. and then there’s regular office hours of 8-5 that I work.

Im almost out of here - I’ll be done with the process and my exam in a few months. But in the meantime my other team member moved up and his replacement quit, so I get left holding double the responsibility to add to it for a few weeks now. 

Needless to say I need to get a grip. I don’t know how to relax. I get 77 hours of truly free time to myself a week - and that includes times I need to set aside for sleeping. I feel suffocated. I just need to make it— if anyone has any advice I would greatly appreciate it.",29Jun2020,1

148,"Hello there, I'm still kinda new to this sub and english is not my first language, so please excuse me if something is outta line. 

Lately, I've been gaming a bit too much that my parents started to notice that I played too much games. In their opinion, this why I don't have many friends, keeping me unemployed, and losing my focus, because of video games. On my side of the story, I'm gaming because I think it's the only way that I can cope with my Persisten Depressive Disorder (some called it Dysthymia, I believe), and I had a good journey with video games because it distracted my mind from suicidal thoughts and self-harm. 

I don't know why everytime my parents keep yelling at me just because I play video games every day. Oh, and on the side note, I live with my parents because they wanted to 'bond' with me as the oldest son, so I moved in to their house. I am now currently unemployed because of the coronavirus, my boss (also my mom's brother-in-law) told me that all of the project that we'll be working, is going to be continued in 2021, so yeah thats about my 'unemployment'.

Also, everytime that I cause minor 'inconvenience' to my parents, they would criticize me and not just a single burst out comments, it's a long rant and it makes me very sad. My eyes got watery while I'm typing this part. I don't know why are they always criticize me for just a small mistake and not helping me to be a good person. I always helped around the house, like doing chores and delivering the laundry.

Deep down inside, I don't want them to be sad, but at the same time, they're the reason why I don't want to take care of them when they're old. It's too depressing to live with them. I love them both. But really I don't know how to deal it. Is it just me? Or is it my parents?. A single reply would really help me to understand it. 

PS: I live in an Asian Muslim household, so yeah, I don't know if that would help but that's that.

TL;DR, My parents yelled me because I play video games, what should I do?",29Jun2020,1
149,"I’ve recently become aware of how little of my life I actually remember. It’s hard for my to recall much of anything, most of my ‘memories’ are just other people’s stories. This is true for all of my life even up in to recent years. I know I’ve always had a horrible habit of lying or exaggerating and that’s only made things worse. This is something I’ve really worked on in my adult life but I still do it here and there without catching myself. That has made remembering anything extremely difficult because I cannot differentiate between what was real and what was made up. Recently I’ve been getting this overwhelming feeling that I’ve been blocking something BIG from myself - but I don’t know if that’s a real or what it could possibly be. It feels like I’m on the brink of realizing something I probably don’t want to know, but also something that could lead to a lot of understanding.

I’ve STRUGGLED and am still struggling with identity, purpose, even just having my own ideas. Everything feels so foreign to me at all times and like my life is happening to me while I just stand idly by. Maybe uncovering this ‘block’ could help me but I don’t even know where to start.",29Jun2020,1

159,"I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for as long as I remember, there were times in my life were things are ok and/or bearable.

My grandpa also died last year when I had a few months in this relationship. His death has been really hard. 

After many tries we decided to try once more and even tho things were somewhat ok I’d still have very negative thoughts about the relationship all the time, I feel so insecure and my anxiety is with me all the time and I can not bear it anymore.

162,"Hello people, 

I just want to write down my story so I can practice externalising the thoughts that I have grappled with the past 15 years or so and maybe inspire people to do the same or bring you some comfort. I conclude with some tips that helped me feel better. 

I'm currently 24, studying philosophy and I am in the best psychological state when I compare it to past ones. 

But let me put you in my psychological state that I found myself in when I was a child. Parents divorced at around 7-8 without any explicit notice to me or my sister, as if they thought that everything was going to remain the same and the disappearance of my father from home wouldn't make us think that there was something going on. That was quite a traumatic experience given that I was in a situation where I knew something was wrong with my parents but they did not care to make a conversation with me as to what exactly was changing and, heck, how that was affecting me. 

Independently of that, my mom was such a great pain in the ass while we lived together. She would shout and curse at me for stupid reasons- like me breaking a glass or not taking my shoes off- and she would make me read the whole time. She's a teacher and all she cared was me doing well in school so I would become a dentist and take over my father's job. That's it. Nothing more than that. A great majority of my childhood years revolved around her ""teaching"" me during the regular school year and summers. We would fight like hell cause I gradually got pissed with her putting me in uncomfortable situations when I was studying with her. I remember once I was crying and she wouldn't even tolerate my crying insisting that I should shut up and get on with my work. Crazy shit. Oh, my mother would here and then hit me with her tool that you make pies with (the cylindrical one). 

Even crazier were the fights she had with my father. Yelling at each other from the top of their lungs, my mother faking or trying, I don't know, to throw up while talking with my father. I was so embarrassed of all of this. Everyone in the neighborhood knew the crazy situations that were taking place. 

Anyways, all these things were taking place from the age of 7-8 to 18. The year from 17 to 18 was the cherry in the cake. It was the year that my mother had long trained me to go through. A lot of pressure was exerted on me, as she was expecting me that I would write well and go study dentistry. Not once did she ask me what the hell were MY personal interests and what I loved working on NOT because of the money. Anyways, at the end of this year there were the national exams. I kind of delibaretely did not write well on the physics exam so I would diminish the chances of getting the required grade for entering dentistry. And this is what happened. I tricked my parents in telling them that I would retake the exam the following year and I applied for mathematics, for the sake of it. After such a long year with a lot of pressure and anxiety- fuck Biology, I never cared about DNA and RNA- I was not ready to confront them about what I had, at that time, in mind to do after highschool. 

During October- 5 months after the national exams took place- I randomly left the school where they were preparing students to retake the exams. It was hell. My mother questioned everything I told her about my desire to become a mathematician and she- stiff as a rock- insisted on the 18 year old story that she had been telling me about becoming a dentist. More disapproval, more negativity, more questioning of my abilities, more insecurity, more anger. I did not give a fuck, though. I had very big psychological problems by that time (18 year old) but for one thing I was not going to give up on something that I knew expressed MY desires and MY interests and not my mother's. It was the first time I was doing something because I knew it was coming from me and I knew that there was no succumbing taking place, this time. It was my escape route from all the crazy shit I had gone through while I was little that had tormented my psychological life and had given me so much insecurity and lack of self-worth that I am still struggling with now. 

Anyways, after 4 years I successfully obtained my bachelor's degree in mathematics and I had my mother smiling at the ceremony. No doubt, she had changed her mind and after the first troublesome year, she had softened and was more supportive of my studies. 

But, I too had improved my relationship with her. I decided (at 19!) to go to a psychologist to sort out the problems that I was facing with and my attitude towards my mother. In college, I tried to confront her about whether she was sorry for all the hardships she made me go through and every time the outcome of the conversation was the same. She pleaded no guilt and was acting like she didn't know what I was talking about. Crazy. She told me that all she wanted to do was secure a future for me where I would not care about money and I would be well paid. For her, this goal somehow overshadowed all the other things that were destroyed along the way- like my confidence- and they were casualties that were not worthy of her attention. How convincing. Anyways, I knew I had to fix myself as there was no chance my mother would do that for herself- she was just too afraid to face the reality of her attitude towards me due to her psychological problems that she was carrying with from her childhood. I tried and successfully did stop being harsh on her and realised that I was harming myself by exhorting the same anger that she had exhorted on me when I was a kid. This was no easy job to do. 

Nevertheless, this was just the first thing that I had to sort out and, as you might guess, it was not the only one. For the last 5 years (from 19 and onwards) I have been trying to rebuild myself- psychologically speaking. I had to learn by myself what it means to acquire confidence and what it means to be in a confident state of mind- things that I so rarely got to practice when I was a teenager. 

During the last two years of my undergraduate studies I experienced another shock as I realised that I wanted to become a philosopher, but I did not have the balls to make explicit moves towards this direction and tell my parents about it, as I knew that there was going to be a similar storm. However, I did manage to externalise this and did eventually continue my studies with philosophy. 

My mother, as well as my dad, are not evil persons though. They are just people with severe psychological problems that influenced their actions and their behaviour towards me. That's all. Whenever I think that they are the reason I have to experience so much anxiety and pain for meaningless reasons, I just laugh as I realise that it's the past me that is speaking right now. Nowadays, I try to break out of this type of thought and realise that it's me who is causing all this suffering. It's all the habits that I developed through my childhood and all the negative thoughts that I did. I was so alienated from myself that I never realized that it was me who was putting myself down and not someone else. The other was an external factor that would simply ignite the problem that was ALREADY existing within ME. I take great pains to realise this through self-contemplation, by talking with psychologists, friends, by TALKING. 

It's so hard to talk about your psychological problems nowadays. I don't even bother talking about them with my mother as I know I will put her in a discomforting position. Everyone just seems so oblivious to the dynamics and the quality of the negative thoughts that you are not taken seriously. I feel even some psychologists do not appreciate the perplexity of the issue, as they overuse phrases like be yourself or what have you and they do not care on dealing with the actual problem they are faced with- my peculiar psychological problem. 

Nevertheless, shit can become more manageable and it will as long as you put the work. What it means to make it work and go from the point Z to a slightly better point is another story and it requires a lot of experimenting, as well as listening and implementing what trained people in the field have to say, of course. What I have come to realise is that dealing with your psychological problems does not differ from dealing with any other type of problem whatsoever. If you want to build a body you better not do the exercises in a way that they physically injure you. Now, the key to making progress is to be patient enough to realise that what you are doing is not taking you to the right direction and the way you can realise this is by HEARING yourself. This is so important and so underrated, especially if you have spent a considerable amount of time being taught NOT to HEAR yourself and what yourself demands and wants. Nevertheless, for me, this has been the ONLY way to make progress and be more psychologically fit. I could write a hell more about the way I make psychological progress, but my starting and ending point is always this: try to attend to what YOU want/feel/desire in the specific moment you are working with your psyche and work your way through this mental process by trying to stick to the very thing you are attending to and do not try to overcome the problem merely with the help of an external cause or thought. Take SERIOUSLY the very task of HEARING yourself and do not, for any moment, let go of YOURSELF in this process. This will make all the difference as you will gradually re-learn what it means to have a firm relationship with yourself and how you can withstand any obstacle. Psychological flexibility- something noone ever taught me about- is your only saviour and God.",29Jun2020,1
164,"My girlfriend and I crossed paths 3 and a half years ago. At this point I was a very happy outgoing, flirty, positive person with the world at my feet and I felt nothing could bring me down. I had a large variation of friends and had sufficient money to get me by each month.

When we were friends she acted a lot to me, at this point she was 18 and I was 23, at the beginning I was tossed back and forth if the age was a bit weird and if I should stay clear. 

She persistently always gave me the 'eyes' in passing, at this point I was infatuated with another woman based in the same office as my current girlfriend and I. I proceeded to see them both at the same time both not serious but occasional flings, I genuinely couldn't choose between them but the girl I was infatuated with had a complicated history with her ex so I opted to take a leap of faith with my current girl. 
I feel from this point on my mental health  started to go downhill, as she was fairly young she used to love going out to nightclubs and get super drunk and vent her feelings towards me, this turned out to be another complicated ex story ( hes now passed away and she still brings him up often ) she suffered sexual abuse earlier in life which I didnt find out till 6-7 months into our relationship. 

She fell pregnant 2 or 3 months into our relationship and having both living at home with our parents, we opted to move in to our own place, we lived there for 2 years and it put massive financial strain on the pair of us as I opted to further my education during this time as I only got the office job due to saving to be self sufficient during my education. When my 1st daughter was born this put A LOT of strain on our relationship, a few months in a dont want to say I resented my daughter as she's a baby but I was frustrated that the stress of a new baby was weighing down our relationship. My girlfriend started to be miserable and resented the fact I left my job to pursue my education in hopes of gaining a career path. She started having an issue with my female friends which she stated was due to trust issues from a previous relationship but for the sake of her I stopped speaking to my female friends. I stopped playing video games which was my favourite hobby as she said she couldn't cope watching the baby on her own. Her mother ended up moving in with us as she recently broke up with her long term boyfriend, after a few months i caught her and her mum bitching about how lazy and laid back I am, I let it slide and tried to do more cleaning around the house. After about a year my girlfriend fell pregnant again (literally one drunken night having unprotected sex caused this and she forgot to get the after pill 3 days in a row.) I pleaded with her that we weren't ready for a 2nd child but she was stubborn that she was keeping it, I hated that the choice was taken out of my hands for months but I eventually looked forward to our 2nd daughter being born. 

Shes here now but now I feel I am severely unhappy and I'm now in financial difficulty, I'm wearing a mask of happiness on the outside for the sake of my daughters, I've expressed my unhappiness to my partner multiple times but she always makes it about how she's feeling. I never get 5 minutes to myself and often feel overwhelmed and have a lot of headaches now.

I should be happy with 2 beautiful amazing daughters but I can't but feel unhappy

I'm not suicidal or anything but I fear I will get to that point, does anyone have any advice? 

Am I the problem or is it my girlfriend? 

Should I break up my family for my own mental health?

Just feel lost.

Any help would be appreciated

166,"Feeling more isolated than I usually do. Typically, I can be in a room with people and still feel alone. Lately, I am alone. And I can feel it in every single part of my body. I know I’m alone and I know I need to stay alone for another week and mentally, I’m not sure how to do this :( 

Thankfully, I’m pretty much recovered from covid and had a very mild case. I’m staying inside to make sure I’m not contagious and I won’t leave my house until then. 

However, as thankful as I am that things aren’t worse, I feel so shitty knowing my mental health is taking a toll on me like this. I constantly feel like I’m going to have a panic attack. I talk myself down from it every time but it’s exhausting. 

There’s no one I can talk to about this either. Most people in my life don’t know of my anxiety, depression or even about me having covid.. So here I am. A sick loner crying on the internet.

167,"I had a panic attack over the weekend, I have social anxiety that I usually hide REALLY well.  And for the past two weekends i went camping with a big group of people. I had alot of anxiety that I didn't realize was anxiety (I thought I ate something bad, yes i know not very self aware)
On the way up to the campsite I was having alot of panic but I pushed it down and told myself to get a grip, I could do this and I wasn't letting my nervousness take over my life. I got there and all was fine until it was time to go to sleep.i just couldn't settle, my heart was beating so fast everything felt jittery and I just couldn't. I tried moving into my car to sleep. Finally at 5 am I gave up and packed, only to get my car stuck. At 7 we got my car free but by the. It was sunny as anything and everyone convinced me to stay.  The day went well, skip to the night and everything comes back, I felt nauseous and sick. The next day was weird, a mix of fun an sudden waves of panic. And finally when the sun went down I left. 

That was the breakdown, but the breakthrough was the realization that I would never do that to myself physically!! If was trying to lift something or hike somewhere and my body gave me those warning signs I would stop ASAP. I would never ignore that, but for some reason when my emotion/mential health said stop I felt the need to push though it.

And the breakthrough is that I need to respect myself and my boundaries. I view myself as a badass that can do anything, but I still know that I can't lift a car. I need to give myself the mental and emotional boundaries to say no.",29Jun2020,1
168,"I rarely post here, but Im feeling good now, since day after day, I begin to see the impact of this drug and wanted to share my experience with you. I've been taking 100mg/day for two months, first week I took 50mg/day.

I suffered from depression, SA, anxiety and intrusive thoughts with really low self esteem. Well, I still kind of do, but everything has gotten so much better and I had really zero expectations of what would become. 

The intrusive thoughts were the worst. Lets say, if I said or did something ""stupid"" at work or with friends, I would obsess over it countless times for days or months, and it felt like being mentally beaten up everyday. And some thoughts would create even more of them, it was a shitshow.

But now, I just dont really give much of a fuck now more.

Recent big problems feel smaller now, I have almost zero anxiety on some days, no intrusive thoughts at all, and I've gotten more confident, which is something really rare and special to me. My depression has also kind of faded away and I have improved mood. I mean, Im still a loner and have problems obviously but zoloft keeps them mostly out of the light. 

Im more sociable and enjoy talking to people a lot more, and It feels good just to not care about pointless stuff that was killing me all the time. The only side effects I got when starting, were slight nausea and groggines for a few days and that was that. 

I strongly recommend trying this med if you are stuck with your problems and nothing has helped so far. I hope this was useful and I'll also gladly answer any questions you have, considering the drug or anything else. DM's are also welcome.

177,"Was wondering if this has happened to anyone or if anyone has heard about it? 
My wife started Lexapro in December of 2019, first 5mg, then 10mg a few weeks later. Around February she started using medical marijuana and CBD and I noticed a change in her personality and behavior. It kind of leveled out though so I thought no big deal, however, little things that seemed maybe manic to me, kept popping up for the next couple months and then would go back away. 
She wanted to try getting off it it, and tapered her dose for about 3 weeks in May. She did a really good job tapering, exactly how her doctor told her.
At the end of May/early June things started to go down hill. Said she was in constant pain, started having big mood swings, and it went and went until yeah, it was full blown mania. She was involuntarily committed last Thursday. Super fucked up.

While i was waiting for the results i was fine and excited and worried what would happen if they rejected me, but as soon as i got the good news that i was accepted I started outright panicking every day with stupid thoughts coming to mind- what if i go there and fail classes, what if i don’t like it, get sick, don’t meet any friends... it went as far as thinking about some soo specific problems which i am aware are unlikely to happen. Suddenly i was so overwhelmed, everything became a problem and all of the good things i was looking forward didn’t matter to my brain.

Then, a couple of days ago i got the news that due to corona my first semester will be online and i’ll be doing it from home. With this news i was thinking more clearly again and started looking forward to going.

180,"We’ve all inhabited a dark place at one time or another. 

In this place you aren't living, you are only existing. 

When you inhabit this dark place, you keep it to yourself. You try your best to keep a smile. Mainly because you don’t want to feel like a burden to others. And even if you did tell someone, they truly wouldn’t understand what you are going through. 

From my personal experiences, I can say that it gets to a point where you truly feel like there is no possible way out. The light at the end of the tunnel seems non-existent.

But I want to get better. I don't want to live off anti-ds for the rest of my life (heck i'm 27!). I don't want to constantly obsess over this and that. Feel insecure over the sligthlest thing. 

So I called a new therapist, called the neurologist (any other tension-type headaches/migranes sufferes?) and booked privately (rather than through the public system) as this allows me to have an appointment in one week rather than three months.

And then they hit me with their almost EUR 100 bill  per session (and its fairly cheap actually) and I start obsessing again. Will I need to go to the therapist twice a month? More than that? If If I want to address my issues and deal with my anxiety, I will probably need to see the therapist A LOT, and regularly. Will I need to spend more on other resources to deal with headaches or migranes? More meds? And I'm lucky that the neurologist usually requires only 1/2 check ups per year.

I know money spent for your health is well spent but it's still expensive. I almost feel guilty for spending it. I haven't even met the guy yet, and I am already obessing over it. Can I actually afford this, or will I get to a point where I will need to leave it, because I can't?",29Jun2020,3

186,"Hi.

I just would like to express a thought about how I feel my hobbies and interests play an important role in my mental health. It's the comforting sense of a focused flow that I find in such interests in which I feel I function the best through. Without having the necessary downtime to pursue such interests, the tether breaks and my mind sinks into a pool of anxiety. 

This is not to suggest something dramatic, like *I am my hobbies* - But rather I do feel my hobbies and interests are vital to who I am a person, I find fulfillment in them. It frustrates me on the internet when people are quick to use the terms ""distractions"" or ""short-term relief"" when it comes to hobbies helping with anxiety. Fine, maybe I am technically distracting myself, but the point is that I do not dismiss my anxieties, I process my thoughts through journaling.

Now, there could be a much more complicated reason for this anxiety without my hobbies... I and people close to me feel it is possible that I have at least a mild case of autism. It would make sense of a number of things I struggle with, but in this specific context, it would make sense of how I pursue my hobbies with an obsessive hyperfocus. The catch is with that is I am still awaiting a more definite diagnosis for autism; I was supposed to be contacted in the ""near future""...

Anyway, please, can anyone relate to anything I have just expressed?

I was with a boy, a few years younger (me 26 he 21) but very mature in some aspects. I suffered since I was five of OCD, depression, phobias and panic attacks. I recently (last summer) was given what I think are the right medications and I'm better, I live with my mom again and not on my own but I have a job (now two) and I have very few bad days.

That being said I don't know if and when I can have kids. I don't even know if I want them, when I'm down I see the bad in the world and remember all my life wishing I could die and I don't want anyone else to suffer like me. I cannot be sure my children won't hate life and will be 100% healthy. I also am on medications (will I ever stop them?) and I know pregnancy, or life, without meds would be hell. I have emetophobia and with children would be SO tough.

A few years ago I was raped and got pregnant, that was such a roller coaster of terror, guilt and ""what if""s before and after my abortion, and that experience never really left me.

Well, he wants a family. Sooner or later. He is very family oriented. I always had a very bad family, he had a dream of a childhood. So he left me.

191,"So this is very difficult for me to talk about and i usually tend to keep it to myself but i need help this time.
So, my big brother has a mental illness which is resulted from him being treated as ""different"" in school and many other factors which led to him being unable to become a normal human being.
To elaborate more about it, my brother has been weird since he was a child ( which in my opinion is normal) but society where i life didn't like that and he was bullied alot in school. One of the most impactful events in his life was in high school when he was the only student who wasn't allowed by his fellow students to compete in a school football tournament and this was like a big turning point where my father started to realize that his son was not normal, i partially blame my dad for not being there for him and my mom also for taking literally everything he says as ""exaggeration"" but in general they are good people ... Just bad parents.
So since that time my brother was broken and wanted to commit suicide in several occasions and me being the stupid fucking kid i didn't realize at the time that he was suffering ( although i would have never been able to help since my dad painted a picture of me being this toddler since I'm 5 years younger than my brother so he never took me seriously).
You would think that this was enough for my dad to take him to a psychiatrist ,but no my dad didn't see that this was not okay.
Then came senior year in highschool which is a nightmare for everyone tbh but it was especially difficult for my brother.
My dad has always given us this idea of him being an over the top Albert Einstein so my brother aspired to be the same, but my brother isn't so bright so this year broke him again where he deliberately failed all his exams due to him losing a few marks in the first exam so that's obviously when my dad knew that my brother wasn't normal (ofcourse after shouting at him and making matters worse)
Next year he graduated from high school and moved out to college, i was so happy for him and thought that he would get better after leaving the shithole which is the school .. but little did i know that this didn't help him at all.
All what was going through his head was that he wanted to go back in time and insist on entering the football tournament and my dad being a religious man he was furious about that and saw it as blasphemy which of course as all the actions my dad takes was not the best.
After he finished college and my dad hooked him up with a job at a hotel (not his speciality but whatever i was extremely happy about it). My dad thought that the mind numbing meds the psychiatrist was prescribing and him getting a job was enough for him to be normal but it actually made matters worse because i later find out that he hates his job but acts as if he loves it just so my dad doesn't get mad at him.
Now we are here after he's been let go due to corona virus and for the first time in years we are living together (I've moved out for college as well so we didn't really live together anymore) but i can tell that he is in his worst states ever.
I just needed to talk to people anonymously about it and just see if anyone can give me advice.
Since i am a child to my parents i have no right to say anything but i intend to take care of my brother as long as i live after my parents are not here anymore and i will do my best to make him love life and feel happy.

I don't want to claim to have either as I have never been officially diagnosed, but I am really struggling to cope and have been for a really long time. 

So I visited my GP a few months ago about the anxiety as it was getting in the way of things that I wanted/needed to do, but I was just given the number of a different place that has more experience in dealing with this sort of thing.

I live near Cirencester, Gloucestershire, England and I am currently living with my boyfriend and his family. Unfortunately, as this is a rural area, bus services are scarce so I would not be able to get to Gloucester on my own.

I don't think that the money thing makes sense as this would be NHS so I would not be paying anything towards it. Because of this, I don't think that he would be willing to drive me there for this reason, and I do not want to push it. My friends either live too far away or don't drive, and I am too scared to tell them in any case. 

I have thought about asking my mum's boyfriend for help as he was very supportive when I lived at home, and he continues to support me as best as he can from a distance but this means that he will have to tell my mother and I really don't want him to as she will make it all about herself. I also cannot ask him to keep this from her as this could cause consequences for their relationship and I would never forgive myself if they split up because of me. Therefore, he is not a viable option either.

I really hate to have to ask a bunch of strangers for help, but if you live near Cirencester, Gloucestershire, England and you drive, could you help me out? Please do not reply if you don't feel comfortable because I don't want to push someone to do something they don't want to do. Also, if you were kind enough to help me, I would refund any fuel that you would have to sacrifice to driving me. Even if you can't help me in this way, advice would really be appreciated and I may not reply to all comments but I will be reading all of them. Thank you so much in advance.",29Jun2020,1
195,"Hi everyone. I hope all who read this are safe and well during this pandemic. Due to the circumstances we are in, **I am offering free facilitation of 'The Work of Byron Katie' worksheets or free informal psychological support**. Those familiar with 'The Work' and are interested in guided facilitation can freely message me personally, and in return we can relate over Skype (or a similar platform as suitable).

Such correspondence can of course be completely anonymous, and privacy and wellness of being is paramount to me.

**About me:**

For around 5 years now I have been relentlessly dedicated to The Work. I own all of Byron Katie's audio that is available to purchase (obsessive, I know!) and listen to at least an hour of content per day - and far more now during lockdown! I have listened to (collectively) thousands of hours of The Work being facilitated by Katie, and it is a never-ending path towards greater fulfilment for myself. I would sincerely love to pass this experience on for others, please feel free to message if you would be interested at all - it would truly be my privilege.

Alternatively, I greatly recommend exploring The Work of Byron Katie for free on YouTube, her podcasts online or with her copyright audio free to download: [http://web.archive.org/web/20160318085027/http://www.everypathis.org/](http://web.archive.org/web/20160318085027/http://www.everypathis.org/) . I cannot describe in words how profound an effect this material and 'The Work' has had on me.

I look forward greatly to your messages, be safe, look after family and friends - and know that there is always someone willing to listen to your situation.

All the best, and much love. ❤️

(I stress that I am not associated with Byron Katie, BKI - nor am I a certifed facilitator of 'The Work'. Instead I am volunteering my services for free due to the situation we are in, and my experience of 'The Work' being the most profound method of relieving stress, negativity, axiety, pain that I have ever experienced. I direct anyone with more urgent and serious issues to contact help lines local to your area, and thework.org has a free helpline to call, as well as certified facilitators to guide you through a worksheet.)",29Jun2020,1
196,"My confession: I feel exhausted. I'm heartbroken once again. I'm 26 and last two years I've been in four relationships, each one ended by a failure and disappointment. The last one was quite special for me, my feelings were stronger feelings than ever, I got pregnant (and then got an a., it is illegal in my country. He didn't want a child, and I always feared being a single mum). Later on, he started to do weed everyday while I was falling in depression (my dad has a terminal cancer). After breaking up I got suicidal and tried to jump from the window and hung myself when already in hospital. They are saying that I have BDP, PTSD and BPD. Triple diagnosis, quite impressive. 🤣  So: I feel there is no chance for me to find true love, nor to create a stable relationship, nor to share my life with someone valuable. It was my biggest unfulfilled dream and need in whole life to find just an ordinary love and to care mutually about someone. Lately I meet two guys, they both seem truly fascinated by me but both of them say they are not ready for a relationship. I read a lot about the Queen Elizabeth I and I identify myself a lot with her (hilarious) - sometimes I think a human should be a lonely island. I feel impossible to be loved. I invested so much energy and time for another people, and I got left with nothing. I could invest that time in learning Chinese (love it). Honestly, I have no idea why I'm writing it, I just feel very sad and have nobody to talk about it.",29Jun2020,4
197,"So in a few words, im suffering from hppd which is a secundary effect or a condition from psychedelics.

Its been two months and im still w this condition and I (18yo) never told my gf (17yo) i had this.. I feel super guilty when i am with her because i only tell her that i am suffering with anxiety and depression (which this condition is also kinda giving me).
She is totally against drugs and she knows that i dont do them.. i only used to smoke weed or cigarretes a couple times when i was w friends and it was never an addiction but if i tell her that i am like this because of mushrooms, she will probably broke up w me without thinking twice because she will be devasted, and i know this sounds a little bit excessive but im already imagining about the worst scenario.
I love her so fucking much and i did everything and did so well to be w her.. she completly changed me and she makes me feel totally loved and special.. but i am afraid that someday ill need to tell her and she will crush me.. i dont like to hide this from her but i feel like i should keep doin it.

I was surrounded by classmates at school and had parents had a family trip once a year but that's most of it, I actually didn't interact much with anybody. I never had any childhood friends never went out to play and had mild hearing loss(but problematic).

My father has NPD, my mom is totally emotional neglectful(partly due to my fathers abuse and partly due to her own shittiness). They have God complex ans are aggressive and manipulative. They never physically abused me but used to slap me frequently for totally wrong reasons. 

I can't explain it to anybody in family due to PTSD and trust issues but I had got a solution which was  totally destroyed by pandemic. I was planning to go to a therapist and then pandemic has destroyed all hope.

I am so pissed off in a way, but maybe this can be a good thing to keep me on track. It has been 3 years and 9-1/2 months since my last real drink (I don't count June 12 because I hadn't even taken any into my mouth---I basically wet my lips with my hubby's drink and that is IT) and I am struggling now. Part of me wants to say FUCK IT and just go and get drunk since I am being accused of having it in my system...but I know that isn't going to happen. I have to stay the course and stay away from alcohol. That is a BAD road to go down, friends. Believe me. I was a full-blown alcoholic before my 18th birthday and I hadn't stopped until Sept. 11, 2016...  


Anyhow, the lady called me and did my initial intake (asked me a billion questions) and I have another appointment Thursday at 2 pm to do part 2 of the process. Fuck me. I know I can resist alcohol but why does this make me feel like such a fucking failure?? I cut the other night too...I was going to cut last night but I fell asleep and didn't get a chance to do it.

210,"I don’t know if this is the right subreddit to post this in, but I was recently asking myself why I do this certain thing. I kind of just talk to myself as if I have an imaginary audience, specifically a YouTube channel. 

This started when I was probably around 7 or 8 ( I’m currently 14 ) when I collected these things called Littlest Pet Shop, or LPS for short. I had hundreds of these things, and I would play with them for hours. I got a point where I started making skits by myself, pretending that I had a YouTube channel based around these, and that I was getting subscribers and likes. I also would pretend I got hate, and I would talk to myself as if a camera was in front of me and I was addressing the hate.

I started playing video games when I was about 11, and I would pretend like I was recording my gameplay of those, too.
But as I got older and more issues arose in my life, including mental disorders, physical disorders, and family problems, I would vent to this fake audience. I told them about my cat who died. I told them about how I hated the way my mom was treating me. I told them about my dad’s cancer. Just talking to myself and kind of getting these things off my chest. I would also express my other emotions, including joy, anger, sadness, anxiousness, etc. to this make believe audience.

I don’t know if I do this because I don’t really open up to anyone, whether it be my emotions or just about myself, and it’s just a coping mechanism, or if it’s something else. I tried looking up why I do this, as it sometimes gets in the way of my everyday life ( for example, when I was told I was getting horseback riding lessons, I locked myself in the bathroom and talked to myself, even missing dinner just to speak to this audience. ) The only information I could find was ‘relief for schizophrenia’ or things along the lines of Schizophrenia, which I don’t believe I have, and I hope I don’t have.

I didnt like animation, I originally wanted fine arts, I was more into drawing and painting. My family was paying for my college,  they didn't want me to do fine arts, so we chose animation cause they thought I'd have a better chance of getting employed compared to having a fine arts degree. The school I went to isn't like the schools in america where you have to present a portfolio to get in. My school had very low standards, and mostly taught softwares more than creating art. I just ended up not liking animation 😔 I ended up not drawing and painting as much too. I try my best to improve but I get so drained I want to give up. My salary is close to minimum wage.

220,"8 years ago, a traumatic event occurred and I fell in to a really bad depression. I was hospitalized and diagnosed with chronic depression. I've been on antidepressants ever since, and I changed doses from time to time. Just recently, another similar event happened, but this time it is even worse. I am unable to be happy and I have no motivation to do anything, not even my homework. Everything I do reminds me of the thing that caused the depression to trigger. What is strange is that last week, I was so depressed, that I didn't even get up to take my medication before going to bed so I went a few days without taking them, but I didn't notice any difference honestly. It's almost like they don't work for me anymore. 

All of the coping mechanisms that aided me through my last depression don't work at all now. In fact, they make things worse. Last week I planned to kill myself. I wrote a suicide note and drove out to a bridge, but once I got to the edge, I was paralyzed and I just could not move a muscle. I had no choice but to give up and I left the suicide note in the car.

221,"Hey, im from Britain. 

Over the last two years I've been having flash backs to a memory I kept avoiding in my childhood. 

My mother used to go to the markets on the weekends, the ones that were popped up on Sunday selling fresh fruit, veg, meat, second and clothes and the like. I told here I needed the toilet so she asked one of the people who tended a shall to take me to one of those mobile bathrooms they had in the back of the stall. 

I remember peeing, then getting off the toilet. The man who directed me to the toilet, and pulled my underwear down, came back and touched both my genitals and bottom (Those are the memories I remember). I also remember him sucking me penis for a short period of time, perhaps 30 seconds. 

He then pulled up my pants and trousers, and sent me back to my mother. 


I tell you this because this memory has been eating away at me ever since I was masturbating to some fetish I had some months ago. Nothing dark; I like blowjobs. As I was flicking through the pictures I come across a graphically processed image of a smallish boy sucking a grown man's penis. I believe the genre of pornography I came over is called 'Shotacon'. It stuck this me and I've been having intrusive thoughts about it. 

Am I developing a mild form of OCD? I'm not checking myself, but I get flashbacks to that memory. It's stressful and disturbing.

223,"So I think I’ve been having OCD manifestations/symptoms? I’m kind of scared to consult a psych so I’m just posting here for some insights/advice. 

For starters, I constantly check if the doors are locked. When I pick up an item, I always have to put it back exactly how I found it or where it should be stored. I immediately have to pick up the strands of my hair off the floor the moment I spot them. I get easily bothered when my pillows are rearranged. These really don’t affect my life negatively tho so I kind of just roll with it... But the issue is I have a tendency to get obsessed w things. I could eat literally the same meal for several months and not get sick of it. When I was younger there was this show I really liked and when it ended I wrote some ~fan fiction~ just to keep the show going in some way. I’ve got a few things I think about literally everyday, and I constantly daydream. 

I’m not sure if some of these things are just forces of habit? Like do I just like routine and/or control? Is it a form of security/feeling safe? I feel like that’s plausible but I can’t really deal w the obsessive tendency, I don’t wanna be stuck w the same thoughts forever. I just don’t want it to become harmful in the long run.

I have a friend who is 28 with a borderline personality disorder. She self harms and has tried to commit suicide multiple times. One time she left a note, and her family was calling people. She went to the Golden Gate Bridge. We immediately called the police and gave a description. She sent us vague texts when we asked if she was okay. 



Then she was calling us hysterical complaining about life and her job. Her family, like mom and sister, were trying to call. My friend said we should stay on the phone with her and coax her out as long as possible.
It was traumatizing for me, I felt kind of guilt-tripped and manipulated when before we were trying to get her to therapy, but she refused. She's tried to commit suicide two times in one in half years. What is the best way to handle a suicidal person like this? Was my friend, right?",29Jun2020,2
225,"So I thought my pain would finally be over if I stepped over myself and contacted a counseling service in my country since I think I have a lot of behavioral problems and overall am really childish and horrible. I always complain and bring nothing good. 

I got an email response from the counseling service from my country and they rejected me cause my message was written in english and they told me to contact the hotline if I'm in their country (which I am) and if I'm not, contact another service.

I really don't want to call any hotlines and want to keep everything minimal and text based. I live in Ukraine and being a 14 year old there that knows how much better the world is outside of this country is a recipe for a bad life. My parents might find out that I called a hotline and I really don't want to communicate via my voice. I really don't want to do that, I'd feel worse and more worried.

227,"It didn't go well. At all. From either side of the conversation.

I've been managing symptoms for PTSD-related anxiety and bipolar disorder. The PTSD has roots in physical and emotional abuse from my dad, and also from my older brother bullying me as a child.

I've been having violent thoughts towards both of them, none of which I actually wanted to act on. I let my mom know that I will be taking time away from the family to try and manage these thought distortions, which she has communicated to the rest of the family. She and my sisters have been incredibly supportive of the decision and the process that I've undergone with therapy, the intensive outpatient program, and most recently my trip to the hospital due to a self-inflicted laceration that needed stitches on my arm. My mom visited me yesterday and I'm glad she was here. It helped. She suggested that I tell my brother why I was having violent thoughts towards him and why I wanted space from him.

I told him that I wasn't getting the support that I needed from him, I didn't think he actually took into consideration what I was saying when I was trying to find support, and that a remark he made about me not understanding the decisions that our father made when abusing us due to not having children of my own made me think he was invalidating what I was saying.

Things got heated really quickly after he responded that he doesn't know what he did for me to feel or think this way towards him, that I didn't put space between us and that I ""put us in two separate worlds"", that the situation is ""whatever"" at this point, and that he can't keep putting himself out there for something that isn't there. This angered me since I just explained in a very detailed message why I felt the emotions I felt and was trying to work thought the thoughts I was having. I told him, ""Good job making this about you. You fucking suck.""

I shouldn't have said that.

This led to a back and forth that involved him trying to shame me for the trip I took to the hospital recently, the time I've been taking away from the family, and the fact that I had placed us in ""two separate worlds"". He also attempted to use his daughter and our nephew as leverage in order to shame me again. He kept telling me that he was losing sleep over the fact that I was sent to the hospital for what I did to myself, and that I was making the rest of the family worried. He said that the only support I've given to him in the middle of his own mental health issues was the computer I gave him to get his streaming hobby going and ""some text"", which he used to refer to a back and forth that we had when he was having trouble getting some of his equipment to work together properly and felt really frustrated and depressed as a result. I just let him feel what he was feeling at the time and just let him know that this kind of a problem doesn't have to be the end of what he wants to do. I was told that the door to his home was always open and I never took advantage of that, but he hardly ever came to actually visit me unless I was having a mental health crisis. He's only ever actually bothered to visit me twice in the past 5 years.

I understand that some of my family is worried, and I've been maintaining contact with them or at least communicating with my mom that she can let others know what's going on.

The only reason I'm posting this is to say that we both got really heated really fast and trying to confront people on how you feel and what you think about the interactions that you had with them in the past isn't easy at all. Also, I have some problems with my expectations with the responses I get from these situations which is apparent by what I said to his initial response.

233,"I'm 21 years old and basically I think I have ADHD/ADD, but just never realized or at least considered the possibility of having it. But it all started this quarantine when I started noticing habits I never really thought about in the past. Things like...

\- walking downstairs to grab a cup of water, but forgetting what I was initially doing by the time I walked downstairs.

\-  walking in the bathroom to do maybe wash my hands, but I notice my reflection and decide to fix my hair (and I'll just end up not washing my hands).

\- forgetting where I leave my glasses or other important items from 30 seconds ago

\- having a really hard time on studying. my eyes often skip lines or even a whole paragraph sometimes.

\- having to reread passages multiple times to grasp its meaning.

So yea, stuff like that made me decide that maybe I should see a psychiatrist about this. However, I've been having a lot of trouble finding a psychiatrist that is covered by my insurance and honestly I've decided to just opt for the 2 most affordable ones I've been able to find. The first one, who was recommended by my PCP, costs $175 for the initial evaluation and $150 for follow-ups, meanwhile the second one that I found on my own via Psychologytoday costs $150 for the initial evaluation and $100 for follow-ups.

I'm a college student that's yet to be able to make solid money, but I've got a couple grand from stimulus checks via the government/school and also some money saved up from past part time jobs, so I'm considering seeing both and paying, but I'm not sure if that would be a smart idea, since realistically I only need to see one. I would just prefer to have multiple opinions, since I feel like mental health disorders are not always so clear cut like regular medical diagnoses.

So, in your experience do you feel like this is a good idea? Or would I just be spending money when I don't need to? Sorry for making such a long post for a simple question, but I appreciate any advice I can get. Thank you!",29Jun2020,1
234,"So last night my mom came into my room while I was having a huge mental breakdown. Then we had some convo which resulted in her forcing me to her preferred physiatrist.  

(Note: i have went to psychiatrist secretly which was helping me a bit as he referred therapy to me and was going to start med after some months into therapy. Therapy was helping a bit to me. I suffer from depression,anxiety,and attention problems from past 2 years)


So next day opposed to what I thought that I was going to a psychiatrist it was actually me, my mom dad and my elder sister. The physiatrist was an old man around 68-75 years old and he specialized in dealing with old people(I am 16 m). Now my family are the ones worsening my mental health issues. Also knowing my mother I was sure tha whatever I told the guy would also reach my family and as a result i was not open about my symptoms and feelings to him. 
I was meeting him for the first time so i could not establish trust with him. Also because such a big age gap between us and the age group he specialised he could not relate to me. So the conversation lasted only 20 min and that too while my mom was sitting beside me all the time which was also the reason I didn't open up.
Just base on that 20 min conversation he prescribed me meds.  
My previous psychiatrist whom i had been seeing for past two months and was working on me along with a therapist was telling me to wait for meds as i may not need them. My therapist and psychiatrist who knew me and my condition well were waiting to know more about my condition and to make things better by therapy as far as it was possible (my psychiatrist suspects that i suffer from adhd-pi, generalized anxiety disorder and depression; he only diagnosed my for depression as he waiting to be sure to avoid misdiagnosis) were taking so long to diagnose me and to prescribe meds.  

But this guy(mom's preferred physiatrist for me) talked to me for less than 20 min while my mom was also sitting there and somehow diagnosed me with bpd, schizophrenia, anxiety and depression in the first meeting with him and that too in just 20 minutes.    

This makes me doubt taking the meds he prescribed. I also searched about them online and found out some of them cause suicide thoughts (i am already suicidal)and some severe side effects as change in personality. All this makes me feel to not take any of his prescribed meds. But from next day my family is going to push me to start them.  

I know I need help but i am not feeling comfortable in using them. What should i do ?   

The pills he prescribed:   

Tolaz MD 2.5

Nexito plus

Also how to convince my family about me not being comfortable with the meds ?",29Jun2020,1
235,"Ever since i can remember my mum has always had problems with my father she constantly said he was crazy. They would fight he would disappear for days comeback and repeat the cycle but when he would look after me when she was away he was amazing funny friendly genuinely felt like a great dad. im the youngest of four children and my older brother and sister wee always out and didn't really take much notice I guess they already lived through the same situation while growing up. 

A few weeks after my 10th birthday and my mum breaks news that my father is in a mental hospital diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. He had went to his mums house to save her from something unknown and carried her up and down the street until someone noticed and called for help. I always felt terrible knowing this and shortly after he passed away.

From then on i just tried to remember the good times and felt like its never really effected me. Im now 25 and out of nowhere I've started having really bad intrusive thughts the kind i would rather not describe. At first i would just try to think about something else telling myself it must be from a film I've watched. Months after this started and they've got worse i found myself shouting out random words as a method to drown out the thoughts.. as i caught myself shouting out with my hand over my eyes i suddenly remember dad. I cant escape the feeling like I'm gradually going crazy and the paranoia about having a similiar disorder is now eating me from the inside out.

I'm feeling terrible, but I don't know what it is or what the reason is. I think very negatively. Every time I walk outside, there are about 100 (negative) things at a time that crosses my mind: ''what will that person think of me? Why does she look so good? I'm so ugly. You cant achieve it. Look at that beautiful girl, she looks so nice. You're such an idiot''. This crosses my mind every single minute  I am outside. 

When I'm at home, there is still the negative spiral/cycle due to the relationship with my parents.

I feel lonely; I do have some friends, and I really like them, but  I can't talk to them about these kinds of things and we don't share the same interests.

Cut to the chase.
Had a rocky start and made all the wrong decisions.

Since nov 2018 (18 not 19) I've been exhausted

I've been doing my exams as well as going to a military prep course (no fitness their it's just for my b-tech)

as well as doing boxing: monday - thursday
(Running on wednesday)

Body building after boxing: monday to thursday

I'm also doing a few secret things and a tiny bit of cinematography


And I'm very introverted and make a constant effort to hide behind a mask with friends and family

Some of these secret things are illegal (not very illegal) but I'm doing them for myself. And my friends  I've had over 10 very close calls over the past year and a half and it's Very Very Stressful and Worrying


( This Has Essed up since Lockdown )
But I'm still very fatigued


Here's The Problem

So I'm so sick and tired. I constantly find myself talking to the voices in my head.

I don't feel real. Or sometimes very different like people are trying to trick me into believing I'm normal

I'm very angry. I want to yell out at my family but that'll destroy my characters

I'm always worrying. Always depressed. Always on the fucking tipping point


BUT

I can't stop studying for my GCSE's for another year

I can't loose my B - tech
I have no close friends or anyone to talk to
I'm 15 and only earn £10 a week
I'm trying to quit smoking to join the uk army
I have so many problems on top of this
My dad won't let me stop weights or boxing
I'm worried right now

I hate everything I do currently

I feel like I'm missing stuff to mention but that's it

240,"I'm a naturally anxious person, especially when it comes to health conditions. Over time I've mostly been able to get my anxiety under control, but certain things can really get me wound up. An event like what happened earlier today for instance. 

I was standing playing a video game, I had a little bit of a tickle on my leg so I looked down and out of my peripheral I saw what appeared to be a big large bug (I assumed a spider) crawl really fast to the edge of the piece of furniture and out of sight. When I looked on the other side there was no bug. I looked around some more and rather quickly concluded there was no bug at all. I didn't really have a chance to see it clear in my vision, only that it was dark/black and appeared to be crawling. It was in my frame of vision for a second or two at most. 

Should I be worried about this? Has something like this happened to anyone else? I recall a moment a week or two ago when I briefly thought I saw a bug on me outside after feeling looking down because I felt a pinch. It seemed as if there was no bug then either (though I couldn't confirm on that occasion). Very similarly, I could never clearly see the bug, just the vague outline of something crawling away for a brief moment. The fact that this occurred even in relative proximity to each other is all it takes for my anxiety to latch onto it.

As an aside, other than my anxiety, my health is overall good aside from a back problem that's causing some sciatica that radiates down my right leg (likely the cause of both the tickle and the pinch I felt). Any personal stories or affirmation that I probably shouldn't be worried about this would be great, thanks to anyone who chooses to reply.",29Jun2020,1

246,"So I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this, and I'm not sure if I'm asking for advice, I just need to get this out.

My anxiety has been really bad the past few days/week. It's been kind of bad since lockdown in March, but this past week it's been really bad, to the point where I've had chest pains and real difficulty breathing. I knew that part of this anxiety was due to lockdown easing here (Scotland) but masks being required on public transport. 

Because of the way anxiety affects me, I often forget to take breaths, and when I do they're quote shallow. Having anything covering my mouth or nose, or around my neck like a scarf, makes my anxiety worse.

I think I've just realised that my anxiety is so much worse recently because I have to get a bus to get my prescription for depression and anxiety. I can't wear  a mask on the bus, I'll start hyperventilating. I think I'm also anxious and nervous about people calling me out on it, and trying to ask me why I'm not wearing a mask. I can't deal with confrontation, especially when I'm in a mess like I am at the moment. I think I'm more scared of going on a bus now than I was when COVID was worse, just because I'm terrified of someone losing their mind at me.

252,So I'm about to start EMDR and had to do a dissociative screening. Overall while looking at the answers I realized just how little of my life is spent outside of some for of dissociation. Of course I can't speak for what I don't remember. Which is most of my life. I'd say I remember maybe a years worth of my life at most. And ironically enough while filling out the form I started dissociating. The last thing I clearly remember is sending the email of the form. It's been about 3 hours since then. But the thing is the last time I really admited to how I view my life and experience things to a therapist I was told I was probably exaggerating because I seemed perfectly functional. And although I want to be proud of that it hurt to hear that all the work I've put into being perceived as normal may make it so I can't get help. I have reminders about small things around my room. I made my room a space that doesn't upset any side of me. I have things from all points in my life as reminders. I made myself stare down my own hallucinations till I can find little ways they don't look real. I've invested so much in cleaning and hygiene that even a little bit of disarray in those departments us enough to let me know I've been in a bad place and I force myself through the motions. I've done it for longer than I remember and hearing that it makes me seem like I'm exaggerating things and that I can't get a diagnosis because of it is just too much to deal with again. I'm honest with me feelings and functioning didn't help any of my issues go away. It just helped me blend in with society. This new therapist seems to be willing to take me seriously and I sure hope she is because if I hear that again I don't know what I'll do. I probably won't be able to stay collected again.

253,"Hello, I have a question and I'm not really sure what sub it's for, so I'm posting on several subs.

My cousin is a 31 y/o guy (for reference, I'm 29 y/o guy). He had a few-month relationship with a girl about 8 years ago, but not any other relationship that we, as his family, know of. His brother is really close to him, and he doesn't know either. He broke up with that girl because ""she was too indecisive and doesn't know what she wants"" - they were, like, 23+/- at the time. Anyway, before that relationship and after it, he never wanted to talk about dating and relationships, he'd always deflect or bluntly say ""I don't want to talk about it"", or even lashed out ""why are you asking me? I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT!"". He's usually very stubborn and is often very loud in discussions. He and I are not too distant, but neither too close. Most of our talks are about movies or TV shows, or food, cars, computers and other ""guy stuff"", but never about girls and relationships, because of the reasons above. We tried asking, several times, often very gently. I am in a very serious relationship, we are engaged. He met my girl, and I was hoping, enticed by my relationship and engagement, he might open himself a bit, but he didn't budge. Throughout my whole life, he's extremely emotionally closed.

We're all worried about him from that perspective, well, not *worried*, but curious. I, his cousin, am getting married, most of his friends are already married, the rest of his friends are in longer or shorter relationships, all pretty normal. But he, he lives as if that component doesn't exist in his life. (His brother is similar, but he's had a very serious relationship ~3 years ago. She moved far away and ended it because of the distance)

I talked to his mom and dad, and we don't know what to think. We thought doesn't he feel a need to connect with someone? Emotionally, mentally, physically? Sexually? Is he gay? Is he in the closet and can't admit to everybody he's gay? Maybe he can't admit to himself? But he never gave even slightest inclines towards guys. We thought, is he maybe asexual? A few years ago, I looked for (yeah, I know, privacy... But he doesn't know I did, and I never told anyone I did) and I found actually some porno images of girls on his PC, but very soft porn, i.e. only images of naked girls posing.

He and the whole family is one of those ""religious but not really practicing"" families (usual Texan...), and not closed, but also not open to someone being gay. I'm excluding myself because I'm the black sheep of the family as far as that goes, i.e. atheist, open-minded, accept everyone, ...

I tried once to introduce him to psychological therapies, more like counseling, to help him find out what he wants in life, but he completely ignored that, and I didn't want to push.

So what do you people think? Can someone shed some light on my cousin? Because we, the closest to him, are baffled. I mean, we leave him be, but we're curious since he's in his 30s and never had a meaningful relationship. I'm guessing he may still be a virgin. I mean that's ok. We're just curious. He's not ugly and he's not stupid, he *could* get a girlfriend (or a boyfriend). Could he just be very shy?

In other aspects of his life he's very friendly, very reliable and dependable, likes ""manly-guy"" stuff like cars and guns and such stuff (movies like Fast and furious and Transformers, ...). During Corona time he dug out our old Lego box and is reassembling Lego from childhood, says it's fun and he likes Lego.

I don't really ever really feel euphoric. It's always tinted through a lack of meaning and just genrral sadness. I don't know why I'm sad most of the time. Everything is so inevitably temporary, so I don't know why I should even try to achieve anything. 
Maybe I'm too sober. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't eat meat, I rarely drink coffee and I don't fall in love. 
I've been called an antihuman for that, which is kind of funny. 
Actually I do care, not really about the things in my life, but about the universe, nature, humanity in its entirety. But there is basically nothing I can do about these things. At last they are all temporary too.
There is no job I really want. I don't have a dream. Even if I habe a dream for a day it's tinted grey on the next day. I used to not see myself get any older than 23. I actually had a really specific thought of how exactly I would die. Not caused by me, just by an accident. At the moment I just pick the things I think I might like and use them as a motivation to even try anything. It works, but it's not being true to myself.
 
If you read this far thank you. Also I just wanna say that I know I kind of sound like the ""I'm not like other people"" stereotype, or like the classic egotistical outsider. Oh well.",29Jun2020,1

268,"I’ve had a really rough past few days and have started going back to bad, old habits. I mostly just feel really guilty and sad.

I have trust issues, but when I do finally start trusting someone I get really attached because I’m lonely. My bestfriend stopped talking to me last night because I found some old gcs where he was pissed off about me friendzoning him. He said some pretty not nice things, but he was also upset so I get it.

I sat down at the table and my parents started asking why I haven’t left the house and a few days and I explained the situation. They said I was too trusting of people and I was too nice (which I’m really not, it’s just how they see me ig). Anyways, this conversation turned into a “I don’t know how you are going to survive in college because you don’t have any street smarts” and then eventually that they were worried I could get myself into a bad situation and get raped or something.

I was tuning them out because I really just wanted to eat my food and go take a nap. Plus, they were basically gaslighting me and saying I couldn’t do anything myself and how I always fucked everything up. They realized I wasn’t really listening so one of them brought up a really shitty and personal thing that happened in my past which I have pretty bad PTSD about and I fucking lost it. I got really pissed and upset and had a full fledged panic attack at the table. I was being really dramatic, but honestly I was so pissed off and upset that they would do that. 

Then they were like “you have no reason to be upset” and “we brought up that to get your attention” and “we don’t want history to repeat itself” like what in the fuck is wrong with you. Then they wouldn’t let me leave the table until I stopped crying. 

Everything is so fucking bad right now. I don’t have anyone to ask for help. I’m becoming anorexic again, I’m starting to have panic attacks every night, I can’t sleep. No one fucking cares. None of my friends check up on me. I honestly just want to die.",29Jun2020,5

So I cut for like a week and then stopped. I kinda liked it but I didn’t want the scares and I found it much more effective and less damaging physically to just smoke weed. However I feel like I faked the whole thing. I think I did it because I convinced myself i’m depressed even though i’m actually not and I did it because that’s what depressed people are “supposed to do”. But why would anyone want to be depressed? I think maybe I just kinda use it as an excuse to myself as to why i’m lazy and unmotivated.

273,"I was assaulted once by a very trusted family member,and once while i slept by a friend.I do not trust a single man after these events and i can't sleep if my door isn't locked and i'm not alone,one of my biggest fears is being assaulted while skeeping again and ending up pregnant since abortions are illegal here.I just can't do it, no matter how tired, i get hypervigilant and need to be facing the door.I also do not trust doctors or nurses due to how they handled my anxiety and depression in the past.

I'm in therapy because of this + emotional neglect.These fears are not getting better and i would like to discuss them with my therapist, but i'm extremely anxious because:

1.It's paranoid behaviour, and if he decides to put me on a psych ward no one will vouch for me.

2.He's a man, even if he seems empathetic, when i tried to share about my fear of pregnancy and losing control i felt dismissed because he tried to link it to me not liking my family. I don't know if he will be receptive, think i'm exaggerating or dismiss me again.

I don't think i can survive a psych ward experience. I have been to one to visit a friend and i would be forced to lose any control, sleep in the same room as someone else, sleep while male nurses and staff can get in at anytime and not be able to change or have any privacy. I would never shake off the feeling that i might have been assaulted while i slept and not known it, specially because they drug you if you don't sleep. And it might sound bad but i'm terrified of the men who would be locked up with me, i already don't trust completely normal men, much less one who is mentally unstable.

And i absolutely hate being at the mercy of nurses and doctoes from other bad experiences too. I avoid going whenever i can and aways take someone with me.

So yeah, my trauma now would be null if compared to what i would be going through if forced to be in a psych ward.

And my therapist has the power to make this happen, it's my word against his, so i'm not trustinr him with this and tell him that my anxiety hasn't been so bad.

I want to get better, but i feel like i won't be able to if i don't adress this, but fear all this i said above. I don't know what to do or ir it will ever get more bearable.",29Jun2020,1
274,"My partner and i have both been struggling with productivity. We are both diagnosed with depression and anxiety. My partner has gone almost 2 weeks doing nothing for his work from home job. Ive been heavily procrastinating too. Ive neglected a work assignment for about a week. We are both doing jobs that aren't exactly what we want, but we find meaning in them and think theyre important.  Its not just work. Chores, errands, getting out of bed...everything is hard. Neither of us care about our hobbies. Were stuck in a long distance thing and can only comfort eachother to a degree. The only time we feel joy is when we video chat. I find myself laying paralyzed thinking how much i have to do and how i suck for not doing it. Is depression sometimes an excuse to be lazy? How can you tell if youre depressed or lazy? How can you make yourself productive?",29Jun2020,1
275,"*\*I have spent the better part of a year thinking about unconditional love, and how to have that with boundaries. It's been a very confusing part in my growth. Recently though, I had a very enlightening realization about this topic and have put together some words to share on my blog, and thought to share this here. \**

It’s hard choosing yourself. Choosing yourself means not choosing someone you love sometimes. Choosing yourself feels like you are creating conditions that you didn’t want to have. But unconditional love is a funny thing.

I have always felt that loving someone unconditionally meant being able to look past their flaws, toxic or not. Most of us think that looks like having compassion for the person and not holding them accountable to their toxic behavior. What ends up happening though is we internalize their behavior towards us rather than create a boundary because not holding them accountable feels like an expression compassion and love. However, loving someone this way actually creates conditions. Additionally, the style of compassion is enabling and ego based. For example, if they became frustrated and upset with feelings I was verbalizing, I’d make it about me, leaving me riddled with guilt. “Man I wish I wasn’t so sensitive and anxious.” But of course when you do that you become increasingly not ok, and eventually resentment kicks in. Resentment says, “I wish they were a certain way.” Wise compassion says “I am ok that they are this way, but I need to set some boundaries.” When we start to feel like we wish someone was a certain way, thats when the conditions start to develop, moving us from unconditional love to conditional. 

Depending on your needs as a person, you can look at these issues and find boundaries to establish to help relieve the resentment. Say you have a friend. You’ve built a part of your friendship on sharing your feelings, but maybe you both reached a stage where talking to them about your feelings is no longer helpful because their words don’t feel supportive. You may have grown with more emotional intelligence, or they may be in a place in their life where supporting someone else’s feelings triggers their own. Deciding to not go to them to talk about your feelings would be setting a boundary. While they may be the one displaying unhealthy behaviors towards you, trying to maintain that aspect of the relationship is creating conditions on loving them. The more we attempt to do things that aren’t working, the bigger the wedge gets. It’s not ones fault, it’s just how humans work. However, knowing that, we can create lasting relationships that are healthy for everyone doing the the relating.",29Jun2020,2
276,"I wasn't sure where to post this, so tell me if there's a better subreddit. I have a few twitches that I've noticed, if they're called that. It's more like an urge to do something than an involuntary action. Like twitching my lower eyelid/cheek. The one that's most annoying for me though, is looking over my right shoulder. I just keep getting the urge while I'm sitting at my desk to look over my shoulder, at my bed behind me, or sometimes it's not at far, and just to look at something in front of me through the nose on the edge of my vision. It can make my neck ache, and my back if I keep looking all the way around. I'm not really sure what causes it, Anxiety, or OCD maybe? It's not like I'm making sure I'm alone or safe or anything, I do it when I'm watching a movie with family, etc too. Any advice, or at least a name for this?",29Jun2020,1
278,"So my nan died when I was 11 and my mum is massive social anxiety. Where she has full on episodes when stressed and starts blaming everyone for her problems and then starts making excuses and belittles herself out loud like “I can’t help, you do it.” For an example and gives an unrelated reason why like “I’ve got a headache” even if the excuse is unrelated and she has severe trauma from her mother as well. 
My dad kinda gets depressed, not in an bad way, he just sighs and is on his phone a lot and plays video games on the 360. This triggers mum with more complaining that they don’t talk but dad de stresses when he plays games and usually it’s from her as a reason.  

My parents has becoming suffocating at times and they have stressed me out since nan died because after 11 I was mature enough to understand people. I’ve always thought I was rebellious for crying after mum started blaming me for things and belittling me around the age of 13. Or when I was mad she would tease me with “oh you are such a teenager” even though it was a simple request to stop being loud. 

Like, my parents are great and loving most of the time, now at 18 almost 19, I really need to push my mum is go see a psychologist for her anxiety for the better health of the family. Thing is, I don’t know how without offending her because she is really defensive with her problem and think she is fine.",29Jun2020,1
279,"trigger warning ⚠️ for mention of rape, sexual assault, alcohol 

13-16 years old is when my trauma is based around.
my mum and dad divorced when i was younger but it only started to effect me years later as i was older enough to understand and my dad stopped wanting to see me out the blue, i got trauma based on alcohol as a result since my dad was a alcoholic and i would see him act in ways no child should see.
i also got r*ped at 13 which was my first sexual experience and my last as of now, i’ve never done anything sexual with anyone else ever since and of course it gave me sexual trauma, which although it happened 5 years ago, still effects me to this day. it’s the only thing i never go into detail/speak about with anyone. 
i also got heavily bullied in high school which resulted in me developing manic depression and low self esteem.
i was also s*xually assaulted by a boy from my high school in year 8.
i started to develop paranoid disorder, anxiety and a eating disorder including body dysmorphia due to all of this happening in my life and i started to s*lf h*rm to cope. it was only a matter of time until people found out and i was took to be sectioned by my mum and that’s when i started to go to therapy ( twice in my life ), doctors appointments and working with camhs which is fucking shit btw. 
whilst that was happening i also got diagnosed with autism which at the time i didn’t want to believe.
i also only came to terms with being groomed and manipulated by a man online a couple of months ago but it started it when i was 13, still trying to recover from it. 

all of this i have spoken about at some point but never on a public platform and never in much detail like this. this has took a lot for me to open up about.

I dumped my boyfriend, the only person who cared about me in real life, because i dont like him sexually anymore. He rightfully doesnt want to speak to me now. I also have hurt the person I love the most. She is dealing with withdrawals and asked me to not to reply, i got scared and i stayed silent as i read while she later had a breakdown.

282,"My friend thinks this is insane but i can’t handle the pressure of making decisions so I always ask the universe for its input by asking it for specific signs.

I base most of the decisions in my life on this imaginary betting system with the universe and apparently it’s not normal?? should i take more responsibility for my decisions like my friend said i should? I mean it hasn’t really let me down yet and i’m pretty okay with where i am in life but I do leave everything down to chance. 

The thing that made my friend most concerned is that I broke up with my boyfriend for no reason other than I was given rice with my dinner, not because I wanted to. I wasn’t unhappy in the relationship, I just felt it might be going stale. I was devastated and my friend asked my why and that’s when i told her about my system.

290,"There is a woman in my life who is fighting depression and has been her whole life. She is 19 and claims to have some chemical imbalance in her brain(also thinks it maybe be bipolar personality disorder). This makes her believe that she can't do anything, that its something she will live with her whole life. So I have a few questions for this community to answer. One, does birth control and Accutane affect your chemical imbalances? Lately, she has been having her moments, she becomes quiet, frustrated, and lacks the energy to get out of bed even with me around!? I may be the problem and that is what she claims is going on but I promise to everyone here its not me bc I see the same behavior when she is around others. So then I come to my second question which is how to persuade her to go see someone? The first problem is she won't ever talk to anyone about her problems so therapy won't ever happen or receive the right drugs (which I don't recommend) because of her stubbornness to talk to someone. So I'm stuck she hates her life, she wants to die, she isn't ever happy and her family knows it and I know it but we can't do anymore so any other last suggestions would be great. Thanks! Also if anyone else goes through similar issues of being agitated easily, having a chemical imbalance, or even BPD, please comment suggestions that help because I understand its not something to just cure but anything helps.
