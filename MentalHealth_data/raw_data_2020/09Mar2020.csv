0,"I don't know what it is. I've searched for hours and hours, and I can't find anything. For some reason, I get really uncomfortable if I don't rub my arm or wrist across something, or move my foot in a certain direction, or something like that. At first it was just something little that I occasionally had to do. But it's been getting worse over the years. I'm a big gamer, so using my mouse is literally impossible now. Even typing is hard because my right forearm has to touch the laptop itself, so that messes me up. I also have to flex my thumb a lot, and that messes me up when I'm trying to text someone on my phone. I try to play on my ps4, but I have to move my palm across the controller multiple times in a row before I can even continue playing. Same thing with my mouse. I don't know what to do anymore. It's been getting so bad lately, it's hard to do anything that requires precision or attention. I don't even consider playing videogames anymore, because it's almost impossible to play because of whatever this is. I seriously need to find out what this is, because it's ruining my life.",09Mar2020,1
1,"It doesn't matter if things get better. The past is always going to be there. My personality is only going to be there. I'm always going to be disgusted by my body, my voice, my eyes, my dark skin color, and every other terrible, awful thing about myself.

I just don't want to be me. Everyone else is just so much better. They get people romantically interested in them, they have people reaching out to them ***wanting*** to be their friends, they have personalities that draw others and cause them to be liked by professors and others and just ugh. I'm just the worse. The fact that I'm alive is something I feel the need to apologize for. I'm adopted and was never meant to be born, and boy would the world be much better without me.

I was always the good kid who kept his head down and did his work. Now I'm just a boring pushover. A creepy, unlikable piece of shit who can't ever achieve anything he wants.

2,"TL;DR: I think it’s possible that I may have borderline personality disorder because of symptoms/issues I’ve dealt with for the last 5+ years.

Hi everyone. I’m new to reddit so please let me know if this isn’t the right area to post.

I’m 18 (F) and have previously attended counselling for mixed anxiety and depression, panic disorder and chronic anxiety (the diagnosis I was given). We mainly talked about how my anxiety affected my daily life, we spoke about my abusive father during my childhood, and overall it helped me. However I didn’t speak about any other issues I had been experiencing, mainly because I didn’t recognise that they were issues until recently.

These issues have been detrimental to my mental health and my wellbeing over the period of about 4-5 years. I identify them with a lot of symptoms of BPD however seeking medical attention has always been really hard for me. I don’t like to admit that I’m all fucked up I suppose.

The first problem I have: unstable friendships/ relationships with family. My romantic relationship is fine, it’s actually the most stable relationship I’ve had my whole life. I’ve been with my S/O for two years, with some bumps but I’ll get to that later. I don’t have much of a relationship with my father because he was physically and emotionally abusive towards me throughout my childhood. I’ve never felt that he loves me but I’ve come to terms with that. Every time I make friends with someone, it’s great for a few months, and then my opinion of them will continually change until I inevitably end the friendship. I always end up regretting it because I know I act out of impulsivity, and ultimately it hurts me more than anyone. This always happens. Additionally, I’m always idealising people, strangers, friends, family. I’m extremely hurt by the idea that my fantasies of these people could be wrong. I’m always devestated when I find out that they aren’t anything like a imagined. 

I have extreme problems with containing anger at times. The slightest inconvenience will make my blood boil. People not reading my messages, not answering phone calls, people bumping into me at the train station, etc. it makes me way angrier than it should and I’ve always known it’s an issue. Recently my s/o and I got into two arguments, both a week apart. It ended with me screaming like a fucking bat or something and bawling my eyes out. It was totally out of order and came out of nowhere.

My moods are constantly fluctuating. On my bad days. I wake up feeling happy, but I gradually get worse and worse throughout the day, finding myself getting angrier and more depressed until I end up shutting everyone off. I used to self harm when things like this would happen, I’ve stopped recently but I struggle sometimes. I’ve thought about killing myself more times than I could count, it frequently pops into my head throughout the day. I catch the train a lot and I always imagine myself jumping in front of a train, or I research ways to overdose. I’ve never gone through with it because I’m scared of the pain. 

Impulsivity is a problem I’ve had. I say and do things out of impulse because in my mind it’s justified. If someone has ‘pushed’ me to feel a certain way, intentional or not, I will lash out and I won’t feel remorseful for it at the time. But I always regret it. Like I said I have also impulsively harmed myself in moments of extreme anger and depression. But I’ll wake up the next day feeling happy and fine.

Last but not least, I have issues with finding my own identity. I try to find identity in things like studying, wearing new clothes, listening to new music. Nothing works, and when it doesn’t I feel so empty inside. I feel empty when I treat people I care about like total shit, and the reason I’ve noticed that this is a problem, is because I want it to stop. I want to change, or get help. I think pinning it down to anxiety or depression was a stupid thing because I know there’s an underlying problem. I can’t find identity in anything, and I have zero self confidence. I know I’m young but I should have some sort of idea of who I am. I’m utterly clueless as to what role I have in this world. I think that if I have a baby or get married, that will give me a purpose. But it’s unrealistic and foolish of me to think that. 

Be honest but try to be understanding. I know this is horrible to read but I would never intentionally hurt people I love, physically or emotionally. These are patterns of behaviour I’ve always had, and I want to break the habit. I’m not sure if it’s BPD but I want to get a second opinion.
Thanks :)",09Mar2020,1

4,"Hey all. 

I realize this is not ideal but in the past few years I’ve been taking lamictal I’ve been experiencing scary side effects. Once I took it to early (meant for bedtime) and I couldn’t walk. I was so dizzy I couldn’t even crawl. My boyfriend had to carry me into the bedroom and put me on the bed. I freaked out all night and was only slightly better in the morning. I took myself off it. 

I’ve been trying to be better and take it again in smaller doses, building back up with the help of my doctor. However -every morning when I wake up I feel like my throat is closing up and feel like I can’t breathe. I’ve brought this up to both my therapist and psychiatrist and they suggest I’m having a food allergy. 

I also feel like I don’t know what my eyes are doing sometimes. Like sometimes when I’m looking around I feel like my eyes are protruding or my pupils are super dilated. They’re not but it’s strange. 

Has anyone ever had a similar reaction with this script?",09Mar2020,1
5,"Everyday, I feel like life becomes less and less worth living. I can't stand school; I'm so over it. My classes assign to much work, but I feel obligated to do well on the assignments. This weekend I spent a majority of my time doing homework. I'm tired all the time because I have to stay up late to complete everything. Just today I got nostalgic for when I was younger, when I didn't need to worry so much, when I could just watch cartoons or play video games, when I had some friends, when I played outside, when I didn't have some stupid, fucking AP Chem notes to finish. Everything is getting worse. I can only waste so many days doing homework before I just quit everything. I'm worried that I'm going to reach a breaking point soon.",09Mar2020,1
6,"Likely to protect myself, my brain has just...given up on emotions for the whole of my life. I'm twenty, and as a kid, I had some *shit* things happen. To cope, I basically became a brick of a person. But now I'm seeing a therapist, and I'm beginning to explore feeling things.

And I *fucking hate it.*

I used to feel anxiety, and anger. Anger, I could shove down (similarly to what I'm doing with the rest of my emotions, I assume). But anxiety was always there, ready to pounce.

Now, I'm talking about things that happened. Things I don't *want* to explore. And I hate it. I hate feeling paranoia, and anger, and frustration, and depression, and so much more. It's overwhelming. Even the good things I'm feeling more, but it's *so much to feel*.

Deadass. This might sound stupid, or like I'm a goddamn AI who is becoming human, but it's true. It's overwhelming, and exhausting, and while I like the good stuff, I'm *terrified* of the bad things.

And the thing is, is that it'll keep getting ""worse"". We've only *just* began to discuss things. It'll only become more and more intense.

I don't know what to even do...",09Mar2020,1
7,"TL;DR I’m having weird symptoms and I’d like to know what’s going on with me
To give you background information, I’ve been a drug user for almost 2 years, I’m a 18 yo male, I tried almost every drug you can think of but only a couple of times, the regulars are only hash and pregabalin, now I don’t know how long this issue has been going on for because i used to always be high which covered up the symptoms, but I realized how bad it is when I became kinda sober, I used to smoke almost all day and take lyrica a couple of times a month which became a couple of times a week in my last couple months of abuse. Now I’ve been sober from lyrica for around 2 months but I still occasionally smoke hash to relieve my symptoms. I have all the physical symptoms of anxiety and the most prominent ones are goosebumps, sweating hands and feet, and jittery feeling, the weird thing is these symptoms go away when I’m sitting in a restaurant or when I’m sitting on the toilet, but when I get in bed, my hands and feet start sweating and I get goosebumps, the symptoms worsen during stressful occasions, I’ve been to the top psychiatrist in my city and he suspected it’s anxiety caused by drug abuse and he prescribed me flupentixol for two weeks and told me to see him if I don’t feel better, after two weeks of no improvement I went and I saw him and he prescribed me escilatopram, he said he could not give me a clear diagnosis because I don’t have all the symptoms of anxiety. Idk what to do I can’t take this; every night I wake up several times from embarrassing dreams soaked in sweat and the sheets are drenched in sweat, I’m suspecting it is social anxiety worsened by drug abuse. This has been going on for at least 3-4 months but i didn’t feel it until now because I almost completely stopped my drug use. I want to know what’s wrong with me and why do these symptoms go away when I’m sitting on the toilet but come back when I lay back in bed??",09Mar2020,1
8,"I’m the type of person who most people come to when they want to tell their problems or ask for an advice and I am happy to help them. I always go out of my way to help them and I devote a lot of my time and energy into helping them. I am always there and and answer them even if it’s early in the morning and I need to sleep.
   But when it comes to me, I rarely go to someone for help because I don’t want to come off as annoying or to disturb them from what they’re doing so I just hide it away and hope it just dies eventually. Even if , for example, I am saving money to buy myself something I’ve been wanting for sooo long, I just go and get something for someone close to me because I know they’ve been wanting it or even dreaming about it. I feel happy that I can do that to someone but when it comes to me I feel selfish. 
   I am so used to hiding my problems and my pain away that I find it hard even talking face to face about it with the only person close to me. I feel selfish and that I make them feel bad if I start pouring out. I may be overthinking this but I finally feel just a little better saying all of this, even if maybe no one will read it.

9,"I know I can't ask for a diagnosis online and that I should go to a doctor or therapist for these issues. However, I feel like I'm going insane and just want to know if anyone has this issue and if so do you have a diagnosis yourself?

I moved from a very sunny country to the UK and experienced extreme seasonal affective disorder. I didn't see the sun for two months at one point and it took an immense toll on my mental health. I would sleep for mere hours before heading to class. Couldn't properly bathe and clean my room. Skipped lectures and left social events 30 minutes in.

Now that it is getting sunny again, I am a completely new person. I feel like myself. I'm going on dates. My grades are awesome. The only thing is... one random day a week I get a crippling wave of depression. I can actually feel it coming - usually the night before. I start to get lethargic, have negative thoughts, immediately curl up in bed and sometimes cry. Then the next day I can't leave my room. I usually spend all day under my covers not eating; too sad to even turn on my phone. Then the next day I am completely normal.

This day comes at random. Sometimes on Monday. Sometimes Thursday. It doesn't matter. I'm only typing this now because it's happening right now and I just want to know if this is normal for getting over seasonal affective disorder or like... something completely random? Once again, I know no one can diagnose me but any input is appreciated!

**tl;dr:** Getting over seasonal affective disorder and one random day a week I get hit with crippling depression. Just need advice. I will see a doctor/therapist for it.",09Mar2020,1

11,"Hi there-- my most recent bout of depression in going on into month 6 and the biggest thing that is breaking me down is insomnia. I've never had it this bad. I haven't had more than 5 hours/night for months (with the average being 3 hours), even with a couple of work-related all-nighters in December. I see my therapist on Wednesday and I'm trying to find a doctor to talk to (even though our insurance is crap and one appt will cost $200+ out of pocket to just \*talk\* about a sleep study), but wondered what anyone else has done to silence the voices. It's a sinister combination of anxiety about work projects and a never-ending cycle of self-abuse over all my missteps and failures just reminding me of how I've failed to live up to myself and how I just need to give up. These are the things I've already tried:

\-Reset after an all-nighter (they do this in clinics)

\-Listen to meditation and sleep hypnosis YouTube videos (Michael Sealey)

\-Listen to the Sleep with Me Podcast

\-Limit blue light

\-Limit alcohol/caffeine

\-Work out in the evening

\-read a paper book by dim light

\-journaling

\-calming music

\-warm shower

\-herbal tea

\-Melatonin

\-Over-the-counter sleeping pills that are basically Benadryl

\-sex

\-weed (I live in a rec state)

\-comforting space

\-fan

\-humidifier

\-comfortable blankets

15,"It's been a year since I attempted suicide, and I was really loving my new job since then. I still love it. That's why it's really frustrating that I feel my depression and anxiety creeping back. I changed my circumstances. It's been a full year. I want to be back to normal.

I had consistent days where I just cried from work-related stress. I wanted to do better. Colleagues told me I was doing a great job. My students (I teach) are wonderful, but when they do misbehave, I realized it triggers bad memories from my previous school. I know what I need to do, but my confidence is withering away, and I can't bring myself to have positive thoughts. I love what I do and I love this school, but my depression is killing my motivation to go tomorrow.

My boyfriend freaked out when I texted about feeling *really* suicidal today. He was going to drive all the way to my place (we don't live close) if I didn't tell my mom right away. I'm still waiting on my new insurance to get approved, but my mom wanted to make sure I get back to therapy. I was told I was being way too hard on myself and overworking again when I explained why I was feeling down. My mom apologized for not noticing and questioning my dropped mood. There was no need to.

I am home with my mom. I am exhausted. I still feel like crying. I don't know how I'll be tomorrow. I don't want to go back to being unmotivated and dead inside.

Right now, I don't feel like doing anything. I'm disappointed in myself. I hate feeling like this. Where did my confidence go? Where did my motivation go? I wanted to prove myself I could do this.

And with all this Coronavirus crap that's going on, I don't want to admit myself to a hospital. It's like the worst timing.

I've only been dating this guy for 6 months, but he has brought so much joy and positivity in my life. I told him not to come over (he has a busy work schedule too), but I feel like I'm going to lose my mind. This isn't what he signed up for. I don't want to struggle with depression all over again. I don't want him to blame himself if I go through with suicide. He's been such a blessing for me. This is just too much for me to handle.

I never verbalized that I love him, but I do. So if I'm not here anymore, I'll leave this message up on my laptop. Love you handsome. Thank you for everything you do. I genuinely enjoy spending time together. I know you said it's OK to take a day off and recharge, but I think I'm far too gone. I'm a bit tired of dealing with my mental health all over again. I've done the whole therapy and meds things before. If I can't handle teaching at a wonderful school, I don't see what the point is anymore.

The past year has been nothing but hell on earth for my mental health. I’m not sure what the catalyst was but I cannot remember the last time I felt like a normal human being and it’s just been getting worse. I cannot live the rest of my life like this and I know that eventually I’ll be better (I hope) but right now everything sucks. 

95% of the time I feel so hopeless, lethargic, and depressed that I can’t take care of myself or get out of bed. I feel so pathetic and useless. 
The other 5% of the time, I’m so up in the clouds that I can’t connect to what’s around me or ground myself. I’m constantly constructing new grand ideas and going on shopping sprees. Once I buy things or have ideas all figured out, I either get bored with them or get so depressed I can’t do anything with them. I’m ~$100k in debt at age 24 and I live with my parents. My mom has to give me money for things I need. I just feel like a piece of useless trash like I’m maturing backwards and I’m 16 again. 

I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety, adhd, and depression. I’ve been tossed back and forth between being dx as bipolar and not. I suspect I also have BPD but that’s never been brought up. I’m just not sure what’s wrong with me at this point and I just want a definitive diagnosis. I take 6 different meds and I still feel awful. I start therapy this week which I’m excited for bc I definitely need it, but I’m scared my feelings will be invalidated or it won’t work or they’ll decide they need to throw me into a mental hospital. 

With the help of my best friends at work, I’m slowly learning that the way I was treated as a kid was not normal. People don’t realize how hard it hits when you suddenly figure out as an adult that your mom isn’t supposed to yell at you for touching her or pull your hair and slap you in the face when she’s mad; that’s a whole different story. 

I just want to be able to clean my fucking room. But here I am, surrounded by piles and piles of clothes and shit I bought that I don’t need, empty cups and bottles, and evidence of nighttime binge eating. I just want to be a functioning adult and I’m scared it’ll never happen. I wanna be happy with a husband and kids and a house and a good life. I wanna be financially stable.

It takes too much out of me to keep a conversation with someone, and if I do, I generally don't give a shit about what we're talking about, I just mindlessly mumble back responses. My dad left 5 years ago, my mom died a couple months ago, though I havn't really felt anything bad about it, just empty. Been in poverty my whole life, getting stuck in the system. Mother was poor her whole life, and her mother too. Guess it's our curse. I live with my grandmother, but I guess I'm just waiting for her to die. It keeps me up at night. Medicare was cut off for her and she was denied disability 3 times. We have no income, she isn't physically fit to work, I don't have a vehicle to reliably work full time, I live in the middle of nowhere. We don't have our own rooms, we're bumming off of my now diseased mother's friends. It reminds me of how bitter this world is, and how bitter I have to be to survive. Death surrounds me, but it doesn't effect me anymore. Just another lost soul, right? Shit. I can't care about the six dead kittens that I had to bury because no one else would, neglected to hell. I can't care because if I did, I wouldn't be alive anymore. That goes for the other 20 dead animals littered around the yard, people can't take care of shit? Oh, there's a dead goat too, fucking ridiculous. No one knows what to do about it. Every morning I wake up and realize that hundreds of thousands of people die every day, and that those born will suffer the same fate. It used to kill me, but the pain is my default mood now. I actively piss people off around me, in hopes that they'll hurt me, so I can match my internal pain with an external. It never works. I hate it. When those around my manage to keep a smile on their face, it pisses me off. It's unfair. I feel like I'm being mocked. I don't vent to them. I feel like a burden, why would I ruin their good mood? I just sit and think about them dying so I don't have to realize what I can't obtain, so I don't have to see their stupid fucking grins. My life is a tragedy. I can't run from myself, but suicide is over the top. Maybe I'll just sit down and never get up, unrealistic right? I can't make any meaningful connections with others. I don't talk to them, talking doesn't get rid of the pain. No one understands the pain, no one can help it. I don't smoke anymore, it's hard not to. Sorry for rambling.",09Mar2020,1
21," I hope you are well today. I write for two purposes: to get some things off my chest and to ask for advice. I have been dating my girlfriend for a bit less than a year and we have been living together for several months now in her home country. I work abroad and met her while working in her home country.  She is my first serious partner and I love her dearly. However, my girlfriend has been struggling with major depression (diagnosed) throughout this time period. She occasionally self-harms and expresses suicidal sentiments (which she has once acted on). She takes medications daily and talks with her therapist, maybe once every three weeks. 

Because of the circumstances, I am the breadwinner and able to stretch to provide financial support for both of us together. I’ve encouraged her to apply to find her passions and dreams. However even though she tried hard, she couldn’t hold a formal job or classes (post-college graduation) for more than a month and a half (she resigned all three cases). She would often take sick leave due to her mental illness and said she did not want to be a burden to her employer. Even though, for two of these, they were her professed passion and dream. I think what also strikes me is that she has a tendency to run away from problems. When she quit her classes and her job, she made up her mind, told her teacher/employer, and never came back. This is in an industry that, while is not small, is somewhat niche. While I have no psychological expertise, I believe that her coping mechanism to run away from her problems contributes to her feelings of uselessness.  It hurts me so much. I want to see her succeed and accomplish her dreams. I feel torn, reminding myself that she needs support and love, not someone to be her career counsellor. 

When I bring up job-related topics, it mostly ends in a disagreement. I feel like sometimes are differences are exacerbated by culture (both Asian but different types), but mostly by socioeconomic expectations and family background. I was fortunate to come from a caring and relatively affluent family, but with that was the expectation that I should have professional and formal employment and associate with those who do. Meanwhile she comes from a less fortunate background and a mostly toxic family (with history of abuse, sexual, physical, and verbal).

Sometimes I feel so helpless. I know its not my job to ""fix"" her depression, but I want to aid her in her pathway to recovery. 

For those who have been in this situation, what would your advice be for me? What advice can I give to my girlfriend? For those who have/had depression, what job/type of job or activity has been effective in fitting with your depression?

23,"Anyone else feel more intense emotions during dreams?

I’ve had depression/anxiety for about five years (I’m 26). I’ve more or less learned to live with it and am somewhat functional but my emotional responses are still pretty fried. Most days I just feel numb and go through the motions. On bad days I just feel anxiety, despair and pain. 

Then there are nights where I have vivid, memorable dreams and it “feels” like my emotions are quite normal and strong. I’ve had dreams where I’ve felt anticipation, excitement, happiness and desire. Then as I wake up completely and it’s back to feeling numb and the emotion is gone with the dream. 

Is my brain mimicking these feelings while I’m asleep? Or is it some nostalgic illusion I’m making up as I wake up? I haven’t felt strong emotions (besides anxiety) in years, especially positive emotions, so it kind of takes me by surprise.

I don’t have a therapist anymore otherwise I’d ask a professional but still would like to know if anyone else has felt this too!",09Mar2020,1
24,"My life has been going downhill steadily and i dont know what to do anymore. I have been in therapy for several years now, for health anxiety and social phobia. They locked me up once too. I have no job, no girlfriend, no ambitions, no future. I apply for about 3-5 jobs per week and i dont even get an interview. Constant nightmares. I have barely gone outside now for 2 weeks, in part because of the corona virus, but also because i want to distance myself from my friends because i drink too much with them and they started doing hard drugs which i dont want to get dragged into. Thoughts of ending it are present nearly every day, and i am so tired of trying. Half the nights i wish i dont wake up in the morning. Paranoid of shadows at night. The mental health system here is shit, and all they want to do is either dope me up and hope i dont come back, or punish me.

It feels like i am not connected with society at all and i have constant guilt about stuff i have done and things i have failed at. What should i do?",09Mar2020,1
25,"I'm not sure if this would be called a ""nationality crisis"" but anyway. I'm American as I assume a good portion of people on here are even if you're not. Hi :). I know it sounds silly to have such a thing such as nationality effect my mental health but it does for me.

I see so many people talk bad about people from the US or the US as a country as a whole (obviously some deserved criticism) but some people take it as everyone in the US is so impoverished, fat, that despite how much we talk about our freedoms we have not a lot.

That the US is only a popular place to live because of our blind patriotism to see what's wrong with our country (There are some examples of that trust me). Sometimes people fail to separate our government's agendas and beliefs with the people.

I do agree that the people of the US and especially our government deserve our fair share of criticism. But sometimes it all gets to me and sometimes makes me feel ashamed to be American to be associated with America, and it feels like metioning your American discredits you as someone who's not allowed to have a say or complain that our current struggles is karma for our past as a country as if the common citizen controls our past or even back then controlled it.

I know everyone's experience with the US is unique, my personal experience has been pretty positive, there are many things about the US I would never want to give up like....

The sense of unity as a country that despite our political divisions we are the American people, The variety of good home and foreign food, the diversity of people, that nature, the entertainment, and (depending where you live) where I live the housing for a good house for a family is not bankruptcy high but slightly above my tastes but not to bad overall. I understand the US is not perfect the government or the people but foreigners or the media portrays us as mind controlled citizens blood bound to our political parties uneducated fuck ups when most people I've met hate both parties  and just want to live life, that we are all on the verge of full blown bankruptcy when the worst I've seen is homeless in the cities and scraping by but those occasions are not very common from my own personal experience and every country has a bit of (though higher in the US), that we all carry guns and our police are murder or power hungry ready to shoot anyone who isn't white and looks remotely suspicious and when I have encountered police officers from the cities and small towns who are just average Joe's (secret pun).

26,"Over the past few months I've been constantly being plagued with the idea/desire to physically injure or beat up people.

It's not that I wanna beat *everyone*, but specifically, I  wanna beat up the many wanna-be gangsters and little shits and violent crackheads that have been ruining my neightboorhood as of late.

I'm a self-admitedly huge man. 6'4 and 300 pounds.

I have over 20 years of training in Judo, Wrestling and Boxing, so I don't really fear for my physical safety and am *sure* I can put people down.

I have this recurring fantasy of getting a mask, going out at night and going full batman on any of these kinds of jackass I come across.


The desire has been building so much and I have  actually bought the mask.

I've never been a violent person and I realize this is not normal.

Is this sudden desire to inflict physical violence on others and underlying sympton of a mental illness?

How can I curb this urge?",09Mar2020,1
27,"I’m a third year medical student. I was admitted to a psych facility after my second year before my first board exams (probably the peak of stress in med school). I had a huge breakdown and wanted to kill myself because I thought I was about to get expelled. I wasn’t, I was freaking out about nothing. I had been getting pretty delusional and my perception of things clearly was getting off. I knew I needed help...but I also believed some really crazy stuff there for awhile.

I started hearing voices while I was in the facility and man I was on a really messed up ride when I was in there. I thought they were torturing the patients at nights with saws and drills and stuff. I could hear the saws and the screams at night...it scared the living hell out of me. Those nights were probably the most terrified I’ve ever been in my life.

When I was first admitted I was certain that the place was run by a criminal organization that I delusionally had started believing was real before I was admitted. A few days in I thought we all had implants that had been put in our heads with some criminal technology that no one knew existed and we were communicating via our thoughts (hence the voices). I thought that another med student’s father (the med student was a girl I had a crush on actually) ran this criminal organization and controlled all these people that had implants placed in their heads almost like bees in a beehive. And everything these people said had two meanings. There was the surface level everyday meaning that was intended to blend in to the everyday conversation you were having. Just small talk stuff. Then there was the hidden deeper meaning that was more symbolically derived from the words used. So I thought everything everyone said to me in this place had a second deeper meaning on top of the normal conversation we were having. And that deeper meaning tended to have a lot to do with how much trouble I was in with this organization.

Since I was interested in his daughter, which he knew since they could read every thought I had, even though I was in trouble there was the possibility of me getting initiated into the organization as a ‘chieftain.’ But this guy was getting really pissed at me because of some of my thoughts that he heard which I couldn’t control. In particular he really didn’t like that I was bi. As for that I had decided to come out during med school of all times. It added some significant stress.

Before I got out I thought I was about to get tortured any day because I was pissing him off. Her father was the predominant voice I would hear during this time at nights. I would also communicate with her and some of the other med students via the other psych patients as proxies (I thought elite members of this organization could take over the mind of anyone with implants when they desired) speaking using that coded way of speaking in symbols.

Each day was so elaborate, it’s pretty wild that my mind came up with all of this. Sometimes I was scared to death, most of the time I was uneasy, but sometimes what I was perceiving was so elaborate it was aesthetically pleasing to me. There was one moment when I thought the girl was setting up a scene using all the people with implants to show me what she could do that was truly beautiful.

I ended up becoming friends with this girl when I got out. She’s one of the nicest people I know.

Anyway when I got out they turned me over to my parents. I didn’t think my parents were really my parents. I thought it was like invasion of the bodysnatchers or something. They were other people pretending to be my parents. I thought this organization put implants in all my family members to control me.

Eventually I came back to reality. This only happened by letting go of all those thoughts. I didn’t just randomly start believing these things. They seemed crazy to me but I felt like I had to admit that they were the only ideas that really explained what I was experiencing. I had to just let it go. It didn’t matter if it was real or made sense or not, I chose to let it go. Pretty damn scary tbh. Being around family helped a lot too I think.

Anyway after I got out and pulled myself back together I started studying like crazy for my boards and passed them. Didn’t do as well as I wanted (I had been in the top 10-20% of my class) but did pretty close to average.

Now I’ve about made it through another year of medical school and am still doing well (one more year left). I’ve put most of all of this behind me but I am really unsettled that it happened to me. I didn’t use any drugs or anything. The really wild stuff lasted about 2 weeks but I thought people were speaking in that coded way for months. Right now the docs I’ve seen are calling it an extended psychotic episode fueled by sleep deprivation (I’d gone several days without sleep) and stress but all that needs to happen for it to turn into schizophrenia or something similar is for this to happen again at some point now.

Still doing good right now though as far as I know. Not hearing voices anymore. No delusions that I know. Not living in a bizarre state of affairs. I’ve just been on sertraline and low dose aripiprazole since, not a huge deal there yet. Just need to make it another year!",09Mar2020,1
28,"I'm a 23 year old woman, though I honestly feel like I'm stuck in the mindset of a child entering adolescence. I'm not sure if it's due to childhood trauma, being developmentally delayed or potentially on the autism spectrum, or a combination of things. Either way, I find myself feeling significantly far behind compared to my peers.

People talk to me like I'm a small child, and it hurts to know that their demeanor changes significantly when talking to someone else. It's embarrassing and painful for me to here the condescending tone in their voices, to be treated like I'm incompetent. I've been told that my voice sounds really odd, so maybe that's a contributing factor to my treatment from others.

It also doesn't help that I've been taken advantage of by others in the past, and I probably would be considered a vulnerable adult to others. I hate realizing after the fact that maybe I shouldn't have done something, or that I was being lied to. I wish I had the ability to use critical thinking skills in the moment as opposed to just acting impulsively without a second thought.

I know people tell me that I'm intelligent, and I guess I did do well academically in school. However, what good does that do me if I don't have wisdom and use actual logic and reasoning? How come I couldn't make it past a semester in college without going to a psych ward from being overwhelmed? Why am I struggling to find a job or nail an interview?

I'm just stupid, vulnerable, and unable to properly function in society. People don't want a moron in their presence, and I can't blame someone for wanting a competent person among them. I want to be normal: I want to not be seen as an idiot or incapable of functioning in society. Unfortunately, it seems as though I stick out like a sore thumb.",09Mar2020,1
29,"context: ive been 18 only a few months and my family's insurance sucks, but based on the bits and pieces ive told my mom, shes trying to find a way to get me to see a professional. 

i cant figure out any idea of what could be wrong with me. on a good day/week, this feeling only happens about 5%-10% of the time. it feels like all the my experiences are buffering and im experiencing everything late. i vaguely understand that things happen, but it can be hours or days before i am able to process these memories enough to access them fully or think about them. on a bad week its somewhere between 50%-80% of the time that i feel like im 'lagging'. this week was both incredible and terrible, in that i was extremely mentally compromised by paranoia, but objectively good things kept happening. i didnt fully know anything that happened monday until almost thursday, and thursday and friday didnt 'load' until about an hour ago. it just feels like im watching through a blurry security camera. i have no clue whats wrong with me. 

paranoia is telling me that ive got something like did or osdd, but the rational part of me knows i dont have the trauma to cause that. i didnt dissociate as a kid. i didnt actively start repressing bad feelings or pretending i was fine when i wasnt until my mid teens. i need to put a name to these issues so i can stop obsessively telling myself i have something i dont have.",09Mar2020,1
30,"Not sure why but for the last week I've been feeling distanced from reality like i'm experiencing symptoms of derealisation.Even when I forget that I have feelings of derealisation it just I think about it later and in memories I feel like everything I do is a dream.  
Whenever I tell my mum that this is happening to me she just says its normal for someone like me with anxiety and for the first few days it was fine but now it keeps going on and isn't stopping.  


Is it normal to have a derealisation episode for a week or more? It's really messing with my life at this point because I can't differentiate reality from a dream and I can't enjoy things constantly feeling like things i'm doing aren't actually happening such as writing this post.",09Mar2020,1
31,"For years I’ve struggled with Depersonalization/Derealization disorder. Up until last year I had no clue I was dealing with it, I just thought not recognizing myself in the mirror must be normal. That was until I had scared myself one day and looked up what I was feeling and found DPDR. But from what I remember I’ve always had the symptoms my entire life. I don’t remember a day I didn’t feel the way I do rn.

The next time I went to a doctor I talked to them about how I felt. And they said they have heard of it but wasn’t sure how to help so they sent me to a therapist. A few weeks down the line I start talking to a therapist, I describe to him what I’m dealing with and he says “well, I’ve heard of it but I’m sorry I can’t help you with that in particular. Is there something else?” 

At that point I was devastated. I eventually got a psychiatrist who ended up saying nearly the exact same thing but ended up switching my meds to adderall (I’ve got ADHD too) and that helped marginally. He ended up sending me to a neurologist who said the same thing as he did and refused to do the tests my psychiatrist ordered.

A few months after seeing the first therapist I switched to a new one who is muchhhh better but she still has no clue how to help. 

So after months and months of trying to get help with my DPDR I’ve been left with the same answer from therapists to neurologists to physicians to psychiatrists. They’ve all given me the same exact answer. 

I can’t find anyone to help me with it...no one knows about it and all the specialists are at the least 6 hours away. It’s ripping me apart that I can’t even get the symptoms to go away for a minute.",09Mar2020,1

She's also apparently made a number of remarks talking about being suicidal. I struggled with both depression and self-harm at her age as well, so I can understand how she's feeling, but I still don't know what to do. My parents... don't understand mental illness very well and they were not understanding in the slightest when I struggled. I don't want to put her through that as it would likely only make her feel worse. The biggest issue here is that she absolutely refuses to talk about anything that's wrong.

35,"Last year ended up incredibly traumatic for me. I was sexually assaulted which caused me to lose my job and one of my best friends. The stress was so bad that my stomach constantly felt like I was on a rollercoaster, and this uneasy feeling lasted for weeks. A few months later I had a horrible (but consensual) sexual experience with someone and I regret it so much, I made myself forget it happened, and during the experience I just disassociated in order to endure it.

Fast forward another 5 months and my ability to concentrate is at a minimum (it was bad before but it's getting worse) and I keep getting flashbacks. I can't stop myself from thinking about the people responsible for the intense stress I felt. I see posts online about women and assault experiences and I get angry and upset, I deleted Facebook and instagram because I couldn't deal with it. I feel dirty a lot, and my general anxiety has just been on a huge increase since Christmas.

36,"It's been such a fucking journey. Holy.

Just want to start off by saying that it's been a mental rollercoaster and it's defining me as a person. 

So many people think alcohol is no big deal. Many people think it's safe in moderation but it's one of the worst drugs out there. I drank heavily for years just to numb myself from feeling guilt for my life choices and past trauma. I really want to advocate for better care and awareness for substance abusers and mental health. I thought I was fine I'd drink every night to quell my sorrow and in turn I would wake up the next day feeling awful and lethargic. 

Since quitting alcohol I've been painting. I've been using it as an outlet for my pain and growth. I've been singing in the shower for the first time in years. I'm working on a children's book and I've been working as a freelancer. If you need to know theres a way out I want you to know there is. 

I certainly didn't think I'd be writing this post today but here I am. I feel strength fueling my body daily. I feel nourished by the food I eat, rested with sleep and hydrated with the water I drink.

Might be worth noting that I (25f) am high functioning aspergers with pretty bad anxiety. I live in the middle of nowhere and our only shop closes 9pm or 10pm. The past year I’ve come to realise that I am probably an alcoholic, but my alcoholism doesn’t seem to exist when I’m in a city and that is why I’m writing this post.

In my village our shop closes early so I have nowhere else to shop at night. I drink a lot, 70cl of spirit upto 3 times a week. However, I visit cities often (I spend a month or 2 in Seoul every year) and I don’t drink much at all there even though I go to meet friends.

I have noticed that any time I live in an area where shops aren’t 24hr I get antsy and I HAVE to go to the shop before it closes. I tried not drinking tonight but when it got to 10mins before the shop closed I gave up and ran to the shop to get wine. I don’t do this when I have a 24hr shop nearby, in fact I dont even drink half as much and tend to only drink in social settings in those scenarios. So my current situation means I always go to the shop and get drinks and then get far too drunk and hate myself which I really want to stop doing. But like I said, when I live in 24hr places that isn’t a problem, I’m very sensible and have no anxieties about it, go to bed at a normal time, wake up at a normal time, drink normal amounts. It’s like I HAVE to drink when shops aren’t 24hr?

51,"I'm half venting and half asking for advice.

My depression started more than a few years ago, I can't place a date on it exactly. Not gonna really go into it too much, but I never really felt I had a reason to be depressed - I just was. It got better last May. So much better. I was happy. I got my shit together, I started being hygienic again, and Iost 50 pounds. I was making improvements into my life.

But these past few months have been tough. Again, for no reason. And it comes and goes but holy shit the plows are the worst I've ever had. It sometimes just lasts a few hours sometimes a few days. Recently I've been wishing that I'd just die suddenly. Now, I'm not going to commit suicide, I've got too much to live for, but I'm not gonna lie that I've really thought it would be convenient. I've been entertaining it while I'm not in the ""lows"". Like, what if that big truck swerved and hit me head on? Imagine not having to deal with anything anymore. Just released from everything, from stress, responsibility, and the inevitable lows to come.

I don't see an underlying problem. A lot of people would kill to be where I'm standing. Still, knowing this, I am depressed. I'm starting to think there's a chemical imbalance or something.

But I can't exactly seek help. Well, I'm not sure. I'd like to see a therapist but my schedule is the worst. I could move things around to make time for it. The main thing I'm worried about is that I'm in the process of obtaining a security clearance. I'm not sure if they can see that, but I think they would if I were diagnosed with a mental illness. If that happens, I'd lose my job and I wouldn't be able to support my current lifestyle at other jobs that o would qualify for. Does anyone know if they can see this?

Also, any tips to avoid the lows would be appreciated.",09Mar2020,1

55,"So, I happen to be a very touchy-feely kinda person. One of my favorite things to do is to just cuddle and watch something funny with a friend or play video games with them or something. Unfortunately, past a certain age, it seems to be extremely difficult to get this outside of romantic relationships. 

Romantic relationships are fine and all, except I don't have any desire for a sexual relationship. Like, at all. I've been exposed to so much locker room talk that I am fairly certain that anybody that's with me is settling and it seems to be a fairly common thing to fantasize about other people while having sex with your partner. For me, sexual activity is almost entirely about bonding with the other person. As a purely physical act, I can happily live without it. I find the idea of using or being used like that pretty repulsive and that's not going to change.

So, clearly, since I lack the desire for a sexual relationship, a romantic relationship is likely out of the question. The question is, what is the best way to prevent touch starvation in this situation. I don't have a lot of money, so hiring a professional cuddler or getting massages isn't an option. Many of my close friends don't live in the area, anymore, either.",09Mar2020,1
56,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for a while now.. Just constant fear of messing up, always being looked at and judged, and always feeling like I’m never going to get anything right. It can hinder my day to day activities, and sometimes ruin plans, days, or special occasions. I’m very stressed, not knowing whether or not where i’m at in life is good because i’m still here, or bad that i’m not farther ahead yet. I’m worrying too much about what people think and what work thinks of me, or what I will make of my career. But there’s this feeling that i’ve had for a very long time. This feeling I feel everyday, it’s hard to explain. It’s this feeling of knowing that I’m trapped and making decisions that I cannot change. Almost like i’m on autopilot. Where its like i’m just watching from the outside looking in. I feel like I’m a burden to everyone and that everyone is there for me out of pity. I feel like no matter how hard I try to make everyone happy, I fail and wind up disappointing myself and everyone else. This feeling that I’m always living the worst case scenario. Where I always expect the worst and no matter how hard I try to avoid that, I always can see it coming. I don’t really have optimism for anything anymore. Any obstacle i’m faced with now I tend to immediately think that I can’t get over it. I know I can, but I can’t. I feel like my life is a game of tug of war, and it’s just me vs me. I know this sounds dumb and I hate explaining this because only I know what i’m feeling exactly, but i can never really put it into words. Some days are worse than others, some days it’s non existent. Some days, it consumes me and never lets go. I can never understand it, so  I guess I just live with it.",09Mar2020,1

58,"Today was my birthday. My dad decided today was the perfect day to yell at me &amp; my husband (we are in our 20’s &amp; we’ve been staying with my dad while trying to buy our first home) bc the hall bathroom toilet overflowed. It was no ones fault. Anyone who has ever lived anywhere with a toilet knows that these things happen sometimes. He was screaming at us, saying it was our fault &amp; we needed to fix it. 

I hit my breaking point.

I finally stood up for myself. My husband wanted to intervene on my behalf &amp; I told him no. That this was between me &amp; my father. I needed to stand up to him for once. There was so much adrenaline pumping bc of how angry I was I started hitting the kitchen counter. When I was done my husband &amp; I left for the rest of the day. But we currently still live in his house. So we waited to go back until we knew he was asleep. We’re going to start looking for a new place to live tomorrow. Buying a house will just have to wait.

But now I don’t want to, &amp; just can’t, face my dad after that. I’m laying in bed awake at 1am, breaking out in hives &amp; feeling like my heart is going to break out of my chest bc I’m thinking about how I’m going to handle seeing him tomorrow &amp; how I’m going to handle the next couple weeks until we find a new place to live.

59,"I apologize for the length, I just have to get all this out. 2020 has been rough already.

I have pretty severe depression and anxiety but no SI for the most part. Ive smoked weed daily for the better part of 2 years, this is relevant later. Over the past 5-6 years I’ve made so much progress in bettering myself, becoming healthier, replacing toxic coping mechanisms with healthy ones, learning financial stability and all in all learning to be happy. In January I was at a high in my life. Probably never felt better. It was the culmination of one of my biggest pushes to break my depression fog and start working out frequently. 

By the time February came around I was riding my bike 8 miles every 3 days or so and going to the gym to run for 20 minutes straight at least 1 day a week. I felt amazing. I was kicking energy drinks and coffee for tea and didn’t feel I needed more energy than that. I had also kicked my 7 year long habit of nicotine. I was on the path to a long and healthy life and ready to say goodbye to depression for the foreseeable. Even my anxiety was a breeze to handle. 

Then my best friend was killed in a hit and run incident.

I was sitting at home on a Sunday night, winding down before bed because I had work the next day. My best friends girlfriend texts me and asks if my girlfriend and I are free at the moment. I say yes. I’m confused, why would she be texting me? We’re on good terms but not like this. She shows up and her lip is busted open and she’s pretty messed up. First thought that ran through my mind was, my friend beat her or something. He’s not like that in the slightest but...I don’t know what else this could be. She says “J and I were driving home from the store last night when someone attacked us and...J didn’t make it.” 

It didn’t register with me at all. “What do you mean J didn’t make it? Where is he?” They both just stare at me. Then it hits me all at once, and I’ve never felt a feeling quite like that. The crying was a little delayed but boy did I cry. I cried for 3 weeks, almost daily. I cried at home, I cried with my girlfriend, I cried alone, I cried at work. I cried when I didn’t want to cry anymore. Crying wasn’t the worst of it though.

My depression hit me a few days later with a vengeance. My panic disorder was back. Panic attacks nightly. Pretty much every time I smoked weed, but I couldn’t stop. I smoked multiple times a day to be numb, where before I only smoked at night a few hours before bed. My mental health was tanking. The funeral came and went and I started to recover a bit. More than a bit maybe. I was having happy days here and there. Things were going to be okay. 

J’s girlfriend ended up staying with us for about 3 weeks because the killer is yet to be caught and she’s scared. She brings her Dog as well. A few days later, I get ringworm. At first it was only one spot but after a week, it’s in 5 spots in various places around my body. This is bad, the dog gave me ring worm and the over the counter cream isn’t doing jack shit. I go to a minute clinic and they give me a stronger prescription cream. It keeps the ringworm from getting worse but that’s about it. I go back and she prescribes me an oral medication. Apparently it’s hard on the liver but if I have no liver problems I’m good. Cool.

Meds are working good and ringworm is going away fast but I’m experiencing a lot of very small side effects. I can stick it out, I think. It’s only a 14 day supply. Boy was I wrong. Side effects start to kick up abruptly. I’m having trouble sleeping. My stomach is always fucked up. My bones and joints are aching. I’m irritable. I just feel sick in general. Everything Is just minor enough where I don’t think it’s bad enough to stop the meds. In hindsight should’ve stopped.

 I start to think it’s also having a negative interaction with weed. Being high feels slightly different than it used to in a noticeably bad way. Panic attacks are more abundant, and I feel depressed while high, whereas before it was what I used to stabilize my mood. I ignore it because whatever I’m used to fucked up shit I guess and I’m pretty much addicted to being numb. 

8 days go by of this worsening slightly every day. A few days ago my sister invites me to come smoke at her new apartment because she made a gravity bong. Cool, I say, let’s get baked I haven’t seen her since the funeral. I go over and she gives me the first hit. A whole bowl in one gravity bong rip. It hits me as expected. I’m coughing a ton. I sit down and I remember saying “Woah I haven’t been high like this in awhile.” I keep coughing for like 10 minutes and the high is good but it’s slowly turning dark. I feel intensely sad and extremely anxious all of a sudden. On top of that I’m pretty sure I have to throw up. I calmly get up and pretend I just gotta go to the bathroom normally. I go in there, immediately lay on the ground and start crying. I cry silently and ask myself why I keep doing this. Why do I keep smoking when it’s clearly having adverse effects? As I’m laying there I sit up to throw up and I realize I’m still getting higher and I’m getting dizzy. Then I start to feel like I can’t breathe. I throw up and I’m panicking but trying to keep quiet so I don’t cause a scene. Then I start to experience loss of reality and I’m remaining conscious but i can’t keep my eyes open or focus on anything. Nothing is making sense. My brain feels...swollen? It’s hard to remember what I was feeling but things were going south.

I decide it’s time to ask my girlfriend to come get me. I text her and she comes with water. I’m too fucked up to leave. All in all I stay in that bathroom unable to move for about 5 hours with my girlfriend chilling next to me. She’s a fucking saint. I was able to get up and go home after the high wore off a little but i was still beside myself the rest of the night.

I woke up the next day and I didn’t feel like myself. That intense sadness was still there and I was very disoriented and empty. Sucks but whatever, I felt like I bruised my brain being an idiot and “I’ll be fine tomorrow.” Guess what? Tomorrow wasn’t fine, the next day wasn’t fine, and neither was the next day. I’ve literally been an empty shell of myself faking almost every word I say to seem fine for the past 4 days. I think I fucked myself up real bad and I don’t know what to do. I’m so numb and I feel so...wrong. I can’t explain it. I’ve had some dark thoughts and I’ve never wanted to die this much before. 

What the fuck is wrong with me? Why did I let myself spiral this far? I don’t want to kill myself but I want to be dead. I feel confused about everything all the time. I’m barely able to hold conversations. I can’t focus on anything. I’m so disappointed in myself...I ruined all that progress and I know it’s going to take a long time to get back. I don’t even know if it’s worth it to try. What if this shit I’m feeling now doesn’t go away? What if I’m permanently changed?

TLDR: My mental health tanked after being at a life long high of happiness and stability due to my best friend being killed. I abused marijuana to feel better. Started taking a medication that’s been fucking me up and may have a bad interaction with marijuana. I’m addicted so don’t care and fry myself into a vegetable after a gravity bong hit.",09Mar2020,1
61,"We are aware of the fact that getting a difficult child to attend [child therapy in Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/child-therapy/) can be a herculean task due to their tantrums and lack of cooperation. Children who act out or behave difficult can be extremely overwhelming for everyone around them, especially their family, friends and teachers. Even if you can’t get your child to go to child therapy, you can bring group therapy activities to them! We would ultimately still recommend trying to get them to get within a group since that helps them socialize with peers. 

It’s important to understand that group therapy activities like these intend to keep your child busy and engaged while also using their cognitive abilities and paying attention. It may not seem directly beneficial but are indirectly using their mind in more ways than meet the eye. Here are some group therapy activities that can be practices even outside of a formal group:

**Team Obstacle Course -** Gather up a few children or teenagers who you know will not work in harmony unless made to do so. How to make them realize the importance of a team? Divide them into two teams and build an obstacle course. The team must complete the course while holding hands! If the hand chain breaks, the game starts over. This builds a sense of encouragement and urge to win within children and also teaches them the importance of working as a team.

**Mirroring  -** This is a technique that is often used by a [therapist for teens](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/teen-therapy/) for teenagers who find it difficult to cooperate with each other or cannot see the fault in their actions. Two children/teens are made to face each other and one of them begins by initiating random movements, the other is supposed to copy them. Roles are then exchanged. This helps teenagers work in coordination and can also help a therapist for teens to recognize any maladaptive behaviors. 

**Expressing with Puppets -** Children often find it difficult to express what they’re thinking or feeling owing to the fear of being afraid of being judged. Playing with puppets, stuffed toys or action figures gives children a safe outlet to communicate their thoughts. This is one of the most common [group therapy activities](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/) for child therapy. 

**Story Telling -** Most children want to be heard, crave attention and want to take charge. The simplest way to do this while also stimulating their mind is to allow them to be storytellers. Pick a story that easily grasps the attention of children and pick a child to start reading this story. To ensure each child is also listening and paying attention, randomly pick another child and ask them to start reading from where the previous child left off. This also builds confidence within the child and helps them work on their public speaking skills. 

**Relay Races -** The combination of a competition and teamwork is undeniably the most effective one. A child will learn the true value of team work only when their own personal win is at stake and solely depends on how well he and his teammates perform. Neither can he win alone, neither can anybody else within the team. The easiest way to achieve this is through a relay race for not only does it require teamwork but also individual effort within the team that accounts for teamwork.",09Mar2020,1
62,"I had a good dream last night. I almost never have good dreams.

In this dream, I was in what I think was the dance studio in the arts building at my college. Either that, or it was some combination of that and the ensemble dressing room at our college’s main theatre (which I’ve also dreamed about before). 

In the dream, one of my good friends was talking to me about how she had wanted to be a computer science major, too. I was surprised by this, considering I knew her to be a theatre major, but pleasantly so. I asked more about it, and she said that yeah—she was going to move back to the Bay Area (I misremembered where in California she was from in this dream, but that’s not important) after college, or back to California anyway, to try and work in the theatre/movies/TV industry and etc. out there, and she had wanted to have some practical skills that could carry over into Silicon Valley once she got there.

I don’t know why I wanted her to be a computer science major, why my surprise was so pleasant, but I can venture guesses. I was happy to have been doing something myself I thought she would be proud of; it felt really cool that she was interested in, looked up to, or wanted to learn more about something I know a lot about/have experience in/am good at. It was a change in our dynamic: Normally, I’m looking up to her, speaking from a position of little experience. She never makes me feel inadequate—the literal opposite. She’s an incredibly supportive, thoughtful theatre practitioner and friend. But it was a nice surprise to find myself in a situation where this person I admire (and love) so much wanted to learn about what I do. What I know. (I won’t say “what I’m good at,” because I know I work hard at theatre and am good at that, too, but that was implied.) It was like my feelings of incompetency and dis-admiration lifted for a moment, and what a wonderful feeling. And, I think I felt that pleasant surprise, too, because I was very happy just to connect with her (which is another thing I struggle with—feeling I connect with people—social anxiety, GAD, depression, PTSD, related trauma, having lived through a lifetime of ableist treatment, and all that).

In the dream, she and a lot of our other, theatre-involved friends were there. I remember several of my favorite girl theatre friends being there specifically, and then a handful of other folks I’ve worked on shows and become friends with during college were hanging out, too. I remember we were settling down into a circle. The coat racks from the dressing room were there; the mirrors and stations of the dressing room blended with the floor, mirrors, and bars of the dance studio. The girl from the beginning of the dream and I were talking and she got up from her dressing room station—others hanging out, chatting, listening—and the group came into a casual circle for some activity. Then, as we did that and she circled over, I was sitting on the floor at some point (my wheelchair was somewhere around), she sat down behind me on the floor, and I relaxed back into her arms. She wrapped her arms around my waste, under mine. It was totally casual, not unusual at all, the most natural thing. And into it, into that moment of relaxation—that was the most distinct feeling of relaxation I have felt in years of my life.

I don’t have good dreams very often. Most often, I have anxiety dreams—what you might call “little nightmares”—and I have them almost every night. To me, they seem like my mind playing out the little, everyday scenarios I’m almost always anxious about. (I like, on some level, to imagine that, anyway, because as much as I both love and hate my brain, it makes it seem a little better to imagine it’s at least being “productive”.) They could be my neurons misfiring or my brain haunting itself—“spooky action at a distance,” so to speak. It could be all of the above; I’m not sure.

I think it’s really telling, though, that of my recent good dreams, most of them are in the theatre.

I had so many good times in that dressing room with so many good people. In these and many moments, I’m grateful I found them.

And tonight, as I prepare to go to sleep and write this, thinking about the good dream I had last night—I’m thankful. 

😊💛❤️

63,"Hello, all! 

I'm 18F, and have always gotten along better with men in terms of friendships. I've never been the kind to hang around them for the romantic/sexual attention, I just like being friends. 

I believe that this may stem from several factors. The majority of my family is apostolic pentecostal christians, and I was raised in it as well. Pentecostals believe that women should always be modest, aka only wear skirts and dresses, and never cut their hair, along with a plethora of other ""rules"". I am no longer involved in the church and never abided by these rules to begin with. Due to such, women of the church, even family, have thought of me as ""not holy enough"" or ""unpure"" for simply being myself. I attended a conference last summer, and my old pastor's daughters treated me like garbage the entire time. I know not all christians are like that and I mean no disrespect; however, these experiences have kinda made me distance myself from other women. 

I also went through a horrible bullying situation in middle school at the hands of my ex-best friend. She and some other girls tormented me constantly, and I had to leave the school or else I would've taken my own life. I have only made a few friends since, with only two of which (both online) being female. My dad is a workaholic and has been distant for most of my life as well. I don't know if my insecure attachment to him makes me crave the attention and approval of men or what. 

Earlier today, I was playing some games with friends and we came across a girl in one of them. My close friend invited her to our Discord server to chat and play, and I went from happy and cracking jokes to feeling extremely awkward and quiet. She seemed very nice; however, I just can't help but feel out of place around other women. I am in school to become a nurse, a predominantly female occupation, and these feelings worry me. I never want to be rude, but just can't seem to shake off my past experiences to allow other women to be my friends again.

Any advice? Thank you in advance!",09Mar2020,1
64,"i’ve been begging them for so long to take me to a mental health screening. a therapist. something. anything so i could find out what was wrong with me. back in february of last year i had a panic attack that triggered what i believe to be dpdr. there hasn’t been a day since that i haven’t been dissociating or panicking. most days i don’t want to get out of bed. sometimes i’ll get very overstimulated and feel like my clothes are strangling me and my blanket is suffocating me to the point where i have to strip myself and lay in the cold, and just cry. i can’t do certain things because of how scared i am of being sick or getting sick or something being wrong with my body. 
months of begging. and crying. and they won’t. after giving my sister whatever treatment she wanted, taking her to the hospital, giving her ekgs, taking her to a therapist, they won’t do fucking anything for me. nothing.
my mom has taken me to a doctor ONE TIME not related to a check up. and when i asked about anti anxiety meds, my mom made them give me the smallest dose possible. of course, it didn’t work, because i have (assumed, not diagnosed) severe anxiety. since then she’s refused any kind of treatment i’ve asked for. therapist, doctor visits. she says it’s a money issue when our insurance covers a pretty big portion of the bill. i just don’t know what to do. i don’t feel like anyone takes me seriously and no one believes that there’s something wrong with me and that i’m making it up. i’ve cried to my mom, shaking and having a panic attack, and she’ll still tell me the next day i was overreacting and it’s all in my head. i can’t fucking do it anymore.",09Mar2020,1
65,"Long story short, I’ve been clean off opiates for over a month now and the majority of my withdrawal symptoms have subsided. I’m still taking a couple comfort meds for the remaining anxiety and nerve pain, but I’ve noticed depression creeping in over the last week. These last few days have felt like I’ve had all the life sucked out of me, and it hasn’t shown any sign of subsiding.

I’ve been involuntarily hospitalized in the past for a suicide attempt. I have a history of depression and anxiety as a teenager, and I still have the scars all over my arms and legs as a reminder.

At what point is it worth calling my doctor to move my next appointment up sooner? It’s currently a month away. I don’t think I’m at risk of doing anything now, but I’m worried about this progressing into something worse. The recent withdrawal from opiates complicates things as well.",09Mar2020,1
66,"I am an environmental engineer who studies air pollution. I have a friend who is a war correspondent in Syria. He posted before and after satellite images of Syria at night before the war and at the present day to show how many people have left the country and how much of the electricity grid has been disabled. 

He wrote a column a while back about the environmental consequences of the Syrians war.  Given my research focus, I was intrigued. I commented on these satellite photos, in reference to his article, that a silverlining of ISIS has been a reduction in air pollution in Syria.  However, the human cost has been tremendous.  Yet, I remember you also wrote that artillery, bombs, and munitions are causing forest and brush fires, so I may be wrong.

I checked my twitter and had tons of hate messages claiming I was an ecofascist, a war criminal, and I was saying the Syrian Civil War was a good thing. The ring leader was a guy who like me works in sustainability. He paraphrased my comment and claimed that the Syrian War was good because it killed people, and dead people dont create pollution. He then retweeted this and got his followers to dogpile me, telling me to fuck off and saying I am a genocidal maniac.

I apologized. I acknowledged that my comment was callous, and I deleted it. Many of the people who initially went me hate mail apologized to me. My friend, the war correspondent stuck his neck out and told me and his followers that I wasn't a monster. 

However, the initial guy that misquoted me as saying war is good because it kills people and reduces emissions refuses to acknowledge or admit his mistake. I reached out. I apologized. I deleted the comment that triggered him. But he continues bashing me on his twitter. He makes me so mad because he and I work in the same field sustainability. 

As a liberal, I get hate from the alt-right  all the time calling me a reactionary SJW for bringing up climate change or air pollution. They will claim I have misquoted them even when I link to their articles.  Yet, this guy who is attacking me on Twitter, who works in my field and with whom I share political beliefs is fulfilling this SJW STEREOTYPE.

I get so angry when liberals eat their young. I am a died in the wool liberal, but I can understand why someone younger than me who sticks their neck out to ask a question and then gets dogpiled by people calling them a fascist could easily say screw it and become a member of the alt-right.",09Mar2020,1
67,"I'm currently taking 300mg of Venlafaxine, and I'm experiencing vivid nightmares every night for the past year.  In the beginning they changed often, were terrifying, and usually when I woke up I stayed in a panic/depressed state, feeling like I was still in the dream, for about half an hour. 

Now the dreams are different and seem to always take place in the same area, or at least I always end up back at the same area in my dreams. They're less terrifying and more... unsettling? And when I wake up I usually feel either unbelievably tired, depressed, or both. 

I did some reading and discovered that antidepressants (that target serotonin anyway) can cause vivid dreams/nightmares and my doctor NEVER told me about this. Even though I've told him and my psychiatrist that I have nightmares.

It's so bad that most nights I'm afraid to fall asleep, it's dreadful. I don't want to go back to that place. So I'm wondering;

Has anyone else had this experience with antidepressants? Venlafaxine specifically? What did you do about it? How do I cope with the nightmares?

68,"So as recent as last week, I all of a sudden started having vivid thoughts of myself dying. I would see a pair of scissors and a thought would pop up of “what If those were in my neck?” Or I’ll be driving and I’ll think “what if I just drove off the side of the road?”. Then I’ll think of how my parents would react and how my friends would react to my death. The weird part is I don’t want to have these thoughts. I am not depressed. I do not think I am useless or better off dead. I still go out with friends and laugh yet I don’t get the same release I normally do cause these thoughts still linger. I think I may be making it worse by constantly thinking about it. When I’m distracted and not thinking about it, I go “hey I’m not thinking about it anymore” which then I obviously start thinking them again. Sometimes it feels more like An urge rather than a thought like I want to try it but I never do and I keep telling myself I shouldn’t be having these thoughts and it’s actually scaring me that I am. I saw my doctor and she prescribed me citolapram but I haven’t started taking it yet. Is this something that will pass? Has this ever happened to anyone else? Any help is appreciated.",09Mar2020,1
69,"I don't know at all what I am experiencing or if it has a formal name.

I cant remember for how long now, I want to say years but I really don't know. It's always been in the back of my mind but only now can I acknowledge it.

I feel like my life has special value to it, or a certain special purpose. I really can't explain it well enough. Though I often believe, even now that I may very well be in a film. Like my life is a film. Not being filmed during showers etc but more eventful stuff, which there's plenty of indeed.

I just feel like a protagonist, a special someone. I don't know if I need to do anything or if it's just to see how my life will unfold. But I feel somehow there is an almost supernatural interest in my life. I know that sounds stupid but I'm struggling to explain.

I really can't describe it other than special. I regularly view my own kife through this idea I'm in a film. The music I experience, the events of my life and all the emotions included. Funnily enough as I've come to be more aware of this feeling I've lost touch more with my emotions. For someone with both ASD and Bioolar I find this extremely odd as I haven't even taken my medication for about a month through no fault of my own (pharmacy problems).

Although as I watch myself in my head in this movie I imagine myself in, I find myself as the protagonist, even a hero at times. I have wondered over the past few days if my life will be a tragedy or more alike to a happily ever after type film.

I imagine myself as the hero as I have a strong sense of right and wrong, and often throughout my life I have faced challenges that test my morality. I feel the strength I have to own my problems, to take responsibility for my actions and face any proceeding consequences is quite a unique trait amongst the majority of people I've encountered in my own opinion. It might sound stupid but I've also considered if I was sent by god. I'm not entirely religious and I'm not aware of so if that was the case and even then I'm not hard set if that's it. But I feel I've been placed here to test the morality of others, and to do right where they might do wrong as best I can and lead others to righteousness through example.

I can't shake the feeling of being special, and being in a film. I'm quite aware that it's something quite odd but I just can't shake it.

Another thing is I can't help but shake the feeling that I'm sick. I don't know why but I have the strong sense that sometime soon I'm going to die. The doctors have told me I'm fine but again, I feel the touch of death nearby and I am almost at piece with that. I think I'll die happy knowing I did my best to do the right thing, I just hope others can learn from my mistakes as well as I did.",09Mar2020,1

71,"I haven't felt like myself for the past two months and I hate it

Prepare for a long read potentially. I need to get it out somehow I suppose.

But the past two months I have felt like a completely different person. One of my extremely close friends that I game with online made a new friend that he plays with a lot more than me. And he started excluding me from the group and not inviting me. So I would start asking him if I could play, trying to insert myself into the games to have fun. And he said that I was being pushy and taking away game time from his other friends...



That's when I told him that I felt like I was being placed on the backburner and that it made me feel really shitty. Like I wasn't good enough to be included. And he told me I was overreacting. But he continued to always jump to play with his new friends. I felt like I was always hassling him when I asked to play something.



Eventually I brought up all of my feelings/insecurities about the situation again. I also mentioned how he would respond to messages from the new friends in our chat, but ignore mine. I pointed out that I can see that I was being ignored, and that it made me feel once again, shitty. Like I wasn't good enough even though I try so hard to be a good inclusive friend... After this final chat, he got very defensive and said that he didn't have to justify who he messages (which I do understand) and that he gravitates towards the new people because I always seem too needy.



So I decided it would be best to give myself space and cut off all contact with him for the past month. And it has destroyed me. The whole process, everything that he said that made me feel so little and uncared for. I opened up to him about how I struggled with self-esteem and depression and that that probably contributed to why I felt like crap when he didn't include me. His response was that he didn't have the ""mental capacity to worry how his actions made me feel"".... And I was thinking.. Well most friends generally care if they upset their friends. Intentional or not...  So that's why I decided I needed a break from it all.


Anyway, through all of it so far.. I have just felt like absolute trash. Idk why.. I just try so hard and put 100% into my friendships, am always there for my friends when they need me to vent or talk.. And I just expected the same. And I got treated like my problems weren't important. The first week that I didn't chat with him, I literally was nauseous 24/7.. Couldn't eat.. And lost 10 pounds in a week. It wasn't until this week that I finally started feeling a minuscule fragment of peace... but it always fades. And I fall right back into thinking of everything that happened.. And how I'm just not valued as a friend or person. And that kills me inside. I've always struggled with confidence, depression, and self-esteem.. And it just builds and builds.

He text me this week randomly and just said something like ""hope you're doin fine. Miss playin with ya"". Super short. And part of me does miss my friend. And want this sadness to end and just be friends again. But at the same time, I feel like he just doesn't value me as a true friend and the cycle would repeat. I lose either way.


I've lost a brother-like friend in the past and in did the same thing to me. I take things extremely personal and my brain just ingrains the negative experiences in my mind.. I'm not sure what to do with myself. I've started eating again and gained the weight back. But I don't feel like myself. I'm not actually happy at all. I fake it when I do interact with others. But in my mind, I'm jsut telling myself over and over that I'm a piece of shit that can't even keep his friends... All because of this experience. I'm not sure what I'm hoping to get out of this post.. I'm just really emotional right now and would just love to chat I suppose. Life sucks. And I hate that I can't just make my brain be normal and not care as much. But I can't. I'm a prisoner in my own mind. My mind is literally on this topic 24/7. I wake up and go to bed thinking about it and cry a lot.",09Mar2020,1

It doesn't really make sense, cause my logic-y bits just shut off... or, they don't shut off, but everything else shuts off, leaving only my logic-y bits. I don't know. It's like not having emotions, but not like the depression emotionlessness that hurts a bit for a really long time. It's more like complete and utter neutrality. Like you're not a person anymore, just a robot acting on your rules. For me, not only do I see myself as a robot, but everyone else, too. Everyone's just a robot, acting out their program, even if they don't know it. They'll smile, and laugh and converse with each other, but there's no choice in it. Of course they're going to do that. That's what they always do. Of course I'm going to think this. That's what I always think. And I feel scared, but I don't. I register that something is very very wrong, and I should be freaking out, but the panic is locked away behind some glass, and I can look at it, and think ""I should be feeling that"" and I'm not and it should be scary, but it's empty.

75,"I dunno what is the problem I seem to have is called, so I dunno which related sub I should post this on. I don't think I can make a TL;DR version of this, as I need to show some example of my situation.

Lately, I seem to have trouble controlling my emotions, and it actually goes both ways. A small event that would normally only midly annoy me now makes me livid. Oh the other hand, an small event that would only get me smile a bit instead makes me incredibly happy for not real reason. Something that usually only makes me slightly sad or disapointed now makes me cry, and so on... I dunno if that can help figuring out stuff, but here are a few examples of recent events (all of tehse happened within the last 2 weeks)

-My boss aske me and my two night shift co-worker to do an extra task. With our old system, this would have been easy AF, but the new system we got about 6 weeks ago is far more complicated to use. Fortunately, where there are no errors in the customers's file, this is still a relatively easy task, but when we have a mistake to correct... on the old system, those mistake would take 1 minutes to fix, on the new system, it literally takes 10 times as much to fix them. Happened to me twice. Normally, I'd just notice that to my manager, but both time, I actually got mad at her. even though it's not entirely her fault.

-Just talking about a dream that made me cry in 2016 made me cry harder las week.

-One of my aquintance got his second child recently. I've known the guy for almost 15 years, but we were never really friends. Nonetheless, when we meet randomly (which happens fairly often in the bus) we talk and asks for each other's news. When I learned he had his second child, for no apparentlt reasons, I felt like the happiest man in the world, as if **I** was the one who had a child.

-My coworker politely pointed out a mistake I made earlier today. I thanked him, corrected said mistake, and said I'd be more careful. But despite my coworker being super polite about the whole thing (and the mistake itself being quite minor), I somehow felt like an incompetent piece of shit. I feel like crying for no reasons right now.

-Yesterday, I read the whole 45 chapters of a webcomic I discovered. Long story short, the main protagonist was wronged by both of the female lead, and the story kind of ended like that. The ending sucked, but yet, I felt as angry as if the whole story happened to mybest friend, or something.

-A game I was looking forward to play was released this weekend. I was looking forward to play, but at the same time, it wasn't the Game of the Year I was waiting for. And yet, I've rarely been this excited to play a game like that.

-My girlfriend has some health problems. Not life threatening, but it still sucks. Despite all that, she managed to laugh it off and even *joke* about it to the point she made me laugh more than she usually do with her jokes

-Talking about jokes, my best friend happens to be one of my corworker I mentied. He's quite the joker, and he always manage to make me laugh... and once again, he did make me laugh. At least twice as usual.

So yeah, these are example of what happens to me emotionally lately. I don't react the opposite way (Something that usually makes me laugh now makes me sad) but it's more like I show ,y emotions a **LOT** more. And it kinda maked e feel weird. I also don't switch mood on a whim like that. There actually has to be something to trigger my mood change. Basically, I feel like a piece of shit right now because of the mistake I made earlier today, and I'll probably keep feeling that way until I either go to sleep, or something that makes me smile/laugh happens.

Ive dealt with severe anxiety for a couple years now and I understand my own anxiety enough to know when an attack is coming or if my anxiety is being triggered by something in particular rather than just an episode, though something thats always happened to me that i've never really understood is the feeling in my hands that I ALWAYS get. 

I keep forgetting to ask my doctor about it but I have an exam tomorrow (a known trigger for my anxiety) and was getting the feeling again today. Ive always been told that your hands go ""numb"" when your anxiety spikes but it dosen't feel like that for me. My hands ache and become really weak. they become overly sensitive in comparison to being numb. They tingle but not in a pins and needles type of way, more in an aching type of way.

78,"Let me preface my long post by saying that as a former crisis line volunteer, I have to uphold the rule and moral code of privacy and will not be sharing any specific stories of any callers. Crisis lines must uphold the privacy of the callers so that they feel safe calling in. What I can do, however, is share generalizations and typical kinds of calls. So, if any of you reading find yourself in anything I have written, please know that this means you are far from being alone. Many people call crisis lines with the same issues. And, the reason I want to share this information is that I think it can help people as it has helped me become a better, more empathetic partner, friend, teacher, and family member. Honestly, the training and the openness of the callers taught me so much that I feel like I am a better human being than I was before. I am thankful for all the callers I talked to who educated me with their personal experiences and have allowed me to become a better human being having learned from them.

I am extremely verbose, so I will be making bold headings for specific things. Feel free to read only what interests you. 

In no particular order, I learned:

1. **A surprising number of calls are made because the people are lonely or isolated**. **We can help loved ones by scheduling regular contact when convenient.**

The assumption everyone makes about crisis lines is that it is one suicidal caller after another. However, that is far from the case. Those calls, although daily, were actually few in comparison. Our callers were lonely or isolated for a long list of reasons including: 

· Not knowing how to meaningfully connect to family, 

· Having trouble making friends because of their health or mental health issues, 

· Being new to town,

· Not feeling able to talk about their problems with friends/family,

· The people in their lives not being understanding and/or being super judgemental of them,

· Being unable to leave their homes because of health or mental health conditions,

· Going through grief because of a loss (be it the loss of a loved on or a breakup),

What I learned from this is that a greater effort needs to be made to spend consistent time with those who we know are struggling, if we can and it doesn’t harm us. A weekly dinner, a weekly call, a weekly visit, etc.. are small things that can be scheduled to make them a priority and give the lonely/isolated person something to look forward to. A day they know they will have company, makes the other days easier as they are looking forward to the dinner, call, visit, etc. Those callers seemed to be better equipped to deal with their days than the ones who had no idea when and if they would have some company. 

If you are the lonely/isolated person, it is something that can be asked for. Sometimes family members or friends want to help, but don’t know how. Asking them for the minimum, a weekly call, on a time and day that generally works for them can be a more useful way to get some company than just guilting or complaining that you’re lonely. 

This suggestion doesn’t cover some of the issues callers had on the list for why they were lonely, but I will address more of those further down. 

**2.** **Many people need to talk/vent in order to get through the turbulent emotions they are feeling. Once they calm down, they might be able to come up with solutions or problem solve. We do not (and most often, cannot) solve people’s problems for them.**

The goal of a crisis line is to help people through the crisis moment. Not to give advice or solve their problems. Whatever the crisis is, which is defined by the person, it is a moment of turbulent emotions and chaotic thoughts during which one cannot effectively use their logic, among other issues. So, when someone opens up to you and is emotional, don’t step in instantly wanting to find solutions. Often, that is not what they need in that moment. They need to get through that whirlwind and calm down. Often, that can be achieved through active listening and empathy. 

In active listening, you don’t hold on to gold nuggets of things you want to say when given a chance, as this means you are, in fact, NOT listening. Rather, you let go of your own thoughts, ideas, solutions for them, etc. and listen. Then, you paraphrase to make sure you understood. You don’t parrot back (say the same thing in the same words) rather you say it with your own words and check with that person if you are correct. If not, you can ask for clarification to understand what is happening. If you manage to do this well, a person generally feels heard and understood and is more likely to calm down. At this point, that might be the most that can be done. However, then you can ask them if they want to problem solve or if they just needed to vent. This gives the power back to the person in crisis. And this is what we want, we want to empower people.

A lot of people mistakenly believe that when someone opens up to them, they need to offer that person solutions. It’s a huge disconnect. It implies to the person in crisis that their emotions are not warranted as a simple solution is available. This will often make people in crisis feel worse and get more emotional while their confidante is confused about what went wrong. If you’re not sure what someone needs in the moment, simply ask “Do you need to talk or problem solve?”

**3.** **Pain blocks other thoughts. If someone you know is in pain, you cannot expect them to simply talk about something else.**

I received a surprising number of calls from people dealing with physical pain from a variety of injuries, medical conditions, treatments, or even medications. These callers opened up and explained to me about their desperate loneliness caused by the fact that they cannot think of anything else but they pain they are in. 

Think about the most pain you’ve ever experienced. In that moment, would you have been able to focus on someone’s story about their fun weekend? Would you have been able to tell a fun, light-hearted story that is interesting to your friends or family members? If you’ve never experienced the kind of pain that blocks out your ability to think of anything else but the pain, count yourself lucky and hope that you never truly understand what that means. The callers went through this kind of pain either constantly, or very often. The callers told me about how the people that loved them most lost patience with them, didn’t want to hear about their pain anymore, wanted to talk about ANYTHING else, and usually just minimized contact. Their loved ones seemed simply not to believe them that they couldn’t talk about something else. And, got annoyed that they weren’t even “trying.” But, despite their pain, they didn’t want to be alone all the time. The loneliness caused a whole other pain and desperation in them. So, they called us and we would listen to their pain because that was all they could talk about despite, themselves, wishing they could talk or think about anything else.

Personally, knowing this helped me deal with my husband before he had back surgery. I was able to sit through his constant descriptions of what hurt, what was hard to do, what he wished he could do, etc... I understood that there was no option for him. There was no ability for him to think of anything else. At times that the pain was less, he did like to be distracted. But, I couldn’t hold it against him when he was incapable. There was a lot of just being there so he wouldn’t be lonely. It hurt me that I couldn’t take the pain away and was torturous to see him like that. But, knowing that being there helped, though imperceptibly, and knowing I had to keep myself entertained with watching Netflix or reading, made it easier for me to deal with those months before his surgery. It was extremely hard on me, too. And, I also needed to give myself outlets and people to talk to and I needed my own support. But, had I not had the experience from the crisis line, I do not think I would have been quite so understanding or helpful to my partner. 

**4.** **Those positivism we were all taught to say to those going through rough times can be extremely destructive as they often cause people who need to talk to stop talking because they feel that you don’t/won’t understand.**

When we went through the crisis line training, we were taught to NEVER say things like:

“It’ll get better,” 

“It might not be as bad as you think,” 

“Why don’t you just \_\_\_\_,” 

“Just focus on the positive,” etc.. 

First and foremost, we have no real way of knowing for sure things will get better for people. A lot of people are facing a big downhill in their lives that they are aware is coming. Be it a decline in health, be it a different lifestyle after retiring/losing a job, be it their mental health issues being a long-term battle, be it their family being truly terrible people, be it financial issues, etc… We cannot predict the future when talking to someone and, therefore, cannot brush off what they are going through with some sentence that could be said to anyone experiencing anything difficult. There are people whose health will not get better. There are people whose families will never see the light. There are people who will struggle every month for the rest of their lives to pay rent and be in constant fear of homelessness. These truths are uncomfortable when listening to them for anyone. The problem with saying these ""positivisms"" to people is that they minimize what people are going through, while simultaneously demonstrating to those people that we don’t believe the depth of their struggles. It’s a fast way to shut someone up who might really need to talk. Saying those things, will often have people feel that what you are thinking is “Your problem isn’t really a big deal, and you should stop complaining,” even if that is not what you are thinking when you say those things. It takes time and effort to stop saying them because they are so ingrained in us. 

If you don’t know what to say in response to someone opening up about their really tough situation(s), here are some standbys that are more useful:

· That sucks.

· I’m so sorry you’re going through that. Is there anything I can do to actually help with that, or do you just need to vent?

· You’re going through something very hard. What do you need from me?

· That’s really hard. 

The reason these are better, is that they don’t minimize what they are going through. They don’t make the person feel they need to stop talking, if that is what they need. The harsh reality is that there are people out there with situations that will always be hard. And, they need still support to get through it. This means, they will often have to say the same things about the same situation when they need to vent. If you want to include something at all positive in these kinds of conversations, you can try asking what the most positive, or least negative thing they experienced recently was. If they had something good or fun happen. Try to do this near the end of the conversation, if it works, this could help them re-focus after venting to something actually positive. This can backfire though, so be careful about it. 

**5.** **People going through a breakup think obsessively about it and struggle to think/talk about anything else as a breakup is as painful as the death of a loved one. They can’t “just get over it.”** 

A lot of our callers were going through break-ups. And, they called us because their friends were sick of hearing them talk about their exes. After hearing so many calls about this, it’s become clear to me that they simply cannot talk or think about anything else for a quite while, longer than most of those around them think is reasonable. And, telling someone who is annoying you by obsessively talking about their ex that it’s getting old, or they should be over it by now might get them to shut up in that moment. But, it will not help them through it nor make it go faster. 

I did some research about break ups a while ago and there is evidence that they are as painful as the death of a loved one. And, it’s not necessarily just break ups for long-term relationships. Anyone who felt very connected and truly in love with someone, even in a short relationship, will suffer like someone died. And, a “reasonable” time for them to truly “get over it” is actually closer to 4 years. That doesn’t mean they will not date or whatever for so long. But, that person will be on their mind and they are likely to be destabilized in that time. Of course, lessening with time. 

So, it’s good to keep in mind that your loved ones who are again talking about their ex might not be able to talk about anything else for a longer than expected time. Yes, it can get frustrating to hear about that so often. But, rather than in a frustrated voice telling them something ultimately harmful. You can say something more constructive like:

“I know this break up is hard. And, I know it will take a long time for you to be able to even think about something else. I want to support you, however it’s been hard on me hearing about it so much. Can we take a break and try some distraction? Can we watch a movie, go on a walk, go out for dinner, etc..?” That is a much kinder way of telling someone you need a break from that topic without making them feel they don’t have your support. 

**6.** **Loved ones putting up boundaries mean they want to still be in contact with you, not that they don’t want to talk to you anymore.**

A lot of our callers were people with long-term difficulties. Many had mental health issues and were not always easy for their family/friends to be around. And, in an attempt for self-care family/friends would set up some boundaries. Callers often felt so hurt by this. For the callers, they felt it confirmed their fears of being unlovable or simply “too much” for people to handle. The flip side that many of them struggled to realize was that their loved ones were put in a position where the caller was most often the one with some issue and the relationship had become one-sided. The loved ones who were relatively doing better than the callers also had their own difficulties, trials, hard times, and needed to take care of themselves as well. The ones who put boundaries of how often they could talk were trying to respectfully give as much as they could while also taking care of themselves. A boundary is not saying “I don’t care and I don’t want to talk to you.” Rather, it is saying “I care, and this is what I can give without harming myself.” If someone sets a boundary with you, it is that person’s attempt to help you and find balance to help themselves. Remember, many of them can simply cut off contact. The fact that they haven’t chosen to do so means they want to be there. 

Some of the callers were the boundary setters calling because of the guilt they felt and being unsure if they had done the right thing. Other callers who had boundaries set on them were more understanding and respected the boundaries calling us on days that they needed support but also needed to respect their loved ones. Those who understood what the boundaries meant, seemed to fair far better and have better, more positive interactions with their loved ones. 

**7.** **The more one talks about dying by suicide, the farther along the path towards suicide they are. However, the more used to it their loved ones become and the more likely their loved ones are to think “it’s just talk.”**

This was the most heart-breaking thing I learned from the crisis line training. The first few times someone mentions any intentions of dying by suicide, their loved ones tend to freak out and worry. But, after they hear more and more of it and “nothing” happens, the more they feel it is not serious. This is terrifying because that means they might be missing some important signs as their loved one is getting closer and closer to dying by suicide. If you don’t know what to do, this is an appropriate time to call a crisis line as they will help you problem solve or find resources that you may not know of. It is also a great time for even just a one-off appointment with a mental health professional to find out what to say, do, and which signs to look for. I know these appointments are expensive, but if you can afford one, you might be able to get help that could save a life. You also likely need some support yourself. 

Some of the signs of someone being more serious about suicide include:

· A specific plan

· Access to lethal means (a gun, for example)

· Suddenly giving away their possessions

· Suddenly having energy after being low and depressed for a long time

· Suddenly cleaning or taking care of things they haven’t for a long time

·  A sudden change like a break up, getting kicked out of school, losing a job because of their depression

· Tying up lose ends like going through a list of people to pay money back to or giving back things they borrowed

· Asking questions about which medications or dosages could cause death

One thing to keep in mind if someone opens up to you about suicidal thoughts is that just in talking to you, some part of them doesn’t want to go through with it. If they were 100% serious in that exact moment, they likely would have just gone ahead with it. Sometimes in those moments they need professional help if they are very serious and sometimes, if they are just thinking about it, they need someone to be around. 

**8.** **The directors of these crisis lines are amazingly dedicated, caring, and serious people. The call-takers and all of the volunteers truly care.**

Though I only met 2 directors and this is a generalization, I don’t think crisis lines would be successful if those in charge didn’t really, truly care. Also, many callers believe that they are a burden. But, please know the people taking your calls really want to help and care about the callers. 

Not all people who want to volunteer with a crisis line actually make it through the process. They have to be vetted, interviewed, and then pass training. Many people do not make it through the application or interview, let alone the training. The group at the end of the training process when I was trained was less than half of those that showed up to the first day of training. They pick already empathetic people and then train them to make sure to follow a protocol set out to help people make it through a crisis. People come through the training with a new level empathy. 

When I went through the training it went like this: We first learned a lot of material, then we listened in on some calls and discussed what the call-taker did. We then had practice scenarios with crisis line volunteers pretending to be callers and discussed how we did and what we could do better. At this point, some of the would-be volunteers realized it was not a good fit for them or the trainers realized this and they left or were cut from the remaining training. Then we had live calls with someone there to whisper in our ears, if needed. The trainers gradually stepped back and allowed us to do more on our own. Of course, stepping in if and when needed. Once the trainers felt we had a handle on it, we were given some longer training shifts where there was someone on duty in the room to help mentor us. After all of that was passed, we managed to go through the whole process. Now, once the initial training is complete, learning is never done. Between calls we had assignments and materials to read. However, the call-takers are just empathetic people given some training. Call-takers are not mental health professionals who are qualified to give advice in the same way a counselor, psychologist, or psychiatrist would be. 

**9.** **When you do give advice, make sure it is wanted and always remember it is up to the person getting the advice to evaluate whether or not it would be useful for them.**

So, as I mentioned above, sometimes people need to vent and do not want any advice. Unwanted advice can actually grate on their nerves as it makes them feel unheard. 

So, if someone asks for advice or you check and find out they would like advice, there are things to keep in mind. 

· As much as you know about the person, you don’t know everything. It is easy to judge what is going on from the outside and think you have a viable solution, but not understand certain complexities or issues that might make your solution unworkable. 

· The easiest way to show you understand it’s up to them whether or not to take it (and remind yourself of that fact as well) is to attach “is that doable?” after. This gives the person a chance to evaluate and, if needed, reject your advice. It is their right to do so. 

· If you are interested in why your advice was rejected, you can respectfully ask something like “I would still like to help out, so it would be useful for me to know why that idea wouldn’t work for you, if you feel able to explain it.” This gives them a chance to explain, if they want to. While respecting anything they choose to do is 100% up to them. Give them the benefit of the doubt that they want the best for themselves and will take advice that suits them, their situation, and the others involved.

My goal in making this post was to help. So, if anything I have written was helpful, I'm glad. Also, don't be afraid to call crisis lines 24/7. They might have a lack of volunteers, meaning you might not get through every time, but the people there do care and want to help.",09Mar2020,1
79,"Hey, so over the past 3-4 years my mentality has remained generally in tact. Though, things seem different now. I used to be very energetic; almost high on life. But now I find it very hard to rekindle that feeling. One of the main points I go to is my empathy. Some days, I feel for all that are around me. I feel selfless and get a great sense of satisfaction when I’ve gone above and beyond morally. Other days, I feel very paranoid and selfish. It’s almost like I feel as though the ones I trust will betray me. In my past I’ve had a lot of that happen. In my youth, my mother went down a deep spiral of OCD and anxiety. Her episodes would terrify me and I wanted to be away from her due to the fear and her not letting me live a normal childhood. When my dad divorced her when I was 9, I felt good. In middle school I was about 50/50 when it came to being social. I was getting the hang of it (after not having any sort of frame-work due to my mother keeping me indoors constantly), but it always felt like a chore. Something I’d have to do to keep appearances. In late middle school and high school, I became very social. This is where I felt the pinnacle of my natural happiness; which I define as me feeling good without need from any outside stimuli if that makes sense. When I was 17, my dad was prompted to kick me out by my stepmom. I felt betrayed by him because I always looked up to him. From then I lived with my grandma and aunt, and graduated from highschool later that year. I moved back to my hometown but lived with my girlfriend for about a year. She ended up cheating on me after we had been dating for a year and a half. It was awful, but a defining moment in my life. I had never felt so alone. Because I invested a lot into it, and didn’t know how to feel myself. Surprisingly, I got over that specific feeling in about a week or two. This is where things got dicey for me. At that point I was 19, now I am 21. I continued to work and really had some bright moments mentally. I felt free. I felt content with myself. I have always believed in myself, but lately I crave for a fix to all of this uncertainty in my mind. Work kept my mind off of things. But after saving up a decent amount of money, I decided to cut my hours. From then on out, I would feel great in the mornings, and then I would get home after my shift (@ 2:30 p.m.) and feel exhausted. This cycle has continued for quite some time. I feel at my best when I am able to wake up relatively early, go through my entire day without this overwhelming sense of being tired, and go to bed at around 11:00 p.m. But back to what I was saying. When I’d get home from work, I’d nap for a long time. It was mainly due to how I felt when I was tired. I love being outside, I love exploring, and socializing. But the “me” that I am when I’m tired like this is not something I am proud of. I’m not particularly rude, but I’m just quiet and unimpressive by my standards. I feel stoic and unmotivated. So I’d seek comfort in sleeping and waking up feeling at least lukewarm. I’d wake up at 6-7 p.m. and eat. From then on out, I’d spend the rest of my night too unmotivated to really do anything that means anything to me, but I’d feel too physically awake to sleep. This brought forth a lot of nights where my mind felt hopeless. I then went to go see a doctor. They tested my levels and said that I had high red blood cell count and hemoglobin levels. Thus, they were concerned that I had Polycythemia Vera (some sort of a blood cancer). I did panic, but I also was relieved because I almost wanted my life to not be lived out to the full length. They did a second test, turns out I didn’t have it. I want to go back to the doctor, but honestly the lack of motivation coupled with the fear that I dealt with (going for my first checkup in ages and having that false alarm) has made it difficult to go about seeing what’s causing my low energy. I since have moved to a different state. And to top it all off, I lost a lot of my friends due to my roommates telling one of my friends that I stole one of his belongings in my move. Yet another example of being backstabbed. I assumed they did this because they thought the thing was mine and sold it. When confronted, they all three blamed me and told the friend who owned the item this. On the bright side, I did not steal it, and have photographs to support my claim, but come on. I was baffled that this even happened to me. So now I am a point where I virtually have no friends, and rarely reach out to family. I feel alone, but normally I overcame this through the power of self love. I no longer have this. At least at the same intensity that I used to. I don’t know what to do, and I would be forever grateful if someone could try and steer me in the right direction. I know this is long, but I tried not to leave much out.

82,"Hey so uhhh I feel I should preface this by saying I’m not looking for a full on diagnosis. I’m just curious to hear what others think of it.

So I’ll start by explaining who this voice is. Ever since I was a kid, probably 11 or so, I’ve had this voice in my head. The first time I recollect him appearing was when my parents were fighting in the next room over while I was in the closet. While I couldn’t see him, I visualized him holding me close and protecting me. Ever since he appears for three situations, when I’m under high levels of stress, when I try to sleep, and when I haven’t been able to sleep. I’ve even had full on conversations with him before, talking about our relationship. He’s put some negative thoughts in my head before, of hurting others, but I’m pretty sure he’s doing it out of protection.

Interesting details about him: I’m female, but the voice has always presented male. I feel it’s part of the reason I feel so strange about my gender identity. I was an only child so I think he’s meant to be an older brother to me, if I were to give him a role. He’s separate from me, I think.

Anyway, if anyone has anything to share, I’d love to hear it! I’m really nervous to bring it up to my therapist, because despite everything I care about him and he’s helped me through so much and I’m afraid she’ll say he’s not good to have around

I went to the doctors about it, and they said it was from being tired and not getting enough sleep, which I don't. I got some medication to help me sleep but somehow after getting better sleep I feel much more exhausted than usual. I went again and they have suggested I see a psychologist, but sessions are taking months to go to and it's seemingly getting worse. I just don't like myself. I can't feel happy, and if I do it only lasts for a few seconds before completely going away. It's like I'm being forced to feel this way.

85," I have been in therapy for Depression, Psychosis and OCD for the past 3 years, my new therapist suggested that I might have bipolar II because I told here that I experience certain highs from time to time.

So here are my symptoms while depressed: I don't talk a lot of I do really quiet, I lose my motivation and interests, suicidal thoughts, self harm (punching walls, pinching my skin, alcohol), feeling agressive and empty, overthinking, lack of sleep/too much sleep

Here are the symptoms while I experience those highs: I'm thinking everything I'm doing is right, I act really hyperactive, I talk too much, I feel the need to talk so much, I drink a lot of alcohol, I have to move and do a lot of sport (I once stood up in class to do push ups while having one of those phases), I move really agressive sometimes, I get really stupid but creative Ideas.

I should add that when I was 15 I had a phase where I seriously believed I was the antichrist or something and did other drugs besides alcohol which resulted into some kind of psychosis with paranoid schizophrenic symptoms (they dissapeared after 8 months or so)

87,"Ok so, this is a whole effing essay because guess who's procrastinating again?  
But basically:  
Went to the dog with thinking I had ADD.  
Got kind of dismissed, they said 'might just be your social anxiety, why do you even need a label, people with ADD don't get grades that high usually'  
Had another talk with my doc, who wasnt sure what else she could help me with besides my social anxiety. Broke down crying because I love my parents and don't want them to ever die, and mentioned I often just get scared with no reason. She said she could help me with that.  
Then got diagnosed with ADD by people who actually know something.   
But now that I know my doc was wrong in a lot of ways, that mum apperently didnt get a nice vibe from her (and me neither but I usually kind of see through that), that I should probably talk to a real psychologist according to best friend, and now that I know how effing nice therapists can be (the ones who diagnosed me felt like friends), I don't want to go back? But she said she can help me with my 'new' problem. So. Advice?  


The whole damn thing because apperently I had a lot of time on my hands:

  
I got very distracted when I tried to study. I studied HARD, like from the beginning of the semester to the end, summarising a chapter a day which sometimes took 3 hours but sometimes with all my getting distracted and stressed 8. So in the end I got good grades (my average right now is an 8 and I know that's a little above average but I've never been so good at something so I wanna keep it up).  
Went to a talky person at our local doctorclinic (not sure what to call it). I mentioned I've already been diagnosed with social anxiety years ago, and basically what she said was 'well those symptoms you're experiencing could just be because of your anxiety, don't you think? That you think too much about everything nd get distracted because of that (which would make sense in the work environment where I always made very stupid mistakes, especially when there were lots of people around or bossy people who critisized me on everything I did, that I either was way too slow or not precise enough). But it happens when I'm home too, when it's just my dad across the table doing his own work and me behind my laptopn TRYing to study but getting distracted by not even specific things, but just dozing off, being tired, resting my head for a second- OOPS I mean an hour, just blankly staring ahead, staring at a picture in a book without taking it actually in... That.

  
But I'm very persuadable so... I went along with it. She should know, right? I mean she studied psychology (like me, btw, I'm a first year student, woooooh, it's super interesting and- well anyway).  
It kind of made sense what she was saying. And she is nice-ish, though I feel like she didn't really like me. She acted nice though. But so, her plan was, help me with me social anxiety and maybe it'll be better.

  
Well I didn't really do anything she said, like I wanted to join a choir but thought it was scary to go all alone and she said just try it out and I was like YEAH BUT... School stuff too, like I dont have time, my schedule always changes, often I have class in the evening, like... Yeah. But I really wanted to try it. And then my best friend and I took a dance workshop to try different dances, and it was so fun, and she was like 'we could do something together, or maybe acting' and I was like YES because I've always wanted to try that but like... not alone. But because of my STUPID ASS SCHEDULE I often have school in the evening and so if I have 10 classes (its just a course for beginners, ten times) I'd have to miss about 5 of them while still paying about 200 euros and like... That's a lot of money to throw away. So I can't do that. But then my doc was like 'well... Maybe you can spend less time on school. School is important, but if everyone else gets by with just a summary from the internet, why wouldn't you?' and I was like 'yes but what if I dont, I dont wanna spend extra time in summer STUDYING' and she was like 'You could try for just one course' and I did because its unclear what we should read for one subject because the teacher said we could use older books too but then theres NO INFO on what pages correspond to which chapters we have to know, so now I'm stressing the heck out and wasting my time on this essay. Anyway. So. That. Uhm. My point...

  
I didn't really agree with her, I guess, I just went along with it. But then I got a soft of anxiety attack (maybe? Like... I didn't hyperventalate, which I know isn't always the case with anxiety attacks, but I just stared ahead when I was studying and read over the same part over and over and over and then my mum asked 'and how's it going'  and I was like .....uhm... o-ok... and then I effing broke down crying and my dad tried to comfort me but I didn't want him to see me crying so I kind of just... very quickly said I was ok and waved him off and I still feel bad about that) and then when I had kind of calmed down, my parents were discussing ADD, that I always got so distracted when studying, and apperently my old psychologist mentioned ADD but then when she found out I was doing well in school she was like 'Oh that's odd, I thought she might have ADD but if she does well in school then that's probably not the case'. She was very

 nice though. And turns out she was right after all. Kind of wish I could tell her that hahaha.   
Ok but anyway. My parents also mentioned that two of my nieces had ADD and ADHD. So they suggested maybe I should talk to the doc and ask again. So I did.

  
She mentioned that it might just be my anxiety, but she had a test I could do to see if I COULD have ADD. But the test was so floppy:( Like... 3/10 questions I didn't really understand what they meant, or I was like 'well I have that... But only sometimes, I think? Or only in those situations', so I completely flunked it, and in the end it turned out I had maybe 1/5 point too little to be considered for an official diagnose test. And when I did the test, afterwards the doc said 'usually people with ADD can't focus that well on a test like this' which took only maybe five minutes to fill out and helloooo? There's no other distractions in that tiny room and she was waiting for me to finish the thing (while doing her own work in the computer) so of course I'm not gonna just stare out the window and do nothing. Also because there was no window. 

  
I didn't feel good about it though. I made lots of other stupid mistakes at work, still got distracted a lot, felt dense all the time, and then when I mentioned to my parents I might have filled out the test wrong (like I'm not distracted ALL the time, just often when I study. And maybe other times), my mum said  something along the lines of 'Honey, you get distracted all the time. Even when you were little, during dance recital you would stand up while everyone sat, you would look somewhere else while the rest was dancing, I always had to remind you to keep watching where you're riding your bike because you got distracted by everything you saw, all your teachers called you a dreamer... Need I go on?'

&amp;#x200B;

So I went back. To our family doc this time, and what he said was 'Well, you're not impulsive (I'd just said that), you're sometimes distracted (me and my fudging sugarcoating), and you don't have this (dont remember what, but I guess irritatability, maybe? I just dont really get angry, ever) (unless you hurt an animal. Or kid or an old person. Or anyone really).  so you probably don't have ADD. Even though people with ADD tend to have less impulsivity that people with ADHD. And then he went on 'and what happens when you get diagnosed? What would you want to happen? Surely not  
 \~ medication \~ right? And I kind of nodded along but in my head I was like 'well... If it helps? Sure!'  
And then he was like 'and why would you even want a label? Here we're trying to do away with labels and focus on the real problem, and if your problem is distractibility, you should maybe try to work on that. And then in my head I was like '... But if you know the problem, aka ADD maybe, you can solve it better, right?' but I didnt say it and kind of just left after that to talk to my parents.  


And then my mum went with me to my 'therapy session' and we ended up getting a reference because 'if we REALLY wanted it, we'll give you one'. Also, yesterday she told me she didn't really like the lady. Especially not compared to the people who ACTUALLy diagnosed me because holy crap it felt like the most happy place on earth there and I felt so at home there as if I'd known those people for years and holy shit can I just come there every week please?  


Then the appointment after, but before the diagnose, I was just finished with the exams. Got great grades (like 7.5/10, 8/10. one even 8,5/10) (but I fudging studied A LOT) and then the lady doc was like 'Well, congrats! That's great to hear. I do have to say though... Usually people with ADD don't get grades that are so great.' Then I mentioned my friend from school, who (says she) doesn't do SHIT for school because she always puts everything off, and she has ADD. She says she usually starts like four days beforehand, having done maybe two chapters of reading or skimming the summaries, and she ends up getting 6 or 7/10 most of the time, while I spend HOURS every day studying and only get 1 point or 2 higher. And my doc was like 'yes but there's always exceptions of course. And ADD is different for everyone'.  
...  
THEN WHY WOULD THAT NOT BE THE CASE WITH ME. WHYYY.

Welp turns out I do have ADD, or at least, the diagnose says so. Like. I did a LOT worse on a test, we had to like, click a button at certain moments, and while most people missed maybe 5 out of 140, I missed 28 times and also had about 8 wrong ones. And then I got me some meds and I only missed 5 when I did the test again.  


so yeah there's that. Oh yeah and the point of this essay:   


My last appointment with the doc was two days before the ADD test, and I'm not a talker and so when I said everything was ok, except I'm really stressed but I KNOW its gonna turn out allright because it always does, it's just in my head, but the stress it there, she was like...  
'So I'm not really sure what to help you with more. You say everything's gonna be all right, and you know that it's just in your head, so everything's ok. So what else is there?'  
And I'd been thinking about my darker thoughts lately. Like, from when I was little I would sometimes get in bed, and then think 'my parents are gonna die one day' and then I could get the image of them in a coffin out of my head and I'd stay awake to make sure they wouldnt get a random heart attack or something, at least until they were safely upstairs in their bed, and I still sometimes have that. Not the staying up on purpose part, but the 'shit they're gonna be gone one day and I have no other family besides my siblings because we dont really talk to the rest of the family and they could just die tomorrow like get in an accident and they wnt even know how much I love them and holy shit Im such a dissapointment to them probably what with all my mental health shit and spiral spiral spiral CRYING.  


So I mentioned that to my doc, felt a tear slip and then I effing broke lose and cried and in the end she said she thought she could help me with my problems about leaving my parents. 

But now that I know that she and the other doc where effing WRONG about my whole ADD thing, and now that I know my mum didn't really like her in the first place (like I didnt get a great vibe from the doc either but she was kind of nice I guess) and that I can only see the doc once every month if Im lucky because shes so busy and I have school all the time, and since my best friend mentioned I should maybe talk to a real psychologist, I kind of... DOn't wanna go back? But Im still with the parents problem so... And she said she could help me.   
But compared to the people who diagnosed me, her vibe was way less... nice. Like... The people there I felt like I could just hug the heck out of, they were so nice and sweet and I immidiately felt at ease and ugh... I love that place.  


So that's my problem.",09Mar2020,1

89,"I thought my brain wasn't weird but when I talked to a friend they seemed really concerned about it. Basically I told them that my brain kinda has two parts, one which is unfiltered and emotional which I try to ignore or drown out, and another that is unemotional and reasonable which I try to let control what happens, I am still able to feel stuff but if the part of my brain that is illogical becomes too pervasive the part of the brain that is more logical will try to shut it down. However the logical part of the brain isn't that logical at times as it procrastinates a lot and often suggests self harm as a ""more practical alternative"" to emotion. The self harm part I realise is bad and I try to let the emotional side lead more in those times, however the logical brain is often pervasive then. Overall though the logical side is helpful in providing unbiased judgement and processing information. I thought that everyone's brain worked like this other than the self harm thing, but when I asked my friends if their brain sort of did the filter two part thing and they all seemed confused.

92,"I figure Reddit isn't the right place for advices but at least a channel where there might eventually be someone there who might tumble across this. 

I have no friends. And the last time we recounted our problems to an acquaintance, we were told to be assholes by someone guy who has no experience with children. 

When I started realizing that my (once) so desired child is the reason why my SO is losing his job, I decided to give in everything I could to provide SO with a conducive environment to salvage his career. Instead, all I have received this far has been nothing but reproches. 

Background
We have got a 20 months old, very active little boy that refuses to take naps even as he shows signs of fatigue (he gets super unruly, unmanageable). He is awake 16 hours a day and sleeps a mere 8 at night.

My SO started his current job when he was 3 months old, needless to say. I was scared shitless to be left alone with a newborn (we do not have any reliable family or friend). And very often, I would have to recall my SO back from work because it was just mentally impossible for me to handle this child alone. I suspect myself to have severe PTSD and depression that never intensified with this child. I could never seek help because 1) the psychiatrist refuses to prescribe breastfeeding women medication 2) I hardly have the time to ever get out to seek help from a therapist or whatever.

So anyway, my SO was denied a long term contract at the end of the yearbmainly because of all the problems we have with this child. I feel solely responsible for not being able to single handedly contain this child while he was at work. My SO was subsequently granted another year on probation which started out very badly.

The only solution that we are presented with is him passing an exam to have a fresh start in a different place. Said exam is in 3 weeks and I am trying to keep the little one in line and all while SO tries working.

Things are bad enough basically. He barges in each time when our child cries, every 2 minutes or so.

We have consulted our pediatrician who had advised us to leave him crying for him to settle in because so far nothing has worked. And the thing left to do is to leave him alone in bed. 

I'm just trying to salvage and liberate my SO from my child who is monopolizing him all day long. I know how much this exam means to my SO, it is the livelihood of the family.

I feel guilty because my child is tearing apart everything that is left of us.

I know things have been difficult for my SO too, after spending 2 probationary years with very hostile people. I am just trying to put things on track but nothing seems to be working.

The child tells for his father and that's it!!!
I tried putting him to bed, he yells, knowing that my SO would come to his rescue and that's it, everything goes down the drain.

93,"Is there anyone here who constantly thinks about killing himself because of different reasons, not necessarily life-altering or life problems but just small reasons like family problems, school problems. How do you cope? It’s getting hard for me and I don’t think I can last long anymore as I recently fucked up on school. I keep thinking to just do it but then think if such a reason is enough as it was my action that led to me fucking up. Even before fucking up though i already constantly think of killing myself.

Then during breakfast I suddenly fall in hole feel sad for basically kicking her out (before that I just knew I should feel bad but didn't really) so I turn on some quiet music feeling like I am about to cry (which I never do) only to start dancing around the kitchen and being all amped up again.

97,"So about 2 months ago I got a call from my brother (29) who told me he was about to kill himself and that he needed my help.  

I dont want to go into everything but basically he has been really struggling for the last 5 years, made multiple attempts on his life including jumping of a bridge and overdosing on painkillers, his relationships with his wife had been totally breaking down and she has been emotionally manipulating and abusing him whilt keeping control of all thier finanaces so he has felt very trapped. He also has autims and whilst he is very high functioning, he has gotten to the point where she had made him feel that he can't cope without her help and his anxiety has stopped him from being able to leave his house or be around people.

Before he called me I had no idea that any of this was going on. Me and him have been so close for years but he has managed to keep everything hidden from his friends andf family until he basically reached breaking point. For the last 2 months, he has been in a mental health hospital and he had been slowly working on recovering and getting though the crisis point he was at and I am delighted that he is being discharged to a community care team tonight which means he will be able to be at home and get help and support workers coming to see him on a daily basis. 

I have been in the really fortunate postion that i have not be working the last few months so i have lots of free time to visit him in hospital, do his washing, help with dr's and paperwork etc and we have been working on getting him out and about again, taking his dog out for walks and spending time with friend which is all positive but I start a new job tomorrow and I am starting to get a bit worried about how im going to cope. 

I have been dealing with some pretty seriouse issues of my own.  I was in an abusive reationship for almost 10 years which ended when my husband killed himself when I was finally able to see the extent of the abuse and told him that I wanted to leave him.  This happened in Sep 2018 and I am just now starting psycology and grife councling after a pretty massive mental, emotional and psycical breakdown sep 2019 and i know that i have a pretty long way to go myself. 

My brother has told me mulitpul times now that I am basically the only reason he has to keep going and that he doesnt want to put me though anymore than i have already been though. He has aslo said that he feels like he can't do anything unless i am there with him (going outside, being with friends, going to the shops etc) and he doesnt feel like he can do those things with anyone else. So the last thing I want is for him to start feeling that I can't make time for him but I also know that I am really going to struggle when I get back into working. 

Is anyone else in a similar situation? Could really use some advice. Thanks",09Mar2020,1
98,"I space out a lot and have this ‘brain fog’ that I can’t quite explain. It happens a lot and I can’t focus on uni, sometimes my friends would be talking and I realise I’ve just zoned out. It’s the same feeling you get when you’re dreaming and you can’t quite see or think clearly but your body is in autopilot and at times you’re able to reply but as it happens you can’t hear them or make out what they’re saying and you also can’t remember what happened or whether you were coherent. I’m honestly kinda concerned my dudes, is this normal? When I’m in a low mood or have no energy or I’m sad (which is often) or I guess ‘numb’ and lonely I do the same thing. I just zone out, sometimes it’s on purpose and there are times when it’s not. Usually I can’t help it because I find my thoughts and emotions to be too overwhelming, especially this feeling of loneliness. When I was in year 9 I did that a lot, I could literally stare at the wall all day and have no thoughts in my head. Also is it normal to just not think? I have no thoughts in my head most of the time and when people ask questions in lectures my mind would be so surprised like how do they just do that?? It’s hard to explain. My thoughts are only present when I’m extremely anxious and stressed or I force myself to write in a journal so I can get my mind to not be blank but every other time it’s quiet which I think is really concerning. I do feel lonely a lot of the time that I just don’t want to be present.",09Mar2020,1

I also can’t think of a way to properly word out my problems into text, i certainly can type out something that explains the gist of what’s wrong, but I somehow can’t ever be satisfied with the tone of the sentence, even now, hope you guys can get what i mean by this

100,Last Friday my psychologist told me about a program I could take place in I would get groups therapy even week and an individual session ever other week. She know I like being in groups therapy that's probably why she told me. Groups therapy has helped me in the past and I think it's really helpful. The only problem is that I will get another psychologist and I don't know if I want that. I trust my current psychologist completely I tell her every thing and I have no problem being vulnerable with her. I'm just not sure if that will happen again she also told me she finds me a nice client and that she like helping. She said that it wasn't necessary for me to take part in the groep but that she knew that I really want groups therapy. So yeah I hope some of you can give there 2 cent. Because I think it will be fine if I get another psychologist but idk I just really like it with my current psychologist.,09Mar2020,1

102,"Today I hurt my girlfriend so much with my words. For context, I am currently on a leave of absence from school and don't meet my girlfriend often. We went through some horrible times from my emotionalness a few months ago and we're still feeling some pain from then. I easily get angry and sad and that's been causing many issues. This morning, I had been feeling really sad and depressed. Then, my girlfriend sent a message late and so I got sad and anxious. This morning, we planned to have a video call but we weren't able to because other people were in her dorm room today (usually people are out at this time). And so I felt even sadder. So we just chatted instead but she was eating as we chatted so many times I'd wait for a while while we chatted. So I became sad from that again. Then she said she'd take a bath quickly then come back to chat but I waited for 40 minutes and she hadn't come back. Apparently she was getting ready to leave and got dressed and left before messaging me. So I got upset from that and i asked her why she didn't message immediately finishing. Then I went on a run of how I kept being disappointed that morning and how sad I was and how I felt like I couldn't trust her anymore because I feel like I would be let down again. Then I did one of the worst and brought up one time she wasn't able to go by the words she said to me (saying to arrive at some time but arrived an hour later). Then when she had to go, I told her to regain my trust by promising a time we'll talk again after her classes. She said we'd talk at a certain time. But then I fell asleep at that time and let her wait for 2 hours. I told hwe I was so sorry for being late. Then, realizing the pain I caused her this morning, I kept telling her how sorry I was from all the words I'd said. But at this point she was already being mostly emotionless and cold. She said how recently she'd been feeling beat up and spit out emotionally. I ask for her forgiveness but she's having so much trouble forgiving me. I'm so frustrated at myself. Why do I have to hurt the one I love so much because I'm so emotionally unstable. What do I do? I'm trying to get to her but right now she feel uncaring and cold, tired from my shit.

106,"Hi all,

I went on holiday for a long weekend just gone with a handful of my closest friends and came back last night. I am 27 and my last holiday with them was when I was 19 to Magaluf back in 2012 lol. This wasn’t quite the ‘lads holiday’ you have at that age. More a social thing. 

It was enjoyable but now I am home it is a little overwhelming in the fact our circle have all been close friends for over a decade now and time really does fly.

It's kind of hard for me to accept 4 days was more than enough time now - Whereas a week would have been easy a decade ago. I am still keen to party one night every few months and not really drink whereas most of them prefer to drink frequently on weekends and not really party. I've looked after myself a bit better physically so I can still hack the occasional session once every few months. I don't think they can anymore. I spend a majority of my time trying to make my own business work. The way I go about my life is pretty different to my friends and I know they respect me for being myself. 

But times have changed. Nearly all of my friends have all been travelling for a period of time and have come home now. Most of them didn’t go to university, went off and saw the world a bit and never really had a relationship - albeit ones which didn’t last at that. I'm the only one out of all of us that has found a partner. I guess they all got everything they needed to do in their twenties out their system and feel content now. I however, never really had the chance for financial reasons and university  - which I always feel was a waste of my time. I came out of uni and had to work dead end jobs just to pay my way at home. I was never in a position to save. 

I'm trying to tell myself the next decade will be more enjoyable so long as I keep working towards it. The past 10 years have been really up and down for myself. But nothing desires me about the thought of marriage or a mortgage or children or stereotypical things that happen in your thirties that make friendships more of a distraction or less of a priority. 

I know you don't have to do what everyone else is doing. To be honest I hate aging. I've been stuck in a hole since turning 27 last month. I'm grateful my partner feels the same way - bar the ageing factor lol. 

My friends have all got semi decent jobs or a stable income and have now pretty much all returned home and feel comfortable there. I couldn’t think of anything shitter than being my hometown but I can't help but be jealous of their contentedness. I've been chasing wanting to be content for a while and it's a never ending battle. 

I am self employed with a degree I did nothing with as I never had the chance. I moved to London 2 years ago now and I’m 3 1/2 years+ in a happy relationship with someone who I’ve known for over twice that - which I wouldn't trade for the world. She has made be a better person. I earn shit all in the grand scheme of things currently but I’m doing something I enjoy as it’s the only thing that makes getting older enjoyable. The support i've had from my partner is probably better than any therapy i've had in the past decade. 

The friendships I do have here in this city are more working relationships and I find it hard to network and build new friends. It's depressing me now i'm becoming closer to 30 and realise anything social is all a bit limited now as much as I try to make the effort. 

The friends i've made through Instagram and my business aren't the same as the ones you grow up with. I understand that friendships drift apart and other priorities become important with time. As mindful as I try to be, I don't deal well with time changing. I don’t work in an office anymore so it’s not like I have any work mates. I’m also an only child so I don’t have a brother or sister to confine in. 

It saddens me that I never had the money to travel because of a bunch of dead end jobs and that I have a partner that has a comfortable career and no desire to put that on the back burner anytime soon. I wouldn't trade my relationship for the world but I guess I don't feel ready to grow up yet even though i'm probably making twice as much effort than most of my friends. I like to think I don't feel that much different from a decade ago and i'm pretty certain they all do. 

I know all I can do is go with the flow and accept time for what is. But i'm worried in another 8 years I won't have the same relationship with my friends. Should I be making the effort to retain these friendships or should I just let time do it's thing? We all still have the same laughs today as we did 10 years ago but I feel like i've been getting overly caught up in nostalgia and it's been affecting my anxiety a lot as of late.",09Mar2020,1

109,"TLDR: Should I tell my parents about my self harm if I’m not in a position to stop it?

I have a history of self harm alongside multiple depressive periods, however the last time I acted upon these thoughts were nearly four and a half years ago, until last night. 

I’ve been struggling through some depressive episodes again and I have a lack of help at the moment (yes I’ve tried but I have to wait till May), but have this time opened up about my issues with my parents more. I feel strange telling them about half of my mood and feelings, but not about the thoughts of relapsing again, but I don’t know if it would do more harm than good if I told them while I’m not in a position to stop. 

I scratch so there’s nothing to take from me, and I can hide it well enough, it’s more about the guilt. They’ll probably end up finding out again, so I figured it would be easier to tell them now before I get too used to hiding it. But thinking about it, would this cause more problems if they know I’m self harming but can’t get help currently?

I don’t want to worry them persistently, but at the same time I don’t want them to find out months later and feel like I couldn’t trust them again (they are very accepting, but I stopped after I told them last time so have never actually experienced me self harming while knowing).

110,"Hello. Not sure where to begin so just going to go for it.

I'm 20, male (if that makes a difference).

Currently studying at uni in my second year. I passed first year and first semester this year without issue (avg a first)  and did well at school before uni. So by all accounts I'm doing well academically.

At home I have a tight group of friends and whilst I don't get to see them a lot due to uni I still talk to them through messenger etc. 

My uni friends are great, though I feel I connect with them a little less (home mates are all the same as me whereas here its much less the case). I also don't get to see them as much as I'd like to.

The above is just en explenation of my life situation which may/may not affect anything. I don't know. Ignore it if it's not helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

So now into why I'm making this post. Since I started High school I've been not in a great mental place, back then it was due to being bullied a lot and I sort of ignored my mental health becasue I had it down to that (and the fact the school didn't give a fuck) and so decided I'd live with it through school. Sixth form came and I really enjoyed it, for maybe the first time in years I was no longer *as* down. I still had issues with being down and so on but I had a good group of friends and actually felt accepted for once. 

Throughout school and college my biggest issue however hasn't been 'feeling down'. I *really* struggle with social situations. I have always been relatively quiet (Mum used to call me and my sister shy) but I don't know if it is that. My sister was always shy-er than me but flourishes in social situations when she's comfortable (think with friends etc), whereas I just sort of shut down no matter who it's with. I have way more confidence (if something needs doing I can get it done and sort of take the attitude of 'no one cares') but this only happens in specific times and places. When it comes to actually just having a conversation with people I shut down, like my brain freezes. Most people I know with things like social anxiety will have a panic attack but I just go mute both outwardly and inside. I'm struggling to descibe it well so if any clarification if needed I'm happy to try. 

Now at uni, especially with second year, I've had a lot more work and other comitments for me to take care of. This on top of the expected social peak that uni is meant/expected to be has left me sort of empty. I'm not socialising except with 1 coursemate and my housemates (even then only at lectures and at home). Everyone around me is going clubbing or even just meeting to go to the pub and I'm left feeling drained after having 1 conversation. I'm kind of lost with it all, I used to find these things no problem and now It's the same but just a lot worse. I'm also sleeping and eating way more than I used to (though I struggle to actually fall asleep) which could be an affect or just correlation (always liked sleep and food).

A few key things to note. I don't think I have depression. Why? Because I'm not sad. I'm not feeling down about my life per say, more just not enjoying it and finding it rather  bland. I also find my mind is blank/emotionless a lot of the time which, at least as far as I know, is not depression.  Could it be social anxiety (or something similar)? maybe. I'm not sure as it could well be shy-ness or just the fact I'm introverted. I'm picking on these two mental health problems as they seem the most common from my experience and \*could\* explain my issues, it could very well be nothing or something completely different however.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm writing this is not for a solution but for a second opinion. I'm not entirely convinced I should go seek help (also don't wish to clog the nhs especially with the corona virus stuff looming). Just if any of you have had similar experiences or anything really that may help then it would be greatly appreciated. I've been meaning to write this for a while and just sort of said fuck it now, there's a lot and it's kind of me spilling my brain into a post and I kind of don't know how to explain a lot of this as never spoken about it before so if it doesn't make sense or clarification is required then let me know and I will try my best.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Throughout life I've struglled socialising and think it could actually be a problem not just me being shit at socialising. Also think there might be more to it.

* Always struggled with social situations and talking to people
* Find myself being completely empty mentally (not thinking or emotionally experiencing things)
* feeling a bit down as of writing (hence the motivation to write this)",09Mar2020,1
111,"I'm in highschool. I'm a male. And keep in mind that I'm better now. Probably around last summer I got really depressed because of loneliness, a recent heartbreak and felt bad about my weight. I convinced myself that I was fat. I was 5'11 160lb, which I assume was a healthy weight but I felt bad about how I looked and felt I should starve myself as a way to seek attention and to hurt myself in a way. I was doing it in a strict way, as in I would eat one meal every 24 hours 4-5 days a week. Nobody noticed for about a month, and I had lost 24 pounds. So I kept going. I started going 24+ hours without food (I always kept track of my last meal). I was also talking to a girl at the time and we were 
talking far before. We were bestfriends but only because she had friend zoned the hell out of me. That was one of the reasons I did what I had done. -10 pounds(I'm not sure of the actual number) later and I think 1 or 2 weeks passed. The girl got a boyfriend, and admittedly, I got really jealous. I told her how I felt and she started gloating about her boyfriend and made me feel like shit. She was really toxic and for some reason I still liked her after that. I told my cousin, because I was too afraid to tell my parents of what I was doing. And she sorta talked me out of it. I was 6'1 126lb. I was at an unhealthy weight. Even if I didn't feel hungry I'd try force food down my throat. Sometimes I felt really hungry, while sometimes I wouldn't have an appetite at all. A few months later I was about 138lb, and I started talking to that girl's friend, and caught feelings. I was still friends with that bitch of a human being and she tried ruining my chances with the girl. She lost 2 close friends. I blocked her on social media and she tried saying sorry a few times but that didn't work. A few weeks pass and now we're dating. I'm 141lb, and still 6'1. I haven't been growing, but I'm still tall enough. Present day, and life's going good. My grades are going good, except science but I'm pushing through it. I take higher level classes (academic), and once in a while I work out. My girlfriend and I had our first kiss yesterday. I also met her parents. She knows what I have done and I consider her my bestfriend. That toxic girl is out of my life and she's jealous, I'm sure. She's still trying to ruin our relationship but my girlfriend isn't listening to her. She's not our problem. I've gone a while without starving myself. I thank my cousin for talking me out of it. I probably would've died of starvation one day if I didn't come out. I went from downhill to back at the top. She sat with me in the dark until the light came. Life's going good:).
Moral of the story: Don't give up. Don't damage your body, because you only live once, people care about you, and sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone.

115,"My situation is incredibly fucked up and I just want to recount it in a safe environment. Advice is always welcome, but this is mostly venting.

I have an anxious disorder. It's not exactly diagnosed yet, I'm waiting to see a psychiatrist. My GP (who doesn't believe in mental health issues) just told me I have a problem with anxiety and gave me a prescription. I've started therapy at a place that deals specifically with anxious disorders, and all these things have made managing my anxiety marginally better. I know my prescription isn't the ideal one, but I'll get the right meds once I see a psychiatrist, and for now, they're helping. But the real problem is, I'm the only one in my entourage to take my mental health issues seriously and treating them. Strap in, folks, 'cause this is a shitshow.

My boyfriend and I have 2 young children together, plus his eldest son who is 8 years old, let's call him Sans (he's a big undertale fan). Sans' mother has been a piece of work from day 1. I never liked her, and in the 5 years I've gotten to know her, I've made genuine efforts to get along with her, which has proven to be quite hard. You see, this woman (let's call her Satan) has always been teetering on the edge of sanity with one foot dangling over the edge. She has a rich family history of severe Bipolar schizophrenia. Everyone on her father's side of the family has developed severe symptoms of schizophrenia when they hit about 40. Well, she's 38 now, and shit just hit the fan. Satan's been developing symptoms of severe schizophrenia since this summer, and it just keeps getting worse. She started by talking with her dead brother, who was much older than her and died when she was quite young. He died in a car crash. Then her brother told her about the murder of one of Satan's childhood friend's mother (let's call her Lou). Lou died in the 90's while on a trip to the US, no one found her killer. The media had a field day with it. Just to make things clear, Lou and Satan were never close, by any means, but I digress. Satan's dead brother connected an otherworldly call, so to speak, so that Satan was now in direct contact with Lou. Lou told her all the gruesome details of her death in such a convincing way that Satan hauled her butt all the way to the police station to make a deposition. But this is just the beginning.

Since then, it appears that her brother is Schrodinger's ghost; he is in fact not dead, according to Satan, but locked up in an asylum somewhere because their parents need him alive to steal his identity. They still talk though. His spirit lives in a candle now. Despite being alive. Satan now believes her father tried to kill her over the holidays (which is completely false) and that her mother is attempting to steal her identity. We know her parents quite well, and she doesn't talk to them anymore, which is sad because they are genuinely nice people. And they miss their grandson. So we've taken it upon ourselves to have them over when my BF has custody of Sans because this little boy needs his grandparents in his life. Satan lets her dead brother drive the car because she's afraid everyone on the road is trying to run her over, and generally driving very dangerously with her children in the car. Satan has been breaking into her parents' homes and ransacking the whole place multiple times. Satan has been doing a lot of cocaine with her new boyfriend while leaving her other baby daddy at home to care for their youngest daughter of 2. Satan refuses to seek help. There are a lot of other alarming things Satan has been up to, but I swear I could write an entire novel. But here's the kicker; she has full custody of Sans, while my bf gets custody every other weekend, and half the time during holidays. We're worried sick every time he's at her place.

Satan refuses to see that she has a problem and refuses to seek treatment. Any time anyone mentions she needs help, she cuts them out of her life forever. We've been calling social services a lot to try and get her checked in to a mental facility, and so has practically everyone in her life. Social services are doing nothing. They tell us ""we can't do anything unless a drama happens"" which is the scariest fucking thing I've ever heard. We're speaking with child protection services every week and we're waiting for them to start the investigation, but there is a long waiting list, so it's been a while, even though they tell us that yes, this is 100% worrying and something has to be done. Now she won't even let my bf speak to his son on the phone when he's at her's and we are stressed the fuck out. There's no way to get news on how our little Sans is doing as no one we know has any contact with them anymore. 

Icing on the shit sundae is finding out, through a social worker overstepping her professional boundaries, that my bf has been diagnosed with BPD a year and a half ago. He didn't even remember because he was in such a state of shock when they took him to the psych ward. And no, he's never sought any treatment. He's afraid of pharmaceuticals, you see, and sees my pills as the devil because when I take a Klonopin, I take a nap, and that's really like abandoning him. Obviously, I've been dealing with his BPD for a while before finding out he had it, so it's not a deal breaker at all, I just have a neat little tag on it now so I don't take everything to heart, knowing some of his states are due to BPD. I found this out a few weeks ago after he had a major panic attack. The cops were involved, Satan was involved, it was a clusterfuck.

And now, having himself just found out he has BPD, my lovely grumpy bear has been doing a lot of research on the subject. And since he's read that people living with BPD need constant reassurance that he's loved and won't be abandoned, he takes that to mean that I should be constantly sweet and loving to him, even when he's pushing me away, even when he's damn near impossible to approach because of his shitty mood. I love this man to death, and I want to do that for him, but at this point I'm emotionally exhausted. There's too much going on and I just need a fucking break. Just trying to watch TV in the evening is a constant deep emotional discussion about how he needs to feel closer to me, how he's dealing with his sex life (and that part does get complicated, let me assure you) and I just can't deal with these conversations until 4am every damn night. He gets insulted when I tell him I need sleep, because of course, as a person with BPD  in a state of crisis, he doesn't get more than 3-4 hours of sleep a night and I should be fine with the same amount, right?

I'm trying to keep my cool, trying to keep everyone grounded, doing damage control every. Damn. Day.  I'm the person child protection services call, because I'm the one in the house with a level head. I'm the one the police talk to for the same reason. I just wish these two would seek fucking treatment. This has been going on for months and I just can't.

So I guess my therapy's going well? Living in this shitshow, it's hard to tell.

TL;DR: Stepson's mom is developing symptoms of severe schizophrenia and endangering her children while refusing treatment, my bf has BPD and is not seeking treatment, I have an unknown anxious disorder and really wish everyone would call their doc already.",09Mar2020,1
116,"It is a very weird title I know. But let me explain. 

I ruined my life because of choices I made which at first wasn't a horrible choice to me but it ruined my life because I couldn't see the negatives of it. I didn't see the dangers of those choices or anything scary. At this point, I'm in a horrible situation but I'm still not scared of anything although I know I messed up. Why am i so chill in the face of danger? I keep things to the last day and even if I don't have time to do it I don't feel afraid. 

But today I realized something, in my dream, i dream a lot about my current situation in life and it scares me so much...i wake up and for a while, i feel really bad because of it and then after a while when I'm fully awake and conscious, i don't feel anything about it. I'm like... it's normal.

122,"Hey Everyone,

**tl;dr – if you are like me, I want to arrange free online therapy for you (with a small catch).**

**About Me**

My name is Prakash. I’ve had depression since I was 12, ended up getting hospitalized for it and then spent significant time figuring out how to manage it with a therapist.

I've grown up in Hong Kong and spent significant time in New York. One thing I've noticed is that the cost of therapy the world over is quite high (either in terms of price or in terms of time taken to find a solid therapist).

Specifically, when I moved insurance providers in the states my therapist went from in network to out of network...and my co-pay went up from 20 dollars an hour to 80. I could not afford this and basically struggled alone for a couple of years, until I moved to India..where the cost of therapy was a LOT lower.

Existing providers like TalkSpace and Betterment are still quite expensive and I believe that expense is the biggest issue when it comes to finding a therapist.

**What I’m trying to do**

After having gone through the above, I wanted to work on getting more people access to mental health. As a result, I'm running this experiment to see if people can get value from teletherapy with a therapist sitting in India (because it's a lot cheaper over here).

So here’s what I’m proposing -

Go to this website [www.talkfreely.uk](https://www.talkfreely.uk/) and sign up.

I’ll reach out to you via email and schedule a weekly online session with a therapist.

For the first 5 weeks, this service will be free, after which it will cost you roughly 20 pounds per hour (or your equivalent local currency).

In return, you and I jump on a short call every week so you can help me iron out the operational kinks. I want to get feedback on what’s effective and what’s not, so that I can make the service better.

**Caveats**

If you’re facing really SERIOUS depression or another serious mental health disorder, DO NOT use this service. You need to get professional help in person. I'm also happy to talk to you in DMs (got a lot of experience dealing with the cage that is my mind).

If you’re in the US, you unfortunately **can’t use** this service because of regulation. If you’re in the UK, Singapore, HK, Dubai…you’re fine. The pricing is set in pounds, but I'm happy to convert to the currency of your choice.",09Mar2020,1
123,"She’s pissing me off. I really want this service. I want help. I want to grow as a person and I accidentally ended up in this program called mental health skill building because of a wrong phone call. I have a therapist and a case workerish person work together and the case workerish person is supposed to teach me life skills, monitor me, I guess be there to talk to???? I’m not really sure what’s she supposed to do, but I’m pretty positive she should be showing up on time more consistently. Like I know for a fact she’s been late several times by like a lot and we haven’t been doing this that long and today I’m not sure if she was supposed to show up at 9 or 10 so either way I was fine, but still she showed up at like 10:30 and that’s not the latest she’s been. We went to the grocery store after and I basically reverted to how I used to act because I don’t know how to deal with this. Like am I allowed to get mad? I’m so bad at expressing my feelings because my bio father and foster parents would get abusive if I did, but then I would act pissy and they would get abusive anyway like I don’t know how to say something. Also, she’s makes me self conscious because she doesn’t pay a lot of compliments like when I wrote a cover letter and got an interview she was like meh but she’ll agree when my apartment looks like garbage. I really need this service because my life is a fucking mess. I just acted so childish in a grocery store and I’m fucking 21 and hate myself.",09Mar2020,1
124,"New to this subreddit, so forgive me if I break a rule. Lately I have begun questioning reality. So much in my current experience seems increasingly unlikely. It came to my attention with news of COVID19, which I have been following somewhat obsessively since mid January. We are, apparently, in a pandemic of epic proportions. I live minutes from “ground zero”. Hand sanitizer and rubbing alcohol have disappeared from store shelves. The news is full of people in isolation and people who have died, whole countries in disaster mode, schools closing, events cancelled, and on and on. Yet, I rarely see anyone coughing or ill. No one I know is personally affected by the illness. If not for the media, I would not know anything is going on. Part of me wonders if it is all an elaborate hoax.  I suppose I have been primed for this perception because everything about our current POTUS and political news has felt unreal and downright impossible. Like a dream that I realize cannot be real, at which point I would typically awaken. But I must still be dreaming. The world seems to be falling appart, what with Climate change, escalating tensions and breakdown of relations between long time allies. Our government seemingly throwing out all semblance of decency and honor.

All this and more has me questioning reality, my mental health, everything.

Am I the only one experiencing this? 

What should I do?",09Mar2020,1
125,"Throw away, I have tried to reach out to friends for several days but everyone is busy with their own lives and I have nobody.

Last fall I lost my license for a driving infraction that I was total BS but it still happened (heavy rain, couldnt tell the road from the grass, it all just looked like water. Got stuck, walked home, police serve ticket for failure to control vehicle, lost license). Losing my license also caused me to lose my very well paying job which my employer had paid for me to go to school for and graduated last spring. A career I could one day retire from happily and loved the work. Losing my job in turn cost me my apartment and most of my dignity forcing me to move back in with the parents at 32 years old. This alone was enough to bring anyone down in the pit but I kept my head up, called an old employer that is only a 5 minute drive from my parents house and got my old job back. My father agreed he would take me to and from work as he is retired has the time. This has turned into something used against me in every fashion possible. Things started off ok as my parents were actually kind of happy to have me back around to help with the land, the house( they have a decent size property in the country) and I was more than happy to help. Things have progressively gotten worse to the point they have cut me off from the rest of my family, use the fact that I cant drive against me whenever they possibly can and tell me to leave their house almost every weekend because they know I can't drive and am way out in the middle of nowhere. 7 out of 10 times I cant even find an uber so I walk to town. After I have seen our traffic light and stopped at our gas station to get something to drink there isnt much left to do but stop down at one of our 2 restaurants and sit there ALL FUCKING DAY drinking coffee until my parents go to bed at night. Well this weekend my father pushed it even further and decided assaulting me in front of my mother was appropriate before they asked me to leave. He hit me down the stairs. I almost called the cops but knew this would only make things worse so I walked to town with my leg out of socket, cracked ribs and slept outside last night. I prayed to die, I prayed god would take me last night but he didn't. I had to call off work because I physically can't do my job in this condition its hard labor. I have tried to call a few friends just to talk and haven't had anyone pick up.  I don't even know how I'm supposed to feel or what to do, im lost.",09Mar2020,1
126,"Tbh I don't really know where else to post so I figured I would give this sub a shot. Basically I don't know if I am experiencing disassociation, depersonalization, derealization or something else. Since before year university, Ive been dealing with this (so around 5 years). Haven't gotten help but more recently have been looking into it and becoming contempt with the fact that I need to talk to someone. Before I went to university, I had an episode where I was high that made me freak out. Since then, everything hasn't felt the same. I looked at my parents and outlook on life differently. I think because of anxiety it has evolved to something else. I quit smoking weed almost instantly after this. I specifically have become hyper aware that life is in first person and that freaks me out a lot of the time. An example would be yesterday when I was driving, I looked onto a large city skyline and became aware of how open everything was and that I was experiencing it all in first person. I relate to somethings in disassociation but the thing is I'm a social person most of the time, and I always have been so I don't disassociate with people, more so reality, if that is even what it is. I don't know if this constitutes me as crazy or ""getting out of touch with reality"" but its just gotten to the point where I genuinely feel depressed that I don't have the same outlook on life anymore.

128,"Hey guys, 

My mental health has got to the point where I’ve finally decided I need to talk to someone. I went a few months back but bottled it and didn’t tell the Dr half of what was going on. Problem is I’ve just gone to book an appointment at my local GP and there’s a 20 day wait for an appointment. 

What I’d like to know is if I went into a walk in centre in the city would they be able to help? I can not control my anxiety and it’s starting to reflect in my personal and professional life. I’ve suffered from anxiety for many years but it’s finally at the stage where it’s overwhelming me.

129,"I was recently diagnosed with bipolar; it runs in my family. I've also been dignosed with ADHD, PTSD, major depression, and a polysubstance dependency. I suppose I'm looking for any comments or advice as I process this.

I started reading The Unquiet Mind to better understand the illness, and it has ease some of my anxieties. Though, I fear how it will effect my relationships and stability in life. Will I slowly lose my mind and become more unstable as my life progresses? Will I burden others with my illness and be deemed too much to handle? Will I be the bipolar mom that kids talk about? Will I be a fulfilling wife?

I'm petrified that the psychological strengthening Ive done over the 10+ years will start to whether away. Suicide weighed heavily on my mind as a child, and self harm was habitual. As an adult, regardless of how depressed I become, I can't fathom self harm and suicide is out of the question. The reckless behavior and neglect of self manifests in malnutrition, sleep deprivation, and other self destructive actions. I'm committed to my recovery though. I've been doing EMDR therapy for two years and started medicine to BP this week.

130,"You know... I can remember back before my brain turned into a scrambled egg, how hard I found it to believe that the ""crazy"" people managed to get to the point where they believed some of the stuff they spouted. 

Now, I realize that it isn't (usually) like just flipping a switch and going from ""Normal"" to ""The ants are eating my eyeballs"", but that it's so insidious that you only notice it in retrospect. Everything seems perfectly logical, perfectly rational- until, of course, you realise it isn't, that your behavior isn't normal, and ""holy shit, I need help before this gets any worse"". 

I've also come to realize that one of my biggest issues is that my brain can't agree with itself. The most annoying one of these by far is the fact that I know that the world is real, however I simultaneously  somehow don't believe it. I have this awful, gut wrenching fear that one day, I'm going to be walking or talking to someone and all of a sudden, someone is going to rip up the curtain and say ""Surprise! You actually killed yourself years ago, this is your own personal hell! Your kids don't exist, your family is wrecked, none of the last few years actually happened, and the entire world is a lie!"" It's like ""Wevebeenfuckingwithyou-o-phobia"". ""Just a Dream trope Syndrome"". 

I don't know how to rationalize this disconnect. It feels absolutely insane- but then everything around me still feels ""odd"". Out of place. Like it doesn't belong, it never belonged, and it's *wrong*. Like everything is slightly not right. It's just the strangest, most annoying feeling to be 90% sure you're dead, but still 100% sure you're alive. 

For the record, I am getting treatment and everything. I'm not a danger to myself and others. I just hate this. It is maddening to know ""This is how I used to be, this is how I got to tgis point"" but to have no idea how to get back.

132,"Ok, so to start off, no, I am not trying to  be some edgy teen who thinks they're some psychotic serial killer. 

Background info:
I'm  a fourteen year old male and my ex boyfriend is 16 years old (15 when we dated). We broke up on because we both agreed that we are in different times in our lives and  I began to grow insecure about our relationship. I just couldn't trust him because I always felt that he was cheating. We're still pretty good friends.

One thing that I've noticed is the increase of self harming activities, I've been doing it more and more with the thought of him in mind. I'll hurt myself and then hint at it to him in very vague details (ex. My thighs really hurt when I tried to take a bath). I've also had been having lots of intrusive thoughts and began to stalk him and this one girl (who've I've always thought of her wanting to get with him) on Instagram/other social medias. Although I don't think I can hurt anyone but I've been having thoughts, fantasies and dreams about either having him be with me  or brutally beating him/ him beating me and staying in a abusive relationship.

I'm 5'2 and physically weak so I highly doubt I can actually do anything to anybody. But otherwise this behavior has been taking a huge toll on my life. I've been isolating myself emotionally and it's consuming every day activities. 

This is more of a vent but I really want people's advice to end this kind of thought process. I just want to be friends with him because despite having a romantic attraction to him, I love having him as a friend.",09Mar2020,1
133,"Basically what it says in the title. Sometimes, in that weird place between falling asleep and waking up, I’ll be gazing into my room and suddenly see a human figure standing there, oftentimes someone I know but sometimes someone I don’t recognize. I’ll usually absentmindedly look at it for a few seconds before suddenly realizing I’m hallucinating, after which it dissapears immediately. These hallucinations are relatively uncommon (I think around once per month?) but I’ve had them for a while.

Another recurring hallucination I have is even weirder, because I can control it. When my room is dark and I’m in that transitory state between waking and dreaming, I can turn the wall next to my bed into a lush green jungle when it’s dark and I’m close enough, complete with animals, wind and everything. I can’t always make it happen, but I can always make it go away. 

Nome of these hallucinations are accompanied by any delusions or feelings of panic, and I am immediately able to snap out of them when I notice what’s happening, bring me back to a completely normal ‘awake’ state, albeit sometimes a bit rattled when I didn’t see it coming. A friend told me about hypnagogia, but I don’t think that’s what’s happening to me because the hallucinations described online seem to be a lot less detailed and lifelike than what I have.

I’m 18 now, and I started using drugs (including psychedelics) at 14/15, so perhaps this is some type of HPPD. The hallucinations don’t seem psychedelic at all, though, and I never really did much of the ‘serious’ psychedelics that are often correlated with HPPD. 

I’m not particularly concerned because these hallucinations aren’t affecting my life in any serious way, and I’ve always been able to distinguish between them and the real world. It’s definitely not normal, though, and I was wondering if anyone else on here has any experience with this kind of stuff.",09Mar2020,1

135,"Hello,
This is my first time posting on reddit so if I’ve done something wrong just let me know, but basically I have a brother who’s 23 and he acts as if everyone’s against him. He’s had a history of depression and he’s never been able to stick to one thing. He started at an Islamic bordering school and left, he started college again and then left, nearly every job except his last he started then left. His most recent job changed him. He started telling me how everyone at work was trying to “pattern” him. Pattern is slang for a lot of things, but in this context he is saying everyone is trying to help him get better. They will do things to teach him lessons, but they never told him that they were doing it. So he kept telling me about it and what he learnt and I was there to geo him figure out things they did and why. At first it was a good thing, it helped him a lot. He was getting better with his social anxiety, he wasn’t going in late and it seemed as though he was changing his life around. He was using some drugs to help himself think more which I didn’t agree with but nonetheless he told me he was going to stop once he had learnt and understood everything. Then one week he started acting really weird, getting high more and acting as if everyone around him knew something about him and were disgusted by it. Now he had told me what it was eventually and I was very understanding about it and tried to help, but I couldn’t. Then this one time he came home after work told us that he “failed the final pattern” the last thing to sort him out . He was acting deranged and stuff and I didn’t know what to think. He was telling us a lot of stuff that he had done which he thinks everyone knew about, how everyone in our city knows and he was scared. He started saying they are gonna kill us all and that he needs to go back to work or they’ll kill him. He started acting crazy. We, after a good, got him to calm down and leave. He promised us he’d stop his drug abuse and at first he was fine, but after a while he started acting strange. We thought he had moved onto more hardcore drugs and we were about to kick him out. We asked about it and he said yes he did do the drug in question and so we were gonna kick him out. After that he started denying it and after a drug test he was clean. I don’t know why he agreed, he doesn’t know why he agreed, but it makes no sense. He was fine for a little bit again, then after a couple weeks he started acting weird again. No personality, very cold. Randomly saying strange things and just being weird .

Today he came out his room and went to the lobby window saying stuff like “ I’ll batter them” this and that then went back to his room. Then I went in asked what’s up and he goes “ you know what’s up, why do you keep asking? They are watching me all the time.” I just left the room. I don’t know what to do anymore. We’ve tried taking him to a psychiatrist, but I don’t think he’s opening up at all. I genuinely don’t know what to do. I’ve always looked up to him and it breaks me seeing him like this . He use to trust me now he doesn’t even speak to me . I just want to know if anyone else has experienced anything like this before .

136," Today has been an awful day and I really need someone to vent to. Recently I moved school and have struggled to fit on or make any friends. i mind my own business and am constantly focused on my own work. Unlike at my previous school I’m genuinely well behaved and have changed my ways for the better. but last week I failed to hand in my homework so I gave it in a day later. For this reason, I was suspended from school today. I defended myself because I know this punishment is way harsh but the teachers did not listen to me. I don’t understand how missing lessons is going to benefit me especially with my exams round the corner. i thought if they dont want to listen to me, my mum will defend me. So I told her to call the school and stand up for me since they are not interested in anything I have to say. somehow she realised the fault lies in me and my lack of respect, and now she blames me. Well anyways once I was dismissed from school I had to go straight to the hospital to have a chat with my dads doctors. I later found out that my dad is dying and that completely crushed me. I miss how my dad used to be and now he’s just bed ridden unable to speak or recognise me. I just feel so damn alone. My dad is the only person who would argue with anyone to prove my innocence and if he wasn’t in hospital I know he would be in my school arguing with my teachers because he is never afraid to speak his mind. I miss him so damn much. i feel like I have nothing to live for. I feel so demotivated, like I am right now as im writing this paragraph.",09Mar2020,1

146,"I don't expect this to get any replies or anything like that, I just want to get this off my chest.

All the schools here have been closed for the past 3 weeks (might be longer, I lost count) due to the coronavirus outbreak in my area. At first I didn't mind because I needed some time to work on an assignment of 12 pages for English that's due to the 27th. But with one week remaining until I go back to school (unless another week is added) I was just sent a long list of tasks I have to do until next week. My mental health has actually been improving over the past few weeks or months, but when I read this list, I completely broke down. I feel completely overwhelmed. We were actually supposed to write exams these past few weeks, but now that the school's been closed, we've lost many lessons that would have prepared us for them. So when I go back to school, everything will hit me at once. I'm scared that I won't be able keep up. And the tasks they gave us don't help at all. Our school was closed after a week of holidays, so we weren't prepared for it and didn't pack any of our books. We can't study for the exams and now we have more materials that prevent us from working on our (very important) assignments that will make up a quarter of our grade.
My mental health gets worse when I'm at home and now that all the stress is hitting me at once, I feel even more drained. I considered not doing any of the tasks I've been assigned, but I don't want to risk my grades.
I feel even worse because the events I've been looking forward to might be cancelled due to coronavirus, like our class trip to Italy or the conventions I want to go to. Those kinds of things are what sort of keep me going. If I didn't have them, I'd just give up everything. 

Btw I live in Germany and there have been many recent cases of people being infected by the coronavirus in my area, so they closed all the schools and kindergartens to prevent the virus from spreading even more, which is kind of pointless because everyone else still has to go to work and could easily infect the people around them.",09Mar2020,1

Recently I had an idea on my quest of self-betterment - to look at the things that bother me as symptoms, not flaws. Something to diagnose and analyze and do combat with rather than sit here and say ""Well, that's just who I am and how things are meant to be.""

The first thing I did was Google what I'd like to work on first (title) but unfortunately all I could find were pages and articles about negative thoughts about yourself which isn't *quite* what I'm looking for. 

I say negative things out loud. A lot. Especially while playing games, and it really puts a damper on my favorite hobby. Does anyone else experience this? Every few minutes it's like *Oh that was bullshit* or *Wow that's TOTALLY fair* and so on, so forth.",09Mar2020,1

Every time she gets sad she gets the urge to drink normally she doesn’t but when she feels really bad and nobody is around she will but the urge is still there. We talked about it for a really long time and I told her thought she should go to AA or something but she doesn’t believe it’s a problem because she doesn’t drink a lot just when she’s sad because it helps her feel less sad.

Backstory:

I'm a teenage boy that was fine until I got to secondary school (High school) and then things started going down hill. I went into a deep depression, stopped eating and got really bad anxiety. But I was scared to tell anyone so I just bottled it all up and didn't show it. I hid it from everyone I knew. I started staying at home when everyone went out and when I had to go withing a couple of minutes I would have to find a bathroom. I would lock the door and cry and have a panic attack because of nothing. Just the reality of being in the outside world. My anxiety would continue to get worse and my depression would also continue to get worse. Skip a few months I had been in the hospital a couple of times because I wasn't eating. At this point people started noticing and soon I was taken to a doctor to get some help. I was put on medication for my anxiety and my depression and was going to a therapist for them. I had also been sent to a place to get better and start eating again. Then once I got outside of the rehabilitation place I went back to school and carried on having the panic attacks.

Now to the present. I have finally started getting better at calming down when in public and im having my panic attacks. I have also learnt to control my anxiety if that makes sense. I have also started to get better with my depression. I have learnt that to be living is a gift and that I should be gracious to be living. My therapists help witch I never thought she would and all together life isn't fully back to normal but its getting there. I know you all probably dont care but I just really wanted to tell someone. I'm happy again and I never thought that I would be.Never thought I would be able to belly laugh again with my friends but I can.

And if you are in the same position I just want you to know that you can get through it and everything will be okay. Just remember that there is someone out there that loves you. And that includes me and if you ever need to talk you can all ways DM me. And I was in a position where I wanted to jump and you just need to realize that it will hurt the people around you and even if you dont jump for you just dont jump for the others. I know that you may feel alone but your not. People care. And I do. I don't want people to go through what I went through so please I beg you if you start to feel anything like what I felt like or anything please get help because I promise you if you dont you will regret it.

I'm happier just to write this and share my experience and know I'm not alone and if you are reading this in bed feeling like crap or worse feeling nothing, you're not alone either.

But do you think I'm sort of rushing into this, because I really want help and this the best way to do it. But I don't think I'm going to be feeling better than I am now for a while so if I end up cancelling I'll probably feel really really bad. Should I go?",09Mar2020,1

163,"Hi! 

I just wanted to share my experience after last year I had a breakdown due to stress. I've been like you also looking for answers and some good news in this forum. Now I can share how I went through a mild medium anxiety not easy period of my life and I've survived and so far it has a successful ending.

 Last year I had a crisis after some months of too much stress, changing jobs twice because of a terrible line manager plus a period of forcing myself to fill my agenda with many activities and not listening to my body. I also had some difficulties to manage my emotions. I am from a different country and after four years living in London I was feeling low mood and a bit depressed. So tiredness +stress + being far from home and family is an explosive combo. My brain gave up and I felt as my whole word was falling apart and I couldn't put it together again and alone. So the GP gave me sertraline 50mg (Of course) without too much information and questions. I didn't hesitate and the second thing I did after the GP appointment was getting an appointment with a counsellor which helped me the most. Do it. Asking for help is key here.

I remember being incredible scared, with intrusive thoughts and thinking that I was getting mad and it would be like that for the rest of my life. Good news, it didn't! First 15 days felt terrible, sertraline increases anxiety symptoms and I remember having problems to sleep and feeling as if my heart was coming out of my chest, plus feeling depersonalization. The only advice here is PATIENCE, nobody dies of anxiety. It gets much better. I was worried about my libido and my orgasms took ages and they were weak but it got better after 6 weeks and then I didn't have more problems with that (50mg is not a high dose). 

I'd say that after 4 weeks I was already feeling much better and after 3 months I was totally recovered. I was 7 months in total and then started dropping off by half.First half I didn't feel any change.Then I started taking alternating days until I stopped. I remember feeling very angry and sensitive during this time. Once I stopped I was for four days without taking any pill but on the 5th I was feeling my anxiety symptoms back so I took half pill. It worked, maybe it was more a placebo effect but it calmed me down. I was like that until I could manage for more than 15 days and after that I just stopped. Also I had finished my therapy since the counsellor said I looked alright and I was able to put all my life together again and see things with more perspective. This period is difficult because you don't know if what you feel is because dropping off or what. Again, it is a matter of time. It is probably dropping off.

Today, after 5 months without sertraline I am completely normal and fine living my feeling in a normal way, there are phases that I feel alright and others that I feel bored or upset or something stress me... normal stuff. I have stress from life obviously but I've learnt to manage and listen to my body. I allow myself feeling how I feel in every moment. I think I can detect better the signals that something is causing me some anxiety so I stop and write it down. Writing is veery therapeutical. I also read the main chapters of the book ""Feeling Alright"" of David D. Burns and I try to apply the definitions of cognitive thinking and it works. It is not that I do it constantly but only when I feel that something is stealing my internal tranquility. In my case it is about taking a different perspective to things. It sounds easy but it is not but is not impossible neither. If you need help ask for it. It is the best advice I can give. Also I talked to everybody and told what I was going through and surprisingly I was not alone and not the only one. Unfortunately this is very common.

 So, that is my story and I hope it helps someone to feel a bit more faithful in the future which I know sounds impossible during these phases of life but it will get better soon. You will be sharing your story in not that long :)",09Mar2020,1

166,"Hello all! I have lurked here for quite a bit and this is my first time posting in this sub.

I wanted to restate that I'm not sure that this is the place for this kind of question; but I can't think of a better one.

When I was a child I had a LOT of anxiety around my parents being imposters. This was especially true when they picked me up from school or day care. I would interrogate them pretty much every day after not having seen them to make sure they weren't imposters. I don't know when or what caused this to start and stop, but it has not been an issue for as long as my memory serves to be continuous. My mom has made a few jokes about it over the years but I haven't really asked her about it. 

I recently learned what [Capgras delusion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capgras_delusion) is and it immediately brought me back to those times, I even felt the waves of anxiety that used to accompany the horror of ""realizing"" my mom/dad was an imposter. I looked into it and there aren't treatments and this is normally a disease reserved for those experiencing dementia, so is my case of temporary childhood delusions unique or uncommon? Is this a common thing in children? I always thought it was a kind of phase kids went through.",09Mar2020,1

I have been to a few sessions of talk therapy last year - it was set up through the company I worked for  in a very rural area, so the therapist I met was the only option. I would like to continue to address childhood sexual abuse, along with potential symptoms of anxiety / depression. For example, taking over two hours to drive home 15 minutes from work because I couldn't make a left turn. 

My sister has been diagnosed with anxiety and is medicated if that matters. I know I'd have to see a psychiatrist if I wanted to try to get on medication, but I don't know that I do, as well as I'm not sure if that's something you need a referral for.

These thoughts quickly becoming overwelming and induce anxiety, panic and dread. For some reason it feels like I was never existing up until now or I stopped existing for a short period of time.
These shorts episodes tend to occur when I'm doing something I don't want to put my full attention into like school work or any type of mundane work.
As well as these symptoms of anxiety, I also have the feeling like nothing is real or everything feels dream like.

170,"So today I found out some bad news. Now, other people in my situation would react in a negative way if they heard the same news. They would be sad, and possibly angry. Something that they would be looking forward a lot to might not be happening anymore. However when I heard, I didn’t and still don’t feel anything. I’m aware that it might not be happening. I’m not in denial. I just, don’t feel anything. There’s no happiness. No anger, no sadness. (I don’t want to go into specifics for this one)

Now, this happened to me a while ago too. Months actually. I was informed that a family member had passed. Yet I didn’t feel anything. If I remember correctly, I didn’t cry once. I knew it happened. Again no denial. No sadness, anger, or anything. Sounds harsh considering it’s family. It was someone I was pretty close to when I was young. I remember that we had good times. So you’d think I’d be upset. However that was not the case. 

I know these two events are pretty far apart, but I just wonder if it is concerning. I mean, like 2 months before the first event happened with my family member passing, I slowly started falling into a bad mental state. It kicked in fully about 2-3 months after it happened. I don’t think the event was connected to my mental state that much. But I don’t know.

Basically by “bad mental state” I mean that I isolated myself, stopped caring about everything, let my grades slip, stop being involved in things I would normally be interested in, and wished I could just disappear. I thought I had recovered, though I received no professional help (that’s another story). One weekend it felt like I snapped back to normal. Just like that. Maybe that wasn’t a full recovery. 

Anyway, should I be concerned?",09Mar2020,1
171,"Over the past month or so I've been experiencing weird issues with my mental health. 

Sometimes it feels as though I'm not really fully present. It's like I'm there but there's just some layer in between me and reality.

I often don't feel like other people including myself are any more significant than any other inanimate object. This doesn't change my behaviour but it just makes everything seem surreal.

I frequently feel like I'm going insane and it's like I  don't trust myself.

I often find myself feeling like everything meaningful to me is somehow stupid or like I'm just living a delusion.

In the morning I can find it incredibly hard to focus on a task and I'm usually very anxious about things.

Sometimes I feel like I can't stop thinking and it gets overwhelming.

I find I'm frequently very emotionally sensitive, to the point that some emotions can be overwhelming.

I occasionally feel as though some colours stand out or are more vibrant than usual. I also sometimes become very sensitive to sounds, especially unpleasant ones.

I'm currently living in some stressful circumstances which I think are likely to be the cause, but I'm worried that something more serious might have come out of it.",09Mar2020,1

174,I’ve never really had a huge problem with food except for rarely feeling hungry but lately I’ve been afraid of eating. It stresses me out so much. I don’t feel like I ever know what’s in the food I eat. I’m 15 so I live with my parents and my mom usually does the cooking. I always have to watch her cook to see if she puts anything weird or suspicious in my food. I don't eat out anymore. I never eat or drink things I’m being served that has been brought to me from a different room. When I eat dinner with my family I’ll eat as little as possible. I skip most meals and I throw away the food when no one is looking. I don't feel like eating is safe. Even the foods I prepare for myself don't seem safe to eat.,09Mar2020,1

 I want to say, I am not looking for a diagnosis, but rather curious if somebody else feels this way and if they treated this condition n any way, shape or form.

 For the purpose of this post let's assume that my name is Ian.

Now this is a weird one, but bear with me. Quite oftenly it feels like I have several layers or masks. There is a me, and then there is, well, Ian.

So when my actual self doesn't know what to do (what it wants), it just does what Ian would do. These kinds of decisions do not feel natural, nor do they make me feel fulfilled.

180,"I'm not sure if i put this on the right subreddit,it's my first time using reddit.

For the past few months I've been really jumpy and scared. Example, a few minutes ago i was going to get some water when i saw my mother,pretty normal, but a few seconds passed and i just jumped from fear(?),shaking mid air and hitting my head against the door frame. It felt like a shock wave went through my body just because i saw my mother. I have no idea why this is happening, it doesn't seem normal to me since it just recently started and I'm not scared easily,example i play games with disturbing imagery and such. There was another moment that i remember when i was lying on my bed and my dad wanted to tell me something and i just jumped into a sitting position and stared at him like a traumatized kitten. Note: this happens seconds after i see the said person. 

Oh another thing, I'm experiencing a lot of déjà vus lately, and they hurt. Can i call them déjà vu? I dont know. I keep experiencing situations where im just sitting there shaking and thinking ""this already happened, why am i reliving this again?"" in completely random situations. I have no memories of the things happening,i just have this weird gut feeling where i think im reliving the moment. Sometimes my head starts to hurt,sometimes i get annoyed by everything, or i just catch myself thinking why. It just hurts my brain thinking about it.

Any answers about why or how this happens would be appreciated. Thanks.",09Mar2020,1

183,"Was wondering if I could grab some thoughts, perspectives and opinions on the matter. I have a very good friend and I’m concerned for their mental well-being so to speak. Though I try to keep an open mind and I try to stay positive – it’s getting a little harder and harder to connect with some of the things that are shared with me.

Its important to know they are struggling with these beliefs and trying to make sense of the information that is seemingly pouring in from somewhere else rather than creating it if that makes any sense at all. They seem groomed in a sense though from what I know of their lives its unlikely. 

They mention that they see crystalized things all the time (and by all the time I mean daily) – they see things moving along the walls all the time, they’re saying that sometimes they “blip” out…. They blip out into another dimension – and that’s why they forget things when they “blip” back. 

While driving they have said they see people walking they know aren't from this planet, often having grotesque faces too scary to try to look at. While walking through a crowd they can tell who isn't from this planet as well as knowing what species they are. They’re able to communicate with other dimensions – though they can’t control when to open or close a channel – they’re still able to see the people who have past and sometimes even communicate with them.

They believe they’re not from earth and that they’re just passing by to another place but have to go through their human life on earth. They have a job to do on earth and when it’s time to leave they leave to another place.  They’ve struggled for years with physical health issues –  relying on Eastern health and often taking some very scammy fix all products, some even claiming to autism. A fool and their money, I know. 

 For some scope this is a high functioning intelligent person who has only recently decided to open up about these things and knows full well that if she tells people they won't understand, and that's acceptable. Their focus is deffinitly changing from their organized religious beliefs to Aliens and visions and numerology and they're struggling in general though understandable given their beliefs of what is real. I'm sure there is more than I know as well, this is me trying to write it in a very generalized way to paint a picture.

I've read the faq, I'm pretty sure i know where this will go, I just want some of that sweet confirmation bias I guess. I want them to be better, but they feel that this path is the ""I'll get better once I understand more"" path so I feel like it will be hard for me to push for therapy when they feel they're on the path to better mental health.",09Mar2020,1

185,"Partially need to vent, partially need advice/suggestions.

I have been going through a lot lately, including a bad relapse of my eating disorder, plus finding out that my dad and Grandpa are both dying (I'd be surprised if either of them makes it another 6mo). I have really been struggling and know I need to address it before it gets worse. I've done therapy before and it was mostly helpful.

Today I called to set up an intake for individual therapy. They said my paperwork probably won't get passed on until next week since it's spring break. Once my paperwork is passed on, the clinical director has to review it, assign me to a therapist and then the therapist has to call me to schedule my first appointment, which could take another week. I went with them because they (supposedly) have therapists trained in eating disorders and they offer a sliding scale. There are two other providers locally that have ED therapists but I can't afford either of them until I've met my nearly $3k deductible.

I'm starting to think about just calling and cancelling. I'm not in crisis or anything but I was really wanting to get this process started before I chickened out. The last place I went to, I was able to do a walk-in appointment and then I was on the schedule with a therapist the next week, I didn't have to wait 2-3 weeks. I could go back there but I don't think they have anyone that specializes in EDs.

187,"I'm bipolar since I am 10. I firstly got diagnosed by my psychiatrist mom, she's type II, it runs on her side of the family so it wasn't such a surprise. Since then, doctors only told or I wasn't sick and just a brat teen, or that yes indeed it's bipolar. No doctor ever listened to me before giving me a wanted diagnosis. I always knew.

It's a luck. I've never been in that medical wandering. But I grew up with it and I got so good at hiding and faking now when I tell someone they always answer they couldn't tell. I went from crying in foetal position to be able to keep a conversation and faking smile while having a heavy panick attack. That guy I'm seeing told me being surprised because I look so normal and he had no idea bipolar disorder can even get really stabilised. Well I could tell he has autism within two days haha.

But I'm stable just because I'm on heavy medication. I'm taking lithium, lamotrigine and pregabaline. I stopped saying that I don't take that much meds when a friend came with me to the pharmacy and they gave me seven boxes. I was like yeah, no, it's just that I am trying Xanax for a couple weeks because of the extra stress. Still, a lot of boxes. 

It wrecked a good chunk of my life. I got my high school diploma at 21, failed two first year at uni. But still. I'm getting back in September.

I'm giving my notice tomorrow and will soon have to find a new psychiatrist. I love the one I see now. I don't want to leave her. She's the first ever who stan my mom for giving me lamotrigine at 10 because no one would have done it, even if it wasn't really ethical. 

What if the next person I see find me too stable, too normal to agree to give me my meds? What if people stop taking me seriously? What if stop believing that I'm mentally ill too? Only proof that will remain is the shoes box full of medication and the kinder surprise plastic eggs I use to put meds doses in my bag.",09Mar2020,1
189,"I'm a 19-year-old college freshman, female. I consider myself to be a pretty smart kid, my first semester I had straight A's at the cost of my mental health deteriorating. After my first semester ended, I tried taking a break for my winter break but my anxiety kept rushing through me and I felt like I was being lazy. I decided to not go home for most of the break so that I can work and earn some extra cash. My boyfriend left about a week in to go home and I was so scared to be alone that I paid for my mom's plane ticket to keep me company but it proved to be a terrible idea because she ended up taking most of my money and making me pay for a hotel because she didn't like my dorm since she couldn't smoke there. Overall, the break was really stressful and I ended up coming home for about a week and it was actually quite nice to see my friends from high school even if I only have 2 of them. 

I suffer from PTSD from childhood neglect and physical abuse that continued from when I was a baby to when I was about 13 and ran away from home. I have a really difficult time making friends because, as my therapist described it, it became a coping mechanism for me to stay safe as a kid. Now I don't know how to make friends and whenever I try, new people annoy the shit out of me. I thought I had formed a bond with my two roommates, but they became closer to each other than me and never invite me to anything unless they need a ride or drugs. They also almost never clean our dorm so I basically moved out because I got sick of being the only one that cleans. (I came back today to get something and the sink was clogged halfway up with water with dirty dishes growing mold on them to the side) I have formed an unhealthy dependency on my boyfriend. Every time he's away from me I get extremely depressed and unmotivated. But when I am with him I'm so comfortable that I can't get anything done. My grades have fallen a lot since last semester and I can't focus on anything. I also have pretty bad ADHD so doing any school work takes twice the effort for me and I feel like I burned myself out last semester. I don't want to do anything and whenever I try to, my brain just won't absorb it and I'll zone off for like 20 min without noticing. I'm a pre-med student and I can't afford this. It's stressing me out even more because becoming a psychiatrist is all I've been passionate about since I was a child. It has been the light at the end of the tunnel for me and now I'm barely getting through acting class for my humanities. I don't know what to do. I feel so useless.",09Mar2020,1

I didn’t even tell her that my mom hit me constantly, grabbed me, dragged me around, made me beg for her not to hurt me even more. She also molested me and made inappropriate sexual remarks about me when I was as young as 6. My mother was super emotionally abusive and as a result I’ve been suicidal since I was 7 years old. At the time I didn’t understand why I was so depressed and suicidal, but when the memories came flooding back it made sense.

192,"It's like I can see the rest of my life split into different sections of a four-panel window. 

I'm afraid if I wait too long, the soot and grime of procrastination will leave the glass blurry, a reminder of my failed hopes and dreams.

One panel, a stained violet. It brings forth a cleansing order, a laid out path for my eyes to wander about. This light will grow stale, it was never my brightness to begin with. For many nights I wondered if it could work. Perplexed by the thought, I let it dwell. It seems as though I am too far on this path to turn. Everything is this shade now, it's been years since my lenses have tasted another flavour. Long have I missed the days where I could loiter by that window, wondering which way the sun will take me.

Give me the blue light I wish I had pursued. Give me the wife, the kid and the dog. Give me the job I never knew I wanted. Give me meaning. Give me purpose. Give me something that I can look back on. Give me the feeling of an ocean, swallowed by the countless joyous memories of which I will never indulge. I'm left alone with these desires yet no substance remains within me. Hopes vast as the ocean, with effort shallow as the plastic swimming pool in the middle of our backyard.

Take the red light. Take the boredom. Take the unwillingness. Take my sociopathy. Take what they wanted me to be. Take I've lost all semblance of what this ""me"" was. A collective of dead dreams were unloaded on my brain since my arrival. Sending out messages to have these thoughts cleared out. Reveal a path to my subconscious. Reveal the green.

Bring back the green. Bring back creation. Bring back life. Bring back worth. Bring back the things that made everything glow. I once looked out the four panel window and saw my friends, walking home from school with a soccer ball and some spare smiles. Snowbanks now fill the curbsides. Grimey, and filled with the same soot that's building on my window. As the snow begins to melt, I spot a fleeting green. The colour so bright it speaks.

""There's a way out. It's a long road filled with shattered glass and red coals. You'll be different by the end, but if you take my hand we can make it out together.""

The voice fades.

The sun goes down.

I guess I'll try again tomorrow.",09Mar2020,1

Background- I have had depression for 4 years. Some was bullying but not even half, My mind would be scattered(i have ADHD and  Dyslexia). My mind deeply thought about how meaningless life is. But now im fine after 4 years of struggle but now have a new problem.

1st sign Noises- First off i started to hear like distant voices,footsteps, knocking, and esc... But not close but far, also not just in one place everywhere like school,my house, and many normal places that these sounds would not be. Like just last night i was in my room and i hear voices in the distant saying rubbish words that have no meaning.

2nd sign My mind- i will believe anything in my mind. Example i was home alone and then my mind said theres a homeless guy in your house protect yourself, i get knifes and lock myself in my room. I hear his footsteps so i run out and nothing. I hear foosteps around me so i turn around and see nothing but still hear footsteps right next to me. 

3rd sign Hallucinations- I will see weird things in my wall including falling smiles, tv static in my walls, and sometimes my whole room will do a 360 with me inside and i can feel it. all sober. While sitting on my chair i will see objects move a couple feet and then stop.
