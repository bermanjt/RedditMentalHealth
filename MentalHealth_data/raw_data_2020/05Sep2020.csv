Any advice? Thank you :))",05Sep2020,1
1,"So, I've struggled with severe insomnia my whole life, which has several symptoms that are similar to schizophrenia after prolonged sleep deprivation, and then ended up with ptsd when I was 20. Luckily, I got that diagnosed and have done therapy and found ways to mitigate the negative effects of these issues. Slowly but surely, always moving forward. I'm 29 now. 

I've realized that while those issues would have and will always influence my life, who I am, and how I respond to life, I've realized that my circumstances and situation have kept me from becoming myself and figuring out what brings me joy in general. My mental health problems sort of compounded and I have spent most of my adult life homeless, begging for meals, literally living outside and off of handouts when I couldn't couch surf. I became an alcoholic because there's nothing like it to get you to sleep while you're freezing in a train yard, ya know. 

Well, about a year and a half ago, a couple of my long time friends offered to let me live in their spare room in a better town than my hometown. Since then, I've finished the bachelor's degree I had to abandon back after the traumatic event, get and keep a couple of jobs, and figure out what I want out of life. 

Turns out I love metal working and working with machinery and cars. I'm sure I would have always loved these things, but I never got the chance to even own a car for more than a couple of weeks. I've found my passions and they happen to be things I've just never had the opportunity to even experience. I'm working to learn to weld and have been working on cars and trucks for the last several months and I've never felt happier and more fulfilled with my daily life. 

And I never had the chance to even know that this brought me happiness, because I didn't have access to it. 

If I hadn't grown up poor, in a dead little town, maybe I would have found out and been able to work toward it before getting ptsd, but we can never know. Maybe if someone had offered me a safe place to exist earlier, I could have gotten a job and a car and learned back then. But that didn't happen. 

It's made me realize in a very real and significant way that as people say, our environment really does influence who we are. 

So I wanted to say if you feel like you have no purpose or if nothing brings you joy, or if you don't know what you want to do, or you don't have any skills, it's not too late. I didn't get the chance to even find something I loved till I was almost 30 years old.

Felt like that might be worth sharing. Seems like it might help someone. 

I'm open for questions and whatever too.",05Sep2020,1

6,"Hello everyone,   


I hope you are doing as well as you can in the current climate. I just needed to vent somewhere but also feel like there is somebody that cares at least a bit cause I really need some company just now. Corona hit hard and I had issues all throughout it but recently I came back from my home country to the place where I live. I knew that things would get tough again as I assumed my anxiety levels would increase due to university getting closer, coronavirus getting stronger, trying to figure out my future etc.  


I was not able to get in touch with my psychiatrist since April, I was supposed to have an appointment back then but it got cancelled and then I have never heard from them. I was still waiting for the call as I was just supposed to enrol into therapy. The call never came. So I finally called my GP and found out that this was the second psychiatrist within two years that left the hospital and therefore I will start from point 0.   


I have been having some darker thoughts in the past week as lots of things went wrong. I had issue when moving and some other things. Currently I feel overwhelmed and lonely and I just really wish I could have someone that would sit with me here and that would drink tea with me. The thing is though I ultimately also usually run away from people as they sometimes make my mood and situation worst.  


I don't know. I just really really really need a good hug.",05Sep2020,1
7,"My mother called me today and informed me that an ex boyfriend of mine was just arrested for first degree murder. I don’t know how to feel. I feel sick. I feel sad. I don’t feel safe. He was always a little...different. He wasn’t violent at first. When he turned violent is when I left him. I tried warning the next girl about it. But she didn’t believe me until he did it to her too. She pressed charges against him and got away. I tried being his friend for a while hoping that he’d go to therapy and get help for his anger. I don’t know the details of his charges, what really happened, other than it’s first degree murder. Are these feelings I’m having valid? I just don’t know how to process this.",05Sep2020,1

9,"I never been someone who would suffer anxiety
But lately I been feeling anxiety and feeling stressed
Over simple an Daily stuff mostly about online school my school doesn't really do zoom or anything like that they mostly send stuff and chores for us to do 
The thing is that because of this even when I have done most of my work I still feel stressed and feel like I should be doing something today I had to re do something I spent a few hours in and ended up criying I feel bad for crying about something so simple and so dumb but I just been feeling so bad this year I don't even know how to talk about this to my family their approach is more saying that I should just do everything I have to but even when I do I can't seem to feel peace is just not that simple is getting harder to do my jobs just because of my emotions at the moment and it hurts me even more the fact that I can't stop thinking that all of this is dumb and i'am just making to much of a problem over something so simple",05Sep2020,1
10,"I've only ever had one GF, and she dumped me 6 months ago and it made me feel like shit. To this day, I have no idea why she did so. I've always been good to her and I tried my best to make her happy. In the end, she treated me like shit when she wanted to leave and made me feel like everything was my fault. Heck, I was the ultimate simp for her. I've lost so much money and I stressed out too much for her and because of her during the relationship. After she left, I became extremely depressed but I managed to pull myself out of it after like 4 weeks of misery. Then came a period of a couple months of happiness. 

After that honeymoon period ended, I've been up and down, having some relapsing moments and other times hating her will all my soul moments. I've tried to move on, but it's like she emotionally scarred me. 

Right now, I really yearn for intimacy. Not in the sexual way, but in a way that makes me feel safe and happy. You know? Like someone to talk to or even hug. However, I dread the process of asking someone out and starting the whole process all over again. At this point, I'm too numb to even like someone. I'm too numb to even give 2 shits about anyone. Believe me, I try to like people but I'd rather not spend time with anyone nor see anyone.

I don't like the feeling of being alone. I am over the person who treated me like shit, but I'm not over how I was treated nor am I over how things happened.",05Sep2020,1

14,"One of my favorite quotes in literature comes from John Milton’s Paradise Lost. Upon being cast from heaven, Lucifer rallies his despondent followers, invigorating them with a thrilling speech proclaiming that, “The mind is it’s own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.” Despite coming from the Prince of Darkness, this quote is one used to inspire optimism. In many ways, it holds a great deal of truth, but misses out on one important detail: minds, like places varying by location, vary by individuals, and some cannot make a hell into heaven alone.

A truly awful symptom of mental illness is the fact that it’s often dismissed. Human society is dominated by customs and ideals, dictations on what is acceptable, and what is not. This has the significant role of maintaining order within society. It’s useful in preventing reprehensible such as rape, murder, wanton theft, and so many other social anathema. Those who follow society’s cultural laws are often rewarded, but those who act out of turn may become pariah. Unfortunately, this is where the great failing of many customs comes into play. For reasons they cannot control, many find themselves before the judge of society, not as perpetrators, but as unwilling victims.

A common, and far too misunderstood illness is ADHD, a disease I am intimately familiar with. In my opinion, one of the most harmful false equivalences in the world of mental illness that ADHD is stupidity. Execution dysfunction (and if you don’t know what that is, imagine your own mind is a cage that your trapped inside of) was the cause of extremely harmful social stigma directed towards me. My ADHD manifested in odd behaviors that often attracted the ire of those around me. I remember one day hearing classmates of mine refer to me as, “stupid and crazy.” I once had a teacher tell me that I would become a criminal someday and end up in jail. I was told by another teacher that my brain was broken. All of which severely harmed my self esteem, but one of ADHD’s most insidious symptoms made this blow to my self esteem so much worse.

Individuals who have ADHD have a nervous system that is wired in a manner that is different from what you might consider, “the average person.” We experience something of a stimulus overload that can magnify feelings of pain. This pain isn’t just limited to the physical, it also envelopes psychological pain as well. 

Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria is said to be one of the hardest, if not the hardest part of having ADHD. Rejection hurts us all and that pain is always a valid feeling to go through, but for those with ADHD it is like that pain is magnified ten fold. I remember times when I found myself on the floor, unable to move, feeling as if white hot metal was piercing my back because of what someone had said to me earlier that day. I developed an obsession with intelligence and not appearing mentally ill. In turn, resulting in my unwillingness to seek treatment, in turn only worsening my experience. Yet at the same time, everyone else assumed I was just acting that way, as if I had full control over it. I now know that that was not the case at all, yet I still believed that it was my fault. Though every day I wish someone would just choose to understand me, I wish they would give me the benefit of the doubt instead of treating me as if I was either a menace or irreparably stupid. 

When faced with people who seem like not all the lights are on upstairs, acting in disruptive manners and/or are generally a nuisance it’s easy to simply disregard them as “choosing” to do so. This is understandable, because as self aware as we all are, we sometimes tend to forget to be “other aware.” We often don’t realize that consciousness, pain and emotion are experienced differently for each person, but they are, and that is the most important thing that one can understand.

I don’t have OCD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, dissociative personality disorder, mental retardation, psychosis, paranoia or many of the myriad of ways that one’s brain can be made different. I can’t imagine what it’s like to suffer from many of those, but I do know what it was like to be stereotyped and dismissed. I wasted *years* of my life, missing out on opportunities and experiences because I had a disease I didn’t even understand, but because no one was willing to understand me I suffered, and no one should have to go through pain like that. The mark of failure is not poverty and illness, and the mark of greatness is not simply prosperity and health, but if there is a true indicator of a person’s worth, it lays within their compassion. 

The strong and privileged have been given a great gift: the opportunity to lift up the weak and disadvantaged, but so often is it wasted by ignoring and pushing those below them down, and there is no greater waste of a gift. So be the caring person in someone else’s life. Help those who cannot help themselves, be a source of inspiration rather than envy, show compassion to those even who struggle with expressing kindness. The difference between compassion and cruelty is the difference between Heaven and Hell, and it is better to serve for Heaven, than to rule in Hell.",05Sep2020,1

17,"Im underweight and my family and my so called best friends let me know about it, my parents (my dad especially) talks about it everytime I try talk to them about anything. The problem is, it's physically impossible for me to gain weight, I have a high metabolism so my body burns through food quickly. My friends and family remind me of it too much, they make rude nicknames about my weight. As well as this, I feel like I have social anxiety (I don't know if I do but I do feel like I do), everytime i'm in public, I cant go anywhere without feeling like someone is watching me and i'm being judged. School is restarting for me in a couple of weeks and it's tearing me up inside. I have a lot of 'friends' which has and still does make fun out of me for everything i'm insecure about, including my weight. I don't want to ditch my 'friends' though, because I have known them since i was very young. I only have 2 friends which I trust to talk to. 
I'm insecure about my weight (underweight)

18,"Hello, i'm a teen and i'm just gonna vent how i feel. I'm starting to feel like it really needs to get out and if people want to give suggestions to why i feel like this, you're welcome to do that.

Whats the point in life? Everyday I wake up, get dressed, eat breakfast and brush teeth just to go to school and learn 6 and a half hour's worth of material, just to go home and sleep. Rinse and repeat. And during that day i don't feel genuinely happy at all, i can put it on for my 'friends', parents and teachers but inside i'm hating it.

I hate waking up because it means another day. I hate sitting in class, trying my best to learn but nothing goes in. I hate going home because in my head i have nothing to distract myself with and end up telling myself 'why didn't you learn anything today?' I hate going to sleep because i know i have to wake up the next day and repeat the cycle all over again.

I keep telling myself that i need to work hard and study so i can get a good job later on. But for what? So i can be a miserable adult instead? Will getting a good job make me happy? I'm doubtful.

 None of the people i know are anxious, sad or annoyed all the time. They just move on past every day, seeing it as a new day, but i can't see it like that. It's just one long cycle for me. They have their goals in front of them and they have no fears that they will fail. Any minor goal i have is shrouded in anxiety, i'm gonna fail either out of something i will do or something i've already done to ruin my chances like being rude to someone.

I went from a great student to someone who loathes studying for school. I went from someone who used to be just a little worrisome to a full blown anxious mess. I went from being happy with life to not enjoying a single aspect of it.

20,"The moment I dreaded has come. I talked to my therapist about my disassociation, brain fog, dysphoria and depression.

While I was telling her she started crying and telling me that she thought she wasn’t helping, that she felt impotent to do anything, that I needed to open up... and I just smiled and assured her it was not her fault. She kept crying as mine just disappeared.

Now, this has happened to me with friends that have tried to help me and how it usually goes is I slowly mask, start getting even more numb and ghost em (one of the reasons I’m in therapy) 

The other option is actually making a change and trying to improve to avoid hurting others but I just can’t do that because I’m addicted to doing all my bullshit which is perhaps sth that should be addressed.

21,"I've been feeling ways I've never felt before. Like for the past 6th months I've had this building psychosis, but absolutely snapped today.

Constantly asking if he's safe, believing he now has venomous semen etc. This manic episode lasted for a few hours, and while I feel more relaxed and collected now, there's still a fear in my head.

Also at my job I have to wear a headset with a computer voice in it. Last time I was at work I was hearing the voice now in my head, telling me I'm evil.

22,"No matter how many upvotes I get, I’m still the same useless excuse for a human being. 
I go to work, we’re busy, I do work well for a few hours, have a panic attack, and then I make my best (extremely shitty) attempt to talk to people who seem nice to me at work. You know why they talk to me? Cause they have to. Like everyone who has ever met me, and still talks to me. They interact with me because of pure obligation, and in reality couldn’t give a shit if I died.

I’ve known this for years, but it still messes me up: knowing that every interaction I have with anyone is forced, and that they’d 100% rather talk to anyone else, and they ignore me when it’s convenient. 

Anyway, if there is someone you know has pretty bad anxiety, and they are very quiet, please, please, please, don’t just let them “do their thing”. Make an effort to talk to them. If they don’t respond immediately, fine. Just, please: if they talk, please further the conversation.

My most recent diagnoses is severe ADHD with CPTSD, my most prominent symptoms have always been hypomania and massive depression so the misdiagnoses make sense.

My biggest problem in life has always been communicating how I really feel, and not masking for the benefit (or detriment) to myself and others. Recently my spiral in mental health and general outlook has just pushed everyone away I care about and has left me in a position where I know what i’ve done wrong and i know how my actions have hurt others, but the only thing that consumes me is the loneliness and depression. i know that the people in my life struggle with knowing what to say to me but I don’t know what to do anymore, i’m in therapy I have new anti depressants and a new lisdex dosage coming but i’m still stuck in the ‘everything is pointless, everyone hates you, you shouldn’t be here’ spiral, I feel like the only people I have to turn to are my family but they’re a big source of a lot of my problems, which is why I leaned on friends so much I guess, but now i don’t have that i’m left with the lesser of too evils.

She asked me, ""Will you be my friend? You're my only friend."" 

I opened my eyes after she asked me, like I said, I wasn't asleep just yet, I wasn't close. I was in the middle of singing a song to myself. When I opened my eyes, the static in my eyes was VERY heavy, there were different small colored flashing lights (Mainly Green, blue and purple). Like, if they were tiny LED in the wall, yet just at that one spot. There was a large dark snake like figure going in a figure 8 around the lights. There was no definition to it. Just a shadow that constantly moved in my vision. As if it was chasing its tail.

I watched it for a couple of minutes before I realized I knew exactly which stuffed animal spoke to me. I got an overwhelming urge to go find her. I got up and started to look for her when I accidentally woke my daughter up. I then retreated into the bathroom until she falls back asleep.

I'm a gamer(18,M), and I love it but nowadays I just can't seem to enjoy it. Months ago I learnt a different way when I approach games like SMITE, Overwatch,Street Fighter, competitive games in general. I managed to be in this mindset, that I play to learn not to win. So while I did that I actually got better, learnt how to play other characters,classes, etc. It was a very good way for me to improve my skills and my mental health, since I'm a perfectionist, to the point that I get very sad and anxious when I do the smallest things wrong. It was a gateway for me to learn that I make mistakes and that's okay.

But lately Im falling at keeping that mindset. I don't know where it began but I just can't play games anymore, I just get anxious, I get mad when I do something wrong or I fail. in my first ranked match in Street Fighter I could hear my heartbeat like a bomb in my ears.

Gaming is the only way I have to distract myself, I've finished Avatar, a series that I really like. And in losing motivation in fashion,which is scary cuz I'm actually going to study that in university, and I'm scared that me liking fashion was some sort of a phase .

And I've also lost progress on my mental health, don't know how many months or weeks or was of me not self harming but I'm doing it again, everytime I fail a lot of times I just hide and start scratching my skin off, pulling my hair out or punching myself until I get a headache.

I've also just broke up with my first boyfriend, but I don't think him leaving me is the cause of this. I barely feel sad when I think of him.

Getting therapy is not something accesible to me right now, cuz of quarantine I can only do a zoom conference thingie or a phone call. I don't think that will be able to actually talk there or feel comfortable.

I just don't know what to do anymore, I was doing so good on my own but now, I don't know what to do.",05Sep2020,1
39,"Hello there all,

This is my first post on Reddit and I'm a little new to all the different forums. But trying to figure out my own mental health has been an arduous road so far. I figured that I might try finding people on a similar road through reddit.

Without going into too much detail, I want to explain where I've been in the last 4 years. Where I've sank. Where I've drifted. Where I might resurface. 

In 2016 I was diagnosed with ""Bipolar-1 with psychotic features."" What led up to that prior, was a life of drugs and debauchery, failed connections, unfinished (xyz), and what was becoming a very delusional me. 

I had become sick from lithium toxicity and was more impulsive than ever. In the course of 3 months I had 4 jobs. Tried lessening the dose, didn't seem to help. Eventually I decided I should stop taking my meds so I didn't end up vomiting and feeling like shit. I sold everything I owned and moved to Hawaii. A friend of mine moved there months before me and told me he'd help me find a job if I ever went, so I did. I cut ties with everyone else I knew and left. 

I had never done anything like this before. I was scared, excited, elated, terrified, and delusionally driven to make it to Ni'ihau island and live out my days, (if you know what island that is, thats a testament of how delusional I was at the time). I thought I would build a raft and arrive and would be treated like a God. And yes, the delusions were getting worse. 

I got on the plane and arrived in Oahu. I worked a sales job for all of 9 days. The very same job that my friend had ensured me upon my arrival. I was staying in a strangers apartment without her knowledge by way of a local word of mouth tip she was off island for a few months in Alaska. I was living in a free luxury on the 29th floor in the downtown Oahu area. 

One night, I made the mistake of trying to bond with my supervisor and the lead engineer by smoking some herbs with them. Very laid back dudes, island type. Yet as some of you may have experienced, delusions and grandiosities in a state of duress are not made any better when youre high... it gets much worse. In my experience at least. They said they were going to a party and asked if I wanted to go. I was too out of it to know how to answer. (I am also no newbie to a little buzz or being awkward when lit) But this was different. 

I crawled into the bed with the windows open and the sea breeze pouring through the room. My coworkers were confused, but at the time didn't really know anything about me. So they just left thinking I was just too high. My plan to get to Niiahu was racing through my mind. My anxiety was rattling like a marble in the washer machine. I panicked when they left and couldn't catch my breath.. it was hitting me that all I owned was in a bag on the floor and I had no one who knew what I was going through on the island. For the first time in a while, I realized I had no one. 

Strangely, that night was the first night I started to wonder if my mental health situation was something beside bipolar 1. I caved in on myself and contemplated jumping off the balcony to end the torment of psychological pain. Between walking to the balcony and the bed, a strange sound came from the window in the bedroom. It terrified me. Then it calmed me. Then I began to love it as if it were a song ive known my whole life. I crawled into the bed and listened. 
I heard the singing of a woman in Hawaiian. She was right outside my window...on the 29th floor. When I (as logically as I could at the time) realized what I had been listening too for hours, I caved again, terrified that I was right, I dont have psychotic features, I remember realizing in that moment I was at the beginning of a long road. The onset of schizophrenia. I was 25 at the time and had done enough reading on the probability of misdiagnosis between BP1 and Schizo(x) and it just made sense to me.
 
(Schizo(x) is written like that cause I knew I wouldn't be able to determine where on the spectrum of crazy I was. Maybe schizoaffective, maybe pure schizophrenia, maybe a mixture of symptoms, i didnt know for sure. Schizo(x) seems fair to use when you havent been diagnosed professionally but know with 90% certainly your hallucinations might be a variety of schizo symptoms. I digress. 

I had also gone to hawaii not only to get away and chase my delusional ideas, but to be at the wedding of a very old friend. The same friend that invited me and help me find work. He isn't very up to term on any aspects of mental health in general, so i knew telling him would just confuse things. I assumed he would've thought I was just high. And no, there was no PCP or anything in the weed either. I knew that that night was an unveiling of sorts. Something that would change me. 

Before all of this I had earned an AA from the local community College back in my home state. In the morning after that night of suicidal contemplation and listening to melodic ghosts, I knew I needed to find a way back into treatment and leave the island. I at that point was very driven to finsh my BA and make something of myself. I was just never stable enough to finish school before that. I wanted so desperately to change that. I arrived home after 12 days of what I thought was a move for good. 

So in 4 months time, I had worked 5 jobs, moved 3 times in 2 states, learned i was developing a worsened mental health condition (schizo(x)), ruined a longtime friendship, and wasted 3/4 of all the money I had to my name. 

So I tucked my tail between my legs and moved back in with my mom, found treatment, and was perscribed Rexulti at 3mg. I couldnt do too much then. I was increasingly paranoid. Anxious about anyone knowing that my big move had failed. And was simply depressed about what my mania had done to my life. Holding a stable job and having a few friends seemed like a distant dream for me then. 


But I buckled in and rode the ride I was on. I was accepted to the university I wanted to go to and started the following academic year. And to great relief, Rexulti started to work and my paranoia lessened, I started seeing more people, and I even rescued a dog and trained him to be my service animal. Things were getting better. 


I arrived in the college town and rented a 1 bedroom for me and pup, felt and acted normal, and was very driven to be at the top of my class. This was in 2018. 
For a whole year and half things were splendid. I met great people. Did great work in school. And I was on track to be at the top of my class. 

Then...unfortunately, I felt so good, I didn't feel the need to renew the forms that were required for me to get my meds. At the time Rexulti was still new on the market, so you either had to be super rich ($1800/refill rich), or you had to be accepted to Otsuka's financial assitance program to get the drug. I was so hesitant of side effects from other drugs (tardive-diskensia and others) that i only felt safe on rexulti. So I thought, fuck it, ill be fine :) 

It was the last 2 months of my senior year I ran out of pills. I normally got them in 3 month installments direct from the company. When I was down to 2 or 3 pills I tried to contact Otsuka and get back on the fin.aid. program I was initially on. (Oh that's the definition of procrastination btw...) But you needed a docotors referral to have it renewed. Since I was 27 at the time and could no longer afford my doctor, I had no one to help me process the application to Otsuka. But I continued to think. Fuck it. I'll be fine. 

Boy was I wrong lol. 

After 5 days without Rexulti, things became weird. An article I found about going cold turkey on heavy dose anti-psychotics was...how do i say..not recommended. 

First it was feelings of up and down. Days without food or sleep. Anxiety. Depression. Then the voices started. After 2 weeks of no meds I was heading into finals and had senior review for the work I had been doing. It was important for sure. I started to get to know the voices I heard. And became better friends with them than the people I knew in school. It was 3-12 people, speaking in alternation, similar to what I now know as third-party hallucinations. Then the thought broadcasting began... this was fun. 

I would go to class and hear what I thought were the thoughts of everyone in the class. 200 person classes. I would be in a cold sweat silently trying to take notes as my hands would shake and I would gaze over at the individuals I thought I was hearing. I would then start locking myself in my apartment. I stopped going to work. I started skipping class from the tremendous amounts of anxiety I would get from being around people and what I thought were their thoughts. Meanwhile I had a neighbor who was beating his GF. I kept a loaded gun by the door and almost never went out. I turned in all my assignments via email as best I could. By the time senior review came, I was tuned into voices that I was assuming were my dead relatives. It was partly comforting when that started to happen. But it qas only getting louder. 

I tried going to the ER but was told I needed to wait 30 minutes in a padded room if I wanted to be seen. This was protocol at the ER for all of the strung out junkies who came in for similar things.. (not that were that different..but I wasn't high) I freaked out thinking that protocol was a plan, specially concocted to kill me, a plan sent to the nursing staff by my professors. I was off. They told me they had never heard or Rexulti before. I tried asking for sedative so I could sleep, but that was also a no go. They then asked me again if I would wait in the room and gently showed me the interior. I freaked and cursed them all out and ripped off my bracelet and left and biked home. This was a moment that engraved in me two things. 

1- In a psychotic state, you're not as articulate as you think you are. Nor as calm as you should be. 

 2nd- the world will never help you if you can't explain your situation.

I biked home and then cleaned my apartment until dawn. I needed something to focus. And a 3rd thing. 

3- in a psychological state of duress, Focus on something safe. Clean, sing, read, workout, whatever. Just stay focused. It keeps the hallucinations to a minimum. In my experiences at least. 

And 4thly- psychosis is like seeing a color that doesn't exist. Keep that in mind when you're trying to blend in. 



A few days later I went to an urgent care that would see me. It was down the street from my apt. I met an awesome doctor that helped me fill out the fin.aid paperwork to Otsuka. But he also suggested that I start taking 10mg of olazapine to get through the withdrawal of Rexulti. I was hesitant at first, but I accepted. Side effects were of little concern to me then. I filled the script and carried on trying to blend in. I would over hear students in the studios talking about how I've been acting weird. I also would heard my grandparents and old friends (telling me to ignore them...but they're all dead.)  I was having trouble sifting through the volumes of the voices. Maybe I didn't hear other students, maybe that was me. I was too off to ask. But also, that would've been one awkward convo to have with my peers. So I continued to isolate. Olanzapine started to help. Things got quieter. I could sleep. 

The only peace I would find in those months off meds was out at the lake near campus, or at the dog park with my pup. I would drive manically down the country roads blasting Camille St. saens ""the swan"" on repeat trying to ask God for clarity and trying to converse with the dead. This info isn't that relevant. But it is important to find something that brings you a little joy. Even if have to be alone in the process. Even if the color you see doesn't exist. 


When senior reviews were happening I was so relived to be that close to graduation I wasn't even worried about being near the top of the class. I had a 3.9 and it dropped to a 3.5 in that time of duress. I still heard voices,  but I felt I had gotten to know them by then, it felt like I had invisible friends. 

During the senior review, in a stunning turn of events, I was showcased to the donors of the school as an exemplary student. I was over the moon when it was over. Not only had I completed my BA with a decent GPA. I did it with a dozen people in my head, all washed in a color that no had ever seen. 

Some of my family came to my graduation ceremony in June of that year (2019). The Olanzapine was working and it was starting to act more normal. I chose to have my own ceremony with my family out at the lake. The lake that to me, was my sanctuary. When everyone had arrived and we had my mini graduation ceremony, I played frank sinatras ""I did it my way."" I graduated in my own crazy way. 




After that I moved back home with my mom and started looking for work. During that time I had another episode. I stopped taking olanzapine cause I hadn't yet seen another doctor in my home town yet to have a refill written. IDIOTICALLY, I went off meds again. During that time I approached psychosis differently. I knew what was starting again. I began to hear those invisible friends of mine. But this time they weren't friendly. I was told to kill people. I was told to kill myself. I was told to kill the neighbors. I would stand outside naked and pray to the moon. I would wake up at 3am and start writing a book I would never share nor remember writing. I would be more aggressive. I would be smoke 2-3 packs of cigs a day. And I would over eat. Like a lot. When I left univereity I was 145lbs. Maybe it was the anti-psychotics. But by November of 2019. I was 215lbs. I was getting more depressed about my life, my weight, my isolation, the fact I was with my mom unable to stand on my own. So many things brought me down and set me ablaze. But I was also noticing I was getting more hostile. I was listening more to the voices that had changed. 

One day around August I loaded my gun and stuck it in my mouth. I put on Camille st. Saens the swan again and felt I was ready to die. My dog started whining at the door to the garage. In those whimpers I broke. I dropped the gun and let him in the garage and cried for about an hour. I knew that something in me was ruining my life. The color I couldn't describe was beginning to take my life force. 

Oscar, my dog. My angel. Saved my life. On more than one occasion he's done that. But it was then I immediately hopped online and looked up the nearest emergency mental health clinic. I took a bus and train across town to the clinic. The people there knew i was coming and welcomed me in a warm way that I didn't expect. I saw a doctor who did my intake  and scheduled me another visit for the next day with the resident psychologist. The next day I met with him and explained what I could. I tried to be as accurate as memory would allow me to be. He diagnosed me with Schizophrenia in August of 2019. A huge weight was taken off my shoulders. I was right. Hearing his reasoning and logic brought me back to earth. He got me back on Rexulti and set me up with another clinic near my home for med management and counseling visits. Something in that process of going to the clinic gave me hope. I saw nothing but faces of people who wanted to help. My only problem was letting them.

After months of counseling and trying to figure out how and why my brain works the way it does, Ive learned many things. (This list is in no particular order.) 

1- no one in the worls really understands the origins of schizophrenia. So don't try and assume you'll be able to. And don't listen to people who think they know. Its like asking for the cure to cancer. It doesn't exist. We have treatments. But were just not there yet as a people. 

2- ask for help before you start putting guns in your mouth....or ""before"" you actually run out of meds. 

3- when the voices you hear turn hostile, things are getting worse. Seek help. NOW! 

4- weight gain is going to happen on anti-psychotics. But its the lesser of two evils. 

5- get a dog. They are on this earth to guide us toward a better version on ourselves. 

6- don't try quitting cigarettes during a psychotic episode. Never works. Its also the lesser of 2 evils. 

7- conversing with your voices should be done in private. Trust me. 

8- thought broadcasting is very uncomfortable. But its a variety of dulsionary thinking. Remember that. Its not real.

9- dont laugh out loud when one of your voices tells a joke. Its awkward. 

10- (VERY IMPORTANT) keep a journal, as best you can, during the moments of psychosis, if not all the time. This will help you in the future when you've made it to the other side. And some practitioners find it to be a valuable resource in therapy to reference. And, hindsight into psychosis is hard. Your memory will be segmented. Having written notes on delusions and feelings and voices and phrases, et al. Will help you recognize them again in the future and remind you that its only a part of your delusionary thinking. Its like a defense tactic. 

11- don't smoke weed. During psychosis. As good as it seems to relax. It will make the volume of your delusions MUCH higher. 

12- find a place of peace. Literal or imaginary. But find it. Everyone needs sanctuary. Period. 

13- paranoia is a bitch. But its a lie. It will tear you from your friends and family. Try your best to noteate what it is EXACTLY that paranoid about. Then work it backward. Logically. 
Ex) You might think that the government has vehicles outside your apartment. 

Run the plate if you need to using TruthFinder. I guarantee its a neighbor or a stranger.. not a fed. Not a threat. Paranoia is an enigmatic bitch. Try your best to be logical about it. 

14- don't own weapons if you're unstable. They open a door to dark impulsivities. 

15- don't forget to focus on something REAL, during times of delusions. Its your only chance at staying connected to reality. Or better yet,  call someone you can trust and tell them about your delusion(s) and listen to how ridiculous you sound. Then write down those conclusions. Reread them everyday if you have to. 

16- don't go cold turkey off anti-psychotics. Those foldable pamphlets about the drug youre taking that you always throw away when you get your meds are legit. Read them. 

17- don't Google shit when your paranoid. Delusionary. Or stressed. Youll fall in a vortex that either makes you more delusionary or it will give you a false sense of competency. Theres a reason doctors have phds and you don't. 

18- avoid people if you need to. A social life can be rebuilt. Not everyone will understand your situation. 

19- family matters. If you have one, ask them for help. Confide in them. If not, find one through a group, your friends, or in your community. (If your family happens to be a bunch of faith healers. Fuck that, find a new one) 

20- music will save your soul. Make a Playlist for when things are getting weird, hard, etc. Try to stick to calm music. Satie is great. 


For those of you who actually read this, thank you. I am a very private person who is by no means a role model or even someone who ever posts stuff like this. I suppose I wanted to throw part of my story into the electrical ether we call the internet, for catharsis sake. I don't give a shit about up votes or down votes or whatever. I just wanted to write something honest. Something that I still yet don't fully know how to explain. 

I do hope though that if anyone who reads this is struggling with mental health, of any kind, learn where your resources are; An emergency clinic, a doctor, a friend, a family member, a dog. Rely on these resources. ""It takes a village"" doesnt only apply to children. You are loved by someone, use that knowledge to look over the fence to the other side. Take each day at a time. Being hostile is never the answer. Medications are there to help, don't feel like its robbing you of something.

Lastly, having a mental health condition does not define you. It never will. Only unless you let it.

I feel like if I move I’m just going to throw up everywhere and I’ve been feeling shakey as well the whole night. Can anyone tell me ways to help this? How long it’s meant to last?

42,"I (17m) don’t seem to react to sad, angering, or happy situations like others, for example I’ve been to multiple funerals for close family members (grandmother or very close uncle) and I seem to be the only person not crying. There have also been other situations where people are literally in a screaming match (which absolutely terrifies me when men are screaming) and I’m so confused and it’s gotten to the point where I think they all have a short fuse or I just don’t have one at all because I’ve never screamed at somebody like that or even got close. I thought that maybe because of my social anxiety I’m just not social enough or not that in touch with my feelings. Idk what it is but I’d really like to know if anyone can tell me.",05Sep2020,1
43,"No. I was not good in this scenario at all, initially. But you know the saying; we grow with time. My first relationship lasted for 4 years. I was in class 9 when it all started. So you can imagine that age and the level of maturity I carried in myself. Frankly speaking, it was no more than 20% of what I have now. But yet it lasted for 4 years.

The tenure of my second relationship was 2 years and 6 months. And I was in my 1st year of college life. Things did not work out eventually in the end. I do feel down sometimes, but what can do one do. We move on…

But, I learned many new things about human nature. Not just that, I learned the way of life. This blog is all about how you can approach in maintaining a healthy relationship so that things do not fall out of place.

Hi guys! This is Rijoy here. In this particular blog, I will share with you the most important and valuable tips for a healthy relationship which I have learned from my real-life experiences and some that I have collected from reading blogs and articles.

I aim to provide you with as much knowledge and tips and steps, that if you follow, you will have a healthy relationship filled with fulfillment and lasting happiness.

So let us dig in…

Below are the tips for a healthy relationship that I would personally like to share with each one of you. It is based on my real-life experiences and some from the best blogs and articles that I came across during this time.

Heartbreaks are quite painful. Trust me I know the pain. Therefore I would love to see your relationship flourish and avoid disconnection of any sort.

Here we go…

## 1. HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.

How to gain trust? Be honest, always. It helps to build trust. When you are honest with one another, you learn to trust one another respectively. It erodes away the suspicion and the thoughts of things being kept secret or hidden from you thus paving the way to a healthy relationship.

And naturally, you feel at ease in your mind and gut because you know that your partner cares enough to tell you the truth. It may not always feel good at times. The thing is you can actually appreciate the fact that your partner is being vulnerable here by being honest.

Your partner is taking a chance here by speaking what is true. When your partner speaks the truth, it is because your partner cares about you and wants a relationship with honesty and truth in its foundation.

It certainly does help you to grow your relationship without any psychological hindrance. It helps you to solve problems as well. Misunderstandings can happen at times.

By being honest, you can work through the misunderstandings and communicate to solve the issue and get going.

When you are being honest, it helps your partner to understand your past, present, and future. Your partner can begin to understand the situation, which you are, and what needs to happen to grow each part in your life.

I believe honesty expresses genuine and caring love. If I love someone I see my future with them. If you love best and you are super honest, and you want to protect them from this evil world, I highly recommend you to be honest because seeing your partner damaged or hurt isn’t something thing you want. Isn’t it?

## 2. BEING YOU.

I was always an introvert. I used to get nervous when it came to social gatherings in public places. I hate crowds. I still do. That’s how I am. If you accept me the way I am we are good to go. Or else different paths will suit us better. Yeah, this is me.

But you, you can be exactly the opposite. It does not matter if you are an introvert or you like to meet new people or parties around.

My point is you have to be yourself completely in order for your partner to understand what type of human being you actually are. The more you let your partner understand, the deeper the bond goes and vice-versa which results in a healthy relationship.

Being in a relationship does not mean that you cannot go out with your friends or have personal space or indulge in your hobbies. No. It is definitely nothing like that. But there should be a limit and a boundary to everything. Anything too much good is definitely not good at all.

If you want your relationship to flourish you have to be interdependent which means both you and your partner have to have a balance between each other. You have to believe in your individual worth and independent ability and also give lovingly towards the relationship and working as a couple.

45,"Hey guys. First post here, I didn’t know where else to
turn to. 

My brother just texted me and told me that he is at the end of his rope mentally and his depression has never been worse despite doing everything he can. He hasn’t had a conversation with someone in 2 weeks and he says he is so lonely and miserable. 
He exercises, takes cold showers, wakes up early, eats healthy, etc., but nothing works anymore. He tries to reach out to the few friends he has, but they either don’t reply or are too busy. 

In all honesty, my depression/ suicidal thoughts is really bad as well and I am in no position to take care of anyone else bc it's difficult for me to even take care of myself. 

I don't know how to approach this situation and help him without hurting my own mental health and I don't have money to help him or me get therapy. I'm spending tomorrow morning with him but besides that, I truly don't know how to help him in the long run.

Some background on us: 
- We grew up in a cult
- We had an extremely strict and crazy family life
- Our emotionally abusive dad had a stroke and become essentially a vegetable when we were in college
- My brother came out to me that he was gay last year, and revealed that he tried to get conversion therapy when he was younger bc he was scared of going to hell. 
- I recently just moved out of our parents house but he’s stuck there still with my mom (who is also nuts) and my disabled father. 

Any pieces of advice or resources to help? I truly don’t know what to do. Thank you guys in advance ❤️

47,"Idrk where to start, this is my first time posting on reddit even tho i use it like all the time, i really honestly feel like i have no where else to turn to

I have been feeling really down lately, i have lost interest in everything that used to make me happy - playing w my dog, talking to my friends/family, even schoolwork!, playing sports, etc. I feel like ive really been isolated and away from my friends. I've been studying for my MCAT test while balancing a full course load, and decided to move away to campus to get away from home stress and focus on my work. 

I ended up having to drop most of my course bc i couldn't follow thru with my finals bc of my mental health and I have not done as much studying for my MCAT as i would've hoped to even tho my test is in one week.

I am usually a happy, positive person. I am the one thats there for everyone, literally take care of almost everyone in my life. but for the last couple months/year, i can barely get out of bed. sometimes i dont. sometimes i just lay in bed and cry all day. 

my boyfriend and i have fought a lot in the past year, i spent a lot of time supporting him thru his issues and many times he'd take out his anger on me. we broke up and got back together after a bit and it was better, he was a lot different. i tried to tell him how ive been feeling lately tho, that i was feeling suicidal yesterday and the next day he tried to help me but, ended up yelling at me bc he was frustrated that he was trying to help and i was being closed off. 

&amp;#x200B;

its not like i want to be closed off, its just really hard for me to open up sometimes if i dont feel like i am being listened to. 

i feel really alone. especially bc i tried to talk to him, tried to get him to understand, and he kind of just brushed me off and that hurt a lot. i feel so over everything, like i just cant do this anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

i dont see my future being very bright if i cant even sit down and study for my mcat or finish a term at school. i feel so closed off from my friends, from everyone. i just dont want to live anymore

ive tried and im so unhappy every day idk how to release my stress

ive had many panic attacks lately and idk how to cope with those either

48,"TW // food, mentioned medications, mentioned depression

My mom said that I swallowed a penny when I was three and had to get it surgically removed. Even though I don’t remember anything of it, I’ve been terrified of swallowing pills since (which isn’t great because I’m a hypochondriac). There was even a point in time where I was scared to swallow certain chunks of food.

Even today I got a heart attack when a string from an asparagus got caught or took to long to go down. It’s not uncommon for me to almost swallow a piece of food, but then get a sudden scary feeling and bring it back to my mouth. 

Other than the eating aspect, this never really caused an issue until I got started getting frequent migraines and my parents would try to give me medicine— I hated the taste of chewables, so I just didn’t take them. I’d sweat out my fever, sit through my paralyzingly period cramps, and wait for my migraine to go away. 

And at age 18, I still do that... I got sick last November (a flu that lasted nearly a month, my lymph nodes were so swollen that I couldn’t drink water without crying) and I finally went to the doctor, who told me I should take certain pills to make it better. I tried, but I couldn’t, I tried it in food, I tried crushing it and drinking it, I tried it with water, I tried halfing it, nothing worked... so I just didn’t take it and luckily I got better.

But what scares me is that I may need to swallow a pill one day and the thought of that makes me keep information from my doctors. I don’t ask for a mental health diagnostic despite being so sure I’m depressed. I don’t tell my doctor that my period has been irregular since I was 12.

Even just seeing people swallow pills in movies makes me a bit squeamish. I know this isn’t sustainable—I won’t even take vitamins for gods sake— and I don’t know what to do.",05Sep2020,1
49,"I have a really hard time talking about my emotions with others and an even harder time showing/feeling emotions. I have felt numb for an extremely long time. I don't think i can remember a time when i didn't feel detached. There has been so many times when i want to tell people how i feel on the inside but it feels impossible, like i can't fathom ever doing it. It gives me a lot of stress too, the only way i can sleep at night is if i am listening to something or extremely tired e.g. 24hrs without sleep because otherwise i lie in bed thinking about the future and past mistakes and others who are better than me and how i am worthless - then i look out my window and think how much stress would be lifted off my shoulders if i just jumped, how i wouldn't have to worry anymore. Its like i get locked in a room with my thoughts just popping up over and over again. The only reason i am writing this right now is because i couldn't sleep because i kept thinking. 

I have really bad trust issues. I don't trust anyone. Not my friends, not my family, nobody. I think i this is because of prank that was played on me a long time ago that i don't feel comfortable going into detail on (it involved members of my family who i trusted a lot basically humiliating me in front of pretty much everybody i knew). This may be part of the reason i have a really hard time talking about my emotions to those i know. This leads to me just feeling empty and alone. I have nobody to talk to. I cant talk to anyone about my problems. They just stay with me and grow. Another problem that grew out of the event i mentioned was that i hate being noticed. (this specific issue part has gotten a little better btw) I used to walk pretty fast and look directly down because i just couldn't make eye contact with others. This has gotten better though as my friends pointed it out to me but now i walk with my head up, i still avoid eye contact thoroughly though. I say no to some social interactions because i dont want to be noticed. I dont talk too much because i dont want to be noticed. I avoid large groups of people as to not be noticed. i am scared to commit to things like relationships and certain social activities. This further makes me feel more alone and lost. I tunnel myself into video games to avoid thinking about these things. I'm afraid things won't ever change. I've never done one of these things before so i dont really know how to end it so il stop here",05Sep2020,1

52,"My sister and I have always had issues with depression, anger, anxiety, mixed with periods of being okay. My mom has history of depressive episodes, extreme anxiety, eating disorder, anger issues (that are more common with menopause), and periods of manic spending (more common with menopause) and was recently diagnosed with bipolar, depression, and childhood ptsd. My mom's sister is diagnosed with everything from bipolar to ADHD.  My maternal grandma (mom's mom) and maternal great grandmother (mom's grandma) have history of abandoning family, running away, manic spending, drug and alcohol abuse, lying, and theft. We're all tall and overweight and the ones I've asked we all have irregular periods.

My sister, me, and my mother all have irregular menstrual cycles. I've noticed it almost seems like my PMS I'd opposite of the typical cycle, where I feel good for a few days during my cycle when most women have pms and feel bad. Then for the rest of the time without my period, I feel emotionally bad. 

I recently was pregnant and had a baby and while I was pregnant was the best I've ever felt. No moodiness. My anxiety was my mostly gone. My depression was non existent. I woke up happy and slept well and wasn't mad and annoyed all the time for no reason. I talked to my mom about it and she said she felt the same during her three pregnancies but went back to feeling after within months of giving birth. I'm five months post partum and im starting to feel the depression and anxiety creeping back in. 

I've talked a little about this to the doctor that diagnosed me with bipolar rapid cycling, but he seemed to think I was just talking about regular pms and tried to reassure me that I'm bipolar. I have an appointment with a general practitioner that listens to me and I want to ask about possibly looking into what I can do to check my hormones, but I'm not sure if it's even worth it. Are there hormonal mental health issue that this may be? Should I just accept the bipolar diagnosis? I've had my hormones tested before and all I remember was that I was extremely low in testosterone for a woman. I was given birth control at that time but it made me sob uncontrollably and I had to stop it within a few days. 

Any ideas? Where would you start on getting answers?

55,"Here’s a verse to a song for my brother. I just want you to know you’re walking for a purpose, you’re walking for a reason. You’re loved, you’ve come this far and you need to continue. Wake up, go outside, look at the world differently. Think about the positive things you want to attract and those things will come. You’re loved.




I woke up one morning and saw that you didn’t text me
You never answered anyways and always told me stop the stressing
I called my mom i had a dream 
It Didn’t fit the puzzle cause some peices of my heart fell off I think it’s bout to crumble  
She said baby not a dream
But a visit from your brother cause you
Gotta know he loves you one last time is what it seems 
Told me Sorry but he did it, i was gonna wait to tell you but there’s no pretending
He cut his throat I start the vision 
Crying in the bathroom and to die was his mission 
Knife in hand began to cut cannot survive wheres the ending 
Jay I’m sorry that you had to go through what you did 
It’s unexplainable the words are unattainable 
In your eyes it’s all lies, and our lives don’t mean too much when outside don’t give a fuck 
The part time don’t pay enough 
But who am I to judge but just mere kid I’m older now 
You sit around and wonder why the world is cold and figure out 
That blood don’t make you fam it’s gotta come from the soul 
You should have never let your “friends” start up taking control 
Begin to give up all your time so they can save up their own
Then try to give it all back the day you died all alone... damn

Because of you I am the way I am today tomorrow and the next I’ll never fade away 
And if you dropped the knife I’d never be the same 
I’d probably never care 
I’d probably never change 
And now I’m never scared 
With you I grew my wings 

The biggest lesson life can teach is taught from inside 
If you would have dropped the knife you could have learned this in time 
There is no time stamp
Get caught up in lies and
You start to see the world in 
The same mess that you’re in 
Arguments with momma turn your head into a whirlwind you know she knows you best but she can’t save you from the worlds sin

Some ask...

Why death? 



Don’t even answer
blood would come up out your neck with every noun and every breath 
But  every now and then I check
Just to make sure you ain’t playing with me 


And now I walk my path  with your shoes on my feet
I don’t care if they got holes,scuffs, are broken and beat  
I’ll forever tell the story of you choosing defeat 
If not, you’re just another n*gga who got caught in the streets.

56,"For about 2 weeks or so I had slipped into the genuine belief that I was communicating to people via social media posts in secret. Like, they were trying to talk to me through their posts, stories, bios, etc. There was no doubt in my mind. This has happened before, but I questioned myself when I had these thoughts, and they were only brief. But this time was different. For the record, I am 70% sure none of it happened at this point, so I'm a little worried. Also, during this state, my arms looked like they didn't belong to me. I don't know if it is connected but thinking of it all makes me panicked. I'm too afraid to admit this because in retrospect, the idea of having a secret communication with people online is so stupid to me now. I don't want to lose grip on reality, but the feeling was so real, how can I even distinguish delusions from reality??",05Sep2020,1

Like that person literally wants to kill themself and the first thing you think of is to bring up other people, and make them feel even worse for what they already feel bad about?? What?? I know the main motive is to keep them here, but it just doesn’t sit right with me. I’ve been told it many times, and it has worked. It’s the reason I’m still able to type this right now.

58,"I moved last winter, so I’m nervous about talking to my current psych about my desire to come off my meds and whether I still meet diagnosis criteria.

I have been on meds for about three years now after my mental health got really bad. I did some serious long term treatment and therapy programs, kept up with a regular therapist I was able to stop seeing before my move, and I’ve been stable with my mental health and those around me agree. No panic attacks, any anxiety and depression symptoms that come up I’m able to manage, and some ADD symptoms that don’t get in the way of daily life. I take seroquel to help me sleep and I’m on a small dose of intuniv for the ADD symptoms so I can focus better at work. My goal would be able to sleep without the meds and only need the ADD one if there were no other ways to manage my symptoms. I want to start a family and I’ve heard that meds aren’t always doable when pregnant and nursing, so I question if I really need to stay on them.

I also question if I still meet the criteria for the BPD diagnosis I got in treatment. Thanks to treatment and therapy, the symptoms I once had when I got that diagnosis have, to myself and my husband at least, gone away and I haven’t had to deal with them in a long time. This is what I really mean by I feel stable with my mental health.

So I guess the real question is, since this is a relatively new doctor still, how do I bring up these topics with them? What do you think a good/safe plan (even if it’s a long term plan) would be for becoming med free? What should this conversation with them be like?",05Sep2020,1

I wish I could know and other times I wish I could just take every pill in my Fluoxetine bottle and maybe feel happy for once. I've never self harmed besides maybe hitting my head against the wall in desperation to feel anything other than sadness. I spend a'lot of time alone especially because I tend to self-isolate myself from other people in an attempt to protect myself? In order to lower my self-esteem I tend to say ""you like it"" to myself. There's a'lot of cycles running through my mind at all times and it feel's like i'm running on all cylinders constantly. I'f anyone wants to know what I'm diagnosed with it's ""Major Depressive Order and General Anxiety"". Sometimes I experience these bursts of wanting to help myself and do good things, but generally it never works. Maybe I've been misdiagnosed but it's all speculation. Sometimes I feel guilty because I think I use people to satisfy some sick need for attention and love in my brain even though it's probably not any real connection but it might just be me keeping myself down, cause you know how depression works. I'd like to improve but I just don't care enough to care to improve. I just applied to a job in order for family members to think more highly of me even though I can't even get myself to school without having panic attacks which is just pathetic.

64," Hello, I am a female in mid 20s, I have depression and I don't really know nor diagnosed but I think I have social anxiety. And my childhood is pretty bad, I was physically abused by my parents but as I grow up, they started to mentally abused me, not physical anymore. Everyday I passed the day, waking up, sweep the house, getting yelled at by my mom saying that I'm dumb etc etc. I've been depressed for almost 2 years now, and good news is I'm starting a new job last week (yaay!) as my last job is full of toxic people. Right now I haven't start to do any task yet but instead my company is giving me and some other people with me who just got hired, an online training using zoom. The session started at 07.30 am to 4.30 pm, every weekdays. In this online training, there is a mentor and their helper who helped with the power point slides. We do discussion a lot, but the problem is, I can't seem to think anything at all. I also can't speak out like there is nothing in my mind, to think, to say, to absorbed any lesson into my brain. I can't even answer to some simple question as ""what comes into your mind when you hear a word ""support""?"". Like, I know what ""support"" means, but I really can't say it, can't elaborate more, I just can't think. I just feels like a body, with no connection to anything at all, I can't feel happiness, or sadness, can't even grasp any words. I just empty. I really wanted to change but my brain seem can't cooperate with me. And also some people who on training with me are very active. Discuss a lot, speak up more. But why can't I? I also easily forgot, so I was constantly writing notes while on my training session. But the words are just words, it can't seem to get into my mind. I've tried to watch all youtube videos about leadership, people management which are some of the training lesson, but I still empty like I can't even remember what the youtube videos says. I've had some bad memories that I've been trying to block for a while, is that affecting how my brain works? Or am I just dumb?

i was 17, driving home from my high school. my memory is cloudy but i believe the upcoming light had just turned red and everyone was slowing down to a stop. i think i made a complete stop and saw this as a chance to look down at my car radio and change the music. i must’ve let my foot come off the brake or tried to inch forward a bit but wasn’t paying full attention to how close i was to the car in front of me, and before i could brake again, i rear ended the car in front of me. i followed her to an empty parking lot and checked for damage which turned out to be minimal (a few scratches on both our cars). i was a mess since this was my first accident and the car i was driving was my aunts, not mine so i really had no idea what to do. i gave her my parents phone numbers and later that night the lady i hit called my parents letting us know that it was nothing to worry about.

she was very kind and i’m so grateful for that and the fact that no one was hurt, but i feel so much shame still. there were 3 people in her car, two children. i feel terrible knowing i could’ve hurt them with my carelessness. sure it was a hit going less than 5 mph but i still feel so stupid knowing i could’ve avoided it all together. i definitely learned from it, and after that incident i drove with a lot more attentiveness and caution. i know i can’t do anything about it anymore and it has no effect on my life right now, but i can’t help but feel ashamed. if anyone has any advice how to let go, it would be appreciated.",05Sep2020,1

One example of how this affects my life is that I have minimal (if any) patience for white people. For example, If I encounter a POC in public, say they accidentally bump into me while walking, I really wouldn’t bat an eyelash. If a white person did it, it would leave me at rage.

I say all this not out of kindness and sympathy for white people by any means.. I couldn’t give a shit if I tried. I say this because I live in a white majority country and I owe it to myself to at least be at peace with them so I don’t go crazy, but I honestly don’t know how.",05Sep2020,1

But no matter how hard I tried I could never be normal, I could never measure up with those around me, I would always be the ugliest in any room and I was always going to be the stupidest person I know incapable of achieving anything substantial by myself.
So giving up on trying to fit in, leaving everyone behind in the process, sure made my day to day life easier, I no longer had any more unfathomable goal to reach, no more trying to reach a weight goal, no more trying to appear put together... it felt absolutely liberating.

82,"Hi, 

I knew there is a lot wrong with the situation I'm in and I know they do it on purpose. My mother has been using pretty much all of the manipulation tactics. My stepfather is using them also. Even worse they have made others join them. My psychologist is gaslighting me. And the state wants me to voluntarily go to a mental health hospital, otherwise they will make it happen against my will. For example. My mother's boyfriend called me a whore. I told my mother. She just looked at me weird. She didnt tell him to apologize me. She went to his house to fuck him. I got mad and destroyed a few things in the living room. Which landed me in the group homes. When I talked about it with her 3 weeks ago. Since they all like to say that there is something wrong with me and that I have issues. When I said it wasnt normal to just let your boyfriend call your daughter a whore. She said 'and weren't you?' Now I'm out of group homes after 4 years. I'm staying with my mother and stepfather. They like threaten me with passive aggressive comments all the time. Or with body language. Yesterday my stepfather was saying that he would know how and like to help people like me (when talking about how he would ""help"" the people from the homeless shelter I was at). He was saying he'd get some chains big like a fist and chain them in the shed. He'd beat them and stuff. Even got a broom stick, made gestures with it and said that it would do the job. They talk about me when I'm not around, but do it so I can hear them. Always complaining about me and saying I'm ungrateful. My mother was talking to their friend on phone and she told him about the message I sent her. I asked her if she wanted me to go downstairs. Their friend was saying ""tell her to come and then tell her to go, then she will learn"". And that people around me will know that I'm fucked up. My mother was laughing all the time. She opened the door to the upstairs on purpose so I will hear the conversation. My psychologist says that she has a gut feeling that there is something I'm hiding. I told her I want to know what I'm hiding. She says she doesnt know. She just has a gut feeling. My mother told me that the other psychologist sees straight through me. They want me in the mental hospital very bad. They threaten me that if I dont go they will make me go against my will. I read an article that said I should speak to someone about this. I cant even talk to my psychologist since they are doing this too. What is the best thing I can do. They want me in the mental hospital really bad. And I've heard that for people like me it's worse than prison. What should I do to not end up there. Police took my ID (pretty much stole it when they were searching through my backpack) I found out it isnt there at the homeless shelter. My stepfather told me that I cant go anywhere without my ID. Since I wanted to move abroad. I live in a country where the average wait time for a house is 8 years. I got 6 more to go.",05Sep2020,1

86,"Lately the more I research into it the more I think I am a covert narcissist. I don’t consider myself superior to people and actually have some pretty low self esteem but I always feel that first itch of jealousy or envy or “how did you manage to do that?” whenever anyone I’m close to accomplished something. I never vocalise it and it’s just a fleeting thought but I am disgusted by it. 

In my new relationship with my boyfriend, I’ve noticed a lot of old bad behaviours resurfacing. For example, me getting easily irritated by what he says, getting annoyed that the conversation isn’t going in the direction I want it to. Shutting him out emotionally/lashing out. We talk over it and I always say sorry if I know that I was in the wrong or if I definitely overreacted. It’s been completely eating at me the way I’ve been behaving with him and he told me he feels like I’m pushing him out the closer we get ready to go back to university (we’re planning long distance). I’m terrified that I’m turning into an emotionally abusive person and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been doing things that I KNOW are unreasonable and I can feel how stupid I’m being but my anger just takes over. 

I’ve been up all night just feeling an intense amount of sickness at the possibility of being a covert narcissist. Everybody always says how I’m one of the nicest/most thoughtful people they’ve met but secretly they don’t know that I have a lot of intense negative thoughts (to be fair, mostly about myself). Sometimes I think I’m just giving a very inaccurate version of myself to people - I enjoy being nice to people and helping out, it gives me a sense of accomplishment but I also do genuinely want these people to be happy too. But I second guess myself and wonder if I’m doing these acts of kindness because I’m secretly a narcissist who feeds off of good impressions.",05Sep2020,1
87,"There are some days, like today when i feel my mental health going back to shit again. Its like an onset of a migraine, starts with a dull pain and then its a proper explosion of pain for god knows how many days or weeks. 
I always try to be stay happy but its really difficult because my brain wont let me. I've always been an anxious person as a kid and i have trouble adjusting to things that are not in my plan. I expect the best from myself and if i don't do my best, it takes a huge toll on my mental health. 
A lot has changed in my life, it feels like its been uprooted and i cant help but feel helpless. I've become numb, I've stopped feeling things but suddenly out of the blue while working or just in between some chore, i get this sudden burst of emotions and theyre not good ones. 
When the depression starts to hit, i start to get productive. Like really really productive. I work on projects, study. So thats one good thing i get out of it. 
I feel trapped in my head, i want to be set free.
I want to know what its like to be happy and i want the anxiety to vanish. 
And the fact that our lives have no significant meaning and everything we do will ultimately make no difference to the universe is terrifying.

94,"So, Im looking for a direction to be pointed into for what Im dealing with. Im located in Michigan &amp; have no clue whats going on with me or why Ive always been like this. Also, Im curious if there’s anyone else that has these same problems. 

So, at the beginning of the year, I had a guy take me out to dinner a few times. After I realized he considered it a date, I pretty much became obsessed with thinking about him. I wouldn’t text him first or constantly like his posts online or anything like that. I think I do a good job at just keeping the obsession in my head &amp; not harass them. However, I will spend hours going through their pictures &amp; things like that. Anyways, things just didn’t work out (we wanted different things in life) so I agreed with him &amp; we stopped seeing each other. I did continue for the next month to obsessively think of him. Im talking every waking minute I was thinking about him. Im not sure when or how I stopped thinking about him, Im guessing I found something else to do?

The most recent deal happened the other day. I watched a musical for the first time (wont say which one, though it could probably be easily guessed) &amp; here I am obsessed with the lead actor. I mean, **obsessed**. I know he doesn’t know who I am, I don’t think that he’s in love with me or anything like that. But Ive watched the musical every single night since then &amp; Ive had the soundtrack on around the clock. I think the part that got me was I spent 4 hours tonight going through his pictures on twitter. Last night after I got done with the musical, I was on YouTube watching every video hes in. I was up until 6am just watching video after video. Like I said earlier though, I dont reach out or anything because I don’t want to harass anyone. Tonight I figured whats the point of going to sleep when I could stay up &amp; listen to the music. I know this is just a “me” thing. I just feel like I need to see pictures/videos of him constantly. When Im not looking at pictures of him, Im constantly thinking of him. I know he’s not the character in the show, I know the persona he puts on in interviews probably isnt who he is. But let me tell you, my brain just doesn’t care &amp; just takes whatever it’ll get. He could end up the worst person on earth &amp; I would still be so obsessed with him. I get that I dont have a shot, but that doesn’t shut me down. 

I had a friend mention that maybe its quarantine or the “honeymoon phase” when dating irl. However, Ive **always** been like this. My last relationship was 5 years &amp; I was living with him for a few of those years. But all of those years, I never stopped obsessing. He was all I would think about—all day, everyday, nonstop. When things would get rocky, I would spend all day, everyday thinking about anything that could’ve caused it, or what to do to make it better. It was so intense that when I’d be in class, I wouldn’t realize that I stopped listening to the professor &amp; I was in my head. Like my thoughts were so loud in my head that when Id catch myself &amp; stop it. The sound in the room would be dead silent but then have the effect that someones turning the volume up. Ive spent many classes just in another world &amp; I cant seem to stop myself. I just zone out &amp; eventually I catch it, try to focus &amp; at some point I just go back out. Its not like my classes aren’t interesting either, they’re everything Im interested in &amp; doing in my career. 

Ive always been in long term relationships (2 total). I think the first one was 4 years, the other was 5. Both I was absolutely obsessed with, but apparently neither guys have ever known. When I left my last boyfriend I told him I couldn’t be with him for many reasons, but the big one being that I couldn’t stop thinking of him &amp; it was exhausting &amp; took such a toll on my mental health. At some point I just stop thinking about them though, but I apparently find something new to obsess over. I haven’t pinpointed what though, because this seems to come in waves. 

I will say I decided I needed to stop dating after the last guy I went out with. I just worry that these obsessive thoughts are going to drop my grades or that I’ll lose my career over it. I thought that was going to solve my problem, but here I am months later obsessing over a celebrity. This hasn’t been the first time obsessing over a celebrity though. 

When I was a kid, I started with the love obsession with Zac Efron in high school musical. My walls were covered in pictures of him. I had all of the HSM merch, I would watch the movies over &amp; over, I had the bedding, everything. I remember I was always thinking about him. I think I was about 8 when I started this. My mom always worried about it, but everyone told her it was just a phase. But the phase of obsession just hasn’t left. 

When I was in middle school, I became obsessed with Michael Jackson. I owned all his albums, movies, documentaries, pictures, magazines, etc. I listened to his music on repeat for 3 years. I wouldn’t allow any song that wasn’t MJ on my iPod. 

Ive never met anyone who’s had the same problem. I think the scariest thing is the loud thoughts that completely drown everything out (which, I already mentioned). I don’t realize they’re loud until I stop them &amp; then the sound of the room hurts my ears for a minute. While typing this up, Ive probably zoned out 5 or 6 times on my celebrity. I just apparently kept typing while zoned but then would realize I was trying &amp; snap back to it. So, this post is probably all over the place but Ive tried to reread what Ive typed to make sure it was what I was trying to say. 

I just think the older I get, the more intense &amp; louder these thoughts get. They’re not negative thoughts &amp; I can control them to an extent. They’re just....made up scenarios, pictures, scenes from movies they’re in, anything. I did see a therapist when I was a teen but she never brought up anything obsessive. She just figured I was obsessed because it was my first relationship/breakup. 

Im open to anything to cope until places start opening up a bit. Im back to school &amp; Im falling back into the thoughts 24/7 &amp; struggling to focus. I tried cutting off all connections/music/movies before in the past, &amp; for some reason it just doesn’t help. It seems to just intensify the thoughts &amp; make it so much harder to get out of. Id love to say “oh these waves only last a month” but they all vary. This one could be a week, or could be the next 10 years &amp; itll just get more intense as time goes on.",05Sep2020,1

96,"I have a friend who was very normal before her crush who we thought would be her boyfriend, suddenly introduced a new girl. Anyway, things started to change from here. She would always eat at fancy restaurants and was always concerned with how people saw her. 

This year she started getting botox and fillers, going to expensive gyms, and so many other expensive stuff. She said she’s investing in herself because she wanted to be an actress and an established social media star (like charli d’amelio)  someday. Her credit card bill reached 2k USD and borrowed money from various different people (even people she did not know) just to pay it off. Now here, I though she paid off the card. Unfortunately, she didn’t. Instead, what she did with the borrowed money, she used it to fund her expensive lifestyle. Her debt now to the card and from the different people is now at at least 5-6k USD. She’s not paying for her rent, her bills because any money handed to her would automatically go to her face and body (she’s planning to get breast implants too even though she can’t afford it). She’s sleeping with different wealthy men just to fund her lifestyle. She would even save a cheeseburger for 5 days just to save money for botox. She’s very messy in the house and is only clean with herself.

I am very afraid for her because the people whom she borrowed money from is starting to harass her but she just can’t see the importance of paying them first instead of paying for her expensive treatments. She said she will become a star someday and will be so rich from being a movie star/ social media star and that’s when she will pay them. Who knows how long this will take? I’m worried this will eventually kill her because her debt is so huge now. I don’t even know why she’s so obsessed with her looks! She’s already a very beautiful girl.

Do you think this is becoming a mental disorder now?

This is my first time posting here, and I'm getting into the swing of reddit. I'm 26 and from the UK/Ireland. I've had a perusal of the subs rules and guidelines and I think [hope] this will be fine.

I suffer from a chronic pain condition that is in a 'permanent' flare-up state due to breaking my back when I was 21. According to my doctor, this forces my brain to shove me into a disassociated state to try and gain a 'break/rest'. I'm fine with the pain aspect.

But I would really, really, appreciate any help you guys can give to try and help with disassociation. I can't cope with it. I have no memory, I have no wants or desires, I just 'exist' but I don't know who it is that is existing. I am struggling to even detail this post because unless I'm 'me' again and in full cognitive faculties (which is happening less and less), I can't actually know/understand what the full extent is.

I guess right now all I'm able to verbalise is that I would really appreciate any helpful tips/tricks/mechanisims/habits that would help me actually live my life, and not 'wake up' every couple of weeks and be in an emotional black depressive hole where I feel like I'm dying, and then go back to watching my life pass by in blank confusion.

I have 2 half-brothers on my dad’s side that are all 10+ years older than me, who have never been a big part of my life. 
As a teenager, my mental health was a hot mess. I had undiagnosed autism and a whole lot of trauma. My extended family was never involved or even really aware of all the psych wards I was put in/ all the pain I was in. My parents were very old fashioned about not talking about mental health with anyone. I wasn’t even allowed to call myself depressed. 
When I was a bit older, the one brother (referred to as B) and his family moved closer to where I lived and I saw them more often. By then, I had already moved out, become a lot healthier, was getting the correct therapy, was properly diagnosed ect. I was/ am pretty happy and stable now. 

My niece was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD when she was 7. B and his wife (let’s call her SIL) have always been incredibly supportive. She goes to a smaller, private school, has a tutor + extra lessons, has seen a a psychologist for years, and they’re incredibly kind and gentle with her. 
She’s 13 now and, with lockdown knocking her anxiety sideways, she has become severely anorexic. I could barely recognize her when I saw her after 4 months. 

Although food was an issue for me with autism, it never got to the point she’s now at. However, I am one of the only people she is willing to spend time with (think she sees me as a ‘cool aunt’?) 

I saw her today and just told her she can always call me and she can talk to me about whatever she needs when she’s ready. Everyone in our family is trying to give her advice and I think it’s making it worse, so I told her I won’t do that. I’d just be there for her. We made art and watched the office and talked shit. She laughed and seemed okay. 
But when I dropped her off, her maternal grandmother started saying she is going to have a ‘serious chat’ with niece and it set off alarm bells in my head. 

I don’t know 1) what I can do to help other than reminding her that I’m here for her [which I needed someone to tell me when I was 13] and 2) how to tell B and SIL to tell everyone to back off. She has a psych + good parents + a best friend + now me, who I guess she trusts just to hold space. But think everyone else trying to help is making it worse? 

TL/ DR: my niece is really struggling with anorexia and trusts me because I’m the ‘cool aunt’ who doesn’t make a big deal about it. Any advice on how to help her, and any advice on how to tell extended family to back off?",05Sep2020,1

   I am the eldest child of our family (F, 40) with a younger sister (F, 38) and brother (M, 37). We live in different places now since we moved out after college but still maintain to contact each other through the years. 

   Now a month earlier the present day, expecting my second child, my old friend had to call me from the Philippines and told me that my sister was tested positive for COVID-19, and was admitted to the hospital, together with her husband and my brother.

   I was unable to react at first from disbelief, that feeling of dread filled up and clouded my thoughts; I couldn't possibly go back home, it's too risky at times like these. Although I can't bear having just to stay here and do nothing. 

   I was very stressed and experienced insomnia, my husband was so worried about me and our baby that he took a leave from online work just to take care of me and our daughter. 

     Then the news came.

   All three of them died days apart from complications with COVID-19, and was quickly cremated after their deaths. 

   And now, as I'm tearing up writing this down, How could you even have the power to cope and accept about when all of your siblings died before you? For me it's just so unnatural and that feeling of emptiness that in a matter of a short time, you've just became the only living relative alive from your generation?

Even more so as I child. 
I was loud, rude, obnoxious
And, no, not everyone is. 
I've been told. 
It's ok. I get it.

I wasnt particularly good at sports
Cricket, maybe, but even then 
I struggled to do anything useful for
A team. I even gave one of my own batsmen out once, as an umpire. Correctly, but that's not important.
The chairman demanded that the objectionable 17 year old be removed from the field for doing my job correctly.
It's ok. I get it.

I picked up a few facts and
Tidbits of general knowledge over the years.
Everyone does, it's nothing special.
And I annoy everyone by getting quiz questions correct and 'deliberately' making them feel stupid.
Not knowing stuff gets you laughed at, by some, but knowing stuff gets you hated.
It's ok. I get it.

I have some amount of talent in some things. I can act, apparently. I've never noticed. 
I can write, too, or so they say, but neither of these are 'real jobs' and I've been told quite recent that they will never make me enough money to support my family.
It's ok. I get it.

I get tired after doing stuff. Not always a lot of stuff, but I get tired. I cant help it. 
I used to smoke so maybe I'm unfit. That one is actually my fault, but despite not having a cigarette in 36 months, I apparently only 'porperly' gave it up a week ago. So I guess vaping at 0-3mg means no other effort counts for literally anything.
I dont drink anymore though.

I have ""mental health"". No, that's not a slur. Other people have actual mental health. I have ""mental health"" because it gets in the way. Of other people, not of me. I'm ok with it.
When I had a really down time a couple of years ago, my old boss made fun of me (in front of the entire team) because all I had achieved that weekend was rearranging my room. Someone else had been fortunate enough to save a life.
So it's right that I was humiliated in front of my peers.

It's ok. I get it.

I also know that writing something like
This is, largely, self centred, unfair,

But all it does is make it seem like I think
All of my problems are the only problems
In the world.
Which they aren't. I know they aren't. 
Its ok. I get it.

But by God it would be nice if just
Every now and then people also realised
That THEIR problems aren't the only
Problems in the world.
We are all suffering and struggling in 
Our own ways, in our own situations.
No-one is perfectly happy all of the time.
It's ok. I get it.

I'm better than when I started writing
This. So, I guess that's good. I still feel
Shitty though. And I'm honestly not sure
When I won't feel shitty. Because I have
To step back into new problems,
Like everyone else,
And I'm sure there will be new verses
To this added over time.
But, for now, since I have very little
Other choice.

It's ok. I got this.",05Sep2020,1
118,"Hi,  


I've recently been having trouble regarding something I've begun remembering a few months ago. It's always been a weird memory for me, the part that I've always remembered. It was something my parents joked about after we moved into a new neighbourhood when I was very young. I estimate I was around 5-6 at the time.   


""We met Mr. Neighbour (censoring name), and he asked if he could take you on a ride on his 4-wheeler. We said yes, but just to the end of the road. He took you to a country club to feed fish, though.""  


That was all I was told. Again, they treated it like a joke. But I never really thought of it, not ever. I knew I used to go to his house too, sometimes alone, which I can't remember much of either. I remember going over to hang out with his granddaughter/niece/unsure of her relation, and we were friends. But other than that, and going to pick blueberries in his backyard, it's all a blur.   


A year ago, I was sexually assaulted. I'm 19 now and had just turned 18. The woman was on drugs, called me a girl and harassed me and my boss (I'm a transman), and touched me sexually, also implicating with her words that she thought I was a child. It took me months to accept with the help of my therapist that I was actually sexually assaulted.   


I know I am a victim of grooming at age 15, though the farthest this man got was asking me out; he is in jail now for CSEM and statutory rape. And I know when I was around 12, a woman tried to get me to leave a store with her. However, I began to get a lot of nightmares about sexual assault and rape semi-recently. I have OSDD-1B as well, undiagnosed, but with all of this happening in the world, I haven't gotten a chance to see my therapist to finally admit it to her.   


And then I remembered the 'joke', the story my parents told me. And it was no longer so innocent. See it from my perspective as I look back on it as an adult, one who has PTSD, dissociative disorders, etc. and can recognise trauma now: I meet a stranger. I get on a vehicle with him.  


He takes me into the woods near our house. I can't remember anything. And then I'm on a pier with him. What are we feeding fishes with? There isn't a country club near our house. It was in someone's backyard. He was talking to me but I don't know what was said. I don't know when or how I got home.   


I never felt safe around him, when I think of it. I'm autistic as well, and I don't like strangers, but it felt different. I think I believed in my parents, that Mr. N was a good guy. He was an elderly man, and in my parent's eyes, they do no wrong (I have a recent situation that occurred w/ one of their church members, but I'll spare you. He was just creepy and they excused it).   


Not long after this, I began to become extremely sexual to the point of masturbating 5+ times a day. I tried to get my 'boyfriends' to kiss me and have sex with me. I did sexual things with my best friend, who was a girl. I literally would masturbate IN class. In youth group. Every. Single. Day. But...how did I know what it was? Why did I try sneaking peeks at Cosmoplitians' sexual pages? Why did I insist for years to sleep with my parents? Why did I develop OSDD-1B (other than other private reasons)? Why did I have the mindset that I was so mature, that if ANYONE asked to have sex with me, I know I would have said yes? 

I think my neighbour molested me. I don't remember anything. I know I shouldn't remember. I know I have OSDD-1B to not remember. But yet, I am. And I'm scared. I'm so fucking scared. This neighbour passed when I was still in elementary school. I'm afraid, however, that I'm disgracing the dead if this did not happen to me. But it feels like I'm right. It would explain everything.  


I will be addressing this with my therapist soon. Please, however, lend me your thoughts.",05Sep2020,1
120,"I’ve recently gone through increasingly bad mental health spurt, I got diagnosed with BPD and am currently dealing with psychosis - I hear voices fairly frequently but I’m on medication which helps. Also have very bad anxiety. 

The last thing I remember last night was hearing really really bad voices, at around 1:10am I sent a tweet on my private twitter saying ‘voices are increasingly bad tonight, I want this to stop, I’m going to go to sleep now, I hope it stops’ and I remember going to sleep after that, I don’t remember waking up and I fell asleep very quickly from what I remember. I even put my phone on my night stand. 

I woke up to a bunch of missed calls from my friend and I realised I’d send a message at 1:45am saying ‘I’m sad’ and ‘scars’ which is super weird. I don’t remember sending this at all, I have however struggled with self harm since I was 12 years old. The fact I don’t remember and that this ties into that just made me even more concerned considering I would have had to unlock my phone and go onto his messages to even be able to send that in the first place.

Has anyone experienced something like this? I’m seriously trying to make sense of it. It can’t have just been like I left my phone unlocked bc my phone unlocks every minute and that’s way too specific for me to have just accidentally typed it. Plus I put my phone on my night stand. I’m super confused, someone help me make sense of this?",05Sep2020,1
121,"We see injustice around us every day; discrimination, bullying and exploitation are commonplace. We have a responsibility to use our voice to highlight injustice and reduce the suffering of others. But in shining a light we can speak out of anger - we're often told we should be angry or to ""get angry"". We should acknowledge our anger, listen and accept it, but acting directly on anger (even when we believe we're right) can escalate hate and violence. Speaking from peace can make our words heard, more powerful and ultimately have more impact in the world.

I don’t think she had depression because she told me she always felt this way (she used to tell her parents as a kid that she was a bit mad at them for giving her life..). This makes me sad and distressed sometimes, I hate knowing that my mom isn’t pleased with life. It also makes me feel pressured because I want to do my best to make her happy but I always feel at fault when she isn’t. it’s all a bit depressing really, also knowing that her dad committed suicide..

My mental health has been declining for the past four months waiting for him because I’m scared his family is going to hurt or kill him but he won’t do anything till you and I just want him to be safe and I just want to be happy

126,"I can’t describe how mentally exhausted I feel with myself. My anxiety, overthinking and worrying is killing me. I don’t even know who I am anymore or what my purpose is, I just feel like my entire life is run by these intrusive and overpowering thoughts, and so many of them are pointless and irrelevant. 

I’m not living my life, I’m 20, with a steady job, a caring family and a loving boyfriend, I have nothing to complain about but I can’t seem to bring myself out of this dark hole. I pretend everything is fine to my family and try put on a brave face most of the time to my boyfriend. But when I’m alone I just feel lost and so empty, I don’t own my life anymore, it feels lost to these thoughts. 

I’m scared to be happy because I know it doesn’t last too long before some controlling thought runs anxiety through me. It feels like my mind is purposely on the look out to find something for me to overthink or panic about, no matter how hard I try to stop it.

It doesn’t feel like it’s getting any better, I feel awful all the time, and it just feels like it’s never going to stop. I can’t describe how much I want it to go away

Recently a few very close friends of mine and myself went through something horrific, especially just one of my friends, I can’t help but think of what it would be like if that happened to me. It just makes me feel selfish because it’s as if my brain is trying to say make me say “look at me, I went through something worse,” when I’d never ever want to flaunt that if I even thought it was true.

I don’t know what I apparently did though, I can’t think of anything, or why I’d want to do something mean. It’s always things I think I did with ill intentions too, it feels unlike me.

130,"I used to be outgoing, active. Decisive. These days I find myself questioning everything I do, I feel down, sad, angry.

I've been seeing a neurologist who diagnosed me with bipolar, but I really don't think I am, I feel like she stretched things to fit. I was put on lithium which made me fat, more depressed, I lost my creativity, my drive. I took that for 6 months before I stopped, against her advice. But I feel a little better in one way, and worse in others.

My main problem is that I'm sick and tired of fighting fires I didn't light.  My life feels like a struggle, I work, I come home, I'm tired, I soend a lot of time fighting charges from a bank or an insurance company, or calling up one of the tradesmen that didn't do their job properly to come put it right, I have lots of problems with my internet that my provider can't or won't fix so I'm allways fighting with them.  Then there are the occasions when I'm outright lied to by companies about the service they offer, such as O2, and now I'm in a legal battle to get out of my contract that is costing me money. this feels like my life for the last 20 years. Constantly having to fight to simply have what I'm legitimately entitled to.

I think it's normal that this would make me angry, frustrated.  I talk to friends and they say I need to stop letting this stuff get to me, or I'm being negative, or it's not that bad, look at all the companies that you don't have these problems with... 

This is my problem. I've seen an analogy I cannot unsee.  I'm the victim of various small transgressions by companies or organizations, most of us are, they don't happen by accident, and it's not right. If you scale it up a little or a lot, thd principle applies. Someone is being wronged by soneone else for their gain, like a mugging. But you would never dream of telling the victim of a violent mugging to think of all the times people didn't mug them. And what is more, the amounts of money I lose every year ftom this kind of thing us far higher then any amount ever lost to a mugging, and clearly has also had more of a mental impact on me. 

People are ripping me off. Stealing from me, lying to me, to all of us actually...  Yet I'm the one who needs to be on meds, I'm the one with sonething wrong. 

The problem is compounded by the fact that so many people just don't see it, they don't see any of this as a problem, which makes it easier for this shit to happen. 

Then this spreads over to work, my rich as fuck CEO boss turning up to work in a helicopter, but we can't possibly have a pay raise.  The amount of money he wants to make decides the salary the rest of us get, decides our standard of living, our class, what possible reach we have on life. And why? Because he worked hard? Or because he took over his father's  company and got lucky with the internet boom? 

I'm just sick of getting shit on from a great hight, and sicker from looking around at everyone else looking to the skies with their mouths wide open. 

I've been in the medical system for a year now, and I feel worse, no one has really done me much good and I constantly feel like I'm being rushed so they can get to the next person, I've been passed around, it's costing my health insurance a bomb, but it's not benefitting me at all, just the doctors getting paid. More of the same shit. 

What is this? 

I'm really struggling to feel calm, I'm always anxious or on edge I bob my legs like crazy, I can't sleep properly. I'm making my family miserable but I can't help myself.

131,"Lately I've been getting more worried about my friend. She didn't have a very good start into the year: a few mental breakdowns and a failed suicide attempt.. I think she is doing a bit better than before but she is still in a very bad place and I just don't know how to help her.

A few months ago she actually stayed at a clinic for about a week and she finally opened up about her struggles, but not in much detail. She's slowly and steadily getting to a place where she can talk about her mental health with me and her other friends.

I'm just trying to be there for her even though I'm very depressed myself. But I feel like no matter what I do, it won't change anything in the long run.
My advice is straight up ignored and all the positive things I tell her are forgotten, her mindset is just too negative. And I know that it's not her fault at all.
But it's just so discouraging to witness all the progress she makes be nullified immediately after.
And I feel so selfish for saying this since our other friends are so supportive and always seem so positive. I don't have the courage to bring up my worries because it would make me seem like I don't understand.

Seeing the scars on her arms, hearing her hyperventilating and seeing her teary eyes just hurts me so much. But how can I bring that up without overstepping boundaries?

Another thing is, she has a huge crush on her co-worker who is 10 years older than her. She gets so excited over basic human interactions and tells us all about it. The thing is, that age gap is very significant since we are in our teens.
My friend seems to be really emotional at the moment. She feels like she doesn't have a chance with her co-worker but at the same time she can't stop thinking about her and probably won't give up. But she won't ask her out either, which is very understandable.
I don't know whether I should get her hopes up or tell her to give it up. Both options would end up hurting her.

A lot of it I can’t make out, but sometimes it’s audio from things like video games I’ve played a lot that day or a movie I’ve watched. Sometimes the voices are very distorted or just random words, but sometimes the sentences almost make sense or make sense if the context has nothing to do with me. Like one sentence could be “did you water them?” I have no idea what that is referring to. Another sentence could be “the mouse trap really ate all the schools paper, didn’t I?” It doesn’t make sense but it’s almost a regular sentence, it’s not like “plant bark going places,” which is just a jumble of words. Sometimes I’ll hear screams, scary noises, random noises, etc. Those only tend to happen more when I’m stressed out though. They’re sometimes hard to “hear” with all the other voices in my head and I very very very very very rarely hear a voice in my head that sounds like it came from outside my head and is extremely clear. I know this has happened more than once but I only remember one instance where I heard a boy yell in my head, “do you need help?” And I jolted uptight. I was trying to sleep at the time. It hear it more when I’m trying to sleep or when I first wake up and it drives me crazy because it’s this constant noise and I can’t fall back asleep always because of it.

134,"Warning: I will be vaguely discussing toxic situations and painful experiences. If you want to skip these, you can start by the 4th paragraph. I’m sorry if I sound so disoriented I am really in pain and I need help. 
I’m not asking for resources in my region; I know a lot of them but due to the pandemic they are booked. Besides, talking about toxic parents is taboo in my country. 

[TLDR: My parents do not love me, and it is a hard pill to swallow time and time again. Despite this, I want to come into terms with it so I can live better and stop feeling this immense pain. Please help, what can I do about it?]

I need help. I have been struggling time and time again because of two horrible people — my boomer parents. I often find myself praying to God to take me so my suffering could end. I often idealize self harm because I do not want to be in this house anymore with them. 

I love them but they don’t love me. They would often get my (22) name wrong with my older sister (32) and often hang out with her than me (we live in the same house). They waited till I was in my 20s, graduated from college, before they would give me my own space in the house THAT IS if I had not fought for it. They don’t tell me anything regarding the house, or even talk to me about my life. They will just dictate what I should do with it. When I confessed my mental problems they keep dismissing me. 

I am a good student; I passed on the top uni in my country and I’m on my way to law, as per their wishes. At first I was really against law because it was being forced on me. But then I worked hard to pass that exam to get in so I could use law to get me out of my situation — so I could live peacefully on my own. But then this pandemic hit and law is about to start and I’m still in this house. I cannot take it anymore. 

I am feeling this intense abhorrence towards them: for giving me life when they will just neglect me, or force me to do things in my life; for never being there; for never listening and respecting how I feel; and a lot more. 

My chest hurts so bad while I’m crying because that’s how much pain and suffering I’m experiencing. It’s such a hard thing to talk about because people often think they should love their parents. But I’m having a hard time fully loving them because I know by their actions and their words that they do not love me. I am just a waste of life brought onto them when they were in their 40s.

I want to tell them how bad of a parent — of a person they are. I keep hoping that they see how badly they have treated me. Now I am forever damned to be alone because of them. I can’t get friends or significant others because of the damage they did to me.

Nonetheless, I am hopeful that I can get through this but I would like to accept it first. So I am humbly asking if anyone knows ways or coping mechanisms to get through this damage and hatred? Please.",05Sep2020,1

- To that one soul reading this, I know you’re tired, you’re fed up, you’re so close to breaking but there’s strength within you even when you feel weak. Keep fighting.
- My dark days made me stronger. Or, maybe I already was strong, and they made me prove it. 
- It’s okay to not be perfect, it’s okay to make mistakes, it’s okay to do something that you hadn’t done, because if we don’t do those things, we never grow. 
- And if today, all you did was hold yourself together, I’m proud of you. 
- You’ll have good days, you’ll have bad days, overwhelming days, tired days, I can’t go on days, I’m awesome days. And everyday you’ll still show up.
- Isn’t that brave of you, to silence the voice inside your head, that yells and doubts your worth.
- Choose, everyday to forgive yourself. You are human, flawed and most of all, worthy of love.

141,"I think most of the people here struggle with the 'what if my friends secretly hate me' thoughts. Well, I guess you know where this is going.  
 About a year ago my life turned for the worse. I don't want to get into details but let's just say that in the span of a year I got broken up with after a serious relationship, all my friends slowly left me and also told me that they actually didn't want to be friends with me for about two years now and that they just stayed around because they felt sorry for me, the one person out of that group that didn't betray me is still friends with them as well and I really don't want to talk to him anymore because it reminds me of them but I'd feel bad if I pushed away the one person that stayed. I was left with the total of three friends, but one of them is the one I don't really want to talk to after everything that happened, the other one is in love with me and turned full on nice guy mode on me and is pushing me into a relationship after I've told him that I'm not interested several times and the last one has been my best friend the whole time, so I guess I'm left with one true friend but I don't want to push him away too by being overwhelming. 

That's not all that happened, there's more but I don't want to get into it all. But after all that happened in this last year I just can't bring myself to trust people, to trust anyone except for that one friend who's always been there for me. I'm alone and sometimes I feel lonely but then I push people away and I wanna be left alone but at the same time I need someone to be my friend, someone to talk to.

I don't even know what this all about. I'm so hurt that the people who I've considered best friends weren't actually my friends at all. I feel like I can't trust anyone after this. I can't bring myself to feel anything, I'm just emotionally numb and empty and... I just don't know what to do.  All I really want is someone to hug me and let me cry in silence.

143,"I've had sleeping problems my entire life, and also very terrible depression. 

When I was kid, I had a fear of dying in my sleep so I never slept. I would be up until 3AM everyday, go to school, and just run on like 3 hours of sleep each night.

While I outgrew that fear, I still as a young adult fight my sleep- just out of habit.

I have a feeling this is where a lot of my mental turmoil is coming from. I recently had a week during which I slept normally- and I felt normal for the first time in so long. I was able to make decisions, avoid mental breakdowns, didn't feel a huge sense of despair. 

But that lasted a week and now I'm back on my bs. I won't even let myself nap or sleep in because I feel I'm not being productive. I just push through. Go to bed at 3, wake up at 6 and go about my whole day.

I don't know how to fix it. I have begun taking melatonin, but I even fight that. I will get so drowsy and just won't let myself sleep. 

Wish I knew how to fix this problem. I want to heal and feel normal again.",05Sep2020,1

145," I'm exhausted. My psychologist told me that I have ADD and I honestly don't know if that's what's making my life so difficult or if I'm being dramatic and using it as an excuse for problems that I cause for myself. I'm late for school almost every day (three minutes or so every time) because I lose track of time when I'm getting ready, no matter how early I wake up. I also procrastinate a lot and right now I should be doing my Finnish assignment but I haven't even started. I feel like I don't have any free time because I think about my school assignments all the time but can't bring myself to actually do them until the last minute. During the school week I only sleep for about an hour every night because once again, I don't know how to start getting ready for bed until it's 4:30 AM.

146,"   Nothing makes sense, ***I*** don't make sense. I mean, really. The more I think about it the weirder and fucked it gets. I don't even know when it all started, probably when I was around 9 years old, which is like 7 years ago considering I'm turning 16 this year. That time I used to think that mental illness was cool. I mean, not that kind of cool, but as in ""people with mental illness is so admirable and cute, I wish they suffer forever so I can keep watching and fantasize about them"" or smth. It's creepy, yeah, and I liked being creepy. I was pretty sadistic and insensitive back then. I'd only read, watch, and stuff if the main character in said story were to suffer. That includes gore videos and photos I found online. I thought to myself ""damn, I'm so fcked up."" And honestly I thought it all would stop there, but no. I didn't realize it back then, but overtime, I've slowly became jealous. Although I didn't want to admit it, I wanted to be like them. I wanted to have it, to have an illness.

   Then I turned 12, which is like the peak of chaos for most people, or me atleast. I started becoming more and more obsessed with this whole ""I want to become ill"" thingy. I'd spend my free time to read about psychology stuff and fantasize having them. I'd purposefully fuck myself over then pretend that I have problems (eg : intentionally making shameful mistakes in front of the whole class, then forcing myself to think about it again and again until I couldn't even sleep, or intentionally and impulsively cutting off friends from my life so I don't have anyone to share problems with). I had even almost committed murder, just so that I could feel the guilt of killing my own best friend and blame myself over it. Point is, it was a bad time, and unfortunately, it might have worked. I said ""might"", because, the worst part of all this shit is, It's gotten so out of hand that I couldn't even tell if I'm pretending or if I do actually have problems anymore. I don't know if I actually really want to die or if I wanted to feel like I want to die, I don't know if I really do feel anxious and panicky or if I'm just pretending to be anxious, and stuff. I really can't but doubt myself. ""Am I really sick, or am I just a bitch who wanted to burn in hell for my own amusement?"".

   It's addicting. Hurting myself and breaking myself down is addicting. I wish for nothing but to get broken and sent to hell for eternity. I don't know why, but it's just like that. It hurts, I want to scream, I want to cry, but that's it. I don't want to be helped. I told my problems to people and seeing their worry, saddened face drives me crazy, it makes me feel even more guilty and suicidal, but when they tried to help me, I look away and pretended I never heard that. I showed and told my parents about my suicide attempt, and their saddened worried face makes me sick to the bottom of my stomach, but I just want more. I want more of it, more of that guilt. I kept telling myself, ""this people are liars! they will manipulate you, and your life is fucked, and you can't do anything about it."" even though I know damn well that everyone's just trying to help. I don't know, I just liked seeing myself suffer more and more. It's unbearable enough already, but I still want to suffer even more. I really can't wait and am looking forward to how much more pain will I experience in the future. I hate it, I hate everything about this, I just want everything to stop, but I kept doing it, and I'm at loss for words, because nothing makes sense anymore. Do I want to suffer or not? I don't fucking know. It doesn't make any fucking sense, goddamnit.

I feel so much love towards all the people posting today and I truly feel empathy and sympathy for all of you. I just might be in a kick-ass mood because (and please don't take this as bragging) but we had gotten so much food stamp money this month that we actually bought filet mignon for us. This is such a rare occurrence that I was excited all the way home from the supermarket! I have only had filet mignon a handful of times at restaurants...never made it at home. So wish me luck lol. Thank goodness for Chef Ramsay! I had to look up how he makes it so I would know. Heh.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, that is not the point of this post. I just feel so danged happy today for some odd reason. Maybe it is also because the sun is shining and it is just warm enough to wear shorts. Fall is coming here, and coming fast. The leaves are already showing signs of changing and Halloween stuff is already out in the stores. We just moved to a new area, so I am excited to go Halloweening with our youngest, which I haven't done for years because it was just too strenuous for me. I have severe anemia, which means I don't have enough iron in my blood to properly carry oxygen to my body, which, in turn, means that I get exhausted and out of breath very easily. I can't walk much, and even a trip to the supermarket is a challenge a lot of the time. :( I feel good and strong today though, and, even though I don't normally eat red meat, I am looking forward to having the steak and potatoes and a veggie (we have corn on the cob!!) tonight. The meat will boost my iron again. :)

Its name is Nanners (it is yellow and a bit of brownish-gray) and believe it or not, I have it hand-tamed already after one day! It kind of flew into the fly-paper trap thing and I had to bathe it gently with vegetable oil and then mild soap (looked it up) and then I kept it warm and calm for a while before letting it go back with its cage-mates. It is acting perfectly normal now and is eating and drinking and pooping fine. Whew.

160,"So, rn I am 28.  
Finished highschool and decidaded to take some time to enjoy life. Ended up spending 2 or 3 years doing drugs and going to raves every chance I got. Finally decided to get a job at a factory, very stressful, started having a anxiety problem where I would constantly feel the URGE to pee. Go to doctor, prescribed anti-stress medicadition and 2 weeks of work to see how I would react. Still was in trial period at the factory and got fired. 1 or 2 years later decided to go take a 2 year course at a university in my small city. Final semester was an intership. Started to have this kind of attacks where I couldn't concentrate, barely read and barely talk, where thoughts would repeat endlessly in my mind. Go to doctor ""don't pay attention to them, you don't have anything"". Go to terapist, 2 years go by and the ""attacks"" are more frequent and much more intense. One day I wake up and intantly get one, to the point that I ask my mother for help to go to the hospital. Undress my sleeping clothes and then was unable to think what to do next (how to pick up clothes and dress myself). Finally dessed, I go to the hospital with my mother. When I get to the doctors office I can't talk at all, so my mother tries to explain as best as she could what was going on with me. Get diagnosed with paranoia and thought echo/rumination, both part of schizophrenia. Start to take 8 pills a day to try and control it. To this day I still have this ""attacks"", some times they are easyer to deal with and I can still do simple stuff, some times they hit me so hard that I think of suicide. During the last few years I had a couple of jobs, but none longer than 2 weeks. My grandfather only became aware of this condition of mine recently and told my mother that maybe I would qualify to welfare for maybe being considered work invalid. The monthly welfare for invalids depends on a number of factors, and is almost always less than minimum wage. But being unemployed, or having a job for 2 week in god knows how long is worse than receiving less than minimum wage, atleast I would have my own money for my stuff instead of being totally dependent on my mother for everything.

165,"Hey guys,  
Another redditor suggested I post this here, so here we go.  
I'm not entirely sure how to word this because it's such a bizarre thing that I don't fully understand it myself.  
I've had this thing throughout my life when someone makes a noise, touches me in a certain way, etc. and I instantly get this sensation, a sort of tension like feeling all over my body, me mind catches on fire and I either want to scream, or cry, or just fucking destroy something to alleviate 'the pain'. Let me elaborate.  
My husband often comes to my desk when I'm working and massages my shoulders a little because I deal with pain a lot. Then other times, he comes up to me, puts his hand on my shoulder, gently squeezes me shoulder, like BARELY and stops. And my mind is FUCKED. I'm seeing red. I'm ready to kill. I'm in physical pain and mental pain. I want to scream. This lasts for hours, I can't concentrate, it absolutely fucks me up.  
Some nights he gives me a kiss before going to bed if I'm staying up late. He does this thing where his lips barely touch mine and wow, again, I'm fucked. The sensation of the skin barely touching is so triggering, I'm almost crying just thinking about it.  
Same thing with my mother. This used to be a problem when I was much younger and living with my parents. At mealtime, she would do these weird mouth noises and I would lose it.  
Often times I would start crying and clench my fists so hard my nails broke the skin and I bled. It would ruin my day, I absolutely couldn't think of anything else for hours, it interfered with my ability to concentrate in school.

Or my brother used to have this stupid habit when he was little, he would repeat a word again and again ALL DAY. Even several days. This would set me off so bad that I would get physical.

I'm trying my absolute best to recover but I know things like this take time. 
I have taken the biggest step I think I can take, which is to forgive my father for what he did to me and my family. As I've spoken to many people he was most likely mentally ill as well but since he was very narcissistic he would not take any advice from anyone.
I have stopped all contact with him years ago, but as I reflect I think something was wrong with him that I could not fix and that what happened was not my fault (it took my a very long time to come to terms with this). 
But with forgiving comes forgetting..
And well my PTSD makes that very, very hard. 
I am constantly scared of noises, soft or loud. I get startled really easily. Nightmares every single time I sleep, even if it's an hour nap. I dissociate constantly and miss moments in the day. Paranoia every time I leave the house even if I'm just on my front porch or checking the mailbox..

I'm a man 29. This keeps happening some times for some reason, and even if i know it might not be something bad, but still, it completely freaks me out.  
It is a strange feeling, all of a sudden i start to feel a bit nervous for some reason, like ''i sense something'' and then anything that happens makes it worse, i sometimes feel like ''OMG im gonna collapse now'' or like i'm loosing breath, my head feels dizzy,  my heart starts to race and most of times my palms start sweating, or also my forehead, not much, but just so that is it there. I start to feel like ''aware'' of everything around me and in me, its really scary. Anything gets me off guard.  It gets to that point that i don't know how to calm, don't know how to stand or sit or focus on staying ''normal''.  
Ok, this might be weird, but sometimes it happens after i drink coffe? Or its just random? Weird.  
I would really like to get an answer from someone who has same/simillar experiance.   
Please help if you can. I would really like some solution to this. :(",05Sep2020,1

181,"Imagine, being 25 years old, in a big family where only one of your family members is a consistently toxic person.
That’s the case with me and my family. Ever since I can remember I was never happy in my childhood, my parents worked a lot so we didn’t really get to spend time with them unless we were on holiday in Florida, US. Even when we were there, there was always some kind of argument going on about something trivial. 
I was in the hospital a lot when I was a child because of my health conditions. I had heart surgery and was diagnosed with asthma from a very young age, too young to remember so I only remember being in hospital all the time. From a young age I was never happy being left to one of my sisters who we will name as D. D was never nice to us, we were always looking over our shoulders in case D would attack, either verbally or physically with us, especially towards myself and my younger sister, A. D would always shout at us for the smallest of things, she would smack, push and pinch us if she was angry at something, we were always the target for her. I remember being age 12 or possibly younger, D had run away, left me and my youngest sister A alone one the home and we awoke to find that we were alone, D had escaped through a window and we had no idea where D had gone. Me and A were worried so we called our mum, who then had to leave work, and call the police to help search for D, this happened more than once. There was another occasion where D had her friend round and drank the entire liquor cabinet and had vomited endlessly, woke me and A up through the night, and forcing me and A to clean up, A wasn’t even 10 years old yet, D was about 16/17 I believe at the time. If we ever refused to do anything D would shout at us or hurt us in some way so we had no choice. We were always bullied by D. This type of bullying and abuse carried on even more so after my father passed away when I was 14, a high school kid, already being bullied by my classmates and then got it when I got home from my sister, D. I don’t have a happy memory with D, she was never there or she was out drinking all the time. Refused to do anything and used us as slaves. Forced us to clean up her messes even when we got back from school. When I say me and A, it was only us that got the worst treatment from D because we were the youngest. D’s treatment of us has had a nasty and negative impact on my mental health to the point I don’t have a lot of trust for people, I don’t have a lot of friends and I’m quite reserved most of the time. I was abused by a friend of the family when I was 8 years old and I put that to the back of my head, only for the memory and the trauma to resurface when I was 24 years old when I saw something that triggered that memory to return, I was also sexually assaulted at work on shift last November 2019 and I never got offered help for my trauma. I have battled prescription drug addiction for the last remaining years of my teenage years, from age 17 to somewhere in my early 20s and I have been sober for 3+ years. I don’t remember the exact date I went sober. I used drugs to suppress my emotions and I tried to numb whatever it was that needed numbing. When I was 15 I was sexually abused and I never trusted anyone until I met my husband, and we’ve been together for 8 years. I have depression, anxiety and generalised anxiety disorder. All of which stem from the abuse myself and my sister A suffered at the hands of D, my trauma from when I was 8 years old, the loss of my father at age 14 and the drug addiction road I was on at age 17 after I attempted suicide at age 14, age 18 and age 24. In terms of D, we have never had a good sisterly relationship because she has never taken accountability for her actions to me and my sister, A. She has caused chaos in my family and battled my mum into oblivion by blaming her for her own issues and how my mum was horrible. D has always sought out men to make her happy. She got married and divorced before she’s 30, she’s 28. D has a habit of disappearing for months on end but will call my mother to pick her up when she’s been dumped by a man we’ve never met or if we did, he’s gone within a few months to a year. When D is back in our lives, there is always some kind of drama that occurs and the same outcome will always the same: D blames my mum for her issues. And D will go away again and we won’t hear anything from D unless she’s got a new boyfriend, will meet the new man and that’ll be it until the next storm arrives and D is back again. Whenever I’ve tried to help D, it’s the same thing- “mum said this, mum said that blah blah blah” and she won’t listen to me. The amount of time myself and the rest of my sisters have had to deal with D and her issues is unreal. “D is back at mums again, D is with a new guy, D is back at mums again and D has left again and left all her stuff once again. D has said this about you and D thinks this about you” and the list goes on. I wrote an 18 page letter (FRONT AND BACK) to D detailing and telling her about the abuse and bullying she put me and my sister A through, all the arguments and the way D treats my mum and how D needs to get some help, take accountability for her actions.... she hasn’t and she continues to be a problem in this family. I have disowned her completely because it’s everyone else’s problem, not hers according to her anyway. I let D stay with me and my husband only for her to bring her drama to my house, big mistake. She stayed my sisters house, never paid rent and was going between men like it was a pass the parcel at Christmas time, she threatened to call social services (cps) on my sister a few weeks/months after giving birth to her child because D is dramatic and will do anything for attention because she’s a bully. My niece is absolutely amazing, very smart and is loved incredibly by us and her mum. D has faked miscarriages on more than one occasion and is apparently pregnant now but is currently out going to different bars drinking.... if you’re pregnant, stay away from the alcohol. The last time I told D to go back on her antidepressant medication, she does and then goes off them again, because you can’t drink alcohol with antidepressants, alcohol is a depressant.... D has never had a place of her own, she sponges off of men who have no idea who she is until she blows up, verbally abuses them and she either leaves them or they dump her when they figure out what she’s like. This is what happens when D brings her drama back to our family, she’ll blame my mum when she’s called out on her problems and D will flip it onto either me, my mum or someone else in my family. Most recently, as of yesterday, September 4th 2020 I got a message from D asking me to be there for her, before I get a chance to respond she’s blocked me, she’s sent the most disgusting messages to my mother as usual and to my sister, A. I responded to D through my mums phone as D is blocked on mine now, she has no way of contacting me. I told her the truth, she uses people, she only contacts you when drama is happening and she won’t contact you again unless she wants something. That’s the way it’s always been. I don’t know who she is anymore and I don’t care. This is just my way of venting and hoping someone else can relate to me on some level if they have this problem with a sibling.... I have gone through years of therapy to help get myself back on my feet. I have a mental health professional and the support system I need. There is so much more that D has done to me but we will never get off of this app. I hope that whoever reads this, you’re okay and you’re not alone.",05Sep2020,1

192,"Worried about the way I think? Dissociation?

Hey, I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this; 

Recently me and a flatmate of mine have come across videos online talking about D.I.D ( Dissociative identity disorder) and after discussion with my flatmate about it all, we got onto the topic of internal voice or so and at this point I already knew that I can't really picture things in my mind, I can sort of see like vauge shapes and very faintly colours but picturing something mentally doesn't really work for me. But then I sort of realised that I don't think I really have an internal voice either. It's hard to describe but my thoughts feel like forced? And as if they take active effort to sort of conceptualise? There's no version of my voice in my head sort off doing things, it just sort of happens? 

It's really frustrating and vauge to explain and to try and describe it and ever since thinking about it, I have sort of felt Dissociated from my body to some slight extent, like detached and not totally their with my extremities feeling strange. 


I was really wondering if this is normal or should I seek help from someone or if anyone at all has anything like this, it scares me quite a bit thinking about it, frequently getting my upset for no real reason and any sort of help would be greatly appreciated. I’ll respond to any questions if it helps clarify",05Sep2020,1
193,"I [21M] have been going through some stuff recently, and have been taking a real look at my mental health and what I feel. My first thought is that I might have depression, but the more that I read about depression the less it really lines up with what I'm experiencing. I don't have any urge to hurt myself or commit suicide, and I wouldn't say that it's something that constantly weighs on me. However, usually something triggers it for me and I'll go through periods of severe distrust and anger towards people that I think I know should be there for me. During this time I'll also hate myself, have panic attacks (difficulty breathing, shaking, heart racing, headaches), and find myself talking to myself without realizing it. I get so bored but I just can't get myself to get out of bed.

My point is that for depression it sounds like your outlook is generally that people shouldn't care about you. For me, I feel like I can't trust anyone, I desperately want to trust and feel accepted, and I wonder what is wrong with me that I can't be accepted and why it feels like even my closest friends are trying to hurt me. These feelings aren't exactly continuous; I do think I feel an overall sense of distrust and self loathing at all times but it's very slight and doesn't really affect me. But when I have these episodes these feelings explode and take over to the point where even though the one thing I want is to be accepted and asked what's wrong, I can't trust anyone and in most cases hate the people who would ask me that.

This time, it was triggered by my girlfriend coming back to live with our friends and I. I asked her out before spring break, not realizing that quarantine would happen, and then was forced to stay in my hometown and I didn't see her for months and months until a few days ago. We did an okay job of staying close but over time it just got really hard and I was having these episodes very frequently. Without her being there to defend herself I started to believe that she hated me and wanted to hurt me or that she was cheating on me. Once they ended, I'd feel normal and miss her but I'd also feel incredibly awkward because during these episodes I usually wouldn't talk to her at all; she wasn't exactly asking me to talk to her or texting me during these times. If she had, I probably would've responded. This isn't me blaming her, but rather explaining because the dynamic of our relationship was very weird.

I got back from my town a month and a half ago to help move our stuff in to our new place for the beginning of August, and I packed a lot of her stuff and moved it all for her, and genuinely just did a lot of things for her to try to make coming back as easy as possible. I was feeling a lot better with my friends around. She came back and instead of thanking me for helping she didn't even tell me when she got back, instead talking to all of our friends first. When I finally did see her I got a hey what's up before she walked away again. She talked to me once when she wanted to find out where I had packed some of her stuff. Then we didn't really talk at all for the next couple days, even though I was trying to start talking again. She'd shrug me off or sometimes outright ignore me, so I started to distance myself from her as being near her was really hurtful. Then my friends would make plans with her to go and do stuff and not tell me at all, and I'd just be left inside all day alone. They know that I get upset about that stuff.

Hoping to get things back to normal, I sat her down and told her that it wasn't working out. I thought maybe things were just awkward between us and we needed to sort things out. We ended up breaking up and that was a lot harder on me than I thought it'd be considering that I was pretty emotionally checked out to begin with. That was a few days ago and I've barely interacted with my friends since and I don't know how I can. I still try to talk to them, but none of them will say anything to me without me saying something first, and even if I do say something to them it'll just get a quick dismissive response. They must know something is wrong but they just don't care. A couple weeks ago on my birthday they threw a party and got me a really sweet card saying that they were my family. I don't know which it is but their actions speak so much louder than what was written on a card. 

This kind of turned into a venting post rather than a question, but I acknowledge that my risk for some sort of mental issue is pretty high; my mother has bipolar and depression and my father has some depressive tendencies as well, although he was never diagnosed. On top of all of this, I was abused as a child by my stepmother when my mom took me and left my dad when I was about 6. The abuse got worse as I got older but I was emotionally and physically abused while also being denied food etc. I take adderall and guanfacine for ADHD so once she stopped paying for my stuff I began selling my adderall to older friends of mine for some spending money when I was roughly 12. By the time I was 14 or so I finally got out and stayed with my dad. When this happened though, I discovered that nearly all of my friends didn't like me at school because I was annoying (probably because I wasn't medicated and ADHD). They felt bad for me and didn't have the heart to tell me that. This was more damaging than anything that my stepmother had ever done to me, and caused me to have nightmares and panic attacks for months after. I think this is the source of my issue honestly, and I don't know what I can do about it. I might've told my previous doctor about it but my current one I've had for exactly one visit and I don't know him well enough.

Does anyone else feel like this and have these symptoms? If yes, have you found any ways to overcome it and feel better? I just want to feel normal and it makes me so angry that I can't deal with this myself.

I have been having recurring thoughts of suicide again. I get very irritated when someone enters my room (home because corona). I don’t want to have a conversation with family.

All I do is lie in my bed and listen to music, sometimes draw. God I so fucking want to die. I often imagine myself driving off cliff, hanging, eating pills and imagining how my acquaintances would react to this news.            
        
Sometimes I punch walls, kick stuff, burn my palm or waste a whole matches box to watch the flame burn. My parents used to get worried, because I’m not antisocial.

203,"I (32M) just had another mental breakdown after a month at my new university. Here’s my history: I was diagnosed with chronic major depressive disorder at age 17 after a suicide attempt, but I don’t remember ever feeling happy before then either. After picking myself up, with help from meds and counseling, I attempted to go to a university the next year. I made it about 2 months into the semester before my depression and anxiety got real bad again and then I dropped out. I moved back to my hometown and got a job and despite being poor and miserable as an 18 year old on his own, I was somewhat ok. I tried going back to community college at age 20, made it about 2 or 3 months then had another breakdown and dropped out. Same thing at age 22, 3 months of community college, breakdown, drop out. At this point I had been diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder as well as depression. I stopped trying for school and just focused on myself and finding a way to feel like a human who could just live. I spent the next several years working kitchen jobs, and my anxiety and panic subsided while my depression remained. Kitchen work was less existentially pressuring, but the low wages and being surrounded by addiction and alcoholism and negativity wasn’t helping me feel like I was in a good place either.

So after years of becoming more balanced and functional, but not really any happier, I decided to go back to community college at age 27. This time I worked full time and only took 2 classes at a time. It took me forever to get my associates degree but I finally finished it last year, and with a 3.7 gpa. I felt like I was finally functioning and getting somewhere in my life. I received a full scholarship to a 4 year university, which required I attend full time, and I started school there this year. I wouldn’t be able to afford this school without this scholarship. 1 month into this semester, I had another breakdown, my first real/complete mental collapse since I was 22. 

I haven’t dropped out yet and I’m currently waiting to hear back from the administration to see what my options are, but I haven’t felt this low or this broken in a decade. At age 32, i feel like I’m running out of chances to get where I want to be. I’ve been able to do part time school but completely crash and burn whenever I try to take a full courseload. If I go part time to this school I’ll lose my scholarship and that’s the only reason I’m there right now to begin with. If I transfer to a cheaper school and go half time like I did in community college, I’ll have to take out loans, commit to going tens of thousands of dollars into debt, and I won’t finish my bachelors degree until I’m 37, at which point I’ll have spent a huge portion of my working years just surviving paycheck to paycheck and pursuing a degree, with years of paying off debt ahead of me well into my fourties, maybe even fifties. I feel hopeless. If I had given up on school a decade ago, I could be a head chef somewhere by now, making ok money and maybe even getting close to being able to buy a home. But I always told myself I was going back to school and didn’t want to get sucked too deep into the restaurant world, which I find depressing, unfulfilling, and unhealthy. What do I do when plan A just isn’t working, and plan B seems like a black hole of despair?

I don’t drink, I don’t do recreational drugs, I eat fairly healthy, and I exercise, but all those things just keep me treading water and prevent me from falling completely apart. I’ve never been able to get to a place where I feel happy or I feel good in my life and in my place in this world. I’ve tried so many different medications and they only help in times of extreme distress. When I’m functioning more normally, meds just make me feel really off balance and lifeless and uncomfortable and when I go off of them I eventually start to unravel again. My whole life I’ve used the idea that I have a future ahead of me and that things will be different to sort of push myself through the days.

I’m not sure what I’m looking for by posting this. Maybe I just needed to dump my thoughts and feelings and fears into the void. I’m going to go back to therapy and work with my school to see if my academic career is salvageable at all, but I’m beginning to resign myself to the fact that my brain just isn’t cut out for full time study. I know so many people have it worse than me, and that being able to go to school at all is a tremendous privilege. I just know I have so much passion for life and I’m really freaking smart and it’s so endlessly frustrating and painful to feel like everything I’m capable of doing or being is consistently sabotaged by my own mental fragility.

210,"To stay in the moment and not consume myself with thoughts tumbling out of control, I make it a challenge to do one thing at a time fully and completely. I do not write a long list of things to do. I write down exactly ONE task that I am going to do next. And it has to be a simple task. It can be something that is part of a larger goal or not. It does not have to be called a task. It can just be what I like to call, “a moment to catch.” A moment to catch/task for example: wash 3 plates in the sink. This is something I can complete and see completed in a short amount of time. The goal isn’t completion as much as staying in that moment.  I like to catch moments, even if it involves things I have to complete. 
When the task is done, I cross it out/erase it, completely discard of it and write the next thing I’m going to do. The length and size depends on what I’m capable of that day, hour or min. There is not pressure to do large or small tasks. It’s whatever you can handle. Here is another example. I write down: eat an apple. So that is all I do. I just eat an apple. I think about the apple, I feel the texture of it, how the smooth parts feel on my fingers and how it crunches in my mouth. Everything is about the apple. When I’m done, I cross that out and move on to the next. It’s very freeing to have one thing to do and one thing only and to focus on that one thing. It’s ok to have a long list off to the side and refer to it  but I find I stay present with one resounding TO DO or TASK or MOMENT TO CATCH in my face at a time. Do literally one thing at a time mentally and physically. Write it down, do not make it too complicated...if you are overwhelmed make it smaller, then do that task, complete that task, cross it out and write a new task. Other rules I use to stay present and forget about things I can’t control/slew of other anxieties that rob me of my well-being is to also make sure I’m slowing down my mind and body so I’m able to proceed. Not rushing. Rushing I find takes me out of the moment. Rushing I also find takes me longer to do anything or enjoy anything or complete anything because my mind is not paying attention to what’s right in front of it. That apple, that dish to be washed, a moment with a friend or family member, a nap!! Naps should be on your of your the side list if possible.

I have a plethora of trauma that I deal with daily, sexual abuse, isolation(youngest and black sheep of the family), mental illness, etc.,

Maybe just run in front of a bus. Anyway, it’s bad. Probably the worst it’s been in awhile. I’ve started to push someone I really care about in a romantic way away. Make him hate me so when and if I decide to do it, maybe he won’t be so sad.

If anyone needs a judgment free person to vent to or for advice or some motivation I’m always available. I recently lost a family member to suicide. He never seemed depressed, he never went to anyone for support. Depression itself makes you want to isolate but having pressure from family and society itself telling you that you’re gay or a sissy or not man because you experience this is so backwards and wrong.

TDLR: get anxiety when someone reads and doesn’t respond, want to stop having this response.

Does anyone else get anxiety when being left on read by certain people? I fully understand that people don’t owe me a response and have lives outside of me. However, this feels like an automatic response that I just can’t rationalise. If someone doesn’t read the message and doesn’t reply it’s fine but as soon as that message is read I get so anxious.

I have the most amazing partner that I trust and when he reads but doesn’t respond I worry that there’s something wrong (in terms of he’s upset or something, not something wrong with us). I feel fully secure in the relationship but I panic everytime out of control even though I know it’s ridiculous. I have had this for a long time and I just want it to stop because I don’t want to be an exhausting partner.

217,"For the past 3 years I’ve been struggling with my thoughts and emotions. I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I’ll try to explain it. I haven’t been very happy for the past 3 years. I’ve felt like everyday I’m getting worse and worse. My friends tell me it. My relationships have all failed because of it. And everything feels so gray. I haven’t had much happiness and everything seems to be making me sad or mad. I feel like today should be the start of trying to get help for this. My mother has bipolar disorder. And I likely have it too. But it also might not be bipolar. I want someone to help but at the same time I feel like no one will understand. I’ve tried a lot of things to try to make me happy like drinking and marijuana but they never help. They just make me feel even worse. I’d ask my mother but I’ve distanced myself from so many people including her. My moods always swing from left to right. Mad then sad or sad then mad. I try to be happy but it never stays long. This is my first time asking for help I don’t really know where to start to look for help professionally but I’m hoping right here is a good start. My home life never really was terrible so I don’t think people did this to me. I’m almost positive I have anxiety due to all my thoughts and worry’s. I don’t know if professional help would actually help me. Being junked up on tons of medications doesn’t sound extremely pleasant but if it could bring back happiness I’d do it in a heartbeat. This quarantine made me feel even worse. But it probably did to many others too. If anybody could help me figure out what’s wrong with me and could tell me the next steps to take mentally would help a lot. Also, what seems to really soothe all my thoughts is music. I literally listened to music 5 hours straight the other day. It really helps me. But I don’t want to listen to music to get me motivated to live life. Listening to music for that long of hours really just makes the days go by even faster. I’ve lost motivation to do lots of things and recently it’s been getting worse.

Apologise for the foul language.

So I told my family about a hour ago to fuck off. I haven’t lived with my sister and parents for about 12 years after my sister wanted a bigger bed room so they made it a point (not so subtlety) to make the house uncomfortable for me. Things like “your pets are too noisy at night” or “they use too much electric” I had several pets in my room, this has multiple since moving out.
So I haven’t felt like part of the family ever since they rarely invite me to meals, family visits etc or tell me about medical issues.
This is the spark that lite the keg for me today. So my dad was diagnosis’s with bowel cancer about 2 years ago which I didn’t find out for many months after he was diagnosed and that’s as only because a letter for his hospital appointment came to my house by mistake (we live in the same street about 20 doors apart). I was pretty livid at that but I kept it bottled up a S that’s my bread and butter. 
My mam had back surgery and it left her with nerve damage and drop foot. She had been going to appointments with my sister for about a year and never told me, when I found out and said I was coming to her next one the response was “oh, well nobody can come with me” when I asked about my sister my mam didn’t have a response beyond “she drives”. 
My aunt has kidney failure which I didn’t find out about until over a year after she had a kidney transplant. Yesterday my dad slipped up and mentioned she had a mri and has motor neurone disease and they were going to see her today. 
So I waited for a phone all about what time they were going  and never got one. I went to their house about a hour ago and asked what happened.
My mam and sister just nonchalantly said “about what”. When I said about aunt they said we went for a meal with your nan. I asked why they never called to ask if I wanted to come they said “oh well you can only have 5 people together at once”. 
And I tell you I was PISSED now. 

It just erupted. I shouted about not being told about medical issues (I’m a registered general nurse), about them not asking if I want to go and see family, about them never asking how I am (I’ve been epileptic for 4 years, have a history of depression, anxiety and suicide attempts), about how my sister was always spoilt, about how I was basically bullied out of the house, how they used to smack me with with wooden canes when my sister would cry and say I hit her even if I was upstairs.

229,"\- **Get into nature**. Take a short walk, eat lunch outside, go to a park for a half hour, even open a window and listen to the rain. Taking a few minutes to connect with the natural world help me feel grounded and relaxed.

* **Meditation.** At first it was very difficult to sit still for that long. But after the first week, I started to truly realise that all of my problems were in my own head. I was perceiving things poorly, from past images that I’d clung onto.
* **Yoga.** Please look after your body as well as your life! Follow your internal compass — your intuition. If something feels right, you’ll know. Even more poignantly, like in yoga, if something feels wrong, you’ll know for certain. When you’re practicing yoga, the movements at hand require a level of focus that demands that you be in the present moment. The practice pulls you from your thoughts because it is stronger than them.Getting into your body in this way is an antidote for rumination and a soother of worry. There are times to think, but during yoga, you are only required to move, and it requires your full participation.
* **Ritual.** For me, it’s making an afternoon cup of tea. Having a small ritual like this that you do at the same time every day provides a touchstone in the day. It’s best if the ritual is a healthy one, of course (i.e., not lighting up a cigarette or pouring a drink).
* **Avoid drama and the people who cause it**. Drama is what I call the manufactured junk that causes conflict and unhappiness. Some people seem like they must always be submerged in drama. My husband and I decided long ago that we weren’t going to tolerate it. We don’t befriend people who bring drama, and we work to keep it out of our relationship. It helps us deal much better with the real ups and and downs of life.
* **Try to maximize time spent on activities that induce «flow.»** Flow is the term for that magical time when you’re so immersed in what you’re doing that you don’t really notice the time passing. We are happiest when we are in flow. So when you do something and realize this is happening, make a mental note of it, and try to build time into your days for similar activities.

242,"Okay hi, new to this  subreddit but i dont really have anywhere else to turn.

Basically, i have one very depressed, suicidal sister who has self harmed for years. After many years of giving her support, she started to get better, let go of her traumatic break up and slowly heal. 

about a year ago she relapsed and my other sister started to feel very guilty about the whole situation, saying she didnt do enough. But it was pretty bloody impossible to help her anymore.

Anyway, now i have one suicidal sister and one sister riddled with guilt to the point where she has insomnia and intrusive thoughts.

The problem is, the suicidal sister is hiding that there is anything wrong with her, but she writes everything down on a public blog that my other sister found. So we know how she's feeling, she just lies to us about it. Which hurts my sister alot.

My insomniac sister believes she would 'heal' shall we say, if my sister was honest about how she truly feels instead of hiding it all the time.

I dont know what to do at this point. im so bloody sick of this mess, all over a useless fucking man.

I just want them both to be happy, and they're the furthest from it.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

How can you make someone talk about their feelings when they're so caught up in their own lie of being happy?",05Sep2020,1
243,"when I first started having issues with my mental health I self harmed by cutting and pulling my hair out. Thankfully I stopped cutting even though I still had the urge, overtime that went away I never stopped pulling my hair out I still do that.

244,I’m in the situation in my life where I’ve just graduated with a first in computer science. I’ve been applying to loads of places but yet to get a job but that’s ok it will come. My problem is that all my friends from home as well as my twin brother has all moved to the same city and are living together. I’ve been left to work in hospitality in a very very rural area. I have nothing to look forward to in the evening and literally do the same thing ever day. I wouldn’t say I feel lonely but each day gets hard. My mental health has taken a serious hit and I don’t know how to change it. I just don’t feel like me anymore,05Sep2020,1
245,I'm going to University on Wednesday and I am sort of excited for it but it seems as all my family are really happy for me and I just have to pretend and go along with it and put on a fake smile because it's how I should be feeling and how I want to feel but I just can't I'm pretty sure I'm suffering with OCD and moderate depression (for longer than I think) but I'm not saying I'm right but I'm pretty sure that it is I'm just so annoyed it happend during the biggest change of my life sort of ruining it. I know I shouldn't be throwing myself a pity party but I just really wanted vent. Also with my mum wanting me to get to uni before I see my doctor so I can get settled in and see if that helps which I'm sure it will but I just feel like I should have gotten a proper diagnosis first before but hey can't change the past. Even the stuff that desperately needs doing I can't pull myself together enough to do it I'm just so frustrated and really needed an outlet  all the self help books help but I just keep falling flat and getting into bad habits over and over again it's like a never ending cycle of disappointment and getting up again and keep trying,05Sep2020,1

248,"I've battled with my mental health for a while, I've sought help but only when I reached breaking point,  said breaking point was me punching myself in the face repetitively infront of friends and family til I couldn't see any more, I paid for counselling and things got better I was able to create boundaries I stood up for my self and for the first time in years I was happy.

I can feel myself slipping again, I was never officially diagnosed with anything I just worked through some issues but a few weeks ago I was folding clothes I got annoyed and started slapping myself in the face as hard as I could, I've only ever told one person (a friend not my partner he has no idea) about this as I know it's not healthy, I know I need to go back to counselling but I can't afford it right now, I feel happy  generally but I just don't like myself.

249,"He's 26 and I'm 13. I was helping this guy, who I'll call Dave, with his problems. We talked for a while and soon started helping each other out. One day, he said something about getting turned on by something I said. I felt uncomfortable, but didn't think too much of it. 

I felt uneasy talking to him at one point, and I said that I didn't want to talk to him anymore because of the age gap. He understood and we stopped talking. 

But about an hour ago, I got a message from him saying that he was watching a video about some dude that acted like a kid online and exposed pedophiles. Dave said that he saw some similarities with the people wanting to meet the younger girls, and that he was disgusted at himself. He told me that sometimes he would have sexual thoughts about young girls in real life, too. It was normalized for him because of his family, but he stated that it didn't sound normal at all. Afterwards he apologized to me. 

I don't know how to feel or what to say to him. I said that I was shocked and wanted to take some time to think about it. Does anybody know what to do? I'm scared.",05Sep2020,1
251,"I was too young to decide to leave or switch schools when I was in a horrible traumatic situation back then. I was trapped in a hell, or so it felt like. So now I'm scared to remain trapped again. Unable to escape a horrible situation. So I quickly leave new jobs, trainings, studies and so on. Usually either with a mental breakdown into average BPD symptoms (I suffer from it since I'm 15. I'm stable now (26) unless the outside pressure overwhelms me). I feel like I have to be on the run and be super careful and sensitive and analyze everything, to possible become aware of a new hell and to quickly escape this time. I feel like I can not survive getting trapped again. I feel like I'm unable to be aware of being trapped. I become hyper-sensitive. I did not help myself back then when the trauma happened. This time it's a difficult job-training again. I will have to put in a lot of effort. Like never before. And without the effort it already was hell!!! My sister persuaded me to accept the job-offering when she visited and put me down. She compared me to people who abuse the system and are just lazy. I believed her. The state wanted to put me to long-term sick/free money every month (enough to survive)/little work is still possible to at least live okay-ish. Every country will have different names for a system like that. Pension. Disability. That stuff.

I wanted to go that route with the state. But then my sister persuaded me again. I'm torn between sick and health for so long now. I don't know how to decide or if it's possible to decide that.",05Sep2020,1

256,"I can’t get interested in books, movies (don’t have the attention span for them anyway), tv shows, video games, even music, and that’s what used to help me the most. I don’t get excited about anything. I feel empty in a way. Part of me wants to go back to work only to escape the boredom I feel at home, but at work I stress a lot more about everyone being able to see how stupid and pathetic I am, which makes me dislike myself more.

Is this normal? To feel uninterested in pretty much everything. I don’t even know what I want to do with my life anymore. I mean there’s part of me that doesn’t even want to exist, but I’m also too scared to do anything to make that happen. My junior year of high school was when I thought I had a plan for what career I wanted. Now, I’ve don’t even want to do that, I don’t think.

I know it’s okay to not know what you want to do or study. I know tons of people change their majors, or take some years off, but it really seems like I won’t find anything now. Part of me doesn’t think I’m cut out for a career. Sure I have a job now, but it was basically handed to me. Some days I can barely handle it because it brings out my negative thought a lot, and I end up despising myself. Besides, even if I did have the confidence in myself, I still have no idea what I would even want to do. Everything seems so dull right now.",05Sep2020,1

If I wanted that shit I’d go to my high school teacher.  If it’s an immediate emergency call 911 right?  So they can send police to your house to “check” on you and leave.  Fuck you.
People talk about all these resources and how you can get help if you need it.   It’s all fucking bullshit.  These people couldn’t give a rats left nut about me.  It gets better my fucking ass.  At the very least stop fucking lying to me and say you’re supposed to help when you don’t.",05Sep2020,1

265,"I have no diagnosed mental illnesses, I have ADHD (learning disorder) however. Stimulants do not affect me, and I don’t just mean my medicine. Stimulant drugs don’t affect me either. I have done cocaine, Methamphetamine, adderall, Ritalin... all stims you can think of in both pills and street I’ve done. None really do anything to me aside from Ritalin which made me suuuuuper slow and sleepy. Middle school age 11 was when the social anxiety happened. I had no friends until age 16-17 in high school. I was a kissless virgin until age 18 but by then diabetes had already mostly rotted my genitals. I can’t build relationships with people no matter how badly I want it. I feel absolutely no empathy, I’ve even drugged my best friend and watched him OD and nearly die. I apologized... but I didn’t feel it inside and he could tell. My social anxiety is totally gone, I’m not a narcissist I hate them. One of my closest friends was one... he’s a piece of shit and I hope he sorts his Demons. I have extreme mood swings and random thoughts of suicide daily for years. I don’t feel deep emotion on the suicidal thoughts but they happen almost as if I’m subconsciously telling myself to do it. I don’t care for my diabetes. It bothers me that I’m gonna die... but for some reason I’m okay with it. I pace for hours going over thoughts in my head every night (the pacing is worse at night). I get insanely hyper right at bed time and can’t sleep until like 3-4am. I won’t go into detail about the empathy/remorse I lack but I can tell it’s not there.
