0,"I cant even talk to anyone about this cause honestly? People and teens specifically think it's some aesthetic to be depressed and sad. ITS NOT! I feel like dying today.. The perosn I opened up to, my boyfriend, made me feel so HAPPY and free, but these past days I just wonder if something happened to him. Cause he hasn't been chatting. And what's already worse is that I've already felt this numbness... And now the center of my numbness is my heart.. I dozed off this morning staring at the knife wondering if I stab myself in the heart... Would I finally feel something? Cause if I do feel something.. Then that would mean I have a purpose, right ? This quarantine cancelled my doctor's appointments and I can't even talk with my doctor about my clinical depression.. I don't know what to do with my life anymore. I feel so worthless.",08May2020,1
1,"I don’t know if this belongs here I’m sorry if it doesn’t.

I am a year and a half clean of sh, and in December I started counselling finally after waiting for 3 years, I was finally getting things together I had my life at a stable part for once then my counsellors decided I wasn’t a problem and transferred me I only had 3 sessions with them and I’m still on the waiting list.

I was doing a course I was doing fine on it but because I stopped having a place to go or talk to when I needed to I began to spiral again, I was doing cert 3 in disability care and now I’m trying to settle for a retail job because I can’t do it I’m trying to fucking hard but I have no one to talk to my friends don’t care and my family will blame themselves they’ve already been through so much cause of me I don’t know what to do anymore.

Worst part my counsellors contacted me a few weeks ago saying they hadn’t heard from me in a week and where worried, by that time I hadn’t seen them in 2 months so i don’t know if I’ll ever get into my new promised program or if I’m gonna be left to suffer again.

Worst part I’ve subconsciously started fantasising death again and I’m worried it’s gonna turn into something worse.",08May2020,1
2,"Hey, so I wantet to know if someone could tell me if I was still mentally healthy or what I should do next. Sometimes I have thoughts about killing myself. Just sometimes but when it happens its for a whole day. But what I worry about are other things. Sometimes I hear sounds like I really hear them but there is nothing. (only happens when I am really tired). Today I was laying in bed like 20 mins ago actually and.. I dont know how to describe it but I thought I am in a discord with a few friends. Everyone was talking except for one person. I cant tell for how long this happened but then I asked him why he is so quiet. Another friend replied: ""you know you are not really here, dont you?"". I couldnt catch myself for a few minutes. I cant really tell if I really heared them or if they were just in my head. (you know the difference between a hallucination so you think youre physically hearing it or just something in your head). Again it happens when I am tired but I wantet to make sure. Is this normal?

10,"What I did was pure meanness. Like I’m trying to figure out why I did it and I just can’t explain it. 

My boyfriend did something mildly stupid and embarrassing today. He was apologetic and felt guilty over it, he told me so privately. As a way to get reassurance he spoke about it to our roommates who where very supportive. 

For some reason this rubbed me the wrong way and I began berating him, reminding him of how stupid what he did was, basically rubbing salt on a fresh wound. And I wasn’t using a calm tone either, I sounded pretty pissed. 

After I was done I just left the room. He followed me minutes later and told me how unnecessary that was and how it hurt him. And I felt tremendous guilt. What was I thinking? I don’t know why I said those things... I know he has been kinda depressed recently. He can’t tell me why but he can tell he isn’t his usual self... How could I do this to him in his moment of weakness...

We talked about it because that’s what we do when we are upset, I apologized sincerely and he accepted my excuse but I just can’t forgive myself... I feel so bad for hurting him completely out of nowhere like that... I wasn’t even in the same room as he was when he was talking about it to roommates. I heard him talk, walked in, and berated him over his behaviour I KNEW he felt bad about... and I did it out of spite? I hate it how he can get away with anything, people forgiving his every mistakes, while my mistakes are always made to be a huge ordeal all the time. And because of that quiet resentment that built up over the years, I acted out of pure meanness. No other intention that to hurt him, to stop him from getting reassurance. At least I can’t find any other explanation... and that makes it even worse...

I feel so bad right now, he forgave me and moved on after our chat and went to play with roommates, but I am still in our room crying in guilt... I hate myself for what I did to him...",08May2020,1
11,"I’m aware that I’m not gonna get a diagnosis, but if someone has had experiences similar to mine, might be cool to know because I’m feeling pretty lost at the moment:

I’m 17F and have been diagnosed with PTSD, Anxiety and Depression, I also developed nyctophobia after the trauma that led me to develop PTSD. 

The nyctophobia bit is very relevant: it’s the phobia of the dark. 

My issue is that I very often feel observed, like there’s a foreign presence around me when I’m alone in a room. This is aggravated by silence, as any noise will seem threatening, so I always need to have a form of background noise when I do anything in a room alone. I feel like I’ve been having auditory hallucinations: I always feel like someone is calling me, when in reality, no one in my household was talking

This sensation of observation is worstened at night, I use a small light when I sleep because I can’t sleep in total darkness, but it’s more so that if I wake up, I can see that I’m in my bedroom than to lighten my room (think the baby lights used in toddler rooms), which also help me locate the switch to my lamp if I wake up and need more light. All this to say that at night, my bedroom is pretty dark, but I have a feeling that there’s someone watching me in my sleep, sometimes that this person is right beside me, but I can’t see or hear them. 

I’ve only seen them one time: I was on a school trip 4 years ago and have one night, woke up to a black silhouette kneeled at the side of my bed, saying ‘Hello [my name]’, I don’t remember their voice, only that it wasn’t threatening or scary. I know that I sound fully crazy when I type those things out, especially that when I’m in broad daylight, these things seem so trivial and stupid. But they feel so real when they happen. 

At night, I become more paranoid of everything, I sleep with a teddy bear to keep me calm, but I’ve started to be scared of it too, as if he would start attacking me in my sleep. 

I’m confused by what I’m feeling, and I don’t know how much of all of this could be due to my other issues. But I’ve been asking myself some questions, especially since there’s a long history of mental illness in my family: my dad is a narcissist (caused my trauma but I won’t go into details because it deserves a post on its own), a distant uncle has had paedophilic behaviours, my aunt has schizophrenia, perhaps I might be suffering from something more severe?

I plan on asking this to my new therapist, since I’m gonna need to move for university after the lockdown, to see what he thinks of all of this, but he doesn’t hold video calls and I wanna be followed by one continuous doctor, who knows about my medical history and personal history.",08May2020,1

15,"Hello, so I had a really weird interaction today. I just was done talking to my psychologist and was on my way home, got prescribed medication to help with sleeping and managed to talk about a lot of stuff that's been bothering me for a long time. So while I was waiting for the train this guy just started screaming at the top of his lungs, usually just screaming and then once in a while he screamed psychopath. Everyone on the train station was looking around like wtf is going on trying to make sense of it all. It goes quiet for a minute then this guy starts walking up to where I'm waiting and starts screaming as soon as he gets there. I got spooked a bit so I shook and he screamed young man, directing at me i guess. So I didnt know what to do so I just kinda looked, laughed in myself and asked if he was alright. The dude just walks past me, sits down quiet and starts screaming again a while later. The poor guy next to him had no clue what was going on and got spooked aswell, so half a minute later people from the train station come to him to figure out what is up and the dude starts talking about how he was abused by a famous TV producer because of bitcoins (I looked into this at home and it turns out facebook advertised bitcoins with a picture of this producer's face or something without the producer's consent, I mean maybe I'm crazy but I don't really think that is abuse?) I should note that right before they got there, the guy told me maybe he should kill me instead because I laughed. I was listening to music on my headphones so I just act like I didnt hear him and ignored it.

So they chat to him and ask him to be quiet on the train and he says ok, train gets there and  everyone gets on. I don't trust this guy so I make sure I get on last. He sits down and he's literally DEAD. SILENT. the entire time. We're at the 2nd the last stop, the dude gets up, stands right next to me and spits his chewing gum at me or something. Luckily he missed but I was fucking furious man, I just wanted to strangle the guy right there and then. It's so disrespectful for no reason. But I managed to keep my cool and the conductor saw it, stopped him and made him talk it out with me. So we did which was really difficult and I said to him that that shit's disrespectful and that I laughed because its a weird situation, which he agreed with. Then he realises he has to go to the last stop and sits back down next to another person, so the conductor got pissed off and was like wtf you doing it's corona, which was pretty funny (bad ofc but that this guy tried to pull that shit baffles me) So same story as last time, I make sure I'm last off the train and he goes into the train station, and just started screaming again. He got stopped by police and I had to get involved aswell because of the whole incident, the police got our info and I was free to go, they kept him around for awhile and idk what happened to him. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I deal with this? I was really shaken by the whole thing because of the screaming, it triggered really bad memories in me and I think his whole story of abuse is so disrespectful to people who actually go through abuse, not even mentioning the spitting and what he said to me. I decided not to press charges at the time (the police asked if i wanted to do anything with this) because I've never met a person who deals with some kind of trauma like this, and I didn't have any grudges against the guy, I don't even know who he is. He said lots of people think hes schizophrenic when he got questioned, is this a thing that can happen with schizophrenia or some kind of mental illness? I know a few people who deal with schizophrenia but they dont do anything this extreme. Every scream felt so forced aswell because he pretty much prepared for it it seems, like took a deep breath and stuff, so I feel like he was just trying to pick a fight or something which just pisses me off more. I'm also really worried that he managed to catch my name from my id and that he's gonna stalk me or something. Should I press charges against him?

16,"Quarantine at home means staying with my mom. While i have tolerated long periods being with her, there are times that we really can't just be together in one roof. If she were not my mom, i don't think i can be friends with her.

 I grew up mostly with her since my father works overseas and eversince we never had a good relationship. I remember her being very physical. Most of the time idk why she's very mad at me to hit me (with whatever that she reaches. We're Asian btw so...). It could be something minor, like not finishing my food to something major like talking back to her. As a kid, i didn't know that 'Asking' or 'Providing reason why' is considered talking back by adults. I was that kid. I thought i was just providing an explanation to my actions but i was talking back.  I would always ask/ say something (ie. ""but i'm already full"" or ""but i don't like to wear that""). Everytime we had a fight she'd always say hurtful things, she knows how to get personal and tear your self esteem to pieces instead of explaining to me what i did wrong and why. She would tell me i'm ugly, i have a disgusting attitude no one would become my friend, that i will grow up terrible and be not successful, i will never find happiness etc. i was not even 10 yo back then. She's manipulative. Forcing things on us. She'd tell us things about other relatives, even about my father and make us believe they're this or that. I thought she was telling the truth because despite of me hating her, i was still scared of her and believed her. I did hate my father at one point because of what she said. Later on i realized that all of those were just her opinions of other people and majority weren't even true. She's just a rigid human being who can't live under the same roof with someone who can't conform to what she wants. I consider her a hypocrite.

I grew up trying to prove her wrong. I also developed gen. Anxiety disorder and panic attacks and at one point got very depressed. But i worked my way out of it. I saw a doctor and all that. I tried to understand why and tried not to put the blame on her because i know it's also partly me. I am trying to work my way around building even just a proper relationship with her ( no fighting in a month ). But she's like in a box. Recently, my father started baking dt quarantine. He was a decent baker but my mom will always complain. The first thing she'll always say after seeing (not even tasting) what he did is "" You should've put this"" or "" It's not this because you didn't add butter"" in a very know-it-all manner. I know you take pride on your cooking but the old man just followed a recipe successfully, why can't you just appreciate that? It goes Everytime someone cooks tbh. I got tired. We tried to explain that that's the recipe and i tried to ignore her remarks but she was really going at it like a judge. So i told her that she do it next time her way if she didn't like this way. Now everytime i'm in a room with her she'd nag and attack me personally again. Telling me that she will tell my boyfriend this and no guy will ever date me again, that i was always a terrible child, that people thinks i'm kind but i'm not, etc.  I ignore her but she's getting on my nerves and my head that i'm questioning myself if i'm turning out like her, that if my efforts weren't fruitful etc. That what if what i think i am isn't who i really am and i am actually a bad person like she says. I worked my ass out to graduate college because she said i won't, even going as far as getting a post grad. I didn't get pregnant at college like she expected me to be and i have a very decent and understanding boyfriend. But once she starts talking again, i question  myself of who i turned out to be. I'm so frustrated because i worked from zero to build my self esteem and tried so hard to prove her wrong my whole life and i wish i took the chance to go overseas rather than take a postgrad.",08May2020,1

21,"Hey I’ve posted this in r/antidepressants first off but thought I’d also put it here too as there’s a lot more members!! 


so around a year ago I finally plucked up the courage to start to deal with my mental health and try to get support - starting with my GP. I was prescribed 50mg Sertraline in the first instance which gradually increased to 150mg. I stayed on this for 7/8 months. I had my ups and downs with it - I noticed a difference for sure, but the side effects seemed to never cease. My sleep worsened considerably, I would sweat a lot - which only added to my social anxiety and paranoia - and I sometimes felt like I had lost my personality. 

After speaking with my GP numerous times, I was finally referred to the mental health team where i was then advised to move to mirtazapine (December 2019/January 2020) I was told this was going to help me sleep so I quite literally snatched it (sleep is the best escape after all). It really did improve my sleep which was amazing and I miss that a lot... Anyway, I titrated (too quickly in hindsight, but that’s another story which involved a serious breakdown) and moved onto mirtazapine. Whilst the sleeping benefits were amazing, my mental health collapsed. I felt I was getting fatter and fatter and couldn’t even motivate myself to do anything anymore. The suicidal thoughts became more intense and recurring. I knew I had to change. 

After many battles (and it shouldn’t have to be battles but lol tories underfunding the NHS), I was referred to a psychiatrist who suggested that I be moved onto venlafaxine (March 2020). I’m on the immediate release starting dose 75mg. I’ve found that it has really elevated my mood on the whole, which is great. Essentially, I feel like I have better perspective and am able to live life without constant negativity and despair which is surely what I want from an anti depressant. 

However, my anxiety is certainly not decreasing — in fact I’m worried it is increasing? I’m now questioning whether to even stay on the drugs as I’m reading about long term side effects, particularly memory loss and loss of libido / sexual stimulation, as well as the seemingly horrific process of actually coming off the drug. It makes me feel like I’m going to have to be on venlafaxine for the rest of my life just so that I can survive and function. Is that ok? 

I was just wondering if anyone could give some advice or guidance around this? I’m not too sure what my question is to be honest but I’m just feeling pretty panicked... I feel like I need them to live but equally am doubting whether I should be taking them at all? Does anyone else feel this way? I’ve considered increasing the dosage as I know I’m on the lowest dose and have always increased with the previous medication - is this the same thing? 

I have a lack of trust with doctors - perhaps somewhat irrationally - so I find hearing lived experiences much more fulfilling. If anyone has any experience or advice at all it would be great

Hope you’re all staying safe - peace and love x",08May2020,1
22,"I'm sitting here trying to finish my final papers for my classes and I can't stop thinking about what it would be like to live without obsessing over your appearance. I don't know anyone in my real life who doesn't have some form of body dysmorphia so it prompted the question: Does everyone have a certain level of body dysmorphia that they live with? I find myself surrounded by people who are constantly working out to try and achieve their perfect body. I am definitely one of those people. However,  I realize that ""gymming"" is one of the only things that people are more open about.  

What about those internal struggles? I don't brush my teeth every morning and every night because I'm passionate about dental hygiene, I do it because I don't want anyone asking me, ""why are your teeth so yellow?"" I have a lazy eye because I have astigmatism so one of my eyes crosses inward AND it makes one of my eyes look smaller than the other. When I don't wear eyeliner it's way more noticeable. The only reason that I realized that my eye was bad is because last year someone commented on it and I still think about what he said: ""Do you have a lazy eye? I'm asking because one of your eyes crosses inward and I can' t tell where you're looking."" I find myself avoiding pictures if I know that my lazy eye is very bad that day.  I have so many issues with my face it would be draining to list them all. I am a singer, I love to sing, and I want to put myself out there (take videos of me singing and stuff) but because of all the insecurities I have about my face I find myself avoiding singing altogether because I make weird faces when I sing. I've also resorted to working out recently because I've convinced myself that if I can commit to that ""hot girl summer body"" then it'll distract from my face. 

I don't think my problem with my self-image is extreme but I'm not dumb - I know that it's not normal to obsess over your appearance every day. I know that if I had enough money then I would definitely get as many surgeries as I could so that I can stop obsessing over my physical shortcomings. I've never gone in-depth about the problems that I have with my physical appearance to anyone and honestly, it's so draining to live like this, but I feel that if I don't try to fix myself then I'd be letting myself go and I'd be worse off than I am right now. 

That's why I got to thinking about life without body dysmorphia. Is it possible to live carefree and free from those voices in your head constantly criticizing your physical appearance?

23,"Last year my mental health was really bad. I’m a high school student who is starting to go into adulthood, and I worried so much about my future and everything going on in my life.

 I didn’t want a job, but I knew I had to get one sooner or later, but no job sounded the slightest bit enjoyable and I had no motivation to look for one, so I didn’t do anything.

The other main concern of mine was college. I had no idea what I wanted to do (still don’t) but I sorta knew if I didn’t get a job, the other alternative is college. College sounded so stressful and scary and I had no idea what I’d study. 

That was all stacked on top of my loneliness which I’ve just always dealt with due to very very few “friends”. So to say the least, I was anxious and scared but also unmotivated to change my situation. 

ANYWAY I wrote all that in past tense. Not because I’m thriving now facing my fears and all that good stuff. But because I’ve blocked out all that stuff from my brain.

 I’m no longer often anxious, but that’s because I haven’t thought about the future in months. I’m in no rush to change my situation because my mind is refusing to acknowledge it. I’ve become numb. 

And being numb may be more scary than anything. 

I’m going to sit here and watch the world go by without me while I do nothing to better myself. My after high school life is gonna hit me like a brick wall and I’m not concerned. When I get there I’ll do what I’m doing now. Nothing.

I’m not sure if this is a cry for help or what, but it feels right to type it out. Sorry it’s long. If you’ve been here before, I’d like to hear what you have to say. Or even if you haven’t I still would like to hear. Thanks",08May2020,1

27,"Sorry for formatting, on mobile. Might be a dumb question, I am really clueless when it comes to dealing with emotion. I hit a breaking point a few days ago and decided to try my hardest to begin recovery on my own, even though I can't get therapy right now. I've been thoroughly attempting to confront emotions I would normally try and suppress by any means necessary. I read an article on self-validation and I've noticed that I tend to invalidate myself often by avoiding negative feelings or judging myself for having them. I've been keeping a journal for a few years now, which helps me organize my thoughts, vent, and sometimes helps me understand why I've been feeling a certain way. Many of my emotional responses to every day situations are difficult for me to understand. I've come to realize this is because they are often rooted in my particularly negative childhood experience. They are patterns of thought set in motion by abuse that happened years ago. So to expand upon my question, does searching for the specific event or series of events that might've caused a particular negative thought pattern help or harm my recovery? I feel like it helps me empathize with myself more, but I worry that I might just be picking at the wound when I should just be accepting the existence of a feeling without reading more into it than necessary.

Developed severe social anxiety as a kid. Never had any close friends. I'm soon 33.  
I met someone recently i felt a strong connection too, a woman i fell in love with. We were a couple for a few weeks. Sadly she didn't fall in love with me. And now I have severe anxiety because of it. The separation anxiety has triggered a strong depression, something i haven't had for years. I do feel depressed a lot of the time, always have, but not to the point where it affects my life to the degree it does now. Not since my most depressive years ten or so years ago.  
When i think of her now, or anything what reminds me of her, i get a very physical anxious feeling in my chest, and it's very crippling. I miss her, and what we had, so much.

I long so damn much for connection and feelings of being loved and appreciated,  and having a strong connection with someone, something i felt I've missed my whole life.  
I felt that with this woman. We spent almost every day and night together for the weeks we saw each other. And it meant a lot to me. But not as much for her. And it breaks my heart. To find what you are think you are looking for, and then lose it, is fucking awful.  


I feel like I take this a lot harder than most people. Could it be that i have issues with separation anxiety caused by my family issues growing up? A father that left because of drugs, and a severely depressed mother that wasn't emotionally stable or available. Can anyone relate?",08May2020,1
29,"I was just reading through the symptoms of BPD and honestly I could relate to about 95% of the ones included on that page. It was suggested by a GP but not confirmed by any psychiatrist ( not that I have much faith in them anyways) 


However don't you ever feel that mental health conditions are quite subjective, like it all depends on who is treating you? 

I don't believe I have BDP Because to me, it's just some behaviours mushed together formed into a man made condition. Same with other conditions too

 Anyone feel the same? 


Also I am aware that genuine people out there who may have had perfect upbringings feel like shit due to chemistry etc so I amn't denying that real mental health cases exist",08May2020,1

32,"things that used to make me happy, i don’t care about. i used to be so passionate for dancing and it was my world, now i don’t care for it. Same with school, i used to be committed and motivated and inspired and determined to be my best all the time but i don’t feel anything.

i work really hard in school. i study every night for 4.5 hours and i’ve always done this. well for the last 3 years, before that, i was rebelling, i didn’t care about education. i got suspended twice and got in trouble at school. then i did. i went from Cs to straight Bs within a year. Like i was doing great. First place in Drama, best female athlete, top 10 in all my classes.... whatever

My school isn’t full of the smartest people, in fact, they don’t care about education at all. There’s a class for those who actually care and they happen to be really arrogant so i never joined that class but had so many opportunities to. i wanted to prove everyone wrong and show i could do it without being privileged and i can do anything because i’m intelligent and determined.

i developed an eating disorder after being surrounded by friends who called me fat and ugly all the time so i made it a goal to lose weight. I was bullied by my dance group badly. so shit was tough. it became my norm that i was never going to be good enough no matter how good i actually was. but i got over it because i’m tough and im strong and focused on my grades. i’ve still been struggling to eat but i try my best. 

my issue is that i never get rewarded for how hard i work. i’m always second best and i never get a chance. sometimes i think the teachers are bias because of who i used to be and the fact i challenge them academically with debates. (pls understand i go to a low SES school) my grades are now a mix between mostly As and some Bs. i did a lot to get where i am but unfortunately, i just feel everyone is so against me. i got told that i did super good in my pe assignment and that there was no changes to be made. after i handed it in, i got my marks back, 13/15, second best and my teacher had a long paragraph to criticise my work. i got 25/25 for my cafs assignment, first place for once and i was so fucking happy and thought this was my break through. this was my shot. Then i found out about 6 people also got full marks. that’s when i started to feel absolutely nothing for anyone or anything because this has happened to me for the last 3 years. always second best. not good enough. 

i’m not complaining about failure. that’s life and i just have to work harder next time. i understand that. i’m just feeling like my efforts are never properly rewarded. i work so hard and it’s rewarded to the kids who were the best before me. these teachers blow so much smoke up my ass but its all a lie. i’ve lost all motivation and have lost purpose. i deserve better but i don’t even know what i’m doing anymore. why the hell do i want to be the best?

for a long time i just wanted to prove them all wrong. prove my haters wrong. show them that i can do anything. but now my whole world is falling apart and people keep letting me down... i am tired of not being seen for who i am. now i’m constantly angry and i’m not that type of person. 


please give me some solid advice because i’m not one to give up easily but i’ve been trying so hard to feel something, anything and i can’t.... i want to be better. i want to be me. i want to care. i want to find joy in the things i used to.

maybe isolation is killing me.",08May2020,1
33,"When I was a kid my mom was gone most of my childhood (not completely gone but moved to another state and tried to build a safe life for us, we still talked) , I was raised by my grandparents. 

My mom finally came back and we moved into a place together when I was peeking into my teenage years. She has bipolar disorder and I was in my teens - hormones going crazy and needed her to guide me, to help me/discipline but she couldn’t because of what she was going through. She was emotionally unavailable and every time I asked her advice it always ended up “fear-based/anxiety/defensive/worse case scenario”. 

I became very ANGRY! That I finally was with my mom but I just wanted more, more connection like somebody had my back. My best friend at the time was cutting herself and one day in the mist of an argument with my mom I started cutting myself (I wasn’t hardcore with it though, it was pussy scratches tbh) I just wanted her to see what how much I needed her and how she’s hurting me. 

It ended up with her calling the cops and I went to a mental hospital for TWO WEEKS, they diagnosed me with bipolar, gave me medicine that made me act like a lunatic. 

After I came back home I found a boyfriend, we fell in love. I moved in with him for 5 years, I saw a whole different side of life with his family- connection, love and understanding - no yelling or screaming every day or abusive communication. It was great. I have become a completely DIFFERENT person, I’m meditating, I’ve been going to therapy for 4 years and my self-control is beyond great, I don’t ever freak out or panic. Unfortunately our relationship ended and I moved back in with my mom.

LISTEN TO THIS:

She almost had me one day AGAIN, freaking out, yelling, maybe might’ve broken everything around me and ended up back in the crazy house but you know what I told myself? I grabbed the Bible and I said “I’ll never let my mom EVER make me act like this EVER again, this is not me, this is HER.” Then ever since then, I haven’t, I look at it as I’m stronger now, if I can deal with her without reacting I can deal with ANYONE.

Now here where God comes into play:

She had has a boyfriend now. And I get to see an outside perspective how she used to treat me and gaslight me all the time. She verbally abuses him, makes him question himself and what he does, makes him feel incapable, starts over the top arguments to the point where she threatens to call the cops on him and kick him out, won’t leave him alone - you get the deal. And the craziest part, he never retaliates even if she’s harassing him/ screaming in his face. 

I just see now it was never me, I was a lost teenager longing for a mom who could be what I always wanted. 

Now I’m better but I’m still so angry that I was diagnosed with some bullshit because I was a teenage girl living with a bipolar mother by herself being continuously gaslighted by her. I was being bullied in my own home. 

Till this day right now I still can’t believe I went through something like that and wonder how many people get put into this situations with misdiagnosis. It messes with my head have I been misdiagnosed?",08May2020,1

After I figure out I’m in deep thought and know I need to snap out of it I’ll blurt out words, mostly the words “fuck” or “fuck you” (referring/talking to myself because I see myself in that embarrassing moment and think “wow you fucking idiot”) uncontrollably. I seem to not do it when I’m around people because I’m focused on them/their convos. But by myself or with my GF I’ll do it 3 times in 30min or so, depending. I didn’t use to do this.

38,"When I checked my school email today I opened an email that basically told me I'm required to withdraw from my University. I don't know what to do and I can't tell anybody because I've been lying to everybody around me and telling them I'm a good student.

I expected it to be honest because I've failed every class that I've this year (I'm a first year student). I was actually doing really well my second semester but after covid-19 happened I was forced to study and do my exams in my extremely toxic home environment. So any chance of doing well was basically gone.

I've had a really rough year this year. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety which didn't go over well with the family, and part of the reason why I'm depressed is because of them. My parents are against medication for things like depression and anxiety because they ""change your personality"" so I was never able to take meds. My parents are going through a really nasty divorce and there's always fighting in the house. My dad is a real piece of shit who's essentially been draining all of our money and cheating on my mom every chance he gets. He blames their problems on me and has been verbally abusing me every chance he gets. My grandma's been diagnosed with the most aggressive form of lung cancer there is and doesn't have much longer to live, and my mom can't be with her because of covid-19. She's really stressed and upset and if I tell her what's going on I think I'd break her. Everything's been going downhill and somehow I can't help but feel like it's my fault.

I'm so upset with myself because I know I should've tried harder and pushed past everything that was going on and just studied. At this point I don't even know what to do anymore. I wrote this post because I have absolutely no one to talk to. I don't know what to do with myself.",08May2020,1
39,"Before I start, it it isn’t obvious, a very heavy trigger warning on s*lf h*rm, s*ical thoughts/tendencies, etc.. read at your own risk. 

Hi, I’m in the southeast, and a minor. I’ve never been officially diagnosed with anything, but I’ve been hospitalized for self harm (this is important for later) and I’ve had a couple attempts. I’ve felt suicidal for about four years now and haven’t seeked help. Recently I had enough and told my mom I needed help, it was harsh, and the conversation consisted mostly of me yelling and crying.

She said she was going to look for somebody who would take my insurance but hasn’t spoken on it since. Ever since I told her I’ve felt even worse. I haven’t felt this bad since the time I was hospitalized for self harm, which was June 2018. It got so bad, I relapsed. I was nearing four months clean, and I did it a lot more. Instead of a knife and a small line I took a razor blade and made multiple. 

These past couple of days have been hell for me. I can’t even look in the mirror anymore without wanting to scream. As I type this I am crying into my stuffed animals. I started doing stupid impulse things, just to feel a bit better for a couple of moments before regret hit, I shaved my head, shaved half my eyebrows, started screaming at myself when nobody was home, I’ve thought about running away, about stealing the car, about stabbing myself repeatedly just to feel something other than this sadness.

Alas, nothing has been working. So I started looking into mental hospitals. I know if I keep going on like this I will do something extremely dumb, and I think it’s what’s best for me. The bad news? I’m terrified. The one time I was hospitalized two years ago it was only for a day and it was hell. I lied to get out quicker. Lied about how I felt, if I was suicidal, why I cut, etc.

I want to know if I should ask my mother to take me to one or if I should wait and see if she actually gets me a therapist. I want to know what it’s like in a ward, about other people’s experiences and if I should risk it.

I live in Georgia, and I would most likely go to one in Atlanta if that helps.

I crawled out of the lowest levels of poverty by investing in myself between periods of substance use binges and depression and suicidal periods. I am now 3 years sober and 2 year free of self harm and suicial tendency. I am now to a point where I find my emotions to certain things are broken. I could go on and on about the different emotions and responses I have to them, but I'll leave you with one. If you know the show Derek with Ricky Gervais, it is one of very few shows or things that can make me feel enough to tear up or and have a strong 'sad' emotion. The whole sad part of this show triggers a flash back to suicide and a complete internal narrative of, ""I think it's time to kill myself.""

Problem is, it won't stick. I won't actually believe any of the rational thoughts I have. In the moment, I can have an inner dialogue that seems SO sane. So normal and future-oriented and all that fun stuff. But that feels like the problem itself. I flip-flop on my opinions and my feelings to the point that everything feels impulsive because, most likely, the last time I thought about that and really focused on thinking about it, I was thinking about it in the right way. Next thing I know, I've either taken a dumbass action motivated by emotion or I fall into inaction for whatever reason. In the moments where I don't take action, skip an event, cancel on plans, it's basically a black-out. It's been like that for the past 4 years and I feel like I haven't grown at all. My environment has shifted marginally and, on paper, my life is okay. But that's not how it feels, because none of it makes sense. I'm obsessive about things that DO NOT matter at all.

52,"I'm a 19 y/o female. I have lots of health issues including type 1 diabetes, ileostomy, lupus, alopecia, anemia, endometriosis, chronic depression, anxiety, and severe ADHD. 

For context, I've always struggled with my mental health. My ADHD made it impossible to get any of my schoolwork done. I was put on Vyvanse - it worked for a few days, but then the drive it gave me faded over time. I told my mom this and she said I had to just keep going and it would come back to me and it never did. 

I got depression when I was 12, and I was put on Prozac. The same thing happened - the effect of the medicine faded after a while, I told my mom, she said I wasn't trying hard enough to try to be happy. But I didn't know what to do, so we just didn't do anything about it. Eventually I stopped taking it altogether since it wasn't working.

Ever since sixth grade I've always been slacking. I would try to do homework and my mind would always find a different thing to think about or I would stare aimlessly out the window. This continued up to my senior year when I started taking college classes. It started out good, and then I slacked and got distracted, and failed the class. My mom was furious, and kept saying ""you just need to do it, failing isn't an option. You need to go to college because without a good degree to get you a good job you won't be happy and you won't be able to pay for your health insurance."" I tried again the second semester of senior year and the same thing happened. Now both my parents - who were divorced - were saying the same thing over and over: just do it, it's so simple. You're making it hard for no reason.

I attended a college in my freshman year that said they had a good disability program, but it really wasn't great. All they did was help me with a schedule to plan time for homework. But the roommates I had were extremely messy, they were party people, and they fought a lot. I was still on the Vyvanse at this point, even the same dosage, even though it hadn't been working since when I told my mom that it wasn't working. She always believed that I wasn't trying hard enough - I'm not saying she was wrong but I think a change of medicine or something would have helped me a little more. 

I failed that college, and of course my parents were disappointed and furious. I felt like I was just sucking the life out of them and the people who were trying to help me, so I tried to kill myself by overdosing on tylenol. I found out later that it's hard to die immediately from overdosing on that stuff. At some point I told my mom what I did, and all she could say was ""Don't you know that's a mortal sin? Do you want to go to Hell? There's always a better option."" Eventually she forgot about it, because I hinted at it later in my life and she had no idea what I was talking about. I think the thought of suicide made her uncomfortable so she didn't remember it.

I tried once again at a different college. The first semester was difficult and I ended up being put on probation. My mom found out, so did my dad, and she was again hurt and furious. I tried to kill myself again, same process, because I wanted to stop hurting my parents and I thought I wouldn't change and I was lying to my friends about my academic success and I hated myself so much because I hadn't changed since I was in the sixth grade. 

The school gave me a second chance, and I was actually doing well this time despite the medicine not having an effect on me. It was hard but I was finishing work and turning it in on time. Then COVID happened, and I was sent to my grandmother's house, because it's in the middle of nowhere and I have a compromised immune system - my parents didn't want me to be near any crowded cities, like where my home is. 

That's when it all fell so quickly. My depression came back extremely hard because there wasn't anything distracting me from it, like lectures or friends or meetings. My ADHD also got worse - I would tell myself ""I have to do this assignment"" and instantly, my mind would pull away from that idea and think of anything else, whether it was my cat or a movie I saw or any random thought, and I would forget about the assignment. Then, the longer I didn't do any work, the more anxious I got about contacting my professors. I contacted my old Psychiatrist but she no longer took my insurance, she directed me to someone who did but they have not answered any of my emails yet.

I also got really depressed from the house: it has barely any windows, it's always dark and cold - the heat is broken, she hasn't fixed it for four years - and it's extremely cluttered, like she has unfinished furniture everywhere, there's dust all over the place, we have a storage pantry with food from the 80's, and there's so much stuff everywhere it's like walking through a maze. I felt suffocated. I tried to tell my mom this and she said that everyone was feeling this way because of the pandemic and I shouldn't worry. It made me feel then like I shouldn't talk about how I feel because I'm not thinking of the other people who also feel this way.

I tried killing myself again because I was so stressed and upset and my mind was a constant knot of noise - just thoughts of me screaming at myself to get off my ass and do something, random songs stuck in my head, frustration with the house and my grandmother continuing to try and tell me how the way I functioned was redundant and wrong. It wasn't like these thoughts would pop up every now and then, it was CONSTANT. There was never a moment where I could get away from them. It almost felt as though I was hearing them through my ears, not my brain. I tried suicide again because I wanted it to shut up, and nothing would make that happen in real life. I also didn't want to face my parents again with the fact that I had failed college for the fifth time in a row. I just wanted to end it because I didn't want to worry about anything at all ever, whether that be how much medical supplies I have left, what assignment is next, which professor is emailing me, when to get my next insulin shot, etc. And I figured I had tried before so it wasn't that big a deal, I just had to keep taking bigger handfuls of pills each time to try and actually die. But obviously it didn't work.

I spoke with my mom just a few hours ago. She said that she got a letter from the school saying that they were kicking me out, even though I'm still finishing the spring semester. She had also planned a beach trip to try and get me out of my head and get some sunlight. I thought she would be mad again, but she wasn't entirely furious. She told me what would happen next was probably to find a job back at home so I can at least make some money. But I couldn't stand that though because I had always believed that college was everything, that I wouldn't be able to pay for the medicine that keeps me alive without a degree, that I would never be happy without it. When she told me about the letter I started bawling - silently, I didn't want her to know - because I felt that it meant I was completely incapable of finishing anything, that it was set in stone that I couldn't be responsible and get things done. I asked her to cancel the trip because I didn't want to risk getting COVID, but really I don't want to even try to have fun when I've just found out that everything is over for me. But now I'm upset because, no matter how much I feel like my mom didn't listen or went overboard on me, I love her more than anything and I miss her, I feel like I lost the last chance to see her. I hate myself for hurting her over and over by failing college and I wish I could make better choices so she wouldn't suffer because of me. I hate myself because I now know I can't do anything. 

I'm thinking of suicide again but it never works so I'm not sure. But I want things to be different. I've been crying hysterically every moment I get alone, and I'm not exaggerating. I feel like I need to be in a mental hospital because of everything that's going on in my head, but I know my parents would say that I would just be copping out and selfish if I did that. But something has to change, I can't stand living like this. And I don't see myself ever being happy, or just being ok, if I can't finish college. I feel like I'm at a dead end no matter where I go, but I also can't just sit down and breathe because there's so much in my head. I don't even know what I'm asking for help with by posting this, I just need someone to be able to understand this feeling and how much I hate myself right now. If I told my parents that (I have before) they would tell me to stop being dramatic. I don't know what to do, I need to get out of whatever state I'm in right now.",08May2020,1

56," I had gone through old social media private messages about a month ago, and was genuinely horrified what I saw. Through high school I got into the bad habit of making many derogatory ""jokes"", remarks, and using many choice words with impunity about just about any race, creed, etc, with some of them going way too far to be some ""edgy teenager humor"". These were days I genuinely never really looked back on, and having to face my past like that really bummed me out. Aside from the shame, I genuinely feel like it's pointless to continue on with my own life.

The logic in my mind is, since they're private messages that can't be deleted, they'll stay there forever, and some odd years in the future, either the recipient, or some data leak of some kind will expose these messages to the world, which would in turn, effectively ruin me, both via social destruction, and personal shame. If that's whats coming for me, then whats the point of building up a life? I've just been so caught up in both the anxiety for my future, and the shame of my past, that everything's just gone to a standstill. I'm somewhat behind in my studies, and i've noticeably been withdrawing from my social circles. I just cant face any of them now remembering what I had said.

Aside from every horrible thing i'd said (which I don't believe I can ever make up for), I absolutely regret ever going onto social media in my youth. While I can't entirely blame my conduct on social media alone, it absolutely gave me a faucet for exposure to these horrid things. I don't know if I would even give myself the option of suicide, either. To me, i'm unsure if I'd want to do it simply to run away from the social downfall, or as some sort of messed up ""apology"" for the things I said. I don't know if this is genuinely just a matter of forgiving myself or what, but either way, it's been an extremely bad position for me in the past month, and it'll probably be like this for the rest of my life.",08May2020,1
57,"Hi there! I'll get right to the point. I've basically been having frequent panic attacks, weird intrusive thoughts, and an insane amount of dissociative symptoms over the past 2 years. 

I've seen multiple doctors and they all want me to start on some SSRIs (namely, sertraline) to help fight the anxiety. They don't really think that psychotherapy would help since it's a little too severe, apparently.

My objection to this is/has always been that I'm scared that the drugs will permanently change who I am as a person. I mean after all, it literally rewires your neurochemistry in a way to feel more happiness by increasing serotonin. What if I become too dependant on them? What if there are long-term effects that haven't even been studied yet? 

I really do want to get better and take them but I'm basically too anxious to even take anxiety meds if that makes sense. Has anyone experienced anything similar? How did/do you overcome this?",08May2020,1
58," Before you read this slight TW I do mention cutting and suicide 

This is purely a vent, as you can see from the title, no one in my life wants to hear me

I have been dealing with mental and verbal abuse from my parents for years, and only 5 years ago did I actually see it was affecting me horribly. But for the past 3 years I’ve been dealing with (undiagnosed) depression, cutting, and major suicidal thoughts. The thoughts and the urge to die and cut  haven't been so strong before and they're taking over my mind and thoughts basically everyday and have been for the past month, only growing everyday. I can’t speak to anyone in my family about this knowing they will tell my parents and I will be sent back to a therapist that I don’t trust. I would suggest my own therapist but my anxiety of confrontation and just speaking against my parents is so bad that I almost get a panic attack thinking about telling them. I have no idea of what to do anymore in my life since I’ve basically become a husk of someone that died inside of me, keeping the lie and smile on my face for years telling people I was “fine”. I feel utterly stuck and have no clue as to why I keep up with my parent’s bulls\*it, only to remember that they made me to be dependent on them, with all of their manipulation and how they raised me. I can’t just suddenly leave everything behind and live on my own.",08May2020,1
59,"Hello! This is my first reddit post and im writing this past 12am, so please excuse my grammar (and any unspoken rules i might break :( )

So, to start this off, i guess i should give a brief summary as to why im here.

Ever since social distancing started, i've been noticing what appears to be a steady decline in my mental health.

In addition, many things have been happening this spring.

So, due to a bunch of symptoms appearing, im trying to find a proper diagnosis for what i have, seeing as i can go forward from there.

I suspect in all honesty that i have ADHD. My brother has ADHD (hyperactivity spectrum), so it is very well genetic.

Ever since i was a little girl, i've had very difficult times concentrating. My caretaker would have to snap me out of my long gazes while we did homework.

Im still plagued by this today. At least once a day, my body enters an almost trance-like state. Im spacing out hardcore, my mind is blank, i kinda sound high to be honest, and sometimes i cant even pull myself out of it. I usually have to wait it out or really try to get back.

In addition, the more i attempt to concentrate on something, the less i get done. I probably have chronic procrastination at this point.

This stuff is getting to the point that my grades are going to start dropping. Im literally not made for online school.

In all honesty, there are three things i really want to address via these reddit posts. This will be the first, and i'll bring up the other in the next few posts.

Again, i know this probably isn't the place to ask this, but im really not in the circumstance to get help from a therapist or psychologist at the moment. So, if anything, i'd like some casual opinions. :)",08May2020,1
60,this is kinda hard to explain but i did something a few years ago that i think is a large reason for a lot of my depression or at least that adds to it and ive never talked about it with my therapist but i feel like a really guilty person and i  hate myself and it makes me want to hurt or kill myself to think that i was so stupid to do this thing and i feel like a bad person but i don’t want to tell my therapist because i feel like she’s gonna judge me and i don’t want my parents finding out (what i did isn’t illegal or anything i just feel really stupid). 17f need advice please.,08May2020,1

1. I’m scared they will see me differently. Not worse per say but they will an avoidably see me in a different light. 
2. Ive has friends confide in me and sometimes it’s too much for me to handle and makes my anxiety worse and I’m scared I’m going to cause that to happen to someone else. and I don’t want to burden them with that. 

But it’s getting really bad and I need help but I can’t make myself reach out to anyone. And I don’t know what to do.",08May2020,1
62,"Hello everyone. First off I hope you’re all safe and healthy.

This will be a very long read, so bear with me.

This is going to seem like a minuscule issue at first but I really advise you to read through. For a few years now, I’ve had this issue that has been brewing up to a point where it becomes difficult to live daily life. Basically, over social media (could be anywhere but social media is the direct source) I become extremely upset and off-put when somebody insults something I enjoy doing, something about me, one of my friends, basically anything that is a part of daily life for me. This wasn’t a huge issue when it first started, I assumed it to be normal. But then I would end up getting into endless debates online that could last for days. I have plenty of hobbies and interests I enjoy (or used to enjoy) doing. I’m a Lego builder/enthusiast, fan of Star Wars, Longboarder, I just finished up 11 years of Karate, I play tennis, Mountain Bike, was a huge fan of Nintendo, etc. I could list more if it helps. When I saw someone online insulting those things, or anyone who enjoys them it really compelled me to reply. I’m generally respectful at first too when I reply. But then scrolling over a few comments became 20 over time. Then 50. Then hundreds. Eventually it got to the point where I would scroll through a certain number of ads or posts on Instagram, and had to check all comments on every single one that related to me. I also have a system I use to determine how many ads I scroll through. From the first ad, I swipe up and let go to see what I land on next. The goal is to land on another ad, so that the post itself is perfectly lined up with the screen. Ads that take up all of the screen do not count. If I do not land the scroll perfectly, I must repeat until I do. I’ve likely scrolled through hundreds of thousands of comments throughout the years. If I find a post that is a bit more personal, I save that post and check all comments every 3 hours or so. That’s just Instagram. We’re also talking youtube and reddit.

For youtube, I mainly see videos that I like. Occasionally though, I will find a large youtuber talking about a topic that is personal, and I will scroll through many of the comments. When I get a notification or reply from the vid in question, I return, and upon my return to that video I must sort by newest comments first and check every single recent comment that has appeared since my last visit to that video. Currently, this is going on for probably about 10 different videos. 

Reddit is a more recent case...and arguably one of the worse ones. I made my account in January, and for a few months stayed in subs I liked. But then I discovered r/consumeproduct and r/soyboys . These subs generally poke fun at things I’m into. Now, every single day I must check all new posts from these subs, and re-check every few hours to fish out comments. This is unfortunately evident by my comment history, if you want to take a look. The rate of posts on soyboys is far lower, so I don’t check that as often.

Another thing - On my phone I actually have a folder of screenshoted comments that were...upsetting. There are 800 in one, and around 300 in another. I can’t just forget about them. That would be willful ignorance. I probably won’t anyway, because certain phrases and usernames have been engraved into my mind and I go into a “shut down” state whenever thinking of them.

Now this is the worst part. The effects it has...The worst effects started appearing around fall of last year. When I get a notification from somebody who replied to me, genuine fear, and possibly anger flow through me. Rush of adrenaline too. This is no exaggeration- To me, the feeling is equivalent to just finding out a family member has passed away. That’s how bad it is. When I end the night arguing with somebody, I fear waking up. I don’t WANT to wake up. I don’t want to look at my phone or get out of bed. But I have to. I am not kidding when I say I would rather go take a vaccine at the doctor’s office, or have the sudden urge to throw up than read new replies. I would rather have the Coronavirus if it meant I didn’t have to go through a living hell again. Some nights, I am unable to finish homework. When school was active, I could not focus in class, either because I was on my phone or thinking about an argument I just had. More recently, I would just crawl in bed and lay down for an entire day. No will to do anything but keep my phone beside me and wait for it to light up. Not even talk to friends or family. Some nights I stay up until 4AM anticipating the inevitable comment reply, and feel that nightmarish rush of adrenaline kick in. Since then, I have fully abandoned Nintendo games, and my switch has sat on its dock for 5 months untouched. Lego is now something I don’t do as often. While still being a passion for me, I usually only do it when a considerable amount of time has passed since I last saw a comment about it. Sometimes I even close my collection room door to block it off. Disney? Oh yeah. My family loved the Disney parks, it was a major highlight for us. So many fantastic memories, including last year when my Symphonic Band went. If Covid doesn’t hit too hard they might go next year too. Will I go again? NOPE. Thanks to Qanon conspiracy theorists, I feel nothing but guilt when thinking about it. I don’t want to go there anymore. I want to cancel our Disney+ subscription. I hate everything about it, but at the same time I feel the constant need to defend it. Things I used to love are now things I hate. I cannot live like this. Every day is a living hell, and nobody- not even my own family, not even me, seems to know what’s going on. I’m quite literally a shell of my former self. My friend circle is trying to help but they do not know how. They seem worried too and have problems of their own so I don’t blame them a bit. Please, does anybody have any bit of advice? Anything they can share? If you made it this far thank you for at least making it through. It was a long read. I just feel like this post might be my only hope before things get worse.

73,"Okay, quick intro, I'm 27m my fiance is 30f, we have 2 kids (no more details about them I try keep them off and away from the internet). We're from the UK, and have been together for 6 years this July. 

We have each other and that's it really. Her family has pretty much abandoned her. Mine too aside from my mother. Neither of us have many friends, I myself have 2 or 3 I would call mates, none of them close to chat to. 

I always struggled with talking emotions, so much so I nearly pushed her away like everyone else who's been a part of my life. I have serious underlying trust issues that have affected our relationship in a negative way. 

Ive always felt worthless/useless/nobody is bothered. Lately because of the Pandemic I've felt extra useless, I'm an aspiring concept artist... recently picked up this dream and I've never been one to draw, until recently. I feel I'm learning slowly, and have seen improvements already. My mother has a degree in fine art, and she is near enough blind.

I've got a load of demons, but my main one was my self esteem. Yesterday my fiance told me I was gorgeous, and I believed it for the first time in 2 years. I cried a mixture of happy tears and sad tears. Overjoyed that she sees me like that and that I finally believed it and like she wasn't just saying it to cheer me up and whatnot. 

I'm still largely broken (pretty much). But for the first time in my 10-11 year battle with depression and anxiety, I have a little positivity and I am in a mindset to start tackling my demons head on. 

Don't know how this will go for me overall, but maybe the part of me and my mental state/health that is still negative is preparing me for the worst here. Anyway I wanted to share this on here, through the constant stream of negatitivity you tend to see regarding mental health, here is one with some positivity.

I'll also mention I did hit rock bottom, I tried to end it, I came back from that and slowly fixed myself. I thought it was done with but my problems crept back up on me, and I plunged back down to the pits after the birth of my children.. Which confused me and made things worse because I had no reason to feel bad. I should of been the happiest ever, but I'm guessing most can agree that it really doesn't matter how much you have, it can still be there.

Anyway, after yesterday, being the first day in around 2 years where I've genuinely believed that I'm wanted. It's a start, it must be... I've been getting so stressed with everything and feeling low that it shows in my art. My advice to anyone though is to realise what your dream is, and actually try to pursue it, if you make even a little bit of progress, you might feel better about yourself (like I did), and it might give you that little bit of drive (like it did for me). 

I went back to college (trying to improve myself - bored of warehouse work - chasing my dream) I'm doing game design (hence the concept art). The pandemic has us working from home where I'm sat around uninspired, and was getting stressed looking at my work after 10 minutes and not being happy with it. After my fianceto me, I sat and drew on my digital art tablet, and came up with the first drawings I was at least happy to include in my work. 

I hope that everyone who's ever been in a dark place can read this and understand that it will be ok, that you will get back to yourself one day. It can be a long battle, that some people are in and out of throughout there life, but just hold on and one day you will find your reason to start believing you can do it. It might not be in the form of love/a partner, it could be anything. And I really do hope you find it. 

I don't know how reddit works. I'm a ""long time lurker"" I think the term is. But if people need a chat, my messages are open, If my story or the messages coming from it helps one person it was worth sharing to me.

74,"I don't know whats wrong with me. It feels like everything at this point.

I've felt this way for years. I'm not sure when it started but I know it hasn't stopped since. The suicidal thoughts and the constant questioning of reality. I know about dp/dr, but it doesn't even matter if I know about it because I can't do anything, if thats even the problem. I'm living less than paycheck to paycheck and rely on handouts from my and my boyfriend's family to get by. Affording therapy is out of the question, and even if we could, my boyfriend probably needs it more. We keep saying ""When things get better, when we have more money, we will go to therapy"" but that's not going to happen.

Every day I question more and more if I'm ready, if I'm at my limit. Almost every night I have horribly realistic nightmares, or dreams hell I don't know anymore, where I feel like I need to wake up, and I wake up to another dream, i guess, that just feels like reality. I keep 'waking up' over and fucking over and every single time I wake up it feels like its real, like this is the new real, but when do I 'wake up' from this? When do I wake up from this one and find out it was all just another realistic dream. Everything feels fake around me, like I can't trust anything I see. Ive got things I enjoy, I love my friends and my boyfriends and my dogs and my mom, but I'm scared. I just want everything to feel real again and I'm worried it never will. I'm worried im just on the edge of 'waking up', like someday im going to look at something wrong and wake up and this will all have been a dream. I can't remember most of my childhood anymore and im only 21. I cant even connect to highschool, hell, I can't connect to two semesters ago of college. Even yesterday is blurry. The memories are sometimes there but its like its someone else, like they are fabricated. I'm so ready to give up. The only thing that keeps me going that I feel like I can trust is music, I always know the lyrics to my favorite songs, whether I remember learning them or not. I'm compiling a playlist of my favorite songs, the ones that bring up the most good and nostalgic feelings, nostalgic for what I don't know, but I'm compiling them to a playlist. One day I will play them all and at the end of it, well, I'll end it. Maybe. I don't know anymore. I keep listening to a few songs while driving and thinking ""I could run off the road right now and be content dying this way. No one would know it was on purpose. Just a freak accident."" I know whats stopping me, I know I want to stay, but im so sick, and im so so tired. I just want to feel normal again. I want my dad again. I miss him, and everyone else. The ringing in my ears is deafening from how loud I've been playing music for my entire life so I can feel something, some kind of connection to anything.

Maybe this is just a low. Maybe this is just a dip before things get better. I don't know, but I'm so incredibly tired. I don't want to be selfish and take myself away from others, I just want to feel again. I want to wake up.",08May2020,1

79,"So, idk if it's the whole quarantine thing + online schooling + online work thing thats kinda triggered it or what, but recently my breakdowns (which I would typically get every month, or just over a month or so) are getting worse? Like, not necessarily more frequent, but when they happen the anxiety from them sticks with me for days and seems to trigger like mini-breakdowns just before I go to bed. I'd rather not mention the subject of the breakdowns, but I've started getting nightmares from them too, which really is new.
- For anyone wondering, no, I've never seen a psychologist or therapist about any of this, but I have minorly discussed it with my GP.
- The irony of this, is I'm a psych major, but when it comes to my own experience I can't make sense of crap.
- Idk exactly what answer I'm looking for, but is it a thing for anxiety and stuff to be worse at night? Might it necessarily be caused by something else?
- I also have clinical experience as a sleep technologist, and I know some circadian rhythms and disorders can cause anxiety about sleeping, but thats not really the problem I'm having. I don't necessarily have sleep schedule problems and I follow sleep hygiene rules very closely for this reason. My anxiety about other personal subjects just seems to get so much worse at night as of recently.",08May2020,1
80,"Since about 13 I’ve felt this way, now I’m 21 and it has gotten worse. I constantly judge myself in my head and can’t seem to stop the thoughts that are in my head. I often think people are out to get me. Sometimes I think my food is poisoned if I lose sight of it for a while. Sometimes I believe certain delusions for example; I’m the only person that really exists and people are just in my imagination. It’s really hard for me to laugh even if something is funny. I’m not emotionless as I can still feel sad and mad. If I am tired enough sometimes I’ll hear people that I know talking in my head but literally talking in my head like they are sitting inside my head(only happened 4 times) 

I made a list and these are my symptoms that I have
* Persistent, repeated and unwanted thoughts
* Urges or images that are intrusive
* Compulsive or ritualistic behavior to get rid of the thoughts
* Delusion
* Flat affect- lack of emotional expression
* Disordered thinking
* Inappropriate reactions
* Phobia
* Lack of pleasure or interest in activities
* Buzzing in ear 
* Numbing of body
* Depersonalization or obe  

I feel that I am becoming dangerous to society and i don’t want anxiety/paranoia anymore. My mom has bipolar disorder so maybe it’s something genetic?",08May2020,1
81,"This is my first post on here. I’m a 27 year old male. I need help. I have wrestled with depression and anxiety for over 10 years now. I got married in my early twenties to a woman a few years older than me. Things quickly spiraled. She physically abused me a few times, lied and kept secrets from me, embarrassed me in front of family and friends, manipulated. Her relationships with her parents and siblings are fractured due to lies, verbal and sexual abuse, divorce, and much more. I feel like I entered the relationship trying to help her rebuild and now I’m the one who’s more broken.

I often get really overwhelmed and my thoughts race and I feel really hopeless. I have panic attacks and sometimes get suicidal. I rarely get close to doing anything though. 4 years ago after my wife tried to strangle me, I left the house overwhelmed with emotion, got on the highway and started speeding, contemplating running myself off the road but I never did it. I told my marriage therapist and wife about this incident. They were both sorry to hear but nothing came out of it. 

Nobody would believe me if I told them this because I’m successful in most areas of my life. Even my marriage looks perfect on social media. But, I feel like I’m dying on the inside. Like I’m losing my mind and becoming a person I don’t recognize.",08May2020,1
82,"For the past five years I’ve battled with depression. Early on I felt it the worst, I had thoughts of suicide and I separated myself from everyone who I loved and cared about. Over the years, I began to slowly understand my depression, but still succumb to it. I would have happy days/weeks/months, but at the end of the day I would still be alone with my thoughts at night, and it would all come back to me.

I finally saw a therapist, but it didn’t help very much, even though I really tried to give it my best effort. I believe one day I will try therapy again, but I don’t feel like trying again so soon after it didn’t work out. 

Recently, even with corona going on, I’ve been in a limbo, and after reading through some posts, I can tell I’m not alone. As people are stuck inside with their own thoughts, it can be hard, even though your daily stresses aren’t as high.

My problem is that I have been trying to control my thoughts and work on my mental health during this time, but I feel lost in my life. I am on a career path that was chosen for me by my parents. They paid for me to go to college and get a great degree at a respected university, but I don’t feel like I’m on the right path. I enjoy what I’m studying in school, but I don’t think it’s what I want to do for the rest of my life, and at this point I typically hear two things, either “you only have one life, do what makes you happy” or “take a semester/year off and decide what you want to do” and both of these don’t work for me.

I don’t know what makes me happy. I’ve spent every night for the past five years trying to focus on the things that make me happy and often times it just comes down to the people closest to me. I don’t seem to have any passions or goals or even really hobbies. Thus, I don’t really have any careers that excite me, unlike some of my friends who have had dreams of jobs they’ve wanted to do since they were a kid.

I guess I ask you, if you are still reading, what would you do if you were me? If you had no goals or dreams in life, but you were on a path you didn’t necessarily want to be on? 

I can’t leave the path because that would require choosing another path, and I don’t know which path I would even pick. However I can’t stay on the path I’m on because that’s a life wasted.

Thank you if you read this far, this is my first time posting about my mental health publicly on the internet.",08May2020,1
83,"Let me explain. Going through this sub and another mental health-related sub, I've come across several posts talking about how dumb therapists are and that they don't help at all and they don't care. 

Well... what do you expect. We can't even help ourselves, how do we expect them to do the exact thing we happen to want them to do? They don't control how they are taught to help people.  

Indeed, therapy doesn't always work for everyone, but you can't put absolutely ALL the blame on the therapist. 

I'm not saying you can't complain about therapists, if you meet a terrible therapist, then you should complain about it. You can criticize the therapist's methods and how they try to help you. My issue is when people call therapists ""fucking idiots"" and because their therapy didn't help. 

Anyway, this is kinda just my opinion about posts harshly criticizing therapists. I get it, our mental health care system sucks, but why is everyone just so harsh on the therapists.",08May2020,1
84,I have been anxious since childhood I’ve never gone to bed worrying someone was going to harm me in my sleep it’s very troublesome. As I grew older the same worries spread to most things in my life. My parents don’t particularly believe in mental health and until my girlfriend broke up with me snarked at me trying to find someone to help me get better. Now my girlfriend and I broke up after heart for years we met in highschool were each others first in a lot of ways. Towards the end she said I was too Paranoid and wasn’t trusting. Even tho she was the only person I did trust fully. She broke up with me Because I became too much to deal with.... even tho in the same text she said she was one of my biggest enablers your not get help. Not to sound selfish but I gave her my whole life i work as a sales agent and am very successful doing it. I gave her a roof food and love every night for 4 years and she couldn’t even tell me she was breaking up with me I found out through a friend. I just feel worthless and like a gaint piece of shit for being able to change faster.

86,"I want to start out by saying I know everyone has their own mental issues to some degree. I am a childhood sexual abuse survivor so I have a ton of my own. However, something about my friend feels off. 

He constantly has extreme mood changes where certain times he’s extremely happy then next thing you know he’s so down and starts to abuse alcohol and weed. He also has this thing where he has extreme pet peeves when he hears people eating, no not annoying chewing that I understand, where he has to physically leave the room when he hears utensils hitting the plate or if certain food makes a certain sound when a person eats it even with mouth closed. He also needs constant reassurance on everything always asking if what he did was okay or if any of his actions would result in horrible outcomes, most time tiny actions such as how his voice sounds when he speaks. 

He is also a very hateful person, the most hateful that I have ever met. He can recall in detail, and still does it randomly multiple times a day, the things someone has ever done wrong to him even from an age as early as 7 and he wishes those people were dead. Something as simple as someone looking at him wrong he well lash out by saying that those people are idiots, just are jealous, he will point out and magnify their flaws, and say how he is so much better and smarter than them. He is extremely fixated on material things and if something tiny were to mess any of his things up he would get extremely upset and mentally shut down. 

These are just some of the few things I can think of. He is a very smart and capable person but his personality seems really off to me and something on the inside is telling me something isn’t right about this dude. Could you help me pinpoint what exactly might be going on with him?",08May2020,1

91,"Hi. I am 34M and have had recurrent depression and anxiety following a motorcycle accident in 2004. Following the accident i spiralled into a severe depression and made an attempt to take my life by taking 3 boxes of tramadol. Safe to say it didnt work. When i was in the emergency room the condemning nature of the doctors was a true eyeopener. One doctor even refued to treat me because of what i did. 
After 2 years of intense physiotherapy and psychiatric care i was able to walk and function again, to a certain degree anyway. 

From then like many late teens i got in with the wrong crowd and started taking a lot of recreational drugs. This lasted around 3 years and ended very abruptly with all my so called friends refusing to talk to me and spreading lies around. In the end my parents ended up moving house 40 miles away from everything i knew and naturally i followed. It took me 6 months to overcome the dependance and cravings but i did it! 

Fast forward past that and ive been sitting in a lonely bedroom alone for 6 months with no one to talk to and no social outlet whatsoever i ended up walking to the next village and met some people who sort of befriended me, however time would tell that they were never interested in being friends and just wanted to use me for my car.
Anyway, one day me and one lad went to meet some girls as 20 somethings do. I ended up meeting a girl who became my wife.

At the time she was 18 and i was 21/22 and things moved very fast, this was the 1st time i had been intimate with anyone. We ended up moving into my mums quickly and both ended up working in the family hairdressing business. We still work there.

Over the past 12 years we have had 3 children andlife is as stressful as you may imagine. I do love my wife and kids, they are the reason i am still alive. 

Throughout the past 15 years i have developed an intense paranoia that people are out to get me, well specifically the wife. A few instances where ive heard her say something to one of her friends and i MAY have heard something different than what was said. 

Several times i have i think created intense thoughts that she was trying to harm me. One time i was so convinced she ordered her 2 brothers to kill me on the friday at 5.30?? That i would sit and cry in the car and just have to wait and see if i got killed. Wierd i know! Then nothing ever happens. My wife if always the same. We snuggle on the sofe, we do most things together and these thoughts are NOT normal.

To overcome these feeling i decided to stydy pharmaceitics at university as a means of distraction and unfortunately after 8 years of study i have found myself in the same mentality and have burned myself out and my thoughs are not right.
This started in my 3rd year undergraduate year when i was so convinced my wife was meeting people from univeraity to make me look like a laughing stock. I should say i had never mentioned any of them to her so all a little odd in hindsight.

Lately i have been having very intense thoughts that my wife (all while been the same person as always) has been elaborately cheating on me to hurt me.
I got so convinced she slept with my dad that i was going to kill myself so i didnt have to face the years of already spiralled trust issues that were my nes normal.
For the last 3 months i am convinced that she slept with a couple we have drinks with and now im convinced everyone is laughing at me. This hurts extremely as they are the only friend i have.

When i hear people talk, sometimes i hear something else. Its not like i have misheard them its like my brain changes it to hurt me. 
I have recorded conversations to reassure myself that it was me and not everyone else. I do realise how mad that sounds.

I know i have some mental health issues and have been very reluctant to tell my dr about the extent of it due to a fear of been sectioned. I need my kids and wife. 

Since the pandemic started i have started shaking all the time and the dr has put me on beta blockers which have slowed my tremors and on carbimazole for overactive thyroid. The dr has said she will phone me every tuesday to make sure im ok. (She is a very nice doctor and she assured me a hospital stay would not be necessary).

Now heres the problem:

I cannot tell if i have been paranoid or if things have actually happened.
I cannot confront my dad as he is happily married and would destroy my parents marriage and i have asked my wife about the threesome and she got defensive saying not this again! Dont you trust me??

I have been contemplating suicide because of this and i keep crying. I shouldnt have these thoughts when we have little kids. But they are really well looked after and are oblivious to all of this. 

My wife knows i am paranoid as a result of the bike accident and my past where mri scans show damage to my prefrontal cortex, which i am told affects mood. 

I really need someone to throw a line and pull me from this swamp of dispair so i can move forward.

92,"Sorry, I’m not quite sure which sub to post this in, but I would love some advice on this situation. 

A friend texted me today while she was having a panic attack asking for tips on how to get past it. I called her and helped her breathe through it, but she hung up after a few minutes after getting her breathing *slightly* more under control. She stayed on her phone to read the texts I was sending her (about continuing to breathe, clear the mind, relax the body, etc). At this point, she was still crying and struggling to take deep breaths, but was no longer hyperventilating and feeling dizzy. She texted me about how she thinks she wants to die and that she hates herself, and that she has been feeling this way for a long time and doesn’t know how to stop feeling the way she is. I asked if she was feeling suicidal at that moment and she said she was currently conscious enough of her thoughts to know not to do it. She kept mentioning that if it “weren’t for breaking her parents’ hearts” she would. I believed that she wasn’t going to attempt suicide at that moment so I didn’t call for help, but told her that if she started feeling unsafe, she had to tell me or tell her parents. 

I asked her if she knew what triggered her panic attack and she said it came on randomly, with her suddenly feeling a sense of suffocation and chills, and thinking about how much she hated herself. She then sent me a long message about the ways that she feels like a failure and feels inferior and not enough, and I told her all the positive and amazing things about her and how much she means to so many people. She said she hated reading that because it felt like I was lying to her. I know her emotions were dialed up to 100 during this time and I just wanted to get her thoughts away from hatred and negativity, so I said that right now we just need to focus on the breathing and relaxing, and we can address all the other issues later, one step at a time. 

Eventually it got to the point where she laughed at something I said, and it helped her stop crying and pick herself off the bathroom floor and into her room. I asked her if she wanted to sleep it off or if she wanted to video chat, and she decided to vid call me. We talked normally, didn’t mention anything relating to what just happened or other mental health topics, and we talked for hours. Our conversation felt completely normal, exactly what is typical of one of our usual conversations (and we are best friends so we always have a big laugh when we talk). 

I’m just a bit unsure at this point what to do. My thoughts are to get her to see a psychologist, but I don’t know how receptive she will be to that idea/if there will be difficulties due to COVID-19 (probably would have to be a video appointment at home but her parents are home, and no one will be able to keep her accountable to go to that appointment). I do think it is important for her to see a professional though, one way or another. (Btw, we live in the Bay Area in California). Aside from that, I’m not quite sure what else I can do for her besides continuing to check in on her, so I could need the advice on what steps would be appropriate and helpful here. 

I am completely taken aback by this. She has been my best friend for 10 years and never did I even slightly suspect her to feel this way. She said tonight she has never told anybody about this before, so I am the only one who knows. Thank you in advance for any help or insight anybody may have. ❤️",08May2020,1
93,"I thought we were taking mental health seriously and without stigma these days, ha!
This is my first foray into seeking mental health treatment, nothing too acute, but it’s building and I need help making sure it doesn’t get out of hand and I’d hope to make home life better.
I’ve become increasingly concerned about my child as well, ideally this process would focus around 
1 my child 
2 my relationship with my wife 
3 my wife and myself individually

In that order... I think, maybe I need to switch 2 and 3.

I’m broke and on Medicaid, options are SLIM or so it seems.
I have a decent primary, he seemed a bit concerned when I asked for the referral, turned out I didn’t need it, they gave a “self referral”, just a piece of paper with 4 places listed on it, only 2 accept Medicare but literally all 4 are methadone/sub clinics.
I’m not looking for that!
I guess that’s what “clinic” means in my state now
But ok... I try the first one, I made 7 trips total.

In retrospect I think my primary knew my options and wanted to tell me but he’s basically hobbled and can’t help.

So I go for it! Nothing to lose... or so I thought 

 I got 30-45 min waits, junkies come in, sit maybe 3-10 mins, go back and get tested, sit another few minutes, go back and dose and leave.... boom boom boom, fast as they can herd them thru!

On my entry visit I met with the head doc, turns out he’s just the dealer, all drugs including psyc meds go thru him even tho all counselors are licensed, able, and do write scripts for patients in their own private practice.
Anyway, first visit took 1.5 hour just to see the guy and him to see what drugs I want (none I think, certainly not opioids which is his whole racquet.)
It’s a total racquet!

Next visit was to meet my counselor, I didn’t expect much, I didn’t get much, paperwork and tests was most of it.

I did happen to mention I was looking for tools to communicate better and advice or how to do so, she looked at me sideways and says “ I do not give advice” very sternly, kind of threw me off and was off putting.
She informed me they do 30 min visits until you establish a rapport with your counselor.

On the next 5 follow up visits I waited as usual, as people come on go, all happily paying cash and outta there quick... when I’d finally get called back ti the counselor she never remembered my name or case, I’m not sure I even looked familiar which is hard to believe if you see me! She would then proceed to have me copy by hand ( I took pics ) YouTube links to self help people while she rummaged thru her files to find my thin little folder, then she’d have more paperwork for “us” to do, just stupid bubble tests that score you and did not help one bit other than to learn that I scored way too high or low and that was not good, then she’d tell me how few options there are fir people in my position.
We’d then talk for maybe 10 -15 mins, nothing constructive at all, then she’d rush me off for the next person.
Honestly I think she may be a decent counselor but I KNOW her case load was massive, she was new, had her own office etc.
I always asked about 1 hour sessions but was misdirected each time.
After 5 visits of this I go to make my next appointment, they want me back the NEXT DAY to duscuss “drug options and concerns” I think, It was a mandatory visit with the drug dealer doc and I was somehow behind, monthly meetings with him, I told them I didn’t need to come back tmrw, I’ve made no progress and even tho I’m anxious enough that I literally can’t breath at times I’m still only interested in drugs if I have some confidence they’re appropriate, these people knew nothing about me or my needs, they weren’t drug testing me, there was no concerns.
I asked to speak to him that day, after a lot of hassle I did speak to him, he’s was literally playing on his phone, set it down to chastise me and patronizingly explain a lot of garbage and even tho I told him I had no concerns they insist that I make an appointment for the very next day, it was “very important and mandatory if I wanted to remain in the program “

I said no, they said that’s direct violation... but I get 2 chances ( lol $$$$)
I said “no thanks, you’re not bilking my insurance for this”
It was a lot of money even if it wasn’t mine, and this place was clearly a money mill that was not interested in mental health.

My 2nd experience wasn’t much better, basically all the red flags of the first place, but with a 45 minute, traffic filled drive, to a fancier place where everyone seemed more snooty than the first place.

Flash forward to now and things are not better in my life and I’m now much more concerned for my child and my relationship than I was before.
Lock down brings it to a head, which actually suits me just fine!
I want to deal with this but everyone needs to be on board.

So!
I had a zoom meeting with another dope clinic employee counselor she gave a full hour, took notes, remembered or write down all names involved.
We even talked about how weird it was that she worked at a clinic like that and how I was never discussed in her school etc, exchanged personal numbers.

In short it was a much better experience, it was only the entry visit so my expectation isn’t too hi, but she’s calling back after only 4 days, is talking about things like group  or family visits, which sound great!
And also home visits which make me very self conscious, I’m super private introvert, I don’t like strangers or even family in my space, much less coming in and checking up on things.
I like have weird interests, odd plants add botany/biology, guns, I have African masks all about the house it freaks people out and then they judge you, I get enough if that based on the way I look.
My wife did home visiting for education and there was so many dcbs nightmares that it really freaks me out despite the fact that I’m a fairly upstanding responsible person and I adore my child in a way I didn’t know existed before I had her... there’s really nothing to hide, except some messes I’ve procrastinated on too long, but there’s nothing to show off either, we will just see where that goes, I understand it allows them to see more of the household dynamics and what not.

I have a lot of questions and even more concerns with this going forward, my past experience has been so bad I’m not eager to do that again, and now I’m involving a fairly young child, the goal is help her, not make some terrible memory or experience.
I know therapy is not always positive for people, I know that very well first hard, it can be very negative in fact, especially for a child!

Does anyone have any thoughts on anything?

Am I thinking about things all wrong somehow?

Does the bad experience sound typical?

Should I be concerned about my child taking to a counselor? I really think she should.

What about couples counseling for the wife and I?
We need it too but I’m not sure she’s on board... I’m not so sure about anything with her these day, it’s scary.

If I have nothing to hide then should I let case workers in my home? That seems almost wreckless given what I’ve seen.

I’ve found that there are very few resources available to me locally, but as I go on, swallow my pride and ask for help I’m finding more options, Can anyone suggest any other reasources I might find in the real world?

I’ve looked online, it’s downright overwhelming!
I’ll take all the help I can get, if anyone has links then I’m open to them!

I’m open to any advice or criticism... or just chat... this is uncharted water for me, I’m very self conscious so I scrutinize myself a lot that’s not always a good thing, I often find myself overthinking little things and missing really big important things... if I’m missing something, please clue me in!


Thank you very much if you even read all this.

If you happen to stop and think, give some advice or something then thank you even more.

Well, I like the idea of meditation. Of being able to sit aside and just rest the mind for few minutes since I have it working the whole day, why not just give it some rest. I also like the feeling of peace in the present moment. That I am not hurting and if I am, at least I can focus exactly on that spot and see what I can do about it. Its liberating to know that pain is either in the future that we are worried about or its in the past and its the memories that we are suffering or hurting from. Yet, I keep procrastinating and postponing my meditation sessions from ridiculous reasons. I am guilty of it. But then again, my brain would start coming with excuses like: “you know meditation is useless. I am only improving because I am journaling my thoughts and getting it out of my system by writing it down” , “meditation is not a necessity. Its a habit and I might get attached/addicted to it.” Which thats what we literally working against: attachment and addiction to things/habits/feelings. 

How do I fix those intrusive thoughts and enjoy my meditation in peace?

My mom keeps telling me over and over that she can't wait for my brother and I to move out. My brother was an accident, but she says she had me because she felt like she had to, because two kids is a normal number. She says she didn't want to wait to have me because she wanted kids living at home for the least amount of time possible.

She talks about how jealous she is of people who don't have kids. She says she wishes I was gone. She laughs, and says all of this in a joking way, but she says it often enough that it has to be serious.

She used to say it occasionally, but she's bored now. She has nothing better to do than tell me she never actually wanted me.

She keeps telling me she wishes I wasn't around. She says she wishes I would go away so she could sit on the couch (even though there are two). She says I talk too much and she doesn't like my shows. Every time, she laughs it off, but I know she's serious.

I don't feel like I can speak up about things and I wouldn't want to as I don't feel like things would change for the better, they'd just dislike me. The kind of things that get to my mood - FIL possibly has ADHD and lacks social skills to read a situation and I often get trapped in inane, mindless, one-sided conversations with him and he doesn't listen so just speaks over me. The house is filthy and very cluttered with paperwork etc, FIL and BIL aren't ""house trained"" e.g after eating a packet of crisps they'll tuck the wrapper under the sofa for instance. FIL is a heavy smoker and the smell constantly wafts into bedroom window (even at 3am as he has a weird sleep pattern). BIL is a wanna-be DJ and pot-head, constantly breaking lockdown rules which infuriates me and my OH but FIL does nothing about it and he thinks he's invincible. We've been buying the weekly shops and getting requests for household (to minimise time spent in shops) yet they take little trips to shops to buy themselves extras (which we'd happily buy for them). Obviously financially this has impacted us too. And there's lots of petty things irritating me that I know I'm being ridiculous about such as they always empty their bowels at 4/5/6am really loudly and slam bathroom doors and bedroom doors. 

I've lost all my mojo and find sitting with them at meal times etc so painful and now I'm just not making any conversations and trying to avoid eye contact for fear of finally exploding at someone or bursting into tears. I feel rude and guilty but I just can't find that extra bit inside me to pretend like I normally would. I've tried getting up before them and doing yoga, working out... I go on walks and try to keep in contact with my family but nothing seems to be long-lasting :( 

I've got family stresses too and lots of other things going on but the main thing is I just hate this living situation but I know it can't change as we can't afford to.",08May2020,1

100,"PLEASE BEAR WITH MY LONG STORY... ESPECIALLY IF YOU EVER TOOK THIS DRUG INCONSISTENTLY FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU!!! 
I knew little to nothing about antidepressants but was in a tough season and experiencing depression SO when I went to get my ADD medicine refilled, I asked my doctor if I could take anything for it or what to do. 5 minute convo and he just prescribed me 75 mg Effexor and gave me NO information or instructions so I blindly started taking it. I took it consistently for a few months... it was okay but being a newlywed the night sex drive was kinda a deal breaker. Then being naive (but also the fact that I’m not a routine person and i’m very forgetful) I didn’t really like how it would make me nauseous when I took it if I didn’t eat soon enough and just hated the way it made me feel in general. So.... I just didn’t take it most days. I did this for two years (at one point I did tell Dr. I wanted to get off so I did swap to 37.5 mg.) I would just take it inconsistently, take it then skip anywhere from 2-5 days and start taking it when I started to realize “Oh maybe I’m not feeling good because I didn’t take that medicine” 🤦🏽‍♀️ I’m not a WebMDer or googler so i never thought to look up the way I was feeling I just knew I was feeling off and more depressed than ever (obviously now i know it was withdrawal symptoms). I had the brain zaps, nausea, sweating while sleeping, foggy brain, but other more extreme things that affected me and my marriage: sleep paralysis (that junk is scary), irritability, fixation on things and not being able to move forward, overthinking, uncontrollable emotions, trying to control situations and fears, and even aggression. I naturally, and definitely before taking it have a very easy going, go with the flow, peaceful temperament so this was very out of character for me.

Fast forward to right now... things exploded and my husband ended up walking out of my last month. I casually brought up to my counselor that I took Effexor very inconsistently the whole two years I was married. He was the first person to educate me on how extremely unhealthy it is to take Effexor inconsistently and thinks even still the drug probably wasn’t a match for my chemical makeup and thinks a lot of the emotional issues on my side of the marriage were attributed to that. 

Currently hating myself for being so irresponsible and hating this drug for what it feels like, ruining my life. I don’t know how likely it is that this drug was the sole reason for behavior out of character but I feel like it played a huge role. When I realized this, I stopped taking it cold turkey 13 days ago. It has been HELL but I want nothing to do with it because of the effects it had on me. I feel like a different person. I can’t say I’m the best i’ve been because I’m unbearably sad but gosh, I can think so clear. My emotions are not all over the place. I am reasonable and slowly getting back to myself. My problem is: in attempt to reconcile my marriage, my husband is not going to just accept that inconsistently taking a drug impacted me that much to act so out of character for two years so I really just want to hear for other people that have possibly taken this drug inconsistently for a long period of time and how it impacted them?

Some other questions: 
- Did taking it inconsistently have lasting effects? 
- Did you ever become physically aggressive when that isn’t a response you’ve ever had in your life? 
- Did you ever experience sleep paralysis? Is this a known side effect of Effexor? (SP: Being asleep and dreaming but feeling like you are awake and unable to move or breath)

Thanks for reading my diary entry 😂 All of this to say, please don’t be as stupid and uneducated as i was to take this powerful drug inconsistently for a long period of time. It can very well hurt you and the most important people in your life. 💗 And if it’s not the drug for you, you CAN get off of it and survive the terrible withdrawal, frands. Will answer any questions about that you may have too!",08May2020,1

107," Does anybody have the same problem?

I am generally quite a positive person but of course, like anyone, I have negative emotions now and again.

I have a close group of friends but I actively avoid talking to them about things in my life that make me sad. It's because they generally end up trying to make me see the positive, a few don't really share when they are feeling sad and others aren't very communicative.

I thought I had a good group of friends but now just feel very alone. I think it's because my friends lack empathy - they're not very good at saying ""I totally understand how you're feeling, that's totally valid"". In one conversation, a friend basically told me our other friends' situation was worse so I should get over it. I basically end up feeling quite guilty for even feeling sad about certain things.

Do other people actually have empathetic friends who are good support systems? Are there any internet sites or other support tools that may be helpful? I do feel lonely to be honest and don't really know where to vent my negative feelings.",08May2020,1

113,"TLDR at bottom. Wednesday was my 20th birthday, and for some reason I was really under the impression that things would be better. But things aren't getting better, and I'm not talking about Corona. If I'm being honest, I say that I want Corona to go away, but I'm only really saying that because it's the right thing to say, but I know that I don't believe it. I just don't want my normal life back. The chaotic environment we're all a part of now seems somehow way more manageable than whatever the fuck was going on before. And besides, people have less time to hang out with me, so it all works out, and that's not sarcasm. Recently all I've wanted was a day. Maybe 2 days, but I just need some time where noone is talking to me, noone is asking me for my weed, noone is asking me for backrubs or to play video games with them, and noone is telling 3 hour stories about something I don't care about. I hate faking interest but I will to make you happy. I'll do anything to make you happy and it's killing me. I decided to get my first apartment ACROSS THE HALL from one of my best friends for some reason. Surprise surprise. I come home from work, sit down, and my door opens with my friend in toe. He doesn't understand that I just need to rest and whenever I tell him he says ive been avoiding him and are starting to hang out with him less. If I refuse to play video games with him/go to the store/say hi to his pet, he basically just won't leave me alone until I go. He'll just shake me or gently kick me nonstop until I get up. Not to mention that he's too worried about keeping weed in his apartment (understandable, it's a smoke free complex) but he has no issue leaving it at my apartment in the same complex, and just coming over 35 times a day to come smoke. I don't have privacy. Everyone just uses me. This one time my coworker asked if I had any weed on me, and I said yeah. He asked if it was cool if he brought this other worker, I said no because I'm almost out and my S/o hates too many people in the apartment at once. When he showed, he completely didn't listen and brought the other coworker too, and this coworker has no respect for me. Literally yesterday I got off work, and she said ""OP I'm gonna go to your house and take a chop"" when I asked what she meant, she just said that she'll be over 20 minutes after work.  When I said that it might not work out, she just said she'll make it quick. Now I have no weed. Because everyone but me keeps fucking smoking all of it. I haven't even smoked like at all in the past week because I've been working all the time, and when I get home it's always fucking gone and I have to buy more bc my S/o got laid off due to Corona so they've been home alone a lot, and also my friend comes over to smoke my weed, and my co-workers do, and my S/o does, and basically what I'm saying is that In a week i spend $150 for about 2 bowls worth of weed, I pay $750 a month for an apartment that I can't lock and isn't a home because people will want to come over. I work 40 hours a week with people who only fucking use me. I haven't wanted to tell a story or share thoughts or think much as all or anything lately because I've been everyone's dump bin lately, and people have just been telling me lots of really heavy shit lately without considering the fact that I might just not be in the right mental space for it. I have really bad bipolar. People know this. Of course they don't give a fuck and tell me shit anyway. I don't even want to talk to my S/o right now I just want to fucking shoot someone for their weed to I can fucking smoke and then dip into the mountains until every crumb of it is gone. I just want to lock my apartment and have it be quiet without expecting a knock every 30 minutes, and it's not like I can ignore it. He'll just keep knocking until I open it and if I say I'm tired or just need some time or something like that, he'll just say ""not good enough"" and pull me out anyway. Why can't people just leave me alone. Why the fuck am I the neighborhood tool. Why the fuck am I the dumbass who gives away weed and money. I just want to be able to truly have control of my finances rather than being expected to buy the weed for all my friends and s/o. Why am I so stupid. I work so much. I film videos for pornhub (the only place people are respectful) My friend doesn't even have a full time job and he's 21 with a fucking life and a girlfriend. He seems happy. I just want to cry. I fucking hate this life and whoever decided to let me be born has a really fucked up version of ""funny"". I am walking pain and I WANT TO CLAW MY FUCKING FACE OFF KILL ME I KNOE THAT I WILL NEVER PURPOSFULLY TREAT ANYONE BADLY AND I FUCKING HATE THAT ABOUT MYSELF. I. WANT. TO. DIE. 


TLDR noone respects my space, my home, my thoughts, my finances, my worries, basically I'm the family doormat. My only following is on pornhub.

114,"When I open up, people’s first reaction is that I self diagnosed myself. Not many people know that I see someone and take medications. But still, if I say I have depression, your first reaction should not be “don’t self diagnose”. Diagnosed or not, if someone is claiming it, they must have needs. And I see people saying “omg all these people are self diagnosing” makes me think, did those people really self diagnosed or did people assume they did like people assumed of me? 

When I told people I had OCD their first reaction was “self diagnosing at its best” eye roll with a very *condescending* attitude. One girl straight up told me I don’t have OCD and that I don’t know what it is.

And even if someone is attention seeking, maybe there is a reason they are. They might be neglected at home, have self image problems, and other things. Ask them how they feel and listen to them.  Ask them if they are seeing someone and encourage them to seek counseling. 

It’s okay if you ask about it to redirect them but what I see most of the time is more of a dubious and condescending attitude.",08May2020,1
115,"Over the past year (I would say starting in about September of 2019) I would have a LOT of speaking anxiety. I mean I used to always get nervous before I would do a speech or something, but since september, I would realize what I’m saying as I’m saying it and then I would get very anxious and lose my train of thought. I even get nervous when I’m just talking to family members sometimes. It’s actually gotten better since around October (it was VERY bad then) but I still have it. Yesterday, I had to give a presentation on zoom and I was SWEATING. My heart would race very fast and I could just feel my nerves tense up. I guess I’m just afraid of messing up, but I don’t understand why I get so nervous it’s just so annoying.

The funny thing is that in high school I would barely get anxious (im a freshman in college right now). For example, in my theater class in junior year, I had to memorize Shakespeare and give lines. I probably had about 40 or so lines and I did it pretty perfectly. However, in my theater class in college I only had to memorize about 10 lines of Shakespeare. This was around October 2019 btw. I was just so nervous. I messed up once (still got an A thankfully) but by the time I sat back down my hands were tingly and I think they fell asleep. 

I’m not sure if this has to do with self esteem or something, but I feel like when I feel confident it’s easier to talk to people. I feel like I care too much about what others think. I’m trying to care less, but it’s just hard. Because how can one physically care less? I am a caring person by nature, but idk. It’s just weird that I’ve been having this speaking anxiety a lot recently while it’s never happened in the past.

Also, since starting college I feel like it’s been very hard to hold a conversation. I think it also has to do with the speaking anxiety but I just don’t know why my brain can’t function and come up with words. I’ve found that writing papers has also become more difficult. My guess is that social media is just taking a toll on my mental health because I’m very self conscious and don’t want to ever say anything wrong to possibly get “cancelled”. Okay I’m ranting at this point, but does anyone have suggestions to maybe feel less anxious? Thanks if u read this all :)",08May2020,1
116,"A bit of a tw at the beginning
Some background info: I'm a 17F. I've been through bullying to the point of a failed sus*de attempt and se*ual ass*ult. I have severe stress, anxiety, depression and PTSD (this is all according to my school colunceror, who is helping me in these times). 

My parents refuse to take me to a therapist because they believe that mental health is ""a bunch of baloney made up by democrats to take your money"" (ik, I don't get it either). I have suggested essential oils instead of pills (one of their fears is me becoming stupid due to taking any pill thats meant for mental health) to help reduce my stress and anxiety, but they refuse to get them. They have also told people that I reach out to for help that 'Im mentally ill and that I make things up to get attention from others', and then severly punish me for trying to get help.

To make a 7 year story short: my parents have been mentally abusing me for years (excessive and ugly name calling to the point of tears, severly punishing me for things I haven't done, talking down about me behind closed doors, blaming me for their mistakes that happend over 20 years ago, constantly comparing me to other people, and etc). 

My parents have never hit me (unless if I'm being punished). I don't think they need to hit me because they know that their words can hurt me a lot.

I was recently forced out of my house and locked outside all day because according to my dad ""I didnt get all my chores done"" (i got all my chores done and I was working on hw for online school) and ""I have a disgusting attitude."" I couldn't go inside to use the bathroom or get food/water or else dad would start throwing things at me, cussing me out, and calling me ugly names. I was finally let into the house 10 minutes before my mom got home so that it'll look like I was in thr house all day. I also had my first panic attack back in Janurary, and my parent's were the reason why it happend. It felt like I was going to die. I didnt talk to anyone for days and my parents took this as an offense and punished me for it.

I have tried to tell my mom what my dad has been doing to me when she's at work multiple times. She'll calm me down and say that she'll go talk to dad about it, she'll go to dad and he'll say that I'm lying to get attention. Recently, mom will laugh at me and says, ""Why would i believe you over my husband?""

It's mainly my dad that is causing all the problems with me in the house. Especially with quarantine going on, it's gotten a lot worse. I've gotten advice on how to try and fix our relationship, but no matter what I do, my dad is still causing problems.

So i adviced him just to relax and just not to make a big deal out of it, but he got a little offended and said mental health is not a joke and should be taken seriously.

This reminded me of a few months back when there was a camp at my uni for mental health awareness, it was free of cost and had a licensed psychiatrist present there. It was free and id never been to one before so i thought i should attend it.

She was quite friendly and helpful so we talked a bit, and she gave me few tests regarding depression, social anxiety, self esteem and anxiety. So i gave all the tests, took me about 20 minutes, after that she analysed all the tests and kinda looked at me with a pale face. 
I asked her about the scores she behaved in a weird way and said, that i should immediately see a therapist or it could be fatal for me later in life.

 I was freaked out, not gonna lie but i thought it was a setup for hooking up students for pointless therapies to suck up cash, because i wasn't feeling sad or anything like that.

Now that my friend has mentioned this, I'm kinda getting freaked but at the same time confused because i still don't have sadness or anything else like suicidal thoughts.

119,"So I grew up with a horrible deformity, and it was really hard.

I was constantly mocked, bullied, beaten and rejected because of how I look. So I barely had any friends, barely had any relationships - the ones I have had haven't last very long at all, I've been told I'm ""hard to wake up and look at"". 

Can't go swimming, the gym, the beach anything involved not being fully clothed from neck to toe. Excessive sweating causes inflammation and pain, so it hurts to excises and I got really fat. I hated it, obviously, and that made me sweat just as much which made it painful all the time.

I was forced to make myself bulimic and then Anorexic as soon as I could and now I ""suffer"" from Anorexia because not eating tons of food is the only way I can keep my weight down and not be fat at all.

This has completed skewed my entire life from 99.9% of people I've ever met in my entire life. The only people who are actually open and know exactly what I'm talking about are other deformed people. Most people don't want to you know *you*, they just look at you with pity and try and let everyone know how awesome they are for hanging out with you.

I'm nearly 30 and while now I don't get openly mocked or beaten because I'm not in school, I get constant dirty looks off strangers, children screaming or crying or pointing when I walk past.

And people just don't understand it. They've never experienced anything close to it, I've never experienced anything otherwise.

From what I can remember the dream was, I was in a hotel room packing up my things the leave when about 5 young lads (about 18/19 years olds) come in shouting and unpacking their things and throwing rubbish out of the window. I ignore them for a bit until I say something about them littering. Then they all look at me, walk to the window and jump out of it. Then they come back in and it just repeats.

It lasts days, and sometimes weeks, and can prevent me from doing most things that I enjoy.

Silence is the worst, I've had it when I'm laid in bed in silence and this comes around and it just feels like I can hear people shouting, but quietly somehow, and it can lead me to getting really worked up and a little afraid sometimes.

I'm not sure when this seems to happen but it's been with me for years, I can remember it happening to me as a kid 10+ years ago, and it definitely stopped a lot but it comes back occasionally, and it's usually times when I am feeling pretty spacey already like when I'm tired or the time it just happened (which led me to writing this post) was right after having a cigarette which hit me pretty hard and spaced me out a bit (I don't think it's related to smoking directly though as I've only fairly recently started within the past \~6 months)

Long story short, since becoming a father almost two years ago, as expected any negativity relating to children *really* hits me hard. Not just news, but even historical events 100+ years removed, or episodes of TV shows.

A few examples that had particularly stuck in my head **(trigger warning, spoiler tags below)**:

&gt;!General articles about the deaths or suffering of young children due to neglect or malicious acts from adults. Even just the titles get to me.!&lt;

&gt;!Historical accounts of the sinking of the Lusitania, a passenger liner, in 1915 by a German torpedo - resulting in the loss of many women and children. Read this in book three of Edmund Morris' trilogy on Theodore Roosevelt. TR speaks to this in one of his famous speeches while campaigning for Hughs in 1916, pointing out Woodrow Wilson's failures: *“There should be shadows at Shadow Lawn; the shadows of the men, women and children who have risen from the ooze of the ocean bottom and from graves in foreign lands; the shadows of the helpless whom Mr. Wilson did not dare protect lest he might have to face danger; the shadows of babies gasping pitifully as they sank under the waves…Those are the shadows proper for Shadow Lawn; the shadows of deeds that were never done; the shadows of lofty words that were followed by no action; the shadows of the tortured dead.”*!&lt;

Black Mirror spoilers: &gt;!The episode where police can check people's memory for evidence of crimes: a woman kills an investigator who was about to uncover evidence in her memory of a crime she had committed, then goes to the investigator's home because her family would be wondering where she is, and kills the husband. She's about to leave when she notices a toddler in the crib and is afraid they'd see her in the toddler's memory, so while it doesn't show anything thankfully, she ends up killing the toddler - implied based on later scenes with the police - who tragically ended up being blind unbeknownst to her anyway.!&lt;

Possibly the worst one stuck in my head: &gt;!News article on Google News about how a mother had hung her two young children in a basement closet by plastic dog leads.!&lt;

&gt;!Overall, any situation where an infant or child (presumably anyone unable to care for themselves) has placed their trust, or had trust placed with someone to care for them and that person had betrayed that trust.!&lt;

I try to avoid the news whenever I can, but I also like to stay informed on things like the election and general happenings. I read Factfulness by Hans Rosling recently which helps use statistics to demonstrate that the world is improving by pretty much all measurable metrics, regardless of the negativity spread by media. When negative thoughts come, I try to remind myself that my wife and son are healthy and we're all together - give them a hug, etc - but it only does so much.

Anyone have any additional tips on unsticking these negative thoughts from my head? Part of me wants to pursue this as a purpose and maybe start a nonprofit or contribute in some way to do what I can to stop future atrocities, but that's just an idea at the moment.",08May2020,1

150,"Final year uni student.

Long story short. Last year, I failed basically every assessment. I went into the year in a bad mindset and failed two exams, one bit of coursework, and a project worth 50% of the grade. It wasn't until after the project that I looked for any help. But I was basically too scared to look for help, and spent an entire year feeling like I was messing up. This began to result in panic attacks, waking up in a wild panic every day, horrible mood swings and eventually some rather negative thoughts _(I don't know if I'd call it suicidal thoughts, but I would constantly think things like ""eh, whatever, I'll cross the road now and if I get hit by a car, I wouldn't give a shit"")_.

I still don't know exactly what that was. I call it a mental breakdown. Since uni was stressful as hell, and death was a frequent occurence. My granddad had died that year, as well as a great aunt I used to visit very regularly before I went to uni (once a week). Two years beforehand, my little brother had committed suicide, and I lost my dad fifteen years ago to lung cancer. I kept saying ""I'm 22 and how many fucking funerals have I went to"".

I ended up getting prescribed some anti-depressants but I never took them, I don't know why, I didn't want something messing with my head. And even then, it was a battle to get that much since I'm kinda reserved and hide a lot. I had to. My mum was the first one to find my brother's body years ago and I just couldn't bring myself to collapse then. It's probably not a good idea. But I hid my own feelings for a long time. I knew who had it worse, and I couldn't bring myself to break down given that.

This year, I'm retaking that year I failed. First half of the year went fine, well even. My lowest mark in an exam was a 60% and one of my coursework submissions was as high as 85%. Overall, I was set for at least a 2:1. Potentially a first-class degree if my project pulled up the grade.

But then, a fucking epidemic happened. I was already nervous about the project. It fucked me over last year and now I had to face it down again. At first, I was being careful. I attended every meeting in person. I kept myself inside of the uni to keep myself doing my work. I was scared, I felt like things were a bit shaky from the get-go after my supervisor was changed last-minute, but whatever. But the lockdown hit, the university shut down. My workflow was screwed up and I found it harder to speak to people to get help. I don't know anyone here. Most of my friends already graduated and I find it difficult to make new friends, since I feel out of place. I ended up doing other things. Random crap, stuff that might help out maybe, or distracting myself. And now, I'm well and truly fucked.

I feel ashamed of myself. I had a turnaround ready. I was going to turn last years failure into a grade I could be proud of. Now I'm going to fail again and I can't help but feel like it's my fault. Most people learn to work with the new circumstances, and I couldn't. And that's all my fault.",08May2020,1
151,"Shortly before the outbreak of the corona virus, my father booked a holiday in a different country. When corona broke out, the flight was cancelled and he waited to get his money back. It's been like 3 or 4 weeks now, and he has not got it back yet. This is really unfortunate and I see why he's angry at that. But today, he called me because the police came to his house and wanted to arrest him, but then did not do so for reasons unknown to me.

First, he put letters on the door of the travelling agency, calling them scammers and liars, which is a really bad idea on its own. But then, he called the travelling agency and said ""If you don't give me the money back, I will come to your office and take you hostage until I get my money back"". This, of course, started criminal investigations, but he's unwilling to take a lawyer and to excuse for this stuff, ""because Rambo also did not excuse"".

For all my life, he's been a great Rambo-(and Stallone-)fan, only taking his life lessions from these movies. He was always very keen on sports, doing bodybuilding and so on, but this is the first time that this really brought him to a dangerous situations that he will certainly lose. As silly as it sounds, but he more and more believes that he is kind of a Rambo character, who's been treated badly by the world and now wants to revenge for this. He even said that he'll fight this until the end, ""just as Rambo did, no matter how much damage will be done to myself or to others"".

He does not believe that he actually is Rambo in the sense that he was in Vietnam, his name is John etc., but he believes he fulfills the exact same role and that this is a good role model to life by, fully unavailable to rational arguments and anything that may change his mind.

He's never been a clever guy, but he got along well enough not to get into serious trouble. But this is really threatening. When he called about the police coming to his door, he laughed at it and did in no way take is seriously, because ""he's like Rambo"".

I live like 500 km away from him and since corona rules are very strict here, I cannot visit him. Is there anything I can do to stop him from destroying himself even further? Or do I have to witness this act of self-destruction and visit him in prison the next few years?When he called about the police coming to his door, he laughed at it and did in no way take is seriously, because ""he's like Rambo"".My father has a Psychosis, what can I do?",08May2020,1
152,"As seen in[ Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/balanced/201908/bipolar-disorder).

Bipolar disorder is a relatively common affliction that affects as many as[ 2.6 percent ](https://www.nami.org/learn-more/mental-health-conditions/bipolar-disorder)of the U.S. population, if not more. It is also within the top 20 leading causes of disability globally and leads to a higher rate of hospitalization, suicide attempts, and completed suicides than major depressive disorder. Despite its prevalence, bipolar disorder is difficult to diagnose and misdiagnosis is extremely common. In fact, the mean delay between its onset and correct diagnosis falls between [six and 10 years](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X18301949?via%3Dihub).

The inability to properly diagnose bipolar disorder is largely due to its similarity to unipolar depressive disorder, a condition also known as clinical depression or major depressive disorder. A study that arose from the initiative Bipolar Disorders: Improving Diagnosis, Guidance, and Education (BRIDGE) found that, of the 5,635 participating adults who were believed to have major depressive disorder, 903 fulfilled the criteria for bipolar disorder. In other words, [16.1 percent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21810644) of those involved in the study had been misdiagnosed and were being treated for the wrong condition.

**What is Bipolar Disorder?**

“Bipolar disorder” is an umbrella term used to describe a cluster of afflictions with a similar symptomatology. They also all possess a strong genetic component. Within this group of conditions, one finds bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, cyclothymic disorder, and less common forms of the disorder, some which can be induced by substances or medical conditions.

Patients who have one of these conditions tend to alternately experience episodes of depression and episodes of mania or hypomania, which is less severe and/or protracted than an episode of mania. Depressive states are characterized by low mood, lethargy, apathy, and anhedonia (loss of feelings of pleasure). Manic states are characterized by feelings of elation, increased energy, and reduced need for sleep. Additionally, individuals in the throes of mania oftentimes have an inflated sense of self-esteem, engage in reckless acts (such as rash investments, impulsive shopping sprees, excessive substance use, or risky sexual behavior), begin numerous complex projects simultaneously, and can feel as though their thoughts are racing at such a frenzied pace that it can be difficult to speak in an organized fashion.

According to DSM-5, individuals with bipolar I disorder experience at least one manic episode that lasts at least one week and is present most of the day for nearly every day within this period of time. These episodes are frequently bookended by periods of hypomania or depression, but neither hypomania nor a major depressive episode is necessary for a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder.

The DSM-5 states that individuals with bipolar II disorder experience at least one major depressive episode in their lifetime that persists for at least two weeks, as well as at least one hypomanic episode lasting four days in which symptoms are present most of the day for nearly every day. If the episode is determined to be manic, rather than hypomanic, the diagnosis is bipolar I disorder.

Cyclothymic disorder is typically less severe than either bipolar I or bipolar II disorder and is characterized by alternating periods of elevated and depressed mood. However, at no point does the elevated mood become mania or hypomania. Similarly, at no point does the depression qualify as a major depressive episode.

**Telling Bipolar Disorder from Major Depressive Disorder**

Distinguishing a depressive bipolar episode from major depressive disorder poses several diagnostic challenges, as the symptoms are almost identical. One study even found that only [20 percent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5858935/pdf/nihms949464.pdf) of bipolar patients in the midst of a depressive episode were correctly diagnosed within their first year of seeking treatment.

Misdiagnosis is particularly common when the onset of bipolar disorder begins with a depressive episode. Though the patient may eventually experience either manic or hypomanic episodes, this is not apparent to medical professionals when they make their initial diagnosis. Consequently, they lack the necessary context to recognize that the patient has bipolar disorder and not major depressive disorder.

Yet another reason for frequent misdiagnosis is that patients with bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder tend to experience mania or hypomania infrequently when compared to depression, and, consequently, are far more likely to seek the help of a medical professional while in a depressive state. One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12044195) found that patients with bipolar I disorder were symptomatic during 47.3 percent of weeks, and that 68 percent of symptomatic weeks were characterized by depressive symptoms, 19 percent of symptomatic weeks were characterized by manic or hypomanic states, and 13 percent of symptomatic weeks were characterized by cycling or mixed symptoms. Another [study ](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Long-term-symptomatic-status-of-bipolar-I-vs.-II-Judd-Schettler/03c61f776ba6a1c9ca51de16b5077dda652e10cf)found that patients with bipolar II disorder experience symptoms more often (55.8 percent of weeks) with an even greater prevalence of depression and a significantly lower frequency of either hypomanic or cycling/mixed states. During symptomatic weeks, patients experienced depression 93 percent of the time, hypomania 2.5 percent of the time, and mixed/cycling symptoms 4.5 percent of the time.

This tendency to seek help while experiencing a depressive episode may also be the result of a more willful [reporting bias](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5858935/pdf/nihms949464.pdf). On the one hand, many patients may not report the experience of manic episodes that are either short-lived or lack severely reckless behavior, largely because they do not recognize these states as being part of a larger illness. Patients may not even know that they are experiencing hypomania or the kind of subthreshold hypomania characterized by cyclothymic disorder. This is especially the case with creative or artistic patients. They may be under the impression that the “creative juices” are merely flowing more readily than normal or that their lack of sleep and increased energy are due to their excitement about a project or series of projects.

In other cases, patients may perceive manic episodes as a positive experience and may not want to give them up. They feel on top of the world, full of energy, and ready to take on any task. Unfortunately, such a boost in self-confidence oftentimes leads to incredibly dangerous behavior. Manic patients may inadvertently drain their bank accounts, irrevocably destroy relationships, and run afoul of the law.

**Why Misdiagnosis Is Dangerous**

Misdiagnoses can be dangerous for several reasons. Perhaps most obviously, accurate diagnoses allow medical professionals to better treat the underlying condition, no matter what it may be. This is as true for mental illnesses like bipolar disorder as it is for any other kind of condition.

Even if some symptoms of bipolar disorder overlap with other mental illnesses, most notably clinical depression, the two are not the same and should not be treated as such. Of equal importance is the fact that effective treatment options for bipolar disorder vary from those for other conditions, and prescribing pharmaceuticals meant to treat another affective disorder may exacerbate some symptoms of bipolar disorder and cause more serious manic or depressive episodes.

As mentioned in a [previous post](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/balanced/201904/test-bipolar-disorder), there have been advances in using biomarkers to diagnose bipolar disorder and, one day, medical professionals may be able to regularly rely on objective means of testing for numerous mental illnesses, not only bipolar disorder. However, at this time, the most widely practiced method of diagnosing bipolar disorder continues to be the observation of observable signs and the self-reporting of symptoms from patients.

To ensure that patients receive a correct diagnosis of bipolar disorder, it is crucial that they share any family history of the illness when being examined by a medical professional and report any symptoms of hypomania or mania, not only depressive episodes. By sharing this information, they can prevent any long-term deleterious effects of misdiagnosis.

Furthermore, patients who know they have bipolar disorder or believe that they may potentially develop the condition due to family history or genetic predisposition should have an open line of communication with a mental health professional whom they trust and who is attentive to even minor changes in symptoms, as sudden modifications to treatment are often necessary to ensure effective treatment.",08May2020,1
153,"Been struggling with ADHD and maladaptive daydreaming disorder all my life. I have an INCREDIBLY low self esteem. No one in the world to support me. I just don't want to live a life of suffering anymore. My grades are usually average/low because of which I get taunted very frequently. My family verbally abuses me for being the way i am. And when I told my mother that I'm struggling with some mental illnesses, she humiliated and criticised me, saying that I'm making dumb excuses for my bad grades. Called me names.  She also said that she is so incredibly ashamed of me because apparently visiting a psychologist for help indicates that one is insane and abnormal. She threatened me to keep my mouth shut and not go around talking about this because according to her people would want to get rid of me and ultimately people would be afraid of being around me if they got to know I am struggling with mental health issues . Said she found herself incredibly unfortunate to have an idiotic loser like me as her child .  I know it's all bullshit that she's saying but i couldn't stand up for myself. I genuinely don't know how I'm gonna fix myself while being surrounded by such toxic bigots.",08May2020,1
154," 

I've had a history of depression and anxiety/social anxiety for the last geez 10 years.

The last 5 years I have been medicated...Effexor and Wellbutrin and last year i was regularly seeing a therapist, but i guess I hit my limit on sessions thru Kaiser so they won't see me for at least 6 months. Which i think is bullshit, but that's a whole other thread.

As for everyone, this lockdown hit me in a weird way. The first few weeks were just adjustment and a little scary but once I got into my new work at home routine and everything, I'd say the last month has been ok, maybe even a bit more optimistic. I work as a bookkeeper/tax preparer in a small office of about 6 people. They of course want to start having us come in regularly again and I would be ok with it kind of. I was also a nanny for this company, but when the child started school this past year is when I started my office work. I bookkeep for 20 small businesses and about 7 personals. So my plate is pretty full.

My lady boss is a workaholic, my man boss is the owner of the company. He's older, ready to retire in a few years, but also has his own mental health issues. He is also a raging alcoholic. So his schedule is usually wake up at 11, straight to a screwdriver and watches CNN all day and eventually will start ranting about the world. I love these people I really do, I've been with them for 6 years, travelled with them, etc. Plus he has 2 teenage kids that come every 2 weeks and they are out about with their friends everyday. I follow them on Insta. Now with everything starting to open up they want me to come back to watching the kid. and teaching him.

I do not want to teach. I don't have that kind of patience and i know it won't be beneficial to either of us if i did that. I'd watch him a few hours a day to play and exercise, sure but that's where i want the line drawn. I also do not feel comfortable being in the house all day with my man boss. i do not think that is going to be good for my mental health. It will also cause me to stress out because i won't have enough time to finish all the crap i have to do in the office.

So i don't want to come back. I'm happy at home working, and pretty productively i might add. I'll come in sure if they want me to, but everytime I talk to the mom boss she makes me feel guilty. Everyone assumes i'm scared to get covid. Sure it's in the back of my mind, but scared no. I feel weird being out, this is a weird time in all our lives. Why can't i feel this way?

Yesterday while talking to her she said you need a therapist. I was offended. I told my husband that I didn't like that she was saying that to me, and before he at least pretended to support me. He said maybe she's right. Why is she right? Because my feelings aren't like everyone elses. I'm not jumping on the idea of hanging out with an alcoholic all day and doing something that makes me feel uncomfortable?

I'm really upset that my feelings are being completely cast aside because she doesn't want to watch her kid and be stuck in the house with her husband, but that's ok to make me do?

How do i say that without being an asshole?

I know what will probably happen. I'll get guilted into doing everything i don't want to do, I'll fall behind in my office work, and then will stress out and be in the same position i was in about 2 years ago when the same kind of thing was happening...minus covid.

I just feel unheard, unsupported, and pretty much like everyone just thinks i'm crazy.

If anything this shit is making everything worse for how i'm feeling. I've been taking my in case of severe anxiety meds the last few days just knowing that this conversation is coming up next week.

Who cares though right, as long as they all get what they want. Drive me to the crazy house and drop me off.

Sorry for the rant. I don't know who to talk to and the person i thought was my rock (husband) i feel is turning against me. So i'd love some advice, thoughts, whatever.

155,"I have a fear of being left alone either at home or anywhere else really. I’m not afraid that something will happen to me or someone will break in while I’m at home..... Rather, I lose all motivation. I have a lot of hobbies and interests but when I’m all alone at home (counting down hours until my husbands comes back from work) I can’t do anything. I feel complete apathy. 
I can’t even be bothered to cook properly for myself and barely muster up motivation to brew coffee.
I feel as if everything is pointless and there is no need to do anything. This feeling is so strong that I end up doing nothing but watching YouTube aimlessly until someone I know comes home and is physically present. Then I go back to normal.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mental health history:** I'm in my early/mid 20's now and have had problems with anxiety and depression since high school. Starting in college, I had a fairly common story of ups and downs throughout. however, I always maintained a productive/healthy lifestyle while doing quite well to maintain my grades and be involved with friend groups and a few social/academic groups. Of course I still had days (sometimes weeks) where I would have a pretty rough cycle of depression where i wouldn't do much of anything all day. My anxiety started hitting me very hard starting in my junior year. This is when I first saw a therapist which helped me tremendously at first. However, things started going downhill during the end of my junior year and going into my senior year. I have a difficult degree which exaggerated the pressure and stress I was putting on myself. I wasn't able to keep up with my work and by my fourth week I pretty much lost all motivation/capabilities to continue going to class. It hit me pretty hard to lose a semester of work but I was still determined to pick it up and finish it over the next two semester. (At this point I was still doing research with a professor and had a fairly technical job)

**Persisting problems:** History repeated it self, however, and I kept having problems with my anxiety keeping me from going to class. It was hard to tell my friends and family about it because it was embarrassing, so I didn't. I'm used to figuring things out on my own and letting my own problems be my own problems. I felt like I was being lazy and selfish for not going to school. Money issues started to rear its head and added to my stresses. I lost my job so I wasn't making any money on my own (i'm very fortunate to have an alternate form of income but I was still struggling). I kept trying to go back to school and kept failing due to a combination of financial issues and motivational issues for the next year (Currently I'm nearing what would be the end of my 5th year). I never found another job because I was sure I'd be able to be better by the next semester (and losing progress kept sending me into long depressive episodes).

**Today's problems:** During this time I've retained a somewhat healthy relationship with many friends and some family. However, I haven't been honest with them at all with whats been going on. I've definitely drifted away from some over the course of the past year as I severely isolated myself for a good portion of the past year but I passed this off as being busy with school (many of them have moved away which has made it easy to stay separated but still friends while isolating myself). I never told anyone about my mental health issues and many of my closest friends and family have no idea that I haven't been going to school for the past two years or so. Now I have to tell them that I'm not going to be graduating this year (this week) and I don't feel prepared to do so at all. What kind of person are they going to see me as? I worry that they will hate me or pity me. I also worry that won't see me as a capable/intelligent/hard working person anymore. I know my family will be very disappointed in me (this will cause them financial strain). On top of all this, it's going to be very hard to get the funds together to get to continue school next semester, let alone pay for rent and groceries with the quarantine going on. All of this adds to my anxiety and has made it so I just cycle into depressive episode after depressive episode.

I know that I'm extremely capable of having a productive/successful/happy/healthy life but crossing this gap is excruciatingly difficult for me.  I'm still planning on finishing school but I'm worried about my anxiety just getting worse and even that terrifies me and makes my anxiety worse. Going back to school and seeing people I knew that are younger than me take the same classes and old professors seeing me having to take the classes again I know is going to be very hard for me. Its also really hard knowing that I'm still over a year away from potentially finishing school and moving on from this part of my life

157,"Ok this might be a really long and weird story so be ready. So I'm just gonna dive right into it. So this has been going on for a little more than a year now and has been impacting my life ever since. It's been impacting my social life the most. So when I was in 8th grade (I'm freshman now and things are still the same), I was in my physics class and I was talking to my friend. I don't know if you guys are familiar with stuttering and like speech impediments but that basically took over for no reason right in that moment. I started stuttering and trying to speak but really couldn't get the words out and I was frustrated and really confused of why this was happening. And also before you ask, nothing previous has ever happened. I didn't get a concussion or have anything physical happen to me. This happened out of nowhere, and I'm still confused to this day. Anyways this went on for like 5 periods straight I think and had a hard time talking to my best friend because of this. I told him for some reason I've been stuttering for basically the whole day and I don't know why. He seemed confused too and wasn't really into that conversation and moved on right away. So I told myself to not think about it so much and to just chill out. And it worked. I was thinking after that that it was probably just a small phase like how my brain is developing as I grow or something to do with puberty. And I was like I always have weird things happen to me like that and then I wasn't so weirded out by it and tried to move on with my life. So as you probably know, this isn't over yet. This problem actually kept coming up and disappearing over and over again throughout the rest of 8th grade, And mostly through summer as well. Lemme just tell you, because of this, that summer was the shittiest summer ever. So this kept happening and then I started to overthink to the point where I realized that I was trapped inside my own head and I started thinking about the most fucked up shit, and overthinking about the weirdest shit that no one ever even worries about. It felt like brain was wanting me to suffer and deteriorate into insanity until I end up in a mental asylum. It feels like there's a demon in my head controlling what I should think about and what is shouldn't think about. It got to the point to where my brain was telling me to hurt and possibly kill myself. Guys don't worry I'm sort of fine now and it wasn't as bad as it was. Maybe. Anyways I told my mom about this problem after a year passed. I don't know why I waited for so long. I couldn't cry or anything during this and while telling her this because I can't feel my own emotions anymore. This whole stuttering thing and overthinking problem has turned into some sort of intense GAD and SAD problem, except 20x worse. So I told her about this and it took awhile until I got a therapist but finally not too long ago I got one but because of this while coronavirus outbreak, I couldn't see her in person and I had to speak with her on the phone. I lied the first time when she asked me questions like if I want to hurt myself or hurt others because I said no. And then I regretted saying that to her. I told myself that I should just tell her the truth or I'll suffer more and it will just get worse. So then the next week I talked to her on the phone again and she asked those two questions again. I said yes this time. After I said that it seemed like she was talking to me like I was completely insane. And I'm not sure I might be, but I hope I'm not and I hope that this will stop and I was also hoping that she would give me some sort of medication. Then she said I have to tell my mom that you I'm thinking these thoughts. I gave the phone to my mom and she talked with her for like 20 minutes straight. Thankfully it was super nice of the therapist to not tell her that I'm thinking those negative thoughts, and that she just wanted me to do it. So she told us to get two types of medication from the store and she said that I need to see a psychiatrist. She said she would speak to me in two weeks. It's been more than two weeks and she hasn't spoke to us since. So the medication seems to be sort of working but I'm not sure at the same time. Some days it seems like it does some days it seems like it doesn't. So I've been taking that for a little less than month and I don't feel too different. I'm still sort of stuttering and thinking negative thoughts just here and there. Whoever reads this, can you please give me some advice or give me an explanation for what's happening to me? Thank you.",08May2020,1

Background: My 20's have kinda sucked. I watched my mother die a slow painful death, my fiance cheated, my sister shot herself, my boyfriend raped me, and I lost all four grandparents, two uncles, two aunts and a friend. Childhood wasn't great, my sister and I were molested by our elder sister, parents were alcoholics, we weren't beaten, but we weren't allowed to go to school, house burned to the ground when I was five, and food was scarce a lot of the time. So I'm not a Holocaust survivor, and I know many people have much harder lives than I do, but I've had panic disorder since I was 10. I'm at the point where I have two to three major panic attacks/flashbacks a week... I don't mean getting nervous, I mean vomiting and passing out intermittently for hours. I made one suicide attempt and regret it. That attempt left my body permanently and grotesquely scarred... I lost a third of my blood volume through my esophagus, so my regular vomiting poses a real threat.

I've been diagnosed with panic disorder, PTSD and major depression. Doctors refuse to prescribe me anything other than mood stabilizers despite the fact that I have never presented with symptoms of bipolar or mania. I have turned to alcohol intermittently to self-medicate, but I hate it. My therapist does not understand why I have not been prescribed at least a low dose of benzos for breakthrough panic or night terrors. I'm not looking to get high, I'm looking to get my life back. I have a reoccurring dream that I get a cancer diagnosis, and in that dream I feel total relief and elation, because it takes the choice away from me

162,"Hey everyone. I’m posting this in the hopes of getting some opinions or maybe just some words of affirmation. Here are some stats and medical conditions of mine: 
23yr old F
5’1 140lbs 
Conditions: gastroparesis, unexplained hyperemesis, PTSD, depression, anxiety.
I do see a therapist. I don’t feel like it helps me and I’ve seen 5 different therapists. 

In January I was taken off of my Zoloft 200mg because it was exasperating my gastroparesis. After weaning off, my physical health vastly improved. I’m talking being in the hospital over 60 times last year and averaging one admission a week, losing 35 pounds in a month, frequent jaundice from dehydration, hyperemesis style vomiting, ect, to not being in the hospital AT ALL after completely weaning off. My Gastroparesis symptoms are much more manageable and the only reason I know I still have it is pain after eating more risky things and frequent nausea but no vomiting. There were several points last year where I thought I was dying and I feel very thankful to not be feeling like that anymore. 

My husband and I are supposed to start IVF in July and thanks to my panic disorder, I constantly panic about the pain parts of IVF such as the hysteroscopy, 12 weeks of shots, and the embryo transfer. It’s so bad that I usually start panicking before I even open my eyes in the morning. 

On top of the panicking part, I’m so depressed that I haven’t gotten out of bed in 3 weeks except to cook and run the errands I absolutely have to. I’ve put off my lab work and going to get our embryo contract notarized (we’re using donated embryos and the process mimics that of a legal adoption where we have to get lawyers involved) for 2 weeks just because the thought of doing it feels suffocating. In fact, pretty much anything feels suffocating right now. The only place I want to be is on my bed, browsing reddit or just doing absolutely nothing. I’ve been in bed so long that Im having back spasms from constantly laying down. 

I feel like my Zoloft kept me from feeling this low but I’m terrified of getting back on it. As low as my mental health is right now, I think if my physical health ever tanked like that again I would probably kill myself. Not because I want to die, but because I can’t imagine feeling the type of pain I was feeling last year for one more second. Furthermore, I’m scared that the Zoloft will cause negative effects on my future pregnancy and baby, especially paired with my reglan that I’ll have to continue taking through pregnancy. I’m already scared of the effects the reglan could have, and adding the Zoloft will make me feel even more nervous and like a shitty mom before my child is even born. 
And another thing that keeps me from getting back on the Zoloft is the fact that my IVF clinic was overjoyed when I told them I got off of it. And every time I have an appointment the embryo coordinator always tells me that she’s “so glad I got off that Zoloft. It wrecks havoc on your body, especially while pregnant.” I feel like they would be disappointed in me if I got back on it. 

I’m feeling lost. I’m feeling depressed and suffocated. I’m feeling suicidal at times but I don’t want to die, I just want to stop feeling like this. Sometimes I feel like running far away and just disappearing. Sometimes I feel like self harming. Before quarantine, when I felt the urge to self harm, I would go get a tattoo. I got 13 in the span of 6 weeks and it actually helped those feelings a lot. I can’t do that now because everything is shut down. 

I don’t know what to do. My mental health is at one of the lowest spots it’s ever been and I feel like nothing and no one can help me. Getting back on Zoloft is risky for many reasons but I can’t stand feeling like this. Every minor inconvenience feels like a million ant bites stinging me and I bust into tears. (Example: when my dog barks, I cry uncontrollably because it’s so annoying and it feels like I just can’t take it)

I used to be religious, so at one point that gave life purpose.  But as a consequence of my agnosticism, I keep being mentally derailed by the transience of life and what philosphers called ""Absurdism.""  The fact that within a mere century everyone I know (myself included) will be gone forever is a crushing realization.  It's hard to find motivation in the wake of this eventuality--If nothing I can do will change the ultimate outcome, why does it matter what I do?  

I have a good job, but find it hard to focus anymore or find motivation.  I used to be incredibly motivated, but I just can't light the spark anymore.  Working hard on projects or assignments just feels like running a finite hamster wheel until my biological hourglass runs out.  I don't want to feel this way; I want to be a productive and positive member of society, but I don't know how I can do this with my intense awareness of life's finality.  I've talked to people in my life about this, but they usually just give generic truisms like ""keep your head up,"" or ""be positive"", which definitely have merit but don't really address the core issue.  I more get the impression that other people don't ponder this often, which makes it tougher for me since there aren't really people to talk to with any powerful insights.

181,"Finally accepting I need to do something. 
Hello sorry if this is long or muddled up or something. I’m just going to be writing this as the thoughts come to my head. I’m 22 years old and at the moment like a lot of people I’m really struggling. It all just boiled over as I was walking to the shower and my mother asked me if I’m okay and I just said yeah sure I’m just tired. When really I feel so alone that it’s literally paining me physically. I feel embarrassed writing this but in that shower about 10 mins before I’m writing this I broke down crying sitting in the shower and everything like the full works. I’ve always been alone. My dad for my entire life until he stopped around 2 months ago due to almost dying and almost causing brain  damage has always been an alcoholic. I can genuinely say I have no good memories of my dad. Whilst drunk he was always verbally abusive to me and my mother. I feel no emotional attachment to any of my family, even now in lockdown I haven’t had a conversation with my parents or brothers (I am not close to either brother it’s literally almost awkward when we happen to be in the same area in the house). I haven’t told anyone in person that I love them apart from my friends when drunk( who I truly love. They are literally all I have).  I love my mother more than anything in the world but even still we don’t speak I believe it’s because we’re all emotionally damaged from abuse from my dad. Also my dad is genuinely horrible he’s racist and horrible to my dogs and everything he’s disgusting. I also have no self esteem I have always hated myself and how I look. Since 14 I have had awful acne that I’ve never even tried to treat properly. I’ve bought some creams but I have literal acne all over my chest back and face and I haven’t been to the doctors or anything and I can’t understand why I’m like this anymore I hate it I hate myself I hate how alone I am. When I was 17-18 I was in a relationship with a girl who was just so horrible to me also. In hindsight I should have broken up with her a day into the relationship but it went on for a year and a half. She lived an hour so train away and was verbally abusive to me and also smacked me with a brush a few times. She would threaten to post nude pictures of me online when we argued and if I ever had a reason to be upset with her she would somehow flip it. She then cheated on me with the person she is with now. Happily with someone for 3 years while I type this up for Reddit. I’m fat genuinely hideous. I’ve tried changing it. I’m 5ft 6 at one point weighed 16st 5 and then went down to 12 and a half and have since ballooned back up. The only time i ever feel happy is when I’m high or when I’m tripping. I smoke weed all the time and drop acid tabs often. I feel it’s a way out and genuinely feel better when I do them but it’s probably harming me also. I work a dead end job I’m not happy with I don’t have any motivation to do anything more and no energy to do it because I see no point. Everything has been shit in my life and it all boiled over. Sorry I won’t read this back so I may have missed important points as I type frantically and I’m just too embarrassed to even be typing this up and telling people even though I’m anonymous. Don’t know what to do anymore I feel like I’ve given up. Also all my friends are all enjoying this time to at least become closer with family while I have gone further apart. It’s breaking me",08May2020,1
182,"Reaching out because I have absolutely no idea what is ""wrong"" with me (the title is made up, it might be a thing but I am not sure).

When I was growing up I initially got addicted to games like WoW, Runescape etc. I grew up a bit, and since I have been in the working world I have been addicted to many things - currently Poker to replace Golf and also the gym pre-lockdown.

I am an absolute ""Monomaniac"", I have one thing that I latch onto an obsess over it, all hours of the day, every day. Since lockdown, for example, I have played poker probably 12-16 hours a day, every day. When I could play golf, I would go to the driving range every lunchtime, practice in the garden, or play on Sat/Sun &amp; weekday evenings if possible.

None of this is an issue, what is an issue is that I get absolutely enraged by my addictions:

\- I lose a few hands at poker, i'll go on ""tilt"" spit my dummy out and rant to everyone I know about how it's always me losing

\- I hit a bad golf shot i'll get pissed off, and ruin my round by hitting a few more bad shots and then spiral into an absolute cesspit of self loathing

\- With the gym, I obsess by going a few times a week (as recommended) whilst ensuring my nutrition is tracked within an inch of its life.

The problem is, because I obsess over these things, play them so much, or study so much, I expect to be extremely good at what I do. But I am not 

\- My friends are better than me at poker

\- My friends are better than me at golf (though they practice less etc). 

\- I do look better after going to the gym for a few years but I would be fairly confident in saying I have merely got to an ""average"" body type at best, with no exemplary strength or muscular gains. 

This obviously leads to me feeling inadequate or a failure constantly. Or, frankly being in a foul mood because I have either, not achieved or exceeded my expectations in whatever it is I am addicted to at the time.

I need to re-wire my brain but have no idea how... Any help appreciated, or a point in the right direction as to whatever might be the issue . If any more information is needed let me know!

Thanks",08May2020,1

It's like I have a drink and all the worries slide off me and it's like my chest relaxes, it's not tight anymore. When I dont drink I get this urge and it's like nothing I've felt before, it's like a craving only more intense. I feel sick, and my whole body just sweats.

198,"A doctor I have talked to told me I should get tested for ASD but I don’t know if I should. I am going to tell you a little about myself to see if that helps. 

It’s hard to explain which is a thing I struggle with I can’t communicate that well. I will actually get irritated and angry when I try to talk about anything personal 

I’m terrible at small talk both in person and online. My text messages are usually one word responses it doesn’t matter if I texted you yesterday or months ago.

I can’t comfort people at all and I don’t understand others emotions like I was at a friend of the family’s daughter’s funeral she died at age 19 of lupus, the whole time I was there I kept thinking why is her mom crying she’s already dead crying won’t change anything. I don’t mean to be rude but I’m not good in sensitive social situations. 

I have certain routines I have to do like before I eat and if I can’t do them I get angry. I also go to bed a certain way with a routine I do every night and go to the bathroom with the same routine everyday. I plan a lot of things down to the smallest detail and in what order I am going to do them in and I really don’t like it when my routine changes. 

I have no friends, I can be friendly with people but I am not able to form any type of relationship. 

I can’t really tell how a person is feeling or thinking.

Plus I am not the greatest at social cues a teacher even called me a borderline bully because I guess when I was talking with a girl in my group I was being mean and rude but I wasn’t trying to be I was just talking I don’t understand people’s emotions. I know they have them but I don’t understand it. I just tell them the truth or first thing that comes to my mind

I HATE being touched it doesn’t matter who it is if I didn’t initiate it The DONT touch me. 

I observe a lot like if you got a haircut, seat in a different seat than normal, I can see patterns in almost everything. I will sometimes get so obsessed with small things like someone’s license plate number I will spend hours memorizing different plates or the model of the car and how many times I have seen that same model that day. 

It’s hard for me to deal with my emotions like if I get angry I start hitting my hands and head against walls, windows or doors or punching myself on the head. Or if I’m said I can’t tell other people why I’m sad or talk about what made me sad. 

The only time I want to talk to people is when it’s about something I have become obsessed with like I have studied 99% of dog breeds in the world and can talk about that for hours but if the topic changes I don’t want to talk anymore.

When I talk to people I avoid eye contact I hate looking at people in the eyes

I have a great imagination I can escape to a whole different world and pretend to be one of my favorite characters in a show or in a book. I can do this for hours and spent 90% of my childhood in a different world. I don’t mean like with dolls or toys but by acting out everything and talking for all the characters. I get a strong urge to do this a lot of the time and I even do it in public without noticing. 

The way I talk to one person is the same way I talk to everybody doesn’t matter who you are or how long I have known you

I’m great at math and learn quickly but I’m horrible at English. I don’t understand why I can’t just write the facts why do I have to word them a certain way. 

I hate noises even the smallest sound like if something falls down and makes a noise I get angry or if someone is taping a pen or a bag crinkling. Even when I listen to certain songs I get annoyed by the background noises 

I am pretty sure I am missing somethings but here is what I can think of right now. With everything I have listed do you think it is worth getting Autism spectrum testing. I am a 18 year old female which sucks because a lot of females get overlooked or misdiagnosed because ASD tends to effect males and females different.",08May2020,1

Long story short, my parents are separating because my grandmother, Mom’s IN-LAW, has ruined their relationship and got in between them. My dad continues to say that it is my mother who keeps stirring the pot, when REALLY it is my grandmother who has ruined everything. I see it with my own eyes. Why doesn’t he acknowledge what we say? I have no fucking clue. The way how I can explain is that my dad is the type of person that will see my grandmother SPIT in someone’s face but STILL tell you that she never spit in that person’s face. There’s always some reasoning or excuse. He always acts as if his mother can do wrong because she’s “old and ignorant”. I have no relationship with my grandmother even though we live in the house. She will only say one word to me which is “hello” or “good morning” all day. That’s how she treats me. She does not treat me like a real granddaughter. 

So even though I express these concerns to him. He doesn’t believe that it’s MY own opinion, he thinks it is 100% influenced by my mom because of her dislike for my grandma and with that he doesn’t truly believe that I have these feelings. He makes me feel like I can’t think for myself. Even though I am 19. To put it simply, my dad has a narrow minded view of life. He thinks “black and white”. No grey areas. Whenever something or someone disagrees with him, he tries to convince you of his own opinion, some sort of manipulation in a way. He can only see his perspective. So especially when I disagree, he always thinks it’s influenced by someone else.

My mother on the other hand thinks that I’ll be heard if I yell over them, if I “yell harder”, when they scream at each other. She says the reason why I’m not heard by him is because “I’m not angry enough”. I need to get more angry apparently. “You need to go ballistic and lose your shit.” It’s apparently my fault that I’m not being heard by my dad. “I’m too nice” when speaking to him. She actually said that I’m too submissive. You know that’s some BULLshit. I need to curse at my father and “lose my mind” even just to show him a “different side of me” and “maybe he’ll finally get it” she says. THATS NOT HOW IT WORKS LADY. 

She’s forcing me to get to that point because she thinks I might be “heard”. Too submissive? Are you kidding me? Have you forgotten what you AND my dad have pounded in my head for years? I don’t think she understands that for years that’s what I’m taught to do by them. Not to step out of my line and “know my place”. Any serious conversation I have that involves my issues, it would be more than just “disrespectful” if I do the things she’s trying to force me to do right now. Of course, I’m uncomfortable with cursing and going super insane at either of them because I feel like my mom is just saying this shit only because it’s THIS type of situation. Any other situation, it’s always another conversation about respect and what not. And what am I told? Not to be disrespectful and the obvious things u probably wouldn’t be doing to a parent. I remember when having conversations about the sex stuff, me trying to tell them about things that I don’t like that they do, them not giving me privacy, etc. She would always emphasize how disrespectful I sound and I DIDN’T EVEN CURSE but I’m still out of line because of how I react when they get me worked up. How come I couldn’t do what she’s telling me to do now in those other situations? Now it’s different because it’s this mother-in-law situation where NOW she’s like “go ahead, CURSE, do whatever you want because it’s THIS situation and your father needs to fucking understand!” I never got the opportunity to do that when I wanted to discuss my privacy. Hm. Why is it only when it’s a situation that directly affects her?

He’s not gonna hear a damn thing I said. He sure as hell won’t. If anything, I’ll be even MORE unheard. He’s going to say the same shit my mom would say in the past for those other situations. Why? Because that’s the type of person they’ve been teaching me to be since day one. So why would I feel any different in this situation? I’ve been told the same fucking thing in any other situation, so why would I think any different in this situation???

There’s not one way to describe it. There’s so many different types of thought within this one way of thinking that brings me so much distress. The examples are impossible to explain but still plentiful. What brings me the most anxiety is the cold, obscure abstractness of where my mind is capable of going. How their content encompasses things like trying to overcome them and bleeds into and feeds off of everything and anything in whatever way it needs to. What also brings me anxiety is the idea that they are hindering or obscuring my chances of religious progression which is most important to me in my life. I used to dwell on the content of these thoughts in a state of abject fear and disgust, or on how complex, subtle and impossible to get off my chest they are. And I still do, don’t get me wrong. But now I also dwell on and obsess over how I dwell on it. And that’s brought me to a point where it feels as though it’s seriously ruining my enjoyment of life because the layers have stacked and sorting it out feels impossible. Everything is scary to me now. Everything is a trigger. And each time it’s triggered (which is extremely frequent. Sometimes several times a minute) it’s like it evolves and mutates until its unrecognisable despite being incomprehensible enough at its starting point. With every passing day I fall deeper into my mind’s rabbit hole but my speed of falling grows exponentially. It always picks up from the horrifying place it has left off, feeding itself the ever-spawning fuel to keep spiralling further and further. I feel so far gone. A part of me believes I can make it back. I want to try but I don’t know where to start because I don’t even know if a single other person has even experienced or gone through anything remotely similar. This probably all sounds vague, but as soon as I try and go into detail, the scope and accuracy of the description is lost. And what matters most to me is that someone can UNDERSTAND so the loneliness and disturbing alienated feeling I get from it can subside. I’m always thinking ‘of all the billions of people, how typical is it that it had to be me to go through something this different and removed from what everyone else goes through.’ I don’t want to imply that other mental illness sufferers have it better than me. That would be nonsense. But sometimes it’s like I’m wishing I could have the ‘regular old depression’ where symptoms are more or less consistent from person to person and I can look to many existing sources for help. I thought writing it out would verify it and make it too real in an unpleasant way. But in a way, writing it out feels better. So that’s good I guess?",08May2020,1
206,"Something I’ve been battling with a lot in life is the intense feeling of not wanting to wake up. I’m just so exhausted, even though I’m not doing anything particularly difficult, but I find myself increasingly disappointed every time I wake up from sleep. Even today, I’m so disappointed after waking up from a short nap and realizing I still exist. It’s really dragging me down and I’m finding it harder and harder just enjoy living.

I’ve titled this post the way it is because I find this feeling coming and going. The worst it’s been was last month from April 13th all the way to the 20th (a full week), but since then I’ve been doing alright. Nothing really bad has happened. My family is healthy, we have the money needed to keep the bills paid, my friend and I are keeping in contact... But then this feeling started coming back a few days ago and I just don’t know what’s wrong. My online classes are almost over (I only have two tests left) and my job is secure, so there shouldn’t be much stress on my shoulders. Even so, I find myself wanting to stop existing altogether. To go to sleep and not wake up again. To not even know that I exist at all. 

I’ve been told by friends to reach out for help whenever I feel this way, but it’s just hard to talk to people I personally know, so I guess I’m just putting it out here in hopes that I’ll muster up the courage to actually talk to my loved ones. Hopefully I can. Thanks for reading.",08May2020,1

Why did it have to be all about me and my troubles? Why do I feel like a failure? 

Today I walked in the park for some green therapy, I was hoping I could be treated. Instead, I got images of me drowning in the lake - so morbid, I know- and I was trying to figure out how deep the water was.

209,"I’ve been a year clean last month, and I’ve had my fair share of panic attacks since, but this one hit hard. It was just a build up of stuff, but my stepmom triggered it by letting loose on me for being “lazy, undeserving of living in the house, useless, and how I can’t do anything right.” She made up a bunch of chores I was supposed to do (which she didn’t tell me about) to get my dad pissed at me and when I called her out she just said “you don’t remember like you never remember anything I tell you” and I honestly just started honestly freaking the fuck out. I got really mad and upset about it and started punching and bruising myself and then just instantly went for a pair of scissors. I sat down at my pc and was like “yo wtf am I doing?” and then went on discord and expressed how I was feeling. Someone was there for me and made me feel a bit better.

210,"I'm reposting from r/OCD because this was removed

It started as HOCD back in august, went away but it came back and now I have HOCD, TOCD and POCD. If you don't understand those terms, its just sexual OCD, and I can feel it coarsing through everything I can think of. It's all i ever think about now, from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep. I feel like my identity has been permanantly shattered. I don't see men and women the same way anymore, in public or online. I now hyperfixate over things relating to TOCD, HOCD and things I used to not bat an eye to  like gender politics, pronouns like 'he and her' and shit. When I try to tell myself ""I'm a man"" I feel like I'm lying to myself somehow or if that's not even right anymore. I feel like I'm piloting a body and I feel weird looking at myself in the mirror. I used to be very attentive with my masculine looks and would dabble in the mirror constantly; but now I can't. I have false attraction to disturbing ideas and images I used to joke about like messed up fetishes, because they're mutual to the initial thoughts somehow? I don't know anymore. (Just by typing that out I feel like I'm lying to myself again) The anxiety over the inital thoughts are gone, but the thoughts and fake internal dialogue arn't going away and that's whats bringing me back to square one. every. single. time. I'm aware of the options for medications like SSRI's but I'm deathly afraid of screwing with my brain and developing PSSD. 

I went from being a shy, but deep-thinker to an anxiety-riddled mess and I can't put the brakes on to a threat that may or may not exist. This is a nightmare and I would give anything for a 'reset button' to start over again. I want to uncorrupt my mind and forget this ever happened, is that even possible? **Everything** **I enjoy in my life has been tainted. I can no longer think clearly and my brain is imploding on itself.**

This combination of recovering from porn-addiction and sexual OCD is what's going to make my head short-circuit and stop-working, If it hasn't already.",08May2020,1
211,"Coronavirus is seriously killing me. Not the actual infection, but the mental health effects that come with isolation. 

At first isolation was easy. But a few weeks ago, it felt like I was starting to have a depression of some sort. Absolutely no energy or motivation for even the slightest things, and I felt like crap for weeks. But then school started, and it got a little better. We were pretty good at social distancing.  

But now it’s really starting to slip. My problem is, I can’t keep doing this. It feels like I’m slowly breaking down overtime, because I can’t have physical contact and I have to think about this goddamn virus every moment when I’m around anyone at all. Being constantly bombarded with news about the virus doesn’t help at all either.

I just can’t do that any longer, and I don’t even know when this will stop. I’m getting more and more negative about the situation every day, and life just sucks, and I have no idea when it will stop. Will it take 30 years? 5? Oh yeah, and there’s a huge economic crisis like never before that I will be part of solving, which maybe will take 10 terrible years of my life and everyone else’s. 

Fuck this whole situation. I really wish I could just vanish. I’m losing every bit of motivation I have. What are you guys doing to not lose your sanity in these times? I know my state isn’t nearly as bad as any of the others here, but I guess it’s okay to ask here.",08May2020,1

214,"When I was 10 my mother lost her battle to cancer. Not even a year later my dad remarried. His new wife was hell to live with. From 11-17 (I’m 20 now), she caused me a great deal of pain. She would say, “your ugly, you need to wear make up because your ugly (so I bought make up and she got mad at me for getting makeup.), your a disgrace, your worthless, there’s nothing positive about you, your fat, your a horrible Christian, nobody likes you, but the worst thing she ever said was, “I’m so happy your mothers dead so, she doesn’t have to see the person you became!) she ripped up my mothers notes, she threw away everything of my mothers. She would throw away my clothes, my pillow, made me sleep on the floor for a year, I wasn’t allowed to go near her dog, I wasn’t allowed to drink the root beer, and I wasn’t allowed to sit in the lazy boy. She would humiliate me anywhere, anytime, it’ll be in front of friends, family, and in public. This was an everyday thing for 6 years. Finally my dad kicked her out, but when she moved out I would have nightmares every night, most of the time I would wake up in the middle of the night and scream, “shut the **** up, just shut up!!!” I still have flashbacks, but not as severe as It used to be. The nightmares are subsiding as well. I do have severe anxiety, sometimes it gets so bad that it leads to suicidal thoughts. I was just wondering, what kind of abuse is this? And did I show signs of PTSD or am I just overreacting?

I don't feel like I have depression or any of the big names you hear about, I do have body dismorphia which I am trying to battle with by exercising and just positive thoughts, I learned that as a kid when I looked in the mirror and I wasn't fat but I wasn't skinny and it's a lil bit of a pussy way to think but in my mind I though I had the perfectly wrong body, never really socialized or fit in I was the annoying tag along nobody liked and that continued until freshman year where I was a tag along for a group of dumbass kids who bullied me and I didn't take the hint but they were all I knew and I feel like the mild acceptance i got there was the most I would get.  Changed schools afternoon sophomore year. Felt like a new start new school and new people. Still failed to fit in I was a loner and I still am to this day not the emo or school shooter kind i just don't talk much, this is where I started to experiment with pills painkillers made me doze off in class and I would get in trouble but stimulants on the other hand made me feel good, I was able to talk easier I didn't really fit in more but I became more known and was slightly more accepted in the school more confidence more positive that stuff worked wonders. I was then labeled as a tweaker but I didn't really care at that point up to this day I don't give a fuck what people think of me(I do but it's kind of pick and choose call me a asshole IDC but I don't want to be the weird kid). All that anxiety and feeling of something about me is wrong I have a tear in my jeans I didn't know about my t-shirt makes me look fat, people are laughing behind my back, just poof. Problem is that I understood I couldn't just keep buying it to feel normal so I stopped but acted the same and it was a fake it until you make it kinda thing I still abuse them but I did alot of drugs and have been clean from most everything but one stimulant. And that brings me to now me being the nonsocial person I am and this quarantine I don't know what to do I have this empty feeling and a tension in my shoulders and I feel like I want to let out energy but also roll into a ball and hide because of the feeling of impending doom. I don't know how to converse with people very well in a interesting manner so I can't text without weirding people out(put me in front of an interviewer and I got it) I know how to talk formally with people of authority. That's aside the point I don't know what the hell I'm feeling this isn't drug related I know what that feels like and I don't know what to do with all this information but it's been in my head forever and a diary always seemed kind of gay (no offense to peoples choices of sexuality) so this is where I'm putting it.

223,"So... A think i learned myself in quarantine. I'm originally from Croatia but i work in Austria for almost a year now. I couldn't get back to Croatia because i don't have a car and i couldn't go back with a train or bus because soon they closed the borders. I've been living with a roommate. I was always saying for myself that i'm introverted, passive and such. I need my personal space blah blah. 

So the thing i taught myself is this. Everything that bothers you, you can change that it doesn't bother you. I do it like this. I usually observe everything around me, living, dead, details, big picture all of it. I observe my feelings too, so if a certain trigger, lets say my roommate eats loud in our room (he does). Originally i thought to myself, wtf, this idiot is like an animal. Doesn't he know he can sit at a chair and eat at a table like a normal person. I was cooking in myself so much thoughts. But that's a spiral i can't go out of. What i'm doing is, noticing the triggers and changing my feelings, acting on the triggers. So when i see a trigger i know i'm gonna get mad or frustrated. So i start to think of a perspective that could make me feel less bad about the situation or a solution if nothing helps. Like, ok, i can talk to him about this (solution) or maybe he likes eating here because he's scared of the world too (perspective), he doesn't want to go out. He's alright here in this room. 

This is a mechanism i built on my own. It needs time for it to become strong and efficient but start slowly and build on it. 

So as you build in your head this kind of stuff, you should build physical stuff too. Like finding a hobby, just go for it. You have an idea? Do it, if you don't stick to it, it means you aren't interested. Move on to another hobby. You can do lots of stuff and it doesn't have to cost you a lot of money. Don't belittle yourself, you can do a lot. Talent means nothing, you have to keep going at it. Pick one thing and do it as much as you can. Set a goal. It can be something minor too, doesn't have to be a hobby. Like I'll brush my teeth twice a day for a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

Cheers people! Self compassion and self love! Nurture that, you are worth living!!!! Don't go by your own hand (mind), it's not meant to be like that. Let the world take you, not you yourself.

227,"Hey everyone. 
I’m a 22 year old woman and have been suffering from mental health issues since early childhood that have just gotten worse and worse with time. My childhood was okay, it was pretty good, I was always unhappy and lashed out at my parents for no good reason. They tried their best and we’re loving but I for some reason always resented them. I grew up with a twin who was very popular, happy and loved. I was often bullied for my looks and just that I was weird but honestly don’t think it affected me so much. My biggest issue was that I never had any friends. My last friend I had was when I was around 7. I had some sexual trauma a couple years ago and things got worse then, but before that I was still bad this just accelerated things so it’s not fair to blame anything on that. 

I’ve been impatient 5 or 6 times (3 for eating disorders) and 4-5 of them were between 2017-2019. It makes me feel so crazy and like I can never get better. This hopelessness makes me have this impulse to just kill myself amongst other triggers. Even though I feel depressed/anxious a lot of the time and then have periods of elation, I keep getting so many different diagnoses and I don’t think bipolar applies to me. 

My main issue is with my obsessive behaviour especially in relationships. It’s ruining my life. I am in a constant state between addiction and disinterest. I don’t know where to draw a line between love/hate, obsession/disinterest, elation/depression, feeling overwhelmed/boredom. Everything is always in extremes and keeps getting worse. For example, this morning I was feeling so in love with my boyfriend. Haven’t seen him in two months bc were separated in different countries due to quarantine but he was texting me and I could feel my chest filling up with love and I couldn’t stop smiling. Later this afternoon, we got in a tiny argument that lasted for about four minutes. I left him around three missed calls before he texted me that he was with friends and we would talk later. I got so annoyed and started spiralling into this depression , feelings of worthlessness and hatred, wanting to break up with him, etc, after having a pretty nice day. 

Obviously, I try to keep this inside as best as possible bc I’m aware that it’s toxic and irrational but he’s really smart and perceptive and he sees it in me. I’m like this with my family and friends. My mother has cut me off now even though we used to be best friends - I was just too toxic for her. 

I literally have no clue what’s wrong with me. And I am starting to have no hope of getting better. I just want to feel okay and loved. I really just mostly needed to rant but also could use some advice. I think maybe I’m some sort of narcissist :( 

Thank you everyone",08May2020,1
228,"(Warning: a long story)

THE BACKSTORY:

Adam (35M) and I (30F) have been together for two years. The break-up, which occurred just before Easter, was difficult. I loved him but had to admit to myself we were not compatible. He moved back to his place the night of the break-up. I had not noticed anything 'unusual' about his behaviour in the two years we had been together, except for the fact he was deeply religious (I am an atheist), and he had a very complicated, dysfunctional relationship with his father, which sometimes threw him off balance. I had never met his parents due to it.

THE FIRST INCIDENT:

I received a message from Adam a few days after the break-up. He asked if I were at home and if he could stop by. On the day of the break-up, we agreed we would meet up and discuss the situation once the emotions didn't run high, so while the message came out of nowhere, it did not catch me completely by surprise. I replied I was, and he could.

Thirty minutes later, he texted me he was waiting outside. The buzzer in my building complex does not work, so I always have to go down and open the front door myself. Adam wasn't there. I waited, looked around, called out his name. Nothing. I called his phone. Finally, I noticed he was hiding across the street between two cars. He later admitted he had been hidden there for two hours, long before he even texted me.

He spoke for an hour with no pause. His speech was incoherent; I had trouble understanding what his point was. He was clearly distressed. He seemed to have been scared by someone. He told me he needed to hide something outside his place, where the person could not find it. It sounded strange, but I presumed he had a larger sum of money at home, which someone knew about and could steal from him. That being said, I never found out what the thing, which he needed to conceal, was. He told me he had hidden it elsewhere while waiting for my reply to his text message. He then returned home.

INTERMEZZO:

We met up in a park to speak shortly after the incident. I told him he had sounded insane that night, and I had been scared of him. Adam admitted his actions had been weird. However, he wrote it off as a one-night incident. 

We started meeting up regularly afterwards, hoping we could fix what we had. We almost started dating again. Then we reached another major obstacle and once again decided to part ways.

THE SECOND INCIDENT:

I hadn't spoken to Adam in a week. I was returning home from work when I found Adam outside my apartment door with two large duffle bags. He asked if he could spend the night at my place. I agreed to let him in. It turned out to be the longest night of my life.

He told me he had to run off. Go abroad. Change his identity. They were after him and ready to kill him. He completed his work and stroke the fatal blow, but they didn't know and were out to get him. He had erased his hard drive and destroyed his phone so they couldn't track him. He had made sure to get off the bus on a street far from mine, changed his clothes and only walked the streets with little/no CCTV. They knew we had broken up, so they would not look for him here. 

He spoke about how he was the prophet. He said that if he were to die in the night by natural causes, I was to leave him there because he would rise from the dead. He spoke of angels and voices, which gave him guidance. He stayed awake the entire night, and I with him. I was scared he would commit suicide, and I was scared he could hurt me if he mistook me for someone else.

He was breathing fast the entire night. He observed the street below my apartment from behind the curtain and called me to keep an eye on a suspicious car. He opened the front door to my apartment at 3 am because he was convinced someone was hiding behind them. He asked me not to wear my jumper because it was boyish, and the assassins could mistake me for him. He told me to call him another name and made up an entire story for why he was in my flat. 

The morning eased his worries, and he finally fell asleep while I worked from home. When he woke up hours later, he admitted he went over the top and changing his identity/leaving the country was not necessary. Nonetheless, he still asserted wiping off his computer and getting a new phone was paramount to his safety. He still believed in the existence of the voices. He also asked me to go out to a local supermarket and buy him new clothes. We parted out ways in the evening. He said he would visit his family the following day, today, to let them know he was fine. He asked me not to tell anyone about the fact he had spent the night at my place. 

Adam's mum messaged me out of nowhere last night. We have never met nor spoken before, but she couldn't get in touch with Adam, and she was scared. I replied he wasn't with me at the moment, but he told me he would visit them. She texted me today he had called them.

I don't know where to go from here. Adam is obviously not aware of the extent of his delusions. He promised me yesterday it would not happen again; he said he had had a bad night. Do I tell his family? Do I tell anyone? What do I do? I care about him. 

**TL;DR** My ex-boyfriend, with whom I am still in contact, has developed a paranoid delusion that he is a mesaiah and powerful people want to kill him. He trusts me and seeks my help when he feels in danger.",08May2020,1
229,"So I think I have a problem about love, because I can't really show my family that I love them. Deep inside I care for them (at least most) but showing it (hugs, convo,...) doesn't really work for me.

When it comes to romantic life...
I want to have someone that will love me and the same way back, but every time something happens in that kind of way (I notice she wants to kiss or it would be great opurtunity to hold hands, make a move,...) I feel like it's cheezy/dumb-funny. 
It's frustrating as I feel that primal side - reproduce and all of that, I feel the need. But the human part of it (mind) doesn't agree - somewhere there is a blocade that keeps the feelings in.

Others feelings I find no problem (happines/joy is great, anger, fear, sadnes - but I avoid it).
I like being in company/social settings, but if I don't connect strong it can make me feel like Im not welcomed in it.

Anybody of you guys/girls have a clue whats wrong with me? And how to fix it.",08May2020,1
230,"I am frustrated with myself for being so low the last few months. I don't work (I'm a stay at home mom to 3 kids), my husband kept his job, and our salary hasn't changed. My oldest is in a residential facility for depression and suicidal thoughts, so I'm actually only taking care of 2 of them. The hospital bill will suck but we're on a payment plan and we won't go bankrupt. So why am I so depressed? Why do I sleep so much? I'm trying to pass my days as quickly as possible. I live for the evening/weekend when my husband is home to help with the kids, then they go to bed and I can play on my phone and stay up too late. I'm eating like shit and have zero energy or motivation. I hate myself for being so weak. Plenty of people have worse situations. How do I snap out of this? I feel so worthless.",08May2020,1
231,"Hey. So ive been feeling bad lately, I dont have friends, no one to talk to, and Im starting to feel hopeless. Is there anyone there who wants to be friends? Its stupid to not have any friends. I think that anyone has but me. I feel that I'm the only one who doesnt have one.",08May2020,1
232,"Title says it all. I know people normally have infrequent episodes of sadness as a way of venting, so i want to know what exactly do i have.

So for most of the week, i consider myself happy and normal, but for a day or two (sometimes 3) of the week, i get severly depressed, and thinking my friends are my friends because they pity me, and that i'm actually worthless to them, and i do consider suicide during these episodes, and i did try to attempt it once or twice but always backed off before it got actually risky.

So TL;DR, my depressive symptoms get severe, but i only struggle with them for 2 or 3 days of the week, and not everyday.",08May2020,1
233,"Is anyone mental health spiraling out of control during quarantine? Mine has, my depression is getting a bit out of control and getting those thoughts again. All I want to do is lay and bed and cry for no reason or just give up on trying anything. I am still working but the things that I did to keep myself busy are not able to happen during this quarantine. Does anyone have cooping method they would like to share? It can be anything, as long I can try something new.",08May2020,1
234,"Hi I’m a 20 year old female, welp I’ve been very abused by men my whole life. I suffer from depression, anxiety and very bad paranoia because of this I and engaged to a man who is amazing to me the first male to ever be by my side threw a lot but because of the abuse I think he is constantly going to leave me or cheat or just leave I know that’s horrible to think but like it’s just instilled in me I’m just dealing with my mental health and need friends and just to know I’m not alone",08May2020,1
235,"TW: Suicide, self harm

&amp;#x200B;

I've been kind of fucked up for a few years now, just getting progressively worse. I've just been hanging on as best as I can. Coping where possible, mostly using escapism and self-harming when things get real shit. I feel like I have no voice most of the time. I don't think people understand that I'm not okay and I haven't been for a while.  My parents just tell me I have nothing to worry about. They know I have problems with going outside and leaving the house, and mom has even acknowledged that there are disorders for that but she never thought to get me checked for it. She knows I have panic attacks, but just tells me to drink tea and calm down as if I haven't tried that before.

I'm just lonely. But I want to be alone. All the fucking time, too. I don't want to talk to anyone and I wish my parents would understand that. I just don't want to be near anyone. I don't feel the need to anymore and my parents get pissed because they feel I'm being an asshole for avoiding them and my siblings and I just don't care. I don't fucking care and I haven't for a while. I just wish they'd stop acting as if I'm an asshole because I'm ""hurting them"" when no one stops to think what's wrong with me. It's just that I'm an asshole and there's no other explanation. But I'm just tired, tired, tired of people and being near them, and having to put up with them. Most days it feels like the only way I can get out of this hole is my killing myself. I won't do it. Don't worry, but the thoughts are constantly there. Always an out for when things turn to shit.

I can't get therapy until I can get a job (which I was planning on doing this summer). Now that will have to wait. I was hoping that maybe I could save up to get assessed for ASD since that's something I suspect I have. But there goes that idea as well. I just want help for once. I just want someone to listen to me and tell me that I'm not an asshole and that I just need help. Or someone to at least tell that to my parents since they don't seem to listen. It's always about what they want, how they feel, never about me. I'm sorry, I don't know where this is going I just want someone to see this. I just want to put this somewhere other than my fucking journal for once. I'm just tired of being invalidated and I'm tired of being invalidated all the time and I'm tired of not having a single person listen to me when I say that I need help. I'm tired of being made out to be the bad guy when I just want to hide away from the world.",08May2020,1
236,i have struggled with my image my entire life. i have never liked a single thing about myself. my boyfriend and i recently broke up to fix ourselves but i cant even get into therapy because i lost my insurance. i’m depressed anxious and now heartbroken and it feels like it will never be okay again. He was unfaithful a few times and it shattered my trust and i was never able to fully trust him again. i started getting jealous over small things after this. my self esteem was more fucked then it was before. i don’t know what to do or how to feel okay again,08May2020,1
