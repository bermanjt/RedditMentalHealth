2,"Let's say you have a very consistent nagging feeling that something is missing, wrong, or not good enough. You turn to yourself and ask what it is you want to do to live with happiness but you can never decide on an answer. You really can't understand who you are or who you want to be.

How did you answer that question? What guided you to that answer? Therapy? Medication? Finding that change you need to make to finally improve your happiness?",29Sep2020,1
3,"If it’s not one thing it’s another and I can’t take it anymore. I have no support system and I know if I dropped off the face of the planet the only people that would notice would be my kids and my husband (him noticing only because I wouldn’t be there to take care of the kids). I’m invisible and have been my whole life. I try to reach out and connect with people but always end up forgotten and left out regardless. Apparently I have weak personal boundaries? I mean, I don’t like being treated like shit but it’s either that or have zero interaction with anyone pretty much ever again. Which, I guess is kind of already happening thanks to covid. I should be grateful things didn’t stay as bad as they were earlier in the year but damn, it’s by a fine margin. Maybe I’m just a bitch and I am the problem, I’m the common denominator anyway. Lack of sleep and lack of time for myself for self-care (or to even pee alone) probably is making it harder to pull myself out of this. The abyss is calling, it’s hard to resist.",29Sep2020,1
4,"I dont have any auditory hallucinations, Its like 2 people are living inside my brain.

I used to feel like a lone person, like just one ego/conscioussness, making my own descisions, with my own inner voice.

Now theres Me, which I think is the main inhabitant, to be honest, now that Im typing this, I dont know anymore.

Then theres lower Me, who has a voice like mine bur with a More raspy evil voice, like a less intense versio n of Gumball's voice when he gets possessed.

Then theres higher me, who has calm voice that tries to be all spiritual and shit.

My mind gets really messed up and shit from these 2 voices but they only reallly flare out when in social interaction. When im alone, i feel like half of myself but theres no sign of them at all.

8,"This past March I was convinced that my phone was hacked and someone was spying on me through the camera lens. Possible...but unlikely. I also believed that I had some kind of rare disease that I absolutely don’t have. For instance, Ehlers Danlos, Marfan Syndrome, and Parry Romberg Syndrome to name a few. My freshman year of highschool during my first bout of severe depression, I suddenly became super religious and had delusional thoughts such as worrying that if I ate an apple, it would cause the world to end. I was always being watched and judged. Even going to a sporting event was a sin because we were “praising” something other than God. I would break out into sobbing fits because everyone I knew was going to hell. It was all I could think about.

I have talked to others that have also experienced either hallucinations or delusional thinking with anxiety and depression and I think it’s quite common. For myself, I wasn’t able to recognize this until recently, and I always looked back and feared I was “losing my mind”. It helps me to know that others experience it and it just meant my depression was really bad. Let’s end the stigma! Let me know what your experiences have been.",29Sep2020,1
9,"For the past month or so I had finally found something in life I enjoyed and looked forward to every day, it was a specific individual. Now I'm certain I have abandonment issues and that's why I had subconsciously 'competed' with everyone else to be their #1 person, I gave them everything I had because I didn't want them to leave me. I always felt happy when I was with them, but then one weekend they became really distant (and before you say that they were probably just really busy with stuff, they weren't). I decided to just leave the group of individuals that we shared because I felt like if they're already becoming distant even though we talked every day, I might as well save myself the trouble and emotional pain of having to separate from them later if we have a closer bond and leave now so I don't have to go through as much. I had posted a 19 tweet twitter thread as my goodbye letter to that community and they mistook it as me going to harm myself, and they tried to contact me. I obviously didn't want to talk to them anymore to just run away from my problems and so I ignored their messages and calls, they called the cops on me but that's not really a relevant sentence. Why did I do this, I genuinely have no clue why I decided to do what I did, why did I post a 19 tweet thread talking about my feelings, why did I ignore them when they tried to reach out. But then why did they spread lies about me saying that I was joking about self-harm and how I'm a bad person because I intentionally avoided people who cared about me. Why did I decide to leave, why do I compete to be the 'best' friend someone has, seriously, why can't I figure out what's wrong with me. I can't put my feelings into words that well but I'm living miserably being constantly sad and depressed, and that's only part of my issues, I have no clue what else I'm suffering from but it always feels like the whole entire world is coming against me, the way I look, the way I speak, the way I do certain things, the things I eat, the friends I have, my personality, it's almost like I was meant to be alone. All I wanted was to be loved, I'm tired of being alone but I'm starting to think that I'm the one making myself be like this.",29Sep2020,1

11,"My dad was harassing my mom all day because she owed him 14 dollars (texted her all day and showed up at her door about an hour ago.)

She texted me about four hours ago asking me to tell him to stop texting her constantly, so I called him (he was out) and told him to stop. He scoffed and hung up on me.

She called me not long ago crying (after he already went to her DOOR) because she said he was stressing her out. She only gave him 10 because that's all she had, since she had to pay something today.

So I told him to fucking stop it for the SECOND TIME today. More forcefully this time because he took it way too fucking far.

He insulted her, so I called him an asshole. He then proceeded to call me a bitch and a stupid fuck, and threatened to slap me (but didn't because he doesn't have the fucking balls to do it.)

I went back to my room eventually. Three minutes later, I'm just sitting on my bed, and he CONTINUES the argument by saying ""go stay with your mom"" (a line that he says to me EVERY SINGLE TIME WE ARGUE) and ""get out of my house.""

(I'd just like to say that the reason I don't actually go stay with my mom is because she's an alcoholic, and tends to be very clingy and sensitive/angry when she's drunk. Lived with her AND my dad for 5-6 months in 2017 and it was absolute hell. She's also a constant smoker, and I have sensitive lungs. She refuses to step outside.)

All I fucking did was tell him to stop harassing his ex-wife over 14 fucking dollars that she DIDN'T HAVE.

It's like I don't even have parents. My mom is only good in the daytime. My dad is good sometimes but is suddenly an asshole an hour later and he gets angry at the smallest things. And since he's good SOMETIMES I can never STAY mad at him. It pisses me off.",29Sep2020,1
12,"So I'm 20F and I was dating this guy (who was a friend for two years) for a year and he became a completely different person in the relationship in a bad way. He became manipulative, dismissive, angered at my emotions, and narcisstic above all else. He truly wrecked my already declining mental health, but I am starting to recover now.

What has gotten worse is the feelings of being undesirable now that it has been long enough that I feel ready to meet someone new. I don't feel ready to necessarily seek OUT anyone yet, but if someone came into my life, I wouldn't be opposed. However, I have seemingly struggled more now with being single, feeling like although I WANT to be single because I'm forwarding my life and need focus, I simultaneously feel like I need a partner to survive, especially in my lowest moments. This is completely false - what I need is a friend - but the feeling is there nonetheless regardless of logic.

Now where this leads me to currently is that I've had an eating disorder (binge eating disorder) for nine years and it has gone and come back over the years, along with yoyo-ing from being a healthy weight for a few years, to overweight for a year, to obese. Things had gotten bad this past year with too many details to list now, and so binging got worse and I've gone from slightly overweight to now obese. I'm trying to seek eating disorder treatment and I eat healthily outside of my binges, but it's just the compulsions to just drown my feelings with food that I can't seem to fight. It's very similar if not identical to how an alcoholic wants to drown out sorrows with a bottle. My drug of choice is sugar. It directly affects the brain with dopamine centres and now I am fully addicted. 

Anyway, this weight gain has of course affected my self esteem massively. I don't fit into most of my clothes now and my style has completely changed to wear the most covering clothes I can find. I have very recently moved to uni and everyone is smaller than me and in their ""prime"" whilst I'm ALMOST at my worst of my life. It's depressing. There's one guy in my flat who I get on with really well and we have the same sense of humour and everything. I realised that I was attracted to him (I mean he is drop dead gorgeous and I'm just a hippo for crying out loud. He has abs and everything.) and just noticed it and moved on with the night with my flatmates. He mentioned he had a girlfriend to the group and my stomach just sank. It's such an overreaction but recently I pin ALL of my hopes on someone finding me attractive so I feel a sense of some self worth. We don't even have to DATE because I know I'm not freaking ready, it's just that ""ah, I am still loveable"". We even played never have I ever where it was like take as many sips as hot girls in the room and I made a joke about castration (let's just...not) to avoid the anxiety of realising, ah, they only drank twice and there's three girls. One the guys mentioned tonight that he would have drank twice and it's not rocket science to figure out who's the ugly one. 

I just don't feel good enough. I'm working towards trying to overcome my eating disorder and I will lose the weight naturally because of my main meals being healthy, so if you remove all the junk food binges, the weight will come off by itself. I feel ashamed. I feel like I'll be judged for this dark secret of mine like people will think I'm some fat pig with no self control, so I need to justify that I ran a half marathon in 2018 in one of my better years. This isn't me. I've spent more years past 11 years old thin than I have fat, and I've only been badly overweight for 2020, so this just doesn't feel like me. I don't recognise myself in the mirror. My style isn't a reflection of who I am, it's a reflection of my insecurity.

I just need some advice or understanding or supportive words to know I'm not some crazy person. Idk.

14,"I'm getting so stressed thinking about it.  I left my previous job after saving money to try and make it as a composer.  That failed since I'm not good at marketing myself or in general appearing happy for clients on Twitter.  

Every job I've ever had, in fact really any time I've been in a situation where I am forced to interact with the same people on a common basis I just end up hating people I'm around.  They may not even be that bad but I just end up hating them eventually.  There's something wrong with everyone and I'll find it or rather my mind will find it and fixate on it and make it a reason I shouldn't want to be around them.

I don't have friends any more because I pushed them away or knew I wasn't worth their time.  Luckily my dad has offered to help me look for a job.  But my birthday is in a week, I'll be 29.  And my 60 year old dad is still helping me with basic things.

I've never been diagnosed with anything but depression but I've never looked into it more really.  My parents have always sort of steered me away from getting a diagnosis but I know there's something up with my mind that's more than just depression.  Anxiety for sure, maybe ADD or autism idk.

17,"I committed to therapy in August after I found out that a therapist I've had my eye on for years had openings for virtual sessions. I've been to a few mental health professionals before but never done more than 2 sessions because they often just rubbed me the wrong way, I've done 4 virtual sessions with this woman but I've (we've?) accomplished nothing yet. 

I like this therapist, she isn't super knowledgeable but she seems to genuinely care and she doesn't treat me like a child, but I feel like the sessions aren't helping. The first session it seemed like we'd do a CBT approach, she gave me resources, homework, made a plan about what would happen at the next session, but then the next session came and she asked about work and that took up the entire session. At the time I was ok with it because it felt good to vent but then it happened again at the next session and since nothing changed at work it felt sort of pointless to be going over the same stuff again. I told myself this week I'd ask to talk about something else if we started talking about work because to spend an hour and $130 to just essentially repeat our little song and dance for a third time seemed like a waste. But yet again we spent pretty much the entire session talking about the same crap because I just kept answering her questions and didn't know what else we could discuss anyway. 

I don't know what to do. I don't have an unlimited amount of time and money to spend on therapy and while I knew this would be a process I was hoping to at least feel like I was making progress by the fourth session. Of the six professionals I have spoken to over the years she's definitely been my favourite so dropping her seems stupid but I am contemplating it. Part of me wonders if I'm just easy money, *log on for an hour a week and listen to this kid talk about work, say a few trite placating remarks and ask a few questions to keep her talking, a quick $130* because she doesn't take notes or seem to have a structure to the sessions or an overall plan. With the exception of the first session there's been no resources and no homework, it's like she doesn't even spend time between sessions preparing anything (I was always told therapy is so expensive because three hours go into every one hour session, the other two being for case noting and planning and resource gathering). 

If I drop her though it's unlikely I'll do therapy again for quite some time. I actually found this therapist years ago after months of research and I no longer have that sort of time to do that kind of research. My past research was also quite extensive and out of all the therapists in this region she was the one that stood out as being the best so either I'm not good at making these kinds of judgements or maybe therapy just isn't for me. I was really hoping that this would be it because I don't know what else to do, my doctors say they've done all they can for me right now and I just need to reduce my stress but my stress is from my physical health eating into so much of my life leaving me with no energy to do anything other than work and survive (and even that's a struggle most days) I was hoping therapy would somehow give me more energy or help me find a way to do more so that I could stop stressing about feeling like I'm wasting life away at work, or maybe so I could develop a support system or have more to my life so that when things hit the fan at work it doesn't feel like my entire life is crashing down.

22,"I would like to be brief, but my father who I love very much often seems very paranoid. When he goes out somewhere he comes back with a story of how someone was 'watching' him, how people have 'listening' devices on the house, and now he is asking me to physically write a note if I need him to pick something up at a store for me because he thinks people are watching his phone and will know he is at that place if I send it by text. If a car is driving the same direction behind him he says they're following him. If he passes a parked car on the street he says they're waiting to watch him. He even put up security cameras to watch outside. Whenever someone turns into our driveway he looks up in a suspicious way. For some background he worked for our local government but had an accident at work and as such is disabled, and as such he retired early and gets paid retirement from our city (I don't remember what the 'paid retirement' is called.) He told me tonight, after I asked, that he thinks 'they' were watching him since like 1998 if not earlier. I'm not sure if that means he's been paranoid since then or if it means that he now looks back and ""realizes"" (in quotes because no way it's true,) that it was happening back then. But no matter how much I debunk instances of people 'watching' him he still was paranoid. I don't know what to do. He has a less progressive view of mental illness so I'm not sure if he'd ever willingly go to a psychologist, but I can't have him forcibly admitted because I am 16. I'm not sure how that works either. And I don't want him to be sad or anything or think it's part of the 'conspiracy.' Does anyone have any advice on what I should do about this?

I'm feel constantly insecure, and I wish I had more positive affirmation, but I cannot accept a compliment without my brain twisting it. Someone said I'm doing a good job? Obviously, I'm failing but they are saying that to try to lift me up enough to finish whatever it is, or so I don't fail even worse. I look pretty today? Well, they probably think I'm looking a little fat/frumpy whatever it may be and I need the boost. 

In turn, I gave trouble complimenting others, because my brain turns that around too. You're going to tell them that? They are going to think you're an idiot. You can't say that, that's awkward... those types of things.

It doesn't matter of it's work, family or friends, I feel like an inconvenience and that I'm always doing the wrong thing. So I over think. Then I tend to make things worse due to my inactions. 

I can logically see what my brain is doing - but I can't move past it and I have not been successful changing the way I think.

32,"So I'm 22(m) and I'm pretty sure I've been hetero my whole life, but I've doubted constantly for the past 2-3 years.

I had the most wonderfull relationship with a girl for two years, and for all that time I never doubt it at all. But two years ago I took mushrooms with a male friend, and at the end of that trip he started playing some gay vibe music, making me feel different and also making me encounter my first conscious gay tought, nothing happened, but before that I actually kissed a boy once being hetero, wasn't a big deal really, I just saw it as a crazy stunt. I honestly was kind of heartbroken and wanted to know what did my ex-girlfriend felt when she kissed me. Kind of weird, but made sense to me back then.

For all that time I was certain about my sexuality, so fast forward to the complicated part. I smoked a joint with another male friend and once high, I started thinking to myself: Am I giving him a gay vibe? It felt wrong and very anxiety triggering. That was the head start to the heavy uncertainty about my sexuality, because that question I made to myself that day, started appearing every day since then, making my confidence dissapear, and causing some heavy anxiety, like never before, I hated having lunch with my family or having physical conversations at all, because the anxiety was overwhelming, words like ''hard'' or ''banana'' or simply grabing something phallic shaped triggered the big question, am I gay?, I don't want to be gay, I'm okay like this, but what do these messages mean then. So like a good gen z individual I google it, and found out I had HOCD (homosexual obsesive compulsive disorder), tried to learn how to handle it, I sort of handle it, but all of the messages and red flags kept showing up.

So, all this nonsense colapsed one day and I told my mom: I think I could really use some professional help. Couple of sessions passed by until one day my psychologist along with my psychiatrist diagnosed me with Cannabis induced psychosis. Started going to a day hospital, I got medication, stoped drinking and smoking. I felt good.

Time went on, still on medication, I had a party in my house, 6am, drunk and high, started to realize something really weird, I felt that all of the conversations had a second meaning, for example: if I told a girl, This has to be one of the most wonderfull days I've ever seen, the REAL meaning was me refering to her, that SHE is one of the persons most wonderfull I've ever seen, only by looking her expressions or looking at my feeling at the moment I said it.

So it's kind of exhausting and also weirdly magical but I've been giving this tought attention for the past months, and some of the thing I learnt listening to conversations are, how to tell when a girl or a boy is intersted in me, or what are the toughts that my brain flags as important in people's conversations, one of the main topics I constantly pick up, is whether I'm gay or not, maybe bi, or straight, or even asexual, I recently came to the conclussion that I'm bi-demisexual but I'm not 100% sure yet, I still doubt if I'm just gay, or bi to be more precise.

The more recurring thought really is that I'm actually gay, but that doesn't convince me, I dont know if I'm just deep into HOCD, or all of this is just the actual discovery of my sexuality, I don't feel comfortable at all about being gay, I love woman, I love soft-flirting with girls, my attention when there are girls in a party comes to them, not the boys, but I can be alone with a girl or a boy who's clear intention is to kiss me and I wouldn't have any problem about kissing any of those genders, I have a lot of trouble making the decision of just going for it tho, but trust issues maybe are for another subreddit.

I really don't know what to think, I'm 85% sure I'm bisexual but that 15% is killing me, I want to be sure about my sexuality, and I feel my body is kind of rejecting the gay part of being bi, not having a clue of the reason why. I really don't know if I'm just gay and try to overthink it to feel comfortable.

If someone can give me some insight, or have felt something similar, I could really use some advice. Or if you know some sexuality guru that has the time to read this, it would be awesome, I really need help. Thanks for reading",29Sep2020,1

36,"School work, future school plans, father's expectations, dental work, piano, housework, sleep schedules, mother issues, moving from house to house... Its becoming too much. My father seems to expect everything to be absolutely perfect despite him seeing that I am now physically unwell since I am so depressed to the point where I am always holding back my tears yet I cant cry, I can't eat without wanting to throw up afterwards, i am physically weak and get random pains all the time, and I can barely get out of bed in the morning or even get to sleep in the first place. So I am always absolutely exhausted. 

I don't go to school in person, so I really don't see any other people other than chat to them online, despite him having apps such as Qustodio to monitor and restrict everything I do, so he can pick at me if I happen to spend more time talking to others or listening to music than the day before.  Something that's been really bugging me is he expects me to answer very adult oriented job or school questions, then treats me like a bratty teenager despite me having never 'argued' with him, and then treats me like a child the moment I find something I truly enjoy before labeling that newly found hobby as an 'obsession' and going out of his way to put some sort of control on it despite me having barely been on it or doing it. In the past he has told me things such as 'stop crying, its what babies do to get attention' so I believed him, and I believed him and haven't cried since despite being in so much pain. 

I love my dad so much, and he dragged me out of a household with my mentally abusive mother, yet sometimes I wish I was still there. Or better yet, nowhere at all.

37,"I just feel so sad and pathetic lately. Last semester I did horrible in my classes and I’m really afraid that I am going to do poorly this semester too. I am trying but my only exam that I’ve taken so far I got a 70 which is not very good. I hardly studied because I didn’t feel motivated so it’s my fault entirely and I’m just so afraid that I am going to get bad grades again and flunk out of school or something.

The thing is I don’t even know why I try. I don’t know what I want to do in life. I am majoring in psychology because I want to help people like me who are suffering from mental illness or just going through tough times. But I don’t know if I would even be good at it since I did so poorly in my psych classes last semester and I don’t feel as motivated/ passionate about it anymore. I don’t know if that’s depression or if that will last and if it does I don’t want to half ass when it comes to helping others.

I also feel like I’m not really good at anything. I’m mediocre at everything. I’m just good enough, just smart enough to get by (most of the time, obviously not last semester), but I don’t feel like I am really good at anything. 

My main hobby and thing that I probably enjoy most is art, but a lot of the time I don’t even feel like I’m good at that. I’ll be so excited about an idea that I want to draw or paint and then I’ll finish it and be so disappointed. Sometimes other people say I’m good at art but I feel like they just say that because they want me to feel better.

I hardly even have any friends and the few I have I feel like I can’t be vulnerable with. I have 3 close friends and one of them is my younger brother but I feel like I can’t be open with them about my feelings, especially my brother because I feel like I have to seem strong for him and be a good role model. I just feel so alone and like nobody would understand me. I don’t know what to do anymore. I usually don’t feel this bad but lately I have been so down. I feel like I don’t even have a place in this world or a purpose. I don’t feel like I’ve made an impact on anyone’s life and if I died they would probably all get over it very quickly.

I’m on anti-depressants and long release ritilan. I got my diagnosis almost 3 years ago now and especially recently I’ve become so unproductive to the point where I failed high school.

I want to do the work and I set aside time to do it. I know why the work has to get done and what finishing it is going to do for me but I don’t get why I won’t do it. I get locked up when I attempt to start and the feeling of anxiety keeps growing to the point where I have to leave or I’ll start vomiting. I try to break it up in chunks and work on it at least days before it’s due (I was a heavy procrastinator prior-early diagnose, I would finish the work the morning it’s due). When I do start doing the work I keep “zoning out”, just keep getting lost in thought and jump around from section to section. Ultimately, even when I can get myself to do the work it takes me hours to write a paragraph. For the past 3 years I’ve only every successfully handed a project in on time 4 times. A lot of the time I don’t even hand in projects because I give up, the only reason I would pass is because I do good on tests. I went from straight 90’s in IB to barely scraping a passing grade in my regular academic courses. The feeling of anxiety keeps growing when I try to do work and it stops me from getting things done, ultimately I keep putting things off to the point where I just give up. 

These are some of the things that I’ve noticed when I do work. 

I get racing thoughts, I keep jumping around from section to section, I answer the question but I have difficulty writing it down, I blank out a lot forgetting what I’m doing, I get lost in research and can’t determine what’s relevant or not, I loose my train of thought, I physically get really jittery and itchy, I repeat myself a lot, everything distracts me (I can get lost counting the dots on my ceiling or just staring at a desk), I feel guilty and ashamed of the quality and/or quantity of work I produced given the amount of time I spent trying to do it.

I spend so much time trying to get myself to do the work that I either end up mentally exhausted by the time I start or I don’t have enough time in the day to do it (it can take me 12+ hours of just sitting and trying to start before I actually start). This problem carries on beyond work when it comes to things like making food or cleaning my room.

Is this happening because of shitty habits I have or do the diagnoses play a heavy role in it? Is this something I can fix personally (behaviour wise) or could a cause be the medication I’m taking? I’ve been trying to logic this problem out for a while but I can’t understand what’s at the root of the issue.",29Sep2020,1

This is long, sorry.

I posted about a month ago about how I've been diagnosed with Bipolar II (and some other disorders) for several years now and that I've been in treatment for a long time, but I'm not getting any better anymore. If anything, I'm spiraling down while still on the maximum doses of my medications. We keep adding more and increasing them but ultimately I'm on the decline. And I'm developing symptoms of psychosis despite being on an antipsychotic. 

So I think I might have outgrown my old diagnosis and perhaps have something else going on that's making me worse despite treatment. I can hardly function and barely take care of myself. Self care? What's that? Real food? No idea what that's like. Clean and organized surroundings? More like forgotten half-empty cups growing mold in the corners of my room. Toothbrush? I haven't really used that thing in a month. Gross, I know. I hide from the public eye. Masks are so convenient. Masks and hats. 

Anyway, I think I might have Schizoaffective bipolar type like my brother does and that my meds have masked the development of it over the years. The timing is about right, I'm in my late 20's with a history of substance abuse during my early 20's. Family and friends have told me I suddenly changed when that all started a few years. I was a 4.0 student but ever since then I can't consistently keep up with school. In one semester, out the next, some withdrawn halfway through, some failed completely and done away with by appealing paperwork. It doesn't coincide with my mood episodes. I've been hypomanic and failed those semesters. 

If things go well I could graduate next summer. But things haven't been going well at all. I've done nothing so far and we're at midterms soon. I haven't been to class in a month. I missed 3 exams, and countless quizzes and homeworks. And I still have 4 courses worth of work to do from classes dating all the way back to the spring and summer semesters. I could pull it off if I was in a good place mentally. But I'm not. 

When the Abilify wears off in the evening, the nonsensical voices in my head that almost sound real come back to bother me and drown out my own jumbled up thoughts. I can't focus or be productive like that. And I get distracted watching objects shift around. And I'm unable to function even when I'm not in an acute depression. 

I thought I was on the upswing in February but March rolled around and the extenuating circumstances of the pandemic led to so much compound stress that hasn't gone away that I'm completely worthless. I went from only hearing things sometimes and seeing stuff move at night to it happening during the day for a few days before I got help. I'm not ok.

I just don't know if I should quit before this semester goes down in my transcript. I'm so close to the finish line for my degree but is it worth it to keep sprinting on a broken leg? To keep tripping and hurting myself even more? Do I push through and get it over with or do I withdraw and get help, take time to heal, and go back later and take even longer?

I appreciate it if you made it this far. I want to know if anyone else has experienced this. Or if you have advice, or an opinion, or anything really. I have until October 16th to make a decision as to if I should withdraw and take care of myself first and I want to see what other people would do in my situation",29Sep2020,1

51,"ok. long post. i’m sorry. it’s ok if you don’t read. it felt good writing this out. TL;DR i’m seeing a psychiatrist. just wondering if literally obsessing over someone is monomania or something else. 

————————————

have sort of been having mini panic attacks on and off throughout the day. 

all my life i have been the type of person to hyper “focus” (aka obsess aka get tunnel vision) over people, in particular one specific person at a time. to the point that i’ve always jokingly compared cutting off those people to a heroin addict trying to be sober. 

i have been this way for as long as i can remember. the first person i recall was with this boy i liked in 3rd grade named austin meyers. when i was a young teen, it was mainly a celebrity. but then it became a (now ex) best friend i met in the 6th grade. we knew each other for 13 years. and now it’s my ex boyfriend. 

what happened today—

i am in an american romantics class this semester and one of the authors we are reading is Edgar Allen Poe. of course i’ve read his works in high school etc. but today during our classes webex, my professor talked about Poe’s theme of monomania in some of his stories, and in this case we were discussing Berenice. 

and my professor was talking about how the narrator was monomaniacal over this woman. and i had to leave the webex early because i started having incredibly bad anxiety because i was thinking how i felt exactly as the narrator did. it was like a switch went off in my head. 

when we originally discussed monomania he put it off as an incredible obsession over an object or task, etc. so i didn’t make the personal connection. 

i am not going to go into great lengths over this but i am just going to say that i have been quite obsessed over my ex boyfriend. 

TO BE CLEAR, we have still had frequent contact since he broke up with me and we did sleep together over the years. it’s been 4 months since we last had sex. 

i have tried to get my distance from him, bc he’s doing the single thing sleeping around whereas for me he’s the only person i’ve been with let alone kissed in 7 years. we also have a very toxic relationship, as he can be quite manipulative. 

he dumped me almost 3 years ago. but we dated for 4. so i’ve known him in total almost 8 years. he was basically my first real boyfriend. 

i know these things i’m going to say are crazy, obsessive, and stalker-like. 

but. 

i can not stop myself from checking his social media. at one point this year i was logged into his imessages, mainly to see what he was doing in general (to keep “tabs” on him and make sure he was ok, bc he was homeless for a while) and also to see what women he talked to and slept with. i have logged into his social media before. i was recently logged into his instagram. i have 1,289 photos of him, screenshots/pictures i’ve taken of messages between him and others, and just photos in general regarding him within my “hidden” folder of my phone. i think about him constantly. even during the countless times i have cut contact from him for my own well being, i eventually succumb to checking his social media. i couldn’t tell you how many times i think about him. 

thankfully i’ve never followed him anywhere or sat outside places he’s hanging out, gone to his work, etc. 

i want it to stop. but i can’t. it’s a compulsion. i think it’s the concept of monomania. i don’t know what’s wrong with me. 

i am seeing a new psychiatrist october 8th and will be telling her about these things. i am also trying to find a therapist. 

is monomania connected to any specific mental disorders? is what i’m expressing anything in particular? i am not looking to self diagnose— that’s why i’m seeking help with a licensed professional. 

i guess i just want to know if i’m alone in being an incredibly obsessed person. i used to joke and say it’s because i’m a scorpio but it’s such a cop out. i feel like i’m alone in being this way. 

is this “normal” behavior of a grieving person moving past someone they thought was their soulmate? do you think these compulsive actions will stop? is this a form of autism? (i have ADHD and dyscalculia but i have never been diagnosed with mental health conditions other than depression). 

i’m so tired of this. it’s like self harm.",29Sep2020,1
52,"I talked to my mom today and told her what my college counselor and I discussed. Obviously he didn't want to like diagnose me or anything. But he did help me find some sliding scale therapists. And I told my mom about how I've been discussing my symptoms with other women who have PMDD and a few of them also had ADHD and said that's what my problem sounds like. Again NOT trying to diagnose myself I just need to find a therapist to discuss if that's the answer. Even if it's not I need skills to deal with these issues. And my mom's like ""isn't that just anxiety?"" ""Dad makes too much money for any kind of discount"" (we're in a lot of debt tho so that's the problem). ""Your grandpa had to keep moving all the time, it's just a different kind of anxiety."" And my friend was like ""Ugh no- that's probably ADHD and then you know it's probably hereditary"".

55,"my mom thinks every bad thing I feel (ex. sleeping too much or eating too little) is because of my psychiatric medication - which I wrongly stopped taking since 2 months ago, so obviously it's not because of that (maybe it's because of my depression?? but she doesn't believe in mental health so obviously it's not that). She always tries to find a way to say her opinion as if she knew a lot about medicine (I need to say I go to med school so yes, I know how meds work and I know she has a really messed up idea of that but she doesn't believe in me)

56,"So, basically, title says it all. Will try to make this not too rambly and ranty!

Basically, im scared as fuck about getting old. I'm 30 years old, have suffered from mental health issues in the past, severe depression in my mid 20's and I attempted to take my own life when i was 24.

The result of this has been im now quite self aware of my own mental health, i can realise when im feeling overwhelmed etc and usually rectify the situation myself. But i cant do that with these feelings. 

When i objectivley think about my past, my teen years until now, its been pretty damn good. Lots of friends, girlfriends, holidays and good memories. I look back and think about stuff i have done or experienced, or have a few beers with friends and talk about the stupid shit we did. The happy feeling looking back lasts all of 10 seconds before its replaced with a deep sinking feeling in my stomach and i start to pick a part everything ive done or didnt do. Over analyse everything and anything, think about the summer of 05 where during the school holidays i played WoW for 5 weeks and make up loads of stuff i probably missed.

Think about the year i spent in a shitty relationship not seeing my friends and tell myself thats probably why my friend group is so small now. 

In my late teens / early twenties i was the life and soul of the party, i based my own self worth on how many people liked me. Its all i cared about. Now im 30, my friend group is small, we have a lot more commitments, jobs, long hours, partners, kids, mortgages. My lifes amazing really, i bought my first house last year, my partner and i are expecting our first child this year. 

But i just cant escape looking back, even at happy times with nothing but regret, and then looking forward with nothing but dread, often creating imaginary scenarios that most likely will never happen that just circulate like a storm cloud in my head that almost completely kills ALL motivation in my current life.

I said i wouldnt make this too ranty / rambly but i have failed at that. I dont even know why im writing this, maybe to see if anyone else has ever experienced anything like this or has any techniques or ideas that might help. 

Its like 5am where i am so im gonna sleep, but ill check back on this post when i wake up.

About an hour after that, me and my GF (23F) just had sex and she saw the notification on my credit card about an onlyfans charge. As you could imagine, it caused a huge fight and I took responsibility for my actions. One thing she asked me, was if she could look at my credit card statements to see if it was a one time thing. I am a very private person, and this simple request has been tearing me to pieces. 

Fast forward to today, we had been doing pretty good and she asked me to show the statements again. She said I need to man up and do it “rip the bandaid right off and show me” is what she said. I feel like my privacy is gone if I do that. I don’t know why I feel this way about my phone, there’s nothing to hide but I feel like it’s my whole life in this stupid ass phone. 

Can someone please tell me if I am in the wrong about my privacy and showing bank statements? I know that I fucked up, I don’t know why I did.

61,"(Not a native English speaker) 

I'm not sure if anyone can really help me with this, but I'd like to talk about it and get some insight from others.

I always thought I was introverted. I always hated going to kindergarten and school. Sucks being forced to see people I hate. I also was always told I'm too shy and stuff. (I know, shyness =/= introversion) I had few friends if any at all and didn't mind not meeting up with them.

I also had a avoidant personality disorder for all my life. For those who don't know, it's pretty close to social phobia, with deeper roots.

What's super weird to me, is my friend who definitely doesn't have social phobia always refuses opportunities to get to know new people over discord, while I'm hyped to do so. Don't get me wrong, it's hard af for me! My heart is pounding, I'm sweating and trembling, but I still love it. Often I need a break afterwards (= introversion?), but only after I already cooled down. Getting hyped while meeting them actually makes me ""open up"" more and makes me more open to try out stuff I wouldn't have thought I would (like playing a game with those new people. I usually don't like doing this, as I want to get to know them first)

It's also so much easier to do stuff, like going out, talking to strangers even (which is insane for me) while friends are with me, even when it's someone I don't know for long. After meet ups I'll both feel exhausted as well as full of energy and it's confusing. There's a good chance I'll clean the flat happily with energy afterwards, while it's super hard to get out of bed without ""social energy"".

I'm sorry if this is all over the place. I'm confused. I always thought I was introverted, but my introverted friend makes me doubt that. Am I extroverted and my personality disorder just made me think I was introverted for all my life?

68,"Now I know from posting on a different sub before that people are going to think ""well why are you sad over a guy that's in jail? He obviously did something so horrible that he's in there"" and yes, I get it but please look past that, hes in there under a false accusation that has to do with family and I don't want to publicly explain more because why he's in there is not important to my problems.

I'll try to make this short because I tend to ramble but since he's left, which was on the 10 of this month, it's just been unbelievably hard. I'm very dependant on a partner and I recognize that it's unhealthy but it's not something that's quickly changed but it's something that I am trying to work on during this time now that I'm faced with being on my own.

Since he's left, I've cried everyday, some days are easier, some days, like today have been hell. I'm just crying randomly. If there's a second of silence or I see his shoes in the hallway or anything I'll start crying. 

We don't know how long he's in there for, everyone is speculating 4 months because that's what the prosecutor wants but it's ultimately up to the judge so I guess the fear of the unknown is really biting me in the ass. 

I have people to talk to, albeit only 2-3 people but they are there for me but as stubborn as it really is, nothing feels good enough to fill that void that my partner filled. I know that's on me, I know that will make people think ""well then why should I try to help her, she won't be receptive to anything if she's going to be stubborn."" And I get it, but I'm honestly desperate for anything.. I don't care if it's a single uplifting message or if you want to get to know me or anything in-between. I am an open book, but that book is a complete mess right now so, I guess read at your own discretion if you so choose.

This might not gain any traction but if anyone does read this though I do appreciate it. If nothing comes of this, it still feels good to get it out and practice reaching out to people.",29Sep2020,1
69,"I’m not sure if this will do any good, but at this point I really need something to change. 

I (30m) have grown increasingly tired of not having any real direction. I have a good job, just bought a house, am engaged to a wonderful woman, and don’t have any known glaring health conditions. I’m average looking, athletic build, get along with people etc. On the surface there’s seemingly no reason not to be happy. 

Why can’t I find happiness?

I spend all day now wondering what the point of my job is, when I could care less about the field. It just makes me money. 

I try to be grateful about owning my own home, but I circle back to wondering why I’m here. I grew up 1500 miles away, but there were no opportunities for making a living there. 

I’m beyond grateful for my significant other, but at some point she won’t be able to maintain her happiness when I drag her down. 

I’m always irritable, and I haven’t felt that giddy happy feeling since I was a kid. 

I have some friends, but never get out to do anything. The friends I have here are from work, and other friends I’ve made in life are far away. The friends that aren’t here don’t keep in contact as we all lead different lives now. 

My only hobbies are upgrading my house, and occasionally video games, but nothing fulfilling. 

How do I find a passion? How do I find happiness? How to I create and nurture lasting relationships? Is something wrong with me? 

Always a million questions and no answers. Depression is always the go to self diagnosis, but could this be something more? Can a pill really fix all of this? Therapy may help, but as an American with less than stellar benefits that doesn’t seem to be an option. 

At this point something has to give or ill end up looking back and knowing I never lived, only survived. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!",29Sep2020,1
70,"Ugh, where to start.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never felt quite right, and I have always done things my way. Always questioning everything, overthinking, worrying too much. Never quite where I am expected to be, but not far away either.

I just do not get it. Acquaintance's parents, teachers, therapists... Since I was young, I have been hearing that I am smart. But I simply don't understand why.

If I am so smart, then why is everything becoming so hard? Highschool was honestly a pain in the ass I overran myself trying to get started. Anxiety became physical and I sacrificed everything around just to do my homework at 3 in the morning.

While I used to be overly enthusiastic about everything, while I used to have my fair share of hobbies, I can't do anything anymore now. I can't decide what to do anymore. I am just bored all of the time! 

I keep overanalyzing myself and I can't get out of this loop. This is just plain self-distracting. 

I keep self-sabotaging everything despite having a lot of resources. I mean, I moved to Canada a year ago and I am only 19. I do have support, but I also worked for it in some way. I felt like I had absolutely no future in France, and I grasped my chance to accomplish a dream. 

Although, to me, this is just another way to maintain the pressure. I thoughts everything would change, but in the end, I am still the exact same. I am still stuck in that weird loop where I always improve to crash in the end, and never fully recover. 

&amp;#x200B;

My first year was a mess and I can barely take school anymore. Over time, I became more and more resistant to mental effort and I started waiting endlessly as I was incapable of taking any decision. In the end, the way I came back to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I was then referred to a psychiatrist but now that I started a bullet journal again and fixed my sleep, I improved a little! I am finally able to take notes after classes! And I am planning on doing this ahead of them as all the resources are online.  

Apparently, I am fine, I am managing. Apparently, I am smart, self-aware and know what I am doing. But I really do not feel like so. I feel like I keep my life at the minimum and I really would love a little more. Though, I might be overthinking. 

The thing is my whole life revolves around being in the best mind place to be ready when I feel like it, and I find it frustrating. I would like a hobby or two, but I can't introduce anything without feeling overwhelmed. 

I am waiting most of the time, but do not desire to.  Meanwhile, I am failing the only class that requires me to be attentive and devoted. And I know I need to do more than just skimming through PDF and making notes of that. I know I should study a little if I don't want to be left behind again in a couple of weeks.

But I don't believe I am capable of this. I am too tired. Anxiety has not been physical for a while, but I still feel I am sinking. Nothing seems that pleasurable anymore, and I still can't connect with others easily. In the end, I destroy that as well. I self-sabotage. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's weird but I refuse to admit that anxiety does not define me. I know I am the only person responsible for my happiness but I am still lost. I don't know what I am searching for, nor what I want. I don't know what to do... Without regular therapy sessions, I would explode. Anxiety always spirals out of control and despite improving momentarily, I really do not reckon I am getting better.",29Sep2020,1

This might be a little unorthodox but here we go:

I’ve been doing therapy for about 5 months now roughly for attachment issues and depression issues. Long story short, I have a long history of having attachment issues relating to romantic relationships, and it’s always been hard but 6 months ago I went through a break up of 4 years, and it’s just been different this time. Maybe because I started realizing that I had deeper rooted issues that had never been addressed and it’s now been extremely difficult dealing with all of the things that come along with having an extremely anxious attachment style and being very codependent. Anyways, for about 5 months I’ve found it sometimes helpful to put my thoughts onto paper, notes in a way, like a journal of my head in its rawest form.

We've known each other for about 3 months now, instantly hit it off and in a week we were dating. Of course this being a long distance relationship and all it was difficult. But boy was it great. She wanted to move to England in a few years too which was a great coincidence.

Now recently she got into some online beef. Some guy posted a fake article joking about stabbing someone, she commented on how disrespectful it was, got into an argument , and she accidentally sent a meme calling him a fag (I'm bisexual), so is she.

She apologised, but then got basically harassed by a crap ton of people calling her the homophobic queen and to kill herself etc, she's bipolar keep in mind.

91,"Separation and divorce can be exhausting and cumbersome and takes a huge toll on your mental health. Sometimes, in a relationship, a couple may reach a point of no return and no amount of couple therapy can save the relationship. In such a time, even [couple therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/couples-therapy/) advises cutting dead ends loose for personal growth and peace of mind. Can a couple always overcome problems? Most of the time, but when it is beyond the capabilities of even a professional to help, it may be time to call quits. It can be overwhelming to deal with a divorce, yes, but what can you do to maintain your calm and peace of mind even in the face of a divorce? Here are some tips from a couple’s therapist on what to do if your partner wants a divorce, no matter what the reason. 

**Stay Calm, Be Positive** 

This may seem like a no-brainer and advice from a child who does not know the hardships of adult life. However, even therapists first advice you to stay calm. Why? Calmness can help you think clearly and filter out the overbearing emotional aspect of the situation and focus on the practical. Remind yourself that you probably tried your best to fix the problem and you have exhausted the list of “could Be’s” and “should haves”. Be positive and tell yourself that it is not the end of the world and that your life will go on. 

**Be Open to Discussions** 

Banging the door in their face, ignoring their calls and texts, and ignoring their existence in general will only fuel your anger and increase the sourness of the separation. A [marriage and family therapist](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/couples-therapy/) would advise you to communicate as it can open up new doors of learning and understanding exactly what is wrong with your dynamic and having clarity on the separation can help you gain closure. Talk. Get the facts right. 

**Do not Blame Each Other** 

Pointing a finger, yelling, and calling blame on each other will only further damage your relationship and force y’all to end the relationship on a sour and bad note. Do not blame one another and push each other away. Use your separation and time apart to re-evaluate what you two had and reflect on what may have caused the problem. Be open to accepting responsibility for what you may have done wrong and cross-check to see if anything is potentially worth fixing. Reflection and introspection can go a long way. 

**Be Open to Professional Help** 

Yes, it helps, beyond leaps and bounds. One of the biggest benefits of consulting a mental health professional is that they can make you see the aspects of your own life and relationship that you may have not been able to see. There are many different forms of therapy that can help you cope with your problem in a healthy way. [Group therapy](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/speciality/group-therapy/) is great for individuals who want to connect with other individuals who are facing similar problems. These individuals can play the role of a sounding board and help you get in touch with your emotions and thoughts in a safe and organized way. Individual therapy gives you the luxury of one-on-one communication with your therapist.",29Sep2020,1

so to avoid all of that i’m pretty sure i have started to sabotage my life in order to force myself into suicide at the end of the summer next year.

97,"Alright, so I decided to make this post, as I have been experiencing this issue for quite a while now i.e as long as I can remember. And, the issue specifically often comes to play during my exams, to be even more specfic, my math exams.Now, the issue I'm having could be just denoted into two parts, but those two are not that different imo. 1st problem, I have trouble reading the question carefully, and that doesn't mean I can't read it carefully, it's that sometimes, I just don't(will go into more details, this is just a rough overview for now). 2nd problem, I often times don't think properly/carefully about the answers, again it's basically the same gist here, I can do it, but I'm very *excited* in a way, which I think could be the reason, as to why sometimes I don't think carefully about my answers.

Right, now that I have hopefully given you a decent estimation of my problem, let me try to make it more clear, if isn't clear enough with an example(for each problem).

Today, we had a test, a math test, well we did have a test after that as well, but that isn't really the concern here. Ok, so in that math test, there were 2 questions, and the way I answered them/solved them, imo almost perfectly interprets my problem. So, I answered one of those two questions, of which I know I could've answered correctly, but didn't because, I didn't read it properly. And, the second one was I didn't think about it properly.

Now, there could be other explainations as to why this happened, one of them could be, that as why I was in a call, with a few of my other friends(3/4 of em', and there were more but, they weren't in that call) and they were discussing about the answer, and actually wanted the answers as they didn't have it themselves. Generally, I'm the one to help them(which I know isn't really a good thing to do, but let's not talk about that rn), so maybe I was overwhelmed by this sort of pressure, just having to get it done quickly to give them the answers. Or, it could be that time was running out, and that was the reason this happened. However, if one of these two hypothesis is correct, I feel like it would've probably only caused me to answer the latter question(out of the two I mentioned) incorrectly. As, while answering the first one, I had full confidence in my answer, without seemingly even reading it properly.

Can anyone give me any tips to solve these issues? Or just deal with them better? Any sort of assistance/feedback would be appreciated. Tysm!",29Sep2020,1

This tore my dads side of the family apart, he even waiting outside my instructors house with an axe, planning to take his life. Around this time my mother and Step-Father also split up. my mother told me he was going for business, as he was a pretty well known artist in the area he used to live and got commissioned fairly often for murals and such. about 2 months later, my naïve brain finally caught on to the fact that he wasn't coming back. I haven't heard from him since, and my heart hurts. this man was so formative to my creativity and my excitement for day to day life! and one day, he was just gone. now my mother and him are finally finalizing their divorce. I asked her if she could ask if I could visit him or meet him up somewhere. apparently he isn't very interested in seeing me. that hurts a lot. 

back to my dad's side of the family: We went from being a family that always had parties and friends around to nothing. no time with my dad, not seeing my step mother much, my dad being in a pure rage and sadness. my aunt got into meth and lost her mind, still is around to this day, occasionally trying to kill my grandmother, grandfather, and father. she occasionally will cut brake lines to the vehicles and loosen lug nuts on the tires. she developed some sort of schizophrenia on top of her meth addiction and lost her two children to my uncle (not the father). he took them in and disrupted his whole life just to take care of those two kids. one was molested by a family friend and after therapy went to live with her father, since he's all she talked about. for a long time I had no contact with my cousins. one who I can contact now and will be moving close to see soon and the other still no contact.   

After a while of living with my mother, I was manipulated in a sense to go and live with my dad, being told my mother was mistreating me. Eventually, my mom broke, and came back to my dad as she still loved him. that failed miserably. 3 times. after the second breakup, my mother left and moved to Florida with a man that physically and emotionally abused her. around this time I came to discover the lies surrounding me. Every adult in my life has betrayed me or someone close to me. even my dad, the man I aspired to be. he manipulated me for so long. so Damn long. he tricked me into believing my mother didn't really care about me. he told me he was the only one I should trust. he constantly made me feel bad, attacking my person, never spending time with me. we weren't great on money either. power went off every few months for a few days, my house rarely had heating throughout it and entertainment was hard to come by for us. He was a liar. he spent all the money for those things on meth. I found out for myself a while back when i found 3 or 4 broken meth pipes in the creek in my back yard and one above the ceiling tiles. I tried asking him 4 or 5 times and he would always throw me off by making me feel awful for even accusing him of something like that. I don't have the time to explain everything he has done, or lied to me about, or how often he purposely made me feel like shit just to keep me beat down. I became so frustrated and confused that I even used to slam my fists into my skull when I was angry(learned behavior from dad), it's the only way i knew how to deal with it. i didn't want to hurt anyone, or any objects i cared about, so why not me, right? I finally stopped that after I hit my head so hard that my right arm started twitching. it still twitches occasionally, and I'm pretty sure I've done nerve damage to myself. 

the other day he went into the bathroom, and as the door shut, I saw a baggy fall off of his back. he didn't notice it, so he went upstairs afterwards. I went into the bathroom to see what it was and in my hand I held about what I'd guess was about $120 worth of meth. that's why we don't have food? are you kidding me? is this why my mother left? (yes, and luckily she freed herself from its bonds.) In that moment I had to make the conscious decision to either flush it, leave it for someone else to find like a child, or to throw it back into his room before he got back. And I chose to throw it back. I didn't want him to spend more money on it. he already spends enough on it, and I wont be part of the reason my sisters wont eat. I think that broke me though. 

I don't feel angry, sad, or anything about his problem anymore. I simply just don't care anymore. And that scares me. I don't want to become a stone cold bastard. what if that's just the start to me losing it? what if I become like my aunt or my father? I have to be better; and I know I am in heart and soul. but I can't actually cry anymore and sadness just caused cold chills through my body. When my brain imagines possible situations socially or emotionally to go wrong, and I become extremely sad, as if it already happened. like, no amount of reason or logic can get me out of it, I just become sad. I don't want to be sad or angry anymore. I used to be so loving and happy and selfless. I feel like a husk of who I once was. I don't trust anyone anymore and feel like I'm constantly being lied to. I don't even feel like the person I call my best friend cares about me. I think I'm alone. people say that I'm not alone, but is it true? I don't feel like I have any friends to help me or that care. I wish that I didn't have to think like this, or have trust issues, or have to contemplate what to do with my dad's bag of meth. 

to be clear, I'm not suicidal or anything, I'm just a young man hurting, and I know I need help.",29Sep2020,1

103,"So, to explain the situation, i am a Brazilian 19 year old, and have been dealing with a lot lately, feeling lonely, worthless and anxious.
Growing up as the youngest on a toxic and chaotic family of four i always felt the need to be the stable one kinda mending the cracks between us, however my parents and brother always had heavy mental problems, my father is extremely bipolar, narcisistic and was never positive, always disregarding my brother and i as his children and always blaming every single problem in his life on us using us as stress relief toys, the same goes for my mother, although i do love her to death, her having tdhd and extreme anxiety coupled with constant daily fights with my father would end up leading her to do the same to me and my brother,  despite those problems, the times when everything was calm she would be an amazing and loving mother, as an effect of all of this my brother did suffer a lot aswell sinking into an awful depression that affects him to this day, needless to say i also ended being a punch bag for him, with him doing the same things my father would.
Through all of that i always kept smiling and acting like i was completely fine supporting every single one of them and trying to keep the family together all on my own until my parents got divorced, something that turned out to be a blessing because they would no longer fight at all as they would not see each other anymore (at that time i was 16 and my brother 21).
During middle and high school i was never completely alone but i only had one actual friend that i used to consider a brother until he completely betrayed just recently but thats a whole other story, having a very ""manly"" and ""angry"" face didnt help me at all because people would litteraly be scared to approach me not because i was ugly but because i wasnt really inviting, so seeing that people would already prejudge me before i even talked to them i decided to stick to that persona wich really isn't me but honestly i just couldn't bother changing that since i had bigger problems at home and my mind was always full with that, so i ended up being very lonely through my teenage years.
The first time i went to a psychiatrist was last year and i had a complete break down because i always kept everything inside me and would never talk about  it with anyone since i always tried to convince myself i was fine and was just being petty everytime i had negative thoughts, so after a long session with him i ended up being diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety and ocd after that i started taking medication and things got better over time, that was until i dropped out of college since i was doing it only because of my parents and my social anxiety was killing me.
So nowadays im just stuck home most of the time in bed not having the motivation to do anything felling lonely, worthless and depressed, luckily it was never hard for me to go out with girls so i tried dating some girls but most of them only wanted sex and nothing serious but that just made me feel used and even more worthless, to add insult to injury i ended up losing all interest in sex, i can't even get a proper erection anymore.
To be honest i tried to occupy my mind with hobbies and study but It just didn't work and im honestly finding suicide the best option right now.",29Sep2020,1
104,"So my boyfriend broke up with me because he doesn‘t want to be together anymore. I accept that. What i don‘t accept is the way he did it.

106,"Background, I am currently in medical residency and have been on a couple of difficult inpatient rotations working upwards of 70 hours a week. I also have many more responsibilities as I am supervising junior residents. I also have ADHD, depression, and epilepsy (the latter showed up in medical school) and take meds for all of these as well as some supplements.
My diet is not great and I do eat a lot of processed stuff, fast food, etc. and consume a lot of caffeine usually in the form of diet soda. I also don't really exercise on a regular basis. My wife wants this to improve, which is fine, but she thinks that ALL of my problems can be treated with diet and exercise changes and then I won't need any medications...
I find this extremely frustrating because no matter how many times or different ways I explain it, she doesn't understand how hard things were for me before meds. She reads posts by Dr Victor Sorrentino who says that depression is all from diet and can be fixed through diet/exercise. I have a family history of depression, multiple family members have attempted suicide, so it's not something to be taken lightly.
I also find it aggravating how she blames my fatigue on my diet/lack of exercise and not on the extremely difficult job I have.

I found myself in an executive position of a large group at my college, several thousand members. It's a wonderful tight knit community for the most part, and it does a great job of building community.

While laying awake all night due to the side effects of my meds, I realized I want to set up a system to help those in my community that are struggling, and are afraid to look for help. I want to reduce the stigma and fear of talking about ones problems, and create a support system. 

My question is what are ways to build this system? We have attachment to a counseling center through the school, so I want to spread awareness of that, and I want to set up support groups for students that might be interested in that. 

I know those things helped me when I was at my lowest, but I also realize that it's different for everybody, so I am coming to you for ideas in things I can set up to help as many people as I can.

119,"Hi, so I'll try to keep it short and try my best to explain my situation.

I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for most of my life. I've been medicated for the last 6 years. For the last five years, I've been on one medication and it helped me a lot. In the last couple of months, I started to feel worse so my psychiatrist wanted to switch my meds. To do that I had to lessen my doses until I was of the first medication. And I felt much better when I stopped being on it. 

Now I don't know what to do. I haven't started to take the new meds because I'm not sure if I should. I feel better... but I don't really know what it means to feel ""normal"" ... I don't remember what it feels like, so I'm not sure if I should be starting the new medication or not. Maybe it will make me feel better ... but what If I feel worse again.  I will not be able to see my psychiatrist till a month from now. 

I'm sorry if it makes no sense, I'm trying to explain it the best that I can.

What does it feel to feel ""normal"" (not depressed I guess )?

How will I know if I'm not depressed anymore?

Did you ever feel better after you stopped taking your medication?

What do you think about this situation?

122,"! DISCLAIMER: mentions suicide !

Skip to the end for the Question. 

I’ll try to keep this short. So the past few years I’ve struggled. My home situation was never that good. Yes, I had a roof over my head and a both my parents but their demeanor towards me was never good. My issues mainly started when I was 8. I was a big kid and losing weight was what I obsessed over at the time. During this time I was a fairly smart kid so getting a bad grade was what pushed my parents over the edge. They started keeping me from school to study. This my first time thinking about suicide. Just the circumstances I couldn’t take it. Later on I was bullied for being stick skinny and also bullied by my principal. My experiences with that particular principal still gets me emotional til this day. I was sent to therapy but I feel they did more damage than good. At 12, I became suicidal again. This time I thought it was the end. I was almost about to end it but something stopped me. Fast forward home life was not getting any better. I got a boyfriend my second year of HighSchool and everything was going well. I saw him as the light. Everything could be wrong but at least I had someone.  Then during my junior year in crashed. Failed my Honor Anatomy and Physiology class. This made my parents furious. I wasn’t able to see my boyfriend or go outside at all. I found myself going back to my old ways. At that point I really thought it was the end. But I realized I had so much to live for. I keep saying “this is it” but I got through it. I imagine all the people I wouldn’t of met or the experiences I wouldn’t have had. Now I’m 18, still having family problems but nothing I can’t handle. I aspire to become a Child Life Psychologist or a Medical Lawyer. Even til this day I get flashbacks (idk if you would call it PTSD) oh those times when I was 8, 12, and 17. I’m in the process of healing and I just want to accept myself. In order to fully heal I think I need professional help. Last time I mentioned getting help, my mom threatened to put me in a mental institution.

Hi again!

I’m Noreen Choudhri, clinical psychologist with 7+ years of experience (Owner &amp; Founder of Made in Mind,  Rajasthan, Jaipur)
For my previous post ( on a different subreddit) I received so much of appreciation and response (also an award 😊) which motivates me to do this.
Based on the common complaints and strategies I have suggested people with mental health issues. 
I will be giving you one tip on a weekly basis that you can implement in your day to day life. 
Also try it for at least a week or 10 days consistently to see any improvements. 
It may work for some and may not work for others. 

Tip 1 STOP TRYING TO STOP OR CONTROL YOUR NEGATIVE THOUGHTS 

It is not possible to stop or control your thoughts.

A lot frustration stems from trying to control your thoughts.

Thoughts  come and go. Trying to control what thoughts occur when, or trying to stop certain thoughts from happening altogether, is a poor use of your time and energy.

Try this Experiment-  Try NOT to think of a PINK ELEPHANT, it actually makes it more likely that you will. It’s called Ironic process theory, and refers to the psychological process whereby deliberate attempts to suppress certain thoughts make them more likely to surface.

What you can do or learn to do is accept that you can’t control thoughts, develop the skill of observing mind-made activity (thought production) without getting caught up in it. 

With consistent practice, you’ll discover for yourself that the content of your mind does not matter. What matters is how you let it affect you. 

Thoughts and emotions are like clouds floating across the sky: instead of getting lost in them, you can choose to watch them come and go.",29Sep2020,1

134,"I am in my senior year of college and feel even stupider than when I went in. I am a psychology major who has been struggling with anxiety and depression since high school and I feel like it just keeps getting worse. I feel like I am not good at anything I do and I feel like I'll never make enough money to be happy.  Everyday I struggle with getting out of bed and going to class or going to work and I feel so small and belittled. Small everyday tasks such as eating are a struggle for me.  I am stuck in the mindset that I will never be enough, never be good enough, never amount to anything. I have always been treated like garbage by the people around me and my employers. I look around at the people I went to highschool with and I feel like even the ones that almost failed out are living a better life than me and are more financially stable than me. Growing up all I wanted was to have a job I loved, to be financially stable, married with kids, and just generally happy by 25 and I am nowhere near that goal. I feel like time is running out and I no longer see myself living past 25. I no longer have a plan on what to do and I feel like I have no idea what I am doing at all. When I am not at work or in class I am panicking because I feel like I am not doing enough to better myself and better my situations, but I don't know how or what I can do to better them. Video games have been the only thing making me feel okay, but recently I have realized that I just use them as a distraction. I have never felt comfortable anywhere I am and I don't even know how to relax anymore because I am constantly panicking in my head about something. I continuously isolate myself from my ""family"" and ""friends"" to the point where I believe if I finally ended it, no one would even bat an eye because they knew it was coming. The majority of the time all I can think about is how the stress is never going to end and I will never be enough and I will eventually end up falling victim to the dark thoughts that hound my psyche everyday. I've been wanting to kill myself for years, but I can never bring myself to do it because of the people around me. I want to go to counseling, but I do not and cannot afford medical insurance. 

I hate the current situation I am in. I went to college because I thought it was going to give me a better life, but instead I feel like it hurt me more than it has helped me. My mental health as declined rapidly and I am not doing what I want to do anymore. I originally wanted to be an anesthesiologist, but the college I went to told me they got rid of their pre-med program so they put me in pre-nursing, which turned out to be the hardest and most stressful semester of my life. From there I wanted to become a CIS/CIT major, but they basically told me I was too stupid and would have to make up math classes putting me two years behind, even though I have been building and messing around with computers since I was 8 years old. So, I went with psychology because I've always been interested in the way people feel and wanted to help people and the people I went to highschool/worked with always vented to me about their problems. I wanted to be a therapist, but unfortunately, I haven't learned how to be a therapist. I feel like I have wasted 4 years of my life just to end up doing something I can't do, because in order to be a therapist you have to have a masters. I barely had the money to go for my bachelors degree, so I know I won't have enough to go for my masters. Fast forward to the end of my college career and I am struggling everyday with writing APA papers and doing research because it's not something I wanted to do. On top of that, I am struggling trying to find the time to focus on my classes because of work and my anxiety and depression. I am extremely worried that after I graduate, if I even make it to graduation, that I won't even be able to find a job in my field or even make enough money to survive. I feel like I completely fucked up. I genuinely want to give up, but I can't because of the people around me and because its like I have a strong will to succeed, even though I feel like I never will succeed at anything. I do not want to be a failure, but I feel like a failure everyday.

I feel upset and apologetic for even posting this because I know there are people out there with harder lives and here I am acting like a little bitch who can't keep it together.",29Sep2020,1

136,"I know its self sabotage. I start hating my friends so I isolate myself and feel miserably lonely and eventually kill myself - thats my mental illness's goal right? It's so frustrating how if I know someone for too long I genuinely start despising everything they do or say. If they don't entertain me every time I speak to them I literally get the urge to beat the shit out of them. (Don't worry, these are online friends so I can't hurt them even if I wanted to, which I don't as I'm not a violent person). I don't get why. I hate being filled with hate, especially for people who are supposed to make me happy. They annoy me so much and they're not even doing anything wrong. God, annoy is such a tame word. Speaking with these people fills me with unbridled rage and I have no fucking clue why. They make me want to smash my head against a wall.

On the other hand, friends I don't despise I'm obsessed with. I depend on them for emotional support, and a lot of the time I need them as the antidote to killing myself. If something upsetting happens and I can't speak to them immediately, I default to self harm. I dream about spending the rest of my life with them (platonically) to get through the day. It makes me feel parasitic and like I'm using them for free therapy. I feel evil. 

This isn't my true feelings about other right? Why am I being so hateful and rude? How do I make it stop? Am I genuinely just a horrible person? Why can't I care about these people? AND WHY CAN'T I FUCKING KEEP A THERAPIST FOR THAN A MONTH AT A TIME I FEEL INSANE",29Sep2020,1
137,"I (28M) was recently discharged from emergency psychiatric detention after expressing an increase in suicidal ideation, without plan or intent. Such a hold, if one is unaware, necessitates a 72 hold period of observation, followed by a physician sign off for release. 

This measure was taken after a trusted friend and I had a conversation about how I was feeling. The context of said conversation was one appropriate to disclose my thoughts of increasing suicidal ideation. This friend is close, and has been aware of and part of my support system for dealing with OCD and MDD. My health took a turn for the worse a few weeks prior, seemingly unprompted, and following the eagerly plan I had in place as outlined by my primary doc, of which my friend has a copy, I escalated care. More appointments with my therapist, as well as with my psychiatrist, up to twice a week. In this plan, I was encouraged to voice how I was feeling to my support network, including my friend, who all had copies of my safety plan and were aware I had taken steps to escalate care to address my needs. I was making headway, but, on a particularly dark morning for me, something I must have said apparently caused my friend to worry. Instead of calling my doctors, as outlined in the plan, or calling me and discussing the matter more, I received a visit from police 20 minutes after our conversation. I explained everything, that I had no intent or plan to harm myself, and was following my safety plan. However, and I quote, “Your friend sounded tearful on the phone. I’d sleep better at night if we took you in.”

I should mention that I myself am an MD, though I do not practice (I do research). These officers do not have a background in healthcare, nor does my friend. But in the strength of her say so, and their “gut” my rights were taken away. I had little time to give notice to my boss, and therefore have been put on probation. This has also resulted in a waste of about $15,000 of equipment time and reagents necessary for the experiments I planned to conduct during my hold, which, due to the slow court system, the backlogged hospital system because of COVID, and the weekend, amounted to 137 hours in detention without my phone or access to email. These reagents are now ruined, and my career is in jeopardy. 

I am also humiliated. Close to 30 neighbors witnessed me being loaded into a police car, some of whom work at the research institute  I am employed, and word has gotten out. 

I find myself in a ball of fury, fear, and admittedly, some paranoia. I dread every knock at my door and am too embarrassed to even step outside. I know my friend acted out of concern, but it was misplaced. And for that I can’t help, however immature it may seem, and likely is, but feel hurt, even betrayed. This was my biggest fear, now realized. And my time there....truly horrific. I don’t know how to begin processing what has happened to me. 

I am scheduling follow up appointments with my docs- but I’m left here in a haze in the meantime. 

Any thoughts, advice, encouragement, would be so very much appreciated.

I can't exactly tell if it's on which one so I'm just going to say both for now .

All I want to do, all day every day, is sit in front of my computer, watching TV shows or playing video games, and blow all of my money on junk food, booze and weed. Whenever I try to do anything of any value, my brain will throw a barrage of thoughts at me, about how it's all pointless and I'm a bad person.

As soon as she stepped out of the house, i got my blade out made a deep cut on my left wrist, enough to have lots of blood oozing out. After a while i started to feel really weak and dizzy and light headed. I'd planned on jumping off my balcony on the tenth floor if cutting didnt work. I was so determined to end it all. But then, my mom came back home in about 20 minutes because apparently she had left her phone at home. She found me and then rushed me to the nearby medical centre. There they wrapped my wrist in some bandages and eventually i stopped bleeding, so I didn't need stitches. I got to go home after a few hours, I live in india and there's no system here where people that attempt suicide are sent to some kind of psychiatric hospital. I feel so fucking terrible right now. I slashed my left wrist and that shit hurts so fucking much. I hate being alive. I genuinely think i should've died. I definitely would've jumped off my balcony if my mom hadn't returned. There's no point of me being alive. There's no one in the world who's life is connected with mine. Everything would've been just the same even if I'd succeed that night.

153,"Hello, everyone. This is my first time posting and my first time in this subreddit. I only thought of going here after what happened today.

I (f19) have always been shy and reserved, and I’m often afraid of the public eye. I have been trying to battle it by trying to be brave, but it only works sometimes. Well today, my sister and I went to eat out at a fast food restaurant, and due to covid, the table and chairs inside the store was a bit limited and the lady working there had led us to a seat on the outside patio. I was alright with this arrangement, but my sister, who was with my 6-month old nephew asked me if i could ask this couple sitting inside if theyre done with their meal. 

They were done, but they were on their phones. And the moment she asked me i panicked. My head was screaming “please dont make me do this” and my mind became numb but also loud with negative statements “like what if they will be angry at you? What if its rude? You’ll embarrass yourself” and i started fidgeting with my nails, something ive never done before. And my sister was looking at me expectantly and i just felt i didnt want to disappoint her.

Then to stop my fidgeting, and to gather courage, i went to wash my hands. But then i felt even worse and more awkward and then i put myself in another awkward situation where i have no choice but to face the couple because i cant just stand in front of the sink for too long.

Well the couple left shortly after on their own. And i sat in their seat. And i just felt so disappointed. And scared. And stupid. And I dont know whats wrong with me. And then i broke down crying. Not full on sobbing, but i crying silently trying to hide it. My sister just looked at me shocked. She has social anxiety and i know i was putting her in an uncomfortable situation too, so i tried to stop myself but i ended up being worse. And we just ate in awkward silence. Ad i hated it.

I just want to know, if anyone has ever experienced something like this too. Because i have never felt what i felt today in my entire life and i just feel so stupid and disappointed in myself.",29Sep2020,1

I am a 40 year old woman diagnosed with Early Onset Parkinson's, Panic Disorder, PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder and Dissociative Seizure Disorder. 
I have had what many might consider an arduous journey as my illness has progressed. I have had severe down moments and wonderful moments of achievement where I felt that I was able to feel a surge of the possibility of how strong I could be.
When I was first noticing symptoms that were affecting my life, I was misdiagnosed with MS. At the time I weighed 436 pounds. I read that exercise was the best therapeutic treatment. I now weigh between 150-160, where I fluctuate on a constant basis. 
I have maintained this for 7 years now. 
Newly diagnosed with the early onset Parkinson's due to my progressive symptoms, I began having severe symptoms that began effecting me in a severely physical and emotional way.
I am now on the road toward improving my symptoms with all the strength I can muster. On top of what's going on in my personal life, 2020 has been a catastrophic year for so many.
So, I am going to start a Podcast about what we, the human race are facing at this time, and how people handle their own emotional turmoil. If you are willing to submit your own personal story, please email me at straightenyoureye@gmail.com. 
If you are wondering about my interest and capacity for treating this, I have a master's degree in Mental Health, Behavioral Rehabilitation Counseling. I have a 13 year career as a Social Worker, counselor, and advocate for those who get lost in this world. 
Depending on the response, I may begin a YouTube channel. Your personal information will not be directly shared, and I will only share anything you give specific permission to dispense. 

Please know that this is a work in progress, but it is very important to me. I want to address it with the Sympathy and empathy that it deserves, as well as humor where appropriate. 

I will be cognizant of triggers and alert and address as needed. 

Once again, I thank you for anyone who feels that they can participate in sharing their life experience, as well as how they are handling things right now, with a world in turmoil. 

Have a wonderful day and please know that you are always on someone's mind. You are loved. You are important.",29Sep2020,1
167,"My brain is convinced right now that I am in severe danger. I cannot help but curl into a tight ball, all muscles tensed, teeth gritted, as I close my eyes and attempt to sleep. My consciousness weaves in and out of short, momentarily relieving bouts of drifting off followed by sharp returns to reality triggered by a shot of adrenaline because I am scared that something within my body is changing, that the danger is finally here to get me. 

The changes that I detect within me are often so negligible that a normal person would never even notice them - a slight shift in the mucus in my throat, slight movement of gas in my intestines. Sometimes, nothing within my body has to change at all to trigger the return to reality. Instead, it is the sudden feeling that I am about to gag, a feeling that I have grown all too familiar with in recent months. This feeling is completely anxiety driven - for no physiological reason I often begin to feel a gag in my throat, without actually gagging, which often sends me into a spiral of panic- more feelings of gagging - more panic, and so on. Sometimes this feeling manifests itself less in the feeling of gagging and more in the feeling that something, somewhere in my body wants to get out. Something needs to be evacuated from my body and my brain starts to fight it from leaving. I never know what exactly wants to get out because this feeling does not originate in my digestive system - it is not accompanied by nausea or stomach cramps, or any other usual cause for the feeling of wanting to release something from the body. This then gets converted into panic, which then often kick starts the gagging feeling- cue the panic spiral.

Eventually, if none of the adrenaline spikes lead to a major panic attack, my body grows tired of this heightened state of anxiety trapped in a half asleep mind, and my consciousness rises up into normal wakefulness. At this point, I realise that I am quivering from the anxiety, and it takes a few deep breaths for me to wake up fully and rid myself of the anxiety and the quivering. In the few moments of relaxation that follow, I can feel my muscles relax temporarily and feel how fatigued they are from all the quivering and the clenching. For those brief few moments, I have time to feel something other than terror -exasperation, frustration, anger. Tears well up in the eyes, because I am so sick of it, sick of the fear - but soon the anxiety returns, and I am pulled back into the present, where I am not capable of feeling or thinking about anything except the terror I have about the state of my body right there and then.",29Sep2020,1

169,"My older sister is 32 and has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for over 10 years. She's had better and worse times but now she's struggling a lot in life. She is raising her daughter alone with the father paying substantial child support and taking the daughter for 2-3 days a week. She's been unemployed for over a year, all of her previous jobs she worked in for one or two years at most at a time. She also gets monetary support from our mother and grandmother, and they both try to help in other ways - cooking food for her and sometimes taking care of my niece. Most of the time I'm not home - I moved away to university and I'm planning on settling in that city. 
I recently convinced her to go back to her psychiatrist and get back on medication after over a year long break from it. Unfortunately, with the current pandemic her doctor had to cancel the appointment. I've seen her at different stages of her life and I know the longer she doesn't take medication the worse it gets. I'm worried about her wellbeing and about my niece - without drugs she's not the most stable and has a tendency to lash out at us or her child. I already see some effects this has on my niece. She's in kindergarten now but I'm worried that when she starts school next year child services might get involved.
I wonder how best to help her get back to a more sustainable and stable way of living - possibly finding a job and maintaining a daily routine of hygiene and responsibilities. Also, how to support her when (and if) she gets back to therapy and medication. Sometimes it feels like the help she gets just convinces her to stay put - she's managing somehow so why bother changing anything. I try not to blame her or accuse her of wrongdoing because I don't want to put her down - I genuinely want her to get back on her feet.

174,"I used to be a chef for a long time. I was good at it too. I really enjoyed it and its the only time in my life I really felt *good* about myself. I think I have validation issues. At that point in my life I got so much validation from my peers, customers, family, friends. I was so passionate about what I did and the food I made, it felt like a real sense of belonging, especially with all the people whom I used to work with, whatever kitchen I was in it always became a second family. That career gave me a sense of identity which I never had previously. 

For a lot of reasons, I can't (***really*** *shouldn't)* go back into that line of work. It's not a job it's a lifestyle of 60-70 hour weeks with pay of around a 35 hour week. It's a life heavily wrapped in drugs and alcohol and i'm sure anyone who has worked in this industry can agree with me. However it made me feel alive. It made me feel like a valued human being. Like I was ***worth*** something.

I've been working in a form of music education now for a few years. I've been playing music for a long time and nobody has ever actually cared if I was playing on stage or teaching them, i've never really got a pat on the back for anything i've done. I worked ***so so hard*** to get out of the catering industry for the good of my long term health and I feel like i've just disappeared. There's nobody in my life anymore. Nobody cares about the work I do, I don't feel good at it either and it's just killing my motivation for it. Even now i'm constantly working on my theory and practical side and just never seem to get any credit for anything I do. It feels i've just been sidelined by the world. This job is so much better in terms of finance, work life balance, I get over 10 weeks off a year, but it feels like an enormous sacrifice for losing my identity.

I emailed my counselor today (online school) in an attempt for help.

I have been dealing with thoughts of self harm for a long long time. With school going full-online I don’t have any social valve for releasing my thoughts, They always say the “funniest people are often the saddest”. That quote just about sums up my school life. 

With no way to “joke” about killing myself, “There’s truth in every joke”. I have no way to release my thoughts, even though no one takes it seriously. It helped me to say it out loud. No that’s school gone full online my thoughts have bottled up. 

I recently a made a post about cutting my hand with a razor, and a few days ago I cut my mouth with a letter opener. I decided I had to seek help before I end up killing myself.

I emailed my counselor to see if I could talk about my mental health, but I’m nervous to open up about my self harm. I don’t want anything happening that isn’t necessary. I’m a straight A students and don’t want any help a receive to effect that.

So, for most of my life, I’ve had this feeling that either the rules are constantly changing on me, or I’m missing a page in the instruction manual. I feel like everyone else knows what’s going on but me. It’s hard to explain, but I’ll try. It’s kind of like trying to understand slang in a foreign language. Native speakers use the slang naturally, and it’s so hardwired in them that it’s difficult to explain to non-natives, but it makes perfect sense to them and has their whole life. It’s small things, like what to do in typical situations, how to talk to people, how to exist naturally in mundane situations. Once I learn a “rule”, it’s an “Oh, duh!” Moment, but shortly thereafter, I learn that there are amendments to this rule, and that different situations illicit a different response. This makes sense to some degree, but I am also left with a feeling of confusion, like, “So, what do I do now? What action is correct for what situation?” Absolute statements really irritate this condition, colloquialisms like, “You should always follow the Golden Rule, treat others like you want to be treated.” Okay, got it, cool, I will do this thing. But then I get hit with an event that leads me to hear, “Look out for number one” or “Tend to your own Buddha first” or “Help yourself so you may help others.” And it seems so small and obvious, but in the moment, I am absolutely shaken. My foundation has been cracked and I have to build a new world view. And this happens MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY. What the hell IS this!?

Hi i have been struggling with understanding myself for years now. My head is like an endless maze where each question and answer leads to another. Its gotten to the point that i named my brain the maze. So when you are attempting to talk with me you are conferring with the maze so please be patient as it takes time to process😁

I recently stumbled upon this subreddit while exploring the many paths the maze had lead me to. When i found this page my heart was filled with joy as i may be able to solve and escape the maze oneday.

Lets get to the point. So for the past 4-5 years i have been struggling with depression and drugs. The presure from school and my family caused my situation to worsen. Like most addicts drugs are a way out of reality for me it was a way of escaping the maze. I would use cannabis, spice, ket and acid to expand my understanding in my head. The problem was that it was only in my head and not in the physical realm. I would be physically left zombified but mentally happy. I was able to realise that at different points in the day my personality would change. Id be a straight and masculine person whod love games and rap at one point(hes called uwais). Then id be a bisexual femminine male who would love crime shows, party music male and female clothes  and chatting with friends(hes called gotty). Then there is the one i hate. This is the result of drugs and is why i urge education on drugs. Id be a straight self hating, mysogynistic evil person who loved ranting at 2am in youtube comment sections its best friend is the wall next to my bead who has to hear all i have to say every night(i call it cunt he says hes called james(the guy qt the start)). This lead me to stop abusing. Its been 3 weeks and withdrawals a bitch but ive channeld the hate towards james which for some reason makew him only come out on fridays lol.

I definitely can’t keep up faking this anymore so I either have to die or I have to tell someone. But I’ve been slowly and systematically isolating myself from my friends and family for YEARS, really ramped up in the last few months. None of my friends or family are go-to confidants anymore. We still talk but I lie to them and hide from them and sometimes ghost them for days on end. They have all gotten used to this, this was part of my plan. I don’t want anyone to miss me when I die.

But now if I am second guessing that plan I don’t know how to tell anyone? I’ll just be the weirdo acquaintance they used to be close to opening up about mental health struggles. Like the crazy guy at the bus stop telling you his life story. I’ll be THAT guy, to my own friends.

190,"I honestly don't know where to start as I'm not the type to share my feelings or thoughts to anyone, but the beginning(or the origin of when my ""problems"" began) seem to be the right place as any.

My childhood was pretty normal and our family would get by. All was well until I got to high school. Around the end of my sophomore year, my parents split and I was devastated. The only thing I remember about the dreadful year following their divorce was crying myself to sleep every night. I don't quite remember how I seemed to get out of that slump, but somehow, I unconsciously just buried everything and immersed myself in a lot of alcohol, weed, and sex. And when I say a lot, I mean I didn't know it got to the point where people actually looked at me like they see those high school bullies in movies. So pretty much a loser. But hey, I didn't give a fuck. I was 17 and everything I did made life feel bearable. By the end of high school, I got into a serious relationship and long story short, I had to move away and she dumped me after a year and some months. Shattered would be an understatement of how I felt the months after that break up. That's when it all started.

Going home from school one night, I suddenly broke down out of nowhere, got off the bus, and tried to jump in front of moving traffic. I guess it wasn't my time yet cause the car had immediately stopped. That or they just got brand new brake pads that ""saved"" me. Night terrors and anxiety attacks came flooding in. This was 6 years ago and if anything it has gotten worse. Sometimes, it becomes so difficult for me to even analyze or interpret what it is exactly I'm feeling or thinking. My mood and behavior would contradict the dark thoughts I'd have every waking hour(I mean, even in my sleep the fuckers won't leave me alone). I'd be out socializing or I could be just talking to my brother and then boom!! Passive suicidal thoughts come crashing. Why is it that I think of dying so often??

It also doesn't help that I just got out of a long-term, toxic relationship. You see, I envisioned a life with this woman despite what she did to me, but in the end she was the one that got ""tired."" A year into our relationship, I had found out that she had a sugar daddy and I was pretty much the side piece and that there were other guys involved as well. I chose to forgive her and tried to make things work to the best of my abilities, but all that trauma had gotten to me and from an outsider's perspective she was right to leave because I did become toxic. Trust was always an issue regardless of the constant affirmations or reassurance. 

My outlook on relationships and life have dwindled. Here I am now, a 25 year old deprived of sensation longing for that mental stability. Constantly thinking of death. Having night terrors, then waking up to anxiety attacks. Breaking down every now and then. They say it'll get better, but death really is enticing... Hopefully, it does get better though.",29Sep2020,1

I could see words in the air that made no sense , there was a transparent ghost girl in front of my door . I heard SO many voice , I would say there was at least 20 different voices either talking to each other, yelling, whispering, asking me questions, cursing at me, and saying mean things to me . I could not move or speak at all but I would talk in my head and some of the voices would reply to me , I heard myself as a voice sometime speaking to me or yelling , there was so many different soundtracks or music playing in the background as well , I could recognize my sisters voice, my mom, my grandmas, and my friend, but the rest were random voices of ones I don't recognize. I heard tapping on my windows and walls , knocking on my door, and the sound of the door handle being opened. any time I closed my eyes I would see scary faces or bloody / dead face or people , suddenly my door opened and my sister walked in the room, i tried to reach out to her to show her that I might be in sleep paralysis and to please wake me up, she looked at me for a few seconds and then said ""do you know what time I should wash my head ?"" I was confused but couldn't reply , she then just continued to stare at me and then out of nowhere she disappeared and the door was closed again. (I asked her if this happened as soon as I woke up, she has not left her bedroom the entire time I was laying down) eventually everything just stopped and I could move again. was this sleep paralysis? a dream? a schizophrenic episode or A psychotic break of some time? if anyone is familiar with what it's like to trip on DPH (benadryl) this was VERY VERY VERY similar to it. I have tripped on dph only 2 times but this felt like a strong dose of it, I started to worry if I taken a bunch but forgot about it (dph completely destroys your memory and thought processing) this didnt feel like a dream or sleep paralysis. I have sleep paralysis VERY frequently (I would say at least once a week) and this was different from any of those experiences that usually are similar to each other. for context mental illness runs in my family and I have struggled with mental health since middle school (i'm now 19) I was diagnosed with ""major depressive disorder with mixed features"" meaning I have symptoms from multiple mental illnesses. the psychiatrist was leaning towards BPD or Bipolar but wasn't sure bc I had symptoms from other illnesses. I was prescribed lamictal (a mood stabilizer) but I only took this for the one month prescribed and never got a refill, I also never went back to the doctor after that one diagnosis (some one was worried and called the cops on me bc I had a breakdown and the police highly suggested that I let them take me to emergency crisis counseling which lead to my psychiatrist appointment . this was months ago but I feel I have gotten a lot worse mentally since then which makes me believe this may be more than a dream . any info, thoughts, comments, etc. are highly appreciated .",29Sep2020,1
199,"My friend is looking for a bit of help and support but doesn't want to post this herself, so I'm doing it for her. You can address either me or her in the replies. Here it is:

I'll just get into it shall I? I feel like there's a chance I have 'alters'. When I first began researching, I thought that they were 'alter egos' however after looking into it, it seems alter egos can only really be made consciously? I then began to look into DID, but the more I look the less likely it seems I have it: apparently in DID you must have some level of amnesia between the alts. (I don't know many, if any, technical terms, so I apologise for that) 
            I'd love it if people could try and give suggestions as to what this may be, so I'll try and describe it. I would go to a professional however I'm really not ready for that currently. 
             I can't 'switch' by trying, however if I have switched I know? I have two other 'alters' (if that's even what they are) one of whom is able to feel so much more emotion then I. She's just very optimistic (maybe to a toxic level) and tends to be happy. My other is almost emotionless, idk. They can feel some level of emotion I think(?). I seem to be completely in the middle. 
               If I'm uncomfortable in a social situation, I often switch to the second alt I mentioned. I used to label it as a 'weird mood' but I think it's much more: it's like, I know I'm me but I don't feel, act or talk like me. I gave this 'alt' a name because unlike my other 'alt' they don't have a gender or name, and the one I gave them seemed fitting of their personality (take my use of the word 'personality' lightly, I'll explain why later). 
          The first 'alt' I mentioned already kinda had a name that just clicked with her, it's hard to explain. If I wake up as her then I tend to then flick between being 'me me' and 'her me' (will also explain later) throughout the day. Around two certain people I also switch to her, as she clicks better with them. 
            So, I don't think they're exactly personalities. I am 'me me'. The first 'alt' mentioned feels much more 'developed' then the second, we have a much better idea of who she is then we do the second 'alt' I mentioned. Unlike DID, I don't feel any amnesia, and no matter who's in control, I'm still conscious and aware that I'm 'me me', or '(Insert one of their names here) me'. It's like they become me, or influence my personality? Another reason I don't believe it's DID, or that they're even 'alts', is because I can't hear them. They aren't like other people in my head. I'm so sorry if this is making 0 sense. We all have different opinions of people, we all have different ways of expressing ourselves, different ways of speaking, acting ect. 
              Does anybody have any idea what I'm explaining? Am I on the low end of the DID spectrum? Is it OSDD? Bpd? Or am I simply describing alter egos? I'd really appreciate it if you could offer your opinions! I'll answer any questions, I feel like I'm waffling on now! Thank youu!",29Sep2020,1
200,"It’s been almost two months of this mental hell of depression + dpdr and I (23 F) just can’t keep doing this. This isn’t a life worth living. 

Two months ago I was working, making the most money I’ve ever made, creative almost everyday, comfortable in my routines, and able to play video games with friends. I was a functioning person living day to day, but after a random panic attack from the fear of dying (I had my body feel heavy after eating) I had this insane vision change that took not only my perception but a part of me. I haven’t been able to leave my moms couch even though I live right up the road, haven’t worked (living off my savings) and just don’t have the creativity/motivation to do anything anymore. It’s gone completely. 

I can’t shake this uncomfortable gut wrenching feeling I have 24/7 with the added bonus of DPDR (what my therapist thinks it is) 

How can I keep living like this? I feel like a ghost of myself. I’m so tired waking up and going on through the day trying to just shower and not cry. I keep thinking about how inhumane this is to put myself through this in hopes one day I go back to normal. I catch glimpses of feeling “better” but that instantly stops and goes back. 

I’ve been using my nails to scratch my thighs to punish and just feel something other than this.

202,"I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2, generalized anxiety, PTSD, and depression for several years. I have been on/off meds this entire time, basically in typical bipolar fashion there are a lot of side effects that don't work for me w/ the mood stabilizers but I inevitably end up having an emotional breakdown and alienating everyone I know cyclically and then try to go back on some form of medication.

I manage to keep my shit together when I'm at work though, I feel like it's the one thing that I have in my life that is somewhat positive and could be a great opportunity for me in the future. My PCP suggested that I screen for IOP and I'm doing that Thursday morning.

My question is how the fuck do I explain this time off request to my employer???? I know it's illegal to tell them my health conditions but I also don't know how to tell them why I need to be gone 3 days a week for 3 weeks and they have to accommodate that. I feel like I have to choose between this job which gives me purpose and money, or maybe finally getting some decent help for once.

Today however my sleeping cycle got a little bit better, sort of. I DID manage to sleep a little again and was able so, BUT only during daytime. Which means that now I’m completely awake at night, but fall asleep at day. I hate it here. Fuck this shit. Really.",29Sep2020,1
204,"This is hard for me to explain, since I don't completely understand it, but I have been like this for many years. I wouldn't say it has ruined my life or anything, but it is definitely I challenge I face almost everyday. I tend to hyperfocus on one thing for entire day/extended period of time, even when I know its irrational to, or that if its just wasting time.

Its usually about things that are out of my control, or due to my my young age, something I don't completely understand. For example, I used to play soccer. I had been fun, until I was injured and had to take time off. During this time off, the rest of the player my age group had gone through crucial development in the transition to a higher competition, and I missed out. Therefore, when I returned, I was no longer the best goalkeeper. It was constantly on my mind, I would practice my goal kick in my room (the swing of my leg, I mean), and would spend hours before and after school doing the same repetitive goal kick in my backyard (those times with an actual ball). It was almost an obsession. I left soccer several months ago, but other things have trapped my mind. 

Often times, here on reddit, I'll read things that I gain an obsession for. What I mean is, I'll see a post (usually on r/ relationships) and I'll question over and over again why did he/she do that, 'is he being fair?' and I'll read the comments and overthink (another thing I do too much) for hours regarding some random reddit post. I'm aware that a lot of the posts on there are made up, and that reddit is not a good sample size of the majority of people in the world, and that this is all too time consuming and pointless, but its almost like I cant help but read. I think part of why I obsess over what people do on r/ relationships is because I, being considerably young and inexperienced, do not have a comprehension of all the feelings and emotions that go on in a romantic and/or sexual relationship, so when I see something on there that I don't get (like, 'why did she do that?' 'Was he being fair to her?') it becomes an obsession of something that I must force myself to understand. Its so irrational, but its like I cant help it. 

Maybe its because I have a boring, mundane life which causes my mind to drift off and find excitement somewhere else? Maybe I have a disorder? I tend to be a worrier, so maybe I just need a simple change in personality? 

I understand that perhaps what I've typed here doesn't quite make sense to someone who's not experiencing it, but I really want help, or at least a better understanding. Feel free to ask me question in the comments if you want me to clarify anything. I'm not trying to use reddit as a diagnostic, I'm just trying to get ideas on what's possibly going on.",29Sep2020,1
205,"Hey there, so just as some background knowledge I guess I should say I'm a 22 year old male from Kentucky. Although I do have some physical problems that I was born with, life has never really been a struggle to get by. Hell even Covid has largely not caused any change in my life.

That being said, ever now and again I get hit with something like how I imagine a quiet version of a panic attack would be. If I'm not actively focusing on something my vision gets blurred and distorted while breathing get harder and my mind runs wild with everything I've done wrong. All in all I'd say I'm content and happy with my life but whenever this happens I always have the image of my single shot shotgun and box of shells in my closet and my thoughts get progressively darker towards myself. I remember when I was younger it was more like seeing a random object around the house and instantly picturing a way to hurt myself with it and the thought staying until I distance myself from the situation. As an example I remember seeing my dad's razor as a late teen and pictured breaking it to get the blades out and putting one between two teeth and slamming my jaw shut down onto it.

If I had to guess where any of this comes from I would have to suspect all the supressed emotional issues that I've bottle up and dealt with alone. Well not really dealt with, more like put to the side and ignored until I stopped feeling anything about it. That all comes from some trust and abandonment issues I picked up from some bad relationships growing up. I never felt like I could talk to anyone because the issues always seemed so dumb to me and I could never rationalize stressing someone else out over something they couldn't effect and didn't involve them. Yes I'm also the type that gets worried when ordering take-out because I don't want to inconvenience the workers.

I've gotten better about things over the years and I'm pretty open with my fiance but even with her there's things I have to keep to myself. She's actually seen me drop the happy mask I wear around the people I don't trust with my issues and said that it was a scary thing to her that she didn't like. But I have to wear it with her sometimes because my issues seem to annoy and cause problems with her. For instance, we had gotten a German Shepherd puppy and found out after about a month that our apartment didn't allow the breed since their insurance didn't cover them. Something about the ""more violent breeds"" or something stupid. I had already bonded with the dog and loved him with all of my heart so I was absolutely destroyed and still kinda am because I never got the chance to get over it naturally. I tried to talk with her about it a few weeks later, after we had chatted before slightly, but instead of offering support she snapped at me. She yelled about how it was over and done with and there was nothing that could be done so I just needed to drop it, move on,and get over it. It didn't help for me that later she kept asking about getting another dog, which everytime I reminded her that I wanted time to get over things so the dog has a fair chance with me emotionally. The dog doesn't deserve any resent that might be there for other reasons. But she kept asking over and over so now we've had a black lab for about a year and honestly I still don't feel too much of a connection to him despite me being the one to care for him.


I dunno, everything just makes me feel like my emotions aren't valid, they're stupid to share, and I'll only be punished if I offer them up verbally. So maybe the ether will enjoy this and it'll help me feel a little better to write it out.",29Sep2020,1

Does anyone feel really guilty about things for no reason? An example; I messed up an order for my mom earlier. She said ""Oh you got the wrong one!"" and I just felt it deep down in my stomach. A lump in my throat too. I felt so guilty about it to the point where I could almost cry. I feel awful about myself the rest of the day..  

I wouldn't say I'm depressed. But maybe I am? I have good days and bad days just like everyone else. But this seems a bit weird to me. Why would I take such small things to heart? And start questioning my existence over it?

As soon as she get's distracted by other things, he's back to his own priorities.  He had two great paying jobs.  Decided he just didn't want to ""work there"" anymore.  He burned through his savings making his car payments, paying his insurance, and generally blowing it on socializing.  He had 6 months of rent, car payments, and insurance in the bank.  A safety net that he was advised to have as a good cushion and smart saving.

According to the dates on his documentation, he has been planning this suicide since he left his last job.  Always positive in conversations about getting another job.  Having job search results up on his computer monitors periodically.  It all looked great.  Oh yea, I applied here, oh yea, I applied there.

The post death instructions and comments were so excited.  He didn't know where he was going but he was excited.  He was going to the other side and couldn't wait.  No.  This is not a religious reference.    The dates on entries show a long and drawn out planning period.  Like he was going on a trip.  Specific instructions for his ashes and possessions were left.

It's a weird thing to start a post with, but as soon as I started writing this, I began tearing up. This has been impacting the quality of my life and mental health recently and I really want things to get better. I'm an overthinker. I overthink every conversation, every thought that runs through my mind, every memory I make and every action I take. I'm either living far, far in the past or years in the future.

I know that there are so many good things happening in my life right now. The problem is that sometimes, I only **see** the good things, I don't **feel** them. It's a sad thought to think that I'm missing out on so much beauty that's right in front of me - in the present moment, just because of some overwhelming sense of nostalgia or regret, aspiration or fear.

Just like everyone else, there are things in my life that I can not control. Like how my 18-year old hair follicles are taking their sweet tike to get a full manly beard going, or the fact that one day, I'll have to be independent enough to handle all my documents **and not lose them** (scary right). On a more serious note, I really dislike my university in general. I've got about 3 years left of my degree (and that's not a long time at all) but before every semester begins, I start getting depressed in advance about how my experience is going to be. My perception of my experiences is tainted beforehand and I don't ever think about the good things that happen there and all the good experiences I've previously had in university.

I'll be heading back to university soon to begin a new semester. I knew that I'd have to go back - that's something I can't change, but I couldn't help but feel this looming sense of dread. I know that when I get there, I'll forget about the dread, and I'll have a pretty good time but I shouldn't be spending the weeks before resumption feeling unnecessarily worried.

I don't know if any of this is clear enough but I hope someone can relate in some way or another. I'd like to stop stressing over uncontrollable future events and start seeing the beauty in them - start enjoying them. Any and all advice would be appreciated. Thank you! &lt;3",29Sep2020,1

Life recently has been hard, I am so privileged to have a job (furloughed), a roof (living with my parents) and friends - however the last year I have realised I’ve been existing ‘idle-ly’ and it makes me unbearably sad to think about. 

I have never used the word depressed or anxious, I just know that I’m not happy - especially when I look back to this time last year and how much of a better place I was in. 

My parents and family are emotionally unavailable and we have never discussed feelings as a family. 

My friends are great, but I don’t feel comfortable talking to them about this type of thing - partly as they are guys, and also they have their own issues they are facing. 

The only person who has said they are there for me to talk if I need them is my ex-girlfriend. We broke up in May, and I asked her last week for another shot at things but she just wanted to be friends - and the reason we split was partly due to both our suffering mental state.

Early this morning I had a resident come to my office asking me to call 911, they wanted to go to the hospital because of suicidal thoughts. They had a plan and almost took action. I was, obviously stressing out at the idea of them beinf in so much distress. I called 911 and explained everything I just explained to you. I also want to preface that this resident is the sweetest and most innofensive of all the residents in all 4 residence I work at. He's really sick and isolate himself a lot. I am always professional with the residents, but I am human, I am going to be completely honest, I feel extremely motherly with this resident. I dont show it, but I do feel this way. He does look and act like a confused scared child. He knows himself very well, so when he came to me, I knew he was dead serious. So already it pains me to see him, or any resident this way.

Thing is, I dont know how it happened, but 911 operator misuderstood something and she thought he had a weapon on him. When police arrived they asked me to get out of the office and hands over their gun they asked him to slowly put his hands behing his back and turn around. The poor resident was so confused and panicked, he couldn't understand they expected him to turn so police could se his hands, he thought he was supposed to face police, not show his back. He looked at me with the most heartbreaking look I have ever seen and I could do nothing. I kept insisting that it was unnecessary, that he was innofensive, but the policers couldn't hear me, they were too focused on the task. They handcuffed him and took him out of the office to look in his pockets. Of course there was nothing. But instead of releasing him they left him in handcuffs. They talked to,us separately.

I was seriously angered and heartbroken at that point, I was holding back the tears. Explain again what happened, he took my informations, I gave papers with all the medication he has to take, and they took him to the ambulance STILL IN HANDCUFFS holding him by the arm like he was some kind of prisoner! I dont even know if they took them off at all. 

Dont these guys know what Mental Health is?! This guy was suicidal! If he ever has another suicidal episode, its very unlikely that he will ever come down to me, or anyone else, for help! More likely is that someone will find him dead in his room the next day!

As soon as the door closed I began sobbing. For a whole hour, I was crying and sobbing uncontrollably. I went into shock not long after. When my coworker came in in the morning and I told her everything she too had tears in her eyes. She told me I was really strong and that she would have cried too. Her reaction said everything, that is not how things are suppose to happen. For a while when I was crying, I was doubting this was the field I wanted to study in, if after all our efforts to help them, they get treated like criminals in their darkest moments.

Since the beginning of the pandemic (and also a bit before), my mom has been visibly struggling with low self esteem and other problems. Now, I'm scared that she's almost (or is? I just don't want to diagnose) going through a depressive episode. She's been getting very agressive against my and my dad and completely pushes us away, and I'm completely lost as to how to help her.

I don't think this is something I can handle by myself anymore. I really want to see her doing better. Therapy, or at least professional help, would really be what she needs.

The problem is that we never talk about feelings in my family, except when we're angry. I really don't know how to bring that up.

Since I already went through therapy in the past, I know I could use that as an argument to prove her that it can helps, but that's all I got.",29Sep2020,1

255,"Hi guys. 


I’ve been thinking about getting a therapist for the longest time, and now decided to look for one. But I have no idea how this works.


I’ve been looking through the Psychology Today’s list based on my provider and area I live, but there are so many of them. I don’t know where to start at all. 


My main problem I have is human relationship issues, or communication in general. I’ve realized that I lack empathy to others and not good at communicating my thoughts (I do have a language barrier issue, but I see that that is not the just the reason). I’ve also had a lot of traumas from the past that I never dealt with properly that is now influencing my relationships today.


I want to fix these, or at least improve. I want to assess my traumas from the past once and for all. But I’m stuck at Step 1, and I have no one to reach out for help, since nobody I know take therapy. 


For people who were able to find a therapist, how did you found yours? Any signs that I need to look over? What questions should I give them? 


Anything helps. Thanks in advance.",29Sep2020,1
256,"I really don’t know where to post this, but there are some questions I can’t even begin to fathom how to solve, so r/mentalhealth seemed like the most appropriate place to start. I’m fairly out of my depth.

I have a friend that I’ve known since elementary school and kept in touch with throughout the years. He embodies many virtues related to the hacker ethos - exceptionally talented, intelligent, very much his own person. He was in periods something of a prepper and could probably be described as outright weird and/or excentric in times.

We’ve lived fairly different lives and with time he became more mellow, his excentricies less pronounced and he got married and had a kid somewhere a couple of years ago. From the outside looking in it appeared that he had found his place in life.

Recently he has gotten some kind of religious ephipany where he converted to catholicism. I wouldn’t define him as particularly religious before this, but thought that there isn’t anything inherently wrong with this - faith comes and goes with most people and he migh’ve just gotten religious.

Then I hears from a mutual acquaintance that he was talking about being hunted by the devil, that he considered himself evil. Shortly after that he was remitted to some kind of medical establishment on his own volition. His wife reached out to me and everyone who knew him to inform us that he wasn’t feeling well and that he was recuperating. After a couple of weeks things started to return to normal and he returned home.

This week something appears to take a turn to the worse, where he called me from the same medical establishment. He was taken from his house without his own volition and was cared for. I didn’t enquire more about why they had taken him in again. We talked about him being evil (which I vocally disagreed with - there is nothing in his actions or demeanour that I would in any sense of the word would consider evil. He’s sometimes quite ambitious, but never in a way which would harm others), religiosity and life in general. I was’t able to discuss much more as he called during work hours and that I was quite uncertain of what I should do and what I should say in this situation.

What has happened with my friend, what should I as a friend do and what does this mean for the future?

Sorry for the wall of text, I wasn’t able to express myself succinctly.",29Sep2020,1

258,"I don't get it, why am I like this.

I've essentially become my biggest fear; the fear of abandonment.

Almost every friendship I've had in the past decade has been completely ruined by my inability to maintain a stable relationship with anyone.

I systematically push everyone away but when they catch up with my bullshit and call me out for being a shitty friend I immediately want to become best friends again, and the cycle repeats until the person gets tired of constantly having their feelings played with and leave.

One day I love someone to death and I would take a bullet for them and the next morning I completely loose any and all interest in them and I become completely indifferent to their existence.

I try my hardest to force myself to be interested in them again but no matter what I do they might aswell be dead to me, even if a week prior I couldn't go an hour without hearing from them.

I can't understand why this happens and I want this to end.

It is for this very reason that about one year ago I've completely isolated myself into my room, I stopped seeing and talking to anyone at all, I disappeared from the face of the earth. 

The only people I have seen in the past year outside of my close family are my therapist and my psychiatrist.

In this time period I fell for the trap a couple times and made friends with some people online, I got extremely attached to them and built what seemed to be a great friendship but I inevitably ended up ruining everything and hurting them, which is why from now on I'm going to forcefully end any potential friendship. I'm not able to form or maintain human relationships and I need to be locked up in a mental hospital away from society and away from people, so that I can't hurt anyone anymore.

267,"This is a long one, and I don’t really expect anyone to have answers for me.

Not so long ago I came to realise I am asexual and aromantic, and for a while I thought that encompassed all of my problems because it helped to have a label I could identify with. Now that I have had some time to think about it, I am afraid that it isn’t just romantic relationships I have a problem with.

To give an example of what I mean, when I was thirteen years old I moved across the globe away from all the friends I ever really knew. When I was with them it felt like they were everything to me, but I quickly realised that I wasn’t as emotionally dependant on them as I thought. I found I missed the fond memories I made but not the people I made them with. When I kept in contact with them it was out of guilt or sometimes boredom rather than necessity.

I have never felt comfortable telling anyone (friends or family alike) my secrets or being vulnerable in general (I hate when people see me as weak). I have never really felt close enough to anyone that I would be comfortable telling them all the things I keep to myself. I sometimes think I should start seeing a therapist  so I have someone to talk to who won’t be able to judge me in my day to day life but that means exposing to my family that I think I need help and I don’t think I can cope with that.

I feel like sh*t when I think about the fact that I might be accidentally using all of my friends just so I don’t feel alone. They are all great people and I would hate for them to feel that I don’t love them but I’m honestly not sure if I love anyone. I’m also really afraid that I’ll end up leaving them behind to go to college or something and all the things I think I feel will turn out to be fake and it will just be thirteen year old me all over again, an empty husk of a person.
