0,"I am trying to work out what is going on with my mental health and I really want some advice from maybe somebody who has had similar experiences and felt similar things. 
I guess I'll start with actual diagnoses, several years ago now I was diagnosed with severe Depression, generalised anxiety and I'm not sure what the current medical term for it is, I think it's changed, but it was something like EDNOS (Eating Disorder)

I have been down many paths of treatment for these, and they're not what this post is about necessarily. There's something going on that I've been struggling with for a couple of years now, which could be a symptom of depression or maybe something separate that I need to speak to doctor about. I've always had a bit of trouble describing it in a way that sound right when I go back over it, but here I go. 

My body doesn't feel like it's connected properly to my brain. Sometimes it feels a bit like I'm floating, sometimes I feel like I'm in a mirage. Sometimes my body is moving but I feel completely frozen and not in control of what's happening. 
The places around me start looking odd and unfamiliar even when I'm in my own home or another place I frequently spend time, even though my brain sort of knows deep down where I am it doesn't feel like I'm really there. 
I almost feel hollow or translucent some days, ghostly even? I'm not really sure. I often hear that somebody is talking nearby but as hard as I try to pull myself back into reality to make out their words, the buzzing sound of a far off voice almost puts me in more of a trance. 
If this makes little sense I'm sorry, im just trying to be as detailed as possible.
I've heard the word dissociation, and it is the closest word I can find that seems to sort of fit, but I'm almost certain I don't have DID or BPD which is all I could really find when I looked up dissociation.
I have no sign of amnesic dissociation though I do have a history of repressed memories of trauma, and I sometimes go into a state where for however long, there's not a single thing that will stick in my head longer than a second after it's happened. I'll do a series of things, or get told something, and by the end of it it's as if it never happened, in my mind. It's like my brain gets tired of trying to remember (not that I remember things that well usually) absolutely anything. 

I find that moments of high stress or confusion trigger worse symptoms, but there's other more obscure triggers like certain songs or if there's a large area in my vision that's all a particular shade/colour. Sometimes reading books for too long can do it as well.

If anyone has the time to try to help me a little that would be so highly appreciated, 2 week Quarantine isn't so good for mental health and it's been on my mind.",29Mar2020,1
1,"I’m 18 years old and I’ve struggled with anxiety, depression, and multiple eating disorders. It all began at a very young age for me because I always got comments that I was fat and it made me very self conscious. My parents divorced when I was maybe around the age 5 but I can’t remember that well and my relationship to both of them isn’t close. I went to a boarding high-school which means I was there 5 days out of the week. I had to figure out how to be dependent on myself and I rarely shared any of my mental problems with anyone. I went through anorexia when I was in fifth grade up until eight grade. When I started high-school, I joined cross country and felt that I needed to be skinny to be fast. I was already battling with depression and anxiety for 3 years when I entered high-school. My sophomore year of high-school was the worst year for me. I relapsed into an eating disorder and I hit a low. I was the most depressed I had ever been and I withdrew myself from so many people. I quit track and soccer that year and I lost all of my friends and I didn’t know who to talk to. I couldn’t handle anything anymore. I formed bulimia and then started to self harm. I was so upset because I gained back all the weight I lost. It took me a year and half to get over it. I gradually stopped self harming with the help of friends, family, and parents. I found an outlet which was art and music. My anxiety was easier to handle and I knew that the next day was going to be better if I ever felt bad. There were still days where I completely lost myself in my thoughts but I never felt it for a long time. It wasn’t as bad as it was a year ago where I felt nothing for months and tried to find ways to numb every feeling I had. As this whole situation (coronavirus and lockdown) is erupting I find myself being anxious every minute. I stopped drinking coffee and deleted social media because I knew it was making me more anxious. I’ve just been so irritable, upset, and mad lately that I can’t control it. I keep thinking about my past mistakes and the eating disorders I went through. I keep thinking about the time I hit rock bottom. It’s just a string of thoughts that don’t seem to stop. I feel so depressed again and I’ve cried more than I have in the past year all in just one week. I tried to speak to people about it but I can’t bring myself to ‘meditate’ or doing a task. I have no motivation to. I just want to talk to somebody, but I feel so psychologically drained that I just don’t want to do anything. I don’t know what to do now. That’s why I’m asking for advice or at least some form of positive to get me through this.",29Mar2020,2
2,"Hi guys, 

I've spent months trying to encapsulate my rollercoaster experience with Bipolar into a song and music video and today I've finally released [Silver Sun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPONenZw-pU). Like Bipolar it's never what you want it to be but I'm so proud to finally put this piece of art into the world and I hope at least one other person can relate or find solace in it.

Silver sun is about waking up everyday and not knowing who you are. It’s about having a fluctuating state of normalcy contingent upon two wavering identities - the manic and the depressive. It’s about coming to terms with this schism of self as opposed to disregarding it. It’s about actively fighting dissociation to be present - as symbolized by the struggle to return to my physical body throughout the video. 

Throughout my life, I’ve used music as a means to explain my problems to both myself and those around me. I hope that silver sun can communicate to viewers the disorientation and confusion that exists within the bipolar mind. The story is sci fi in nature as its supposed to be allegorical: I’m alien to my own mind. The entire time I’m trying to ground myself back in reality.",29Mar2020,2

When it gets really bad I start to hear voices saying I’m worthless or I’m being selfish for living or nobody likes or loves me. I have no friends, no freedom at all in my life, and feel like nobody likes me all of which adds to my depression. 3 years ago I tried to kill myself (overdosing) but survived I think about trying to do that again but I’m scared of what happens after u die.

9,"I confronted my friend about how frustrated/angry I am at him always ghosting me- in hindsight, he didn't do it that much, I'm overreacting- and I messaged him. At the time I was mad so I was very passive-aggressive, for me. I'll just copy and paste the convo since it's better than narrating it-

hey
why do you keep ghosting me, fr

him: I don’t do it on purpose

sure, 
do whatever

him : I just never know what to say I feel like all I talk about nowadays is [his boyfriend]

u always come to me when youre having problems so ofc you only talk about [boyfriend] 

him : I guess you’re right I don’t want us to drift apart but I am kinda only problems. And even when I’m not talking about problems I still wanna talk about [bf] 

why does it matter if we drift apart though. 
like if u go on [app we met on] there's probably an exact copy of me somewhere. I don't get that

him : No there isn’t

sure, 
do what you want. 
I'll probably keep talking and advising shit because I don't have an ounce of self respect so basically you can pretend this convo didn't happen

him : I don’t want to find someone else, [my name] deadass no one is like you

did I tell you to find someone else,
no
I just told you im replaceable and that's it

him : Okay well no you aren’t. 
You have this this kind of humor that strangely makes quite a bit of people to laugh and the ones that don’t are just fucktards on a high horse. You’re nice but a different level of nice almost nice without reason and I always felt this need to protect that, protect you. I don’t want to make a fucking paragraph for you to read but you aren't a replaceable fuckass trust me

(I found this manipulative, it made red flags pop up, idk why)

uhhuh
you don't have to suck my dick bro

him : I wasn’t tho
him : That’s gay

what you sent me wasn't dick sucking? 
sure dude
just seems a tad bit manipulative tbh

[me explaining him what I found manipulative--the praise he did]

him : Yea nevermind hate me

I don't
and wont
I'm not as mad as I may sound
I'm just frustrated with constantly being ghosted and when you *do* message me it's usually about problems
it makes me think of [a bad, bad person who hurt us both, him way way more] and I don't like that
she'd message me saying some stupid self hating shit to bait me into sucking her dick
when I'd try to open up it was the weakest fucking """"advice"""" or consolation that I've gotten in a long time
see? I'm more angry at her than you

[I waited 2-3 hours for his response]

2 hours

him : I just needed a minute to think okay I felt bad and like shit I would’ve just said shitty things over and over if I didn’t break
him : And you are not more mad at her then me. She tricked you for like 2 weeks, I told you not to talk to her I yelled at her I got mad at her for talking to you I did everything I could to tell you she was bad. She manipulated me for a lot longer than you. She made me feel insecure about myself and about our friendships which we both shared. I felt like shit and she made me feel special but only to her. I still think that you know. It’s hard to think I’m special to anyone but her. She was special to me no one else used me, I want to still because my fucked up brain is like that. You think you’re the only one hurt that’s not true. If you made because I “ghosted” you fine. I wasn’t trying to I just wasn’t talk to anyone ask chase I was ignoring him too

a minute
is that supposed to make me excuse you from ghosting tho
I like how you spent the majority of the paragraph talking about jo and yourself
I know it's selfish but I don't want to pretend that doesn't, at the very least, affect me

him : What do you want from me
An apology?
To say let’s stop talking?
To beg you to stay?

look
all I did was tell you that I don't like it when you ghost me
you said you didn't do it on purpose
and we had a whole convo
I'm telling you how I feel

him : I hear you
I don’t do it on purpose I just don’t have anything interesting to say

this convo is fucking exhausting
you make me think of people who've acted like dicks
people who only used me as an emotional tool
like
yeah lemme dump my daily shit on you just cause I don't fucking care lol

him : Because of what I’m saying? Or acting?

because of the ghosting

him : Ohhh

it makes me think you only talk to me because you're emotional or looking for counseling
I really, really don't have a problem with being there for you or anyone else

him : I do that with everyone

ghosting or emotionally using them
cause one of those would srsly make me consider never talking to you again

him : Nvm I’m tired and you’re right I can fucking replace a dumb bitch

lol okay

11,"So recently I keep going through week-long sad bitch times, I also just got out of a, I don't want to call it a depressive episode because I'm not diagnosed but I'm not sure what else to call it. It started halfway through November and ended halfway through December, a lot of my feeling from then stemmed from my family not likening gay people and anxiety over something traumatic that happened with my dad on new years in 2018 that I link to Christmas. Then a few weeks ago my mother told my dad she has a boyfriend (my parents have split up) and instead of me treating this as a normal thing because I'm happy she has someone I fell into this panic attack induced thing where at first I was scared and anxious about my dad's reaction and I was scared that he was going to send me suicide messages again like he's done twice before and I thought everything was going back to when my parents where together which wasn't great (there was no physical abuse btw it was a lot of manipulative stuff except for the new year's thing), so that made me in this kind of panic attack episode for a few days and then I saw myself in a mirror and I felt like I wanted to kill myself and I got super insecure and I had to move my mirror because u kept crying when I saw my reflection, so that happened and now I can't see myself in the mirror without feeling like an ugly piece of shit and then he sent me a message at 1:20 in the morning about him loving me which was what he done with the suicide threats (that's what he done made super basic) and it made me spiral again and then yesterday night I was weighing out the advantages of killing myself and I did want to feel like this anymore but I'm not site what to do.

13,"Hi everyone! I’m 21 and from Ireland. I’ve been diagnosed with depression, ASD (Aspergers, extremely high functioning), and GAD. Last year I went to my GP who referred me to an outpatient clinic because she suspected I had BPD.

I’ve had one over the phone appointment with my new psychiatrist who prescribed me sertraline and queitapine. He mentioned one of those were to help me sleep.

The prescription was sent to my mothers house that I’m not currently in because she works in a pharmacy and because I’m an at risk person for COVID-19. She read my prescription without my permission and she rang me to complain I was prescribed an antipsychotic. Now she’s trying to guilt me off my medication because I don’t need it by her standards. 

Truthfully I don’t know why I was prescribed an antipsychotic and am assuming it’s because it’s violent thoughts I brought up during the appointment or a combination of other reasons including calming me enough to sleep. I’ve never had hallucinations of any sort. 

My mother has guilted me off antidepressants before because I’d be an “addict” to them. I’ve never been addicted to any substance in my life. I’ve drank alcohol but never felt the need to keep drinking it. She did this until I felt too ashamed to take them. Now I don’t want to take my new medication because I don’t want to be “crazy”. I know somethings wrong with me but I feel so guilty just like she wants me to. She’s never ever believed I’ve been mentally unwell.",29Mar2020,1
14,"To start, the two of us have been dating for near 4 months now, we’re both in college. We both communicate well and never get tried being around each other, we live together on the weekends at each others parent’s house (Not anymore due to COVID). Up till now everything has been fantastic, we’ve both been able to not run into any rough patches but I think we’ve reached our first here.

She has a lot of anxiety, has meds for it and sees a therapist. I have depression and am starting to see a therapist about it. 

My family is extremely chill and we never really fight, I’ve grown up sheltered and am extremely sensitive to  anything, I cried at the age of 11 due to a golf ball flying into the fire due to my ignorance.

Her family has a lot of interior fighting, which either results in me helping her out of the “Am I a shit daughter?” mindset (The arguments they have are really bad, this happens about twice weekly) or it ends up with her venting to me and making me depressed that things like this happen and that she suffers under it. This results in me going mute for a few hours (my current coping method) and her getting annoyed that I’m no fun, and that my depression is putting a strain on our relationship. 

I also get depressed for other reasons besides this, about once weekly I have this mute phase. 

I really want to preserve this relationship, we both deeply love each other and this is the only flaw we currently have. What are some solutions and possible advice?

15,"This is something I really never noticed as it's happened slowly and gradually. Recently I noticed I'm becoming more and more dull. 

For example, I used to be very scared of simple things like height, walking alone at night etc. Normal enough, that simply faded. Okay that's pretty good actually? 

But over the last years I lost so many emotions. I'm not getting happy over anything. I'm not getting even slightly excited by my favorite sports. I used to be scared to death of some horror games, but now I don't even play horror games because they literally bore me. I used to get sad when I hear of people dying. But now, even when people close to me die I really don't feel that much. 

There was even an instance where I landed in the hospital coming pretty close to death with my family crying at the hospital bed. That was about 1 week ago. But I kind of forgot already about it.

16,"As some of us find ourselves even more estranged and alienated than usual from the World we want so much to be a healthy and happy part of, please, think on this:

First,

Speak truthfully. Think truthfully.

Be very careful what stories you tell yourself about yourself, about the people around you, about the world.

Take care what ideas you focus on and allow to live in your head, they will shape you in ways you may never understand.

Don't give in to fear.

Take a breath, look for and study the Facts.

This is a new thing for Us, something like this has not been seen in some time, and never on this scale.

It will be scary, but it is not the End.

While there may be aspects that seem practically apocalyptic, it is not an End to All Things, it is The Way Things Were, transitioning into The Way Things Are, and we all need to learn how to deal with it, and adapt to it.

It will take time, and it will cost us, but Fear cannot be allowed to take control.

&amp;#x200B;

Second,

Before this is done, there will be few if any of Us who will not lose someone We know, or know of.

Covid-19 will lay claim to many children and siblings and elders and parents and grandparents, and no matter what, will sweep many millennia's worth of combined experience out of our world and into the dust.

It already has.

Many of Us will be lost, and however much those who remain are effected by it, it will be nothing when compared to the experiences that wait in lonely homes and over-crowded hospital rooms for those of Us who are never able to recover from it.

Adjust to that idea, because it is here, and it will not just go away if you hide from it.

Better to be prepared.

Think very carefully about what you say regarding those of Us that are especially subject to this thing.

Ageism is synonymous with Sexism and Racism for a reason.

People are people, some act well, some act poorly.

Most of Us do quite a bit of both.

This thing will take the good and evil alike, and the world is better served when people are not singled out with disrespect and degradation.

Surely you've experienced enough to recognize what the short end of the stick feels like?

Be mature enough to recognize that dealing that pain out to another, even indirectly, is vile, and of little worth or use, if any.

&amp;#x200B;

Third,

For all of Us, but especially for those of Us trapped first and foremost in our minds, with our various demons and histories, and now truly trapped in our own homes:

Please, the Internet is here and standing strong, reach out.

Reach out to strangers, reach out to the people you love, reach out to the people who love you, reach out to people you haven't spoken to in years but have many unspoken words to share with (kind or begrudging).

Social Media has strung an intricate web of connections across the world, use them.

If ever there was a time when you were not alone in your experience of the world around you, it is Now.

Google is the single most powerful search engine ever designed, ask it the questions that linger in your heart and mind, and threaten to drive you mad.

Educate yourself, now that you have so much time to spend.

Take care of yourself.

Find the things that dependably keep you well, that keep you going, and tend to them.

Be productive, feed your creativity, nourish your health, tidy any aspect of your home and life that you can.

There is never nothing to be done, there are simply things you would rather not do.

Look deeply into the dark corners of your world you habitually try to ignore or forget.

Pick up and organize your living space, clean up your trash, take care of the thing in the place you try not to look at because it has always been there, and you just don't want to deal with it.

Its your Life, it is You.

Take care of yourself,

Please.

No one else will ever be able to care for you like you can learn to care for yourself, and learning how to do so will only ever make you stronger than you ever imagined you could be.

As always before, and ever after, WE NEED THE STRONG ONES.

We need all of Us, and this world will take enough on its own, We cannot spare a single person who may otherwise find themselves left behind.

&amp;#x200B;

Do not dwell over-long on the things that are far beyond your power to change.

Focus on what lies closer to heart and home, and is in many ways far scarier.

If we all take care of our little pieces of the world as much as we can, surely the world will become better for our little efforts?

You, little drop in the ocean, always remember this:

What is an ocean, but a multitude of drops?

This world is larger and more complicated than you alone can possibly grasp or comprehend,

But it is composed of all of Us, of We.

There is so much Good within your reach, if only you find the strength to seek it out, to take responsibility for its growth.

This will not be easy.

Its not meant to be.

Be kind, be understanding, be generous, be truthful, be humble.

Take responsibility for as much as you can truly bear, and do whatever you can to help, even if that means staying inside, out of the way of this thing as it sweeps across the Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

We Need You, and We Can Get Through This,

Together.",29Mar2020,1
17,"This is going to be a longer, heavy post. And yes this is a new account. I want somewhere to post which is anonymous, and I think you’ll realise why.

I’ve never been diagnosed with anything, so I’ve got no therapist or psychiatrist, and waiting times in the UK, where I’m from and live, are months at a time. This is without a pandemic. So seeing someone isn’t an option right now. That and my parents (I’m still living at home, 17 y/o) haven’t taken well to things like this before.

My current situation is this. I’m worthless. I’m stuck in toxic ‘friendships’ I can’t get out of, and my past actions (I was a horrible little shit when i was 10-14) ruined my chances of a social life with those in my hometown. I’m left out if things on a regular basis and I feel like dead weight. The only people who care about me are considered weird(they watch anime I guess), and I’m paranoid what the toxic ones will say about me when I’m with them. Looking back on secondary school I realise I was bullied, and i don’t want to see 95% of them again. Someone had a few of the people who bullied me on FaceTime in college the other week and I nearly cried in front of everyone. And everyone thinks I’m ok with the toxic ones and I’ve got to act it and I hate it. There’s one guy who’s alright.

Very few things bring me joy anymore. I play a sport, but that’s sporadic and it’s like escapism at this point. That’s on hold indefinitely right now. Apart from that I do college work or play video games I don’t care about anymore. No social gatherings as I’ve already said. Also all the things I’m truly good at and enjoy contribute nothing to society, so I’m just a poor excuse of a student compared to people offering actual skills.

The way I look mëäns I’ve got no self esteem. I can’t stand myself. I can’t see myself in the mirror or the shower (I’ve got a quite severe sight condition) which is a blessing, cause anytime I do I want to peel my skin off. It’s awful. I’m just a collection of physical mistakes rolled into a body that doesn’t fit. I feel wrong and there are things that should and shouldn’t be there. I want to talk to someone about dysphoria or dysmorphia, and a lot of the time I feel like I’d be better if I were the opposite sex (I’m assigned make at birth if that helps). But I can’t say that to my parents because they reacted badly to me potentially being bi a few years back. This is me saying to a friend I wanted to think about and explore it. So I’m trapped and I hate myself. I’m never going to get anyone to love me because of all of this, and I just feel empty and alone a lot of the time. Everyone is growing up and progressing, and any chance I get to make a proper connection with anyone I always fuck it up.

As I’ve said, I feel quite empty, sometimes I just wake up sad for no apparent reason, random waves of just crushing sadness are a thing, and when it was really bad I looked at suicide as an option. I didn’t because I always imagined my grandma at my funeral, but she died of a stroke at Christmas. I can’t do it now, cause it’ll finish off my mum (both her parents dead inside two years), but telling her ‘hey I want to see someone about maybe being trans’ might have a similar effect. I don’t know what to do, I feel trapped, and the only people who sort of know what I’m struggling with can do nothing. So I sit here, just mired in the shit mostly of my own making, with no one to blame but myself. I’m pathetic.

24,"I’m just alone, the quarantine is like normal every day life for me.

It bums me out because this is still continuation of regular life for me.

22 year old male.  Grew up normal, well educated, athlete/jock, everything on paper was good.

I have self conscious issues about how I look, my masculinity, randomly things I do i think about over and over again.

I cannot maintain relationships of any sort

I dealt with substance abuse and I deal with that stigma of being a drug addict.  I was only using (Xanax, cocaine, alcohol, all to the point of a deviated septum, stomach disease, I had yellowing in my eyes....) all just to silence my thoughts.  

I was sent to boarding schools growing up between 14-18 as my parents didn’t want any part of me I didn’t think, they were going through a divorcée and I don’t think they could handle me.  It’s called the trouble teen industry, there’s a subreddit on it.  

My best friend died 2 years ago.  I cannot relay what we went through and how much he meant to me.  

All my other friends used me growing up, they would skip ahead of me at events to not be seen entering with me, steal, text my old girlfriends (when I was able to maintain).  

My brothers are complete assholes and they themselves have substance abuse problems and are both so successful.  I’m just a line cook and it sucks.

My dad moves around all the time. He keeps going through girlfriends and I haven’t seen him for more than a few days in years.  My moms a drunk whose bipolar and has a crazy mind.  

When I see things about addiction, about heroine, I break down.  I read the subreddit for troubled teen industry sometimes in some sort of sickening self destructive thing I do to myself and cry.

Like I said I replay things over and over in my mind and I think that’s what’s always affected me most.  Just like things people say that hurt me, dumb things I said to embarrass myself, someone looking at me wrong.  I sit there and self loathe about it.  6 months ago I would’ve drank over it but I wasn’t even spared with a decent stomach to hold it down.

I have depression; diagnosed bipolar; and I suffer from a decent amount of anxiety attacks.

I am so fucking alone.  Idk just a vent I guess cuz I don’t even want to post it now but I guess I will if there’s any suggestions.  

I know I have issues, I know what I need to do to get better.  I don’t know why it’s so fucking hard though.",29Mar2020,1

28,"Hello. I(13) have been struggling with issues with hallucinations and delusions for around 9 months or so, and I'm wondering if this is just a part of depression. I have gotten diagnosed with severe depression, severe anxiety, and severe social anxiety. I stopped going to the therapist before I could get on medication.   
What I want to ask is, is my hallucinations and delusions normal for severe depression, or should I go to the doctors? I will go into detail about what I am experiencing.   
So it starts out with sometimes a normal day, but a bit drained. Once it gets a bit later in the day I start feeling like I'm not on this earth, like I'm floating. I can barely pay attention to things because stuff starts distracting me out of the corner of my eye. I start to feel like I'm going to pass out, until I suddenly feel very awake. This is where the bad things happen. I start seeing all kinds of things, and hearing/feeling too. Along with believing outrageous things. This might just go on for a hour, but it once lasted for 2 months.  
I'm now going to  show examples of what has happened before. I convinced myself for 2 months the government was going to kill my family. I would hear the people break in, see shadows, smell them, and once felt them hit me. I also believed our water was poisoned and didn't drink water for 2 days.  
Another thing that happened was I believed the sky was evil and cursing the earth. It turned my neighbors house into ants, which i then felt and saw come through my walls and crawl on me.  
Is this normal for a person my age with depression? Thank you in advance!",29Mar2020,1
29,"Wow. This is a new low even for me. I grew up with severe abandonment issues (father left, step father didn’t want to know me, mother hid me, raised by negligent grandmother for a few years, immigrant, sexual abuse as a child, etc). So i have always been obsessed with getting approval. I am desperate for any attention I can get and simultaneously I refuse to accept praise because I don’t deserve it. So it’s a never ending pit. I’ve always wanted to save the world. I wanted to particularly help kids and women. So I thought becoming a lawyer will make me a saviour. I became a family law lawyer. I wanted to help families. So turns out all I do is get shat on by stressed out people and all i do is get paid to be a cog in a machine. 

Anyway, I’m miserable at the best of days but learned to live with it. I am envious and compare myself to others daily. My privileged life is not good enough my eating disorder is rampant. As I donate money to Yemen I throw up food in the bathroom. 

Ok, the last straw is my severe jealousy and envy of health care workers that are praised for saving lives. Every night I yell for the healthcare workers along with everyone out of the window  and teach my son what we are cheering for.  My life was saved from childhood pneumonia I have utmost respect for nurses doctors and sanitary staff. And yet. My mental problems are rearing their ugly head. Why am I invisible and all I get is yelled at. Where is my praise.

This coronavirus stuff has completely thrown me off balance. I’m crying all the time, I have panic attacks, I can’t sleep anymore. I’m terrified of getting sick to where I can’t take care of my patients- I’m terrified of someone I love getting sick and being unable to seek treatment or dying. I’m in a constant state of stress and there’s *nothing* that I can do to change the state of the world right now. 

I have to go to work still. My husband still has to go to work. We are daily exposing ourselves to people who could carry this illness. If I don’t go to work, there is no cover. I am the ONLY pharmacist for a prison with 4000 inmates. There is no second pharmacist, nobody to hold the fort if I take a week off to sort out my mental health. So I’m pushing through. I’m constantly washing my hands to the point that they’re bleeding. I’m sanitizing everything. I’m trying to stay six feet from everyone (which is difficult when the pharmacy is only 10x15 feet). 

I feel selfish for being so scared. For complaining when there are thousands of pharmacists who are in worse places than I am. Pharmacies aren’t protecting their employees at all. They’re the only healthcare professionals facing this pandemic without the protection of a face mask or even gloves. I’m privileged to only have close contact with only 5-6 people daily. But I’m still scared.

I’ve been working from home for the past few weeks, and I’ve only left the house to go to my weekly therapy appointments. At this point in time, my therapist is offering a video chat option but she will also be in her office which I would rather do. 
I’m currently in therapy for reasons other than the coronavirus, and covid is not causing me too much worry- I am not an at risk population or leaving my house to see anyone. However, I obviously wouldn’t want to be catching it or have a hand in spreading it to others in my home. There is extremely limited social contact when I do go- the only human I see there is my therapist and it’s not like we have physical contact. There’s probably a good 5 feet between us, but I’m sitting on a couch that other people have sat on and talking to someone who’s probably seen many other patients that day. 
At the moment, I’m not really sure what to do. I’d much rather go to this appointment in person because it is easier for me to communicate that way and I think communicating online would be a disservice to my mental health. Additionally, the state has not mandated the office to close down, which makes me think that it may be safe.

It became my biggest focus to always try to be doing SOMETHING so that my mind doesnt wander into a bad place. since the covid-19 thing has been going on. ive been forced to stay home...and do nothing. 2 days felt like a week. im having terrible hallucinations (visual, auditory and tactical). im so paranoid and i feel so lonely. my only friend is my boyfriend , i told him i dont feel well lately but i dont want him to worry so i spared the details. everytime someone speaks to me with bit of a aggression i completely break down.  ive been having hysterical crying fits, the kind where you cry until you cant breathe and you vomit. i genuinely dont feel like a human being anymore. my emotions dont feel real nothing feels real and the fact that i don’t know why i feel like this all of a sudden is racking my brain. its been bad for about a month but since ive been quarantined from covid-19, it gets worse everyday. terrible nightmares and intrusive thoughts so horrible i cant even comprehend how my brain even comes up with those types of things. i cant think straight, i find myself doing the same thing over and over because it feels safe. im scared to tell anyone whats going on but honestly i dont even know. i feel so anxious and nervous and like if i say something no one will like me. ive been seeing signs alot of various things, trying to connect life to a higher meaning. i feel like i can see into the souls of people near me and i can read their thoughts and they all hate me. i dont know what to do. im scared for myself because i didnt grow yp with much and i was always praised for my mind. if i loose my mind i will literally have nothing. and that is my biggest fear",29Mar2020,1

i was diagnosed with ADHD and Anxiety when i was in 4th grade. I have spent YEARS taking different types of medications with different types of side effects. It resulted with me avoiding drinking water as i got older because not only was it always associated with my medications but when i drank water i always got this taste in the back of my mouth that made me gag. the only thing i could compare it to was the taste of a pill going down and it was nauseating. I knew every soda machine in high-school down to what price they where each set at and which ones had which drinks. As iv gotten older iv realized that not only is that not healthy but water really is essential to life and specialty now with a pandemic. It may just be me who struggles with this but on the off chance its not, here is my solution.

I started buying crystal light to mix into my water and i always have it ice cold.  it dose not have a whole bunch of sugar and it dose not have a bunch of artificial flavors either. i have been personally using the pink lemonade and raspberry lemonade as well.

42,"I’m 15 and so is the girl I’m in love with. She struggles with romantic emotions because of what happened to her. I know she loves me but because of that trauma she is scared that someone will hurt her again.
I’ll be deleting this post by tomorrow. Ever since she was 3 years-old, on every summer she would go to her grandparents house to spend some vacation and every since that age her grandfather would come up to her and sexually assault her, he would touch her on her private parts daily and only later on she realized what was happening, this happened everytime for 10 years. She would tell some people what happened but they wouldn’t believe her. That bastard would take pictures of her naked and masturbate in hall while looking at her. When she was 13, she had the courage to tell her grandmother, she was lucky that that bastard’s computer was on and so she showed the pictures of her self naked there. 
When everyone found out, he was said to have mental issues so he wasn’t going to jail. Her father would only talk to him on holidays because they are still father and son, but then that bastard had the audacity to say that it wasn’t his fault because SHE ASKED FOR IT. After that her father never again talked to him. 
She went to some psychiatrists but gave up and she told me she didn’t want other people to know. Her father has an high IQ and is an accomplished doctor and she deeply respects him, but he says that it’s a waste of time going to the psychiatrist.
She is still tormented by what happened to her and everytime she thinks about it, she questions if it was all her fault. She can’t think of anything sexual that it’ll bring her that bad memory.
We both love each other and we aren’t dating because of that, she can’t get too much close to boys because, although it has gradually getting better, she’s scared of men and they can do to her.
She doesn’t want to go to a psychiatrist and everytime I try to help her she cries and I feel awful for her.

It is a little complicated about therapy and counseling and I do not know all of the details because I no longer live at home. Anyway my sister has had issues for a few years with anxiety and panic attacks. Since I have left home a few other issues have come up. She is constantly asking my mom if she can or should do things like, should I wake up now, should I eat this, should I wear this. Sounds like no big deal and small right, she is 13 so I thought all of these questions were kind of a weird things to ask at the age especially because it was a day with no plans. She is also having major stress about small mistakes. On a homework problem she accidentally wrote 9 instead of an 8 and started freaking out. The incident went on for a while where she kept saying she didn't mean to put that. She is very repetitive and needs control. My mom thinks she is having trouble with her being in control as a parent figure and gets upset easy at things or tries to take control of things she shouldn't at 13. Which is another reason of why it's confusing she is constantly asking what she should do but wants control. She also apparently is having some paranoia or fear with people or things. She was always scared easily about things but it's different now. One example was a random man walked past them and she kept getting nervous about how weird and strange he seemed and talked about it for awhile. Another is she saw a waitress with a tie dye shirt and kept exclaiming how weird it was and it made her uncomfortable and scared etc. She also doesn't seem to have good confidence about herself or her looks and thinks she is fat but literally she's a twig. There are a lot of other issues and I'm sure these sound small but it's hard to explain them.

56,"Over the years I've gone through waves of whatever this is.

 When I was younger, I would wash my hands before and after doing anything as well as change my clothes 3+ times a day. I would think I had some sort of minor OCD issue, though I believe I've grown out of that for the most part. That's just to provide a bit of context

Now I like to think I've gotten more 'normal', or maybe just better at masking things. But I absolutely hate the texture of most things. Like how some people hate nails on a chalkboard, or something alone those lines. 

Here's a small list of things I cant think of off the top of my head:

•Cotton
•Cardboard
•Chalk
•When my hands get wet
•Towels
•Velvet 
•The pads of my fingers almost always (I constantly scratch at them as if theres something on them even though realistically I know there isnt. I do this pretty much constantly all day every day)
•Any sort of powder (flour, makeup, ect)
•Wool
•Sand
•Dirt (Its okay when planting things, but when not controlled I hate having it on me and feel like It'll never come off)
•wood
•memory foam (without a sheet or something on it id that makes any sense)
•Tissues (I absolutely despise them)
•Expo markers and whiteboards (especially when tissues are used as erasers)
•dried clay (think pots for planting)
•styrofoam 
•Paper bowls (paper plates are fine so idk how that makes any sense)
•erasers (pencil)
•lotion
•sponges

Im sure theres many other things that I just cant think of  on the spot. But it's to the point where it's very annoying in my every day life. Certain things bother me more than others depending on the day. But I haven't met anyone else that seems to have this issue and they think Im strange for hating everything. 

I often find myself needing to retouch things over and over until it 'feels' right (note back to when I mentionedhaving to scratch the pads of my fingers as an example), which is often a sign of OCD from what I've seen. But I don't believe that I have it because I dont find myself changing the way I walk or eat or do other daily tasks because of this. My overall way of life hasn't changed. And I most certainly dont want to self diagnose. 

But it had gotten to the point where I am super annoyed by it and would like to not get goosebumps every time I think about touching things. 

For example, the gloves I had to wear at work today had some sort of powder on them to make it easy t get them off? Anyway, Im in bed now, hours after my shift ended, still picking at my fingers because I can still feel the texture of the powder on my hands despite it not being there because I've washed my hands and showered since. 

Ive seen people that hate specific textures, like my dad hates cardboard, and many people hate cotton. But I have that same reaction to so many things that it seems a bit over the top. 

Even if you cant tell me exactly what you think this this, feel free to leave any tips you have on possibly helping with it.

57,"It started as slight anxiety for around 2 years. Then this year it all fuckin changed. My anxiety disorder turned into a full on panic disorder. I can hardly talk to my paretns without getting a fuckin frog in my throat. I shake when I talk to my school teachers, I puke at least once a day from the fuckin gut wrenching anxiety. Every moment I feel like I’m crawling out of my own skin, in every situation I just wanna run. My thoughts are becoming irrational. I find myself thinking random thoughts almost delirious thoughts. I can’t go much longer like this, I want my own life back. I want my depression back and my anxiety disorder. I want to go back to where everyday doesn’t feel like mental torture. Like I said I can’t even fuckin talk to my paretns without having a panic attack. It’s awful, I don’t want to die I’m not suicidal. But I need advice I need to stop this panic, I want to be normal. God I just want to go back.",29Mar2020,1

He knows about my mental health issues and always helped me in every way he can. But I'm starting to wonder if I'm actually making him worst. I honestly believe I'm a monster sometimes. And I'm starting to believe that I'm ruining my boyfriend. I love him very much and never did anything to hurt him. But I'm starting to think that maybe I'm just a big unsolvable problem.

59,"As of March 28, 2020, new coronavirus cases have passed 663,000. 

While this is a global virus, some countries have been hit harder than others. The United States currently has the most confirmed cases, while Spain and Italy have seen the most deaths, with 5,982 and 10,023. 

Not only are individuals in communities the world over becoming sick and in some cases dying, but economies are shutting down and livelihoods are being upended as governments struggle to slow the spread.

People are being told to stay home, isolate themselves, practice social distancing and only leave the house for essential reasons. Many schools and universities have moved their courses online, with varying degrees of success, and many workers have been laid off. 

In the United States, jobless claims reached an all-time high of 3.3 million earlier this week. 

According to a report released by Cigna, an American health insurance company, 3 out of 5 Americans were already suffering from feelings of loneliness before the spread of the coronavirus.

Bert Uchino, a professor at the University of Utah who studies health and relationships, says that these feelings have “widespread effects” on an individual’s overall well-being, leaving them more likely to feel anxious and depressed.
Intersection of heath and economics 

With new measures in place to curb physical interaction, mental health experts are expecting to see an uptick in stress and anxiety in the general population.

One of the main reasons for this, according to Dr. Mary Alvord, is that this type of event is especially conducive to “catastrophizing,” meaning affected individuals can get trapped into fixating on the virus and the possible ways it can hurt them or their loved ones. 

Loneliness and lack of social contact may exacerbate these problems. 

“This mass anxiety spiral limits what you do,” Alvord says. 

Dr. Andrew Kuller, a clinical psychologist at Boston’s Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital, echoes this sentiment. Those with anxiety problems may have “trouble doing anything but washing [their] hands every minute they’re awake,” Kuller says, setting aside other things that are necessary to function normally in their daily lives.

Although these examples skew towards the more extreme, others point out that both economic and health anxieties are being pushed to the forefront of people’s minds, creating conditions for a troubling social response. 

“The worry becomes, ‘How do I pay my bills? What if I lose my job? What if I lose my car?” says Patrick McGrath, the head of clinical services at NOCD, an online mental health site that connects licensed practitioners with patients. “Anxiety disorders are based on two words: ‘What if,’ followed by the worst scenario your brain can devise.”
Constant coverage

Another factor likely to lead to an increase in mental health issues in the current moment is the sheer amount of news coverage that people are ingesting along with the daily reminder of new cases and higher overall death tolls. 

Laurel Purves, a resident of Wisconsin, spoke with The Millennial Source about the efforts he’s taking to try to maintain a healthy perspective. 

“I deactivated most of my social media and deleted all the news apps from my phone. I give myself 10 minutes a day to catch up on the news,” Purves says. “Part of the problem is that coronavirus is the only thing anyone is talking about and it’s overwhelming.”

Stefanie, a resident of Ontario, Canada, concurs. 

“In terms of mental state, it’s not so much the social distancing that is bothering me but just the state of the world right now. It is a scary time,” Stefanie says.

For years, many social scientists have lamented the media’s tendency to focus on negative stories at the expense of more positive overall trends, which often have the effect of making events around the world seem worse than they sometimes are. 

“Human flourishing has been enhanced in measure after measure,“ argues Steven Pinker, a cognitive psychologist at Harvard. [But] “if you ask people if we are living in an increasingly dangerous or increasingly safe environment, they will think of the latest terrorist attack and conclude that life has been getting more dangerous — rather than going to FBI data on violent crime, which in fact has shown a decline over 25 years.”

Others caution that human beings may have an innate bias to prioritize negative stories as they are seen as an outlier to what is perceived as normal or right. 

According to a 2019 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a scientific journal, this “negativity bias” is likely the reason why news outlets prioritize stories deemed negative. 

“Our suspicion was that the way news looked wasn’t purely a function of what journalists felt but more about what audiences responded to,” says Stuart Soroka, the paper’s lead author. 
The power of the mind

With COVID-19, governments and mental health institutions have offered advice on how to cope in isolation. These recommendations range from staying connected to loved ones through social apps, sticking to a routine, taking notice of things that make you feel positive and not absorbing so much news that you find your mood is significantly altered in a negative way.

Jelena Kecmanovic, Adjunct Professor of Psychology at Georgetown University, emphasizes the need to steer clear of focusing on things you can’t control.

“We really cannot directly control our feelings and thoughts … what we can control is how we react,” she says.

Still, as economic and social pressures continue to mount, many are bound to struggle with dark feelings like anxiety and depression. 

Adam from Portland, Oregon, told The Millennial Source that he can’t help but worry that things will get worse. 

“My regular anxiety was already past my coping skills,” he says. “None of my older relatives are taking this thing seriously. I’m terrified that I’m going to bury my parents and be homeless by the end of the year.”

Due to the Coronavirus I can not go to the ER for this. I’m currently living with my parents (I’m 18) and they wouldn’t understand that I’m not choosing to have suicidal thoughts they are just there. My parents think suicidal thoughts are made up and selfish. 

I feel like next time I am in the reach of something potentially harmful (like a kitchen knife) I won’t be able to restrain myself.

Not only for my marriage but also myself, in the amount of time I've been working on myself I've been failing at every turn losing my job my apartment and my car the only thing I have left is my wife and dog. My question is as the title states should I seek therapy? I've been trying everything from writing my inner thoughts down to meditation. I feel hopeless and I feel like I'm not at my full potential and lazy. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you in advance.",29Mar2020,1
62,"Hey everyone I just really need to vent right now. Everyone I’ve talked too thinks I’m overreacting but I don’t know who to talk to about this/ or how I should feel. 

For the past couple of years I have been thinking of adopting a shelter pup. I have severe depression /anxiety and thought it would be helpful to have an emotional support animal however at the time I felt like I wouldn’t even be able to take care of a pet. 

These last couple of months I was really considering it so I called up a cousin of mine who works at a dog groomer and has 5 dogs herself just to talk about the responsibility and different types of breeds for first time dog owners (I’ve always had cats growing up). 

My roommate also has a dog and has been pressuring me to get one too so they could play together and keep each other company especially now since we both work from home due to the corona virus. 

Anyways, that same day I called my cousin and she told me about another family member who was looking to rehome her dog since she was moving to a new home that didn’t allow pets. 

Long story short out of pure impulsiveness I called up that family member and she let me take the dog (Penny) home that same day. I was so happy and excited that I took her to my cousins groomers and got her all washed and groomed and bought her everything she could ever need. 

I think Penny was excited to get out of her previous home because I know my family member didn’t take the best care of her. She is almost 2 and not trained at all. All in all, Penny got accustomed to my home and my roommates very easily and quickly. She got along with my roomies dog and they played together within the same day. 

However, that night I felt a pit in my stomach. I began to question myself and my mind kept on telling me that I was selfish for getting her because I knew deep down that I couldn’t take care of her consistently due to my mental health. I was sobbing that night thinking about it and how I am going to be a shitty dog owner and ruin Penny’s life. The next day I ended up telling my roommates about it and at first they were up for taking the lead on training her and taking care of her but realized that with their busy schedules they couldn’t either. 

Two days into having Penny we decided we needed to find a new home for her. All while looking for a new family for Penny, she got so attached to me and I got attached to her too. She was always following me around and slept at right next to me every night for the two weeks we had her. My roommate had a family friend and her husband that had recently lost their dog and have been looking for a new one. We sent them photos of Penny and they instantly fell in love. 

They asked if we could bring her over the following week. That last week with Penny was so nice and i kept trying to convince myself to keep her but I knew that I wouldn’t be a consistent enough person to train her and give her the best life. My roommates and I live in a fairly small apartment and the new family own a large house on a big plot of land for Penny to roam so the quality of life would be ten times better especially since they are both retired and literally have nothing else to do but love on her. 

I knew that after this pandemic slows down I would have to go back to my regular schedule working up to 50 hours a week. 

Today was the day we drove Penny to her new home. I was crying the entire way there as she laid on my lap. We got to the house and her new owners were nothing but sweet and kind and their home is like a dogs paradise. I was holding back tears as we spoke to them about Penny (6 feet apart of course lol).

As I left the house, Penny ran up to the gate probably confused as to why she wasn’t coming with me and I started balling. The entire drive hone I couldn’t stop sobbing. 

I feel so shitty because what if I could take care of her and I was just being scared!? What if Penny got attached to me and now she has separation anxiety and depression. I feel like I’m ruining that dogs life and all day I’ve been having panic attacks constantly thinking of the worst care scenario. 

Am I overreacting? If anything, I feel like I just caused myself stress for being impulsive and stupid for thinking I could take care of animal when I can barely care for myself. I don’t know what to do. I so badly want to call them and ask for her back but I know that I can’t do that. I miss her so much and I know it’s only been two weeks and I probably sound idiotic. I’ve never been attached to a dog. I know this post probably is the longest most pointless thing but I feel horrible and my heart is racing and I just want her back.",29Mar2020,1
63,"So I've been feeling awful for a good month, and I was SO relieved when I got to stay home from school because of closures (of course I don't wish harm on anyone, but school had been particularly stressful) so I was lazing around, watching Mad Men on netflix, (a show set in the sixties) and one moment in one episode just hit me in the face. 

Basically, a character's psychiatrist is stumped about what's wrong with said character, because she seems to be exhausted by her own household and basic duties. Suddenly I realized, that's what had been happening to me. I've been finding it harder and harder to shower because I just don't have the energy (even though intellectually, I know it'll make me feel better) I haven't done laundry in months I've been wearing the same dirty clothes for a week, and I haven't texted or talked to anyone outside of my household. I go to sleep at 3-4 am ish after hours of bingeing youtube and netflix, and then sleep well into the afternoon. And I can barely pull together 1 real meal a day.

64,"I've noticed for a couple months now that my mood shifts a lot. It didn't used to in the past, but now it is. I'll be super gloomy and ""distant"" one morning, be all laughs and smiles during the day, and then feel like crying myself to sleep at night (but I can never actually cry). Just last night, my eyes kept burning as though I was going to cry, but it never came out. Or sometimes I'll have a really good and productive day, but the next day I don't want to see anybody or do anything and I'll just lie there.


Recently, I've also been dealing with what I believe is anxiety, according to my friends. One day, throughout the day, I kept getting these nerves. Like when you're about to give a presentation. But I was just sitting at home as I always do. I kept thinking something was off, and my mind was just going wherever it wanted. The next day, I could barely smile. I drove to work and didn't even remember the drive, as I just dissociated. Everyone at work noticed I was different. It happened again a couple days ago. So my family believes this is my anxiety manifesting (I'm 20, and it runs in my family), but it feels like something... more. Something worse.

But I have no idea where to go or what to do. I know I need help, but the only doctor I've been to in the last 10 years is an urgent care when I was sick. I know nothing of doctors and clinics. 

Where do I go? Who do I talk to?

It might sound stupid, but I want a diagnosis if there is one. I want to know exactly what it is so that I can do what I need to do to deal with it.",29Mar2020,1

We are living in what it seems a new world. It's crazy how things changed overnight and what we call a normal life is now just like a distant memory.

And I was looking at my gums and all the sores and swelling and what looks like blisters almost? and I think there's been some receding in places and I feel so hopeless and broken. And I looked up my dentist who I can't even go to right now cause I'm coughing and my chest hurts, and it honestly doesn't even matter. Even if I went I couldn't afford any treatment and even if I could afford treatment it wouldn't matter cause my shitty habits aren't gonna change. They haven't for the past 10 years, back when I was in middle school and only brushed my teeth once a month, and I thought I would be dead before I had to face the consequences but I'm still here. And that's how it seems everything in my life is going. I feel like my ED is starting to relapse and I want to self-harm again and I want to cry and I wish I had never been born. I feel so hopeless and directionless, nothing makes me happy or gives me passion anymore and i feel like seeing a therapist wouldn't help because I don't want to have to work to fix it, I want to either be dead or have it magically go away.

67,"Hi Reddit! This is going to be a fairly long post but I feel that it is urgent so I will get right to it…

I just got off of an hour long phone call with one of my closest friends that I met during the early stages of college. My first two years of college were spent in a town other than my hometown where I got the opportunity to become close with a very diverse group of friends. Over the years, we have gone in different directions but our paths have continued to overlap and we have been fortunate enough to keep the “family” close throughout despite being in and out of different cities over the years. Before I came into the picture, my closest friend of the group (we’ll call her Liz) was already close with another good friend in the group (we’ll call her Jenna). Liz and Jenna got along very well because they both came from small towns in Texas and both came from families that were heavily affected by abuse, drugs, alcoholism, addiction, and even the foster care system. Fortunately, both ladies were strong, intelligent, and mentally stable and made their ways out of some pretty bad situations. Liz is the one that I just spent an extended amount of time on the phone with and the “family” member that I have always felt closest to. Liz and Jenna still work together, Liz being Jenna’s boss, and when the current pandemic began Liz was trying to determine who would, unfortunately, be laid off or furloughed until such a time that business could resume.

To provide a little bit more background, this is a small business with a tight-knit group of line staff who frequently hung out together outside of work drinking and smoking weed. They all knew each other quite well and were comfortable enough with each other that they all knew that if anyone needed *anything* they could always reach out to each other and even sleep on each other's couches if necessary. Everyone was also aware that Jenna was going through a tough time with her family (her sister who had been living with her especially) and was going through a period of depression for the last five months or so.

So, a week or so ago, Liz was calling all of the employees that she intended to keep and fielding them to ensure that if they were kept they would be able to be flexible with their schedule and hours. Jenna knew that this was a serious conversation and something to be taken seriously, but was obviously not aware of the reason that Liz was asking these questions. Jenna assured Liz that she would be able to work whatever hours were given to her. Jenna being on the schedule still would have put her in a very good place as she was already squared away with her apartment complex so that she would not have even needed to pay rent until at least June.

Out of almost nowhere, Jenna called Liz back and mentioned that she had made the decision to move back home to the town she had grown up in and where her family still lived. She let her know that she wanted to be clear that she would not be needing any hours at work and that she wanted to “be safe” and go ahead and move back near her family where she didn’t have to worry about paying rent or anything. This was an abrupt move to a town three hours away *in one night*. Jenna packed several bags to bring with her to her new home but left her apartment still full of her belongings. When Liz inquired as to where she would be living and why she had decided to move away from a job she knew she had, a home she knew she had for at least a few more months, and why she had not bothered to take her stuff with her, none of the answers added up. Jenna mentioned that she would be living with a friend of her brother’s friend and that she was currently living in his living room but that he had a shed in his backyard that they would add drywall too and run an extension cord to for a small window unit air conditioner. Other than that, no running water, kitchen space, or bathroom would be available to her in this shed. None of this made sense as the apartment that she was living in already had all of these things and more and would accommodate her for at least two more months even if she lost her job amid the pandemic.

Liz repeatedly told Jenna that she had a home in her spare bedroom if necessary and would not need to pay rent and that if she needed money or assistance that she would be more than happy to help find solutions. Jenna assured Liz that she knew this. Another concerning factor was that one of the things Liz and Jenna had both told each other for the more than nine years that they had known each other was that they would never, under any circumstances, move back in or near their families. They are both level-headed, intelligent women who knew that being around those kinds of toxic situations would be detrimental to their mental health. When none of the reasons that Jenna gabe Liz made any remote sense, her first thought was that maybe she was using harder drugs. Jenna primarily smoked weed and did not have any drug dependencies to speak of, to say that she might be abusing any prescription drugs or even other hard drugs such as meth or heroin would not be *that* far fetched. Jenna had grown up around these kinds of things and had experimented with some prescription drugs, shrooms, etc. from time to time, but never had a real interest in them and recognized the dangers of them.

Of course the idea that Jenna had moved back to her hometown to use drugs more was concerning, but the real concern came when other employees were drilling Liz about what had happened to Jenna and why she hadn’t been seen or heard from. At this point, I should also mention that Jenna had still continued to call Liz on a daily basis (twice daily from what I understand) just to talk. She would give reasons like “I just feel better having you on the phone,” etc. Liz and myself, both being clinically anxious people, both thought that this would indicate that Jenna is anxious or worried about something - maybe it is comforting to have Liz on the phone to help ground her for some time. On at least one of these phone calls Liz asked Jenna what she had been up to and how she was doing, her response was that it felt good to be at the lake. She grew up near the lake, it relaxed her, and she enjoyed being near it. Jenna mentioned to Liz that she had spent six hours just staring at the lake. Again, to Liz having grown up around family members who used drugs like meth, this sounded like she might have been using harder drugs. When Liz mentioned this conversation to other employees though, they mentioned that maybe Jenna was “at peace.” Liz and a couple of other people made comments like “Oh, good for her. I’m glad she’s found peace in her life.” As you’d think, being at peace would be great! The person who brought this up; however, provided a grimmer description of what it meant to be at peace. This person said that being at peace could mean that someone had reached a point in their depression where they were at peace with the hardships of life and at peace with the idea that suicide was the solution. With all other details, including that Jenna had up and left her apartment and all of her belongings at a moment’s notice, this felt like it might make all of the pieces of the puzzle fit, that maybe Jenna had made peace with the idea of ending her life and that she was enjoying her last moments peacefully by the lake in her hometown.

Unfortunately, I had no other possible ideas. I did suggest reaching out to the suicide hotline to see if they had any suggestions or idea. My other idea was this; presenting the situation to Reddit in hopes that either someone who has been through a similar life experience, or someone who might be a professional in mental health/drug abuse could provide some sort of insight. I am hoping for ideas on how Liz (or even myself even though I am outside of the situation and in a completely different city) can connect with Jenna to figure out what is going on or even peace of mind knowing that something else is going on. Please, if anyone has any helpful thoughts, Liz and I would love to hear them. Also, if anybody can connect me to another Reddit Community that might have people more well-versed in these areas that would be great.

Stay safe and healthy everyone!",29Mar2020,1

I am hoping for ideas on how Liz (or even myself even though I am outside of the situation and in a completely different city) can connect with Jenna to figure out what is going on or even peace of mind knowing that something else is going on. Please, if anyone has any helpful thoughts, Liz and I would love to hear them. Also, if anyone has any suggestions of other Reddit communities that might be able to help as well, please let me know.

Stay safe and healthy everyone!",29Mar2020,1
69,"I was dealing with depression and anxiety for sometime on my own. I was living in a different city away from home when it started so my parents were not aware. I started taking medications in January. Being on it has helped in returning home to explain what I've been going through to my parents.  

Being from Nigeria—a country in the western part of Africa, it's been difficult for my parents to see my depression as a mental illness rather they believe it's a spiritual attack that requires a spiritual approach. My mum believes it's the work of witches from our family. 

I returned home seeking for their support and understanding instead I'm being dragged from one pastor to another for prayers and it's becoming exhausting for me to bear.

My mum has been has been so worried and I know she cares so much but it's so difficult to explain what  depression is to her, especially since she believes it's a witch attacking me. That alone makes me sad. 

Africa is still a continent that doesn't see mental illness as a real thing and it makes me sadder.",29Mar2020,1
70,"So for the past couple weeks I've started experiencing what I think is some kind of dissociation?? Idk I've desperately tried to research what is going on. Basically I'll look and my mind will go blank I'll try to think but it feels like every thought i have gets sucked out of my head. I just have to sit and my eyes feel heaving and I just stare it's really intense. I noticed it happening alot a couple nights ago and now I have 0 memory of that night I can't remember barely anything before my boyfriend got home. When I checked my phone the next morning I saw I saved memes and photos that were really strange. I woke up this morning and it feels like my mind is extremely noisy it's been happening alot. My mind is filled with thoughts, self harming ones, good ones just all these kind of voices and they give me this huge headache and normally it passes after a while. It's happening quite more frequently today. It's 1pm and it's happened twice. Just the loud thoughts and headache. This is bringing up alot of anxiety and thoughts about previous trauma for me. I'm terrified I feel like my brain is trying to kill me and I'm scared to talk to anyone because I feel crazy. 

Any ideas? Help? 
P.s I hope everyone's okay at the moment I know these are tough times for everyone",29Mar2020,1

74,"TLDR; dump friend?

Screw it. No throwaway. I used to have a friend that we’ll just call Pesci. Pesci doesn’t like me anymore because, long story short they think I’m a complete monster and have me blocked on everything so I have no ways of speaking to them. And everyone that I am friends with knows about our past and how we aren’t friends, I’m dead to them and I really just want to sit down with them and explain that I am not who I used to be. One of my other friends, (we’ll just call him Marshall) always gets mad at me whenever I express sadness towards Pesci and I not being friends anymore. Saying that I should just move on and try my best to forget. But I will never be able to forgive myself until I get to speak to Pesci. So I was just wondering if Marshall is right and I should just try to forget about Pesci (which I’ve tried. Easier said than done) or if Marshall is in the wrong and if I should tell him to stop denying my suffering like a prick.
I was just wondering what to do. Because I’ve known Marshall for a long time but the only time we speak is when he’s angry at me for being sad about Pesci. And I’m scared if we stop being friends he’ll try to turn our mutual friends against me. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!",29Mar2020,1

76,"Don't get confused because of the messed up time zones. Here we go. My country's been on lockdown for close to 2 weeks now and I've done nothing but stayed at home with my sister, mum and dad. I've also been watching a lot and I mean A LOT of movies at the moment (most of them horror) and the worst , you could say side effect it's giving me was probably just a bit of headache. Anyway, last night I watched some movies, did some work, talked with family a bit and at around 2 o clock, readied my bed and went to sleep. Here's the fun part, I woke up at 5:30. And no, I wasn't awake I just opened my eyes and completely WOKE UP after 3.5 hours of sleeping. And guess what, the air conditioning was on. Here's the thing, where I live right now, the weather is very very pleasant. We don't get the ac's fixed by at least mid-April and here I'm laying in bed with the window open and the AC turned on. Now, I distinctly remember feeling warm and going to turn on the AC but I'm also aware of the fact that we don't use ac's this time of the year. So I turn off the ac, go back to bed and wake up to my alarm. Yes the alarm rang after I woke up. So I turn off the alarm on my phone (ancient button phone that doesn't even run internet. Very basic.) and I'm using this phone to open Instagram. After struggling to find it for about 2-4 minutes, I realise oh crap this phone cannot run instagram. At this point i'm severely judging my sanity and saying again and again ""Why would I do this? Why would I do that?"". After that moment I couldn't go to sleep so I went to my parents' room and slept till about 10 o clock.

80,"I am a 20-year-old student in New Zealand. My location is irrelevant but I thought I'd share it anyway.

I am currently in my third year studying for my Bachelor in Applied Computing. At a couple of previous jobs, I broke down in tears due to the stress - those two jobs were at McDonald's and a small business. I am afraid that even if I attain a Bachelor in Applied Computing, I am going to encounter great difficulty in the workplace purely due to pressure. I am afraid that even with my dedication to study that I will be disadvantaged in life because of my inability to manage my stress.

Furthermore, I feel discouraged when I do worse in an assignment or test than I should have, and sometimes it makes me feel like I will not survive in the real world.

My anxiety is a real nasty bitch, and when I am under pressure, for example, an on-the-spot question, I can't think and my mind goes blurry. This is one huge problem that will screw me over in the workplace.

I want others to lift all of these responsibilities they have made me accountable for, to forget about me and the hopes they placed there, and be allowed to rest,  endlessly. 
I need all of that to go away. Otherwise, I will keep trying. I know I must. I know I’m the mishap in my mother’s life that my family has tried to open space for, that my mother has tried to get over of; and I know that they expect me to be grateful by being the best person I can be. 

But I can’t; and even if I could, I’ve never wanted to. I only want peace, one that can exist only in the absence from other’s lives. There must be no burden in others, so that I don’t feel the need to make up for it. However, existing for myself might be easier in my death.

I have been experiencing mood swings since I was a teen or something like that, never went to any professional because at that point I thought it was just some ""teenager thing"", right now I am pushing to my early 20's and realized that it has been slowly spiralling out of control, sometimes I feel like the pain is unbearable and that I can't hold it anymore, crying myself to sleep and dreaming about people that used to help me calm down in the past, and just like that every trace of pain is completely gone (except my trashed room ofc) right now I don't really feel anything, it always swings between wanting to die, to complete apathy to intense energy, I just move as if my life counted on it, I constantly pushed my social boundaries without feeling much or getting sick (going out in the rain with summer clothes, dancing in the middle of the street, and pretty much being unfazed by any kind of climate change) during these episodes of explosive happiness or energy, I am incapable of feeling emotional pain until I switch to another mood, switching is constantly triggered by two facts each.
Sadness is constantly triggered by:
- Anxiety, people laughing while looking at me, or hearing people say my name can take me really fast.
- Myself, I constantly push myself to feel this way too, I start overthinking too much or forcing myself to feel sad
Apathy is constantly triggered by:
- Loneliness, when I am alone even when I have a lot of people surrounding me, I detach myself from the real world and pretty much any social interaction that I may have.
- Crying, If I have a ""sadness episode"" that's strong enough to make me cry, after that I feel completely apathetic, the pain just goes completely and i just feel, neutral.
The ""happy me"" is triggered by:
- Ego boosts, doing something that makes me feel better or puts me in a position of power, makes me go nuts, I feel like I have so much energy (that never goes off until I feel sad again), I can spend +24 hours without sleep, hunger is not a problem and I do so many things that will damage my ""other versions"", by not thinking in the consequences of my actions (spending too much money instead of saving it for hard times)
- Sometimes it just appears randomly, I just feel like I have too much energy and I start singing and dancing everywhere, sometimes I feel intense anger too or the need to tell somebody about some achievement.
Obviously there's way more to this, I don't even know what to expect posting this, I know for a fact that I need help of a professional but due to last time's energy outburst, I barely have money to hold for the rest of the month (sad college student noises).
Should I go to a professional ASAP, or should I wait and try other things around.
Right now I don't feel anything tbh, but when I am sad I am constantly crying about how I can't hold it anymore, so I guess I should treat it.",29Mar2020,1

The closest thing I could find to this was depersonalization, but I'm not sure how I could be experiencing that as a small child through young teen.

So I am having trouble going to bed. It's 2:40 am and I hear my mom screaming. It's in the past. I know it's not really happening but I'm hearing her scream from the time she got mad at me and I figure ""well darn, time to grab my journal."" 

And I start writing. Really casual too, what I am hearning, the emotions I'm re-feeling. Fear, anxiety, shame. 

And I sort of snap out of it as a write but I realize, ""holy shoot that was 2 years ago.""

I get memories like that that are from 4 years ago too, when I was out through conversion therapy. Now mentally, I'm tired of being the victim. I was the victim for so long (and I still very much am), but I am also a survivor trying to make my little spot in life. I'm tired of being scared of it, but the memories do flood back. My suicide attempts, my self harm; it come back to me every once and a while. I still get anxious I still get scared. Since writing the memories out (which was gut wrenching) it's calmed down significantly. 
I get some from 5, 6, 7, 8  years ago. when I came out to my parents. The rejection really messes with you.

But darn, I'm starting to think that I have some type of PTSD. But PTSD is isnt for long-term trauma no? 
It's so weird to even call it trauma? 

The memories aren't even the worst part? The worst part is not feeling worthy of love. I can deal with the memories most days but the lonliness, the fear of inadequacy is crippling. 

Anyways, this is way worse than I thought it was and admitting that I have some type of issue makes me feel good. Like, it's not just me, it's not because I'm weak, or a sissy ( I have a big issue with being weak, so much that I will hit myself to build tolerance). Stuff actually happened to me. I don't know how to fix it as I can't really find a therapist or a counselor nor do I have the money, nor do I have the space to try online (parents will get mad).

95,"Hi reddit im 21, this is my first ever post on reddit

Ive grown up in a small town on the south coast of nsw, Australia, i currently work in a super market.

When i finished my final year of school i got an average result i had no motivation for what i wanted to do.

At this time i had a girlfriend whom i met at the super market i worked at, we had been together for 2 years and from there moved to hobart, tasmania so she could study marine biology, we were madly in love, barley having any arguments, i started working at a supermarket again, while i was completing a diploma in graphic design, while she was studying at uni, making friends, while i wasnt making any friends and studying a course i didnt enjoy.

I enjoyed my own time aswell, playing video games etc. While when she was not studying, needed attention and for her it was hard to keep her self occupied if i needed some time to myself

I have a quite alot of self doubt and anxiety, not for my appearance but by my more quite introverted personality.

And so i never got along much with her friends and i never really enjoyed going to clubs, dancing and staying up till 3am unlike her.

We lived together for a year and eventually started sharing a house with one of her friends she made.

We still got along really well, though she wanted more attention from me which i found difficult to give. She was moving forward, while i was staying still, and this eventually led to us breaking up quite suddenly, it was somewhat mutual, though she wanted it more then me, i still couldnt leave though for the next couple of days, we still shared a bed together and still loved each other and when i left, we both were emotional and it was hard, but knew it would only get worse if our relationship stayed the way it was 

Im now back home in my small town, all my friends are off in other places moving forward with there lives, the life i had for myself is gone, my bestfriend and the woman i loved more then anyone else has moved on.
Im back in my house with my parents, with my old job, no friends around and going no where with my life, and no proper ideas on what i want to do, my only ideas would be a caring role such as aged care and even then im not sure.

Im lonely, have alot of self doubt, and have trouble making friends, my ex was amazing and beautiful and im worried i wont find anyone like her again. 

I dont know if i should go travelling, or move out and try move forward, but im full of anxiety and afraid to do anything, im surrounded by high achievers and im just not one of them. Ive put alot of pressure on my self all of a sudden, Im lonely and sad and i cant figure out what desicion to make. Some days i tend to feel better and think positive for a moment, but then i get incredibly overwhelmed and could be sad for the entire day. I feel worse in the mornings aswell, especially if i have dreams of my ex during the night.

Im lost, my brain is thinking of a several things a second and i cant relax, i miss the bond i had with my partner, and i relied on her to much for my happeness. I have no passion and i did enjoy video games, but know i cant play anything, because i feel im going backwards, and its the reason i havent been more outgoing and it just makes me sad. I enjoy surfing but i wouldnt say im passionate, and ive never been into competive sports, so ive never joined any. Theres also not much to do in my small town. I love camping and such, but only when im with someone else, and there is no one

96,"I don't know if I even suffer from anything. I don't want to die, but I don't love living. 

Last year I had a series of mental breakdowns and if somebody asked me, I really couldn't tell you what they were about. I remember last year I felt like I was under stress constantly. Between school and my social anxiety I just felt like my mind was about to snap.

That year my friends started basically ignoring me, and I began to feel like they hated me. That they talked about me behind my back and ridiculed me. It didn't help that   I was/am extremely socially awkward. I just felt like they all hated me and that I was alone.

With the people I did speak with, I acted totally different between each of them. I felt like I had to put on a different mask to talk to any person and none of them were really me. I wasn't feeling great to say the least.

During the summer I began sporadically crying for hours on end. I broke my phone not long after that, and during that following period I didn't get better really. My 'friends' at that point were regularly talking or getting together every day without me. I had nobody I connected with and I didn't know what to do.

When school started again I actually felt like I was getting better. I didn't feel under nearly as much pressure and everything started getting better. I had different friends then before, and talked very little with those I had had before. Then in late December, I got suspended for reasons I'd rather not disclose and shortly after a family member died. At that point I think I somewhat near snapped inside. For awhile I just felt like I was drifting through life unconnected to anything. 

The weird thing is I don't cry as often anymore. Of course I cried when my grandma died, but I don't frequently have complete breakdowns. I haven't felt strong emotion or paranoia like I did those months before summer since then. I don't know if this means I'm better or worse or anything. 

My new-ish friends are great but I still feel disconnected from them. I think some paranoia is still left over from what happened, but I feel like I'm happier with who I talk to now, but they aren't happy with me.

I'm pretty much an asshole to everyone I know. I treat people unfairly and harshly and I'm not sure why. A couple of months ago I tried to be better because of the suspension but I slipped back into old habits pretty soon. Right now I fell like I'm stuck in a hole and every time I try to climb out I fall right back into treating my friends like shit. 

I take responsibility for being a shitty person, but I'm struggling to stop. I know I'm responsible for how I treat others but I can't stop. Right now I'm attempting once more to be better and to get better, but I know it's only a matter of time.

98,"Hi, all! This post may be a little long, so my apologies in advance. My husband is 21 and I am 22. He went into the military around the time that I received a scholarship to my state university, so we’ve been geographically separated (I’m in California and he’s in Georgia) for the past four years on and off. It has been difficult but we have persevered very well. 

Aside from how well our relationship has gone, his mental health has progressively declined. He constantly tells me that our relationship is the only thing keeping him going and it’s really worrying me. He really doesn’t like being in the military because he is constantly made fun of. He is very quiet and admittedly, he is one of those people that other people like to pick on because he reacts how they want him to. I try giving him advice over the phone. I have Aspergers and I am no stranger to being bullied because of my social awkwardness. In fact, it’s something that I think brought the two of us together originally! But I can only offer so much help over the phone and sometimes I think I can be unknowingly insensitive. My advice just becomes repetitive words that eventually seem to go in one ear and out the other with him. 

I’m really worried that he might hurt himself. I can’t be there to make sure he’s okay and that scares me. I am graduating this May (virtually!) and he was supposed to PCS (move) to California last week. The Coronavirus made it to where he can’t move and we don’t know when the next time we will be able to see each other is and I’m worried that if he does something, I won’t know until it’s too late. I’ve considered telling his chain of command but I don’t want to risk his personal goals and career or make him feel even worse. I’ve asked him how he feels about being separated from the military and he told me that he would be ashamed to be discharged for mental health problems because people and veterans would “make fun of him”. He doesn’t tell me a lot of things because he doesn’t want to worry me, but I can tell when he’s hiding his feelings. If anyone has any guidance, I would really appreciate it. He feels like he is a burden to me but all I want to do is help him.",29Mar2020,1
99,"As much as we want to have it as our second home... it isnt. 

But saying that I can be misleading because there might be a chance for it to be a second home or even a first for some but it isnt at all easy to the point it isnt something that we can see happening well atleast in the right way. 

As many schools are trying we have seen the goals being achieved but only due to gaining issues with them that we didn't have. With money issues and most of all stress.

we cant put the pressure on teachers and the school to raise us when they didnt choose to have us...

Parents are there for that reason and they should take responsibility for us.

But what if you dont have parents?

What if your parents are abusive?
What if they are neglecting you?
What if they are poor and stressed and dont have time for you, What if they work all the time to make ends meet? 
What if they are drugged up somewhere ? 

What if you just dont have A parent to do the role of a parent? 

P.S.D lessons are there for that reason in my opinion and that's good and so much can benefit from these lessons but as we can see it is not enough because it only deal with easy stuff rather than the so common serious stuff. These lessons can help just a bit but not the whole school focusing on all of these students that need help. It is impossible to do so.

The time.
The money.
The rules.
The everything... 

Some schools want to help but the abusive parents wont let them.

Some schools want to help but the kids dont want to end up in care.

schools are there for academic purposes.
To get the grades and work.

Teachers studied for that reason only, not to babysit and take the role of parents even though so many want to. Its not easy.

Kids waiting to get a diagnosis for a mental health issues but it never arrives so no one has the ""right"" to take care of them in school..

It is difficult and schools are stressed to care for these kids. We should not be arguing with schools to care more, to do talk tackle mental health issues ecc we should argue with....

Stupid parents that keep getting pregnant and then choose drugs over their kids 

The governments care for these kids... The lack of health and social care. 

If schools are going to have to care for these kids with 

Mental health.
Physical health.
Food banks.
academic. 
life lessons.
and 
so 
much 
more

They should have training to not do a mistake and cause more harm than good.

They should get paid more as they are doing more work then supposed to.

The schools should have more benefits to get food ecc 

Might as well if these kids dont have a home to go to let the school be a boarding school.",29Mar2020,1

Tl;dr! My wife has delusions so strong she is metaphysically connected to a celebrity crush that she has never directly talked to or had any contact whatsoever. She wants to divorce me and we have four kids.

I’m completely lost with what to do here!!!

My wife(36) and I (39) have been married for 8 years together. We have had a tough go at it raising 4 kids. It hasn’t been easy for any of us. I’ve always loved her and wanted the best for her. Last week she told me that she wanted a divorce and it was because she was in love with someone else and that someone was a celebrity (tall and has Abs)

Naturally I went off the deep end because we have a house, kids, cars ... etc. I spent a few days away very angry and I came back home to face her and get the full story so that I could get some closure.

When I got home immediately I asked her to explain it. Expecting a specific response... I got something completely different. She told me that he’s been obsessed with her since 2013. I asked her how she knew that... and she said that they hadn’t actually met in person. I asked her if they just texted.. to which she replied... their communication is more subtle than this. When I asked for more elaboration, she was hesitant... but showed me that his communication to her was at first through Instagram posts. She started showing me subtle messages he was leaving her in every post to make is seem like he not only knew her but understood her deeply.

I was extremely shocked at this... but I played along and got her to explain it more to me. She told me that he is an expert hacker and can go into her phone and show her things. I asked her to elaborate and she said she would bring up safari and the first website would have been related to something she was thinking about and that this guy was sending her a message.

I continued to speak to her about this. This celebrity also talks to her telepathically. She even asked him if it was ok for us to speak about the subject in the first place in which she replied “He said yes and really likes you”.  He can send messages to her through the universe, in the form of songs and words or symbols. They are subtle but she can pick them up.

She also told me that she spent 3 hours at Costco walking around talking to him in a one sided conversation where he would answer her by chirping her ear phone bud. She told me she saw a video he posted about different houses he could live in and went to investigate a 25M household nearby. She phoned the realtor and took his email address and DM’d that guy to which he never returned anything. She told my kids that they were going to move into the household and that a new guy would be showing up soon.

All this from symbols and mental connections. None of it from any concrete communication. I asked her if he actually liked you, why not just DM you? Her reply was “if he replies then the world will know so he must be more discrete”. I asked if they have ever video talked and she said that she viewed a video interview between him and another couple and she laughed because it was like being on a date with him.

At this point I’m very worried. Does my wife have a mental illness? I have been through the gambit of emotions so far. I thought she was cheating on me... and I was so emotionally destroyed that I didn’t think I was going to make it... and I come home to find out she’s delusional or perhaps sick. Her delusion is that a very famous celebrity who dates many girls has a special mental and metaphysical connection with her that transcends the body... and that she doesn’t love me anymore and that I should move on.

WHAT THE FUCKING HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? I’ve never been so lost in my life. She’s my wife and the love of my life, the mother of my kids and the object of my affections, but she won’t even touch me and promises me that if I’m civil and help to take care of the kids... she will move out with this celebrity crush and help to pay for everything with all the money she will have. She even told our kids that she had so much money that money wouldn’t matter anymore. Someone please reach out to me so I don’t feel so alone.",29Mar2020,1

Since I was a child I always had a strong sense of shame, but I guess that's common for shy kids (now I'm not shy).

107,"I’ve lived with mum for a few years since an injury. I’m 38. I have a bunch of depression and anxiety issues and quite a few health issue that keep me from working like I don’t get enough REM sleep and often sleep for 24+ hours. I do try to work. And before the injury all I did was work full on in management. Was really great at it. 

But now I’m stuck at my mums. I’m glad she offers financial support and I do give her at minimum 300 dollars of my dole money. But she is super hard to live with. She often tells me other people in my position don’t live at their mum’s. She also denies a lot of stuff that caused some of my anxiety and depression. Like when I was 8 or 9 I discovered her dying from a suicide attempt. I saved her life by going to a neighbour. But she scoffs at me and says I don’t remember any of it. Says she going to call the neighbour and check my story is correct so she can prove I’m making up remembering it. Same with sexual abuse stuff. At first she denied it happened. Then when she believed it it turns out it’s my problem and she doesn’t want to hear about it and that it happens to everybody but nobody acts like a crybaby about it in their adult years. Also turns out one of my abusers abused her. 

She constantly scoffs at me and talks in a demeaning tone with random things. Often stuff like “I can’t wait until you find out I’ve sign all my house and your inheritance to..” so and so. It’ll be someone she knows with kids. But she hasn’t got any proper friends. 

Anyways. It’s every day all day. And no matter how hard I try to do as much as I can for her it only gets worse. I just survive knowing that she’s experienced trauma herself and she is surviving by not letting painful things in. She also has some kind of learning disorder as she can read decently but struggles with anything like basic paper work. And also her idea of the world is strange like she didn’t know how rockets go into space without hitting any of them stars. 

Some friends have always said she seems like she’s on the spectrum. Her brother is. But I couldn’t say that. Plus she doesn’t think she needs any mental health help. 

Anyways. I’m stuck here forever. I can’t get disability for my conditions. 5 years ago I could’ve but the government changed all that. I could not afford my own place. I got a little bit of cash. But it’d be gone trying to pay rent. Hopefully I can find the right job through my disability employment service. But it’s be minimum wage. My depression gets so bad I always think of dying but I couldn’t do that coz I have the best little dog. And I could leave him alone without me. And my depression was always manageable. It’s just her toxicity that wrecks me. I can be fine but she’ll barge into my room to tell me I have psychosis from my antidepressants or I have schizophrenia. I don’t. My psych knows I don’t. I’m just stuck here in the worst place I could think of. 

She also won’t go to family therapy because I go online and will work out how to make me look good and her look bad.",29Mar2020,1
108,"So we have been dealing with leukaemia since September, and the pandemic has really made that a whole lot harder. To avoid any risk, we made the difficult decision t put ourselves into social isolation to avoid any chance of her getting sick.

Being in isolation is really hard, especially when so many of us rely on our friends or family for support or enjoy activities that allow us to get out and about. For me personally, being active and getting outside is my favourite way of de-stressing, and clearing my mind. It's been hard being locked down, but i find comfort in being able to support her.

So, every day I sleep for 10+ hours if there are no chores (such as going to a class) (but even then for online ones i caught them last minute). I don't even sleep sometimes just lie in bed and do nothing. I am also weird when it comes to organization as for example I can clean my entire house but then not have the motivation to pick up one small object which will lie on the floor for a long time. I will sometimes but rarely just lie down in the middle of the room or my bed doing nothing.

Sometimes I have negative thoughts like whats the point of it all and whats the point of me being here but its on more of a logical sense and I won't act on them (like seriously, there is no need to worry and its very philosophical and not a big deal but just in case).

Sometimes I will also find it really hard to do basic every day tasks (eg taking a shower brushing teeth etc) and would sometimes procrastinate on stupid things (eg getting water even tho im thirsty)

Ive also had not the best of childhoods so possibly could be ptsd from there or something but I doubt it, it's just the lack of motivation that's really annoying me.

However, I am in a healthy shape, do enough exercise and am doing alright in life.

About a year after I graduated, I was in a horrible car accident where I was thrown from the vehicle and experienced a traumatic brain injury. The medics and my family said I was alive the whole time and trying to fight off the EMTs as they strapped me on the gurney rolling in to the hospital from the helicopter. But what I remember was being dead. I couldn't tell how long or where I was at, but I knew for sure that I was no longer living. After what seemed like literally eons, living in this dark eternal hole of nothingness; I was suddenly ripped back into life with a sudden and huge breath and it felt like I had been in a coma for years upon years but it was only 24 hours. I woke up and all my family was around me and I was grateful to be alive and well. 

Fast forward 5 years and I'm finding it harder and harder to be grateful. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy to be here to make my family and friends happy when ever possible. But I just cannot get myself out of this sinkhole. My anxiety is so high ill be awake for 36 hours straight just sitting in my house panicking about life and my future, and then my depression drags me back down and I sleep for two days, all the while my family and friends are wondering where I've gone and if I'm ok. I've suffered things from the wreck that I've never told anybody about. I've never told anybody but Reddit, just now, that I died; and the second worst thing ill reveal, is that i don't feel like i actually survived the wreck. Coupled with making me forget all the faces and memories of past friends and family from before the event, it has completely crushed who I am as a person. 

I had BEST friends that I had spent my ENTIRETY of my childhood, middle school, and high school career with that, after the wreck, I would see them in the flesh, and I would feel so awkward and uneasy as If I was talking to a complete stranger. This has devastated me and even my family has noticed these occurrences. ""what is wrong Anon? don't you remember Anon2 and all the good times you had in high school?"" and I would just freeze and begin to panic and have to turn away and leave the situation.

119,"Hi. So I have this problem were I tend to be overly affected by whatever thought/feeling I have either creating from external sources or internal sources. I don't show my mood swings, I try to show always I am the same as always. These are just feelings I feel inside and try to keep them in order to cause unnecessary stress to other people. So I guess there are 3 states that are predominant in me: a state of over happiness and excitement (this is most of the times a good thing, but it's never a durable feeling and it's doesn't happen that much often , or it's a feeling of despair and hopelessness (this doesn't happen everyday, but surely is more common than the happiness one [and tends to last a bit longer]). And there's the most common: the normal feeling (I don't feel great, don't feel completely relaxed either, feel slightly sad but not that much, but I feel like this is a state I can familiarize with and this overall allows me to be more stable through the day [and this is where I feel I can go either way depending if the events that happen around me are too stressful or big]). A plus is that when I see something funny enough I can still laugh so it's not all bad.
But I feel this process has to change. So I was 2 weeks of work and I tried to improve a bit on this. I did some things and applied some habits, but there were some days I couldn't do what I intended (lack of motivation). And if I am home and this happens, what if I go back to work. This is clearly not a good sign.

121,"I (21m) had one of the worst days I’ve had in a LONG time yesterday. 

Let me give you a little backstory. I’ve been mentally ill my whole life, and throughout middle and highschool, and early adulthood, I was in and out of psych units. I’m diagnosed borderline, osdd, schizoaffective, and a whole other laundry list of things. 

I don’t know what happened or what triggered it, but I woke up into one of the worst panic attacks of my life yesterday. The physical symptoms were ridiculous and lasted for hours, and mentally it was just turmoil. Intense intrusive thoughts and sh/suicidal urges, just general spiraling.... it was bad. At about 2pm I took as many sleeping meds as I safely could, and tried to pass the fuck out. I ended up waking up several times, but managed to sleep mostly until about 6am. 

Now onto today. I feel like fucking garbage. No trigger, at least not an apparent one (I’m usually pretty good at identifying triggers). I’m not panicking anymore thank god, but the depression is hitting HARD. I mean hard. To the point where if I actually could, I’d probably go inpatient again (but for several reasons including the current pandemic, I can’t). 

I’m physically safe. I know I can keep myself from doing stupid shit. But man those thoughts will NOT leave my head. I just, I can’t even describe really WHAT it is. Dread, severe depression, I don’t know... but what I do know is that I cannot manage this. 

I’m quarantined at the minute and am not allowed to visit any friends or family, which is what I’d usually do when feeling like this. I don’t have the energy to talk directly to friends online at the moment. I can’t bring myself to do anything, and I’m not enjoying anything; nor is anything distracting me. I’ve tried basically everything I’ve learned through years of therapy and DBT, yet nothing is working. 

I’m struggling so fucking much. I can’t eat because I’m nauseous, I can’t think properly because I have a migraine, I can’t distract myself because of intrusive thoughts. It’s just absolute hell. I feel at a complete loss. 

It’s at this point I really wish I wasn’t over 5 yrs clean of sh or over 6 years clean of suicide attempts, so i could actually fucking feel something that isn’t this.

But now, the real problem is my panic attacks. Before this covid pandemia i went to work and live abroad to other country. I wanted to experience everything and meet nice people all around the world. It was amazing, i loved it. But i got my first panic attack in other country and i didnt know what was happening. I was panicking so hard that i called ambulance for myself haha.

So, when the ambulance finally arrived i was still on full panic mode. They tested my heart rates etc and everything seemd fine, So i was wondering what the h\*\*\*\*. Then i discovered panic attacks. 

I have recently gotten a lot of panic attacks. Like once or twice a week and they are getting worse. Is there anybody who has been succesfully treating panic disorder without ssri? I dont want to get on that medication.

Btw if you want to hear that full ambulance story and afterwards please let me know haha.

My parents are doing their best to support our family and my best friend is working hard to achieve her goal. I appreciate it and feel proud of them. And I remind myself that I should do my best too. Unfortunately, I’m losing my motivation. I feel so void on the inside. Even when shitty things happen and random strangers do something that’s really offensive to me, I don’t really react to it and move on. Even when something really exciting n nice happens, I don’t really feel the happiness like I used to have before. Whatever happens, I feel stuck and unmotivated. There has been this thought of just throwing my life away in my head lately. I used to care about things and react to certain circumstances like a normal human, but now I just feel so unmotivated, stuck, emotionless and ready to give up my life anytime.

Now where I'm conflicted is that I could just be overreacting. And if I do get the courage to book one, should I go when I'm in a good mood or when I'm a low mood? Because when I'm in a ""good"" mood, I'm in denial about everything I'm going through and it's just a rough patch.

So my question is, while i don't feel bad whenever my parents tell mean things to me ( I deserve it most of the time) but after hearing it for a long time everyday, I'll lose my mind and start screaming, crying and walk out of the house. I usually have a smoke and talk to friends to calm down.

The most recent one is from today. My mum visited me for the weekend. I don't live here too, but I used to when I was in high school, so for most of the year the flat is empty. However, I came back here due to the covid-19 pandemic since it's much closer to the rest of my family. 

The last time I was here (about 3 weeks ago) I organized pantry and fridge but I came back to everything haphazardly thrown in the fridge because mum thought she saw a pantry month when she came by a week ago. I hated how it looked but not enough to fix it in a couple of days since I've been here.

Anyway, I had to buy some fresh produce and missing pantry items so I could self-isolate in peace without going outside and thus I filled the fridge even more. It was a mess, but an acceptable one. My mum came on Friday and squeezed in some more food because she didn't think we had any (???). 

For most of the weekend I had control over the fridge but I lost it today. 

Mum simply packed some food home and cooked dinner. The end result was distressing enough to throw me off for the rest of today. 

Food doesn't fit in the fridge the right way. I have no idea what is missing, it looks like I'll have to go buy food soon when I know it should have lasted way longer. Chinese cabbage is ruined (who cuts it this way?), baby tomatoes aren't in their container (and for whatever reason it's the worst thing about all of that) and 2/3 of the container worth of tomatoes is missing. The cucumber is cut weird. I know full well mum had bought her own tomatoes so why the heck did she mess with mine when they were in the back of the fridge? She also left some stuff she bought ""for herself"" that I know will be wasted because I don't eat stuff like this (she didn't take home all of what she bought) and many, many more irking details. It's not funny how much it affects my mood. It all sounds trivial but it affects me so much I can't even focus.
As for much simpler situations that I hate in the exact same way, they are taking the cutlery container out of the dishwasher (even when someone else does it) or putting back the hoover.

The last example stems from me never being able to do it correctly enough according to my pedantic mom when I was younger.

I hate this feeling, especially because it's with me for hours after the fact and I know I shouldn't react like this, but I do anyway. 

Any advice on how can I deal with this?

PS. These situations don't affect my daily life because I live alone and I don't have (m)any triggers that concern public places. To be honest, I can only think of one and that is how the online learning platform my uni uses is organized.",29Mar2020,1

I'm feeling really low because the past ten years, I have had great trouble navigating through my depression. My moments of hope last for a short amount of time before I'd isolate in my room. I know I am capable of being successful, but count myself out before really trying. I attended three different colleges, and ended up withdrawing or failing due to severe depression. I'm worried that if I were to enroll in a community college again, that even if I did really well with an AA Program, I'd have great difficulty finding a school to transfer due to poor transcripts.

I got my first referral when I was 17, after years of putting it off. I was referred to CAMHS and they turned me away because I would be 18 by the time I got to the front of the waiting list.

Then when I was at uni I kept going to my GP and all he did was offer me antidepressants. He wouldn't even listen to my symptoms. He just heard ""mental health"" and tried to prescribe them to me. I didn't know you could self refer to therapy.

When I was 21 I found out you can self refer to therapy and did. Then right after that I got kicked out of uni for my mental health and had to move away, meaning I couldn't go any further with that referral.

I moved to London but I was technically, legally homeless, so I couldn't register with a GP because you need proof of address (and you need to be registered in order to self refer). I was trying to get registered for about a year. Then I finally moved somewhere legally and I could register. I self referred but then they took me off the system because I didn't reply to a letter that I never received. They said I could refer again in a few months. 

I ended up going to A&amp;E one day and I got really lucky. They actually took me seriously and I was referred to a psychologist, who saw me the next week. She was great and she offered me 5 more sessions. But then I got fired because of my mental health and I had to move back home (which I really, really didn't want to do) immediately. So I lost those sessions.

I registered with a GP back home and self referred to therapy. I finally got an appointment and we talked through everything. The lady said that I'm medium risk and the only reason I'm not high risk is because I assured her I'd be okay for four weeks. She said that I'm too much for them though (I have dissociation, extreme mood swings, severe anxiety focusing mainly on health and death, and a history of trauma) and referred me for a ""specialist mental health assessment"". 

I got a letter about it and I called the number. They told me my referral hadn't been processed yet and to call back in a week. I did and they said the same thing. This went on for about a month. Then they told me that my referral is cancelled, to start again once COVID-19 is over and to call the Samaritans if I need to, even though when I have a bad mood swing my brain doesn't work like that.

I don't know what do do. Everything is worse. The dissociation, the mood swings. The anxiety is through the roof given what it tends to focus on.

I just don't know how I can survive this year. Either COVID-19 will kill me or my mental health will.

I need your advice.

I started a new job as an administrative assistant last week for a big corporation. In my previous job I was an administrative assistant also but the main reason I took this new job is that I have always wanted to have an opportunity to work for a successful corporation. Unfortunately I always tend to overthink and believe that I will always fail at whatever I do. I get anxious and stressed easily.

158,"Dear Reddit,

This will be a very long and serious post and I really hope that someone can realate or even help me out of this. 

First of all, the resason i do that post is to get a clear mind because all I can feel right now is massive hopelessness. There are a lot of symptoms which bother me to an extent where I cannot enjoy my life anymore.

I will start describing me as a person and what happened so far in my life to give you an insight:

I am a male in his mid-twenties, living in Switzerland. I went to college and finished after a troublesome time about 5 years ago. Since then my life has been a total mess. First, while I was about to finish school, I've been diagnosed with AD(H)D. After having read through its diagnostic criteria, I have felt really good as I've felt completly understood. I was sure that my AD(H)D made my time at school so harsh (the conflicts i got into with teachers, the short-lived attention-span, the hyperfocus ability and so on). I tried Ritalin and later Dexamphetamine and I was, for the first time, capable of focusing on the important tasks that life brings with it. I've felt quite good after I got my degree. Then I decided to attend university and i moved along with one of my best friend into an appartment in another city. I was almost overly happy and my goals to become successful an wealthy kept me going. When I started at the university I got bored really fast. As I noticed the huge amount of learning that was lying ahead, my mood quickly decreased and I almost felt a bit depressed. I told myself that it would be okay to take a year off and just chill. I started having really good times with my friend as we got into weed (cannabis). Whereas he continued his studies, I broke up with university and focused on enjoying life to its fullest. I smoked almost 10 Joints a day and I felt really good at first. I would describe it as the best time of my life so far and I am sure that this will not change. When I told my parents that I am not going to even try my studies, they told me that I have to come back to them after half a year. I managed to convince them that the subject at university was just not the right one for me I would take the test in another subject. So after almost 1 year, I finally moved back to my parents. By this time I got diagnosed the first time with low-grade depression. To counter that feelings, I decided to party a lot and just spend the money I've saved up in my teens. Also I did try some party drugs like MDMA and still smoked week on a daily basis (at this point I did not know the connection between MDMA and depression or lets say that its especially harmful for people who already are depressed). Quite quickly I noticed that after consuming 'harder' drugs theres 'down-phase' which was almost killing me. So I stopped using this kind of drugs after about 1/2 year and tried some antidepressants. As I did not have to learn for university at that time, I ceased my AD(H)D-stimulants. The antidepressants did not help and I tried almost 10 different ones back then. I felt extremely numb and as I lived a 'high-life' that time it way extremely unpleasant to somehow not feel anything at all anymore. After I finished abusing party drugs, I convinced my parents that I cannot live with them anymore and that I would be better off living alone. They accepted that and supported me financially regarding an own little appartment with 1.5 rooms somewhere near them. I started my second try at university but again could not force myself to really go there, so I abandoned it again. My parents were really disapointed and told me to find a job. I really wanted to study rather than just going to work but on the other hand could not force me to learn stuff that I was not interested in. I thought about my goals in life an tried to find out in which direction I really wanted to go in life. As I could not have figuered out a passion I just applied for a desk job and worked there for 1.5 years until I subscribed to a psychiatric day-clinic as I've felt so bad that I did not see any other option. There Ive been diagnosed with clinical relevant depression, anxiety disorder (because I had several panic attacks a week back then) and again ADD. I've received Concerta (slow-release Ritalin), Trittico (Trazodone) to be able to sleep better and Vortioxetine (which I could not take because of the insane nausea I got). After 2 months I've gotten sent home again. As I did not feel much better I went to a local psychiatrist. He wrote me a prescription which said that I was 100% unable to work and tried to treat me. I still got paid by my comany's insurance for about 1 year. Then they sent me the official resignation letter (which I expected already because I was unable to work for a very long time). Since then I am mostly playing video games at home and try to go for a walk every day. I completely lost all my hopes for my life to recover. Since about 1.5 years I experience extreme physical weakness all over my body and in addition non-restorative sleep. I litarally feel like I was 90 years old and about to die very soon. I set a new goal as this all started which is to figure out what I really have. I did a LOT of testing with different doctors and what irritates me the most is, that I do not feel nearly as depressed as I was. 2 different sleep studies told me that its probably a mental problem even if 1 lab suspected UARS as well (a special for of apnea which has not been studied a lot so far). What they did found is SIBO (small intestinal overgrowth) but even after taking the two most appropriate antibiotics, I do not feel very diffrent. I suspected CFS and UARS. I am still not sure if I am really suffering from PEM though as I feel so weak all the time anyway. I tried CPAP for a potential UARS-cure but I cannot tolerate it.

I miss my old life so much that I often dream about it. Its all gone and will probably never come back. I cannot be all in my head this time... The fatigue every day and the weakness are destroying everything. I thought about my brain taking this as an excuse for not having to get back to normal life. I am very afraid of the future and I've lost all my hope. I am nervous but tired at the same time, all day. When I try to do sports, I have to quickly stop it because I just cannot tolerate it anymore. I feel so weak that even taking a shower costs me a lot of effort. Theres a lot of pressure now on me because I know that the longer I am into this, the higher the chances of not getting out anymore. A lot of friends tell me that they are also tired and feeling the same but I know how life felt in the past (at least for me) and I can 100% tell that theres is a huge difference to how I feel now.

Now the reason why I posted all this is because I would like to know if anyone experienced something similar and got out of it again. Like waking up like you did not sleep at all, muscle weakness, no motivation, no goals and dreams, no hope that you can recover and trapped everyday in that vicious cycle. And when yoh actually try to fight it, you noticed how weak your whole body feels and how impossible it seems to every get out of it. Everyone its progressing in life but not me. Time is running and doctors cannot help. So if anyone know this or experienced this at least to some extent, please write it down. I cannot thank you enough and I know its a lot to ask to read that all and try to help a stranger but I am really stuck in a situation which I cannot escape alone.

I can't talk to my therapist because I won't have any privacy currently, and violation of my privacy/boundaries just makes me feel worse. I'm not suicidal. I won't try anything.

160,"Hey guys! I’m just curious if you guys can relate or went through the same thing. My family all struggle with mental illness and I had so much trauma growing up I could barely enter my home. My sister got diagnosed with BPD and I was diagnosed with bipolar. I wonder sometimes if I grew up with a different family would I be happy? or “normal”?. All my feelings and depression and bipolar like symptoms began when I was just 12 and started to understand what was going on in my home and what I had witnessed I began to understand. The same things pushed my sister to end her own life ( she is fine now and has recovered ). My sister moved when she turned 18, and child protective services tried but didn’t work out like that since I was still at home. anyways enough about me did your family or something you experienced as a child cause trauma or still affect you now? I understand when things happen to children they hold great effect and children remember these things and it stays with them forever. I wanna know is this the story for majority of people? Maybe it isn’t family or it’s some other type of abuse or maybe you were diagnosed without any type of trauma? just curious maybe this is a stupid question but thanks if you do reply!! :)",29Mar2020,1
161,"Using a throw away.  Sorry for a long post. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression by my primary care provider to try paxil/ zoloft but I gave them up before they had any affect, mostly just because the idea of medication and appointments seemed too daunting at the time (pathetic, I know). I tend to think I have ocd and PTSD that isn't diagnosed and am not sure how to go about getting diagnosed and have not seen a reason to because for a long time I kind of just assumed everyone is messed up and I don't /need/ the help even if something is wrong. It isn't debilitating, but it is starting to affect every aspect of my life. My relationship with my husband is very strained and close to the end and I'm not able to ever relax or feel happy. I work a full time job and do fine at it, but as soon as i clock off my entire being is exhausted and i have no energy for self care. My PTSD stems from sexual abuse as a teenager and neglect and  possibly more abuse as a child. I imagine this is the reason that once I had children my anxiety switched to ocd with me obsessing over people trying to hurt them/SIDS and compulsively checking and counting their breathing/locking doors/ peering out windows to make sure no one is out to get us. Intrusive thoughts and nightmares are prevelent as well. Basically my question, for anyone who relates to any part of this post is did treatment or a diagnosis improve your life? And if so were there any ways it improved it that you weren't expecting? Im starting to think most issues in my life are linked back to my mental illness and just want to know there is hope for my life to be ""normal"" again.",29Mar2020,1
162,"this time is full of tragedies. all over the news is just panic and death. We are all feeling the stress and pain of the pandemic. The government officials are of course also feeling this stress, a minister in Germany very sadly took his own life today. He was under immense pressure and decided there was only one way out. But i’m here to remind you that there ARE other options. We may not all have the responsibility of looking after a country, but right now we are definitely all feeling the pressure. it seems surreal, our lives suddenly at a stand still. I know that many of you don’t have access to the things that help you cope with whatever mental difficulties you face, and i shared the feeling of despair we all felt when we realised that we could be locked up with just ourselves and our minds for months. A dangerous combo, my mental illness and me and without my daily routine and outside distractions i was sure i would sink right back into the dark place i fought so hard to get out of.  But we can do it, we can make it through this extra difficult time, it just needs some extra strength. And don’t lie to me, reddit stranger, i know you have strength and i think you’re stronger than you know. So push through this time, make yourself a routine, try to duplicate your normal life to stay as positive as possible. Remember your mental illness isn’t something you can magically remove, so these added pressures and the constant talk of death is likely to make it harder and that is ok. you are valid. but you aren’t allowed to just give up. We don’t need anymore tragedies in this time. We don’t need any more deaths ever. period. But thats up to you, whether it’s looking after your own mental and physical health, or checking in on others, no matter if they are openly suffering or not. Please care for yourselves and eachother in the awful time. Your family, your friends, your dog, cat, hamster and fish all care about you. And if there is no one left, I care about you.

163,"I'm....between therapists at the moment but I recognize that I need therapy. This whole outbreak could not have come at a worse time (Or, more realistically, I shouldn't have put off getting a new therapist, it's my fault). My last therapist was kind, gentle, sweet, but I don't feel like we really made progress (I don't think I learned a single coping technique). So I decided I would try a new one, a daunting process. The idea of having to explain myself all over again to someone totally new just sounds exhausting. 

Now we're all stuck at home and therapists want to do telehealth sessions. I understand why, I get it, I really do. But the problem is I fucking hate video chatting. The idea of spilling my guts to someone behind my computer screen (and that somehow....helping?) just sounds absolutely awful. I won't feel any connection, I get to see my own stupid fucking face the whole time, the environment doesn't feel private (I live with my gf), and I'll just want to curl up in a ball the whole time.

1. She shouts a lot - irrational accusations and a lot of yelling and screaming.

2. She moves her lips and nods as though she is talking to someone, almost constantly,

5. She has weird theories- like someone wants to attack her, or someone had sex with someone, or someone thinks something about her.

&amp;#x200B;

\[EDIT: Seattle, WA\]

Call it poor timing, but I defended my doctorate in December and I've been working through adjusting to life since then. I started work with my current employer away from school over a hear ago, and I left an abusive advisor when I started work. Following my defense the only personal time I've taken was a 3-day weekend where I did a short trip a few hours from where I live. Even though I intellectually know I'm allowed to control my own life again, the adjustment has been an emotional roller coaster.

Now I find myself in a period where I feel like I need to escape my (hopefully, normal and healthy) frustrations surrounding my work but I don't really know what I would do with myself. I feel like without a reason I'm wasting my time to just ""not do work"" for a while, and if I don't come back feeling any more refreshed than when I went in then what have I accomplished by taking time off? This was going to be a challenge for me even before the shutdown of various businesses in my area.

My go-to actions would normally be to workout or walk to deal with short term stresses. Longer term stresses would usually drive me to meet up with my Dad (we are both engineers in the same industry and related technical backgrounds) but the restaurant closure paired with him supporting my grandparent's isolation during this mess has prevented me from doing that. The last time I took a real vacation was 2015, and even then I was half way around the world working on grants for my professor at the time to hide it. Before the order I had been contemplating trying to get a trip in in March/April, but I have no idea how to plan that anymore even if travel restrictions weren't in place.

tl;dr I'm at a loss for how to unwind and relax. I didn't have a good way to do it before, and my options seem even more sparse now.",29Mar2020,2

I was taking medications in this period mainly Seroxat and Wellbutrin for almost 6 years, never felt they made a difference but whenever I tried to stop any of them, I used to have a lot of snappy mood and couldn’t control myself, so I used to just halt this plans

Till I got some balls and stopped Seroxat and with the help of my doctor I replaced it with Lexapro, which reduced withdrawal symptoms drastically and in the beginning it made me feel like a please t person, but in the end, I had the goal to stop all of the medications , especially that the pleasant person feeling got vanished away, so once I got laid off and a paid vacation of 30 days I stopped it completely.

Now I am not saying I regret it but the feelings I have is, less talkative, can’t focus easily (bad procrastination episodes) and can’t draw a smile easily on my face, also gets irritated super easily with my child ( snapping without physical or verbal abuse or humiliations, just the kind of leave me alone or snapping “Concentrate more”)

What should I do now? Therapies do t work with me, every time I make these psychology sessions it never helped, medications did sometimes but u hates this dependency, but in the end, what should I do to focus more at my work and give better attitude to my kid and family and be a chill person in general, was thinking about taking Adderal and Zoloft

175,"Honestly I’m writing this because no one knows anything about me and here I just can express myself. In the real life I told my several friends about how I’m feeling but people have different perspectives and opinions and experience so I would like to just express myself on here. I will start from the current situation. Basically I am a female, living in another country, not in my homeland(let’s say from a harsh Slavic surrounding), and due to the quarantine I have been feeling very self focused. Because being with myself and seeing myself every day, being face to face with my problems and thoughts is very harmful. So I’m feeling very depressed. There are several things that trigger me the most right now: my looks (I have BDD), corona crisis and all this situation (I have anxiety), suicidal thoughts I’m having every day and people started triggering me a lot. As for a mentally unstable person I have a good skill to self analyze myself but right now I need some help. 
I feel more and more ugly. I don’t wear makeup these days and weeks and seeing myself being naturally ugly, not enough and disgusting just provokes me to think of worse things and hate myself 24/7. I think about it every second. I’m trying to imagine something better that when this whole thing is over I will go to the doctor, make myself better looking, solve my health issues, feel better. But suicidal thoughts give me more pressure and just don’t give me any hope at the same time. 
Corona situation gives me an idea that after all of this I will struggle a lot. It scares me, it makes me feel paranoid and anxious. I feel unsafe and insecure.  I know rn I’m at a better place, a good European country but it still makes me feel so unsafe. 
I have always wanted to commit suicide and I tried it 3 times. Right now it seems to be the best idea. 
People tell me I have so much to live for and I shouldn’t complain. They tell me I have looks, I’m a model, I might have a lot of further contracts and shit so I have to live, that I’m talented and have a good heart so I have everything to live for. But I honestly don’t see. I honestly don’t understand why I exist, for what and how to deal with what I have inside. I tried a treatment if anyone wants to mention seeking for a professional help. I tried it in my homeland and it was terrible. Here I can’t get it because of bureaucracy. 
People started triggering me a lot. Well, particularly, men. Because everyone is locked down men are very active right now and they “hit” on me a lot without knowing how much I am hurt inside. I try to put myself away from the social media, attention because that’s what triggers me a lot. But it doesn’t seem to help me. I even started being less interested in men, than in women. 
I’m very lost. I don’t know what to do in the future. Do you think isolating myself completely (no internet, social media, people) is a good idea or a trigger ? Right now my every day life is just full of triggers and pain. I know I described my feelings kind of shallow but if you want to know anything more about me in order to give me thoughtful advice, I’m open. I just really want to reach to people. Maybe some had the same feeling , the same period of having these mental conditions and feelings.",29Mar2020,2

177,"I really need help. Is it possible to accidentally realize I might have dissociative identity disorder even without any professional help? I absolutely am not going to self diagnose myself with such a serious condition. I've been trying to figure out what's wrong with me for years and years now and I never even considered this as a possibility until someone mentioned DID, so I got curious and only read a tiny bit about it. 

After I read one thing, ""The host usually isn't aware of the other identities"", I had to close the search bar because everything in my brain went very bad. 
Ive had voices in my head for years, I'd just assume they were Intrusive Thoughts and move on. Even when these voices started occurring, they never felt right. I would say they aren't my thoughts. And I'm practically certain that they aren't now.

I'm not really good at explaining this in an orderly manner but what I can say for certain is that I have lots of childhood trauma I blocked out. occasionally with the people im closest to, I only know I told them everything at some point. But I don't actually remember telling them. The only things I remember from my childhood are like, the ""titles"" of each traumatic event. I couldn't really tell you any details of it if I tried. 

I don't have a therapist, only a psychiatrist. So I am prescribed medicine and diagnosed for Major Depressive Disorder, Anxiety, and ADD/ADHD. 

I've been begging my family for help, for a doctor, ever since I finally got the courage to tell them what's going on with me. Because I've struggled with self harm and substance abuse. Along with a few other things that are a bit harder for me to explain. 

I know occasionally I've had moments where I get really bad and all of the sudden it feels like im on autopilot. And that's usually when I start self sabotage or self harm. 

I can give so many examples of the symptoms I think resemble this disorder, but I feel so confused and lost. I can only talk to one of the voices. Which I didn't even realize I could until last night when I was freaking out. 

I'm refusing to self diagnose, as I've said before. But  my family doesn't care enough to even try to get me an actual doctor, even if we actually can't afford it, they put no effort in trying. Or listening to me.

I see things like shadows crawling and moving around the room and I always feel like there’s something in the corner of my eye. I literally can’t do anything sitting still without constantly looking around the room frantically. And i can never sit or lie down in a room with my back to a door. I haven’t been able to fall asleep until I’m physically unable to keep my eyes open. The earliest I sleep is about 5am if I’m lucky but that only because I force myself to exercise at night to exhaust myself. I’m in physical pain from exerting myself and mental torture from the paranoia and anxiety I have at night.

Impulsive in the context of mental health is another thing. If I get impulsive it has a tendency to spiral quickly to self harm and then being suicide attempts.

Sometimes (with my meds not helping) I feel like I will wake up and this will be a dream, because my fear-dreams aren’t far off. Having a disorder that is immunocompromising is not helping at all either. I slept until 4pm today. Mostly because I was (unwillingly) awake for 52 hours straight. No naps, no respite. But I think part of my conscious brain was like ‘when you are asleep the world is ok’ and I just kept sleeping. I don’t even have the desire to write right now. Everything I held sacred is up in the air, unsafe, no net. There is also something almost romantic about this. I don’t mean romantic as in desire, I mean it as unreal- exotic enough to be enticing but scary enough to be exorcised of all such enticements. Sometimes though, however scary it may be, living as if you were dreaming is intoxicating. Especially when you have an underlying illness that gets shunted to secondary in importance. I don’t think about my bipolar except as it relates to my immunity. That part of my brain has been enveloped with fear of this virus. Which is not exactly better, but those of us with a mental illness will know what I mean. A break, any break, from thinking about your illness can be a relief, no matter how tragic.

My view right now as I sit in bed is loud. Things that need to get done. There are piles of clothes on the built-ins that need to be washed. The ivy in the window needs to be watered. There is a bottle of face wash that I no longer use but my friend uses waiting to go to her if I can ever leave the house. There is a fan waiting for the suffocating heat of summer that is inevitably coming our way. There is a pile of vintage negligee waiting to be photographed and posted for sale. Everywhere I look there is something that needs to be done. Even when I look in a mirror at my own reflection. Right now I can’t tell what I look like. All I see are methods of transmission. Viral opportunities. I hear the church bells ring outside. But where before they were the ramblings of a quaint town, now they seem ominous. A death toll. I take a drink. ‘What if it gets in the water?’ I wonder. How many people will die of either the virus or perish of thirst? Surely we can boil it and kill the virus. There will be an overflow of water-based drinks in the stores. People fighting over kettles. What will the new mutation of the virus look like? It’s already started and will naturally be stronger, more lethal. I need to shower. Now I am afraid of water. It’ll take just one case before we find out it’s in the water- what if I am that one case? My mind is racing. This is what it is like most mornings. Whether there is a virus or not, my mind will race like this. It is evolutionary I know. Fear is useful to our species. Quieting it is quite simply impossible, unnatural. To quiet the mind is to quiet survival. So my thoughts flit around, hungry for something to grab onto like a mosquito on a vigilant host. 

The only silver lining to all this horror is that things we took for granted we now hold close. They seem so beloved now. Even errands. What once we rolled our eyes at and sighed an exasperated sigh at the thought of, we crave. Normalcy is now only a spectator sport. Normalcy is Rapunzel’s hair. A fairy-tale hope. A braid woven of good intentions, hushed promises, and a way out.

The symptom is a sort of lack of sentience or consciousness. I know it's typical of somebody with e.g. NPD to have little to no insight, but I'm talking a step further: not only not thinking about one's actions or how those actions affect those around them, but a lack of thought about almost... anything? Being sort of completely removed from almost every situation, yet still acting ""normal"", just being as agreeable and shallow as possible, meaning one can put on an (extremely convincing) facade that nothing is wrong with them and that they function in social society, yet never really having to be a unique person who thinks for themselves. That last part is really important. I am talking about somebody I know, and what's defining about them is that they're always sort of ""escaping"" their own thoughts, keeping busy and preoccupied rather than thinking about their life, being their own person, etc.

My older brother (22 M) has had an extremely rough couple of years. He dropped out of college and has been living at home. He had some troubles with the law that really fucked up his life. He was on probation for a year and a half and it was for some serious shit. He’s been in and out of jobs because he can’t find anything he likes. He struggled with lying to my parents about his work, he doesn’t like his job and then quits but doesn’t want to disappoint them by telling them he quit so he lies. It doesn’t make sense but I understand that it’s a short term solution for him. He isolates himself and doesn’t open up to anyone. His friends from HS are all but out of the picture. He’s been to therapy for depression and has been on pills before, but I don’t know a lot of details because my family doesn’t tell me. He’s really very much not well and it’s easy to see. I can see his unhealthy habits (for both physical and mental health) and I try to encourage different ones but I don’t know how anymore. Not to say that there isn’t a way, I just can’t see it. I’m 19 (M) and just had my first year of college but I came home because of COVID. My brother hasn’t been working because of the Corona Virus, so my parents are kicking him out of the house. Except part of the reason is because he lied again about the reason why. there’s no real reason to it that he’s said. He just lied. I don’t understand it. He had asthma in the past so he said that’s the reason why but I think it’s because he’s lazy or doesn’t like the job. Which doesn’t make sense to me because he seemed to really like this job! So it hurts seeing my family torn apart by this, but I understand the toll it’s taken on my mom the last few years. It’s a lot of stress for her to live under and she’s cracked saying he’s got two weeks to move out. This is the first time it’s ever reached this point, even through many other arguments in the past. I’ve been seeing all the signs for a while now, my brothers head is not in a good place. It’s breaking my heart. I don’t know what I can do because he’s so cut off from everyone even if we try to reach out. Maybe I’m not trying hard enough to reach out. That’s where I need you guys.

It feels like this feeling of dread and guilt follow me everywhere. I don’t know what this is, can anyone tell me what this could be?",29Mar2020,1
188,"So basically, I'm 18 and last year my very innocent very good best friend started working at a restaurant where she mentioned a creepy cook who made comments about her ass(this is when she was 17 still) she turned 18 in the summer and I moved away to Italy for a while while she stayed in our home city. I was very nervously video chatted by her and our other bestie one day in October where she told me she had been seeing this guy and he had taken her to a motel room to smoke weed but then he ended up taking her virginity. My brother had also worked with this guy and did not like him at all, he remembers him saying shit about her to him and he was like ""dude she's a kid"". Basically this guy is 30 or 31 now, has 3 children with 2 different women, has been to prison, and before they started dating, mentioned escorting to her on multiple occasions. When i found out about this i absolutely freaked out and screamed and cried at her. She didn't take this well and decided to lie to me and continue seeing him. I've been home for about a month and knew she was acting weird so I spoke to my other friend about it who reluctantly told me it had never stopped and they saw each other a few times a week at his place for sex and they did go out sometimes. When I spoke to her a few months ago, she told me she was ending it and downplayed what had happened, she doesn't know I know yet and doesn't want to tell. me because she thinks ill tell her mom. She also thinks I am the unstable one because I have had mental health issues in the past, so she's using them as reasoning for me being so insane about this.  I need help because she thinks this is ok, I believe this is going to be a disaster in the end. My problem now is my other friend says that I just have to be there for her because its all gonna come crashing down soon but I'm having a lot of trouble doing that. I don't know why but  I don't feel like I will be able to just go along pretending I think everything is ok when I feel like I could get a call one day saying that she's dead missing(might be a little dramatic) I don't know how to handle this it's making me insane because I am so disgusted and so against it. I just want to make her understand but I can't. If anyone has any advice please let me know. Also, am I just being crazy or is this really not normal??",29Mar2020,1
189,"A couple days ago I was seriously considering cutting my wrists and had been planning on doing it on that day for a couple weeks. Then I watched a good movie and played Minecraft with my friend and I decided not to do it. Ever since then I’ve been watching movies everyday and made a stupid plan that if I like them then I decide I want to live another day and if i don’t then, you know. I find this so stupid and I’m genuinely embarrassed to post this but I needed to vent and know if I’m the only one who does this. I don’t know whether I’m too scared to do anything and that’s why I’ve been watching movies, like ones that were my favorites and I know I like or about a topic I enjoy. I don’t know if I’m going stir crazy or something else. I just want to know whether I really am alone in this weird situation or it’s something else.

They all exist with the ugliest attitudes and its rubbing off on their 8 year old child who put hand sanitizer in my water and almost made me throw up.  But usually, I wouldn't get angry.  I'd probably cry about it or something but not be fuming and throwing shit because I'm so mad.  I don't know where any of this anger is coming from but I'm so done.

191,"Episode 41 of bamboo&amp;glass episode is called ""How Dance Saved His Life"" and shares the story of Matt Diep, a queer Vietnamese American dancer who founded a urban dance + mental health nonprofit called Psypher LA.

He shares his experience:

* growing up in a Catholic family, fearful that being queer makes him less ""masculine""
* turning to substances to participate in ""masculinity""
* finding a safe space for healing and self-expression through urban dance
* creating and running a nonprofit ([https://www.psypherla.org](https://www.psypherla.org/)) that leverages urban dance to engage Asian American youth in discussions about mental health.

A truly incredible story about the trap of toxic masculinity and how urban dance was LITERALLY a life-saving avenue for self-expression and solidarity.

193,"I write when I’m depressed, or having a mental breakdown. So here are some of the things that i wrote. Btw all of this in the notes app titled “things to tell my therapist”


Saturday, January 25, 11:07 PM 2020

I’ve had this feeling of dread deep down in my chest since I could remember. It grows with each passing day, I feel like it’s killing me from the inside out. I feel like my organs are rotting within me. I can’t sleep because I can’t stop thinking about it. I don’t know what it is, it’s just a feeling, like there’s this heavy thing on my chest all the time. I’m in pain even if it doesn’t seem like it, and I try to hide it with laughter. I’m trying to get better, but every time it seems like I’m making progress I fall.

Ps, pizza rolls are fire bro


Wednesday, February 5, 12:09 AM

I saw this thing on tv where this girl was talking about her feelings. she was talking about how everything that used to matter to her don’t matter to her anymore, And I started crying, she like perfectly explained the way I feel. The things I used to love do not matter to me anymore, and I find it hard for me to care for anything, and it makes me feel bad. Like I’m a terrible person for it. Everything just feels like it hurts but like in a way I can’t feel it. Like all my emotions are dull and I can no longer feel them like the way I used to. I’m like distant from myself like I don’t know who I am anymore, and I guess that hurts a lot.


Depressed

My brother came up into my moms room, that I’m sleeping in at the time and jumped into bed, and fell asleep, and he like took up the entire bed and I can’t sleep in there now.  that made me really depressed, like it’s unfair, and I told him to get out but he wouldn’t. I have to sleep in my sisters room now but I don’t like it in here, and it’s hard for me to sleep without a tv on to block the noise of silence out. I’ve cried. I know it’s a small thing but it upsets me because this has happened before, a lot when I was a kid. Theres been a lot of times when I had nowhere to sleep, and it just seems unfair to me because my bed was just taken away from me. it hurts a lot for some reason. I just want to rest and lie down for a while and sleep, but I can’t because someone else is sleeping in my bed. That’s kind of a symbolism for my entire life. Someone taking what they want from me, and never giving back, and it hurts a lot. Like so much has been stolen from me, and it’s all just really unfair. It makes me so sad, I’ve done nothing to deserve all of this, I’m still just a some girl, and I just wanna be free from a lot of this. I wish I could be normal and have friends and go places, but my ability to be normal feels like it’s been stolen from me. I feel like it’s partially my fault for not speaking up, and telling people how I feel when they’re doing it to me. My heart hurts.


Scared

I’m really fucking scared, and not in the way that I find fascinating and fun, in the way where it terrifies me. I’m scared that I’m like my parents, like I’m a lazy unfeeling and unstable person. And I don’t know if I’m even feeling these things. I’m confused, and I don’t want to have things wrong with me. I’m scared that I’m sick in the head and I’m going to do something really stupid, like hurt someone someday. I don’t want to hurt anyone, and I’m scared that I’m like my dad. My dad is someone to get a kick out of hurting someone. I’m terrified of growing up and becoming someone like him. I want to be successful, and work, and make art. And I’m the only person standing in the way of doing that. But sometimes I feel so dull and emotionless, I don’t care when I should care. It hurts, I feel like there’s something seriously wrong with me, and it may be my fault. And I have no excuse for it. When I tell someone that I’m not close to “I love you” I feel like I’m lying to them, because I should love them. But I don’t, And it makes me feel so self centered. I feel guilty because I SHOULD feel more connected to others, but I I’m not. I’m not even connected to myself. My mind is always racing. And I know I feel things, and I have emotions, and I feel them strongly at times, but sometimes I don’t feel them at all. Should I?



OKAY IM SORRY FOR THE BAD GRAMMAR, but I really wanted to share this in case anyone else is going through the same thing. If so you’re not alone because I’m just as dull and unfeeling as you are my friend.",29Mar2020,2
194,"I've recently picked up interest in understanding dissociative identity disorder. To preface, it's just a subject that I'd like to learn more, not looking to diagnose.

The first time I deep dived into reading and watching content about it, I experienced some weird symptoms later on at night? I don't know what's the right name for it.

It felt like someone detached me from a physical conversation I was having at that time. I also found it really hard to build thoughts and reply. It's like a plugged pulled from my mind. It blanked out and I was miles away. It took me a while to recover but I was fine after that, just a bit shaken and jumbled. I felt so weird after that because the only time I 'blanked out' was once many years ago in a stress induced situation. There wasn't stress that night, I was relaxed and chatting.

I took a break from reading DID related content and tonight I went back into it again unknowingly. My mind felt like disconnecting from the world again and it took some effort to keep it focused on what I'm doing instead of letting it space out again.

For some bg context, I've never been professionally diagnosed at all, just have the rare panic attacks and some anxiety. 

Don't know what to feel about this. I'm really confused as to whats causing this trigger. Is it some mirroring neurons firing off? It's baffled me and I'm hoping someone can help me make sense of it.

TL;DR Reading up on DID triggers some weird blanking out experience for me. Only mental health issue I suffer from are panic attacks and mild anxiety. I don't understand what's going on.",29Mar2020,2
195,"Lately I am feeling hopelessness. Five years ago I was on top of the world. Happy relationships, good income, security. Slowly that all unravelled (no, no drug or addiction issues or anything like that). My relationships are broken, my job sucks, the area I am in is going to be looking at 25-30% unemployment for years. The world is just starting a depression that hasn't been seen since the 30's. I am feeling like I just want to pack up and move to a dessert island. Every time I think I am making a little progress forward something else even bigger knocks me back (a pandemic? Really?! The universe is really pulling out all the stops now). I don't remember ever a time in my life where I saw the future as this dark.",29Mar2020,2
196,"I've noticed for a couple months now that my mood shifts a lot. It didn't used to in the past, but now it is. I'll be super gloomy and ""distant"" one morning, be all laughs and smiles during the day, and then feel like crying myself to sleep at night (but I can never actually cry). Just last night, my eyes kept burning as though I was going to cry, but it never came out. Or sometimes I'll have a really good and productive day, but the next day I don't want to see anybody or do anything and I'll just lie there.


Recently, I've also been dealing with what I believe is anxiety, according to my friends. One day, throughout the day, I kept getting these nerves. Like when you're about to give a presentation, or the butterflies in your stomach when talking to a crush. But I was just sitting at home as I always do. I kept thinking something was off, and my mind was just going wherever it wanted. The next day, I could barely smile. I drove to work and didn't even remember the drive, as I just dissociated. Everyone at work noticed I was different. It happened again a couple days ago. So my family believes this is my anxiety manifesting (I'm 20, and it runs in my family), but it feels like something... more. Something worse.

But I have no idea where to go or what to do. I know I need help, but the only doctor I've been to in the last 10 years is an urgent care when I was sick. I know nothing of doctors and clinics. 

Where do I go? Who do I talk to?

It might sound stupid, but I want a diagnosis if there is one. I want to know exactly what it is so that I can do what I need to do to deal with it.",29Mar2020,1

198,"I'm a 16 year old girl and made this account so no one figures out who I am. I'm looking for help.

I've been thinking about it lately and I've been noticing some weird behaviors in myself, that weren't there before. I just watched a youtube video about trauma and found some weird similarities. 
Before talking about these behaviors, I should talk about what I think traumatized me, IF I am even traumatized.
People have tried to break into my house about 6 times over about 5 years (I say about, bc the events are foggy in my mind). This has completely shattered my sense of security and I don't feel safe anywhere. I live with my little sister and mom. I know that if someone manages to get in, I will be the only one who can protect my family.

So now I'll list some weird things that I've noticed in myself:
• seeing these events and possible outcomes in my dreams often
• sleep paralysis and repeated false awakenings (nested dreams I think)
• overall nightmares
• really realistic dreams and getting confused about what has and hasn't actually happened
• not remembering when and what exactly happened during these attempted break ins, overall the experiences are really foggy
• thinking of ways to protect myself the next time this happens
• hiding weapons around the house
• mood swings
• feeling really tired
• feeling unsafe everywhere
• this really uncomfortable feeling of danger randomly
• carrying a knife with me everywhere I go
• crying for no reason (not as common)
• forgetting events that have happened
• getting easily startled by signs that hint at someone trying to break in (outside lights turning on, dogs making noise, overall sounds, ect)

I'm sure I'm forgetting something, but these are some of the things that I've experienced.
At this point it's not a question of IF someone breaks in, it's a question of WHEN, I am completely convinced in that. The dreams of these break ins have gradually gotten worse and now, I'm convinced that I will be able to kill the next person who tries, to just feel safe again. I don't think I want to kill someone, but I really don't know anymore. I'm not a psychopath, I feel compassion, but that feeling has also gotten weaker recently.

I was diagnosed with depression about 2 years ago, but have been better since December. I'm finally happy again after so, so long, but now these problems have come into my life. I'm still seeing my therapist once a month and stopped self harming a year ago.
I don't really want to talk to my therapist about this, bc I think I'm just overreacting. And with quarantine I can finally focus on my hobbies, so being put into the hospital again would really suck. But I know that if something is wrong, then just pretending it doesn't exist will only make things worse. But the problem is that I don't know if something is wrong.

So what do you guys think? Am I overreacting, or is something wrong? I just really need some closure and thought people here would know better

Edit: I'm not a native english speaker, so sorry if I got some terms wrong",29Mar2020,3
199,"After looking for the right subreddit to post this in, I think I might be right here? 

Anyway

Being in quarantine and having to work from home gave me the time to question myself and my behaviour (more so than ever) and I've found something rather strange.

There is no middleground in my life EVER. I am either completely obsessed or apathetic towards something or someone. 

I can read a whole set of books in a matter of days but won't touch another one for months. 

I bombard people with messages one day and ghost the same people the next day. 

I either work out so much I hurt myself or throw up or I slum it on the sofa and don't even move the whole day. 

Is anyone else like this? I feel this isn't particularly healthy nor normal because I can't seem to keep (any) relationships alive bc I either smother people or I don't give a fuck

TL;DR: there's never a middleground with me, I either go in and give 150% or I don't care at all",29Mar2020,1
200,"This story is a bit disgusting.

I'll just get straight to it. There is a sock I ejaculated into in one of my drawers in my room and it has been there for years. I developed germophobia a few years ago and have avoided opening it because I don't want to touch anything that the sock has touched in that drawer and I don't want the dust that has touched the sock to come out. Well my germophobia has come back recently and I realised my parents had been opening and closing that drawer for years (don't worry they didn't touch the sock, they just throw socks and underwear in there and close it without putting their hands in the drawer) and now I'm afraid to go in my room, touch anything that my parents have touched around the house (because they might have put their hands in the drawer while placing clothing in there and their hand might of touched the sock), and I think the dust has exited the drawer and gone all over my room and around the house so I can't touch anything in the house without washing my hands after and keeping my hands in my pockets, I feel like the dry cum flakes and dust are everywhere basically even on my clothes and in my gaming PC where the fans take air in and there is dust under my keyboard and literally everything in this house disgusts me now.

Now I'm posting this here because I'm going insane in this house and it's destroying my life and I can't go to therapy because I need scientific answers to satisfy me. Is there any scientific answers to help me stop my fear of this? I feel trapped in my life and can't escape.

Sorry if this sounds stupid but this is destroying my life.",29Mar2020,2
201,"Ever since I was a young kid I can remember always feeling like I’m being watched. 

As a child I remember being convinced someone was somehow watching me through the mirror with a camera or something. 

Growing up I would always wonder if someone’s watching what I’m doing at that time (these thoughts came in the form of ghosts watching me, people from school stalking me, etc). This paranoia never seemed to leave, although it did reduce at one point. 

As I got into my late teens, the feeling of being watched turned a little scarier and I would be paranoid about being watched in the house. I would be terrified to be home alone and would lock myself in my room out of fear that someone would break in and assault me or kill me.

As of late, it’s starting to affect my sleep. I haven’t been able to sleep in my room alone and will often move to my parents or brothers room after hours of not being able to sleep out of fear. It’s kind of embarrassing &amp; it makes me feel a little crazy vocalizing this here since I’ve never really openly talked about it before. 

I don’t want to talk to my psychiatrist about this because I’m embarrassed and don’t want her to think I’ve absolutely lost it. I do have some trauma in my past which may have made this worse, but it has definitely been happening since I was quite young. 

Has anybody else ever experienced this and do you have any helpful tips to overcome this irrational fear and paranoia?",29Mar2020,1

My parents always want me to have a ""good life"" and always guilt trip me into doing what they want me to do. I have developed anorexia and bulimia multiple times(and have gotten rid of it with help from friends) which has damaged me physically. Though I do not want to disappoint anyone, I kind of have the feeling that I am going to go insane or even go as far as attempting suicide for the fourth time.

Similarly, if I catch my teeth on a glass when I’m having a drink, I have to do it again. Otherwise I get a really uncomfortable feeling in my teeth.

205,"Hey y’all, I’m wondering if anyone has tips for this. I had a really shitty 8 days prompted by having to shut in for coronavirus. I was basically doing nothing the entire time, I was in the metaphorical fetal position the entire time. Was able to eat and exercise, but not much else. 

I’ve got my days down to a reasonable schedule now and I’ve pulled myself out of it, but during that time I hardcore ghosted a client (I do some graphic design freelance work as a student, am new to the business etiquette side of things). I didn’t miss a deadline, but I should have had work delivered really on the first day of the episode. It’s like a one to two hour amount of work; I’m finishing it now.

But I have no idea how to email my client once I’ve finished it. “Hey, sorry for not existing for 8 days even though you know I have literally nothing to do” doesn’t seem to work. I don’t really think it’s professional to disclose mental health issues in the setting, and I don’t really want to anyway, but I also don’t consider myself a liar and I hate making excuses, so I really don’t know how to approach it.

206,"I live with my parents and as much as I love them and appreciate everything they do for me, I can’t fucking stand being in this house with them any longer. And this quarantine is unlikely to end any time soon. 

Lately everyone is getting on everybody’s nerves. My dad and I haven’t been speaking for over a month now due to a small falling out and my mom is now getting upset with me over it even though he was in the wrong. I told myself I wouldn’t give in until it began affecting my own piece of mind. It hasn’t, but it’s bothering me how everyone sees fault in my actions when they are the adults and should be setting the example. Now we are all barely speaking.

This mostly stems from cultural reasons too. South asian parents never see fault in their actions. But before I would be busy with school/be out of the house often and we would forget about it. Now we constantly see each other and it’s driving me insane. Like I can’t get away from anything and breathe.

Now I’m seriously contemplating getting a good job and moving out at some point this year. It sounds unrealistic to happen that fast but I really want to become fully independent and leave.

212,"First I want to say that what i am about to say happend a long time ago. I still from time to time remember it. I tried forgetting it or pretended to make something of it that isnt the truth. 

When I was around 10 years old a cousin of mine (girl) watched me and my sister when my mom was not home. I am a child of divorce and I have seen lots of abuse and violence in my younger years. On a particular night my little sister was already asleep. My cousin thought it would be funny to play a game. She would like me to undress myself and she would do that to. Then i have to lay on the couch while she jumps naked on me (in a sitting position). I realise now that she was using me for sexual pleasure. This happend 3 times and then it kinda stopped after I said that I dont feel comfortable and that I will tell mom id she doesnt stop. It was really weird, almost as if it didnt happen. I was ashamed and felt very dirty about it. I never told my mom or anyone. 

I feel that that experience ruined my innocence very early on. I wish it never happend. Today I am 17 years old and I have such a problem with creating normal relations with people. Boys literally scare me and I dont like love in any way. Eventhough I have desires and all that I still cant even bring myself to hold hands with someone. I dont know if its the divorce of my parents or the experience with my niece that resulted in me being the way I am. I hope someone has some type of advise. My cousin is now 25 or something like that she is married and has child.

213,"A while ago, someone mentioned 5-HTP, and l-theanine when I was talking about my mental health, but when I asked when they were I didn't get a response.

I've tried looking them up, but I am just confused. I've read both good and bad things about them, so I am unsure if it is safe or not, can any one speak on them? Or if they aren't good, are there any other recommendations?

 There are family issues where my parents don't want me going on anti-depressants so I can't bring it up to my doctor to get prescribed for them, so I am wondering if there are any that do somewhat of the same thing that I can buy over the counter",29Mar2020,2
215,"The title explains it all. My first ever childhood memory was watching high school musical and thinking how much I wanted to have gabriella's body since I was a fat kid. Ever since that, I've binged and purged up until I was 17. I am now 20. Tonight, my roommates and I (we've been quarantined together) decided to get drinks and food and hang out together. I made up an excuse to go to my room a few floors ups because ""I felt sick"" and ended up purging all the food and drinks I ordered. I felt really good, so I kept binging and purging for the next 2 hours. I feel disgusted with myself but I can't tell my friends or anyone in my family because no one knows. I feel lost and close to relapsing again. I don't know what to do. I  cannot post anything to any of the eating disorder subreddits for someone reason so this is the closest place I could.

216,"I’m struggling. A lot. In a million areas of my life right now.

I’m quarantined to my apartment with my ex who dumped me a month ago and who has already moved on to dating her old, toxic ex girlfriend again. My ex gave me no reason for the breakup and doesn’t know that I know she went back to her ex girlfriend.

I can go to work because I am an essential behavioral health employee, but I’m isolated in my office at work and I absolutely hate my job at this point. I can’t see friends because of social distancing. I’m confined to my apartment and I have to deal with my ex being happy and moved on from me every single day. It really hurts because I love her and she lead me to believe that I was the one for her, and then she dumped me and ran back to her ex. I feel like garbage. She doesn’t even appear to care about the breakup and never did, for someone who claimed to have loved me more than anything for over a year.

I’m planning on moving out of town in a month, but I don’t know how to deal until then. I’m so fucking depressed I can’t stand it. I don’t want to hurt myself, but if something happened and I died I think I would be at peace with it all. I’m just in so much pain with nowhere to run to.

I’m on antidepressants, see a therapist, exercise, meditate, eat well, drink water, all of it. But this unshakable loneliness and feeling of worthlessness just does not go away. I just want to be able to move on. I want to be able to move past this. I hate feeling so useless and in pain.",29Mar2020,1

219,"I'm considering making a complaint against the NHS mental health services in my university city.

I feel let down and like something went seriously wrong.

In december I attempted suicide. In January I got the GP to refer me to the mental health service which from my understanding acts as an initial triage type thing before referring/sending you off to the appropriate therapy. Fast forward until about few weeks ago and I had still heard nothing. My GP, First Response staff (111) and a psychiatrist person from A&amp;E all chased up my referral multiple times also updating them on my situation (I was getting worse).

One day when I was especially upset I managed to find an email address which was for sending the service feedback. I shouldn't have used it but it was my only method of communication and I was upset so I explained my situation and that I didn't know if I could keep myself safe. I got a reply to the email saying that they had received my referral in january but it had been ""overlooked"". They said they would call me the next day. The next day they called me whilst I was busy and so the woman on the phone agreed to call me back in an hour. They did not call me back in an hour, or two, it's been weeks and they have not called me back.

So why do I want to make a complaint? Because I feel I was such a serious case having attempted, increasingly self harmed, presented multiple times at A&amp;E, admitted I didn't think I could keep myself safe, had an ambulance sent to me after almost attempting again and they didn't so much as send a letter, email or phone call to notify my existence as they somehow ""overlooked"" it. And then when they did contact me it was kind of pitiful.

I understand the NHS is stretched especially the mental health services but it just feels like it went too far this time. I'm back home from uni now (in a different county) and made a referral to my local mental health services and they sent me an email and text message (within hours) notifying me of a phone call appointment in a week.

But at the same time I don't know if I should make a complaint.",29Mar2020,1
220,"My sister started eating less and we took her to the hospital in time so her organs are all fine. After 4 or so weeks in hospital she is back home and every 4 to 5 days she has a breakdown. She thinks that she didnt get a good treatment in the hospital (which I somewhat agree.. there was no specialized care they just had a menu that she would eat) and she is saying things that it is to late and that now they just let her be. 

I think she has depression as well. She doesn't have it on paper but I think she has something of that sort. Today was one of the breakdowns and after laying for half a day she started crying later at night and saying she wants to go out. She is not telling us where. She is not dressed to go out. She got to the door and was crying there on the floor while my dad wasn't letting her go. 
She was saying things like I don't want to wake up here anymore and I don't want to live anymore. Its not fair... and so on.

I don't understand this behaviour and I don't know what we should do. We are still in contact with the doctors over email but i dont feel like there is profesional help that is obviously needed.

Any advice about this would be helpful.",29Mar2020,2
221,"I am a 20 year old, I live in the middle of the Indian Ocean.

I feel very anger at everyone and everything. I hate most people even my own family. I feel like I have been treated unfairly my entire life. After all the pain and suffering, I finally found something worth holding onto and now my job is being taking away from me. I can understand the circumstance, the entire world is going to shit but I just can’t stop myself from having these feelings.

I have always suffered from a mental illness, whether it be loneliness, PTSD (from my fathers suicide), never reaching an goal/expectation of my mother. I have always dealt with it all by myself. I have always being able to keep myself in check. But somehow it’s overwhelming me now.

I think it the frustrations from my love life, I have never had any success there, all my life I have been told to be fun, kind, honest, caring, helpful and friendly person. People will love and cherish you, but now being honest is wrong, tell people what they want and treat people differently. There is no need to be nice to everyone, just to the select few. I don’t know what the fuck to do anymore. I have tired fucking everything and all anyone sees is a friend who is reliable and will help, they only talk when they need something. Nobody really care about me. I feel like I don’t wanna continue living on like this, I don’t wanna fight myself anymore. I think I should let the demons take over and let them destroy everything.

224,"Hi everyone. This is my first time posting on here so I'm a little nervous but I'm gonna give it a whirl. For reference, I'm diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and OCD.
So the earliest I can remember feeling like this was in I want to say second grade. I remember sitting in art class and asking my friends if they feel like they are actually there or we are in a dream, because I felt like I was just dreaming, not actually there. 
Most days, at least at some point in the day but many times for a long period in the day, I feel like I am in a dream and things around me are not real. Last night I went outside in the rain with my father and it was even worse. 
Does anybody know what's going on?",29Mar2020,2
225,"I've never felt normal tbh but it has rarely ever been an issue, i just know i have to deal with things other people doesn't and that's it. The thing is, sometimes i feel like a psychopat and sometimes like some lifeloving hippie. What i mean with this is, I respect people and animals and life and sometimes i dream about the world being a better place, y'know those daydreams like oh i become a millionare and i help my community and we are super chill and kids go to school and grown folks learn how to have a vegetable garden and shit like that. Like fuck capitalism let's all help each other yadah yadah.
But some other times i think about how i could get away with murder, and i plan it in my head to detail, like a lot of times or how to hurt people. And tbh i thought it was common, maybe not normal, but common. Until a few times i have let some thingd slip out and suddenly my friends are staring me like dude ??
Also I have a big problem in connecting with my emotions and feelings and i know how to lie and manipulate even thought i try not to do it, it's always in the back of my head, and even thought i feel some kind of pride when i do manipulate someone i also feel like the biggest asshole on earth. I have problems with my empathy like my friends or family cry or are sick or angry and i just don't care.
Whenever i'm seeing someone romanticly i always find myself speaking of them as i was superior and them superficial and dumb, and it doesn't help that most of the time they do dumb shit and my friends agree with me. Cause c'mon the people I date are human too and have emotion and feelings and I want them to like me and shit but i alwats end up thinking about them as ""oh yeah that asshole i'm seeing"" and i feel no connection (romantic or sexual to them) 
I feel a disconnection even to my own body, i see it in some kind of superficial way idk. 
All of this mixed feelings also happened to me as a child, i used to find pleasure in hurting smaller kinds than me, it never went overboard like i think i would tell them they couldn't play with us until they cried and man i felt so good when they cried and it's so fucked up.
I also used to choke my pets (specially when they made me angry) but stopped before even hurting them bc i knew they were alive and where going to feel pain, i also used to grab my baby cousin's leg and squish (?) it until he woke up or made noises, again, i would let go before hurting him (he was a baby and i was 11 maybe) 
So it feels like some kind of battle in which i wanna hurt people or do fucked up things vs me wanting to be kind a grow a fucking garden and adopt children and stuff
And i'm confused, is there something wrong with me? Is this what being human is? 
(besides the bad things i've done i'm also a ""good person"" like i'm that girl who takes a 3 hour bus ride to give you back your wallet that you lost, or gives my lunch to a homeless women, or protests for someones murder and rights, like i'm always up to help whoever who asks me to i have no issue to do things for people even if i don't know them and i go to quite the lenghts to do so, cause it does bring me pleasure to make people happy)
so ??

TL;DR: I like doing good things but i've also done things that could be considered ""psychopat like"" specially as a child, is there something wrong with me or am i just a little too rough sometimes?

226,"I am a 16yr old who is going on 17 next month

So I wanted to at least tell somebody about this and realized I don't have anyone to tell so I'm asking and saying it here. So recently I was having difficulties with a job and was given  a test to see if i was good Enough, I wanted to ace it but after failing Miserably I was given the results. The guy told me straightforward that I didn't do well at all just in some areas. So while telling me this I felt like I was listening but it just wasn't reaching my brain, it was like I was not taking in most of the information. So I had trouble answering the questions that was very simple for most people. After that I started to Realize that I had some difficulties understanding certain things even if they are simple. I looked back in my life to find that I was having this issue all along for years and it just made me feel like I was stupid very stupid. And it would explain why I was having such a hard time in school. I wasn't able to process things that any others can. I'm failing all my classes and its wrecking my life. I did tutoring and it didn't help. 

After that I searched for solutions to solve this because at the time I thought it was just something that can be fixed. So I searched and did the things that were suppose to help me but nothing worked, nothing was helping. So I searched what could be the problem and found a woman who was having the same problems as me. She was slurring her words, can't remember basic information, always done the opposite of what others tell her to do, and having to repeat others because she was having problems blocking them out when they were telling her things. All that stuff sounded the same as what I was going through. I was having the same problems this woman had and I didn't know if it was true. The only people I can talk to are my grandma and my mom. But after trying to bring it to light, my mom quickly dismissed it as something that ""I thought I had"". I didn't want to say anything because she already had a whole lot going on in her life, she even had to bury my dead brother who only lived for 3 days after birth because he didn't have a brain. Right now I'm the only child she has by her side. My siblings are something else. 

I want to tell me grandma but I know things are just gonna go downhill, so I'm stuck with no answers whatsoever and no one to talk to. I don't even have any friends because of my social skills and my family. But thats not what I came here to talk about.

It’s not always about my BF, it could be about my parents, or about my roommate or any other situation. 

Some googling came up with the term “emotional self harm” but I can’t find much else that supports this, besides an article simply calling it that by suggesting that you’re inflicting mental pain to yourself.

A few nights ago I was with a friend and I felt that familiar feeling of being ""spaced out"". It started to become pretty overwhelming so I ended up going home and went to bed. The next day I felt more or less ""normal"".

Today, I woke up more or less normal also. About 5 min before I left for my class it hit me again, but it was even worse this time. I feel like i'm watching myself (which hasn't happened in a while) I can barely think and when I can the coherent thought becomes quite jumbled at the end, the kind of incoherence you might hear from someone sleeptalking, think ""oh yeah I have to make sure I do that - and then go jump off a balcony"", or (related to my class) ""Some children have trouble learning when they have - the sky is falling"", just really strange stuff. A lot of it is me telling myself i'm going to die though, or it's even sexual. I'm writing this post because I keep thinking that i'm going to die today, like the lecturer is talking, her words don't sound real and i'm not taking it in, my brain just keeps tacking on comments at the end of her sentences like ""okay, but don't move or you're gonna die, you're gonna die anyway though"", or ""if you keep listening someone's gonna rape you again"" (i'm sorry if this is too graphic). I'm not hallucinating it, its just thoughts. The hard part is no one is noticing because it's purely internal and i'm just on autopilot anyway, for everyone else here, i'm completely normal. 

I don't have schizophrenia either. i'm just scared and i'm convincing myself of these things because i'm not mentally strong enough to stop it right now. I feel pretty trapped. I would appreciate any advice or anyone willing to comment. Sorry this is so long, it's difficult to get my thoughts out.",29Mar2020,1
