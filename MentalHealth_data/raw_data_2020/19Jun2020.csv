0,"So basically the title explains it. I was always protective towards my stuff, and i never shared any of the things i most cared of with others. Not even with my little brother, we never really shared anything. Like, i am mainly talking about my computer, which is one of the most expensive things i can ever own and i care a lot about it. I basically live  with it: i study, i practice my hobbies (like i am recently learning 3D art thanks to the time the quarantine gave me) , and you got the idea. and i will never, NEVER, let anyone touch it. I share my room with my brother, and when i am not at home i always get a little anxious because i can never fully trust him. He doesn't really care about his and other's stuff, and he often broke everything he had and i fear that he will do the same with my PC, even if he is not allowed to touch it. I might sound stupid i know, but this is really driving me a little anxious. What should i do?",19Jun2020,1
1,"is it the same elsewhere, 

here in Algeria, as soon as they notice a schizophrenic person, they hypnotize him to want to have sex with his sisters.

my uncle who is schizo have it, I am schizo and I have it and I know a brother of someone has it as well, they all reported they can't leave them with their sisters around.

I thought it was schizophrenia thing, but I searched all around, there is no such thing in the schizophrenia trouble.

and I searched people who they really like their sisters, I found it happens in teen years, not my case or the case of my uncle, my uncle showed the schizophrenia symptoms in late 20's and he was already married and have kids, just after his fall, my family reported he likes my aunts, and I don't remember at all I have any attraction to my sisters when I was a kid or a teen.",19Jun2020,1

5,"So idk if this is the best place to put it but i feel safer to put it here for some reason. Now i dont have alot of friends and there r only 5 people prolly whom i have completely opened up to about my depression and anxiety and past. 
I recently had a weird heart to heart on call who over whelmed me by telling me how close we are and stuff. NOW DONT GET ME WRONG, i like her and i am ready to support her and any of my friends when they go through stuff which is why ppl usually come to me but this gurl kinda made me open up even tho i didnt want to. Idk why i did and im not blaming her at all. But yah i dont really feel as connected to her as she does with me. This does make me feel like an asshole but yah :((
After opening up to her my brain keeps thinking of the past because if out the 5 other ppl i opened up to only 2 of them are still in my life, the others just turned out to be fakes... which is why i never open up to people. I just have trust issues with people i guess.
I am definitely overreacting and being weird about it but ig i cant do anything. I just had to let it out... coz i wish i could take it back u know. Now i feel like weird and cant properly converse with her about stuff. I wish i was more normal idk how people open up so easily :(

6,"I don’t have a close relationship with family members. When I was younger I was always subjected to the insults and not feeling wanted, which has sort of shaped me now as I feel not good enough. They also don’t care much about where I’m going with my life and don’t give me any support. We’re are a very poor family and I feel like people are getting easy rides into their future and I have to do everything myself.

This year has really not helped me much, the only ambitions I know I want to achieve it to travel ( I know not original), but I’m not going to be able to do that now with no money from no jobs going and travel bans, and then I’ll be going to University. Well I hope I do go, but I’m scared of the financial implications looming over me for a long time and the possibility of the whole thing being a waste, with the degree being useless. 

 Im lucky enough to have a reasonable amount of friends but talking to them will only lead to them using what I say as group jokes as that’s sort of the culture. ( Like everyone ‘banters’ and expect you to handle it but some times I’m not able to and feel hurt but I can’t show it)

I feel like all my friends are making strives in the right direction in their lives by forming relationships, working. And I feel like going to university is a huge risk on my future as I want to be far away from where I am currently to form a new path for myself. I only have a few connections with the other sex and would like to form a relationship as I would like to feel loved for once and to have a chance to show mine (sorry this sounds a bit corny). I just don’t know how I’m just too anxious to do anything, even though I’m very friendly with them.

My days currently are very repetitive and dull, I just think it’s making everything worse. The only shining light has been my dog and I cherish her for always making me happy but I don’t think it’s enough.

I feel like writing this has helped a bit to clear my mind, sorry if you do read this and there is errors. I would like to speak to people if they are in something similar maybe we could help each other I’m not sure. I might remove",19Jun2020,1

8,"Once upon a time there was a young man. He was poor and broken. The youngest in a broken family. The most damaged boy you could imagine. He met a girl. Who tore his heart out and laughed about it. But deep into the night she wept. For the boy did not get mad. He loved her. One night the girl laughed at him to further the act of betrayal( a common way of gaining what these low life scum call ""clout"") The boy was furious. For the first time he got angry at her. And gave her one last chance at forgiveness. She refused and the boy left. He ingnored her constant attempts to make him love her again. The boy held strong. Until one day the boy looked into another girl's eyes and felt nothing. He looked back and realized he had lost it all too that night.

9,"I’m so depressed by hearing all the experiences people had in their childhood and teenage years.

I was homeschooled from a really young age, and my parents were extremely protective. The only source of communication I ever had was through online games. So I’ve never been out with friends before, never communicated with anyone in person. It really messed me up in many different ways. 

I’m now 19, recently Graduated from high school(still homeschooled). I thought after Graduating, I could get a job and meet people. But then Covid came around. 

And it has surprised me how badly this whole social distancing has affected peoples mental health, because I always though I was just a big baby over it. My life has been like this since about 4th grade.

And I’m finally gonna be able to get a job soon because my town is opening up, and I need to aquire my drivers license first. 

But now I don’t know how I’m gonna even do the job interviews. I’m so awkward, and bad at socializing in general. 

I literally feel mentally disabled or something because I don’t know how to hold a simple conversation , how to act in front of everyone, or handle little social situations.

My mother has been depressed since she got abruptly fired from her job recently for no good reason (her boss is heartless as hell!), and a few years ago our dad passed away due to cancer which majorly affected us emotionally. 
Currently, I live away from my mother and work in a different place; but since my mother has been depressed to the degree that she doesn’t feel like eating anything, cries almost every morning, has sleeping issues etc, should I take some time off of my work and stay with her for a while?

12,"I've only seen this therapist twice. After the 2nd session it was clear to me it wouldn't work. Her style feels very prescriptive and activity based (ie draw a picture) vs what I would prefer which is to have time to talk and process my feelings {feel understood} around a traumatic situation. We've only talked twice and she's already assigning me homework to help me feel ""empowered"" when I don't actually feel disempowered. She's not listening deeply, but more waiting for an opportunity to perform her knowledge in any way even if it's not applicable.

I'm an adult. I know I can just call and have the difficult moment of saying, ""We're not a good match."" and then move on, but how do I go about finding a good match so I don't have to keep breaking up with therapists?",19Jun2020,1

14,"i don’t understand what’s wrong with me. for as long as i can remember, i’ve been obsessed with how i look. i take hours to get ready before i go anywhere, and though my parents don’t say it, i know they think i’m vain and shallow. they tell me to not focus so much on how i look, that others don’t focus on your every flaw, but no matter how much i tell myself this, i still find myself looking in the mirror every chance i get. 

i’ve always felt like something was wrong with me. when i was ten i started wearing concealer because i had started getting acne, and i felt like i couldn’t go out anywhere without it being covered. this went on for five years until my acne finally died down. for five years, whenever i went for a sleepover, i’d wait until everyone was asleep to take my makeup off, and wake up extra early to apply it on again. i never went swimming with my friends in fear my makeup would come off, and had to endure people telling me everyday that i was wearing too much, or worse, whispering it behind my back. even when i went to germany to visit my grandparents, i always had to have layers of makeup on, or i’d freak out. i was so convinced everyone would notice and care if one pimple wasn’t covered, and i drove me to the point where i just didn’t want to go outside anymore.

this obsession has focused on numerous parts of my body. my acne had always been my main focus, but over the last couple of years its shifted back and forth between a handful of things. at the beginning of eighth grade it was my eyebrows. i was stupid and plucked them for the first time, resulting in my eyebrows being shorten by at least half of what they used to be. to try and fix them, my mother gave me one of those gel eyebrow brushers. i’d spend an hour if not more in the morning, brushing my eyebrows, trying not to get a hair out of place. it made me constantly late to school because i couldn’t leave my house without them being ‘perfect’, or at least what i thought was perfect. if i had to leave before they were, i’d have either a major panic attack that ended with me curled up in a ball on my bed, or a rage fit that resulted in my room being torn apart. even when i left to go to school, every hour i had to go to the bathroom and fix them again. it got to the point where i missed a whole class just trying to fix my eyebrows. 

by january, my eyebrows had grown back well enough, and i no longer needed the gel brusher. it wasn’t even two weeks before another thing caught my eye. i started noticing there was a small shadow on my nose, and no matter how many times i piled on makeup, it wouldn’t go away. soon the panic attacks and rage fits started again, and no matter how much i wanted to just walk away, i was always pulled back to the mirror. i started missing classes again, and even during them, all i could think about was how i looked and if anyone noticed the shadow on my nose. i started hiding my face behind my hair and hands, and though i know no one noticed nor cared about the shadow, i couldn’t stop myself from obsessing over it.

ninth grade was better, or at the beginning at least. my eyebrows grew back to normal, my acne was well under control, and i switches makeup brands and could no longer see the shadow. i was finally happy to go to school and for people to look at me, and i wasn’t spending that much time in front of the mirror anymore. that is, until my brain decided to tell me my nose was awful. throughout the years of my obsession, whenever something was finally going right and i was no longer focusing on a flaw, something inside of me would find something new to lose sleep over. 

to this day i still can’t look at myself without noticing how ugly my nose is. it didn’t bother me before, but now it’s all i can think about. it’s gotten to the point where i can’t watch tv without comparing myself to a character/actor and crying my eyes out. i’ve been considering a nose job for quite some time now, but i have no idea how to go about it.

do you think i should speak to someone? my mother suggested i go talk to someone about my problems a while back, but my dad thinks all teenagers go through this and i’m just being dramatic. he thinks i can just walk away if i really wanted to, but i don’t think i can. for a while i blamed my behaviour on my perfectionism, but now i don’t think this behaviour is normal. does anyone have any suggestions on what this is or if other people go through it? is this something i should be concerned with and talk to a professional about? i’ve never considered seeing someone before, mostly because i feel people have much worse problems than i do, so why should my silly problems matter, but everyday i feel like i’m slowing sinking and i don’t know what to do.",19Jun2020,1

17,"Talking to yourself without realizing it? I'm not delusional, I don't have hallucinations. Please, don't say something dumb like ""thinking"". We all know what thinking is. Don't be a retard.

I pretty much say whatever comes to mind without thinking about it or being aware of it. Please don't try to relate to this to something innocuous like day dreaming, *it's not.* I've literally been doing it since I was a child. It's not that I just repeat what I'm thinking. I appear to be in some highly suggestive state when it comes to the things I repeat. Once when I was 8, in a foster home my foster dad told me there was a bear sighted in town when we were camping in the back yard and that it was after me cause of my teddy bear. I don't fucking know *why* the dude said that, but... Either way, I forgot about it but got woken up in the middle of the night to my foster dad yelling about me ""not shutting up about the bear"". I was confused. I hadn't even been thinking about this bear. In fact, as far as I was aware, I was asleep. That's just one example. I've found alphabet soup I've written on my mom's phone that I have no recollection of typing. This one kid made fun of me when I was younger for doing the same thing on a computer without realizing it. Apparently he could see it and I can't. Like my mind blocks or fragments awareness. The closest I've been able to find is a functional neurological disorder or a subtype of Avoidant PD. I ran away from my home town and ignored everyone I know for 7 years. I'm probably gonna kill myself if I don't find an answer soon. I can't go to school. I can't get a job. I have to hold water in my mouth to go anywhere so that can't hear me babbling. I also go places without realizing it. It's not multiple personality disorder. Don't suggest lame ways to cope. Then you obviously shouldn't be on this post. This is rape. I feel so contaminated. There is no protective membrane between me and the unwanted taint of others' touch. Someone help me. But I don't think anyone has any answers. And yeah, I've gone to a fucking doctor. All I need is an answer. I can't take this anymore. I've become profoundly sick because of this. I have no privacy in my own head. My sanctity has been violated. People tried keeping it from me for years in an attempt to preserve my sanity. Which is odd because the few people I've mostly accidentally told have been completely dismissive towards me. Fuck em' all. I can't live life like this.",19Jun2020,1
18,"Forty year old male, suffered from anxiety and major depressive disorder for as long as I can remember. Both have gotten significantly worse over the years and I have been seeing a psychiatrist for the better part of a decade for both issues. None of the pile of meds I've been on have had any significant impact on either issue.

So, anyway, long story short I have a real problem with confrontation. I hate getting into it with people and will avoid conflict at all costs, or just sit there and take the ass chewing, whether it be at work or home, but it's really starting to take a toll on me at home. I won't go into the details right now but I never feel like I can speak my piece to my wife and have her take it seriously. We've had some things going on lately and while she asks my opinion, she just seems to brush it off as soon as it comes out of my mouth, and I have no idea how to respond back.

24,"So ill try my best to explain my story and how I got to this point in my life

I grew up with a narcissistic dad, everyday he would berate me over the smallest things. He would call me degrading names which caused me to have low self esteem which led to me having social anxiety.

One day he gave me the option to go to another country and study there I was 14 at the time. I said yes because education in that country is better and I wouldn't have to live with him anymore. While in the boarding school life was just hell for me. Because of my social anxiety it was hard for me to function there. Imagine living in a boarding school in a country where your family in 10000km away with social anxiety. It's hell. What's worse the country I was staying at the people were a bit racist against my race because my race is known to be low level people there and usually just caregivers. So I encountered a bit of bullying which didn't help my self esteem at all. And I think because of it school staff also hated me

Fast forward to the end of the school year, one day I woke up with double vision. My counselor took me to the hospital where they did an mri and there it was a brain tumor.

Since I was a minor they couldn't treat me without my parents with me so they flew in the next week. I thought maybe because of the situation my dad would be different, but I was wrong he was complaining all the time about how he had to stay here with me bla bla bla

The doctors gave us a diagnosis but we suspected it was wrong and the medicine could disfigured my body(high dose steroids for months). So we asked my school if we could get a second opinion but instead they just gave us an ultimatum. Take the meds or you'll get kicked out.

 I couldn't afford to get kicked out because healthcare where I'm originally from is very bad and I didnt have insurance there. So instead of getting second opinion there we asked if i could take a 1 month break and go back to my country to get a second opinion. She agreed but once I landed in my country they sent a letter that I was kicked out. 

I was devasted. That racist bitch played us. So we contacted the people above her and tried to explain that we had her permission. They agreed and decided to let me back in. We got our opinion there and they said it was most likely cancer. 

So we flew back with this information and gave it to the doctors but those self righteous racist fucks wouldn't listen. So I had no choice but to go back to school and take the medication. 

And then I just started getting deeper and deeper into hell. The medicine that they gave gane me a lot of general anxiety and I would have panic attacks frequently it also made my social anxiety worse i couldnt even go to the cafeteria to eat. It caused me to have extremely painful cramps that sometimes would wake me up at night and i would be in tears. It made me gain 20 kilos within 3 months which caused my body to have fat deposits all over and my face became round. Also the weight gain cause me to have stretch marks everywhere and I mean everywhere my abdomen, underarms, legs etc which just worsened my self esteem. 

While on this medication my symptoms just worsened. My vision was deteriorating greatly. I noticed I was thirsty all the time and peeing every hour. I would wake up at least 4 times a night to pee. I was extremely fatigued all the time.

I complained to my doctor about it but he just brushed it off as side effects of the medication. Then after 4 months I experienced bad abdominal pain and got my blood tested to see that my liver values were through the roof(normal is 100-300 I think mine was 3000).the medication was damaging my liver. My dad managed to convince them to do another biopsy and finally those fucks diagnosed my cancer. 

The medication I was on suppressed my immune system which made my tumor grow bigger faster which caused the deterioration of my symptoms. My vision deteriorated so bad its hard to see. I also developed Diabetes insipidus which was the explanation for my thirst and peeing. I also developed hypothyroidism. All of these were permanent and couldnt be fixed. 

Throughout my treatment they continued doing more mistakes which gladly my dad caught but instead of thanking him for catching it they would be bitter they were caught. During my first 2 rounds of chemo my school refused to take me in the school car which is used to take children to the hospital. So we had to take the bus for my chemo treatments which was hard because I would be very fatigued after every infusion and it was 1 infusion per day for 3 days per round.

Finaly for the last 2 rounds they decided to take me to the hospital. But they didn't use the school car they ordered a $450 dollar taxi to take me there. I think the reason for this is they wanted people in management to see that im an expensive student so they would kick me out. They also told us the cost because I think they were trying to guilt us. 

So when chemo was over it was time for radiation. We flew to the US to get my radiotherapy. While I'm here I'm noticing symptoms of Ptsd. I'm constantly having flashbacks of what happened and everytime it's very distressing. I would become agitated if someone mentiones about what happened there. 

What they did to me was torture. I wish all racist fucks burn in hell. I'm having suicidal thoughts everyday and I swear the moment I land back there I'm gonna kill myself",19Jun2020,1

32,"If you noticed by my last posts (if you actually seen them) that I am a 11 year old boy that doesn't have a real reason to live.

Now, my Dad, he has been noticeably getting more and more angry. Probably because I am so burnt out and emotionally numb that I can't even get homework completed, or just live a normal life. I lied to him saying that I did homework and did things good. Welp, if you knew me personally with my dumb luck, that I am really unlucky, from my Dad being a complete asshole to me because it has gotten to the point when I did one mistake, he would snap at me. But my older brother when he does something wrong, no repercussions! I talked to my brother that I might have bipolar disorder due to how quick I change moods in a snap of a finger. And, my brother literally laughed in my face and said ""you don't have it! You just act dramatically! "" 

I feel scared of what my Dad might do to me if I cause a problem next time. My mother can't be with me this week since my parents are divorced, I wish my mother was here right now. She doesn't get mad at me for dumb reasons. 

Any help is appreciated greatly.",19Jun2020,1
33,what should I do if I have a perfect life but still want to kill myself,19Jun2020,1
34,"I ask, because I feel this way. I’ve thought about killing myself, but have been too afraid to do so, and I don’t know why. I’m not afraid of death. It feels more like I’m just afraid of the pain. If it was a quick death that I didn’t have time to think about before it happened, I’d be fine. It feels like something is keeping me alive, almost like an experiment to see how long it takes for me to break.

I don’t know if that makes any sense at all, but I can’t think of anything else. I’m just curious. It’s like a god complex, only, I don’t feel invincible in the sense that I’m important or valuable. It’s not a narcissist thing. It just feels like I’m still here because my pain brings others joy.

Any ideas as to what this indicates, and what I should do to help it?",19Jun2020,1
35,"For as long as I can remember, I have had a very difficult time with change. I transferred high schools two weeks into a new school after weeks of severe depression and anxiety and endless unexplained crying. I quit numerous jobs in high school after a day or two because of feelings of being overwhelmed and out of sorts. The new environments felt too surreal and I felt like I was so lonely I couldn’t possibly do well at those places (stupid I know after day 1 on a job). In college, I usually had 2-3 days of intense crying sessions and difficulty functioning after moving from home to campus every fall. As an adult I have had similar disproportionate reactions to things big and small in my life - a divorce (I cut myself some slack there) but also things like my sister moving out of my house and quitting a job/starting a new job. 

It has gotten to the point that I just know I will struggle with any relatively big change and kind of brace myself for it. And frankly try to avoid them. It’s usually 2-3 days of lots of crying, holing up alone, worries that I’ll never be happy again and nothing will be the same. But then it starts to ease up and before I know it I’m feeling fine again.

I’m worried because these occurrences kind of haunt me - I’m embarrassed by many of them in the past and things I did during them, like quitting jobs etc. I’ve made irrational choices because of these intense feelings. And now I worry about making future changes in my life because I know what the upheaval may do to me. I’ve lived in my current house 7 years and sometimes the though of moving out is terrifying. I look at other people’s lives and see how they switch jobs or move houses with seemingly no issue and I’m envious and confused as to why it appears so easy and carefree. 

It’s almost like I feel a bit paralyzed in my current life now. I’ve read about adjustment disorder and feel like I may have this, but curious to know others thoughts and recommendations.",19Jun2020,1

38,"Long story short, my mom and step-dad have never agreed on some fundamental things, and after 6 years together, everything is falling apart. 

My mom has extreme anger issues. She sees a counselor but it's not all that effective. My stepsister [17] made a snotty comment about doing the dishes, and my mom heard from the other room and came storming in. My mom overreacted WAY too much, calling my step-sister a ""fucking little bitch"" and other things along those lines. She didn't say it directly to her but to her dad (who was also in the room). My mom's actions were wrong on so many levels, even though a lot of what she said was true. 

My step-sister is not very well behaved and does make a lot of bratty comments. She was raised differently than me in an environment where that was okay, but I was raised to be a lot more respectful so I understood how it was wrong. She was never really taught right from wrong, and her actions lead my mom to be very verbally abusive. 

My mom has never even come close to being physically abusive, even though she has admitted to me in private that she's had intrusive thoughts of hurting and killing my step-sister. I very sincerely doubt she would ever act on those thoughts.

She's been deeply depressed most of her life, and her crippling relationship with my step-dad (partially because of his daughter's behavior, partially because of his own flaws, partially because of her issues) has put her over the edge. The last few weeks she's seriously been considering moving out, and even went to look at some nearby houses for rent. The problem is that she's too emotionally dependent on my step-dad, and doesn't have many other people who care about her other than myself.

She was suicidal all through her childhood, teens, and 20s. When she met my biological dad and had me at 30, she became a lot healthier. Then my biological dad became an alcoholic and she had to leave him, eventually meeting my step-dad  who, for the first few years, took away the pain of losing a relationship with my bio dad. After her and my bio dad broke up, she became suicidal again, but we t to therapy and got on medication and never acted on it.

Today, after her and my step-dad fought for a few hours in the garage, comes in my room to talk to me and say goodnight (it was around 10 o'clock). She left my room but right before she left she turned around and said ""I just feel like killing myself"" and I said ""Should I call the police?"" and she said no, she'll be fine.

I know to call the police because I was suicidal a few years back and she had to call the police because I was about to commit suicide and I know the process of going to the hospital and staying there. After a week in the mental health ward I got a lot better, and I thought maybe she could do the same.

But I also know my stay in the hospital costed a lot of money, and she doesn't make very much money at all at her job.

Should I call someone or just go to sleep? I'm tired as fuck and I've had the longest day, but if this is serious I can't risk losing my mom.",19Jun2020,1
39,"Okay, so this is my second job after I quit my first job for a variety of reasons that all boil down to it being a miserable place to be. Everyone hated working there and it showed. I remember even having one guy walk out after maybe two months and not show up again. It was always that everyone, or at least almost everyone, was miserable all the time. In my new job, the environment is definitely more positive, but there is definitely crap going on (my manger had a nervous breakdown in the break room; another member of lower management quitting \[2 in a month, 3 in 6 months\]). The more I'm there, the more I see how much everyone is hurting. Is this just how it is? Are we destined to be miserable for the rest of our lives? I hate to be a downer, but I gotta know.

This causes me add on more stress/anxiety/anger, ruining my relationship, and lack of sleep.

I told her that a faithful woman prayed for her cancer to go away, and it did, only for it to come back a few months later, so it doesn’t work. Finding faith, praying, has never healed anyone. Finding my way with God will never change the fact I want to die everyday. Why can’t parents stop finding a way around their children’s mental health and just accept the fact their child suffers? Why must they always take a religious route than a medical route? Why must they always invalidate their child’s feelings and concerns? Fuck.",19Jun2020,1

Even in the very early signs of it she won’t have anything to do with treatment and will get mad/change the subject. In the past, family has always put in a court petition or drive her to the hospital. Last year we did both and the petition was denied and the hospital did nothing. Everywhere I call or even the police dept says nothing to be done unless she is immediate threat to herself or others. Here’s what I’ve explained: she is having delusions/hallucinations-thinking she saw my deceased father and heard our dog getting slaughtered in the woods (not true), she doesn’t tell people where she goes or who she sees not even me, spends money carelessly and doesn’t open bills, she drives very slow on main roads and she would pull over if she saw someone she knows, her cars front bumper is hanging off 2 inches and she can’t remember how she did it, she’s all scratched up she says from going through the forest. It’s bad. And she thinks my step dad is the devil (she’s had feelings in the past of leaving him) he’s a good guy but doesn’t make her happy.

I get this emotional spiral of 3 different emotions fazed into one complex emotion where I’m mad sad and terrified ALL at once...my face even shows it as my expression changes rapidly while I endure this, my mouth and eyebrows just spazz out of confusion.

48,"I have struggled with a lot of confidence and body image issues for as long as I can remember. It got really bad in my last few years of high-school. There was a lot of shit going on in my life at the time that no one should experience, let alone a kid and all at once. I needed to be able to control something as I felt my life wa spiralling out of control, so I turned go food and exercise. I found the only thing I had almost full control over was my food, I was already very active, but then I turned even more towards exercise as an excapeism. This was not a particularly good mix to say the least and I became very unhealthy very quickly.

When I went to college I got a lot more confidence and I actually felt happy for the first time in my life. I was doing so well, I became a personal trainer and I had so many new found hobbies and goals. But then quarantine came, I got stuck at home and all of these hobbies and my gym, wer taken away. I still had running but then I pushed myself too hard and got really bad shin splints. It was the last thing I had left, and I lost all control again.

I am fully aware that I am restricting and binging again but I can't stop it. And this time round I can't sleep at all, I don't have anything to do anymore to occupy my time and now I have just so much more of it. I spend it all thinking and it just makes it all so much worse. I got furloughed, I don't have college, and I don't have sports or hobbies anymore so there is no one I can talk to and nothing to hide me from myself.

This time round I don't have anything, nothing reasonable to blame it on, nothing to occupy myself, no social interactions. I've completely cut myself off from everyone and I can't sleep at all anymore. It's 5am, I just finished another binge session after a 2 day fast and I don't know what to do with myself anymore.

52,"So I'm highly neurotic and I know it has a negative impact on my life, mainly preventing me from advancing in my career and socializing.

I know that I should work to get rid of it. But here's why it's so hard.  When I am neurotic, I feel alive.  I don't know why but when I'm in my neurotic state, I feel like I'm me and despite the worrying or negativity, there is a part that feels good and enjoys it.

Meanwhile, when I'm not neurotic, everything feels fake.  Sure it's nice to be able to socialize and be liked and what not but everything feels like a facade.  

Obviously the best solution would be to switch it on and off but that's not something I'm able to do as most of the time, I don't realize what state I and in until much later.  And switching is hard even if I know what state I am in.

So I kept feeling worse and worse. So eventually I somehow made myself tell my parents. Probably the hardest thing I have ever done. Then I found out that my mom doesn’t believe in depression mental illness or chemical imbalance or whatever and she thinks I’m not depressed anyway and that I just have anxiety. At this point the random neck turning and face twitching turned into my teeth chattering randomly and I could barely stop it. At first I thought that I didn’t have depression and I was just doing it for attention but then I felt all the cuts going down my arm over my arteries and that I told no one about this so I don’t think I’m doing it for attention I cut because I want to die and slit my wrists and for the pain that I deserve. After my I got my mom to explain to me why she thought I had anxiety I realized I probably do but from what I understand what’s happening to me can’t just be anxiety. I think mom noticed that I felt that she isn’t taking me seriously so now she refers to it as me feeling depressed which makes me feel that she is just doing that because I felt like she wasn’t taking me seriously which makes me feel that way even more. Talking to my parents About this makes me feel very very uncomfortable. My mom thinks that whatever she thinks is happening is because her and my dad where fighting. Also I’m 13. Now that my parents are actually starting to try to do something I feel super guilty and that I deserve to suffer and deserve to die and I can’t tell if I even want to get help at this point and every time I try to question it or question if I’m regally as stupid as I say I feel even more guilty and like I’m just imagining everything and it is for attention but idk now I’m just asking what am I supposed to do?

56,"Today I found out my father had an strange episode, likely cause of new medication and his state of mind. 
Background story: father &amp; brother shares a loving space with my uncle (my dads brother) &amp; wife kids. 
My dad has a history PTSD from early childhood, separation of 13-14years, 2 years out of work- but on disability due to work related injury. Currently seeing therapist but stopped due to covid. He's also suicidal &amp; has anxiety (My father doesn't get along with his brother &amp; his family that well- we're also not an affectionate family +kids are grown &amp;starting own life)

Here's the story the long story short:
 
My father woke up early morning, asking my aunt who was cooking for a hug because he said he was sad. (Mind u my father is antisocial) She hugs him, probably thinking it was strange but she felt sorry. 
My father then walks back to his room then seconds late come back to ask for a kiss. Naturally, aunt reacted say ""No, you are brothers-in-law.. etc"" Then my father said, ""okay, can I still get a hug?"" She gives him a hug but noticed he kissed her neck... shocked and uncomfortable with what happened, she calls her adult sons and told them what happened. 
Of course, they were ready to defend their mother (my aunt) but then they realized he wasn't in a right state of mind. My father's other sister, who is the responsible caretaker of everyone, rushes over to mediate and see what happened. Upon checking on my dad, she noticed that he was staring into space and when she addressed what went down, he cried and vented to one of the adult sons about his depression and anxiety, loneliness from mental isolation. They all felt bad and can move forward with what happened. However, there is still this lingering feeling from my aunt (victim of situation) that her stepdaughter may be unsafe around my dad.

I found out about this situation hours later with my siblings. Since I am currently living elsewhere, my sister lives with the responsible aunt, &amp; the only one who lives with my dad, is the first sibling who wasn't home at the time of situation.

I'd like advice on how would you mediate both parties, the victim my aunt &amp; my dad?
What are some short term &amp; long term resolutions? 

This has never happened, my dad isn't a sexual predator &amp; I believe it was the new medications +mental health. However, I do not tolerate this behavior and extremely disappointed that this even occurred. We as a family have decided, in order for him to get better he will move with my responsible aunt (his sister) so he can socialize and hopefully decrease his social anxiety &amp; dependency on medication for mental health. 

I'd like to call in a family counselor for everyone that was involved but since its still fresh in everyone's mind, I'd want for things to cool off first.",19Jun2020,1

59,"Throw away for personal reasons , also sorry for the long post , but I promise this isn't a karma whore post. I just need to get it off my chest.

We just passed the one year anniversary of my mom passing away from brain cancer.

A little back story, it was very sudden. She had cancer for awhile, but it wasn't really getting worse....untill it did. In April we were told she had 6 months to a year, and then June she died.

The last few months were the worst times of my life. She was in so much pain, she lost all of her hair, the radiation treatment made her age 20 years in a week.

Anyway, when she died I was relieved.. so relieved, I felt guilty, and still do.

The day she after she died I had my first dream. We were standing outside our old apartment, and she said "" I really wish I could have at least died beautiful""  to which I said "" you are mom"" and then I woke up.

Then about a year without any ( other than weird ones, like me and her working at a video store), so the past week, I've been having dreams where either , we are told she is going to make it, and she recovers. Or the ones where it's like I can say what I need to say to her. To where I cry and tell her I don't want to lose her, and don't know what to do.( Things I never said while she was dying , I tried to be strong )

These dreams stay on my mind for days, and they break my heart all over again. I'm not really religious, but could these dreams be a sign? ( I really want to believe she is living it up in a afterlife , even though I don't really believe it)

Idk guys, I just don't know where to go from here, or what to do.

I'm lost.",19Jun2020,1

61,"I'm not entirely sure how to start this off, this very question has been in my head for quite some time. Not weeks, or months, but a couple years. Ever since a YouTube video fell into my recommendations, I've been doing a lot of reflecting about myself. In fact, I've been doing a lot of reflecting of my whole life, everything I can remember, and I believe that's where I should begin. I use to be extremely compassionate, and completely empathetic of a kid, I believe religion had a lot to do with that. I would freak out on people for hurting animals, or bugs. I would say they where gods creatures, and that every life deserved to live. Mother noted I had some traits of someone with autism, from sensory, to my behavior. I could stare at a fan for hours, and watch static display on the TV we use to have. My parents ended up splitting up around when I was 4, and I was introduced to a new family that was rather the chaos soon to come. Step siblings didn't really get along with me, and in all honesty, I was alone. Of what I could remember in school, I had extreame fits of shouting and disobedience. I've always had that problem, and even to this day still find myself struggling to work with school. I believe it was middle school that changed me, I began to find an interest with science, and the Russian language. In elementary, I didn't have too many friends, in fact I was deemed insane by my fellow peers. No one really wanted to socialize with me, and I stopped caring about people. It wasn't hatred or anything, it was just nothing. For a while mother was guilty from the split up, and would buy me whatever I wanted. And because of that, I was used alot. I use to love giving my stuff to those who wanted it and was too unfortunate to get it. Now I've stopped caring, in fact, I don't even see why I even liked doing it in the first place, they where undeserving. Pathetic idiots that should've just wasted away. But in the end of the day, I was the fool, I was the one taken advantage of. Now it affects me the rest of my life, the sense of paranoia, and that everyone has their own dark intentions. While I was in late elementary to early middle school, I was into setting things on fire, and making firecrackers. I still love doing it, but I haven't done it in quite some time, I also use to do it almost daily. In 7th grade, I was looked at like the kid who didn't give a fuck, the kid who said what he wanted when he wanted, and they knew that I was alone. So they began to talk to me, they wanted to be my ""friend."" And lonly I was supposed to do? And ever since 7th grade, I would never be the same again. Went from a kid who was quiet until provoked, to a kid who had fun fucking with others, and especially authority. I was the class clown, and I would get sent to the principals office on a daily basis. My actions where based on pure impulsivity, I didn't want to be contained, I was beggining to feel a reputation that was my ticket to the top. What's funny is that to the select few who I told that I'm nothing like the act I am at school, they didn't believe me. And everyday I would come home to the realization that I'm still alone. So I began to preoccupy my time alone to become smarter. I would spend hours in front of a screen, learning anything I wanted, (mainly Russian, and physics) as I began to develope with my intellect, my narcissism also grew. Because of the lack of dealing with real friends, and the lack of seeing my true family, and being hated by everyone at home, I lost my sense of empathy. These traits affect me to this day, it makes relationships almost superficial, and usually involve me having to move from person to person. My relationships are rather intense for some, like having sex only after a couple of days of knowing each other. A feeling overwhelms my mind, turns into some sort of autopilot mode. Makes me believe I'm feeling love, but am I? I develope an almost parasitic attachment to my partners, and just only really need that spice in my life. To makout, and have sex, I could accomplish this with anyone really. Infatuation is the word that describes this feeling. Now I'm alone, debating if I should even consider a relationship right now with those who will only bring me down. I was put on this world to do great things, things in which spark my interests. I talk to my therapist about these things about me, asking why I think this way, even though I already know. And I act as if I care, when I don't, in fact, I never seem to do. I've had multiple people crying over family, pets, cheating, friends, all of which is unnecessary garbage. I would act like I care if there was a reason to, but most of the time I don't even show that I care. I can guilt trip who I please, and if they don't show any guilt or sense of submission, I can really drill into them. Make them feel like a terrible person, to the point where they hurt themselves. Is it for fun? I don't know anymore. It's more of satisfaction I guess, once you get me worked up, there must be a price to pay. I do have morals, I know right from wrong, but I don't really care at all. I'm able to convince myself in the moment to feel a certain way about something, and truly never really care. I consider it fake feelings to either appeal to someone, or to spark a reaction. Both traits developed in middle school. I'm still in school, still having episodes of emotions of anger and frustration, that can cause me to cry. Yes, I can cry, I can feel sadness, but it's very rare, and it's usually involving somthing around me. I still lack empathy, I never feel remorse or guilt because I believe everyone plays a part in some capacity. If I make you cry, I believe it's just you finally realizing your wrong. To the rare exception to those few who are close to me, I will try to make things better, because I do care. I don't regret the things I say or do, and I don't care much for your crying, but I'll try to make things better. I believe it's because of my abandonment issues from the past, (Friends and family) but maybe I do have a small amount of empathy left. I often fantasize about my goals in life, to be an inventor, to build and create my own robots, And creations. I also want to have a lot of money, because without money, I have nothing to sustain my hobbies. I also want to compose pieces of classical music for the whole world to hear, but it's too bad people don't listen to much classical anymore. Such a shame too, I'm called a genius on the piano, and organ, But I digress. I've considered interpreter because I was able to learn Russian on my own, but it dosent seem to exite me as much as robotic engineering. I will reach my goals however it may seem necessary, and I believe that I need to start developing a social plan to reach that high level. I'm failing at school because doing the work is difficult given my circumstances. And I consider going to jobcore. I don't plan on living with my parents, and I would rather work alone. I'm not much of the class clown any more, I stopped this year, I got tired of appealing to those around me, when there was nothing to gain anymore, I already had my reputation. I'm 17, and to my understanding, I'm diagnosed with O.D.D, (opisitional defiant disorder)  and depression. But I feel like there's a lot more. I believe I have a personality disorder. I know it's still very early to say such a diagnosis, but I've been like this for years, and it seems to not be changing at all. A couple of people who have autism believe I have it, 2 of my not too close friends, and my step mother who has a kid with autism. I personally don't think that's the case, but I don't 100% know. If I had a true friend to show me how to care and love, maybe I wouldn't be so cold inside, yet superficial on the outside. I haven't really told any of this stuff to anyone else in such great depths because I don't want it to affect me negatively. For the most part, I'm a nice person who doesn't thrive on primarily putting others down, in fact, if you where to meet me, I'm actually a very cool person, or so I'm told anyway. I still have very bad anger management, and can lash out over small things. But I'm actually very funny, and just make others laugh with my sence of humor. I'm not really manipulative because there dosent seem to be anything to gain from most people, unless it's a relationship, I don't know. But I can be a huge asshole with no empathy, remorse, or guilt, and can say or do things to spark a reaction, or debate. Im not someone to really cry too about emotions, but that dosent mean I hate you. I view emotions as weak. But if you are close to me, I'll try to help solve the problem by mapping out the situation and developing a plan to help you continue. Even if I invalidate your feelings, consider yourself fortunate enough for me to help you solve the problem. My close friends get mad at me often for invalidating their feelings, and then many months later realize what I said was completely correct, but they are still mad because I didn't acknowledge their feelings. I keep my friends in small numbers, and I don't say too much because I know better. I've done mbti personality quizes, and I got INTJ multiple times throughout the last 2 years. Is it really a surprise though? Reading about it, I realted heavily to the long description, and some of my friends agreed that it described me very well. I've only met one other INTJ, and he's actually one of the smartest people my age I know, and that alone interests me to friend him. I know I need to be around people like me, but seeing how rare it is, I know its somthing that isnt going to happen anytime soon. These traits of mine affects me everyday, and cause me trouble with relationships, friendships, and just people In general. If you have any knowledge of what I possiply could have, it would be greatly appreciated.",19Jun2020,1

65,"Hi. 

I'll try to make this short. I have had severe depression and suicidal thoughts since early childhood. By age seven I knew that I did not want to live. I had an alcoholic, pathological, abusive father and an absent and narcissistic mother. I have blocked out years of my childhood. I feel the weight of those years every day. Through all of the slight ups and extreme downs in my life, my desire to stop living has always remained. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my life, I have had only a handful of months that I have been happy. A good majority of that time was filled with my ex and former dear friend. I always believed I wanted to be alone before I met him. He made me feel safe and hopeful that life could be okay. 

&amp;#x200B;

He left me for a woman that we had both mutually disliked. I was gutted. We cut off all contact. We had one text conversation where he apologized, and it only worsened my pain. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have not seen or spoken to him in almost two years. My heartbreak is still as painful now as it was on day one. I can honestly say not a day has gone by that I haven't shed a tear over him. I can logically understand that this situation is clearly a result of my childhood or some trauma and that this particular experience is in no way a tragedy, yet, I can't stop obsessing over it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Time is supposed to heal all wounds but I just feel the burden of my emotional scars weighing me down more and more each day. My depression has become worse with time. I am on medication and have sought out many therapists and I have no relief.

70,"I'm 24 and I've realized I have no actual friends. I have several people in my life I always refer to as friends. I've know them for various amounts of time 7-10+ years and we're all mutual friends. My best friend of 10+ years and I used to be so close. For quite some time things have changed. I call or text occasionally and get little to no response. I stopped trying to make plans because she always tells me she's busy. I've noticed that on her time off she's constantly hanging out with other friends but it's very rarely me. I'm lucky to see her 3-4 times a year and we live about 25 minutes apart. I've never said no to an invite from her and always have so much fun when I'm with her. We have a mutual friend of 7 years who is visiting from out of state. We have a group message on snapchat and talked about getting together for dinner as our out of state friend was coming home to visit. I was excited and happy to see both of them and was just waiting for a time and date. The other day I saw they had gone to dinner without me with my ex. I was really hurt. It had been 6 months since I had seen our out of state friend and probably 4+ months since I had hung out with my best friend minus a recent BLM vigil where she came with my ex. I try to be a honest person and I expect people to try to be honest with me as well. I really wish they would just say they don't want to be friends with me or hangout anymore instead of just ghosting me. I've been really hurt by all of this. It has messed with my head and really hyped up my insecurities. I can't help but think there's something wrong with me or that I must not be fun to hangout with because of this. I do genuinely have fun spending time with my ""friends"" and they always appear to have fun to. It's just been a lot to process and these are just a few examples of recent things. This has been happening for quite awhile and I've been making excuses for their behavior for too long. It just really sucks I let myself get played by a group of people I loved and trusted. People I would do anything for. I don't know if I should address it or how. I just am beyond sad. I don't know how to make friends and start over. I thought I had found my people. I just hate slipping further into depression over this and doubting my self worth. Fortunately I do have a great partner who I've been with for nearly a year. I don't know what I'd do without him. I really don't have anyone else. We don't live together yet but I do cherish the time I do get to spend with him. Looking forward to my last therapy session this coming Tuesday. My therapist is always great to talk to. I'm just sad after this appointment I have to stop until further notice due to insurance/financial reasons.

72,"Hi, sometimes for me, dealing with a psychiatrist involves dealing with other people as well, case workers mainly. It seems unnecessary for me to have to deal with that when I'm just there to talk about meds and get treatment for meds. Its almost unacceptably intrusive. I've actually had social workers get mad at my psychiatrist and me for not wanting to deal with them. I'm just there to talk about my meds and go home, I don't need anymore help. They say it's required for the program.   'xxxx behavioral health' or whatever, requires that when you join, you are part of the access team, and its required.

75,"I am 23 years of age. Next year I will qualify as doctor. That single goal is the only thing I will have accomplished in my entire life. I have no hobbies, I have few friends. I flunked out of an RAF training scheme a little over two years ago, after telling myself for 10 years that joining the military was what I wanted to do. I had none of the makings of an officer, no command, no drive, no ambition. I have no idea where I want to go in my career, no particular direction or aspiration.  I was diagnosed with clinical depression nearly 2 years ago when a friend dragged me to the GP after I had a breakdown.

I told myself throughout my entire childhood that only the goal of doing well academically and becoming something successful mattered. Everything else was superfluous. I had a few extracurricular hobbies on and off, but nothing I dedicated myself to, because they didn't matter. The only thing I have consistently done is use the internet, for ""relaxation"".

Now I just feel like I have nothing. I've wasted my fucking life on the internet and on meaningless distractions and now even the one thing I wanted to accomplish feels meaningless because my life outside of it is just so empty. I have deleted my reddit accounts, and accounts on other sites that I have been visiting for over 10 years. Bickering with people on the internet, trying to remain impartial in the mud of everyone arguing while not even being particularly well read on any particular topic myself, scrolling through news channels on Facebook and seeing people just being ugly to each other, has become tiresome.

I do not feel like I have lived for 23 years, I've just existed.

In an ideal world, which I wish this was, I could have my childhood back. I could enjoy it properly, play with friends, play sport, learn an instrument, have hobbies, instead of telling myself none of it mattered. I want it back, but I've accepted that can't happen. The only thing I can do is move forward. I understand the full irony of posting on a site I have literally just said I was leaving, but it's all I know. 

I want to move forward. I'm tired of dreaming of killing myself like it'll just end my emptiness or make everything start over.

- Giving up a decent amount of my free time 
- Not enjoying it 
- Don't feel respected by players 
- Worry what others think and what they may be saying about me. Compare myself to other coaches. 
- Now covid worries

96,"To start off I want to say that I am not one to cry in fact I haven't shed tears since my grandmother died on that fateful December day in 2017. Even when my grandfather passed away just a couple months later I did not cry. (He was 89, and for most of my life the had been battling dementia, so I had little to no relationship with him) I am not a crier, however sometimes out of the blue I feel a enormous black cloud form over me and I have to fight back the urge to ball my eyes out, then after a while it goes away and I forget all about it, until it happens again many weeks/months later. which brings me to last night. I was learning how to do a new job and was being told many different instructions from many different people, but not being one to get flustered easily I was able to handle it, listen carefully, and learn quickly. However, as soon as everyone stopped talking to me and I went back to my task this bizarre feeling came over me as it had in the past... a sudden dark cloud came over me and I want to cry, and like every other time this has happened to me I was able to hold it in. I don't know when this first happened for as soon as it is over I often forget all about it and move on. Now for the questions: Could this be some sort of slight nervous system malfunction? is this some sort of mental health malfunction/illness? Is this common? Have you ever experienced something similar? Should I allow the tears to roll? Or not because it would be odd everyone around including myself would have no idea why I was so sad? Finally, do you have any other thoughts or questions? Thanks for listening!",19Jun2020,1
97,"I (M) met the love of my life (F) 3 years ago. We became friends and eventually left our relationships to be together. The first year was amazing then it quickly took a turn. The mania turned to depression. I know who I'm with and the illness that she copes with. I knew there would be hard stages through life. When she got pregnant we were so excited. Then with the miscarrage came a dark fog. No sex, barely touching. Shes been trying to figure out a medication regiment that works for her. Two days ago she tells me she can't be a good girlfriend and doesn't want the pressure of being one. I never pushed, was always supportive and truly hopeful. I'm crushed.

99,"I've been struggling with CBT lately to deal with my depression (since medication didn't work for me). One thing I've been working on is fighting my feelings of self loathing so that I can build up some confidence. One knee jerk reaction of mine is to wince when someone compliments me. Whether they're saying I look nice or that I did something well or it's about something they like about me, I immediately don't believe it and clam up. It just doesn't make sense with how I see myself. 

Sometimes, I feel like they're blatantly lying, especially when family and friends give half assed compliments about my appearance. I assume they're thinking or seeing that I'm insecure but they don't sound believable and then I feel ugly and pitied (which is way worse lol).

TLDR: I wanna get professional help, get rejected, get harassed, or cannot afford it.

&amp;#x200B;

So my story is simple. Years of child abuse, school bullying by class and teachers alike, my dad disowning me because I kept insisting he apologize for beating my mom and he did not take into consideration that my step sis stole shit from me and attempted to murder me with a steak fork, nobody respecting me, sending me porn videos even though I am asexual due to rapey wapey as my drink has been drugged when I was 19, not having friends even though NOBODY EVER KNOWS I have fucking depression because GUESS WHAT it's hard to see on high functioning bitches.

My mom attempted suicide over her cheating ex leaving her and everyone blamed me for it, because I told her I will beat his ass if he ever sets foot in this house (he treated me like trash for no reason too - just wanted me gone because its hard to fuck my mom when im home). So yeah, whole village pointing fingers so I ran away abroad, no friends, working 6 days a week, having a burnout, boss dragging me around like a ragdoll when I am hyperventilating and having a panic attack, my legs would be covered in bruises because I cannot stand for long - I found love, moved countries again, trying to get friends but no luck, I am just a stupid foreigner who dont speak the language, this cunt tryna moving on to my boyfriend because I am just a fucking slav and slavs are something less or what, inlaws literally watch ""fuck all migrants go back home"" content right in front of me and bully me out of the house despite me cleaning and doing shit that the lazy stoner bitch flat earther inlaw is lazy to do despite not hwaving a job, all the while I am barely able to take a breath cuz constant anxiety.

We move away, I have my job, GUESS WHAT now I am fucking losing my job because of Corona, which will potentially lead me to lose my house, so what, its either back to inlaws or home to my village because the rent in this fucking country is over the roof.

AND NOW LADIES AND GENTS, TO THE REAL FUCKING POINT OF THIS POST

I go to the doctor (somewhere after my bday in Nov, which I spent locked in my house, as everyone we invited with my bf did not come and well I just decided to fuck it and not do anything) - ""pls refer me to a therapist, I am feeling very bad, I think I am losing grip on my life"" ""but you look good, you do not look like someone who has something serious going on"" ... I got up, apologized, resisting the urge to punch this piece of shit who does not deserve to be called a doctor in the face and registered elsewhere - they refer me to a therapist... I tell her all the above, with colorful details. She says she cannot give me meds or help me because I might have some serious diagnosis and whatnot, WAITING LIST IS 6 FUCKING MONTHS but PLOT FUCKING TWIST NOOO because of the corona you get postponed, oh jolly golly joy! U wanna kill yourself? Wait 6 months! Wonderful! Tried to book a private therapist - sorry we do not operate cuz corona.... tried a few others, either scheds full or corona, some just told me to wait out the waiting list because I have been assigned there for a reason....SO WHAT IM SOME AUTISTIC BIPOLAR SCHIZO ASPERGERS PTSD WHATEVER FUCKING LABEL YOU PUT ON ME BUT IM NOT HUMAN? ALRIGHT THANKS. /I do not curse at the people who suffer from the disease. I did not mean to offend, I curse at the label/ I see an ad for online therapy. Unlike in this post, I am being civil, they tell me to complete a questionairre. ""U SHOULD CONSIDER FACE TO FACE THERAPY CUZ ONLINE THERAPY IS NOT FOR YOU"" THANKS BUT I FUCKING NEED HELP ...ANY HELP! ....theres a link to find your local therapist. OH GUESS WHAT, I CHOSE MY CITY AND NOTHING POPPED UP, AND THE ONES THAT POPPED UP FOR NEARBY CITIES TOLD ME TO FUCK OFF ALREADY!!!...I go to another online therapy site. I connect with a listener.... I just wanna talk to someone...first one is responding every 2 hours with 1 word, coldly,  does not give a shit. I close the convo. Connect to another one. GET SEXUALLY HARASSED - CALLED ON WEBCAM, ASKED FOR NUDES AND SHIT. Then I see connect to licensed therapist, but its 150 a month and soon I cannot pay my rent cuz losing my job and do I even wanna sign up at a site which allows sexual harassment?!

105,"So I have major anxiety towards incoming calls at my workplace. 

My department mans a hotline (not our primary job like a call centre, but it’s a small department that undertakes everything from customer inquiries to event management), and every time an incoming call shows up on my phone, I panic and avoid it at all costs, letting it bounce to another colleague. 

It’s easy to let it bounce because I’m now working from home. I was only at work in-office for a week before my country went into COVID lockdown, and during that one week, I wasn’t taught anything or advised anything regarding calls. It was more of the whole — “when you get a call, just message / call us with the questions if you’re not sure of anything” — situation, which is highly impractical when you’re actively on the phone with someone right? 

Anyway, it’s not like I haven’t taken calls before. I used to work in customer service and did case management for an escalation team, which included a bunch of outbound calls and the occasional inbound call (which I tend to miss and call back instead). Also, it’s not like I can’t manage calls. When I’m on the phone, I’m able to slip into the whole “customer service” persona and converse rather normally. 

So, I don’t understand why I get so freaked out with incoming work calls. I know that my anxiety towards it revolves around picking up the call and not knowing what to expect / not being able to give an answer, because I’m so new and might not be able to keep up with questions. The few incoming calls that I DID pick up have all been pretty okay considering, but even 2.5 months into the job, the sound of an incoming call still makes me freeze and panic and want to quit my job that very second. 

The suggestion my therapist gave me was just to bite the bullet, not let myself overthink the panic, and pick up the call. I’ve managed to do that sometimes, but other times it’s just so overwhelming. 

I feel like a liar and a terrible employee and colleague with shirking my hotline responsibilities like this. Does anyone have any tips on how to overcome this anxiety? 

Note: I’m not diagnosed with GAD / Social Anxiety, but I have clinical depression and am in the throes of it right now, and my confidence has been shot to hell. Anxiety accompanies the depression every now and then, but not always. I’m medicated for depression but not really for the anxiety because it hasn’t presented too severely save for this and some anxiety attacks.",19Jun2020,1
106,"I've been on paxil for about a year, and it's been helping me a lot, controlling my sui urges and not crying all day, etc. Making me numb. Which is nice.
I've been in a tight spot financially and I had to lower the daily dose for a couple of days to make the pills I have last until I got paid. However, I had to spend about two days with no medication. And it's been unbelievably horrible. I mean holy hell! No sleep, shaking, pain, and a really bad brain fog and bad thoughts.
I finally got paid and bought some and took my pill. I need it to work fast. In the meantime I'm listening to Rick Ashley singing Foo Fighters' Everlong on repeat and sobbing.

112,"(20M)I'm not sure how to express myself, it's my first time posting anything personal on the internet, sorry if it's messy. When I was a kid I liked to always learn, ask questions and have fun. As the youngest of three when I would see my so called dad talking and joking with my two sisters, I would want to join in. I would ask what's going on, jump around or ask for a turn. But every time he would shame me for wanting attention. When I wanted to show I can do things too or do something funny he would say annoyed  ""Oh! He's here to put on his show. Everyone watch"". He would make me feel like the way I was acting was annoying and wrong. Maybe I was annoying, what kid isn't sometimes? That shit would hurt though. He would get annoyed at or ignore my questions on the history and science shows he would watch. When I tried to bring up a topic of conversation he would say ""I already know about that"". I honestly can't remember a conversation we've had that wasn't him criticizing me. As I got older (middle school) I started to look for validation elsewhere, I believed something was wrong with the way I was so I started copying the behaviours of my friends. This lasted up until junior year of high school when the friends I made by copying them graduated(they were older). I started having anxiety because I didn't know how to act or make new friends. I subconsciously decided to latch on the last thing I thought was true of myself and that is being smart. I started copying the behaviour of smart fictional characters I saw on movies or tv. I believed if people thought I was smart I would be liked. I knew deep down this was fake though, although I would get compliments for being smart I knew it wasn't true. I lack basic life skills and because I went to an alternative hs for difficult teens i feel bad to say it wasn't hard fooling students and teachers I was smart. Part of my ego still believes I need to act smart get people to like me. I'm trying to work on that. 
Does anyone have advice on dealing with an identity crisis, learning basic life skills, needing validation from strangers and self parenting? 
Thank you for reading",19Jun2020,1
113,"Yeah, I'm so mean - I know. 

Seriously tho, it's not a joke at all, and I know assuming someone's mental state isn't right. I'm not trying to diagnose and push an issue on her. I just can't take it anymore and would like some outside opinions, advice etc. 

Context: I would consider my mom to be a good mom. I think I actually won the lottery with my parents. They really are lovely. I am very similar to my dad, he's a very caring and gentle man. My mom is very devoted, she sacrificed a lot for me, cares about me, and always told me she loves me growing up. I owe a lot of my good self-image to my parents ( my mom has always insisted on telling me how amazing, clever and blessed I am, and my father always taught me to trust my judgment and opinions) and I am very confident that they would always support me no matter what. NB: I am an only child (F/19)

When I said I am very similar to my dad, who is gentle, I also meant my mom isn't so much. Which isn't at all the problem. To each their own - as they say. And it isn't at all negative - she's a very energetic and louder person. No problem with that.

However, some of her behaviors always seemed off. This is where the ugly stuff starts. She's always had the ""habit"" of bursting into sudden fits of anger for seemingly mundane things. No physical violence there, but if only people could hear the filthy things coming out of her mouth.... She would curse a lot, insult us (even when I was a child) and the insults would be shockingly graphic. The older I got the more it happened (or maybe it was just me becoming more and more conscious of it). Even though she would say horrible things, I only remember her apologizing once. It's almost like she didn't see anything wrong with what she was saying. What would bother me the most with that is the lack of consistency. I would never know how she would react to anything. The first time I brought a really bad grade from school, she laughed nicely and told me to put more effort into my schoolwork. The time I forget to make my bed, she curses me and stays angry for 3h. 

( Examples ahead: obvious trigger warning)

"" You really can't do anything right can't you? You're really lame, a zero. "" (after I failed to clean something properly)

"" You are not fit for life"" (It actually hurt me a lot.  I cry when I'm angry, which bothers her a lot since sensitivity = weakness in her book. She always reminds me of how she wishes I had more ""character"" and ""ambition"". I know I have enough of that and thanks to God I know my sensitivity isn't a weakness)

"" He's a pussy. He can't do anything."" (to me about my dad, which I also know isn't true)

A lot of them have the same theme and I don't want to write the specific cursing out cause 1) I can't properly translate them 2) I'm afraid to get banned or something

(End of examples)

The other things that worry me are her sudden periods of mistrust and paranoia. The older I got, the more it happened. I can't explain why as I've never done anything to make her think I would be subject to such behaviors. Still, she often has in her head that when I'm texting my friends, I'm actually plotting to meet up with older men and that I'm spending my nights secretly texting on some shady dating apps. She once went as far as making me sleep in the same room as her to check on my phone use ( I never use my phone at night in the first place, which makes it even more f-ed up). No amount of openly showing her my dating-app free phone would convince her otherwise - in her head, I want to get laid quick with mature p\*dos (this started when I was a teen). 

She also often accuses me of purposefully ""dressing s\*\*ually"" even though idk why since most of the time I'm considered to be slightly conservative in my clothing choice. 

I've never noticed her having the same doubts towards my dad, even though who knows what's going on, right?

(Examples ahead : obvious trigger warning)

"" Your texting? With your younger or older group?"" (yesterday. I was texting with my friends)

"" Ok. So today your dressing nice, but tomorrow you've decided to dress s\*\*ual"" ( today, when I told her I want to wear a dress tomorrow)

"" Oh you're texting strangers again"" ( often, and I'm not)

"" Looking like a barbie doll but can't do anything. Empty, lazy  little girl"" ( I put makeup on to go to school; I do it every day)

"" I don't know what you're doing on your phone"" ( often, even though i gladly tell her what I'm doing when she asks)

And the time she burst into my therapy appointment to talk to my therapist about the fact that I'm surely talking with strangers on the internet. She then called her unprofessional when she declined to talk about it (it was my session). 

( End of examples)

There is more. I'm worried about how spontaneous it all is. You never know when she's going to start acting weird and truly ""crazy"". Idk what to do about it. I would like her to maybe see a psychologist (as mental illness runs in the family) but I don't think she'll listen to me. I'm not asking for advice regarding her (I know the obvious is to see a professional) but rather to see if someone else is in a similar situation.

 Is it abuse? I know the behavior is but I don't see it black and white enough to call her an abuser. It is obvious to me that she has problems and it is destroying our family. My parents don't love each other anymore. It has ruined their relationship. Honestly, I find it harder and harder to look past it, but I don't know what I can do about it. 

Thank you lots if you read this far, I know the text was long.",19Jun2020,1
114,"So ever since I was a young girl, if something didn't make complete sense to me, I'd dispute it and I'd get annoyed by it. So if I bought my friends ice cream and they refused to give me some of theirs after I finished mine because I bought it, I'd get mad and say 'why? I'm the one who bought it'. I did this quite often. It was manipulative and selfish. But it's who I am. I also genuinely truly believe human beings are inherently and innately selfish and self serving. Whatever the deed they're doing is, good or bad, the motive is the same to me. Helped a homeless guy? It's to feel like you did good and feel better about yourself even if you tell yourself you did it for the homeless guy. Was nice to somebody? It's because it makes you feel better/gets you ahead/help you in some kind of way. I understand we developed the ability to feel compassion for others and help one another as a way to better survive as a pack but I just can't believe that humans aren't truly in their nature selfish. That isn't good or bad but it is what it is. 

I've had trouble making friends my entire life. To me friendships are so pointless. Maybe it's because I haven't met people who understand me/have the same hobbies interests etc yet, but I've given up on that because I understand no one is going to understand me 100% and the world doesn't owe me that. But I still CAN'T compromise under any circumstances for other people. I can't stand their flaws. I can see right through their motives. I can see who they really truly are deep down and it disgusts me or makes me cringe or weirds me out(I know, sounds edgy. But I can't stop myself from noticing other people's flaws and being irritated by them). I find that I'm a very happy and fulfilled person when I'm not being held back by my mental issues and just doing my own thing. I think therapy and professional help will benefit me but having 'support systems' and 'safe spaces' from friends is bullshit and has just never helped me. I can't stand it.

I love paying for things because I know I will expect something in return and I get what I pay for most of the time. That makes perfect sense to me. Why can't human beings be the same? Why can't people not use me without actually offering something in return? Why can't people be honest and open about mutually beneficial agreements and what they want from each other rather than this smiley, fake extra bullshit? 

I can see my life being perfect even if I'm utterly alone in this world. Sometimes it's a scary thought to think about but I still think I'll be happy even if I'm completely alone. The only thing that disgusts me and I can't stand is exploiting people or any shit like that. That is not something I'd be comfortable doing simply because I choose to lead a lonely life. But I don't feel like I need people. And I do feel like I can move on VERY quickly from people I cut off. It used to be hard and took time and it still does sometimes if the person really hurt me but I'd still move on. I'd cut them off completely no strings attached and no emotions to show.

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, please redirect me to the correct one if so.

I've heard from people that the main indicator of sociopathy/psychopathy is lack of empathy which I didn't have... **until**  recently? I used to be quite an empathetic person, but now I don't? The  ""stick that broke the camel's back"" (like the reason I decided to  finally ask about this) was earlier, when my mum broke down crying in  front of me, and as much as I wanted to, I just.. didn't care? I just  wanted to go back to doing what I was doing. Recently, things like that  have been happening a lot; Situations in which I would normally feel  empathy, but now I just *don't* at all.

Another  example of a situation where I don't feel empathy anymore is (not with a  person) with my pet bird. Sometimes, when I'm bored, I'll make a  reasonably loud noise to.. scare him and make him look at me. And I  don't feel bad about it, despite people telling me that it's a really  bad thing to do.

121,"And yet I am. 

I'm not okay. I don't know why, but that's how it is. I want to lose so much weight, partially because of how much better I looked when I was younger, but also I just want someone to notice things aren't okay but I'm not losing weight fast enough. I'm only down 3kg in a month. I know it's pathetic to be looking fo attention but there you all have it. I'm pathetic. Hopefully now that that's out in the open I can go back to focusing on weightloss rather than wallowing.",19Jun2020,1
122,"I am not sure whether or not I am posting in the right sub, but hopefully someone could be able to answer this. 

I have struggled with anxiety for quite a while now, mainly in social situations, but also in those where I have to perform well (e.g. in school and sports). The worst part for me is the physical symptoms, and I recently figured that the way in which my body reacts in these situations is pretty much identical to how I feel when I am scared. I assume that this has something to do with the adrenaline that gets released. Therefore, I started wondering whether or not your body can get used to the stress hormones, and that way reduce the physical symptoms in the future. So in other words, if I started doing activities that scare me/cause an adrenaline rush, Would I be able to see a reduction in the severity of the physical symptoms in other situations as well?",19Jun2020,1

126,"my friend is suffering quite badly from ptsd and depression, I believe he made an attempt a few days ago but thankfully unsuccessful. he’s easy to anger and when he is angry it’s very explosive. he says it’s getting worse everyday and my heart hurts for him. I try to console him best I can but he just gets annoyed. what can I say that isn’t a cookie cutter response? I don’t have much experience with ptsd outside of my mother who Id just ignore when she got angry, that seemed to work for her. is saying nothing at all better? I don’t know. he’s also american, and I’m canadian so I can’t be there for him in person and it’s so frustrating.

128,"Hi. This isn't about me, its about my oldest brother.

He's been suffering with mental health for 5 years. I have always put in a smile whenever speaking to him, just trying to be cheerful because he never wants to talk about it. He tried medication for 3 years but in his words ""those tablets mess me up even more""

So for 2 years he's told himself and the family that he can get better on his own, he doesnt need any help from the doctors, any charities etc. 

Today he came to our family home saying how he could not sleep all night and my mum made a comment on how he needs to see professionals again as its been 2 years since he came off medication. Which resulted in him leaving the house angry and my mum crying her eyes out.

What can we do? We have tried for 5 years to talk to him, my parents even went down a private route for him to talk to a psychologist as the NHS waiting list was too long. My parents also gave him my nans house after she passed away, so he has no financial worry, which I've told them they need to stop as it doesn't provide any incentive for hin to try and get back to work.

If anyone has any advice on if they have helped someone or have been in this situation it would be great to know what you have! We all don't know what the next step forward is for him.",19Jun2020,1

I have speech apraxia a semi rare speech impediment where you have trouble planning out words sounds and sentences I’ve had trouble with it and honestly hate myself for it with speech becoming more and more vital to life I think I’m horrible because I can’t even do something so simple. I can’t say the things I want or explain myself to people because of it I’m looked down upon and now with being at home and playing online games in some o my free time I’ve been getting assholes a lot more regularly it seems I can’t make it an hour without being told I’m stupid and a retard for it. I also have issues with slight depression and self worth it goes away once I do sports and work out with my team but doing the winter and summer it goes into overdrive because I feel worthless because I’m not working to improve and with track being canceled because of COVID my depression spiraled out of control until I started with cross this year. I have issues with my step father he used to be an alcoholic but now he’s clean and has been for a while I’m trying to make a relationship and I try but sometimes I can’t see past his yelling at me I used to get yelled at for everything I did and this made me worse and I have anger issues I’ve always had a bit of an anger issue but could bottle it up and be fine but I’ve been getting worse and worse blowing up at anything sometimes. I feel like I’m not goin toward in life when I was young I would wake up early and have little sleep and be fine I could think a lot clearer I remember saying “well at least I’m being a little shut now I’m getting it out of my system so when I’m a teen I can be like a young adult and be ready for life when I’m out of school” but now I’m a worse procrastinator and I feel like I’m becoming a horrible person and can’t stop. Even if I want to do something I can’t make myself I’m lazy and can’t do anything. I also have major trust issues My issues with self worth go over into my friendships and I truly feel sometimes That I have no friends and everyone hates me and only deal with me to be nice and not leave out the retarded kid my issues with my step father and not having a father figure for 12 years of my life have lead to me having a distrust for authority and hating people who are higher up or older than me until they prove they are nice I feel like I should trust first but I just can’t and I’ve had issues with dating with people cheating on me and more relationships then I can count looking at a list old the people I’ve dated truly makes me disgusted in myself because I’m such a whore I think I’m useless I’m relationships at times and that’s the reason my last real relationship ended because I tried to tell her she needed someone better and she lost her feelings for me and the 2 people I tried to rebound with that I thought were good left me even though they were the ones to make the first move idk what it is about me but I just feel completely and utterly useless in every thing I do I can’t keep up in sports I can’t keep a lover to save my life I can’t keep my emotions under control and I can’t even talk correctly I feel like I want go anywhere and I’ll just be a loser with no life working a shitty job that I hate and die alone with nobody to mourn me",19Jun2020,2
132,"I am entirely, 100 fucking percent tired of my brain. ADHD, aspergers, and every comorbidity in the book along with them - anxiety, depression, sensory processing disorder, the working memory of a goldfish, uncontrollable stimming, time blindness, a circadian rhythm that either doesn't exist or is 26+ hours, anhedonia, you name it and I hate EVERY FUCKING SECOND OF IT. I get that some people have managed to blindly fumble their way into a place where they make their symptoms work FOR them but I seem to have been built so every benefit from one illness is counteracted by a different one so there's no positive effects from it.

What's worse is, my brain WANTS me to suffer. ""Medication"" is a 4 letter word. I've tried plenty of stuff, be it prescription, OTC, or illicit, and the one thing I've found in common is that ANY DRUG THAT'S HELPFUL will do absolutely nothing in a month's time, sometimes as little as a few days. This is handy, I can try anything I want and quit cold turkey like I never started except for the occasional physical withdrawal, but the absolute bane of my existence because no doctor will believe my meds stop working THAT FAST.

And don't even get me started on therapy. They try to teach coping mechanisms, but those require being able to remember them and stick with them when I can't even remember what the hell they were long enough to write them down and lose the post-it note if I manage to. Worse yet, they made me aware of the underlying issues and why I do the things I do so that I can ""make a conscious effort"" to improve but all that did was make me realize that no, I AM NOT IN CONTROL. Not in the slightest. I'm a dad yelling at a bratty toddler who's in control of my body and if the dumb shit feels like doing something they might eventually half-ass it but usually they blow me off to watch YouTube videos I don't even enjoy. 

I'm not even exaggerating, if my subconscious/unconscious is feeling angry at me it will quite literally leave me paralyzed by taking away all the automated processes for walking, typing, opening doors, etc and require me to consciously, manually, control individual. god. damn. muscles. to be able to move at all. I've taken to keeping a taser on my desk for when it does this because physical pain is one of the few things it understands and I can usually eek out enough manual control to give my hand a good zap for that sweet adrenaline, which is quite literally my only motivator these days since dopamine doesn't do anything anymore and if I scare/abuse the toddler living in my head they'll play along for 5 minutes maybe. This is the only way I ever get anything done.

I just want a fucking cure. Just figure out WHY my brain is as broken as it is, jam a scalpel in there and FIX THAT SHIT. Fuck neurodiversity, yall can keep it if you like it but if they figure out something that's not ""well, you're having trouble concentrating so take this diet meth and call me in a month lol"" I'm taking it, I don't even care how much it costs because my procrastination has kept me from getting a credit card to ruin my score. If I could take my consciousness and transplant it into the subconscious of basically anyone else, I'd take it in a heartbeat, regardless of how much of an impact it has on my ""personality"" because at this point my personality is literally just terrible pop culture references badly covering up a laundry list of mental illnesses.",19Jun2020,1

135,"This is totally just a get my feelings out post. I started drinking, smoking and taking anything I could get my hands on when I was about 12 or 13. I was promiscuous, a thief, a liar, and drunk or high all the time. I’ve been horribly self destructive for as long as I can remember. 

When I turned 21 I became pregnant with my first child. That was the first time I was sober for 9 months. I abused alcohol so many times after her birth, as well as after the birth of my other two children. I put my partner through a lot of stuff over the past 10 and a half year’s.. and I wasn’t the best mom. I struggle with a lot of guilt over that. 

I had a pretty severe mental health crisis in the end of may which led me to the doctors office. I finally have a diagnosis, I have bipolar affective disorder as well as borderline personality. I have been on medication for two weeks now and the world feels more calm and bright already. 

I know I can be a good partner, and a good mom. I already like myself a little better... I’ve been mentally sick for as long as I can remember and I will get better. It will take time and I have a lot of fences to mend.. but I’m hopeful for the future.",19Jun2020,5
136,"Hi everyone! My cousin has struggled with bipolar manic episodes for a really long time. He was doing well for 6 years but missed a day or two of his meds recently and has gone down hill real fast. He is posting really really horrible things about me and my mother on Facebook that aren’t even true. He’s calling us and everyone else in our family horrible names saying he can’t wait for us to get fat again to math our ugly (and otherer things along those lines). It’s really hard to see past this and be able to forgive him so I am curious what people think about these actions. I sort of have the mindse, especially being that this isn’t his first time, he knows the consequences of not taking his meds and is ultimately responsible for taking care of his mental health. I also feel like mental health isn’ an excuse for being an asshole? There’s plenty of people who struggle (myself included) with mental illness that don’t bully others! When he gets back on track too it doesn’t even seem like he is sorry for any of the things he’s done. He’s never apologized to anyone. 

I would really like to know others opinions if I’m being unreasonable for not wanting to forgive? When do actions go to far where mental health stops being a valid reason?",19Jun2020,1
137,"I made a single, detailed post outlining my general dissatisfaction with my life, a trend which has perpetuated throughout my entire life and resulted in numerous extended periods of depression and suicidal ideation; and a trend I am trying my hardest to break.

My post was simply a request for help and advice in a time when I am trying to transition from person I no longer want to be, to a more proactive and healthy person, while also having to contend with my impending entry into the work place.

**I was completely ignored and let down by this subreddit.**

Now, I am attempting to be resilient, I know that occasionally a post on any sub will get overlooked, but frankly after having reviewed the New tab on this page, I am **disgusted** by how little attention the majority of posts get. My post didn't get a single vote or comment and was completely lost to new. I would hope this would be the exception, but even a cursory review shows that it is by far the norm.

Let me make one thing perfectly clear. If you are coming to this subreddit and sorting by ""Hot"" or ""Top"" and only commenting on popular posts or posts you find ""interesting"" **YOU SHOULD NOT BE HERE.** You are helping no-one and leaving far more people to be completely ignored. If you're coming on here to read interesting stories about people's lives and circumstances and that takes priority over actually sorting by New and reaching out to people desperate for help, **you are a not being a good person.**

Now personally despite how angry I am, I do not personally care that my post got ignored. I am actually in an alright place overall, with a degree of anxiety about the future, but I can seek help elsewhere. There are people on here reaching out for help who need it, far more than any ""Top"" post which already has tens of comments. Help them, be a good person.

140,"Bare with me this is rather a long one, I’m trying to explain as best as I can. 

Since quarantine, I’ve been inside the house for months. I have no where to go since I don’t really hang out with people and don’t want to hang outside. But it’s just now that I realized that something is wrong with me, mainly because I wasn’t paying any attention to it. So let me tell you a bit of my life. I’m an introvert, I don’t really talk to anyone nor do I want to. I’m actually a sophomore now, pass the school year with what would’ve been a straight A but my English teacher kinda hates his class somehow so I got a B in his class. My grades in his class never go any higher than a B. There’s nothing much about me to know because all I ever do is spend time in my room alone and likes to be alone. I’m going through a lots of things right now so I’m stressed out. Anyways, I want to share what I’ve been experiencing for the few months I’ve been in the house:

1. I get paranoid, or unreasonably anxious because while I do what I always do i always feel like someone is watching me. But really no one is there, still it feels like someone is. When I go get something to eat from the kitchen I don’t like when the door to the laundry room is open because I feel like I was being watched from there, when I go brush my teeth I keep thinking someone is behind the shower curtains, going back to my room thinking someone is in the closet or at the back of the door waiting to lunge at me. I was googling it and it said something about delusions. As much as I like to think I’m being delusional or being dramatic. I still get suspicious about what’s happening. I live in a rather quiet and peaceful neighborhood, rarely see my neighbors so it gives me anxiety thinking that something could go wrong.

2. I remember once when I heard my mother call my name, but she would be either sleeping or not there. But this one is actually very rare to me now, but I do sometimes hear ringing or weird noises at night when I’m trying to sleep. Which i can’t really sleep well by the way I have fatigue possibly from insomnia, i have a bad sleeping habit.

3. Often I do for some reason have unwanted racing thoughts about death or other unusual thoughts I get out of nowhere. I lose interest in things quickly. You can see me finish a Netflix show but then when I want to watch it again it’s suddenly is very boring for me as if I seen it a thousands of times but i have only seen it once.

4. This is something I’ve seen rarely but often when I was an 8th grader I see a glimpse of a black shadow. This one is what I told my parents about, but they didn’t believe me.

That’s all I can think of my experience. Feel free to ask me questions because I’m rather confused with myself trying to figure out what’s being going on with me. Sorry if I don’t make sense at all.",19Jun2020,1
141,"Constantly hazy. Like can't register any super complex thoughts, can't think, can barely remember anything from recent memory. I often forget what my gender is or whether or not I have a name, how tall I am, etc. More or less, I feel constantly stoned but I'm completely sober.

Emotionally colorblind. Like totally oblivious to the things I say and the ramifications behind them.

I'm kinda overly lacking in self preservation. Like sometimes I'll forget to eat or drink, or when I'm presented with a situation that could pretty easily harm me, it's usually no big deal.

I think the main takeaway from this is that I'm pretty much entirely disconnected with my body. It's kinda handy sometimes but it kinda feels like this isn't my body. Like I'm borrowing it. Yknow what I mean?",19Jun2020,1
142,Because same,19Jun2020,1
144,"  Okay. We’re posting this since we couldn’t get any kind of advice in real life. 

We have a friend (let’s call him Mike). Mike has bipolar disorder, and he’s **very** volatile.

For a long time, he told us dramatic stories about his life, and since about a year we have noticed that these stories are quite fake. For example, claiming that his sister got angry and punched him, breaking his teeth. We know that this isn’t real because, given his dramatic and generally victimist tendencies, if his teeth really were broken he would have made a big deal of it (specially since in our country oral healthcare is very expensive). Nonetheless, he didn’t. 

We don’t want to fight with him, but sometimes he gets very delusional, so we have an agreement between the rest of the members of our group of friends in which when he tells us stories of dubious authenticity, we give Mike our condolences, but we do not dive into how dramatic and sad his life is, because we don’t want to feed his tantrum nor his hate towards the person he’s antagonising.  

This worked for a time, but now the thing is scalating. He gets very angry for small things and makes a big deal out of it. Mike gets angry even if we try to talk to him with a warm approach, and he gets really mad if we try to change the subject or just do not answer. He has always been like this, but since a year he gets angry at one of us like every week. 

Mike used to have a girlfriend, who broke up with him in a very cold way. He told us that we can still be friends with her, but we know that’s not true. A few days ago he saw us commenting her post in social media and got **really** angry. He told to us with a quite passive-aggressive and disturbing tone that he didn’t mind that we were friends with her, however he told us that she is a horrible person, that if we got into trouble with her she would stop talking to us with the same coldness, that he does not talk with our exes and that he may need to stop talking to us for a time because the mere fact of seeing us liking her posts makes him so sick. 

We found this very manipulative and got scared because he had never done something like this. Is like the thing is scalating and he’s getting worse and worse. He even remarked that the girl had ruined his life (I promise you, it was not that much of a big deal, she just broke up with Mike via Facebook), that his mental health got worse because of her and that he even tried suicide. He even blamed we being friends with her as a cause of his depression. He even told us that he wanted to marry her! (They were friends for a couple of months and dated for like a year, all of this happened while we were minors)

We know the girl and this is not that truly deep. What she did was wrong. However, the girl recognized that when we called her out. She even wanted to talk with him but didn’t because of his volatileness. He paints the situation so it seems that he wants to make up, but it’s the very opposite. He really does hate her, and we know it.

We don’t know what to do. This is burning us. However we don’t want to dump him, specially knowing his condition. But we are very young and inexperienced, and have no realiable adult figure that could help us. This is very draining, we feel like we’re his nurses and we need to measure every simple word or behaviour so he doesn’t explode. He’s going to therapy and we’re doing our best to be good and kind friends with him but shit, it’s imposible to negotiate with him in any subject, he thinks he’s always right, makes a big deal of everything and never apologizes. 

What should we do? I feel kind of embarrased posting this, but we really don’t have anyone to guide us.",19Jun2020,2

It feels like a void.

To fell the void I watched random shows that I enjoyed, I didn't like talking to my friends - felt really left out. But I was extremely hurt when I didn't code for like a month and still I didn't feel the need to do it.

It was then that I wanted to do something for people who go through this, an app which doesn't judge you, doesn't respond to your feelings but I can always have conversations with it, a private space, a place I can be myself and still not be worried about anything. This was a motivation to get back, get back to work, get back to Coding, I coded, shared my updates with the app, ranted about things, shared my smallest feelings, anger and frustrations, it felt like someone is listening to me, I would go back to any specific day and read what went wrong, correct it and improve, it helped me recover, today I feel I am good, I am back, I talk to people, I enjoy games with my friends, I behave normal, I code, I enjoy my life now.

This is a great place to be in, I am leaving this app here for anyone who would want to try it - [Live App](https://rajchandra.me/r/laPXcx2KW?s=mentalHealth&amp;m=reddit)",19Jun2020,1
149,"I saw a counsellor for a while but they kept pushing me to go to group rape counselling (got mildly sexually abused as a child by some older neighbourhood kids) so I quit that. I'm not really interested in going back and want to help myself. 

*Thank you so so much to anyone who might have resources to share with me!*

These are some issues I identified that bother me regularly:

**What do I struggle with day-to-day?**

* Believing that many things I see/experience have an ulterior/secret message, meaning or motive, leading to distressing overthinking and jumping to surreal conclusions
* Never feeling like I meet ""good"" standards so I've given up on all the stuff I used to enjoy, such as writing and painting. Feel like nothing I ever do is good enough and I'm a failure
* Focusing - zoning out when people are talking to me one-on-one. Zoning out watching TV and reading books or driving. Caught up in random thought trails that jump eratically from one topic to the next
* Conversing normally - I feel like my topics of conversation are immature and childish, and that I can't properly contribute to adult conversations. Although this may not be true and might just be social anxiety
* Panicking during every conversation about what I'm saying/doing/how I look. I never catch a break from this
* Depressive thoughts. Can't really have good thoughts about myself. Can sit staring at the wall for hours and hours whilst my mind runs wild with self-deprecating thoughts (""you're stupid, pathetic, never amount to anything, can't do anything right"" and so on).
* Believing that nobody likes me, including family. So I don't talk to anyone, or ever go out anywhere 
* Generally just don't feel like I fit in with other people
* Abused drugs since age 16, moved from Class A to weed which I now smoke daily although I try to quit frequently
* Poor body-image 
* Anxiety attacks and depressive episodes after sex (but only if I orgasm)

&amp;#x200B;

**What do I struggle with occasionally?**

* Heard voices since childhood - difference voices shouting my name. Although this happens infrequently
* A few weird disassociative episodes. For example suddenly thinking that I am stuck in Hell (was actually in my bedroom watching a movie) and my boyfriend is a demon who is trying to eat me alive. Thinking people are coming to my house to kill me so I hide with a knife. Or one time after several hours of self-deprecating thoughts, screaming ""I hate you"" repeatedly into the mirror - my reflection was ""me"" and I - the person in reality - was something else. Not sure what, just not me. 
* Letting my mind run wild and staring at things, my eyes start to warp them into other things. I.e. staring at a shadow on the wall my mind makes it look 2d then turns it into a weird scene that is different from reality
* Self harming and suicidal attempts/thoughts

**Isn’t this a common reaction we come across when we talk about men and mental health. Men can be stressed, depressed, anxious, and agitated too. Men can be weak and vulnerable too. We all possess emotions and going low and high on our emotions is a sign of human behavior and is not gender-specific.**

156,"When I was in elementary, I had a tutor named Sarah. She was a great mentor. She was compassionate, wise, and someone I trusted. One day while she was helping me with my homework I blurted out, “Sarah. I don’t like it when I’m angry. I want to cut it off.”

“You want to cut off the feeling of anger?” she asked surprised.

“Yea. When I get angry, I can’t control myself and only bad things happen,” I said. “I yell. I say mean things. I hurt people. And sometimes I get so mad I want to punch something.”

“I see,” Sarah paused. “Sometimes I do bad things when I’m angry too. But you know what? You shouldn’t cut off your anger.”

“Why?” I asked.

“Because anger is an emotion and emotions are what make us human,” she smiled.

“Oh okay,” I said and went back to my homework.

# Anger is a Powerful Emotion

I think many of us can identify with Little Andrew and his relationship with anger. It is such a powerful emotion that sometimes we lose control. We say hurtful things we don’t mean. We take things too far. We act irrationally.

Because of this, it is easy to see anger only as a negative emotion. But anger can actually be constructive rather than destructive:

1. Anger tells you information about yourself.
2. Anger activates you into action.
3. Anger helps you fight for something you value.
4. Anger helps you build self-respect.

## Anger Tells You Information About Yourself

Anger is a secondary emotion. That means it’s a response to a primary emotion such as embarrassment, disappointment, or fear.

In this way, anger is like smoke. Just like how smoke tells you that something is burning, anger tells you that you are reacting to a primary emotion. Therefore anger is a signal that something deeper is happening and can be used to learn more about yourself.

When you get angry, take a moment and explore the [Emotion Iceberg](https://heem.substack.com/p/how-to-explore-the-emotion-iceberg). Figure out what primary emotions are underneath it and pay down any [Emotional Debt](https://heem.substack.com/p/introducing-heem-publication-and#what-is-emotional-debt) if needed.

## Anger Activates You Into Action

Once upon a time I was let go from work and I was devastated. I was depressed, I struggled with low self-esteem, and I couldn’t get motivated to do anything. But as I was thinking about my time at the company, I got angry. I got angry because I realized that there were a lot of things that weren’t handled properly. I got angry because I felt like I was never really given a fair shot. This anger gave me the energy I needed to step out of my sadness and move forward.

In this way, anger can activate you into action. It can also help you overcome emotions that keep you stuck like fear, doubt, and anxiety.

Earlier I mentioned that anger can make you act irrationally. It is precisely this trait that allows you to bypass the fear, doubt, and anxiety that are telling you not to do something. By getting angry and irrationally ignoring these warnings, you are now capable of moving past them.

## Anger Helps You Fight for Something You Value

One of the reasons people get angry is when something they value comes under attack. This can be a set of beliefs, a family member, or even a physical object that they cherish. Anger is a signal that you can use to protect these values. It lets other people know that something negative will happen if they threaten your values in any way.

Alternatively, anger can also reveal your subconscious set of beliefs. For example, you may get angry in response to a joke. This can help expose a value that you may not have been aware of.

## Anger Helps You Build Self-respect

One time when I was playing pickup basketball, my team was down 5-11. The other team only needed 2 more points to win. I started yelling at my teammates in anger to play some defense and play harder. In my mind, we had the better team. We shouldn’t have been losing. We went on to win the game after scoring 8 points in a row.

Afterwards I went up to my teammate Drew and apologized for yelling and he said, “Don’t be. We needed it.” My anger communicated to the team that we were better than how we were playing. It communicated to them that we could win if we fought. And they appreciated it.

In this way, anger can be used to build self-respect. When you choose to see yourself as a value worth protecting, you can then activate yourself with anger to fight and set boundaries. For example, anger can help you stand up for yourself when someone disrespects you. It can also help increase productivity when you’ve been lazy.

Hopefully by now you can see that there are benefits to anger. Like my tutor Sarah said, emotions are a part of what makes us human. So the next time you get angry, see it as an opportunity. Embrace it, dig into what’s causing it, and learn how you can use it to grow.

157,"So I had a male therapist. We didn’t click and I didn’t feel comfortable. So I switched to a female therapist and I absolutely love her. She actually listens and doesn’t like make me feel less than her. 
She listens my knowledge as well and looks at me like an actual adult (19f) and not some moron who doesn’t know what she’s talking about. 

So I’m thinking if I switch to a female psychiatrist. Will it be the same? I’m currently going to male psychiatrist and it’s like he doesn’t listen. He always rushes me. He doesn’t take anything I say into consideration. And I thinks he thinks I’m stupid.

163,"I don't use reddit, so i'm sorry if I do a no-no

I (20) live with my parents and my brother in Canada. My mother (50) has been showing signs of mental illness, and what I'm pretty sure is schizophrenia 

she's shown signs of mental illness in the past, but ever since this pandemic started, it feels like it's all just snowballed into a huge mess. Heres a list

**1.**Stockpiling. Our basement is stuffed with more food/resources than we can ever need, including an air soft pistol and machete. This is for 'when shit hits the fan' as she often puts it. We've dumped at least 3,000$ into this. 

**2.** Fears. She believes the cops might break into our house and force us to vaccinate against covid. She leaves trail cameras around the house, has installed a small security system, bought barricades for the doors and bought things that are supposed to make the windows of our house bullet proof. 

**3.** Hallucinations. She talks about seeing things a lot, anything from beams of light in the sky to sprawling scenery and people in the backyard that in no way exists. She talks about hearing spirits and guardians angels. I usually find her awake anytime from 12-3am just sitting in the dark and staring out windows. 

She is aggressive and doesn't listen to reason, picking fights wherever she can in my family, distancing herself from her friends and even my older sister whom was her voice of reason for a very, very long time. My brother has anxiety and refuses to do anything about it, insisting this is just something spurred up by the pandemic and that it'll go away when she has more structure to her day. My father has been (for lack of a better word,) a limp-dick loser for the past decade and a half and honestly just likes to feed into the idea of having guns and doomsday prep. 

They both watch these hard-core conspiricists that talk about the end of the world and covid being a hoax, as well as right-wing leaning videos, like fox news and other stuff I don't recognize. This is the complete opposite to what my mom watched before this, usually being a fairly centrists/left kind of person.  Her political leaning doesn't really matter to me, but she's very bigoted, and makes me worried as I am apart of a few minority groups that often gets bashed in these videos. 

I'm sort of jobless, addicted to drugs and have only 2 friends that live in a different country. I have several mental illnesses myself, including anxiety and ptsd, and my therapist has long since stopped returning my calls. I pretty much spend my days playing video games, working a freelance online job and fighting my suicidal tendencies. She refuses to help me get my medications, and I don't know how/have no way of doing it myself, so being the family's activist and getting shit sorted out is getting way too hard for me to handle on my own. 

I've looked into mental health help and my brother even called a crisis line- they said that they'd have to bring a cop while assessing my mother's mental health, and that is one of the biggest issues since she's so scared of them. 

I love her. Even though she's grown bigoted and hateful, I want nothing more than to see her get the help she needs and to reunite her with the friends and family she pushed away. She's lived a long, rough life and doesn't deserve to suffer like this.

I'm really sorry this is so long but  
**TL;DR:** My mom has been showing signs of schizophrenia for the past 3 months, and the only way to get her help is to get a cop involved. She's terrified of them and will refuse. The rest of my family would rather wait and see what happens than get the help right now. We are thousands of dollars in dept and I'm scared.

I'm sorry if I don't answer replies, but I will read them. My parents monitor my computer use sometimes and I'd be fucked if she caught this post.",19Jun2020,1
164,"29m and my problem is that I don't typically feel anything about much of anything. I've felt like this for probably 10-15 years now.

I'm anhedonia personified. I don't feel sad or depressed, generally my mood is stable and I feel alright. My mind, while good at the task at hand, is essentially devoid of any background or internal monologue the rest of the time. I almost have to procrastinate to an extreme to give me some anxiety to do much of anything, otherwise there's just no middle ground. 

I'm either totally devoid of any feeling at all or I'm winging it because I have 5 minutes to do something that will take 20, and I'm only doing it because I have to. I have completely lost any creative impulse at some point along the way. It's like when you look at a menu at a restaurant and nothing sounds good, except I wake up everyday with that feeling

165,"It's a long story but basically I was misdiagnosed as bipolar a long time ago and have been on lithium for 8 years. At 900mg, my psychiatrist and therapist concluded that I should get off lithium.

I have tried to find info on what to expect if you are NOT bipolar and haven't really found much so I thought I would write a little about my experience if anyone is interested. I am not implying the items listed are a direct result of decreasing lithium, just that they occured after the decrease. I have also started 2 new meds: adderall and paxil.

First decrease (900mg to 600mg): 
-terrible insomnia for a few weeks
- a little emotional, akin to PMS
-dramatic increase in creativity
- a bit more anxiety, but that could be attributed to just being nervous about what to expect
-able to recover from upset mood more quickly/move past hurt feelings faster
- lost 15 pounds

Second decrease (600mg to 300mg):
-only been a few days so I will update later if anyone is interested
-bad insomnia again
-increase in anxiety but feel more in control of my actions, I feel my adderall and excessive caffeine intake might have a lot to do with this
-talking fast, but not disjointed
- more impulsive but not self-destructive (interrupt people a little more mostly, i don't go on spending sprees or say hurtful things or anything like that, you could argue it's an increase of confidence and energy and I'm just getting used to it)

169,"If this is too long, I know everyone is busy and has a life, etc etc, just scroll down and read the TLDR. Please.

My life looks perfect from the outside: good at doing almost everything I ever tried (I'm not trying to be arrogant, just wait I need your help, I really do and I need to be honest to get it), successful and balanced overall, albeit being pretty eccentric in some ways. The problem is this: somehow I've always been the person people shit on in my personal life. 

I got stalked and molested before I was even 19, before I ever even had a casual date. My experience of men was tainted from there. I tried really really hard, found a few really good friends and was finally feeling at one with the world. These people gave me hope.

Then, my best friends, who happened to be guys, bullied me and almost tried to coerce me into saying yes to something I didn't want (had to say NO loudly and clearly 8-9 times before they stopped, had tears in my eyes at the end). That was a deep wound, emotionally and years of friendship and trust went down the drain in my head. At about the same time, one of my female friends disclosed a medical problem (not serious) that I had requested her to not tell anyone in front of a whole group of people. Trust, gone down the drain. Then, a guy who I'd really liked from a distance for a long while approached me, and lo and behold, turns out I'm the idiot and he's just a really mean guy who has some issues with women taking advantage of my poor boundaries and my kindness.

All of these things happened around the same time and left me with two realisations: 1. That I had poor boundaries and 2. that people basically need to be kept in check most of the time and you can't ever really trust someone. I spent the rest of my social time being careful to remember these things when interacting and it seems to have solved the social issue. People no longer treat me like shit if I enforce boundaries and stay aware to give reminders of that. I focused on my work, which I truly enjoy more than anything else. I enjoy it in a way an artist enjoys painting and that love has saved me from all the shit I've ever been through. 

TL,DR: Practically, I'm fine, good, successful even in the worlds' definition. But I have lost hope in people ever being nice to me or caring about me at a personal level. Also, I'm fairly young and I want to love someone halfway decent, I want to be able to look into someone's eyes and not see deception. Being smart enough to see through hurts like nothing else. I do things for people, I'm sincere, I'm always there when they're really in trouble and everyone seemingly fucks me over. Be brutally honest here, please. Tell me if you were here and something helps, tell me if you think I'm the problem, tell me if you think I'm too sensitive. But, please try to help. Thanks.",19Jun2020,2

I was considered a gifted child when I was younger but that all changed around junior and senior year of high school because I didn’t know how/was too scared to ask for help and didn’t know how to handle all my stress. Me and my sister aren’t close so it took a lot to open up to her and it bothers me because she didn’t comfort me, she just yelled at me basically and told me that’s how life is, it’s hard.

173,"Hello. I am a 26 year old male living in a Western European country. In the following ‘few’ words I will try to summarize my life in the hope that someone sees what I am missing. 

  
  First off: I have emetophobia. I have an irrational fear of vomiting, feeling nauseous and everything that could possibly cause either of it.   I would argue that the fear manifested at the age of 9 or 10 when I got the stomach flu after having visited family the day after Christmas. My dad had the flue a few days before that and so did a lot of other relatives, at that point in time I was not really afraid of being sick, so I did not think about keeping distance from my dad. Anyway, I can’t quite remember how it all developed, but I do remember waking up vomiting and having the reaction and sense at that point in time to catch it with my hands, so I wouldn’t get my bed dirty. I remember my mother coming into my room, telling me that it wasn’t a problem and that everything would be fine. I have no memory of what happened after that, she however told me that I apparently vomited in a very painful looking and violent way. I remember that the vomit had a very strong disgusting potatoish taste, as this was mainly what I ate at my relatives. I wouldn’t eat potatoes for years after the incident.     
  Up to that, I would have described myself as a relatively normal child. Being born before 2000 I feel like I had a very privileged childhood without social media being a large part of it. I was very active, played a lot of sports, was generally happy (I actually remember the feeling of that) and I did not even think about food. I have always had a rather slim build, as I never ate much and was constantly running around. My parents also never forced me to finish meals. If I wasn't hungry anymore I should not have to eat.   In retrospect this seems unusual as my friends' parents almost always had a 'finish your plate' attitude. 

  
  My behaviour, my state of mind, my attitude toward things, all that changed subconsciously after that last vomiting incident. Still being in the equivalent to a middle school, my mother had to come and get me more and more often as I apparently had stomach aches. As soon as I was home these stomach aches stopped, which of course led my mother to believe I was faking it. So she became angrier with me. We checked in with doctors. They couldn't find anything. So I got some pills (homeopathic) and my stomach aches slowly went away.       
  For a long time everything seemed to go back to 'normal' and I was about to go to high school soon. My teacher claimed that I had a gift for languages, an opinion I didn't share (as you probably will be able to tell by the mistakes I make throughout this). So instead of attending a high school that specialized on languages I decided to follow my guts and what I thought would make me more happy. With two of my best friends I attended a high school specializing on sciences and math. I even gained a few new friends early on and everything was very exciting.   

  
  Parallel to all that happening, I ate less and less as time went by. I still enjoyed sports very much, but I gradually stopped seeing my friends outside of school. After two school years or so my parents decided to go for a beach holiday in southern Europe.   The first time my parents saw me basically naked (in swim shorts) they were shocked. They apparently haven't had such a view of me for quite a long time. Hence, neither of us had realized how much weight I had actually lost.   It was like 35 °C outside and I was constantly freezing. This holiday time was basically, like constantly being on drugs. I was to weak to enjoy anything. Additionally two other 'vomit incidents' happened: A boy swimming in the sea was caught by a wave full on and swallowed a whole lot of the salt water, which basically made him puke instantly. The texture of the vomit floating in the sea I can still remember quite vividly. What bothered me wasn't the fact that he vomited. It was the irrational fear of me getting in contact with the vomit (which was spreading in the sea) somehow and possibly catching something. The other incident was as my parents and I were renting a pedal boat, severely underestimating the waves. My dad and I got pretty nauseous just a few minutes being on it. It got so bad that we had to jump into the water, dragging the boat back to the shore. 

  
  Before this holiday I was deeply involved into an online video game (Guild Wars). This game gave me a lot. Mostly social interactions. It was challenging and a perfect distraction from my real problems that I didn't even knew I had. So this was taken from me during these holidays and I was stuck in my malnourished body and of course in my head as well. The state of mind in that current time was later described to me as 'tired of life', wish is different from being suicidal. I had no intention of killing myself, but I really didn't care if I had died. This came to  my realization on our flight back. Basically we experienced some turbulence's. The plane that we originally were supposed to be flying home in with wasn't available, so we got a smaller one. Everything was a little off about it. The pilot was wearing khaki shorts. We had to go to the plane by foot. The windows inside were leaking what I assumed to be condensation water. Anyway, we got up and the flight was rough. A lot of woman and children screaming. But I was like 'meh'. Who cares. If we die, we die.     
  Arriving back home and settling into our everyday life. My parents did everything to get me to a doctor. At this point in time nobody knew what was wrong with me and why I was eating so little, while feeling so sick all the time.  First stop was my pediatrician, who basically send me straight into a hospital due to me being dangerously underweight. Which was horrifying from my point of view, as I hadn't even realized the severeness of the situation.   

  
  I can't remember how much time exactly passed between this visit and me being hospitalized, but I do remember missing school while being in the hospital. Which led to an increase of negative feelings against my parents and especially my mother, as I had the feeling that she was responsible for me being in this position. This of course hurt her very much. And still I wanted her to stay with me, especially during nights.     
  In the hospital a lot of blood work and other non-invasive tests were done. All without any significant conclusion. My condition got worse and if no solution would be found soon I would have to be fed artificially. I remember nights where my EKG would pull me out of my sleep because my extremely slowed down heartbeat would trigger some beeping warning signals. 

  
  The most memorable part during my hospital stay was when they decided to put in a gastric tube into my stomach. Unfortunately they tried and failed exactly this with a boy I was sharing the room with, with him being under anesthesia. So they decided I would have to do it while being fully awake. A horrifying situation for me. For everyone who doesn't know what I am talking about: A tube was put into my nose and pushed from there into my stomach, while the other end with a little computer was strapped to my chest. During this procedure your gag reflex is going to be triggered, which I of course immediately associated with vomiting. And while being around 160cm tall at that time and weighing around 40kg or less, for the first time in my life I realized what a human body, even such an underfed one, was capable off. Three male doctors, two nurses and my father all had to hold me down, as I was giving every last bit of what I had to prevent that tube going into my stomach. Only when they allowed my father into the room (my parents were waiting outside behind a glass window) and my mother started crying I started to cooperate. I gagged a lot. Gagged and swallowed the tube until it was through.   

  
  The feeling of the gastric tube wasn't as bad. It got bad when I was eating the little bits I had to, mainly cookies. Each swallow would pull on the tube downwards, which made eating even less attractive to me.     
  Analyzing the data the tube provided, of course, led to nothing. I had an increased amount of stomach acid, which could be explained by the fact that I wasn't eating. So the conclusion was clear. There was no physical reason for me feeling sick and being underweight.   

  
  During the time in the hospital some few close friends from school and my class teacher where allowed to come visit me bringing letters from everyone. This and the fact that another boy I was sharing my room with, who was a few years younger than I was, was doing math homework, which I helped him with, made me realize how much I was missing in school. I recognized the possibility that I would be held back because of my missed time, which would ultimately lead to me loosing my friends (in my mind).   
  This somehow gave me motivation to eat again. Something had clicked and I had decided that I didn't want to die. So I started to eat more. I realized that I was avoiding food because I had a simple but common misconception: If my stomach is empty, I wont be able to vomit anything out.   I nowadays know that this is very much possible and in fact much more painful than emptying a full stomach.   This realization however did not lead me to discard this misconception. It still is, up to this day, even though much less, something that I cannot completely forget.   

  
  Next up was a visit with a psychiatrist, who was supposed to evaluate my state of mind and advice on further treatment. I don’t remember much about that appointment, but the weird fact that he checked my patella reflex (the thing when someone punches you on your knee cap and your leg moves) and of course that he strongly advised my mother to put me into a psychiatric clinic.   This is was a horrible suggestion from my point of view. I would have to leave my parents and there would be no chance of finishing the school year.   

  
  So together with my pediatrician my parents compromised on me visiting a day clinic. Of course this wasn’t fine with me either and I hated going there. I was a child. I just wanted to be normal again.   My time in the day clinic amounted to about two months or so. Of course during this time, basically nothing happened to improve my well being. I got sorted into a few activities including few school classes, but it was basically all bullshit. It just felt like waiting for something to happen. I became more and more depressed with my situation and during this time there I only had one talk with the psychiatrist. This talk was right in the beginning and he basically wanted to put me onto some antidepressants straight away, which made my parents also very skeptic. One thing led to an other and it resulted in an argument with my parents and the psychiatrist and they pulled me out of the day clinic.   

  
  Next stop: Normal therapy sessions with a child psychiatrist. Some of the sessions my mother and even an aunt of mine attended, for others I was alone. The doctor tried to assess who I was and of course what my problems were. He however never came to the diagnosis of me being emetophobic. Instead he diagnosed that I had a manic depression (which I still don’t get to this day). A few other evaluating tests were done. IQ tests, concentration tests etc. Apparently the IQ test, if I remember correctly, came out a little below average. It was claimed that I had concentration difficulties (which there might have been many fucking reasons for, psychological as well as physical,  e.g. still being underweight and constantly tired). And furthermore they said that my ability to remember numbers and stuff like that was above average. 

  
  The sessions went on and I was put on meds either way, with the active substance being opipramol. This stuff is usually described as a tricyclic antidepressant (which it isn’t). But it helped. Even though every time I had to take the liquid drops was a fight against the taste and the fear of vomiting.   Parallel to this I started to attend school again slowly. I had the best class teacher anyone could ask for. She managed everything with the principal, vouching for me and everything. As I had missed the start of learning the second foreign language, which every student has to choose, she even gave me extra lessons in french during breaks so I would catch up. I owe her a lot and I am very grateful.   Firstly, I would only be in school reduced hours, as my therapist claimed everything more would be too much for me. I was extremely motivated to get through the school year and was eventually allowed to move up with my class mates, even though I missed like half of the school year. My grade point average of course significantly decreased to the years before that and every bad grade made me mad at my situation. This somehow sparked an ambition in me, which would later develop to something rather dangerous. The only negative experience I had was not being allowed to attend a schools ski trip. From which I later got to know that a stomach bug was going around during that time and like 50% of the students and teachers caught it. They all had to vomit and some even were collected by there parents early.   

  
  With time I felt better and my fear lost presence in my life, as I also managed to avoid triggering experiences. I was able to attend school regularly again. My parents and the doctor slowly put me off the meds using placebos and I was soon back to a more normal self. I got back into sports and and also into a trading card game (similar to MAGIC The Gathering). For which I regularly attended tournaments in a small shop in our city. During that time I took buses to get to the shop. And for a short time the fear crept back onto me. Being in these buses I feared vomiting and not being able to get out.   

  
  Besides that, and my social interactions in school, I did not have much else going for me. I wasn’t interested in girls or in music (still being pretty young), but in this card game and Lego. I build a lot with Legos. Hours. I would forget everything around me, unfortunately also eating sometimes, planning everything I wanted to do in my head. My mind was occupied and it was great.   In between I had stopped seeing my psychiatrist. I manged to get my grades up (being class best at times with 2 or 3 others) and was fully focused on my future. School became my whole life and good grades gave me the short gratification I longed for. And I have to correct this last sentence. It weren't good grades that gave me this short bliss and rush, it were the best grades. An A- gave me no gratification. I became ultra competitive and overly ambitious regarding grades. I even spend holidays working through the stuff that would be taught to us the following semester. So I very easily slid into the role of being a very good student. Teachers and other students would recognize me as such. And soon they would ask why only wrote an A- in my last exam. I was completely differently measured and judged compared to other 'average' students. I had no real social group I belonged too, but was cool with basically everybody. I guess peopled liked me because I was loyal and also very reliable. They could count on me if they needed help. And I was able to blend in and adept easily at every social atmosphere.   

  
  The very of vomiting wasn't that present anymore. I was still a skinny kid and had problems eating a lot, but I wasn't spending a problematic amount of time thinking about it. I was living life playing this role. I got back into sports at the end of high school. Started playing football (soccer) and also Basketball (which I preferred). In both I also got very competitive. Even though at times it was hard to keep up with sports and school I somehow managed. So approaching the end of high school I realized that I was closer to a perfect grad point average as I would have thought. Remember I have never been an overly smart or intelligent student. I just spend a lot of time studying and dismissed all other possible interests, including human relationships. So my marks often were close to perfect. But in some subjects I lacked skill or something. Still though I got close to the perfect GPA and actually tried to pursue it and eventually got it. I felt like I achieved something incredible (altough 6 other students out of 200 or so manged to do the same). The feeling didn't last long however. It opened every possible door for further education, but I kinda felt like a fraud. It is to mention here, that my parents never pressured me to be a great student, they were always supportive but never really demanding. 

  
  Parallel to getting my high school degree I ended the football season with great success but fucked up my knee later on during basketball. The doctor told me I had a jumper's knee and also some deformation in my kneecap, which basically meant that I couldn't play basketball any longer if I wanted the pain and lack of mobility in my knee to go away. 

  
  So sport as a balancing component to my life was gone. I focused on university. It was clear that I would either study physics (because maths and physics were my strongest subjects and my teachers urged me to do so) or medicine (because I could easily get into it with my GPA). Physics it was. Hpyer-motivated, incredibly inexperienced and stupid as I was, I even thought I could study both in parallel but would start with physics to see how it went. I know...   I had noone to help me with these decisions or guide me through it. I was the first person in my family that even qualified to study at a university. But I did have one guy from school who also decided on studying physics (we went on doing everything together and became pretty close friends out of convenience). 

  
  So let me skip a little quicker through my time in university (at least the Bachelor time). It basically killed me. The sheer volume was just so much more than school was that I was completely overstrained. I soon was bitch slapped back to reality. My marks went down. I was no longer close to being 'perfect' and thoughts of just bailing on everything did rise in my mind. Which of course I couldn't do because of my stubborn and pathological ambitions.   My student life did not include partying and drinking. My student life was studying like 12 hours a day. And of course also the days in school had been shorter compared to these. I got extremely tired during  the days. And this is when the emetophobia crept back into my life. I wouldn't go to the canteen during my bachelor time. Simply because I often choose a very tight schedule and because eating there would just stress me out. I felt observed and of course I had the fear of vomiting in university.   

  
  I went to my fathers family doctor (who knew nothing about my past) and he basically just told me I should try to eat more in order to get over this tiredness. I somehow compromised and started to make time in my schedule to eat something that I brought with me. I pulled through my bachelor (as I always did) was able to write my thesis in a field that had little to do with physics and got my degree with a B and finished in the standard 6 semesters .   

  
  Instead of stopping here and pursuing something else in life, I continued with my master studies. Everyone encouraged me to do, as a simple bachelor degree in physics wasn't worth anything.   The first semester continued just like the last bachelor semester. But during the semester brake another (and to this day last) vomiting incident happened.   

  
  It was a horrible summer day for me. I ate lunch (a large one in my opinion) pretty late at around 3 p.m.. Around that time I had an argument with my mother, as I asked her if she thought that I was still to skinny and she told me that I could definitely gain more weight. Which made me extremely mad. And out of spite I ate an other chocolate bar. I was stuffed. But this wasn't a problem an average human being could not handle.   However I decided  to play my second round of Day-Z (which was basically PUBG back in the day). The game was extremely intense for me and gave me an adrenaline rush, also making me somewhat nauseous because of the style you have to play it. So after finishing the game I started to panic. I couldn't really talk to my mother because were still fighting and it was extremely hot outside. So I tried to calm me down. I went to the toilet to have bowl movement. After that I felt something at the back of my throat. It was some kind of fluid. And right after that I started to gag. As I know now this can happened if you are about to vomit to protect your throat and teeth from being damaged by the stomach acid.   So I full blown panicked and I ran to parents. They realized the situation and the fight was forgotten. They tried to calm me down but I was to far in it. So I sat down on the couch in the living room with a bucket and a blanket. And as if the world was conspiring against me a full blown thunderstorm started to gather outside. The air pressure changed immediately. And I vomited. I think 2 or 3 times. I remember the feeling right after was extreme relieve. But if picture the feeling of vomiting right now I cannot picture this relieve. My father actually said that now I would never again would have problems with vomiting again and he was extremely sincere about it. At first I thought I managed it well. I even went to a barbecue party the following weekend. But after that I entered a rapid downward spiral. Everything was back to square one. I was afraid to eat. I was afraid to be left alone. I was afraid to go anywhere. It was horrible.   

  
  I managed to pull threw it somehow getting through my master studies. But I developed a serious fear of exams. Something I never had before. I was never able to eat before exams (but this was normal for me), as I were in an extremely concentrated but tense state of mind. However now the nausea before exams dominated. I was so afraid that I had to vomit during exams, that I would position myself closest to an exit as possible, just in case I had to run out. I scanned the room for bins I could vomit into, just like I did all these years back. Of course this lead to an decrease in my marks. But I no longer cared about that. I just wanted to pass and be done with it. So the last exam I had to write was another breaking point for me.   I got noticed that I failed the exam by 0.5 points (however this information was without any guarantee as it came from my tutor). I could not believe it. I had such a good feeling. But this broke me. The idea that I had to write an other exam and possible add whole semester two my studies was mortifying for me. I just wanted to go on and write my thesis and be done with all the pressure. So I got this notification on a Friday and would be sure about it until Monday, spending the whole weekend in the void of my mind. I remember taking a walk through the forest, crying, while it started to rain. I didn't turn back. I just kept going. For hours I walked to the forest until I reached some tree that caught my attention and the thought of killing myself popped into my head. I realized this as soon as it happened and I started crying even more. I were so overwhelmed by my feelings that I didn't know what to do.   

  
  The monday came and I went to university to take a look at my marked exam. Indeed 0.5 points were missing. But also the whole last task (which gave like 30% of the points) was graded with 0 points because I apparently missed the question (which I totally disagree with to this day, but was way to tired to argue about it.). Anyway I noticed something else. I had written a correct equation down which was also graded with 0 points by my own tutor. So I was visibly confused and talked to the professor. He firstly said the equation was wrong and wrote down the 'correct' one, which was the same fucking equation that I wrote, but inverted. I straight up told him that got 2 points for it and passed the exam.   I don't know what would have happened if this hadn't worked and I had failed.   Besides all that crap I definitely realized that I was severely fucked up in my head. 

  
   So this time I decided on my own that I needed help. So first off I made and appointment with my mothers family doctor, who gave me a prescription for Venlafaxine. So in the morning before I was heading out for university I took the pill. And it basically knocked me the fuck out. I got so dizzy that my only fear once again was vomiting. This feeling passed eventually but I decided I would never take that stuff again.   
  After that I called a psychiatrists and eventually got an appointment with a doctor. I told him everything about my situation and asked if it was possible for him to prescribe me opipramol (the drug that I took as kid) as I knew that I almost had no side effects taking them. So he did. And I still take 100mg each day.   I started therapy soon after. Cognitive behavioral therapy. And I didn't wait for diagnosis. I straight up told her I had emetophobia and had developed severe OCD over the years in University, which I only later recognized as such.   
  Maybe it is important to mention that a few months before I got therapy my mother actually got therapy as well. She had developed a fear of suffocation and swallowing. So this maybe also influenced my state of mind.     
  My OCD was primarily a nightly routine thing but also included carrying medication against nausea, a bag, a bottle of water. Of course it also included obsessive hand washing rituals and many many more.     
  Anyway, as the therapy went on, I slowly managed to get rid of my OCD. I had developed a rather strict eating plan. As my fear drastically expanded from only fearing nausea and vomiting to a fear that I would loose all the weight I gained possibly going back to being a hospital case.   

  
So I still, to this day follow this eating plan: 

Breakfast (usually straight after I wake up): 1 slice of whole grain bread, 1 slice of whole grain crispbread with butter and smoked ham 

11:00: Fruit-salad with walnuts and quark.   

13:00: Lunch (differs)   16:00: Some bakery sweet stuff or chocolate bar   

18:00: Dinner (same size as lunch approx.)  

 21:00: Ice cream (Gelato) with almonds  

 23:00: Oatmeal nut cereal   

  
  So basically I eat 7 meals a day. I have been told this is rather healthy and what I eat yields a balanced nutrition for my body.   In therapy I of course also worked on being more flexible regarding my eating habits. Nowadays I manage to leave a meal or two completely out of my routine, or just eat at different times. However this my standard construct.   At times I still feel very stressed when I have to eat out or with people I am not particularly close with. But overall the therapy improved my life significantly even though I would describe it as a very bumpy road.     
  Parallel to therapy I finished my master's degree in the regular 4 semesters. I wrote my master thesis in the same group that I wrote my bachelor's thesis in. And managed to have a GPA equivalent to a B+ as I managed to get an A in my thesis.     
  I was functioning again. Everything got better and I was starting to enjoy life. I got offered a PhD position in the same group which I of course took. So currently I am in the second year of my PhD.     
  My PhD studies challenged me and my fear on other levels. Attending conferences was a normal thing. But I hadn't flown in years and was extremely afraid that I couldn't pursue my eating habits on those conferences. But I managed and in my first year I attended 4 conferences. Including a bigger one in the US. Which was to this point the biggest challenge for me. A 12 hour flight. Eating in a plane. Not getting enough sleep. Basically being awake for 24 hours. Arriving in a country that is known for its rather 'dead' calorie food.     
  But I got through it and I did well. I survived and I grew on it. The individual experiences there weren't great at all but from the trip as a whole I gained a lot.     
  My therapist agreed with me on that and I got more confident with myself. During my master thesis I had picked back up playing basketball. My body was no longer skinny but rather athletic. And I decided that it was time for me to have sex. (I know. What a weird transition.) 

  
  Of course I always had that urge, but I lacked time and also confidence. Both of which I had now.   So I went on tinder (classical). I got a few matches and wrote with a few women. But one in particular sparked my interest. We were completely honest with each other from the start, which was extremely refreshing for me. I told her about my emetophobia and that I had no experience with women whatsoever (besides some sexting). She was not repelled by it but rather intrigued. We wrote a lot and had some dates. At the end of one date she eventually had kissed me. Which was great. But I had developed feelings. And she basically was just interested in sex. At first. I was honest about that too and told her that I didn't think this would work for me. I didn't want this to be a fuckbuddy thing. So right before we were about to have sex I explained myself to her and asked her to decide if she wanted to try going for what we had or she could just end this here (which I was totally cool with and I wouldn't be mad about it). And then I left, which apparently impressed her. She agreed on not seeing anybody else, which was fine for me at that time. We eventually slept together and it was kinda as I expected. She said that I didn't act like a virgin, which was mainly due to me being so confident at that time. I had nothing to loose. So we grew closer and closer and saw each other every weekend. We even went on a holiday trip together. Which was also a great time overall, even though it was very exhausting. I managed extremely well with my eating and almost spend no thought on vomiting or nausea. Up to our last day. I kinda felt a little weird and focused on that feeling (it was basically just gas and nothing serious). As it had to happened on that day we saw a boy vomiting next to a bin in brought daylight. I had a serious laugh about that. I felt like the universe was communicating with me. Like offering me a way back to my old self. Something like a test. The feeling passed eventually later that day. Since my now girlfriend is a very restless person and constantly making plans we actually did do a lot of things. Going onto concerts, eating out and similar stuff. My experience of life increased drastically in the sense that I was experience more. In a lot of cases I wasn't even entertained by the things that we were doing but I still enjoyed her being happy a lot and was grateful for the experience. 

  
  Eventually I was feeling so well that I decided to get off my meds. My girlfriend surely played a vital role in that. So I talked to my therapist and my doctor an we all agreed that I would slowly get off the meds. The process as such was doable. My stress increased during that time for multiple reasons, but I definitely realized that I started to feel worse (even though I didn't want to admit it during that time). I pulled through it and was eventually drug free. Things didn't really change that much except for me having more negative thoughts again.   I had previously described this to my therapist as non-problematic, as I felt I was on like 130%-happiness while being on my medication and that a possible 80%-happiness off my meds would still be worth it.   My Doctor, my therapist and myself however underestimated the positive influence the medication had on me.   So it was bound to happen that during a regular night I kinda crashed with my stress-level overflowing. I had just finished my last meal for the day as I started to feel nauseous. Even though I tried for like an hour to shake the thought I wasn't able to do it and eventually started to panic. I woke my mother and explained myself, that I feared throwing up and needed help. So she comforted me like back in the days I took an anti-vomiting pill and fell asleep.     
  This reopened certain gates. Very similar to the last time that I actually vomited. I started to get worse, had a lot more of these incidents and eventually decided together with my doctor that I would start taking the medication again (a decision that my parents this time very much promoted).     
  In a turn of events my girlfriend and I realized that she also had an eating disorder. She was already in therapy because of other complex stuff but I don't want to go to much into detail about how she developed he eating-disorder. As I started to feel better again she started to feel worse. She showed very strange behaviour in many aspects of her life (as she had before, but now I recognized it), like not being able to call in sick because she felt way to responsible about things that were happening in her workplace and she feared that she'd loose the affection and recognition of her colleagues. I eventually was able to reassure that it was okay to miss work and work on her mental health. So after a serious breakdown that she had we went to her doctor and paved they way for her to visit a clinic. This was happening around the start of corona in my country. So she additionally had to miss work as a part of the government regulations and was confronted with her problems even more.   

  
  This all was stressing me massively. I wanted to help her as much as I could but this of course led to me neglecting working on my own problems. I wasn't making much progress but was on a solid level regarding my fear and facing it on a daily basis.     
  I eventually talked to my therapist about me fearing that I would never totally get over my emetophobia. She had no real answer for me on this. She believed that I would definitely get better but she wasn't able to tell me if there is a complete way out of it.     
  So I kinda took things into my own hand and started reading a lot of scientific papers on the matter of emetophobia. Besides that I tried looking into other platforms like youtube or reddit in order to find the one person that claims to have gone past this phobia.     
  What I found is very discouraging in general. The scientific papers report on improvements regarding emetophobia, but not even one of the patients claimed that they are cured and the phobia is gone.   

  
  This is something that makes me extremely sad. I know that my life can improve and that even with emetophobia I can have good life, but I want to live the best possible life that I could live. And even with all these improvements I know that I can always crash again, like I have so many times. I am just exhausted. 

  
  I eventually found something called 'The Thrive Programme'. Which is basically an instruction of how to get rid of emetophobia. There is a huge amount of sponsored videos from persons who claim that they made it past emetophobia using this program. I am very critical about it but still bought the book and went through it. It convinced me in some parts and others I found to be very naive. Anyway I found no external source that confirmed the success rate of this program. So I kinda stopped pursuing it once I went through the book (which the author of course claims to be the biggest mistake). 

  
  And so it happened again. The corona restrictions were reduced and I had to be present in the office again. This was once again a huge problem because I had relaxed in my state of being. I was able to eat regularly and at the times that I wanted. This is not always possible when I am in the office and just thinking of that stresses me so much that I developed physical symptoms.  These mostly included nausea but also some kind of diarrhea. Almost every morning my bowl just felt like it had to completely empty itself and I have not much control over it.     
  So these symptoms come and go depending on my level of stress and it eventually got better again. I feel like I am lacking the stamina to confront myself again with huge new things that trigger my fear, but I still do it.   

  
  Then my girlfriend confronted me again. She had criticized me for my limitations regarding this fear before. This time however it was shocking to me. She basically claimed that I am living in a cage and then I am not doing enough to get rid of the emetophobia. This has hurt me extremely and just happened recently (way after I started writing all this). She claims that she is doing all that out of love for me and she knows that it is wrong but she can't help herself.   So I have thought a lot about ending the relationship, simply because I don't feel like can be comfortable around her anymore if I had an other anxiety attack around her. Of course our fight is much more complex then this. But this is the main takeaway. 

  
  I am now at a point in my life were I want clarity about my future. But I would like to know what my possibilities are. Is it possible to ever completely get rid of this fear and view it like distant memory or do I have to accept my fate here and live through the ups and downs of this phobia. 

  
  So basically my questions are: What am I supposed to do know? I don't have anything up sleeve and feel completely vulnerable. Is there any person who has overcome this phobia? If so how?   What am I missing in my life? Were did it all go wrong? Why am I constantly rebounding in these miserable states.

175,"i've already submitted this exact post to the anxiety forum but i'll put it here too because i really want to know peoples experiences.  i've been on klonopin since 15/16, and i'm 20 now. my dr recently raised the dosage to an amount without causing ""potential addiction"" because i've obviously formed a tolerance at this point. how do you feel after years of taking it? do you also feel clumsy, slow-ish, fatigued, blurred vision, and just over-all like your brain cells are ""dying out""? it's hard to tell when it's my mental illnesses causing me issues or when it's the medication. maybe both. i've always taken klonopin as prescribed but i don't think i can live without it, nothing else helps with my anxiety like it does, but i know it's not even meant for long term use, yet here i am. how has it made you feel in the long run? what side effects do you experience? do you think you can go without it? or were you able to stop using it completely? it still helps with my anxiety which is why i still take it, and my doctors are aware that it's been too long at this point, so my dr's goal is to have my SSRI (prozac) start helping with my anxiety so i can wean off of klonopin, but just thinking about not having it available scares me since it was always there for me through the years",19Jun2020,1
176,"(this is just something I've realized regarding myself, but I thought I'd share for anyone who may be in a similar situation)

since my mental health struggles began, I (and probably my family and my treatment team) have been in search for an explanation. why did I spiral downhill? what diagnosis could explain why I am the way I am? why do I do the things I do? what happened to cause this?

for years, I took those online tests that just tell you that you should see a doctor - for autism, for personality disorders, for ADHD... probably every diagnosis out there, I've read about it. I spent time reading the respective subreddits and immersed myself in those communities hoping that maybe - just maybe - I could find an answer..

I read posts from people who would say things like: *I read the symptom list for ADHD and it feels like someone was spying on me when they wrote it.* I'm really glad those people have an explanation. I can't imagine what that feels like, though. 

but that selfish, rotten part of me always wishes I had something like that - a label that fit me perfectly and described many of the struggles in my life, with a community of people who could relate to me. 

none of that changes what I'm going through, but I guess I've found a bit of peace in ceasing my chase to find that answer that doesn't exist.",19Jun2020,1
177,"so it was 12am when i wished my uncle happy birthday and got ready for bed until my mom sent me a picture. curious, i opened it. of course, it was a picture of me from a few years ago when i was 12 (i'm 15 now) when i had really bad posture. my back was hunched but my stomach was like pushed forward (it's hard to explain but trust me, it was a really really really unflattering position). i looked so bad holy shit i just want to personally apologize to everyone i met back then because of how awful i looked. to top it all off, my mom captioned the picture with ""oh wow look at the way you stand"" as if i hadn't realized how horrible my posture was. it still is but i'm working on it. i honestly didn't know how to feel anymore but before i knew it, i bawled my fucking eyes out. like i know she meant for the photo to be inspiring to me, so that i would finally be able to have a proper posture or something but it just reminded me of a really dark time in my life. they never thought about *what* made me have that bad of a posture, to have the shittiest confidence ever or to suddenly be so quiet (everyone always said that i was a really loud kid but around 4th grade, i just became so quiet). it was my fucking family. they would just tear my confidence apart. ""are you sure you want to eat that?"", ""you know, you would be a lot prettier if you lost just a liiiittleee bit of weight."". my family is chinese so they believed in the chinese zodiac and there were quite a lot of monkeys in my family and my aunt made this story about this hierarchy of the monkeys in my family and i was at the bottom of the hierarchy, she said i was 'scraping the other monkey's waste'. she would repeat that story at family dinners, family parties, car rides, and fucking chinese new year. i was fucking nine. i know you're not supposed to take what someone said into your heart or whatever but i was nine and my aunt (who i was taught to trust) said that. 

i've tried working on my posture but everytime i tried standing up straight, it just didn't feel right. it felt like im not worthy of standing up straight because i feel like am worthless. i've even had problems with my voice. like i would speak so softly nobody could hear me because i didn't think people actually cared about my opinion like i didn't feel worthy of voicing my opinion to other people. i have to admit i have definitely made some progress over the past few years but i still don't feel worthy of standing up straight and i still think that people wouldn't care about my opinion. i have been very lucky to meet my friends and they've helped me through numerous occasions, they made me realize that oh, people actually do care about me. but i realized that i still have a lot to work on and that only i can change my horrible view of myself (if that makes sense). anyway i just wanted to like share this with someone because i have never talked about this before and it definitely helped so yeah. any advice would be appreciated and sorry if my english is weird because its not my first language. .

180,"Hello, I am a random person, and for the past 3 months I haven't been able to leave my bed for anything besides occasional work, meals, and bathroom. I've slowly lost my appetite and normally only eat about half a sandwich to one meal every day. i want to find the motivation to leave my bed, i want to be inspired by something to make me want to go out into the world and face it on my own, but sadly i cannot find anything, having an opposite effect to where i just want to leave society and live as a wandering soul. It is as if nothing interests me, and therefore i cannot find any form of potential purpose in my being. I am void of emotion except discontent, without the slightest clue of what path to take in my life, and it paralyzes me. Speaking with my family is difficult as they try to force their religion on me at every chance they get, which i have no affiliation to anymore. In my life currently I have one friend who will be gone for the next several years in the military and is too entrenched in his own issues i cant bring up my own, and one ""friend"" who, imo, only keeps me around to try and make himself ""look better"", only wants to do what he wants and whenever i invite him to do something he will flake at the last moment, to the point where i've come to expect it. To cope with the emotional and mental anguish i find myself in, i've developed an unhealthy dependence to rather recreational substances, and no matter what ive tried to do i always end up going back. Its almost become a part of my personality. I feel like I am at a crossroads in my life and know what can be done, but i need the motivation to do so. What can be said to help me through this time, or to help me find motivation in life?

183,"So during this isolation I feel that my stress levels are really low. Over past weeks I started to have some flashbacks from my childhood and teenage years. It’s quite scary as I feel like I was sleepwalking through all these years. As if my brain was constantly blocking most memories. As memories are coming back I’m trying to understand what I actually was/am now. It’s not like I’m suddenly a different person, but I feel like I don’t know who I am anymore. 

Some context: I’m 21 years old, gay, grew up in a really homophobic country before I moved to UK.
Last year my roommate committed suicide after which I felt really numb and depressed for about a year.
I was suicidal in high school and have social anxiety which may have contributed to this as well

I don’t know how to get thru life anymore . I’m pushing everyone away that I’m close to. No one. Even this guy that was like in love with me. Even him. I can tell they don’t want to hear it anymore. Of course I’ve thought of ending my life now because at least I could go and escape these thoughts. But I think of my family especially my dad and sister and I can’t . My mom would be so sad but I think she would get thru it ok. 

I can’t stop looking at other people. How their lives are so normal . I do remember a time I liked life . However I remember and can’t forget all the terrible things I’ve done . I can’t let it go. My family and the couple friends I have left are tired of it. They miss the old fun me and so do I . They want me to stop complaining, stop making life all about me but I don’t stop . I remind myself of my elderly aunt who’s in a nursing home . She was so negative and also hide from life. I’m just doing it at a younger age then her. There was a time she was successful and so smart . Now she’s living her life in a nursing home and I haven’t had much contact with her for years and years . She was always there for me but I was never there for her . I wasn’t there for a lot of people and it haunts me. I lay awake not able to sleep and I lay and crack my jaw over and over again . I live my life strangely but there was a time I had such great opportunities and I had hope but I ruined my life with bipolar ,drugs and horrible choices. I also was a really shitty person and have gotten I cannot have a baby I’m almost 42 old as you get older people don’t care as much. I had a chance to be in groups like AA:NA I ruined that every time . By complaining and being negative I feel so scared to return. I’m scared people won’t welcome me as they did before .",19Jun2020,1

I enjoy makeup the most but was willing to learn other things to further pursue my future career. I had already attended some beauty school in the past but had to drop out due to my declining mental health &amp; being harassed at school. I was on my way recently to reenroll and discovered that they now background check in PA for the state board test to receive your license. Going back to 4 years ago when I was 19, 2 of my friends at the time and I were jumped by a large group of people. The cops came to my house next day to tell me I would be having a court summons sent to my house and I tried to explain the situation but since they said that they only saw me the day after and night the night of that they were taking the opposing parties side and then discovered one of their household members was calling the cops behind the scenes as the fight was happening. That led me to go to court and I couldn’t afford a lawyer at the time because I was only making 8.75$ an hour. They MADE me plead guilty to simple assault and harassment charges as well as disorderly conduct and told me I couldn’t even defend myself even though this was my first ever offense. They made me pay a 500$ fine in full. So now I discovered the state board can and most likely will turn me away from my license. So I have to withdraw from school. I am destroyed .. it’s already impossible to find a full time job as is. Everyone views me as a criminal/monster even though I am nothing like that. I do suffer from mental illness such as PTSD, BPD, OCD, ADHD, depression, anxiety. I do have a part time job but with very limited hours , I’m currently still laid off from it due to the virus.

203,"Today wasn't a good day, for no particular reason. I didn't do anything special, woke up and ate breakfast, played a game. I even got motivated to make a workout plan, so I did and exercised + showered. No friends had messaged me yet and my partner was busy, so I decided to watch anime. At this point my mood switched and I was not happy or relaxed. My mother asked for my help outside, to which I asked if she ""had to do it today?"". I didn't want to directly refuse, but before I could explain that I wasn't feeling good she made me feel very guilty about my reply. I hadn't told her no, but she gave me no time to elaborate on it. This made me extra sad, and because of this I've been in my bed for nearly 4 hours crying.

This isn't the first time I've gotten extremely emotional over something stupid like this, but it's starting to get to me. Last time I had this long of a cry, I felt invalid and fake (which I still do).
I saw a psychiatrist for nearly a year after I had a number of panic attacks in public, but didn't get diagnosed with anything specific. ""You have more 'problems' than the average person but it doesn't affect you enough to set a diagnosis"". Since my visits ended I've been thinking a lot and I'm not sure if I'm faking things or not. What if I'm just lying to myself that I have problems but I'm perfectly fine? It seems to be possible. Even making this post seems like a cry for attention. I am thinking that making this means I'm only making up things. I sucked up courage to tell someone some weeks ago about self doubt and invalidating myself, and was told those were signs of depression, but I can't have that... my psychiatrist said I didn't.

There are a million things I could say, but I don't think a long post is going to do anything. It's probably the wrong subreddit too, please correct me if it is. I have not told anyone of my worries today as I don't want to create fake pity. Please excuse me.",19Jun2020,1

205,"A month ago I had a bike accident (I had six stitches in my face) and I tried to return to work sooner than anticipated (I'm a teacher working from home regularly).

The entire accident and aftermath has been horrible. My only parent passed last year, so the accident brought up a lot of the grief. I'm also upset about the scarring (27F). I am single and because of the pandemic, people are still social distancing too. Feeling pretty alone.

It's been isolating. I was up north with my brother and his family for the first few days after my accident, but I returned to my city as all of my appointments were here. I've had a few friends stop by... and thankfully I have a cat for company, but I'm still bummed.

I feel ugly because of the scarring. It's above my lip and on my chin. I've never had a head injury before either, so lately I noticed ringing in my ears and a really bad headache. I tried to resume my normal lifestyle as much as possible after the accident.

I'm going to see my doctor in office next Tuesday, hopefully for a proper assessment. I've had appointments for various things, but I haven't had a proper neurological exam since the accident. My chiropractor did a small neuro exam and my eyes were unable to focus or follow properly - yikes. I've also cried hysterically (a combination of pain/headache/frustration).

So I'm left feeling isolated, bored, lonely. I had to give up my July job (summer school) and my doctor said no exercise, avoid sunlight.. etc. for now. So I've been sitting in my basement with the blinds closed. It feels hopeless with no resolution in sight.

206,"So when I look back to when I was younger I remember being a weird kid. Not too sure if these mean anything but I just feel like venting about it. Here’s what I experienced. This might be triggering/ nsfw.

I have a really good imagination, but sometimes I would scare myself with it. For example, between the ages of 6-8 I would sometimes see shadow figures right before I went to bed.I also remember watching doctor who and being terrified by one of the aliens. Later that week I saw one outside of my window, it stared at me and then it ducked, it scared me so much that i can recall it so clearly. I would also mistake hanging clothes as people or faces.
When I went to the toilet as a kid I would have to push the cupboards door shut because I felt like something was watching from it (i still deal with the feeling of being watched, especially from hidden cameras, from time to time)
I was very shy and lacked confidence. I have so many cringe memories from awkward situations that I put myself in as a kid.
I found it hard to concentrate in school, no teachers noticed as I was the quiet kid and it wasn’t like I was disturbing the class. I would always day dream.
When I was younger I self diagnosed myself with Parkinson’s disease for like 2 days, I never told anyone though. I’ve done this before with other health issues but none of them were that extreme.
I feel like I had a big ego as well as having very low self esteem as a kid. Like I thought I was special, like Jesus or something, even though I wasn’t that religious. At one point in time I remember trying to train my brain to do telekinesis. I was also a depressed kid, I had very little interests, and I still feel depressed now.
Sometimes I feel like people are watching and judging my actions.
I used to hide in the corner of my room when getting changed in case something was watching from a different corner of my room. Like a ghost or something.
I don’t put much effort into my relationships with my friends.
I also used to lie a lot, but I guess most kids do that anyways.
I’ve always found it hard to trust people and I can’t open up to people
I had suicidal thoughts, tried to starve myself, and did self harm as a preteen.
I think one main reason to why I’m venting about this is because I’ve never felt right. I’ve never felt like I could properly relate to anyone. Because of this I always felt lonely as a kid and still do now.

208,"I've only posted once on reddit so I don't know if I'm typing anything out right (or there's a specific way to type at all) but I just wanted to share today!

I've had a rough evening today (which I'm not going to get into right now as I want to keep my good mood) and my thoughts after what happened just seemed really loud as they seem to be lately. I'm not really one for walks or going outside - especially during this time. But I thought I might as well as it's the evening and there wouldn't be many people around.

Initially I just wanted to get out of the house and get lost in self pity and sad thoughts but as I left I thought I might as well get something good out of my rare moment outside. And it went so well!

My mind was clearer then I have ever remembered at this point. And I was noticing things about my neighborhood that I never had before, despite living here all my life. Subtle things like the different shades of green in the bushes, the way the flowers somewhat matched the colour of the sky, or how the two trees outside my house faintly resembled a heart (they didn't really I just like to think so!)

For about 20 minutes or so I just sat on a swing in the park, swinging back and forth, going around in small circles, and just sitting there listening to my music and the various nature sound that got through my headphones. The dull lighting that you get just before a sunset was so relaxing and, despite having a sad smile on my face the sad thoughts didn't accompany it.

It most probably doesn't mean much to a lot of people but it really helped me today. I feel like it's common knowledge that walks are supposed to help your mental health but I didn't know how much it really did until I felt it myself.

The only regret I have is leaving without telling my mother as she was still upset about earlier that evening. But after reassuring her I was fine and wasn't going to do anything reckless it was really enjoyable.

I'm sorry for droning on about this but it really did make me feel so much better - as I've said many times at this point.

I hope anyone who read to this is doing well. To those who aren't doing too well, I hope you have a great day and know you can get through the rough patch you're currently in, no matter how big or small. And those doing well, I hope you get even better then you currently are! :)",19Jun2020,2

211,"I’m not sure if this is the right place for this, but as the title says I am desperate. If it’s relevant, I have diagnosed bipolar II and anxiety. 

I’m 25 now and a girl, but when I was 21 I went on the site Omegle which I frequently visited to talk to people, especially when I was feeling crappy. I met a guy on there who was 17 and also feeling crappy. I should mention I live in Canada and he lived in America.  His life experiences made me very sad and I offered him time to vent and gave whatever advice/encouragement I could think of. He asked to add me on Facebook in case he ever needed to talk. He messaged me often and it became clear he had a crush on me and would send flirtatious messages. Especially in the beginning, I would brush it off or ignore it and say something else. He would get offended/upset at times so eventually I started reciprocating. I now feel sick about this. For reference, the age of consent where I live is 16, and it’s gross I even feel like I have to mention that. He never sent me any inappropriate photos or videos, nor did he say anything particularly explicit, but some suggestive things were said and I’d sometimes just go along with it because he was so self hating and I didn’t want to contribute to it. I eventually just got too comfortable with the flirtations because we became quite good friends and I’d react/initiate the same way I did with my other friends who flirted with me, and I shouldn’t have. I felt pressured to be a good person and be there for him but I should’ve drawn the line. I guess I thought because he lived far away and was over the consent age it wasn’t an issue, I never even thought about it that way because I’m stupid. I referred to us as friends often, and I know he agreed but I also know he still liked me more than that. 

He was obviously aware we weren’t dating and we both dated other people during the 2 year period we were friends, but he would get upset especially in the beginning if he found out I went on a date or something like that. Eventually, our lives just got very busy/different and we stopped talking much. I barely ever thought of him until about 5 days ago and I didn’t really remember the content of the messages until I went back to read them and now I hate myself. I feel gross and creepy. I’m disgusted at my past self for talking like that to someone who’s under 18. I can tell from reading how I spoke that my maturity has developed a lot, but still. I have never done anything else like that nor would I do it at this age (although I shouldn’t have at that age). I suffer from anxiety and have been feeling ill for the past 6 days over this. My anxiety also has me paranoid about being charged. I recently reached out to him (he’s now 21 himself) to ask if he’d delete the messages because I feel so ashamed of them existing in the world, and he said that made him sad but he would delete them. Now I’m paranoid that maybe he didn’t. My friends tell me I‘m over-reacting about all this but I truly don’t feel like it. 

One of my big concerns right now is that everything I read online tells me people in their 20s who talk to or flirt with 17 year olds are creepy and gross and honestly I agree but I did it myself and I’m so ashamed and anxious about this. I keep reading about celebrities being outed for assaulting 17 year olds or for grooming and I get triggered reading it because I associate myself with that and I feel like such a bad person, but I have no right to be triggered by something like that when it never happened to me, it feels wrong and just makes me feel more like a bad person. I feel like I committed a heinous immoral crime. I obviously agree that grooming and being predatory are bad, but I feel like I have no right to think that even though I know (and my therapist has reassured me) that it isn’t at all what I’ve done. To add to this, I can barely watch anything. If I watch a YouTube video or a show and they condemn someone for doing something wrong or bad (even something small) I feel like it’s attacking me.

215,"So hi, I’m not really sure if this is the right place to post this, but google isn’t really helping me find answers of what might be causing this so here I am. 

Over the past few months I’ve been having increasing incidences of seeing things out of the corner of my eye move, but when I look there’s nothing that could have moved. I often sit alone in my room reading or listening to music and have no pets. Often times it is coupled with the sensation of something crawling on my toes, leg, arm, or face. 

At first I chalked it up to bugs cause I live somewhat in the south of the US so it’s kind of common place to see a roach every now and then, but I’ve never actually seen any bugs in my room. Closest I have is, like I said, seen something move out of the corner of my eye. 

I suffer from mild depression which I go to therapy for, but could this be a warning sign of something mentally or physically wrong with me? I’ve very healthy otherwise; I am 22, I eat well, live cleanly, work out regularly, have 20/20 vision, and work hard to take care of myself. 

The only adverse things I can think of are that I have trouble sleeping (I usually get 6-8 hours every 24 hours, but I don’t really have a schedule, it’s just whenever I can manage to fall asleep), and I drink quite frequently. I rarely drink to the point of getting a hangover the day after or blacking out, but it does help me sleep. 

If you know any other subs I could find answers in that would be great. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Hopefully I can find some answers. I just worry I might lose my job even though it’s not critical that I’m 100% a-okay.",19Jun2020,1
216,"After a while of questioning this I've decided to join Reddit in hope that maybe I can find an answer from someone with similar experiences to my own.

To start this off, I'm a fourteen year old with a history of mental health issues. Since I was about 10 years old or so, I've developed things like depression and a severe case of anxiety, along with an autism diagnosis which I believe could be a bit of a factor to these things. After a suicide attempt and multiple appointments with my GP, I've been prescribed a high dosage of antidepressants which I believe has finally given me more stability with my moods, and since then I've been experiencing more positivity than I used to.

But now that I'm getting treatment for that, I think that there's more to it than just my depression. For years I've had a very unstable and shifting self-image; my personality seems to be sort of all over the place as if it's fragmented and I often lose my sense of being. Looking at my reflection in the mirror becomes scary, I see the person in front of me and think 'is that me?' because what I'm seeing feels wrong, out of place. My mind doesn't seem to register that it's really me I'm looking at. And it's not just in the mirror. I usually feel disconnected from my own actions as if I'm watching it all play out but I'm not there *mentally*. It's like some kind of mental fog and my brain feels hazy. 

When I find a character I like from a certain source, such as a movie or series I'm interested in, I tend to grow unhealthily attached to them and my identity kinda morphs into theirs, as if I've become just like them. Sometimes I experience gender dysphoria or dissatisfaction with things related to myself, like my name, because it feels wrong, as if it's not actually me. And when this happens seeing my own body and face makes me feel disoriented, confused. I'm always changing my gender identity, my chosen name, my behaviour, and my appearance because of it. And I'm sick of whatever it is. It confuses everyone around me and I break down because of the fact that I really don't know who I am anymore, and how I've lost some of my closest friends since it's started.

I'm not sure if it's normal, if it's just a sign of my depression or another problem which hasn't yet been addressed with my doctors. An armchair diagnosis isn't what I aim to get here, but to anyone who does see this post -- I'd really appreciate your thoughts. And I'm hoping that maybe someone can relate and share what they think about it. Thanks :)",19Jun2020,1
217,"Hi my name's Tyler iv been dealing with anxiety and depression for years but I'm getting my breaking point.Iv been having thoughts that are very disturbing  and vile constantly.I also think I mite be hearing voices,does any was have this?",19Jun2020,3
218,"Hi Guys,

For some background information: I have been diagnosed with GAD and OCD. I currently see a therapist once a week and a psychiatrist around once a month. I had a really bad case of schizOCD a few months ago where I would monitor my thoughts and try to look out for paranoia, hallucinations, etc. During this time, I would get thoughts that my significant other was cheating, even though I know that it's not based in reality. For example, if I would read a post online from someone and it mentioned their boyfriend, a thought would pop into my head like, ""what if this person is talking about my partner?"" If I would watch porn and the male didn't show his face, I would think, ""what if this is my boyfriend?"" I understand these are incredibly irrational thoughts. But I then became distressed that this signaled I was in the beginning stages of schizophrenia. My doctor upped my SSRI dosage and monitoring my thoughts have subsided. 

However, yesterday and today, I have gotten jealous thoughts about my significant other. I know they're insane, but they are causing me distress that I am going into psychosis or that I have something like a personality disorder. My partner and I live with my parents and my mom is very attractive. My mom was laughing with my partner, and I got this twinge of jealousy. WHICH IS SO WEIRD! I completely trust my mom and my partner 100%, but I still got jealous! I get these dumb, ""what if mom is flirting with him,"" even though that thought is SUPER crazy. Today, my partner went into work and didn't wear his scrubs in (which he usually does). I began to think, ""what if he's going to another girl's house?"" or ""what if he's going on a date?"" I feel like I overthink everything and I joke with him that he's cheating on me instead of in at work but it's more my way of asking for reassurance.

My question is does anyone else suffer from this? Can this jealousy be rooted in insecurity and anxiety, or do people think it's something more serious? I have a psychiatrist appointment in July and I will be telling him these symptoms, should I try to reach out to him sooner than that? Do people think this is an emergency symptom?",19Jun2020,1
219,"If you suffer from any kind of anxiety, you're probably all too familiar with the ""fear of the fear"". You know how anxiety is the worst feeling in the world. It's very hard to put into words how helpless it makes you feel whenever you're in the middle of a panic attack, worried it might never end. I suffered from anxiety for more than 2 and a half years myself.

Exactly *because* it feels so fucking horrific, it shouldn't come as a surprise that for nearly all sufferers, *eliminating their anxiety* is their biggest wish. It definitely was for me. It is, however, this fixation on eliminating anxiety, that paradoxically keeps reinforcing your anxiety. It's like a feedback loop from hell.

I'm not a scientist, but I've definitely done my fair share of research. Anxiety is regulated in the amygdala. It's supposed to protect you from enemies, animals, dangerous situations, etc. Your amygdala, however, doesn't really function based on rational or logic. It functions based on actions, reactions and behavioral feedback. If a certain event causes you a great deal of stress or pain, your amygdala ""learns"" that that is a danger. It will then try to prevent you from said danger by sending you signals (feelings of anxiety) whenever your amygdala recognizes a potential trigger.

So how does this correspond to my claim that the recovery of anxiety is a paradox? Well, let me try to explain: Panic attacks and very strong feelings of anxiety can be absolutely debilitating. You reacted to this by fighting these feelings, trying to avoid triggers, etc etc etc. This has TAUGHT your amygdala that the feeling of anxiety in itself is something dangerous that needs to be avoided! This is a terrible thing because it makes us scared of the anxiety itself. It can turn a slight feeling of anxiety into a full-blown panic attack! Your amygdala will recognize a potential trigger, for example, a bodily sensation that you feel during anxiety or panic, and it will send you more signals to try to warn you of the anxiety! (*Oh no, I'm feeling anxious! I can feel my heart beating fast again! I can feel my stomach feeling weird.. Oh no, I'm going to have a panic attack again! I'm back to square one! All my progress has gone down the drain!)*

This can make recovery from anxiety nearly impossible. Fixating on getting rid of the anxiety is a behavior that reinforces the belief of your amygdala that anxiety is bad. It will also keep your amygdala firing signals any time you might feel a little anxious. Recovery from anxiety is **not** possible as long as we are ***anxious*** *of anxiety.*

So, how do we turn this around? Its quite easy actually. Its called doing nothing. Like I said before, the amygdala functions based on actions, reactions and **behavioral feedback.** This works the other way around too. We can literally *unlearn* our brain to respond to specific triggers, and even make it less sensitive in general. We do this by practicing acceptance. Acceptence is, in my opinion, the only true cure to anxiety. What I mean by acceptance is not fighting the anxiety. Not fighting the feelings. Not trying to get rid of whatever you're feeling in the moment, not trying to avoid, not trying to escape, not trying to distract yourself. Instead, accept. Sit with it. Float through it. Not reacting to signals from your amygdala is a beautiful thing. It teaches your brain that there is no danger! We need to teach our brain not to fear the feeling of anxiety, for that is a completely natural feeling! We need anxiety! Okay, you're right, we don't need it as much as you are feeling it right now! But still, the feeling of anxiety is not something we need to fear in itself.

This is not something that will fix you in an hour or a day. But keep practicing it. Keep sitting with the feelings of anxiety, and you will feel them subside. Don't try to convince yourself you will be okay, for that is ALSO a reaction to amygdala, and like I said before, feedback and reactions will only reestablish that it is a genuine danger, and that your brain is right in sending you these signals! Float through the anxiety. Instead of seeing those moments of anxiety and panic as obstacles, start to see them as opportunities to train yourself! Try to place your worst enemy in a positive perspective, and you will see how fast your perception changes. Everytime you get a panic attack, that’s an opportunity to teach your brain to be less anxious! Those moments of pain are the only moments where true change happens. It is definitely one of the hardest things you can do. Sadly, the only way past anxiety is to go right THROUGH it. You need to completely submerge yourself in it, and, the hardest part, not fight it. You need to look for the anxiety, even invite it from time to time. Make it your friend.

The good news is, that going through this will eventually give you a mental toughness that very few people will ever have. You will be so much stronger than anyone else you know. It just takes a lot of courage to start the progress, but I’m sure you can do it .

I hope I explained it properly, but English is not my first language so yea. If you have any questions or if you feel like you want me to expand on something please just ask! :)",19Jun2020,1

Some examples are one of my best friends dad died and I saw him in person at the gym and just avoided him bc I didn’t know what to say to him. In my head I felt bad for him but I just could not communicate it to him in any way so i avoided it.

Another example is my mom deals with really bad depression and sometimes I can tell how bad she is doing and I feel bad for her but I just cannot communicate my feelings to her so I usually just will go upstairs and think about and think how horrible of a person I am. 

My gf says I do this all the time with her as well and says I don’t show her empathy or that I care. Why do I avoid things like this? I just feel like I cannot properly communicate my feelings ever.

224,"If anyone educated in psychological disorders can please help me I'd be so grateful.  


My grandfather (85 as of a month ago, married happily) has been hoarding things for the past twelve years.  
In storage units, their bedroom (It was completely unusable until emptied/cleaned three times), even leaving things at other peoples' places like leafblowers, lawnmowers, gas cans, stereo equipment you name it.  


90% of this stuff is complete junk that doesn't work, can not be fixed or it isn't worth it.   
He's always been sly trying to get things for free without ""actually stealing"".  


But today broke the last straw.   


He came into my work yesterday, took a tag off of something (Stereo cabinet + equipment) and rewrote it as Paid. I realized it today when rearranging things in the pickup room.  


When I confronted him (Politely, I always try to defend him and reason with him to understand if he did in fact do something wrong) he flat out lied, denied it, got angry when caught in several lies during the conversation, and made things up on the spot.  


I have 1000% proof that he did completely steal these items.  
To sum it up; We use a certain method (same color inks, stamps, etc) to determine if something is in fact paid for. He made up the person on that day at the counter, saying it was an old woman. She was in fact a 50 year old blonde with not a gray hair. He said it was 10$ USD. It was 65. My coworker wrote the ticket and set the price just the previous day. He denied writing the ticket but it had no price, was in blue ink (we use red) and the half we give the customers was written 'Paid Off' in the same writing and blue ink, but we only use stamps on that half to prevent theft in situations like this.  


I love my grandpa and he is generally a swell guy, but this is getting absolutely out of control.

226,"Bit of background: I consider myself to definitely have something wrong with my mental health, and have for years. I more specifically would guess I have depression and probably anxiety too (and I mean all/ most of the symptoms for the past four years). I tried to get help when I was 14 (5 years ago) but my parent nor the GP provided much help and sort of pushed me away from attempting to get help any further. Also experienced some disordered eating too etc, point is theres definitely something up.

Anyway, struggled quite severely for a long time, and had a big life change or two late last year which helped quite a lot. However I still struggle with depression and anxiety symptoms but luckily am in a place where I acknowledge that for the sake of myself and those around me I need to try and do something about it. I’m considering getting some free counselling  sessions because I don’t think I’m a severe enough case to warrant a proper mental health intervention (I was in the past but no one noticed enough to intervene and I didn’t want help). 
I don’t entirely understand the benefit of counselling sessions. I have nothing specific to talk about and I know what I’m thinking is irrational and untrue but it still happens and I can’t control it, same with lack of motivation and self-esteem. I feel like a counselling session would be no better than what I do in my head to try and stop it. What is it like? Has it helped you, or should I seek another form of help or none at all?

I’m back home this summer from my jr year at college. This is the first summer I’ve not worked on my campus - everyone had to be sent home. 

I’m becoming really aware of how toxic the relationships is but I feel terrible bc she is my mom

It’s always been this way but it’s getting hard on me 

she’s been very depressed- has been cut off by her family for freaking out and having panic attacks- and her family is full of jerks- she has these when I don’t do things she wants me to do/ or when I was playing soccer on travel teams she would have them after a game where I played bad - when I started to resent soccer - and talked about quitting she said that she would kill her self bc she would no longer have reason to live 

my dad is verbally abusive to me and her (used to be every morning before school) (but now he mainly just rages to her and tells her how worthless she is , he is an alcoholic)

But he can’t do any paperwork for his job - bc he either wasn’t educated or doesn’t try but I guess he can’t read or write well/ my mom does all these things for him - and does all my taxes and school forms and doctors stuff

When I tell her I need to do this- I’m an adult - she gets sad , she does it anyway, I let it happen, she insists on buying all my clothes, and does before I get a chance to 

She is very obese(has been my whole life)- with age she can hardly move now- being at home I have to do, move , get everything for her - and when I get frustrated she’ll use guilt language 

I’ve started exploding like my dad and I hate it 

I’ve had many failed relationships my time in college, and many rumors I’m unstable- I’ve trying to beat my drug addiction problem- which I’m doing better, i got very addicted to acid , weed , adderall 

The rumors were mainly after a bad break up where I found out I was the other woman- and wrote the person poems and letters , partly calling them jerks, but also apologizing - so I got labeled obsessive and angry bc she told her gossipy friends 

I know that’s tangent but - I feel so lonely and I’m still obsessed with that girl and it’s been a year since she ghosted me (after receiving poems) 

But I’m getting very angry at my relationship lessons from my parents- and being removed and coming back - I’m going into rages all the time- my mom knew a bit about my lsd addiction but when I say Im craving a tab she tells me I can do it - and I do

we don’t really have money for rehab 
I keep hoping they will die , so I can take what’s left and move on

236,"Hey guys, 

I've fought serious depression and anxiety issues for most of my life. About 4 years ago, I started a journey taking celexa after a particularly difficult period in my life. Citalopram made me significantly less anxious and depressed, but really made me feel numb. After taking it routinely for nearly a year, I weened myself off of it and went medication free for about 2 years. My symptoms and anxiety and depression slowly began creeping back  (but at least I could feel 'something'). I eventually decided to get back on medication as a of a couple weeks ago. I went and talked to my doctor and relayed my complaints regarding the 'zombie' feeling I would get taking citalopram. He put me on lexapro (escitalopram) instead. .

I cant tell you how much of a significant difference I'm already experiencing. I feel more alive that I have in nearly half a decade. I've had to courage to start going to the gym regularly and life generally feels like its heading in an upward direction.

237,"I'm a university student pursuing a BS in Physics with a minor in Math. I feel really lost because I don't have any ambitions/dreams for my life. For example I have a friend who is also a physics major who wants to go into scientific journaling and/or astrophotography and she is passionate about those things. I think physics is really interesting, and I do decently well in school (3.72 GPA, which is pretty ok for a physics major at my school), but I have no idea what I actually want to do with my life. I feel like I'll never be smart enough or knowledgeable enough to do anything worthwhile when there's already so many people who are much smarter than me.

I often (almost constantly even) imagine scenarios in my head of myself, but a better version of myself, in a different life. Sometimes these scenarios involve physics, but more often they don't. This worries me because maybe I picked the wrong major. But I'm just going into my senior year of college so I feel like it's too late to change and I would have wasted 3+ years of my life on physics if I change majors. And you might try to tell me that if I enjoy imagining these scenarios then I should try to achieve them in real life, but the problem is that most of them are completely impossible to achieve. And I'm not being pessimistic - I mean they are literally physically impossible (like fantasy/sci-fi).

I also feel really lonely. I have close friends but haven't been able to see them because of covid. But since we're at different colleges, we rarely got to see each other in person even before covid. I love seeing my friends in person and feel very touch-starved without them. I also worry that no matter where I go in life, I'll never be able to make such close friends who I feel so comfortable around. I feel like it's hard to develop strong friendships as an adult.

They want me to not be depressed at all anymore. And guys, that’s who I am. I’m scared to lose the only me I know. Who will I be without mental illness? I can vaguely say happy and unburdened, but I don’t know that person.",19Jun2020,1
242,"My dad just doesn't know how to handle it or how to treat me when I'm feeling low or anxious. Like he cares, I can tell that, but he cares in the most unhelpful way. I'm thankful he cares but it's just so irritating and messes with my emotions more.

I'm super thankful for my relationship with my mum because my mum understands depression. She's told me before that she threatened to kill herself a lot when she was a teenager and she didn't get the same enjoyment out of life and I also know that after having me she had postpartum depression. (Oh and she has a degree in psychology). She understands that repeatedly going on at me about applications and things will make me anxious and stress me out. She knows to not push me to do something when I don't want to. My dad doesn't have that. He'll be completely oblivious to the fact he is causing me to start panicking. He will pester me to do something with him until I give in, not because I want to but to get him to shut up.

I know I'm lucky in the first place to have such caring parents and also that my mum has experienced mental illness so she really understands my needs. I just find it so frustrating that my dad does things that fuck with my mood. That's kinda why I'm crying at the minute. It seems silly but for some reason it's triggered some intrusive thoughts.

ALSO I WANT TO KNOW WHERE MY SH TOOL IS! It went missing months ago when my parents tidied my room and it's not like I can just ask hey wheres that sharp object I mysteriously kept hidden in my room?",19Jun2020,1
243,"I am no longer going to constantly research what’s wrong with me—I am perfect the way I am, even if some mental health issues are present. All reading about it does is give me anxiety. I am done. 

I will no longer let sociopathic tendencies take over either—I can recognize them and change them from a place of hate to a place of love. 

Love you all 💜",19Jun2020,1
244,I have no idea if this has to do with depression or anxiety or whatever but recently I have started to get dizzy out of nowhere while I'm sitting on the couch or walking and along with that I'm loosing interest in everything alot more now and just feel like a wet bag of sand. I hate feeling like this. Does anyone get similar feelings?,19Jun2020,0
245,"Throwaway account because reasons.

So, Ive always been a pretty chill dude. I manage stress well and dont really dwell on stuff too much. For context, Im in my late 20s, well employed young STEM professional.

Myself and the wife are expecting, planned, and very happy about it. However, reflecting upon stuff, I guess Im feeling anxious about the whole radical life role change. The whole situation might be augmented by the covid thing, being locked up and concerned for the wellbeing of my loved ones.

Ive noticed in the past few months that Ive been seeking out reasons to party, moreso than usually. Not only that, but I actively seek out parties where recreational drugs like coke are common. And when I do party, I tend to go all out, coming home in the morning, etc.

Ive always enjoyed a good party (though until recently only alcohol), but I feel lately its been getting a bit out of hand, by my own doing. Im not sure why Im doing it. I mean, its fun, I forget about any worries or stress I need to deal with day to day, but I also think it might be due to the whole parent thing. Maybe I feel that these are my last few months, where I can really go all out and party  to my hearts content before I am loaded with responsibilities for a life other than my own.

Something that I consider a bright red flag is that for the past week or so, Im just sitting at home, watching tv after having a few beers prior (=no big party), but decide to go ahead and do a line anyway, alone. Maybe because of the fun times it reminds me of?

246,"Hi guys, I was wondering if anyone has experienced this. 

In a couple hours I’m going on a long road trip (500 mi) from nor cal to so cal, and I am having anxiety about driving. 

I couldn’t sleep last night, I tried to sleep for the past few hours before I left, but my anxiety about it is getting worse. 

I’m currently experiencing almost waves of panic for a couple seconds, paired with a couple minutes of being okay. It’s cyclical, and the intervals between each wave of panic is getting shorter. 

I was wondering if anyone has experience with something like this. This is not the first time I’ve felt this before, last time I remember this happening was after a breakup 6 years ago. 

How do you cope? What can I do to calm down a bit before my trip? Thank you all in advance.",19Jun2020,1
247,"I am so lonely, and I don't know if it is just the time but I do think that I will be lonely forever. There is no indication that the feeling will subside, and even if it does for a moment, it comes back as if it had never left. I don't believe I have ever fully escaped this feeling, this intense fear of other people. Even when I am around others, I feel like I am miles apart. When people talk to me, I duck for cover as if I were on a battlefield. Every question another person asks me is another shot from a battlement. I wish that my interactions with others weren't duels. Intimacy is a fraught business for someone like me, who lives in constant fear of abandonment. If I do find someone who I can be close to, I will be sure to never let them go. That is how valuable love is to me. But for now, I consider suicide every day. And if I had the means and the anonymity, if I didn't spitefully want others to see me live, I probably would. But I don't want to give people the satisfaction of witnessing my death. I hate the world too much to leave it. I know that doesn't make sense, but it works for me. I am done wishing for a better world. I have survived this far, and I will survive another day. Sorry friends, I am not going away any time soon.",19Jun2020,1

250,"hey im f16 diagnosed with mdd and gad

i feel like talking about it/venting so i'll do it here ig:

i went through a really bad breakup 2 years ago that i still think about every day, if i ever see a picture of him or someone mentions his name i will immediately start having a really bad panic attack. i still act out a lot of it pretending like im 14 again and saying the right words to him (this sounds weird as hell but idfk). i feel like i will never stop feeling guilty and horrible about what happened.

this year i was in a relationship with someone really manipulative and got stuck in it for months. it was so emotionally straining i feel like theres no more feeling left in me. i also feel like this has permanently put up a wall and i dont ever want to get close to someone againN

i was also molested by my music teacher 2 years ago and i really hate thinking about it but it always pops up at the most random moments and i can feel his dirty old hands all over me and i just space out for the rest of the time. i really loved learning that instrument too but i never went back because i was so scared he would do it again.

ive been struggling for years with restrictive eating, binging and purging and all that fun stuff. i feel like it isnt even worth talking about cause i still have a normal bmi.

i have such bad concentration its just infuriating

252,"close friend of mine took his own life

over a year ago i got the upsetting news of a really close friend of mine taking his own life. Ever since that day like everyone does I cried alot. 

when he was alive he explained what he was going through and i didnt understand it. i just thought everyone gets sad and that we all go through tough times ( we were in grade 12). 

now its a very long story on how everything went down but to keep it short he ended up getting some upsetting news of his own. With this,his mental snapped in the worst way. He was admitted to the hospital because he was a danger to himself. Later while he was in the hospital i found out he was having delusions about me, thinking i was trying to ""expose"" him and i was putting a virus on his computer. With me being a trigger to his emotions i decided i should stay away because he wanted to ""kill"" me in order to stop me. i put kill in quotes because i knew he was so sick and that the real him would never want to hurt me. When he was in the hospital (for about a month) we started to message eachother. He told me how sorry he was about the threats and what not. 


Ofcourse i told him not to worry and to focus on bettering himself. When the hospital thought he was getting better they let him out, which then another event happened ( i dont know what to call it, an episode?) where he wanted to hurt me when he was home. he ran away from home to get to me and nothing ended up happening, but with this i quickly learned he is still very far from getting better. 

I ended up distancing myself. A few friends and family told me to let the doctors help him and i shouldnt message him to check up on him anymore since he still has these thoughts about me. so thats what i did. i lost a very close friend for like 6 months. i would check on him by asking his brother and get updates that seemed promising. 

Anyway after several months,he was released. it was unclear how he was doing because i knew he was still talking with doctors and taking alot of medicine. So i continued to keep my distance and wondered when it would be okay to finally talk to him. The night he took his life, my older brother was gaming with his older brother and my friend was actually gaming with them. My brother didnt have a mic at the time and the call was on speaker. it was interesting to hear his voice after so long. He seemed okay but clearly he was good at hiding his emotions. the next day i got the news. i always wonder if i wouldve just said something if it couldve changed something. atleast tried to reach out to him. 

a good friend of mine told me to celebrate his life and that he was gone long ago with how sick he was. reminisce the good times. i feel guilt and  it hurts me alot. after all this time i still cry atleast 5 times a week. even if its for 10 mins the feelings come back. 

sorry for the long post, my first close person to pass away. i have not yet gone to therapy. i kept alot out of the full story in respect to him and the family. i tried to put only major things that affected me. thank you for any advice for thise situation.",19Jun2020,1
