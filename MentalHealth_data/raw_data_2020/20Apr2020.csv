This lockdown is having a massive impact on my own and so so so many others mental health. Either beginning to start pressures or  enhancing them.

4,"I am a teen under 18 who has a really complicated relationship with talking about mental health with my parents. 

The situation is so that I am pretty sure from the years of research I've done that I have ADHD, and I do not mean that I googled online ADHD test and got the answers that I do.

 I've been reading on hundreds of forums made by doctors and my differences between me and the rest of my family and friends are basically explained by ADHD, I really think I have it.

How do I tell my parents that I think I have ADHD without making them freak out or get mad at me?

5,"As someone who went through A&amp;D, i know that i don't remember some of my memories during that time. It was rather patchy and hazy. My SO would mention an event and i'd have to scan my brain hard to remember, but there's none. It's not that big of a deal for me because i was mostly in school that time and nothing significant really happened. I was wondering, how is it for other people? Was it the same, or worst?

7,"I am heartbroken.  I feel like I have had to make impossible decisions and am living an impossible existence.  I feel frustrated that we have never really nailed down a diagnosis (unless my wife has hid that from me which is possible), and we have definitely not found a medication regimen that works well.  It is difficult to help manage her mental health because on her best days she is still stubborn, fearful of being committed (to the hospital), outspoken and unfiltered (a bit rude, really), and afraid of being controlled, abused or taken advantage of.

Alcohol is a contributing factor.  She has been sober for many years and just recently started drinking again.  This quickly led to belligerent behavior, then anger, then an intensely violent and hate fueled rage directed at me.  I was able to get the kids out of the house with a relative.  She called the police in a drunken state to report that I had hidden her wine.  I did not report the violence to the police, but I did leave the house on their recommendation.  After the next day, after she was sober, she still considered the incident to be my fault for antagonizing her.  It is absoutely bizarre to me.  I am not violent, I do not yell, I was not drinking, I try to de-escalate.  I believe that she honestly doesn't remember the events, and can't seem to realize how destructive her behavior is.  I got a temporary restraining order from her and it is in effect now.  She is overcome with hatred for me and can't understand why I would be so terrible as to have her removed from the house.

She knows that alcohol is a problem, but slipped up.  I expect her to stay sober for a long time.  But, over the last couple years when she has not been drinking, there has been a slowly growing attitude of hate towards me and others.  She seems almost obsessed with hating certain politicians, co-workers, family members, etc.  She can't watch TV without feeling real hatred towards fictional characters.  She submerges herself in social media and political news as an escape but it fuels her hatred.

Sometimes she seems delusional and paranoid.  She worries about people having information about her and thinks people are spying on her.  Sometimes she seems to think she is a bigger influence on local and even national politics than I think she is.  She left her first husband under dramatic circumstances that unfortunately parallel what I am seeing now.  She alleged serious abuse, rape and, controlling behavior, but now i question her perspective on those things.

I and my child are safe.  I have a network of family support.  I have a therapist.  She has family (mine and hers) that are there to support her, but she finds it difficult or impossible to trust the people who care about her.  She has access to psychiatric help, but is distrustful.  I am not perfect but I am terribly understanding, apologetic, slow to anger, and just not really that bad.

Can anyone recommend places for support?  My family is good, but they don't have experience with this kind of psychosis.  Her family are supportive, but unfortunately are untrusting of psychiatric medicine and think vitamins and diets are the answer.",20Apr2020,1

11,"I (23F) am from the UK. I have been suffering with mental health issues since I was 16. Since then, I have had phases where I have felt OK and phases where I've felt really down and had suicidal thoughts.

I have tried to access counselling through the NHS countless times. The first time I started having counselling through NHS, they gave me the time of an appointment to attend which didn't suit me, but I wasn't given a number to rearrange, so they took me off the list.

The second time I sought help, they put me in for three group sessions instead of 1to1, which I know wouldn't work for me as I struggle enough to open up 1to1, so a group session would be really daunting.

There have also been a few times where I've not been able to answer their initial assessment call due to being in work, so they then cancel the referral.

On top of this, the waiting list is really long, so I just can't see this working for me. I have been really struggling for the past year and it's just getting worse. I'm in an abusive relationship which doesn't help. I just feel alone and I really don't see things getting any better. 

I need good, regular therapy. However, the question is, where do I look to access this? How do I find a therapist? Is there a site for this? Also, are there any good websites for online therapy?

Thank you.",20Apr2020,1
12,"I‚Äôm starting exposure therapy (if you can call it that quite yet) because I was almost attacked by a dog once and I remember each bit of it vividly every day (I was very young too) and as a result am traumatized. For therapy homework I had to do something that brought up some bad memories, basically listen to dog collar/key jingling and try to decrease my fear rating.

I told my therapist concern I had with dealing with the memories and she said to try jingling the keys yourself or have another person do that. I don‚Äôt see how that would help any and wish I would have asked more but I didn‚Äôt. 

How do you deal with the bad memories? Do you try to repress them and stop thinking about them? Or do you let yourself remember then and just let it pass through you?",20Apr2020,1

22,"I got to thinking about something lately. It's been a little over a decade since my life changed drastically, with the passing of my mother on December 17th, 2009. This, in turn started a journey which I wasn't to emerge until recently. I had to watch for the rest of the school year (I was a senior in HS as the time) my dad mourn his wife. I went to college, only to find it wasn't the ""best time of my life"" like it is for many, but actually some of the worst years of my life. My sophomore year, I finally stepped into the psychiatrist office at our school, feeling better stepping out than I had in a long time. I was terrified to be on medication, but knew I needed to take it (Citalopram, for those curious).

I was suicidal at the time, but luckily I didn't give in to the voices or images in my head. In about a year or so, I got great news from my psychiatrist-I could start coming off the medication. Even though I feared a relapse more than anything, I endured. For a time, I was really happy, though still living in fear of relapse. I started a relationship that would fail in 3 months, then decided to just have fun in my remaining time in college (at this point, a term or so). Then, I met a woman who would make me wonder how my life got to where it was. About a year into the relationship, she told me she was pregnant. Ignoring some warning signs, I got excited and prepped for a baby which wasn't to come, including my brother and his wife buying me a pickup (which I still drive today). Then, under sketchy circumstances I didn't recognize until WAY too late, she told me and the family the baby was stillborn. I wouldn't find out until later that my family knew she lied. After we broke up, she then told me the baby was aborted. A few months later, my dad passed away after a long health struggle. 

A few years later, I am living with one of my best friends, who has this dog. I am left with him one weekend, and this dumb little Boston Terrier shows me just how bitter I had become. I realized the joy of loving on something, and having them love me back. I had allowed my recent past to make me bitter and I hated that. I sought to change it. Soon, I realized that I was living in the past. I was listening to the same songs, going back to the old emotions I once felt. I was analyzing and living in a past which had no more to teach me (mostly of the days during my depression).  I finally realized that it was time I moved on for good, believing that God had finally showed me this door when he knew I needed to go through it. It took some time and was quite difficult, but I eventually walked through it.

This all leads me to today. I live in beautiful SW Washington, I am healthy, am very close with my family (especially my brother), have a job I love, a fulfilling hobby in writing, and amazing friends. I'm finally renting a house, after years of living in apartments. I can easily say that I am the happiest I have been in years--perhaps even the happiest I've been in a decade. It wasn't easy, it wasn't always fun and there are times it's hard to look back and remember those things did actually happen to me. But it was all worth it, in a way--I love who I am, even with my faults. I wouldn't change a minute of my past, because it's made me who I am. I'm looking forward to tomorrow, to the next decade and whatever it brings, because I've already been through so much that I know I am prepared for tomorrow. 

So, the question I pose to you folks: What is your milestone today? Is it a week without the voices? A day you can get out of bed? A year off medication, or finding the medication that works? Let's celebrate what we've accomplished, small or large. Did you just get married? Have a kid? Close on a home? Let's hear it!",20Apr2020,1
23,"I'm really stuck. This isn't me just being depressed, but I don't have anyone to talk to. I haven't texted anyone as no one ever texts me, and it's mentally draining having to keep up friendships that are only 90% me and 10% everyone else anyway.

I've always wanted to see if I didn't next anyone and stopped keeping up friendships would anyone check on me or care? Well, I can safely say no. No one would check up on me.

I haven't been texted first once this entire break, I've only texted a few people asking for homework help.

24,"Literally what I said to the person who supposedly was gonna let him know. I doubt she got it to him because the lady really didn‚Äôt sound too confident that she even heard me but whatever. 

I was on Lamactal for a month and a few weeks and the moment they raised me from 50 to 100mgs I got awful stomach cramps, pale diarrhea, nausea, and it felt like I had to consciously tether myself to the present. I was so spacey and it felt awful. Not only that but my mood really hasn‚Äôt changed or gotten better; hell, it only makes depression moments last longer. 

I *tried* telling him that my moods were not changing when he called for this months appointment but he kinda brushed it off and asked if I were developing a rash instead...because I was supposed to be raised to 100mgs that day anyways. Idk that kinda irritated me. I‚Äôm dreading having to explain to him why I‚Äôm not taking the medications anymore and I bet that he‚Äôll say something about my marijuana use (which Jesus H Christ it was the only thing that helped ease the side effects.)

25,"As a bit of background I'm in my teens and my mental health has been declining since the last few years. Part of this I feel comes from my grades, but I've been feeling very hopeless about my future as well.

Growing up I've always expected all As from myself which was not difficult to achieve in elementary school. However my new high school is much more difficult and I feel like I'm not good enough compared to my peers.

It's not really because I don't understand the content being taught, I just have very poor self discipline and study skills, and I constantly procrastinate/make excuses so I can do something else more enjoyable. I'll tell myself that I will learn from my experiences and do better the next semester, but I keep on getting worse grades each time. 

I feel like a huge disappointment to myself and my parents, since they expected kind of high of me. Every time I try to go to them for advice, they don't really understand and all they tell me is to study more and work harder. I don't exactly blame them since their school experience and childhood was a lot different from now, and that's probably all they know.

In addition to all of this, I'm growing more and more worried about my future and finding a job/being able to afford things like food and housing. I still have several years (currently in high school) until I really need to care but current events have been making me very worried about what the world will be like by then.

28,"I have more people I care about than I ever have all thanks to the new job I started around 8 months ago. I was very depressed and had more suicidal thoughts than ever before this job. I‚Äôve had a lot of shitty things happen in my life that would take too long to talk about but the main thing was my mom dying unexpectedly 4 years ago and a job that was terrible. I worked at a spectrum call center for billing for 2 years. I got screamed at 80-100 calls a day. If a customer was upset over something completely out of my control (like pricing or technical issues) I would still get in trouble and a bad rating because I couldn‚Äôt make them happy WHICH WAS NOT POSSIBLE. Around the end of me working there I cried all the time and even thought of hurting myself to get to be able to leave work. It was just horrible. I had no friends I was close too as I don‚Äôt make friends easy. I have a very very dark perverted sense of humor and I‚Äôm a girl so I mainly end up being friends with guys. I‚Äôm very uncomfortable about emotional things like saying I love you and I don‚Äôt like hugs or people touching me. After starting this new job, I have become very good friends with 2 of the guys which ended up letting me become friends with their friends and now I have a group of about 6 guys I‚Äôm super close with now and it feels amazing. Especially one guy. He‚Äôs 50 years old but definitely has the mentality of a 12 year old and we are literally the same. He has even said that we are kindred spirits. I feel comfortable telling him how much I love him and how much he means to me. We joke around constantly and always laugh non stop around each other. He‚Äôs fixed a bunch of things around my house.

29,"Throwaway because I don't want people I know to see how pathetic I am.

I'm F14 so it probably seems like all of this is just bullshit, hell it probably is, but what does it matter, you're all internet strangers anyway.

Edit: This is really just a big depressing story of my life. Its probably really boring.

Okay, when I was 10, I went through a really bad phase. I started an internet page where I did some, well, inappropriate stuff for my age. Not like sexual but like pretending like I was involved with drugs to seem ""cool."" Listening to the kind of music that someone who is ten shouldn't even know about. I was very ""dirty-minded"" around my friends. It was pretty much the typical thing for that age, ""hahaha the yogurt looks like cum lol so funny."" Well, that summer we had my cousin (14M), living with us. He technically wasn't my cousin, he was my mom's boyfriend's nephew. Mom's boyfriend wasn't really the best person, but that doesn't matter atm. Anyway, he was sharing a room with me, and he slept on the bottom bunk on my bed. My mom always saw him as an angel, a super cool person. I was jealous, but I looked up to him too. My mom would always make jokes that I had a crush on him. I didn't, really, I didn't. I don't even know where she got that from its just ugh. I made the same kind of jokes with him that I did with my friends. That was a terrible mistake. He started to return the jokes. Except they weren't quite jokes. I was really uncomfortable, and I started to get filled with regret. One night, he wanted to ""play a game,"" If I lost I would have to suck him off. I really wanted to say no, I swear I did, but I was so fucking stupid and pathetic and scared. I obviously lost...

This continued for weeks. It stopped for a week when he promised me for the second time that this would be the last time. But the day before he would leave my house. The day before I would finally rid myself of him and not have to be afraid anymore. My parents left us home alone. And it happened again. I wanted to say no, but I was too damn scared. This time he didn't just want me to suck it. No, he wanted more. I'm sure you can guess, so I don't see a point in explaining. He left the next day.

I convinced myself that what happened was ok. I brainwashed myself into being happy about what happened, even though I truly wasn't. Two years later, my mom and her boyfriend (who were together for five years) broke up. Now it was never a healthy relationship. Ever since my little sister was born, they were really distant. I had a really bad relationship with both of them, so I would go over to someone else's house to get away. Anyway, now it was just me and my mom living in the house. We didn't get along at all (we still don't) and all we did was argue. We tried getting counseling but it did absolutely nothing. Around this time, I got an account on an online game. (my online account that had the inappropriate stuff was long gone, eg. my mom broke my phone in half.) The people there were really kind. They were my only real friends. As I talked to them, I dropped some of my vulgar traits and started to develop some morals. However, I lied about my age. I mean, It's impossible to be respected on the internet when you're 12, so I said I was 14. I didn't see the harm because I didn't think I was going to become so close to them. Fast forward to January of that year. Someone new joins, let's call him Tony (not his real name). I develop a crush on him, and he obviously does the same. We start talking privately on a different source. And now I have an internet boyfriend. I really enjoyed talking to him, and he changed me a lot, and for the better. My mental health skyrocketed, I've never felt so happy. My parents caught us, and same for him at some point, and for obvious reasons, I was in big trouble. We still continued to talk though.

Fast forward to November of last year. (I'm 13 now but I'm lying and saying that I'm 16.) He can't talk as much anymore because he is really busy. With the temporary high dying off, I start getting really guilty again. I've lied about a lot. I told him about the thing with my cousin (He's the only one I told.) But I changed the story trying to sugarcoat. I felt like absolute shit. I stopped talking to other people in the friend group because I was ""bored of them."" SO THAT MADE ME GUILTY. I literally hate everyone at my school, so I really don't have irl friends. The friends I did had annoyed me more than anything. Now I ghosted my online friends, and I'm too pathetic to try to talk to them again because I'm afraid they'll be mad. Now mid-Febuary of this year hits, and I'm having a mental breakdown. I realized how much of a fucked up piece of shit I am. My boyfriend who is now 17, thinks I'm 16. Things had gotten sexual which I was okay with at first, matter a fact I encouraged it. But now I had regret. I tried to ghost him but failed. But then I finally lost it and cut it. Didn't even say anything. I know that I'm the asshole. And I know that he's definitely hurting. I hate myself for it. The next week, schools close. Yay now I have literally nobody.

This wasn't what this was originally going to be. But what I was trying to throw in there was that I have trouble with my eating and my anger. I've had these issues since the beginning of this wall of text. They're getting worse. I just finished a binge eating episode and I feel so guilty. I don't want to believe I have an eating disorder. I don't want to be the victim. I just wish I could be happy. I'm considering just not eating, that would end the guilt, right? But I know that's bad, and it would just lead to more guilt.  I also find myself lashing out on my little sister. Shes only 5. Why am I doing this? Why am I so fucked up? I want to stop, but I don't know how to. I had one friend left, my cat.

Today was a weird day. Everything was going good, like the other quarantine days, kinda boring, just doing the same things, until I started feeling literally empty. When I say 'literally', **I really mean it**. I just felt like **my chest was empty**. Something was missing. I just wanted to get in my bed and cry. It's hard to explain...

I had already felt this before once, like 9 months ago, but that time was much **worse**. That time I had this feeling for 4 days, approximately. It was something **awful and scary**.

The only thing that i know that that happened both times before i felt this way, is that I couldn't get something. Let me explain this. I think I get this feeling because I want something and I can't get it, specifically a relationship with someone. I see beautiful people that attract me, and I kinda fall in love with them, and I get sad because I will never have something with them.

I hope you can help me, tell me if you felt this way before, or anything you¬¥d like to tell me. Any comment will be helpful because i struggled with these situations by myself, and I need to talk with someone about this.",20Apr2020,1

40,"I don‚Äôt know where else to post this and I‚Äôm still a little bit shaken up so sorry if this is messy.

This evening I was watching a tv show that is usually quite lighthearted, and then suddenly a scene happened that seriously triggered me. I didn‚Äôt realise it at first it took about 10 or so minutes to kick in, and then I just sort of faded out of reality. I couldn‚Äôt focus on the screen I kept looking ‚Äúthrough‚Äù it and I had to go over to the couch to lie down.

I can‚Äôt really explain what happened next, but it felt like I took a load of drugs or something; my thoughts were erratic and non-sensical, I couldn‚Äôt move any part of my body except for my eyes and the lighting and shapes in the room kept morphing and changing. It felt like I couldn‚Äôt feel anything, and even though my hand was rested on my stomach I couldn‚Äôt actually feel it there, nor could I feel my other hand covering my face. 
I thought maybe this had lasted 15 minutes tops, but then I got a snapchat from my brother and my screen lit up on my chest and i could see from the time that I‚Äôd actually been there for over an hour, completely unable to move, speak or form a coherent thought. 

This freaked me out and I somehow mustered the strength to move my fingers to lift my phone, but it fell onto the couch beside me, and by the time I was able to move that hand to grab it another 30 minutes had passed. Luckily my housemate came downstairs and I could communicate with her by typing on my phone, but my right thumb was the only thing I could move and I didn‚Äôt even have the strength to press the home button (Still got the IPhone 6) and I kept ‚Äúslipping‚Äù from reality. My lips were glued shut and it felt like my jaw had been wired closed. Even moving my eyes to look at her was exhausting. 

It took maybe 40 minutes to get me out of this state but I‚Äôm still zoning in and out and I look and feel like I haven‚Äôt slept in a week.

42,"WARNING: self harm mentioned

Some context: I was diagnosed with anxiety (but also displayed symptoms of depression) when I was 15 and never really got any better at dealing with it, but got ""discharged"" (can't think of a better way to put it, but basically my therapist thought I was ready to stop going to therapy and 15 year old me hated confrontation/inconveniencing people so didn't ask to keep going) after going to therapy throughout the summer holidays. Admittedly I was ""better"" but it was mostly because I'd just spent 3 months away from the main source of my anxiety which was school. 

Now I am in my first year of uni and because of a nationwide lockdown all my classes have moved online and students, like me, who lived on campus have had to leave as well. During the lock down my mental health has really deteriorated and I'm struggling to find the motivation to function, I barely eat and I'm pretty sure the only reason I haven't started self harming again is because I've moved back in with my parents and they would notice. I have been trying to think of a way to reach out to my professors about work due over the next two weeks (two 500 word essays, a 1500 word essay and a quiz) for a while now but I have no clue how to start. And to top it off apparently there was an error with my school email, meaning I've missed about a weeks worth of updates (mostly resources we were supposed to read) and the first lecture (classes started online today).

He eventually blocked me after I lashed out for him ignoring what I sent him about a roleplay server for a week or two; Even after apologizing (as he had problems I didn't know about at the time, relating to school). But, a few days ago, he unblocked me and we became ""friends"" again.

That is, until today. I sent him a 'joke' (Which was disgusting and I do NOT know why I shared it with him after one of my partners sent it to me), he said I made him uncomfortable, that he was done, and blocked me in the message directly after the 'joke'.

2. Over the last few years I've felt unfairly treated at work, they think I should just stop focusing on that and move on but I'm not and they don't agree with other things I feel about work. They also don't think I do enough to fix my own problems. 
3. I have a tendency to bury my head in the sand and so things that are stressful or overwhelming I procrastinate like mad, which is now starting to affect my deliverables and how I communicate with the customer, which might affect them later.

Usually under stress but pretty much constant since I‚Äôm constantly stressed;

‚Ä¢ I age regress to ~7 which is right at the age my first traumatic even happened.

‚Ä¢ I get extremely moody. I love everyone and feel talkative, think I look good, feel okay, feel secure in my current relationship, eat healthy, shower, exercise, etc. Within the next hour I could feel the exact opposite. The bad usually lasts longer than the good

‚Ä¢ The world around me seems fake, my reflection feels like a different person, everything feels like I‚Äôm watching a movie or playing a game. No real emotions just empty.

‚Ä¢ I become a ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù person by wearing wigs and doing makeup. I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs a form of escapism which I also play video games, watch anime, anything that takes me out of real life. I get depressed when I have to stop or when I can‚Äôt do those things.

‚Ä¢ I get irrationally upset at the smallest things. Crying, screaming, sitting and staring at a wall for hours. The works.

‚Ä¢ Extreme insecurity, being very clingy and emotional, always asking if my boyfriend loves me still, not believing and thinking he‚Äôs tired of me etc. This is usually followed by feeling like I‚Äôm trapped in the relationship, thinking about other people in a sexual way, feeling bored. Which is then usually followed by extreme guilt and sadness. (I love my boyfriend, I know that and do not act on any of my feelings.)

‚Ä¢ Nightmares. The first sign I‚Äôm reaching my limit is the nightmares come back. These are followed by paranoia and panic attacks. They go away when I start to feel empty and disconnected.

‚Ä¢ I feel like I‚Äôve faked my life, my memories don‚Äôt feel like mine, I feel like I have no real personality, that Im not ‚Äúme‚Äù. My reflection isn‚Äôt ‚Äúme‚Äù.

‚Ä¢ Memory loss. Both short term and long term. I can‚Äôt remember anything really.

‚Ä¢ Existential crisises, dreading being alive

‚Ä¢ Getting extremely agitated, confused and annoyed at loud sounds, bright lights, too much movement etc. makes me really jumpy all the time.

‚Ä¢ I hold myself to an extremely high standard. I‚Äôm an ‚Äúattractive‚Äù person but I am always striving to be perfect in my own head. This has lead to eating disorders, body dismorphia, self hate but also I know I‚Äôm attractive to other people so I think I‚Äôm gorgeous at the same time?

But I believe in many cases, people who use smartphones use them to be LESS lonely. They use them more because they don't talk to as many people in real life as they would online. If that online source of social contact were cut off, they would be much more lonely. Some have social anxiety and find it easier to talk to people online than in real life because it causes much less stress. Surely this is more reason to say that smartphones can really be helpful to mental health? Of course, too much of anything is a bad thing, and if you're using your smartphone instead of caring for physical needs it is a bad thing, but perhaps the reason for choosing your smartphone over yourself is actually something else.",20Apr2020,1
63,"Stopping Klonopin &amp; Starting Xanax

Hi! I‚Äôve been struggling with GAD, MDD, ADHD Combined Type, PPA/PPD, C-PTSD, and PTSD for a while. I‚Äôve been on a whole host of different medications and found out earlier this week that I have Treatment Resistant Depression. 
I‚Äôd been taking Klonopin .5 3x/day since having my son in Nov. of 2018 for Postpartum Anxiety. I‚Äôd tried Klonopin a year before short term and it brought enough relief for me to get comfortable working in my previous job. 
Well, I saw a psychiatrist a few months later and he decided to keep me on the Klonopin because it was helping me so much with functioning. I (a 120 lb woman) was also diagnosed with ADHD and put on 30 mg of Adderall 2x/day (60 mg total starting out, no working my way up). SSRIs had only caused issues in the past so I was put on an SSNRI called Pristiq which I‚Äôve gained a chemical dependency on and which showed no improvement in my depression symptoms. 

Well, my husband deployed and I went to live in a small town with family where I could not find mental health resources near me for the life of me. I was on the same medication for over 10 months.


Fast forward to now...
Moved back to where my previous psychiatrist is (husband returned from deployment) and I had been on the same medications listed above the entire time I was gone. 
I saw my psychiatrist last week for the first time. He took me off of the Adderall because of the extremely difficult side effects I was experiencing (felt high, not afraid of consequences, jittery, anxious all of the time, severe insomnia, reckless behavior, etc.). He kept me on the Klonopin but bumped it down to 2x/day since I had only been taking it as needed (1-2 times a day, rarely the full 3). I was also kept on Pristiq. He prescribed Ambien 10mg for severe insomnia (5mg does nothing for me), and Prozasin for PTSD nightmares. 
That week and a couple of weeks before I had episodes that my therapist has told me are actually considered flashbacks where I‚Äôd go into fight, flight, freeze, or fawn mode. I‚Äôd experience severe panic attacks and dissociation. 
I‚Äôd also been experiencing memory loss, extreme fatigue, feeling ‚Äúout of it‚Äù, feeling numb, etc. and at my most recent appointment with my psychiatrist he told me the Klonopin was the most likely culprit of those symptoms. So he told me to stop taking the Klonopin and he instead prescribed me Xanax 1 mg 3x/day scheduled. 
I‚Äôve done as instructed and searched everywhere for support but can only find detoxing articles and rehab sites about coming off benzodiazepines. I‚Äôm looking for advice on starting Xanax. I‚Äôve been experiencing extreme fatigue, nausea, drowsiness, dizziness, and all over just feel like I‚Äôm a zombie. I‚Äôm wondering if these side effects are normal and if they‚Äôll eventually taper off as I get used to Xanax. I‚Äôve just been struggling to adjust and am not sure why. Whether it‚Äôs an adjustment to the Xanax, coming off Klonopin, stopping taking 60mg of Adderall daily, or if it‚Äôs the Xanax mixing with my other meds (Pristiq, Ambien, Prozasin, as well as Nexplanon and .175 Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism as I have no thyroid). 

Any help or advice would be appreciated!",20Apr2020,1
64,"I have always been called OCD from my mom and just random people about stupid things that I do but I know having my clothes be a certain way isn‚Äôt really what OCD is about. I‚Äôve done some research on the topic because of some thoughts I was having that would not get out of my head that I kept having to check for over and over again looking up things on the internet and killing my brain over. This is kind of the first problem that I‚Äôve had for a while and I just want to know if it‚Äôs normal.

I hate when people self diagnose so it‚Äôs hard for me to tell people about problems that I‚Äôm having because I don‚Äôt want them to feel pity for me or think I‚Äôm trying to make excuses. 

Another thing I‚Äôve realized about myself is that I work so much better when I have some extreme time restriction placed on me. It‚Äôs hard for me to focus or not get upset for example on a painting that I have due for class until it‚Äôs the night before and I stay up all night working on it. This has really effected my school now that I‚Äôm in college and working on complicated art projects that need way more preparation then a binge working session one night. 

I feel like so much is wrong with me and this probably sounds stupid. I feel so thrown off balance by this corona virus thing and I barely can do my work because I‚Äôm so stressed about how much work I have to do. WHAT DO I DO. 

Please let me know if this is just something normal.",20Apr2020,1
65,"i'm 19 and i came home due to the pandemic over a month ago and have been staying with my family. over the past few weeks i have been working through the realization that i was very often emotionally manipulated and gaslighted as i was growing up, and this has obviously led to a lot of difficult feelings as i begin to realize the way that this has irreparably changed me, the way i see myself, and how i interact with others. this is especially difficult to handle as i am currently living with the individual who caused this harm, even though i am an adult now and i am more aware of ways to guard myself from that mental harm. 

i'm seeing a therapist weekly who has been able to help somewhat with processing all of this, along with other traumatic experiences that have been coming to the surface since being back home, but something that has been more troubling is the constant attack of what i can only explain as ""intrusive memories"". many many times throughout the day i will be suddenly hit with a memory that feels incredibly visceral and overwhelming. my body reacts to these and i will feel myself jolt and tense up, and my brain will fill up with thoughts that are loud and fast and uncontrollable. i feel sick to my stomach and i have to close my eyes as tight as i can for 30-60 seconds and focus on my breathing in order to get them to pass. 

i've had intrusive thoughts before, i think everyone has. but these have been debilitating and happening at least 5 times a day, and even after they pass the feelings of mental exhaustion and the exacerbation of the depression i already have continue to stick around. i don't know if this is something that others can even help with, or if i just need to work it out on my own, but if you have any advice or you have experienced anything similar it would really really help. thanks.",20Apr2020,1

70,"The dogs started barking at midnight, so I came downstairs. I saw a person through the window and screamed. Then he rang the doorbell. My parents came downstairs and answered it. It was someone who used to be our neighbor.

Some backstory. My sister and this guy used to be friends when they were little. He had autism spectrum disorder (previously called Aspergers). When my sister was a teenager she diagnosed herself with ASD. One day (when she was an adult) she got fed up with us and decided to move to New York without telling us (this was pretty normal for her). I drove her to the airport and she told me she was going to Iceland (we have family in New York and we were able to confirm that she had contacted them to stay with them).

Earlier in the day we had been going through some old stuff in the basement and found a letter the boy wrote to my sister when they were little kids. It said they should get married when they‚Äôre adults. My mom thought it was cute and sent a picture of it to his mom. I think that‚Äôs what triggered this event.

When my parents answered the door, he told them that my sister was in trouble because she was doing the same thing he did. For a second I was really concerned something had happened to my sister, until I heard more of the conversation. I didn‚Äôt hear all of it, but I heard my dad ask if he had driven here, making me think it was a bit of a drive (I don‚Äôt remember where he lives. For some context, he‚Äôs about 31). He talked about clocks, information entropy, and asked if he could have the love letter back. My dad told him to go home and the guy said he would sleep in his car.

After he left my dad told me he thinks the guy is having a psychotic episode. My mom called his mom and she told us that he was very sick mentally, and that he probably wasn‚Äôt even aware of the pandemic.

So I turned on the house alarm (I think he‚Äôs harmless, but it makes us feel safer), and right now he‚Äôs probably outside our house in his car. Don‚Äôt know what his current living situation is, but I‚Äôm hoping his mom will be able to convince him to seek help.",20Apr2020,1

For some reason, I thought it was the beginning of finding something real. Since then, though, I have just been in one long depressive episode. 

Last July, my best friend resigned from work, and we don't live near each other. So now I have no-one. 

I tried talking to girls for about a month after what happened, but I gave up on that. From my heartbreak, I have just been thrown into the deep end. I have to build a life from scratch.

Why do people think that leaving a toxic relationship is a good thing? 

People say that it's a learning experience. Well this experience has taught me everything I need to know...

I told my therapist and he asked if I think I should get a evaluation in a mental hospital. I‚Äôm honestly too scared to go because I‚Äôve been to 2 before in high school and it just made things worse.

I told my therapist I don‚Äôt want to be evaluated and that I felt safe. I do feel safe I won‚Äôt do anything because of fear of doing so. But lately I‚Äôve been having constant anxiety where I cannot even take deep breaths without my chest hurting or go a day without crying out of no where.

77,"Hi. I made this throwaway account to look for help on an issue thats plaguing my mind. I‚Äôm 17, a dude, and haven‚Äôt been to school in around a month due to the quarantine shutting down schools.

Sometime back in around February, a student got moved from another class into my class with me and all of my friends. He‚Äôs not a bully, but he‚Äôs extremely cocky, and will basically throw anyone under the bus if he can get away free. He doesn‚Äôt do much other than copy and be a nuisance to the people he sits around. He‚Äôs an asshole but he doesn‚Äôt physically hurt anyone or anything like that. 

Recently, I‚Äôve been having this issue thats been killing me and making my everyday life terrible. You know when you play a song, that used to be your ex‚Äôs favorite song? And you can‚Äôt stand to listen to it anymore because it reminds you of your ex? This is much similar to the issue I‚Äôm having now. Whenever I‚Äôm doing something, whether it be watching a show or whatever, If a random thought pops up into my head that reminds me of him, I instantly start hating the show as it consistently reminds me of that asshole. For example, If I‚Äôm listening to music and this random thought just happens to trigger, my mind for some reason instantly wants to turn the song off because now it‚Äôll forever be associated with the thought that I‚Äôm reminded of this dick.

This overthinking is making me literally hate everything and its making it impossible for me to enjoy anything anymore. For some unknown reason, my mind just does this. It instantly connects whatever I‚Äôm doing to me being reminded of this asshole.

Does anyone know how to stop these thoughts? How to stop my brain from doing this unnecessary garbage? Any help would be appreciated. I‚Äôm feeling extremely unmotivated and I feel like I hate everything now. I just cant get this asshole out of my head. 

Any help would be appreciated... I‚Äôm sorry for the long read. Maybe me saying this will actually help me a little bit, I‚Äôm getting it off my chest to someone atleast. Really, any help or support is much appreciated. Schools officially ending soon and maybe the fact that I‚Äôll never see him again will finally stop this torment... but I really, really need some help with those. I feel like a mess. An overthinking mess.",20Apr2020,1
78,"The other day I took a trip to the hospital because I was having BAD  chest pains and concerning symptoms such as: shallow breathing, and intense buzzing and tingling throughout my entire body, and very bad dizziness. I could barely speak or walk when it was at its worst. That whole week I had COVID like symptoms (fever, sore throat, dry cough,  extreme tiredness), but when it reached its peak I had to go the ER.  They asked me originally if I took any medication - so I told them I  took a low dose of an antidepressant for my general anxiety disorder. As soon as I told the nurse this, she left me alone in the room (barely checking on me) when I felt like I was going to collapse. When she came in, I pointed to my vitals with concern - she scoffed and said ""yeah, of  course,  your oxygen is low and your heart rate is 125 bpm. you are  working yourself into a fit!"" I wasn't hyperventilating, I was just  breathing more quickly because every breath I took was shallow. I tried to tell her I was nervous about the buzzing, the buzzing didn't happen after me being nervous. Then the doctor came in and just said: ""you just  had a panic attack you are fine, Do you need us to hook you up with a  therapist?"" I tried to explain to him I never had this bad of chest pain and uncontrollable shaking/tingling in my entire body and my vision blacking out from it. He just smiled and said ""yeah you might have  COVID, stay home, get plenty of rest and remember to try your best not to panic!"" the thing is...I knew chest pain was a serious symptom of COVID,  and I get panic attacks from time to time but never experience burning/stabbing chest pain like that and that WEIRD BODILY SENSATION. I  begged the doctor to not discharge me and stay to look at my vitals.  Because when the nurse left me alone my oxygen saturation got to 76 -  and it supposed to be 92 or higher! I wanted to show him how it fluctuated, but since the last reading said 92 ""I was fine"" I went home and the next day the burning got SO SO bad in my lungs. Every time I  would inhale even lightly I had SHARP, STABBING PAIN, the dizziness got  way worse I couldn't walk, I had a HIGH fever, and genuinely felt like I  was on my death bed. Every time I exhaled there would be a noticeably  loud crackling sound my boyfriend could even hear. I also started to cough up blood. I went to another ER, and I chose to not mention my anxiety diagnosis and they took me SO much more seriously. They decided to actually do detailed testing on me (blood tests, CT scan, urine  tests) not just the old fashioned x-ray and stethoscope. They found an  abnormality in my blood from BACTERIA in my bloodstream. They found my lungs were dangerously very filled with phlegm and fluid in the CT Scan.  They showed me the picture and said it is very clear it is a bad  ""COVID-19 Bacteria Induced Pneumonia Case"" just by seeing how blocked my lungs were I was so terrified. Luckily, immediately after they  instantly put me on VERY STRONG ANTIBIOTICS through an IV to try to help  me as soon as possible. They told me when that tingling happened, my body was reacting to the lack of oxygen from all the gunk in my lungs.  They said it was pretty severe for my age, but they were going to do  what they could to help me. Even now that I am on an inhaler and strong  antibiotics I still have difficulty breathing (but I know that if I  never went back to the hospital and listened to the other ER that said I  was just panicking, it could have been much worse - I could have died)  It makes me so sad how biased those doctors were towards my mental illness. But I just want to say to anyone with scary medical symptoms  (who is not getting taken seriously by doctors due to your anxiety diagnosis) PLEASE keep trying to get help. Not all doctors will dismiss you. If you feel there is something genuinely wrong, don't stop looking for treatment until you get the help you need!!",20Apr2020,1

80,"As some of you know this is the time that people are being accepted into uni. I'm not one of those people, all five of my offers have turned me down, not because my personal statement was bad or my grades weren't good enough but because courses were full and one uni just didn't want me. Ontop of that there's this whole quarantine, and because of it combine with the stress of being turned down for all my options I missed the deadline for some coursework that was really important. When all of this happened at once I ended up breaking down and going slightly mental to my girlfriend over text (Not mental as in angry but mental as in everything I said didn't make sense) and i havent heard back from her in two days. I don't know what to do, I don't know how to tell my mum because I'm scared she'll  get angry or disappointed in me. I can't explain what's happened to my teachers because they'll just dismiss it as an excuse and won't listen.

81,"So I‚Äôm not sure how to even explain this but I have a bad habit of using outer shielding behaviors in comparison to my nature.

Deep down I am really sensitive, anxious, timid, and someone who wants to be vulnerable and open. But at some point in my childhood in changed.

I began to become very accusatory, insecure, and generally using toxic behaviors cover up all this vulnerability. 

As a child I use to cry a lot, think a lot, and act very shy. I was just a more quiet and and scared person but I also had this confidence and positivity underneath when I felt safe.

So the bottom line is, I don‚Äôt understand why I still continue to be negative, and harsh all in an effort to hide how o really feel. I had a hard dad and most of my family bicker a lot and on top of that I had a lot of people push me as an outcast when I was young.

My guess right now is I‚Äôve just been kinda beat down when I was young so I use this as a unhealthy defense mechanism because every time I was vulnerable people shamed me for it because I am suppose to be a manly dude. I am 18 year old semi bulky guy so I think a lot of people were caught off guard with me being so soft ina accordance to my appearance.

But I dont know, it‚Äôs really ruins my state of mind and if anyone has any input I would greatly appreciate it.

I do eat but it‚Äôs very disordered or unorganized. I will admit that. 

However, it is very much extremely disordered at this time..and it‚Äôs starting to bother me. I thought I could maybe muster through it but it‚Äôs been quite awhile and just doesn‚Äôt go away.  

There‚Äôs a noticeable problem though, where if I cook..usually large family entr√©es or testing out recipes (teaching myself how to cook basically and exposing my family to new things at home but it is  some what a stress relief and small passion of mine from my childhood) but I never eat more than maybe a few bites myself because deep down..I‚Äôm just not truly hungry and often upset or feel guilty about eating my own food or food in general.

I know that the idea and taste of food sounds good but somehow I mentally talk myself out of eating by considering too many options and not knowing or just convincing myself that maybe I just don‚Äôt need to eat and it might be better for me not to.

People who attended mental hospitals even only for a few days or a long time what was it like?

Would you recommend going?

Should I only go if it‚Äôs my absolute last resort?

Could I keep my phone? what was I allowed to keep? Would any electronics be ok?

Could I bring a sketch book and pencils?

Am I allowed to see friends or will I be isolated and alone?

If my insurance won‚Äôt cover it will I be denied care and what did your stay do to your credit?

How much did it cost and was it worth it? did it help you and are you better?

How does getting discharged work? Will I be allowed to leave?¬†

87,"So, I've been struggling for god knows how many years with my mental health, I've gotten into a really bad state before and I keep getting closer and closer to going back there.
I'm actually at work at the moment, about to start, and I can't stop shaking. The anxiety is making me feel nauseous to the point where I feel like I might pass out. I slept horribly and I was plagued with nightmares all night, just like I have been since about a week before the UK went into lockdown.
At the moment, I've never felt so alone. I truly have no one. Back in September one of my friends randomly cut me off because I was ""mean"" to her, and blocked me on everything without a word. I admit, I was mean, but she didn't give me the chance to redeem myself. Let's call her friend A... Back in highschool and until September, me, friend A and friend B were best friends. We were a trio that people knew, and even stuck together within our larger friend groups. I was part of a friendship group of about 9 people and we all did cosplay and hung out together. One of the girls, lets call her C, got on really well with me, but suddenly she started inviting friends A and B places and not inviting me. Then, before I knew it, they had a group chat together, without me, and friends A and B abandoned the group chat that had me in it. I felt so hurt, they didn't even try to hide it. And I could feel myself being replaced again. 
So of course, when September rolled around and I was with A B and C (they all knew how hurt I was by the way) for the weekend, of course I was tense. So maybe I snapped, maybe I was a bit nippy, but I didn't get the chance to apologise. It's like they saw me at a weak point and decided ""Oh, this is an excuse to get rid of her for good!"". I should also mention that friends A and B were always ""jokingly"" mean to me in the past, especially in high school, and it's something we've argued over before, so I think to cut me off like that was pretty hypocritical.
Since then, it's been tense. That's 7 months now! I'm still ""friends"" with friend B, but she hides that fact, never posting about me or talking to me publicly (twitter, discord etc.). Even on my birthday night she never posted any pictures, she pretended it didn't happen, and in the past couple of weeks she's been flat out ignoring me. This is gonna sound dumb but she hurt me the other day by ignoring my request to ""virtually"" hang out on Animal Crossing and 20 minutes later she was playing AC with friend A and C.
It's been a stressful 7 months, avoiding everyone because I KNOW I'm the black sheep of the group, going to parties yet feeling totally isolated. I even saw friend A at a work night out, she asked me if I was okay because she knows I get anxious in those situations and she said she didn't want to stop being friends with me. She told me to go to friend B's party in December and we could talk then, however when I went she ignored me and friend C followed her around all night glaring at me. It was so upsetting, getting my hopes up for her to hurt me like that. But she acts like what I did was despicable, the worst thing in the world, but she flat out lied to me! I felt sick that night and drank straight vodka for the first time ever. It wasn't pretty.
Now, back to present day, yesterday. Two girls who I thought were still my friends from that big group (and honestly? They talked to me often, commented on my posts, this is all so sudden?) Cut me off and blocked me out of no where. I can't escape this, as soon as I felt better about the whole situation this happened. I noticed at 1am last night because I was struggling to sleep, and this kept me awake until 3am. I left our discord and blocked them back, but I feel sick to my stomach. It's like they waited until I was happy again and tore me right down. All I can think of is them all talking in their group chat and laughing at me,having fun, being friends, hating me, and I can't take it anymore. I'm 21, they're all 19/20, but this feels like high school drama, and I CAN'T TAKE IT. I don't know how to stop feeling anxious about this whole situation, but 3 weeks ago I lost an old friend to suicide, and I've started having darker thoughts again and my mental health is crumbling. There's 3 girls left in that group that are still nice to me, and I am so so thankful for them. 2 of which don't even talk to that group anymore either, they agree that they're petty and hurtful, but they're not my close friends, they've already known each other forever. I don't have any close friends, and I feel so alone.
I have work friends, but none of them know the real me. The depressed, anxious, lowkey bit of a loser me. They don't even know that I'm a lesbian because I'm scared of their reactions. Don't get me wrong, they're all lovely and I'm happy I'm friends with them, but when I am with them I feel like a lost puppy just following them around. 

I can't even talk to my family. I've heard my parents calling me fat and lazy, they've said to my face that I'm disgusting (and it's true, one of my depression habits is a lack of hygiene and I hate it) and they constantly say ""No wonder all your friends left you."" I think my Dad gave me anger issues, so I constantly argue with them, but I'm the devil when I act like that, but my 51 year old Dad can throw tantrums like a child all he likes. I'm sick of it. They're supportive one minute ""You can always talk to us! We struggle with depression too"" but the next its ""Get over yourself, you're supposed to be a lady, you're pathetic."" and I never know what one it's going to be.
We don't talk to the rest of my family, so I can't even vent to an aunt or uncle. I feel so alone. I look forward to my days off work then spend them drowning in anxiety, surrounded by my dark thoughts. I can't take this anymore. It's been 7 months of hell. My antidepressants aren't enough for this but I'm too anxious to go to the doctor as it was a struggle enough getting them to prescribe me them in the first place. I have no one, and I can't even make new friends because of my anxiety. I'm 21 and I don't have any close friends, I've never been kissed, I've never dated, I've never felt truly happy and it's all because of this dumb anxiety and depression. I just can't do this, it's all too much and I feel so so so alone.",20Apr2020,1
88,"Throwaway account just because...
I need advice because eventually I have to discuss this with my behavioral therapist. 

This might sound crazy, but sometimes I run around my house in a repetitional pattern. Through the hallway and around the kitchen table. I only run this way, I strictly run with music. 

Whenever I run, I get very imaginative. Almost like hallucinating. I think of surreal things that correspond with the song I‚Äôm listening too. 
My awareness with the ‚Äúoutside world‚Äù is 50/50. I‚Äôm often aloof though, which resulted in small injuries. 


Running makes me happy. I don‚Äôt feel a fight or flight symptoms. Though it‚Äôs a very embarrassing habit. I‚Äôm very dependent on it, and sometimes it‚Äôs a urge. 
I run 2-4 times a day ranging from 5 to 15 minutes. 

Is this link to a behavioral disorder? I‚Äôve been doing this since I was 8 years old ten years ago. 
I tried mentioning this to a previous therapist but he didn‚Äôt believe me.

92,"Hey all, I hope you and your loved ones are staying safe amid the current crisis. During this extra time I have been given I‚Äôm really hoping to iron out the things that are holding me back in life. I have been diagnosed with mixed anxiety/depression and PTSD. I undergo psychology sessions once a fortnight, take my meds regularly, exercise, I limit or completely stop my alcohol intake, do art therapy with my boyfriend, I‚Äôm learning to play guitar and the drums with the help of my boyfriend and his band. Overall these factors have helped improve my mood. I have zero self-harm, suicidal thoughts or tendencies now. But I still struggle immensely with anger outbursts, temper tantrums and sensory overload. I still find I am quite irritable and sometimes hard to be around. Which is hard for my family when we‚Äôre locked up the in house. 
So in order to try and combat the anger in extra ways I am going to implement meditation, mindfulness and gratitude into my morning routine in order to calm myself right at the beginning of the day and hopefully carry that energy throughout the rest of the day. Does anyone have any other useful helpful suggests that could help alleviate excess anger and irritability. There isn‚Äôt much I can do about my sensory overload though, but if you have any tips for that too, please let me know!!

Nearly every day i'll feel absolutely hopeless, suicidal, worthless, and self-loathing. Yet.. a few random days i'll get hit with a fat brick of realization over how overdramatic i'm being. I'll feel genuinely hopeful, and think having a good future could be possible during these rare moments. Then the next day I feel like I should die again. Is this a symptom of something?

98,"‚ÄòSmall‚Äò backstory: I‚Äôm 17 and last November I got a really late diagnosis of ADD. I also have anxiety that comes into play in this. So two big things happened at the doctors that are a major issue for me

1. The doctor said to me that I have ADD but that i seem to be coping well enough and that they could give me meds but didn‚Äôt think I needed them. They asked us (my mum was with me)  what we were thinking and my mum chimes in that she agreed with the doctor. This is where my anxiety came in and was like you can‚Äôt disagree with them kinda thing. 

So I have absolutely no support in terms of coping

2. Small little thing that I found highly annoying and confusing I don‚Äôt entirely understand how my ADD works and I thought that they‚Äôd give me a booklet or something to help me understand or that had links to stuff those kinda things. Well they did but they gave me the ADHD one and so I can‚Äôt tell what applies to me and what doesn‚Äôt and all that stuff


And now I‚Äôm the current situation my brain has just gone into panic mode because I can‚Äôt focus on any of my school work. I don‚Äôt feel safe telling the person from school who handles all the kids with disabilities about all this because I feel like it‚Äôs all going to be on me, my mum has often said to me that I‚Äôve just got to make myself focus and now I probably think that everyone‚Äôs gonna act that way to me even though logically I know they‚Äôre trying to help me. 

I really don‚Äôt have any support, I used to go to a psychiatrist but even if the situation wasn‚Äôt the current one my parents stopped taking me a while ago. I don‚Äôt know how to go about getting it and I‚Äôm kinda just freaking out. 

Any advice would be great ^~^",20Apr2020,1

103,"Hi reddit, I‚Äôm currently recovering from a years-long bout of clinical depression; over the last few years I completely withdrew from all of my hobbies and interests, and as a result my capacity to focus on them diminished. 

My therapist explained that if you spend enough time essentially doing nothing (which is what depression has involved for me), the pathways in your brain that pertain to your interests - e.g gaming - can literally diminish, meaning you have to rebuild them by practicing doing those things again. In other words, you literally have to teach yourself how to enjoy things again.

Currently I‚Äôm undertaking this process by playing an hour or two of PS4 a day, as well as watching an episode of an anime and reading a single issue of a comic book daily. My therapist says that because of neuroplasticity, the more I engage in this practice the greater my capacity will become (I can‚Äôt get through a novel right now for example, but I‚Äôm getting there). My question is: how many different media is it ‚Äònormal‚Äô to consume on a regular basis? 

For example, Are there people who play three different video games at once and somehow follow the story, while also reading a novel and watching a tv series or two at the same time? How many different media properties are you able to enjoy simultaneously?

105," I thought some counselling would be beneficial for some personal problems. I‚Äôm an emotional person. I find myself crying easily and often. I don‚Äôt think I need a psychologist so I subscribed to Better Help. Wasn‚Äôt sure how I‚Äôd go finding a face to face counsellor with this social isolation anyway.

As many may know, with Better Help you pay by the week but you have to pay for a month in advance.

My first session went well. My second session went well even if what we spoke about was not completely related to the original thing I wanted to speak about. But hey, it all forms part of a bigger picture, right? 

My third session again was off topic. I had a rough week being unsuccessful in a job I really wanted and wanted to talk through that. I got a lot of one word answers and cliche responses. Perhaps I‚Äôm being too harsh as cliches and one word answers aren‚Äôt necessarily untruthful. And I can be shy. But perhaps my counsellor is bored because what I wanted to talk about doesn‚Äôt necessarily fall under her speciality?

Each session is supposed to go for an hour. But I don‚Äôt know if it was me struggling to form words or my counsellor but it just felt like maybe she was distracted.

There was about 10 minutes left of our session and she said, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs all we have time for today - is there anything you want to add?‚Äô There was more I wanted to say but I just said nope. I feel uncomfortable putting people out when they don‚Äôt want to help.

My fourth session is booked for this weekend but instead of an hour its only half an hour. Why so short? Perhaps my counsellor believes our therapeutic relationship should come to an end and this will be our wrap-up session. After the session, I guess I do too, now.

Not sure if my expectations are too high, if Better Help isn't suitable for me, or perhaps there's something I'm missing and there's another path I need to follow here.",20Apr2020,1

120,"On the anniversary of Tim's suicide I am feeling a lot.  
I am thinking a lot  
I am hurting  
I am feeling

I think I want to get more public and open about my history with suicide.  
The first time I remember thinking about killing myself was 10th grade.  
I had just been caught cheating on a math test.   
I was always a good student but I was an underachiever. Or I was conditioned to think so. I cared much more about track, having friends and learning than getting good grades.  
My dad would frequently say things like ""you would be so smart if you actually tried"".  
I was advanced but not genius.  
I knew geniuses.   
Kids who had jobs at NASA as high schoolers. Assistant college professors as high schoolers. Kids who had been offered college acceptance as elementary schoolers. National chess champions.  
I was friends with these people, but it was painful to know I was not like them.  
Anyways, I got good grades but never great.  
I thought I was a good, nice person but I knew I had flaws.  
I think the pressure to perform led me to cheat but even that was hardly uncommon.   
Most everyone I knew cheated.  
Regardless, when I got caught cheating, I thought my life was going to end.  
I had never been in real trouble before.  
I was an eagle scout (the youngest on my troops history).  
I was going to rejected from my family.  
The pain was unbearable.  
I thought about taking the bright blue handled pair of scissors and slicing my wrist open.  
Down the street, not across.  
I saw the bright red blood spurting.  
I saw my funeral.  
I saw my parents crying.  
I saw my classmates crying.  
It was calming.  
I think a lot of this came from feeling in control of my emotions.  
I get to decide when this ends.  
I think some of it came from wanting attention.  
To be noticed and validated.

Needless to say my life didn't end that day. My family didn't disown me.  
They were shocked but generally as supportive as they could be considering how much they believed in me.  
Needless to say my dance with suicide also didn't end that day.

That was only the beginning.

The next time I vividly remember thinking about committing suicide was the first time I got dumped.  
I was in the 11th grade.  
A little over a year later.  
It wasn't a real relationship.  
Typical high school relationship.  
Good friends turned awkward. Jealous. Unsure.  
I remember that same image.  
The plastic blue handle of the scissors. The blood. The tears.  
I remember the pain.  
Rejection.  
I remember the cold, dark comfort.  
Control.

After that suicide became more of a regular thought. 

The next specific landmark I remember was an nihilistic crisis during 12th grade.  
Reading Hamlet.  
Deep I know.  
If life had no meaning, there was no reason to suffer. If it got too bad I would just end it. On my terms.   
I was in control.

The timeline gets muddy at this point.

I started drinking.  
I was drinking hard.  
I was a little peacock showing how crazy, fun I could be.   
I gave so little of a shit, I would do anything.  
I got attention and respect.  
I liked that.  
I had an amazing time, I loved it.

But there were the moments where my suicide control mechanism would creep in uninvited.  
I don't have a full psychoanalysis of this time or memory but I was frequently violent.  
I remember the image of laying in the bath tub. Slitting my femoral artery.  
Laying in a pool of blood.  
In control.

I remember the bridge by my house.  
Overlooking the highway.  
I would go there late at night.  
Lay on the sidewalk.  
Listen to the cars flying by underneath.  
Imagine myself diving head first.  
Smashing my head on the ground, then being run over at 70+ mph immediately afterwards.  
In control.

At some point amidst all this I developed an absurd/existential approach to life.  
It seemed like other people enjoyed +/ found meaning in life,  
So I would help others realize their meaning.  
I decided I would be a nurse.  
I found no hypocrisy in wanting to learn a health profession but completely ignore the fact I was sick.

In spite of all this my life was going pretty well.  
I had an amazing, loving, smart, talented girlfriend.  
I got accepted to an Ivy League school.  
We would go together.  
We never said it but we had both decided we were going to be partners for life.  
I might have had a different conception of what that meant than she did.

The next clear image of suicide was freshman year.  
The love of my life joined a sorority.  
I was vehemently against Greek life on principle.  
I knew I would have loved to be a part of it.  
I knew joining would take up a lot of my time.  
Time that would keep us apart.  
It would be betrayal.  
The pain of feeling betrayed, was unbearable but I couldn't talk about it.  
I couldn't see the feelings as thoughts.  
I couldn't find the words to express myself.  
I had this horrible pain.  
And I controlled it the best way I knew how.

I walked miles into the inner city in the middle of the night.  
I laid on the ground.  
I don't have a specific memory of how I wanted to die.  
But I know I was thinking about suicide.

All during college, suicide started to come out when I was drunk.  
I was more forward, violent and virulent.  
I was usually so drunk I would only have pieces of memories.  
I think I used suicide as a way to hurt others.  
To exert power.  
To cope with my feelings that I didn't know how to share.  
To control the thoughts I didn't allow myself to share with the world or allow myself to feel.  
The conversations that did happen in the morning were brushed off.  
""You know how drunk I was. Yes I know it was unacceptable. I won't get that drunk again""  
I did get that drunk again.

I continued to use suicide as my escape.   
My coping method.  
My control.

I didn't think I could look for help.  
Maybe I didn't want to.  
I didn't think I could talk about it.  
I definitely didn't want to.

It wasn't until Tim's death that I got a good look at suicide.  
A clear look into that icy cold abyss.

I always thought suicide was my form of control.  
If I decided I wanted to kill myself I would.  
But I would be sure.  
I wasn't actually sure I wanted to kill myself.  
And that's the only reason I never did.

Tim was the spark that illuminated the disgusting truth.  
Research led me to https://lostallhope.com  
You didn't necessarily have to be sure you wanted to die to kill yourself.  
It could happen when least expected.  
I was playing with fire.  
I had no idea how close I was to getting burned until I saw someone go up in flames.

It was a really hard road.  
I was terrified.  
I was alone.  
It made me want to die even more in some moments because I knew I had to face everything I was avoiding.

It took the fear of dying when I didn't really want to coupled with the vivid image of my wife finding my hanged body, sitting against a door to finally get honest.  
Honest with myself.  
Honest with her.  
Go get help.

I was terrified.  
""What if they lock me up? What if this makes it worse? What can a stranger say to me anyways?""  
Somehow I found the courage.  
I found the thoughts that hid in plain sight.  
I found the words I didn't let myself speak.  
It hurts terribly.  
But I am true  
I am light.

On the anniversary of Tim's death I want to thank him.  
For the beautiful music  
For the inspiring refrains  
For saving my life  
Thank you Tim  
I love you

Thank you Klas and Anki for speaking up in time of tragedy 

I want to open myself up to anyone who wants to talk about suicide.  
Open myself up to anyone who doesn't want to talk but wants company  
Anyone who wants a brother to take on this journey  
I am here for you  
I love you",20Apr2020,1
121,"I've been battling with depression for many years and the main reason for me suffering this was the horrible feeling of being stuck, especially because I live in Palestine under many different obstacles and challenges and Walls!

But in the last year - year and a half, I decided to take a path of courage and face my demons. Though I am still fighting, I started to feel more empowered and that I have more energy for compassion. The feeling of being locked and helpless is vanishing everyday.

I made a video to share my thoughts and my experience with this issue especially that now lots of people are forced to stay home during the Coronavirus quarantine.

I hope that this can be helpful to anyone having the same feelings and needing some encouraging thoughts.

I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right place to turn to. Back in August 2019 my boyfriend (27M)and I (25F) went for a bike ride. We were riding out bikes on a narrow road when I heard a car behind me trying to overtake me. Instinctivelly, I moved closer to the side of the road but then my back wheel slid down the asphalt and I fell off my bicycle. My face landed on the egde of the road and as I was falling I must have hit my abdomen with the handlebars. I knocked out 4 of my front teeth completely even with the bone, broke both sides of my jaw and my chin, I sliced my upper lip and chin wide open, and ruptured my eardrum. But the worst thing was that my liver ruptured and started massively bleeding into my stomach. I was taken to a hospital for a quick emergency surgery and spent a few days in the ICU, then had to have another surgery to repair my jaw, and several smaller surgeries to repair my missing bone and teeth. My body can heal quite fast and they sent me home after 8 days (huge infections in the hospital so they decided to let me go home) but I was up and walking 3 days after surgery. 2 weeks after surgery I went for a walk. It‚Äôs been 8 months and my liver is okay, jaw is healed but I‚Äôm still in the long process of having my teeth done. 

My parents have taken great care of me. My mom helped me with everything I needed and was there for me. My boyfriend was there when it happened and he still has trauma when we mention it sometimes. I always tried to be as positive about everything as possible and never wanted to add to any of their problems by my complaining or not helping out or not doing something with them. I can function as well as I did before and I spent my days cleaning the house, doing some repairs, going for walks with my dogs, cooking, gardening, etc. 

However, my boyfriend has told me multiple times that he feels this accident has f***ed me up and that I am a completely different person since then. It causes huge arguments between us. He is partially right, though. I am much more careful now mainly because I am still in pain most days and it freaks me out a little, but he will suggest things like going ski touring or skiing when it‚Äôs icy and I am not that good of a skier. I feel like it‚Äôs not even been a year since my liver was torn in half and I am afraid of falling again, so I went with him a few times but other times I just didn‚Äôt want to go as the last time we went him and our friends decided to do free skiing in a fresh powder, which is something I have never done and I did not feel confident that I could do. I explained this to him and I told him that I would continue skinning up to the hill and meet them there. He did not understand and told me his friends are going with their girlfriends and why can‚Äôt I be like that and why do I always have to be the one that does something differently than the rest of the group. I felt horrible after that. I know how much he loves skiing and I never told him not to go, but I personally did not feel like going. 

It‚Äôs like this with everything we do. If I don‚Äôt want to go ride his ATV with him, he tells me I was not like that before. If I can‚Äôt eat as much as I did before because I feel sick a lot of the times (I was 119lbs before and now I am 110lbs), he will say he just misses who I was before and that someone should just fix me. This morning we ended up having an argument and he told me I got so boring he does not want to be around me, because all I do is go out with the dogs and lie at home. I do feel so bad for him because I know I am not completely okay. I am scared of doing things. I do not have bad dreams or anything like that but now it makes me feel as if something really happened that changed me into a bad person.

Being constantly told how bad I am and what I am doing wrong has really caused me to feel awful about myself most of the time. I know I no longer laugh as much as I used to and I no longer enjoy things as much as I used to. I don‚Äôt know whether the accident really has something to do with my mood and if so what should I do about it. I just generally feel bad and my boyfriend‚Äôs comments are not helping at all. He told me I was perfect for him before that but now he feels I am not that person anymore. 

TL,DR Got into accident when I was riding my bike, nearly died and spent a few days in the ICU. Boyfriend tells me I have changed since then and that I am boring and he does not want to be around me as much. I feel sad and do not enjoy things as much anymore. Don‚Äôt know if it is because of the accident or because my boyfriend‚Äôs behavior.",20Apr2020,1

126,"*Repost from the other day, need some solid advice
please anyone help im suffering really bad

Hey, I'm going to make this as short and simply as possible.

Beginning early january, I began tapering off seroquel, and then successfully quit 4 weeks later. It has been 2.5 months since dosing, until I get to my second story.

I started running into major problems. Depression, and Anxiety came back so hard that it was unbearable. I wouldn't leave my house, as usually. Fear became real. Fast forward to 8 days ago and I stopped smoking weed because I kept having what I thought to be partial seizures. My chest would lock up, muscles would become even more rigid, and a loud ringing in my ears. It was happening every time, and I need marijuana to sleep. Without it I won't get my 5-6 hours sleep that it allows.

I quit and became a zombie. anywhere from 1-3 hours a night of sleep, having nightmares about trauma, and incredibly broken sleep, always waking up. I am a rare case of insomnia beyond what you have seen before, and yesterday night It brought me to my knees. The mental pain was so bad, the physical lethargy was 11/10 although my mind was clearly awake. This has happened to me almost all of my 20s and the only thing that typically helps is seroquel. It slows me down and relaxes me enough to provide at the most around 7 hours per night.

So I caved last night and took about 20mg of seroquel, and almost immediately after felt better. an hour later I ate a pizza like it was nothing and calmed down. I have a history of PTSD, undiagnosed mood disorder, depression, Panic disorder as well as others I can't explain. The level of pain was too high. It was too real, and I couldn't see myself ever functioning with life like that. My suicidal ideation became too strong, it was constant sadness, constant pain when I don't sleep. My brain won't allow it to heal itself. It seems the more overtired I get the harder it is to sleep, too, so it's a never ending cycle. I had to cave, otherwise I probably would have taken my life by now. It was that unbearable, and all of this time I'm thinking through my trauma and drug abuse that brought me to my knees here. Im 25 but my life has not been easy since about 15, the past 10 years have been similar to a night mare, and now I'm liviing it. I'm actually living the life of someone with brain damage beyond true repair, and I'm inquiring to see about getting a SPECT scan done to give me answers. The drugs I have abused likely caused the sleeping issues, but my CNS was out of whack even at 11, when I started having panic attacks. I'm an extremely rare case, I've been having seizures the last 2 months mostly after I smoke, and I suspect because of THC's affinity for dopamine. When I smoke, the first 15 minutes or so, I get extremely anxious and paranoid, even though I tell myself it's ok, don't freak out, you've gotten through it before. No matter how much I tell myself that, my bodies response can be harsh and sometimes it's not even mental. I just feel an overwhelming sense of FEAR, really bad, and then all of a sudden my chest will lock up and I go into convulsions that last anywhere from 1-20 minutes. I would like to get a brain wave scan too, because I spend my life in fear, stress, anxiety, and constant pain. every single day, no days missed. I assume this is due to an increased level of acetylcholine, as I'm constantly stressed even though there are no factors or environmental stressors. I'm tired of suffering, I'm tired of the mental pain, my mental function is poorer than ever, I can't retain anything in my memory and the emotional disregulation is out of control, my body feels like shit every day, I avoid everything out of fear it seems, and if I do give things a try and fail I am destroyed by the effort it took. Its just not a life worth living sometimes.

So here I am. I gave it a harsh 2.5 months unmedicated, but this really brought me to my knees. I most definitely have a damaged brain, and many disorders to go with it. No doctor Ive had has taken me seriously, even last time i went to get my chest pain taken care of he just ignored the request. By the way, I still have chest pain and shortness of breath quite frequently. There is a history of autoimmune disease all over my Dads side of the family, so I fear neurological decline in some way. I'm not exaggerating the symptoms Ive faced. It was a nightmare, today im feeling better but I could easily go manic, as I overthink and stress about everything while sitting stationary. I plan to exercise again, but I tried everything for sleep. Changing my diet, cardio, did not fix this. It is a neurochemical problem within my brain, that is unable to heal itself fast. How can my brain heal if I can't sleep? Should I force myself to go through seizures and convulsions just to get the MAX amount of 6 hours? I don't know what to do, I feel helpless, and at a loss. I wish I could get a labotomy. I noticed my head feels hot inside often, I often think it is toxicity of excitory chemicals like glutamate in my brain. There is hope in research that I can come to the bottom of this, but I promise every one that I'm a rare case. It's a massive combination of mental disorders that have lead me to believe that I'm actually screwed. The whole 2.5 months I tried to tell myself that I didn't have anything, and that I could do this, but I was wrong. I'm going to need medication in my life to function, and that's a hard pill to grasp.

Sorry if this was too long. I just hope for a happy life again. Seroquel works well for anxiety, but keep in mind I also have had ADHD from a young age. Everything I do is disorganized, I can't focus on anything for too long, and when I try to learn something, it's gone from my memory really quickly. I suspect trauma, anxiety, and drug and alcohol abuse lead me here. I was always a jittery person to begin with so I need to get checked. It's just, doctors here have not cared. I got rid of my previous doc, but I have to wait till July before my first appointment. I'm not sure if I can wait that long..",20Apr2020,1

129,"Hi, I am a 24 year old female who has never been diagnosed with any mental illness. A couple of years back, I was feeling really bad, I stopped going out, the only thing I did was cry and eat, and really couldn't see the point of living. In this case, although I suspect that I had depression, I didn't go to a therapist or doctor of any kind, and eventually going back to classes helped me get better.

Also at the time I used to have these weird obsessions like checking the stoves were off, then the windows, then that all my family members were safe in their beds. Now I only did these a couple of times before going to bed, sometimes only once. But my real obsession was a tendency to go pee like 5 times in two hours. It wasn't even that I needed to go, and many of the times I just sat in the toilet for a few seconds and then went back to bed.

This also went away went I went back to classes and started going out more, and I didn't even notice it. The only weird thing was that after a year or so I started having anxiety, my chest hurt and I felt as if I was a little short of breath. But again, nothing to go to the doctor, in my opinion.

Then this last year I had a couple of anxiety attacks, one of them in which I nearly passed out. This time I did go to the doctor, got some blood work done, she checked that everything was alright with me physically. Then she told me to try to be mindful of what could be the stressor that had caused the attacks in case it happened again and we will go from there. But it didn't.

And now we come to the current lockdown. I have been in my house confined for the past month and a half almost. My family members do all the grocery shopping and they prefer I don't go out since I've had severe bronchitis and bronchial asthma in the past.

And I've started to feel that life is not worth it again. I don't see the point in anything I do, the long run whatever issue I solve now is going to be substituted by another lately. Mind you, I know that this is irrational thinking, yet I can't stop these thoughts from happening now and again. Nothing overbearing but there are days that are bad.

And the obsession with going to the bathroom is back. I feel like I have to go, not because I have to pee, but just to be safe, like, every 15 min. Last night I went three times in ten minutes. I have read symptoms of OCD are similar, but they affect your life to a greater extent so I don't know if it could be it.

Anyway, I know I should be going to the doctor, but right now that is not a possibility I can afford and even if I could, current restrictions wouldn't help. So I just wanted to know what you guys think it could be. Of course, I won't substitute any opinions for a real doctor's advice, but I just want to know your thoughts on it.",20Apr2020,1

I decided to shate with you an issue that has been bothering me for a while. My younger sister (20yo) has been diagnosed lately with a bipolar disorder, she had been through some difficult moments during her childhood and teenage years. But after her diagnosis, she started understanding more what's going on in her mind,and working on some of the issues she had.

When I realized this, I started doing my best to be there for her but at the same time give her her own space, since her mood changes are very frequent and fluctueny through the day.

 However, she's being very very susceptible and moody,she would create problems from the most stupid thing just to have an argument over it. 

I understand that she's not at her best self and on most situations I just let it go, but on other times it gets really difficult as my family and I do have our own issues and sometimes can't just deal with everything she comes up with in the most peaceful way.

I came here today to know if there is anybody who had gone through the same experience with their loved ones,and what can I do to keep my calm and at the same time save my relationship with my sister.

148,"tw: depression, suicide attempt

my (23f) sister (19f) and i both lost our parents 10 years ago, at the time i was almost depressed and really can't remember that time of my life but i think i focused on my grief instead of talking about everything together, she was 8 after all and i was pretty immature too. after they died we moved into our grandmas house and we have been living with her these past 10 years, living with her is not always easy we can argue a lot but overall shes a great grandma but she can be very cold and shes never been the type to comfort us (emotional comfort) so me and my sister formed this really strong bond
shes the person i can count the most in life and i would do anything to see her happy in life but these past years shes been opening up to me about how down shes been feeling, at first we would talk and things would be back to ""normal"", my sister has many friends and she likes to go out a lot so me and my grandma (and anyone really) that would look at her would think that everything seems ok. 
but one day i was in shock when she tried to open her wrists at the bathroom floor i found her and it was the worst scene i ever saw, that day we talked a lot and for a months everything was calm and ~normal until she tried to hurt herself again this past january and i didnt know what to do because she seemed fine, we would talk about everything (i thought) she seemed fine but after this she told me that shes never fine, that her mind doesnt stop, she like to distract herself from her bad thoughts but she was just exausted of feeling like this all the time and my heart broke i hate this more than anything in my life i wish i could trade places with her this is really painful for me to see so i just cant imagine how painful it is to her.
she began therapy this year, has been diagnoses with depression, has been taking meds but we cant go out during this pandemic to get another prescription. two weeks ago she left our room durimg the night and i went after her bc i felt like i should, she was writing something and said that everything was fine so i went to sleep, the next day she had to go to the bank and something told to me i should look at what she wrote, it was a suicide letter, my heart broke i been in contact with her therapist, spend some time talking with my own therapist about but i feel like im so lost, i dont have anyone i can talk to, i tried to talk to my grandma but i feel like shes too old for all this i dont want her to be sad, the quarantine hasnt been easy on anyone, i just need some light, my sister said to me that she dont talk to me about it because she see how this makes me sad but i dont care about how sad hearing about it makes me i just want to help her, i just want to see her happy.

150,"I feel like I‚Äôve lived a life that someone chose for me. Anything I‚Äôve wanted for myself somehow always crumbles apart and I‚Äôm left with remains that I can‚Äôt get myself to put back together. I then go back to routine because it‚Äôs practical. I hate comfortable. 

I gave up a major I wanted to do to work a career that makes me miserable. I‚Äôm going back to school to pursue a higher level of that career, but only to appease my parents because somehow having a Bachelor‚Äôs degree isn‚Äôt enough and I have to do more. They still haven‚Äôt told me that they‚Äôre proud of me and I‚Äôm constantly in a mind battle with them. They haven‚Äôt communicated with me throughout this quarantine because they think I‚Äôm stubborn for leaving so that I can pursue a life without them breathing down my neck all the time. They‚Äôre still there despite that. Here I am continuing to do things for them to make them happy.

I can count with one hand the amount of people who‚Äôve checked up on me since quarantine started...none of which are people I thought I was close to. 

I‚Äôve allowed every man who I‚Äôve loved make me feel like I‚Äôm small. I never fought back and I allowed it to happen. I push any new prospects away because of the thought I‚Äôll probably never be good enough, so there‚Äôs no point in trying. I‚Äôm waiting on someone currently who probably could care less and I‚Äôve checked up on him more than he‚Äôs checked up on me. 

I still meditate, I still work on my hobbies, and I still manage to workout...however this is all to busy myself so that I‚Äôm not stuck in a constant loop of self deprecation. 

I wanted to do another bodybuilding competition because it was the only time in my life that I chose something for myself, but I haven‚Äôt been able to train completely for it because gyms are closed. I‚Äôm doing what I can at home, but it‚Äôs not the same. I still continue to try, though, because I want to feel a little good about myself. 

I stand stoic and pretend like nothing‚Äôs wrong because I fear I‚Äôm bothering people if I open up. Sometimes I end up spilling more than I should, but it‚Äôs only because I‚Äôve bottled every emotion up and I couldn‚Äôt work up the courage to say another ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing well.‚Äù

I never felt as though anything I‚Äôve accomplished has amounted to anything. I ask myself what‚Äôs the point of living almost every day of my life because I‚Äôve lost every reason to be happy.

Then, last night, my next door neighbor taught me how to do it and gave me a deck of cards. She played obsessively as a teenager when she was struggling most with changes, ADHD, and OCD, and I can see why. It takes your entire brain, just about, to play. I have anxiety, social anxiety, depression, PTSD, and CPTSD ‚Äî all of which have been exacerbated by the abrupt changes brought on by COVID-19 changes and the isolation of that situation ‚Äî and especially if you have physical cards, I‚Äôve found it fantastic.

165,"Okay, so I know Reddit isn't exactly a professional medical place where I could get a diagnosis or anything, and that's not what I'm asking for. I'm wondering if anyone has a few ideas on what's wrong with my dad like what kind of illnesses he possibly has, because somehow I feel like it would help.

Some background info first: there's a pretty big age gap between my dad and my mom(25ish years, my dad is 75 but I don't think its because he's becoming senile, he's always been like this according to relatives) long story short he was a pretty manipulative boyfriend and sorta forced my mom into a marriage. My mom is his second wife. He had two kids with his first wife and then cheated on her with another woman, the other woman left her and he married my mom. His two other daughters cut ties with him since they're adults (unlike me) and have not spoken to him in years.

For as long as I can remember, my dad's always been like this. A typical day involves him *randomly* bursting into VIOLENTLY angry tantrums. A lot of times he'll just get angry for no reason, or randomly bring up something that happened a long time ago and get angry as if it just happened. Or me and my mom will be talking about something and he butt in our conversation and will find some way to act as if whatever he is pissed about has anything to do with what we're talking about and take out his anger on us. The other times, he overreacts to everything. He used to be physically abusive but over the years as he got older he has stopped mostly because he himself has back pain and leg pain from getting old. 

He fights every single day with my mom over small things. My mom mostly tries to ignore him so it's mostly a one-sided argument with him just shouting obscenities at my mom. When my mom is not home he takes out his anger on me and verbally abuses me. He often blames me for his fights between him and my mom and used to purposely make me late for school so I would get detention to punish me for ""causing"" the fight even when it was about something that I completely had nothing to do with. Everyday he just tells me that no one loves me, etc...

He doesn't have a job, a college degree or anything and lives off my mom, hasnt worked a single day of his life since they got married. He actually neglected me as a child. He only takes me to school and makes really crappy food for me to eat and that's it. Doesn't really talk to me and isn't interested in my life, he barely knows basic details about me and only talks to me to yell at me. We're like strangers.

He lies a lot too. In public he pretends to be super nice to people and lies about his achievements to make himself look good. He also lies to my mom and will tell her i said bad things about her when I didn't to start drama between me and my mom. 

He also seems to have quite low mental capabilities. I can't think of any  specific examples right now but overall he is a really immature person and is like a child throwing a tantrum when he gets angry. He has extremely poor logical reasoning and lack of common sense. Honestly I don't even know how he has survived this far because he is so gullible. He believes anything on the internet, like fake news. For example he thinks the coronavirus started in the US and was brought to China, and thinks that you can get rid of bacteria on a surface by slapping it with your bare hand( i really dont know how he believes that...?). When people talk to him they often get confused (or scared because my dad blew up at them) because his logical reasoning is all over the place and you can tell he's kind of.. slow when you have a conversation with him.

Somehow he thinks he is the best and the smartest, though. He seems very delusional to me. He has no friends and he blames this on his old friends being jealous of him. He holds grudges against people who allegedly talked shit about him out of jealousy, and these are people who haven't talked to him in decades so they probably have forgotten about him. He really thinks that he's that important I guess. 

**Also he is uncooperative with trying to get tested for mental disorders. He thinks nothing is wrong with himself so thst he doesn't have to (Well then no reason to be afraid of getting tested then, right??? Nope, I guess not. he's still not gonna listen) and probably it will be difficult to get him to therapy since he got mad at my mom for going to therapy once, so if anyone could offer advice for getting help for him that'd be appreciated.**

My mother said that a long time ago he was diagnosed with a thyroid cyst and thinks that's why he's so angry, but I kinda doubt it. I think that's not the reason why he is the way he is. My friend says he might be on the autistic spectrum but idk? 

If anyone has advice that'd be great, it's kinda weird but I'm honestly really curious as to knowing what's my dad's issue. So far it kinda seems like he has narcissistic personality disorder but it doesnt fully explain the anger and low intelligence. If anyone has similar experiences with parents and feels comfortable with sharing feel free to do so. 

\--

Also, I know that people will probably try and tell me to get out of this, but tbh it's gonna be kinda hard. My mom works a demanding day job so she's not home most of the time, and she's already super stressed from her job that trying to get authorities involved and a divorce would be adding more to her stress. My dad doesn't want a divorce which if i recall correctly kinda makes the divorce process harder too. I also don't know how it works but I'm worried that if my parents do get divorced the authorities will deem my mom unfit to take care of me alone or something. Overall I don't want any risk of getting into a foster home or anything so I'll just wait until I'm old enough to move out. I'm kinda used to it anyway and I'm not in any immediate danger, it's just more of an inconvenience that makes me mad at this point.",20Apr2020,1

11:30 am- Activity time: writing, drawing, anything other than being on my phone)

12:30 pm- Exercise: Take the dog for a walk, bike ride around the block, do stretches, or walk on the treadmill

1:00 pm- Lunch: eat a sandwich, fruit + chips (make healthier options) 

1:30 pm- Chores: Take out the trash if needed, empty the dishwasher, wipe off counter or the table

8:00 pm- take meds

10 pm- go to bed, lights out, no video games because i go to sleep too late.

175,"Feel uncomfortable expressing emotion

So, as a child I behaved irrationally. Intense anger, throwing fits and the like. Im almost 18 now and this has turned into being just kind of a blank person. Here‚Äôs what I mean. Around family, I act with no emotion and it feels very uncomfortable to show any. I don‚Äôt enjoy spending time with them for this reason, that and I get a little bored being around them for some reason that I don‚Äôt understand. Secondly, when I‚Äôm around friends I put on kind of an emotional mask. I act happy, although i think I feel slightly more happy around people it‚Äôs not to any great extent. I think I choose to be around people sometimes just for the fear of missing out on teenage memories. I read situations and then decide how to act, it‚Äôs not a very fluid thing. I spent most of my childhood with very little friends. That is until my junior year of high school when I became a social butterfly. It‚Äôs been two years since I‚Äôve began a very active social life and sometimes I just feel that people are a bother, yet at the same time I almost always hang out with people when I get the chance for the fear of missing out on some memory that I know I should enjoy.

When I dont do this I usually turn to self harm just to get the anger out. It's almost like I enjoy being mad. I think it's because I actually can feel something other than extreme anxiety or numbness. When I'm angry I feel powerful, eventhough I know it's a false sense of control.

I'm an 18yo female. Since a child I've always had a very self sufficient mindset. I think I've been some level of depressed for some time now. I live with my family and when I observe my life it is wonderful so I don't want to change things. Part of the problem is that I have nothing I want to change. I've come to realize I am still hanging around planet earth because there are people I care about here. Nothing has appealed to me personally for a long time. I wake up, see the fam is still alive, do the minimum to stay alive, do the minimum it takes to look like I'm a person who wants to be alive, and repeat. I've been thinking about moving out lately, as a way to test and see if there is anything I would care to do if I wasn't around the people I care about so much. Right now that isn't possible.

I imagine my immune system attacking my heart or my cells releasing cytokines which causes the immune system to attack the body and I get this weird feeling like its happening.

Factories aren't the cleanest places, and assembly line work has you working shoulder to shoulder A lot of times.

Anyway, I don't feel like I can seek mental health now, even though I'm in a constant state of feeling on edge.

I'm worried about my physical and mental health not being able to go out and do all the things I love doing. 

April is a hard as f*ck month for my fiance and I, full of loss and heartache. We lost his Mom a year ago yesterday and a close friend of mine two years before that on the same day. 

And now today my fiance got laid off. 

We are going to be fine financially. We can afford our mortgage and bills on my income and the EI he will collect, and I have no concerns about my job stability at the moment. I'm able to work from home full time for the foreseeable future and have no reason to be concerned that might change. 

But I'm worried about the toll this is going to take on his mental health and it is a lot of pressure knowing that we cannot afford for me to lose my job too. 

I'm emotionally exhausted but I feel like I need to just suck it up and be strong because I truly don't have it that bad and the people I normally lean on are in far more difficult and precarious situations than me. 

The worst part about him being laid off today is that all I want is to be able to talk to his Mom but I can't and I'm so tired of all these things that keep happening that I want to talk to her about and the constant reminders that she's just gone and that's that. 

I'm lucky that I have a great family too, but when it comes to stuff relating to my fiance, I don't feel comfortable talking to my family about it the way I used to talk to his Mom about his stuff. It doesn't really feel like it's their business in the same way.

So I‚Äôm 18M and broke up with my first ever girlfriend about 7 months ago after only a month long relationship. I didn‚Äôt take this well at all and went down a whole road of mental health problems, depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety etc, which were likely present anyway, and just triggered by the event.

That‚Äôs just the background. The problem is that I kept looking at her Instagram very regularly ever since,right up until very recently. She went inactive on Instagram for some months after the breakup, and recently became active again maybe a month or two ago. So I started viewing her story obviously as her account was public (we unfollowed each other), and she obviously noticed me because she blocked me. This is where my behaviour gets worrying and embarrassing. I used my secondary account (for a business) to continue viewing her story, and she then blocked that account too, because she obviously figured out that it was me. I then started making throwaway accounts a lot to see if she‚Äôd posted anything and then immediately delete them, filled with shame and self-loathing. I did the same today and noticed that she‚Äôd put her account to private, possibly because she noticed the random accounts viewing her story and guessed that it was me.

Obviously this is embarrassing and unacceptable behaviour and I‚Äôm hoping that you don‚Äôt judge me, which no one ever has in this community. I know it‚Äôs creepy and weird, but I just can‚Äôt move on and I miss her a lot.

I‚Äôm trying to be more sympathetic towards him because he is taking the break up really hard (together for 8 years and have 2 kids) but his actions are very irresponsible and he doesn‚Äôt seem to understand this. He‚Äôs been living with my mum and me since the split. He came home tonight from watching his children whilst their mum (his ex) was at work. His face is really swollen and one eye is closed shut. 

I‚Äôm not sure why this happened tonight exactly but I do know be‚Äôs terrified of the thought of his ex moving on, believes she cheated in the relationship and is very vocal about it, and oscillates day to day from loving her to hating her. He has spoken to several other girls and has slept with someone since, but he loses his mind at the thought of his ex getting into a new relationship. It‚Äôs definitely taking a toll on him and I guess tonight he was alone with his thoughts and it got to him. 

He arrived home and my mum and I both shouted at him when we saw his face and he explained he punched himself repeatedly. We didn‚Äôt really get to the ‚Äúare you okay?‚Äù section, instead we both jumped to saying he‚Äôs stupid, that he could have really hurt himself and then the kids would have been unsupervised should anything happen. He said they were asleep but other than that didn‚Äôt really consider the fact he could have caused serious harm to himself and therefore his kids also. 

I want to know how to approach this further in terms of being more understanding to his mental health as he is self harming whilst trying to not feel like an arsehole when I shout at him for not only being inconsiderate of his own safety but his children‚Äôs too. I‚Äôve always been a little devoid of sympathy but I know he needs a shoulder to lean on right now. However his actions aren‚Äôt okay. The break up was 4 months ago and I feel his acts of aggression to himself will only worsen and I want to be able to talk to him. Any help?

tl;dr my brother beat himself up over an ex when he was alone with his children and I‚Äôm struggling to sympathise

212,"I constantly feel unsafe, it affects me constantly especially when I‚Äôm alone. I am always afraid of everything from the paranormal to people who want to do bad things. I sleep very poorly and take melatonin - circadin sleeping pills which help to some extent but doesn‚Äôt solve the issue. I am always well armed and very careful. Even with alarms, security cameras and motion detectors I still never feel safe, not even in my own home. Is there any way to change this? I struggle everyday because of it. I have looked at online tests (the in depth ones with 50+ questions) and symptoms for Paranoid Schizophrenia but I highly doubt I have it, any advice? Note that in my situation it‚Äôs difficult for me to access a psychiatrist/psychologist. Please help!",20Apr2020,1

I don't know if I have an actual problem, or that I'm too engaged with psychological theories (about traumas and such). 

I suspect I have a problematic relationship with sexuality. I don't know if it's the usual awkwardness most people have, or that I have an actual issue I should deal with.

I have this really vague memory from my childhood. When I was 7 or 8 I was friends with our neighbor, who was 12 at that time. I know (mainly because my family says so) that we used to hang out a lot, but I barely have memories from those times. I barely have memories from my childhood whatsoever, my memory is generally pretty bad - I lose things quickly. Anyway, when I was 15 I was struck with this one memory: I was in this neighbor's room, laying on his bed (clothed) and he was on top of me (clothed as well). I could feel his penis through the cloths, and I remember trying to slightly move him so I wouldn't feel it, but he kept positioning himself back to that uncomfortable position. I vividly remember the physical feeling. That's all I remember. 

Fast forward to this day: I'm 22 and I've barely had any romantic or sexual engagement with men in my life. I tend to ascribe it to my pickiness and my mental difficulties (slight social anxiety, depression).

The main sexual engagement I had so far was with a guy I met in Berlin. We went (with another friend) to a sex club (I didn't really know it was going to be this sexual). The dance floor had giant screens playing porn. People made out everywhere, walked around naked and in the dark areas they were literally fucking. I saw a man fingering a woman (for the first time in my life I was witnessing a sexual act IRL). It made me feel sick and I sat all evening near the entrance, waiting for my friends. 

I remember feeling extremely depressed during the drive back home (I should say that I was already slightly depressed earlier in the evening, before we even got in). I didn't know why, but I felt awful, like I was violated, although nothing happened to me there. I still don't know why I felt that way.

I kind of want to try therapy, but also don't. I don't really believe in ""digging up"" my childhood traumas - I'm really skeptical it can help me heal (from my other problems).

I just don't really know if I have a problem that's related to sexuality or that I'm just depressed because -. Well I don't really know why, sometimes I just feel emotional pain. I usually ascribe it to not being in a relationship, or not having enough friends, or not loving myself. But sometimes I don't understand it, like that pain that came after the sex club.",20Apr2020,1
214,"what is happening

I was an underweight kid for most of my 17 years on earth. A few years ago I weighed 33kg (72 lbs) and then during summer going into 8th grade I gained 5kg (11lbs). After that I gained 11kg (24lbs) over the years. I dont know how tall I was back then but probably 5‚Äô0 or 5‚Äô1 so the 72 lbs wasn‚Äôt that skinny for my height. 
Now I am 5‚Äô2 and I weight 49 kg (108 lbs) so now im somewhat healthy I guess.
I didn‚Äôt intentionally gain weight back then it happened naturally.
But I also wasn‚Äôt skinny intentionally. 
I have fast metabolism, my mom is skinny my grandma is skinny so because of genes and then I also were never a hungry person whatsoever. I didn‚Äôt lost appetite I was never a hungry person in the first place. I just started recently eating 3 meals a day since quarantine to be more specific. Before that I usually ate some snacks in school and then two meals at home. On some days during the week tho I only ate lunch and a pack of junkfood. And sometimes only a pack of junkfood. My issue is I am not fucking hungry I have to force myself to eat most of the days it was worse back then but now it got better. I just don‚Äôt understand the lack of appetite i have I‚Äôm not depressed i don‚Äôt thrive to have some sort of ideal body I never restricted my self to eat I never did a diat 
Idk even know if I had some sort of eating disorder back then cuz yes I was fucking skinny but I only had lack of appetite that was always the case nothing more blthing less",20Apr2020,1
215,"So we have been together for a few years now, moved in together in September, officially on 1 lease since the beginning of the month. A combination of the quarantine and bedroom issues are really stressing and hurting our relationship and mental. In short, we have had less and less sex and she blames me of not being there during it amd I am in my own head everytime trying to be there and not mess it up and its caused things to be really awkward. We have tried talking about it and we seem good but then a few days to by and it starts to get weird again and we cant get out of the cycle. It seems like a physical solution would ease our mental strain but its the mental strain thats causing the physical issue so we are stuck in a loop and its just really getting to be a lot.",20Apr2020,1

I miss my friends so much, they were pretty much the only reason I kept going to school, and now I don‚Äôt have that. This situation is fucked, it‚Äôs every bad thing of going school and every bad part of going to school, without any of the good of either.

I already have this illogical fear that I‚Äôm being watched and my actions are being recorded, but to compound on this now when I listen to podcasts or tv shows comedy even music.

223," I'm a college student and I work at a grocery store and my job makes me absolutely miserable. I have really bad anxiety, especially around people I don't know. My anxiety had been getting a lot better, pretty much non existent, but then I got this job and since then my mental health has pretty much gone down the toilet. They work me ridiculous hours, bosses treat me with zero respect, customers constantly rude to me, ill have multiple panic attacks a day sometimes depending on how busy the store is. This on top of trying to juggle my school work and my home life is just overwhelming to say the least. I don't think I've ever been more unhappy in my life. I decided to post here because I feel like no one really understands me in my life. I try to talk to my parents, but they just tell me to ""suck it up"" and ""thats just the way life is"" but I seriously don't know how much longer I can survive living like this. I am overwhelmingly unhappy in my current circumstances. I can't quit due to the state of the economy right now and the fact that I have bills to pay, plus this is my first job, so I just feel like any other job I would qualify for would suck just as bad. I just feel so trapped and helpless. Its gotten to the point where I've really started letting myself go too. My place is a wreck. I used to love dressing up and now I barely put in an effort.Plus between work and school I have no time to take care of my mental health..
