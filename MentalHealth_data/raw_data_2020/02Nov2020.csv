0,"I occasionally go through periods of depression. I just recently started feeling normal. I usually feel numb, I start having suicidal thoughts, I lose all motivation to do anything. Even though right now I feel ok, I’ll eventually feel down again as I always do. I don’t know if I should seek help or just pretend like those periods never happen.",02Nov2020,1
1,"Obviously when it has a serious impact on the quality of work I eventually get done, that isn’t good... and if it comes in the form of self-destructive things (let’s just drink a pint of whiskey tonight) that DEFINITELY isn’t good but idk... I’ve been feeling so fuckin low and lonely recently and I’ve been really getting into RPAN lately and making friends there and honestly?

2,"So there’s this person who’s a year older than me who goes to my school who I can see isn’t okay. Although, i barely know her and have only had a few meaningless conversations with her. I’m not sure if her friends have been talking to her or anything but I feel like I should talk to her. But I don’t want to be weird and seem like I’m stalking her or anything? I don’t have her number or anything, just her insta and Snapchat. Is talking to her weird considering I don’t know her? Advice please!!",02Nov2020,1

5,"It hit me like a truck again. The doctor said it’s combined depression and anxiety, but why doesn’t that diagnosis feel right? It doesn’t explain the high or the good times, even if it explains the bad. 

The highs I can manage. I talk a lot. I’m restless and don’t sleep. Sometimes I’m irritable but it always feels justified. I do stupid stuff, I spend money and drink, but I feel good. Optimistic. Happy. Almost an adrenaline junkie. 

The mid feels good too. Weeks of feeling completely normal. Even if I do get mild anxiety symptoms I can deal with it. It feels like nothing’s the matter. 

But the lows. My god. I forgot how bad it felt. I can’t do anything, I feel so anxious and guilty and exhausted all the time. It’s been such a long week. I’m so tired.

The meds he gave me sent my mind out of whack. Cycling up and down so fast. They stopped the meds. Yet the thought I’d just be fine without them. It feels like a kick in the teeth - a reminder as to why I needed the meds in the first place. Why was I hopeful to think I’d be okay without them?  Nothing had changed. 

Two more months of this hell, in a best case scenario. I’m so tired, I’m dragging my feet. I’m not sure I have the energy to keep trying.",02Nov2020,1
6,"Honestly, my current depressive episode it me like a truck last week and I’ve never struggled so much to do college work. I feel so insanely guilty for not doing as much as I’d hoped (before my mood took a turn). I’m not going to college tomorrow because I just can’t do it. I’m too exhausted and anxious. But I feel incredibly guilty. 

I’m the past, even when depressed and self harming, I kept up straight As and A*s and never missed a day. These days my depression hits differently and I feel incapable of anything. I feel guilty for not being able to keep up like I used to be able to. It feels like I’m being lazy and giving up without trying. Like my mental illness is just a big excuse because I can’t be assed to do a bit of easy work. 

How do I keep up my college work while feeling like utter shit, and how do I stop feeling guilty for being ill?",02Nov2020,1

13,"so growing up i never had any rules, literally none, and it got to a point (which this is fucking disgusting my mother is horrible for not punishing us for this) where i ended up fucking my sister at the age of 8, not to mention the fact that the first time i actually ejaculated was while my sister was watching, teaching me how to masturbate, i don't even like to consider it my first time having sex i like to believe im just a virgin but anyway, it makes me extremely uncomfortable because she will straight up take her shirt off with me in the room and shit and its disgusting, and its not even like shes a milf or anything, we're trailer trash, which means she looks like honey booboos mom, she kept talking about how she knew who my favorite pornstar was and now im an adult and realizing how absolutely fucked up and dysfunctional this shit is, i want to move out but i was never tought anything, fucked up part is whenever i was caught fucking my sister all she said was ""they're experimenting"" like WHAT THE FUCK, and its not even just the incest shit thats a problem, im an adult and this woman lets me smoke weed saying the same shit ""hes experimenting with drugs"" like bullshit im not experimenting im smoking weed because in the moment I forget how fucked up my past is, i fucking hate that i lost my virginity to my sister, i hate that my mom doesn't care about this stuff and even encouraged sexual stuff as kids


i just want to be a normal functioning family, i wish I would have had rules, im just glad i was able to realize how fucked up this was

14,"So I have acute BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), for those not in the know, in layman’s terms it means sufferers have go through emotional extremes. Happiness is much greater when you feel good, sadness is much worse (and has led to depression and anxiety in my case). 

But I wanted to vent a little over feelings I’ve had, and the ongoing battle I’m having. Namely, I suffer severely with anger and have a really bad temper when I blow (something I have learned to control much more in my day to day life thankfully). But when I do suffer my explosive anger, I have nowhere to direct it outwards, namely cause it happens more so at night when I have nowhere to go. So I cannot just go for a run or something. 

But one of the ongoing thoughts that I have regarding this, I really want to just pick a fight with someone, or start being bullied again (I suffered bullying throughout my childhood and teens for some clarity). So I want to either kick the shit out of someone, or have the shit kicked out of me, or be belittled in some way. Probably to give me some outside source for my anger rather than all this emotion being directed inwards. 

I have no way to express the anger and have to cage it due to living with very conservative parents. They understand mental illness but I just have no way to direct the anger out, unlike other emotions. With sadness I’ve learned to meditate or listen to music, making it much easier to deal with. 

But anger is the one issue, and its hard to not just explode. Writing this now I can feel my hands shaking slightly, and my veins throbbing in my neck. There’s just nowhere for it to go and it frustrates me even more. Its nearly 1am and I have nothing to do about the anger. 

TL;DR struggling with anger partially due to BPD, and want to either fight someone or be beaten up and bullied",02Nov2020,1

17,"When I was younger I saw alot of people that had mental health issues and never saw myself getting there. What could go wrong? Family was good, I had everything I need in life, etc Fast forward to about 15 years later in my freshman year of college. I had a dwindling social circle that 100 percent was not my fault, in a whole new way of life and then just more drama that I had no control over. 

A couple newer friends from back home that were slightly older than me and going to the same school came into my life. It was nice, we were similar in many ways and two of them experience the same hardships. I felt a bit more assured knowing that I can relate 

Later on I went home after not feeling right and was diagnosed with depression, it sounds bad but I was kinda getting close to killing myself and one of my friends called and said dont and invited me over to talk things out. Very big adjustment and a bit of a shock as I did not think I was that bad but I did have alot of stress built up,trouble sleeping, etc. I did be open with my mental health to who ever I could so that it was not like im being rude for no reason or look upset for nothing. I had a few others who slightly struggled help me too. 

Sophmore year I had a seizure probably from a drug for depression I was taking and was diagnosed with epilepsy that day basically. A couple months after that I find myself anxious, stressed out, upset, etc. I feel completely lost and defeated in life. The people that I met in college kind of distanced themselves from me I personally feel due to my mental health. I was never physically abusive, verbally abusive, rude etc, I just came off as too much. I loved hanging out with them because A. they helped me at a time when I felt like nothing was going to help me and B. They were genuinely interested in being friends. I never thought any of them would go as far as a relationship but who knows on that one. 

I just wish in the moment depression could not kill my chances with anything and I could see people again and make things right.",02Nov2020,1
18,"While Halloween already came by, and some others are honoring their deceased there sure are many scary and epic costumes for this year; however, what's most scary is the image in the mirror because you cannot run from yourself, and sometimes that's all that you have. Even though this year has been harsh on most from one way or another, is also important to remember to nurture your inner strength and will since that's the voice that keep you going; so, the next time you look into a mirror smile, and if you can't or just don't feel it then look into your eyes till you see that sparkle of joy, otherwise visualise that inner strength in you and keep moving forward step by step.",02Nov2020,1
19,"Hi, to start off I'm a 20 year old male and I'm so happy to say that I came out today as bisexual to one of my closest friends because of some events that followed up before that. Basically I've been depressed, anxious and had suicidal thoughts the past few months, yesterday I decided to open up to my friendship group about feeling depressed and suicidal mainly and they were all very supportive and cared for me it made me so happy and earlier today my closest friend asked me how I was and I told him I needed to get something off my chest and I told him I was bisexual, and again he was so very supportive and even told me that he was happy for me and I cried of happiness/joy when he told me. He's the only person I've told because I'm not ready to open up about being bisexual yet to the rest of my friends, I might open up to them in about a week or so I just need to prepare myself for it.

I'm just so thankful for these amazing friends in my life and I don't ever want to lose them.

20,"It takes a lot to make me cry. The last time I cried was over a year ago when I was stood up on a date by a girl who I really liked and my mom called me the worst and most defiant son ever all within 2 weeks.

Well, I finally cried today. It was difficult to let myself do it; it felt wrong. My body kept automatically stopping, but my mind wanted to scream. Everything this year had been building up like bags on a camel's back, and tonight was when the camel could take it any more and had to lay down.

I expected so much chaotic beauty from this year. Everything was set up for a super exciting time in my life. Graduation, exploration of college life, making new friends, and other big steps were lined up to be a new chapter for me. I knew a cute girl at my college. I was ready to start Greek life. I had huge plans for projects in my free time that would help me learn new skills. It was all bound to be great.

I am in the class of 2020. I had a weird graduation 3 months late. My ""freshman experience"" has been sitting in my room 10 hours a day doing online college. As everyone knows, literally everything this year has gone wrong. What would a full online student expect other than his power to go out for 4 days?

Most of my classes are fine, but one class where I barely have an A is not fine. I had very little time to do the homework due to not having power, and the professor was not very sincere about helping me. Once I had power again, I spent all of Halloween night working to complete the homework but ended up with a 30% because I ran out of time. Up until this point, I have made excellent grades, but this will take my A to a B.

I cried because it is all too much. Everything could have been so exciting yet so simple. I cried because I could have been so happy during such a fun time in my life. I could have talked to that cute girl, built those projects, and had normal classes. Even my back up plans are getting destroyed by disasters. I kept telling myself that my mental health and well being are more important than any grade in college, and it only made me want to cry more. Although my body wanted to act normal, my mind was having a meltdown.

2020 finally made me cry because it hasn't been anything close to what I had in mind. I will not have a chance to do any of this stuff again (especially that homework). It sucks.",02Nov2020,1
21,"Hey guys! (21F) I just wanted to share my experience with battling depression and how the past 3 years have gotten so much better because of not having to face to immense pressure that society puts on teens!

I know everybody’s situation is different but I’m hoping I can brighten up someone’s outlook on life!

First I just wanna adress that like not enough adults talk about how hard it is to be 14-18! These years were honestly the toughest ones so far. I hear all these older middle-aged people like “oh you’re too young to be stressed out”

But society puts so much pressure on teens. Teachers and parents want you to have your career and university picked out in like grade 9, and they expect you to be on top of your game all the time no matter how hard going on in your personal life. Kids at school act as if there’s some social hierarchy that everybody fits into, employers treat teens like crap kuz they can get away with it, and on top of that social media can be so bad for mental health!

Ever since I got out of highschool my mental health has been so much better. Id love to hear your guys opinions on this 😝 There’s hope guys! Love you all 😊❤️❤️❤️",02Nov2020,1
22,"I don’t even know where to start. I’m starting to write this on Tuesday, October 27th. Over the last few months my already shitty life took a plunge into hell. Without going into too much detail, I lost someone very close to me earlier this year. This was not my first loss, that happened a year prior to this. In between those 2 deaths I have lost 8 other people, all of which I felt I could depend on. 
Today is Wednesday, October 28th. After losing him, my mind went to a very dark place and I almost took my own life. My mother stopped me and saved my life and I thought that was the end of it and my life would finally start looking up. Looking back, I was very gullible. Soon after my mom and my grandma had a fight that ended up getting me, my parents, and my 3 siblings getting kicked out. Now I live in a veeeery low income family so we couldn’t afford an actual house, we ended up living in a 2 bedroom apartment. Anyone who’s had to share a tiny room with even one person should know how stressful it can be, imagine sharing a room with three. 
Today is Thursday, October 29th. My dad got upset today and now I have a brand new gash on my nose. Anyway, ever since we moved in here stress has been on a constant rise for everyone in the house. Luckily, for a few months, my friend started to take care of me and let me stay in his house for a few days at a time. I would be on and off living with him for a few months, spending time with my family while also taking time for my mental health. Once again, I thought things were finally looking up for me.
Today is Friday, October 30th. I was stupid to let myself think I was allowed to be happy. Earlier this month, my friends grandma passed away and I attended the funeral. Guess what virus also attended? So I do what any reasonable child would do and called my mom to let her know I had to quarantine for 2 weeks expecting a calm conversation. Nope, I was wrong again. She blew up on me over the phone for “taking an unnecessary risk”. I didn’t talk to either of my parents for the two weeks, it was honestly the calm before the storm.
Today is October 31st, happy Halloween. As soon as I walked back into my home after the 2 weeks were up I got greeted with a glass bowl to the head followed by a screaming match. Needless to say I’m no longer allowed to even speak to my friend, and it feels like I’ve lost someone else I could trust in. 
Today is November 1st. Things only got worse from there. I’ve been home a week now and while I’m glad to see my siblings are eating well, I am not. The amount of times I’ve seriously considered ending my own life is terrifying, the lack of food going into my body is terrifying, and the thoughts going through my head even as I type this is terrifying. I need help but I don’t where to get it. Someone please help me",02Nov2020,1

24,"Just wondering if anyone else deals with this and knows how to handle it. I'm in year 11 at the moment, and honestly school just drains me like hell. Its pretty difficult, I find with homework especially I get a lot of anxiety and sometimes suicidal thoughts. I deal with the thoughts pretty regularly and I have self harming tendencies, though it isn't as bad as it used to be. I usually avoid homework since I don't really want to feel that way, I can work in school but that's because I really dissociate and numb myself to it. Which in itself isn't a good thing. I take therapy, but I was just wondering if anyone else had similar experiences or knows how to deal with it. I'll probably bring it up in therapy but I was just wondering. I've had to be dealing with this for years, and it increasingly got worse. I think now is a better time to deal with it though because I'm no longer living in a really bad environment. Though at the moment I'm pretty nervous about going back to school without having done anything. And with this whole covid thing, it's just more stressful in school. I feel like I'm going to break.

25,"Im so tired of waking up with a headache in the morning from the constant crying at night and only getting like 3h of sleep at best. Im so tired of constantly overthinking everything that comes out of my mouth. Doesn‘t matter if it’s a coworker, boss, friends at school or my parents. I feel like everything I say makes people dislike me or even hate me. When I talk to my friends I feel like all of them secretly hate me. And if anything were to happen where we would have to split up it‘d be me who would stand alone since I‘m the fifth friend in our group. Im so tired of constantly being this person that im not even really sure is me. It’s gotten to the point where I question myself „wait, how do I normally react to this“ or „do I or do I not enjoy reading?“. Because I haven’t done it in months and I actually love to read, well at least I think so. But lately these past few months I have just become so tired of everything, I got tired of reading, tired of cooking (which i enjoyed doing for a while), of eating, as soon as i get home i skip dinner and go straight to bed and miss the evening i could have spent with my family but then again my parents and i don’t really have the best relationship where I think a lot of my selfdoubt has originated but let’s not get into that now.

though, unfortunately my ex fiance is my ex for a reason now, because after some time she ended up killing herself so yeah, i really feel i could have done something about it but i don't know, all the doctors were doing was giving a person who attempted to overdose more pills that extensively fucked her up more, now they've been giving me pills that are fucking me up and my career so i said fuck it and stopped taking that shit, they refuse proper therapy so yeah fuck me i guess, i just, i cant believe shes actually gone",02Nov2020,1

31,"I’ve told my friends about this but they just keep telling me to see a medical professional, which I have done. It didn’t help - my feelings and thoughts remain unchanged.

My life is going pretty well. I’m financially stable, have amazing friends which I love, I’m working towards a degree in a field which I love. But nothing feels rewarding. And the worst thing is - there’s nothing bad either. 

Everything is going smoothly towards goals that I’ve set throughout earlier education (aside from the few things I fucked up on purpose to see if anything bad would change my mindset - it didn’t) 

I’ve accomplished a lot through my short life. I’ve made money, I’ve won competitions, I have a few scholarships. And all of these things I looked forward to and pushed towards but when they happened, there was no pride. There was no joy, there was just nothing.

I have quite a lot to feel happy about but I just don’t. My life just feels empty. It feels like there’s no reason for me to go through with everything if there will never be a pay-off.

I have plans in place for a suicide. I’ve had these thoughts for at least 4 years now and throughout that time I’ve meticulously planned every part of how I’d end my life if I decided I wanted to.

32,"**Here is what's going on with my friend, who I'll call Riley:** 

She quit her job in Japan, where she has been living the last 7 years, and moved back to the States in April. Huge change. Her original plan was to live with her parents (who she has a close relationship with), take some time off to write and decompress, then look for a job. Unfortunately, she happened to go through this major life transition in the very beginning of COVID. 

When she came back to the states, she immediately felt isolated and extra anxious about finding a job.  Totally understandable, I don't know anyone who hasn't been feeling those things. She has been struggling with anxiety over the past few years, and it has absolutely gotten worse during quarantine. She has a therapist, and he has recommended she go on medication, but she's in denial about things being ""that bad"" and doesn't think she needs it. 

Since she's been home, she has relied on me and our mutual friend for emotional support. I felt horrible that I couldn't come visit her due to COVID or help make this transitional time easier for her, so I tried to set up a weekly skype date so she'd have something to look forward to each week. When things got particularly bad, I convinced my housemates to rent an RV with me and drive over 2,000 miles to go visit my friend. 

While I was visiting Riley, I was going to be staying with my parents &amp; brother, all of whom are severely immunocompromised. I asked my friend to be extra cautious and mindful of COVID protocols for the 2 weeks I was in town, and she agreed that she would, but she wasn't. She went out to eat a few times (indoors) with her parents, who don't believe in wearing masks. The last straw for me was two days before I was going to leave, when Riley went out to dinner and then to get drinks at a bar for her mom's birthday. 

It was a slap in the face to me. I told her I was disappointed and angry with her for not keeping her word to me - it was only two weeks! - especially when I had gone so far out of my way to come visit her. (Also, side note: our state is currently having one of the worst outbreaks in the country.) 

In response to my expressing frustration with her, she got mad at me. We took a break and didn't talk for a week. Point to her, though - we eventually did have a conversation where she apologized (genuinely) for not taking it more seriously. 

**Here is what's going on with me:** 

My brother entered hospice on Saturday. I flew across the country (to my hometown, where Riley is currently living) to be with him and help my parents take care of him (they aren't in the best of health, so while I am home I take on the role of his primary caretaker - all the feeding, adult diaper changing, med-giving, lifting, head-rubbing, etc). My brother cannot walk or talk, has seizures and requires 24-hour care. It's exhausting. It's heartbreaking. He has been given days to weeks to live, and it's so hard to watch him suffer. I am grieving while trying to be strong for him and my parents. 

He's in incredible pain. It is a slow, horrible death. But I know I am lucky to *be* with him right now when so many people are dying alone of COVID. (to clarify: my brother is not dying of covid - he is dying of inoperable cancer which has become necrotic and is now leaking poison into his body after a recent surgery. He was paralyzed and had a brain injury before this. I have taken care of him as though he were my own son for most of my life. He is the most important person on this planet to me.)

**Here is what happened between Riley and I:** 

Context? This was 3 days after flying home last weekend. After driving from the airport directly to the hospital to stay by my brother's side. After not sleeping more than 2 hours at a time for 3 days because I was his guardian/representative and I knew he was in immense pain but paralyzed and unable to talk, so I needed to be able to advocate for him if he needed me to. 

On day 3, knowing exactly what was going on with my brother, Riley sent me and our mutual friend a page of texts talking about how hard her life is. Literally stuff like how ""Aaron doesn't call, Mike doesn't want to be my friend, I don't have a job, I miss Japan, etc"". 

This is normal for her. These vent texts happen at least 2x/week, but sometimes more, and I normally don't mind them at all. On this occasion, though, I didn't have it in me to provide emotional support. I was absolutely dead tired, and overwhelmed with end-of-life caregiving. So I responded to her text with something like ""mhm, that sucks I'm sorry."" 

I genuinely meant that, it wasn't sarcastic. I thought her original text was tone-deaf but honestly, I understood. She's going through a shitty time, just like the rest of us (I also don't have a job and have been strapped for cash and am just generally not doing well, so I get it.) I don't think my stuff is the only valid shit going on, people struggle in their own ways and it's not a competition. I was just too tired to help her through her stuff right now, but I wanted her to know I heard her. 

She responded to my 'mhm' text with ""whenever people reply 'mhm' i think they're mad at me."" 

At this point, she's becoming exhausting. And frankly a bad friend. But still, I replied: ""oh no i'm not at all"" 

It is at this point Riley sends another venting-style text about how she just feels like a drain on everyone. 

To which I responded that I cannot do this right now. That I am going through too much right now to help her through her anxiety. I can't do it. I just can't. I'm not trying to be dismissive of her but I have too much going on to help her through this and I need her to try to do it on her own.

She took great offense to this. 

Wanting to avoid a fight with her, I tried to move on and change the conversation. But she kept. Bringing. It. Up. I told her flat-out that I wasn't mad. That we were cool. That it's not a big deal. That I wasn't trying to be mean. That I was just spread too thin right now but I'm sorry she's going through such a hard time and I hate that for her. 

I tried twice to squash it. I moved on, sent memes, changed the subject. She kept bringing it up. So I told her I was taking a break from talking to her for the rest of the night so we could cool off, but that it was NOT that big of a deal and I just wanted to move on. 

The next morning, I woke up to a long text about how I was a bad friend, how she never asked me to help her handle her anxiety, and how she feels like she can't say anything to me right now. 

That was the last straw for me. 

I told her that the fact we were STILL talking about this and she was STILL bringing this up and not letting it go (after I told her point-blank that I WASN'T MAD AND WE WERE COOL AND I JUST WANTED TO SQUASH IT) was a sign that her anxiety had boiled over to a place where she had become self-obsessed. 

I told her I was sick of coddling her and her feelings, and I can't believe she was asking me to do that when I'm going through so fucking much right now. 

I told her you don't have to 'ask' someone something in the form of a question — and the fact that my 'mhm' response was met with more neediness from her was a sign that she absolutely was asking for help and was expecting more aid from me at that time. 

She responded to that by saying ""I'm done being verbally abused by you. I guess i'm just a shitty friend who can't say or do anything right ever. I'm done."" Etc etc.

I asked two people to read over the exchange and tell me if I was blind to some form of verbal abuse on my end. They were both horrified by Riley's behavior throughout our exchange. 

Her recent behavior, in my opinion, is bad enough to be a friendship-ender. I know she's going through a lot right now, but so am I and to be completely honest? So is *everyone.* Not having a job right now isn't a Riley thing. It's an American thing. Hell, a human, COVID-era thing! (Side note: I have reached out to several people on Riley's behalf to help her get a job. I have even gotten her a part-time job with my longest-running freelance client.) 

**Tl;dr:**

My best friend of 10 years, Riley, is unable to see or admit that her anxiety is making her a bad friend. It is always, *always,* someone else not being sensitive enough to her needs. She cannot handle anyone disagreeing with her at all. My brother entered hospice this week and she tried to make me feel guilty for not being a better friend to HER right now because she doesn't have a boyfriend or a job and she has anxiety that she won't take meds for. When I told her I couldn't give her emotional support, she snapped at me.  When I tried pointing out how her behavior is out of line and hurtful, she accused me of being verbally abusive (which is just objectively not true.) 

I don't know how to forgive her for picking a fight with me and being so self-absorbed during this incredibly painful time in my life. I feel like her behavior is unbelievably selfish, but I am unable to make any comment to her that isn't 100% supportive and positive, so I don't know how to heal this wound in our friendship or move on in a more healthy way.

**Questions:**

Should I try to be more understanding because she is struggling with her mental health? 

Do you think this can be salvaged? 

Have you been through anything similar? 

Any perspective/thoughts/advice is welcome. I'm struggling. I don't want to lose what I considered to be a best friend right now, but I also feel like she might be turning out to be kind of a shitty person. Can't tell if that's her mental health or just her and can't tell if that matters.",02Nov2020,1
34,"17, M, and talking about something that's been on my mind.

For the past four to five years, I've been having add visions or dreams of sorts, most taking reality and fantasy combined together. Most of the recent are more so just darkness and odd color pallet shapes and sizes. They, almost make faces, masks or even things I can only imagine about. Faces that are either familiar, or made up and somehow memorable without reason. Most of them had no other expression, other than apathetic, traumatized, and neutral. Not only that, some have made me noises that were familiar or imagined by me.

These noises started from hearing a family member call for help, to eerie train brakes echoing or even a wail from some odd monster. They just, happen. No warning, no reason why, but just happen. Then came the shocks.

The shocks are what worry me a lot. They are what I fear most: Thoughts of death. Father told me recently that death is not the one wanting us to submit into their hands, but the one that awaits to help us whenever we do pass away. They guide us to the gates and stairs he said, because he himself almost met death many times at work. Thinking about death even for a moment, brings fear, and I don't know why it makes me jump from my bed and gasping for air. I don't know why, and just wish it could stop.",02Nov2020,1
35,"So, I got a job as a wfh call center employee. The thing is, making phone calls is one of my major triggers. So I made sure that I found a job that didn't require outbound phone calls. Knew that it was still a risky venture. But my physical health demands that I switch fields and with covid-19 that means wfh due to asthma triggers. (as I only have retail experience plus HS diploma, jobs I qualify for are limited).

So, a week into actually helping customers, using a VoIP phone system, I find that at the start of each shift, when I go to turn the live calls on, my anxiety spikes and I slow down (I freeze, not fight or fright). But once I get going I'm good (I have no problem answering the phone). And sometimes this also happens when returning from a break.
I'm not used to being able to dealing with this type of regular anxiety spike. I know/assume it's not a reason to increase my meds. And not really a reason to start therapy again.
What I'm looking for is tips for dealing with the spike and working past it, beyond deep breaths. (also not pot or pot related products)",02Nov2020,1
36," 

I am a 17-year-old and my parents are driving me nuts.

my parents are business owners and I usually help them out and work for them every once in a while. so they just called me when I was half asleep and asked if I could work for them because I just went on a camping trip with my boyfriend. I normally don't have a problem working for them, but when I went to ask about important details like, ""how many hours will I work?"" or ""how much will I get paid"" they wanted to act as if I was ungrateful for their offer and automatically brought up the camping trip and how I had already had a weekend. while yes I agree I already had a fun weekend, I technically have a four day weekend and a decent amount of homework to do. Monday and Tuesday were the days I was planning to get all of it done.

so I started to try to bargain with them and say I have stuff I need to do they tell me if I had so many things to do then I shouldn't have gone on a camping trip. this is not the first time they have used this logic with me. the fact that the second they allow me to be a teenager, they only use it as something to guilt me into doing things for them. they are corroding my mental health. the only time I feel like a real person is when I am with my boyfriend. I'm just so sick and tired of constantly feeling as though I'm not allowed to live. I'm over feeling like shit every time I have the chance to have fun. I'm so ducking ready to get out of this damn house.",02Nov2020,1

38," Hi all, 

i have just released some writing about my own experiences of mental health, accessing mental health services, and the early beginnings of my recovery (the rest to come later). My work is held on a non-profit blog (no advertising or promotional material), which tries to bring technical information and personal experience together. 

The situations which created my loss of hope are detailed in parts one and two, but these sections are about my experience of environmental collapse and corporate culture and do not talk about personal mental health impacts extensively.  

The third section is called '3.0 *No end game*'. This a short description of a loss of hope that occurred as a result of the experiences described in sections one and two. 

Part 4.0, 'Falling through the cracks' may be triggering for some individuals. It does contain an explicit discussion of suicidality. Every effort has been made to balance that perspective with a view from a happier mindstate, but it may still be troubling for some people. Out of respect for that fact, i will not provide a link to the pages in question, but to the home page.

The remaining three explain the hope which helped me get through this experience. The hope i describe is hope in the Australian society of today, and the capacity of technical systems to guide it to a better place.

42,"So i guess i'll just spew out my life story here.  
Im 17 living in a small town in us and whenever i was a kid i was pretty smart. Grades 1-5 i was getting all As and people were talking about moving me up grades and throwing around words like ""potential"", ""Gifted and talented"" all that jazz. I also didnt have too much of a social life, i was pretty much your average nerd.     
Then in 2015 i spent just shy of a year in a sort of group home. I dont want to get into specifics but my parents are still here and there great and loving people. Im not really sure if it started there or just before but thats about when i started getting a bit closed off, and where my depression really started kicking in. Not that the people there werent nice enough. Anyway the first thing that started showing up even before was me consistantly doubting if im making the right decision. Then once i actually got into there it ramped up to the point i could barely pick an outfit without regreting it 5 seconds later, this led my self esteem/ Self worth to take a nosedive that it really hasnt come back up from. This is where i started thinking suicidal thoughts s though i never did anything. When i finnally got out of there and back home for a few months it was good. Then Adhd just had to come crash the party  
I started missing assignments. Ecspecially long term projects where you were supposed to work on it at home. My grades dropped and i developed anxiety about basically any school work. The small fortune is that i started to develop real friends.   
The reasons for keeping it all bottled up changed over time. From ""I should be able to beat this"" to ""how am i gonna make any friends like this"" to ""My problems arent as bad as other peoples"" and finnaly to ""I dont want to be more of a burden.  
Somewhere around 2018 i started feeling extreme guilt, for decisions i made i the past, and every little mistake i was making.   
I got to highschool and unlike whats on tv, nothing much changed. Though, this past year or so everythings mmanaged to hit rock bottom. I think constant self hating thoughts i have developed this gigantic fear that i am/will fail at everything i do. I feel like im a burden on my family and everyone i know. I cant se any reason why anybody loves or even likes me. I feel like ive already wasted so many chances and i cannot undeestand why i keep getting more. My anxiety has gotten so bad it actually gets in the way of me doing work. 
Ive never really had a ""coping mechanism"" per say i really just struggle through the school day and as soon as i get home shove my face in a book, a game, or Youtube and try to hide from my problems. Its not working anymore. I need help but im so fucking afraid that ill just be more of a burden that everyone will see what im really like. I dont know what to do i dont know how or why ive managed to hold on it s physically hard to type this is there anyway i can stop myself i let go of thr end of my rope a long while ago.

44,"So ive been though a pretty tough time especially this year. Ive always struggled with depression, anxiety, and social anxiety. To get past my many issues with myself and my complete self loathing. Or at least cover it from the world i had to create little personas thag i would apply mentally to get through a situation. I often talk to them as if they are someone with me and as if they play a role in my decisions. I used to go through almost weekly mental breakdowns and eventually they would only happen when really stressed or lonely. It seems my depression thrives in my lonelyness. This all bundled up to me being almost incapable of many emotions. I dont express easily and i often obsess over little details.
This year has been really rough; I was dissowned by half of what I thought was family. I ended up finding out that i was lied to my whole life about who my dad was and seeing I dont have a mom ive basically become even more lonesome. Ive also made the decision to join the military in order to get on my feet personally. With that being said my emotional unavailability had hurt my relationship and my and my gf of 3 years split. Recently i had begun talking and becoming closer with a good friend and someone I had interest in the past and of course my obsessive side had driven my feelings for her right back up from the grave and now the more I find out about her love life the more and more I hurt. Ive got two weeks till I leave for basics; in this time ive been feeling like i should be having a breakdown every night. But for some reason all of my emotions except lonelyness, hate, and sadness are kinda dead. I feel almost numb. Ive had the thought of suicide in the past and have never acted on it due to being afraid of hurting others. And even then i didnt feel this dead inside. I feel like im spiralling down, and i believe my past family issues have caused ptsd as i now have a nightmare every once in a while. I seriously dont know what to do.

Before I just felt really shit, locked up myself in my room and stuff. I still feel really down but also kind of empty. My mind has been really foggy, I haven’t slept much and everything feels like it’s just happening.
I finished two essays. Usually I struggle really hard to get them done. I get lost in other things I want to do like reddit. But now it’s like I don’t care what’s happening. I don’t care what has happened or what is going to happen or what is happening now kind of.

it's a tremendous feeling of being on square one when people i knew growing up have families now and entire networks and i literally don't have a single friend.  in other ways, to compare our lives i'm not always the one coming up short, in fact this is about the only part of my situation where i've got nothing to show.  it's incredibly crucial though.  whenever i can, i'll be joining group activities and talking to strangers and doing pretty much anything to get some kind of social life.

My sister who is now in her mid 40s always had problems with things not being up to her taste or standard or the way she wanted/envisioned but she had this thing with food especially ever since she was a child. We aren’t from first world country so parents and family never thought that it could be a psychological issue. But she’s well in her 40s now reaching 50 soon and boy does she has problems with the quality of food, the way it smells, the way it’s cooked and what not. She was hardly happy with whatever our mom cooked and often her food issues were the first episode of her going into depression. She spent years in depression not letting anyone to help her. So going to a mental health professional is impossible. She would get angry with mom for not cooking good food that there used to be big drama every frickin’ day. Mom would literally take trays of food to her and she would throw food away. For example we could never fry egg or fish in home because it would annoy her so much that she would bang doors or close herself in the room. She has depression/anxiety issues but she never accepts it, never wants to hear about it, doesn’t want to take any medication or even go for counseling.

55,"I have a steady but stressful career as a teacher in a city that eats most of my pay for rent. I'm paying down student loans and a couple thousand credit debt with whatever little I can scrape together each month; sometimes that's nothing.

I've been here six years and have made no friends outside of work. I have work friends I've done things with in the past, but it's hard because they all have families and children, so even without COVID in the way, it's hard to do anything with them, anyhow.

Until this past year, I was in decent physical shape. I used to do bike racing every summer and spent a lot of time on the weekends during the school year training. It was good exercise and I felt good.

I gained 40lbs over the summer. I also started drinking a lot during some weeks, for no good reasons. Sometimes because I was sad and wanted to numb myself. Sometimes just boredom. The summer was bad because I had more time, but I've come home from work and poured myself a drink when this was previously never a thing. Yay for alcoholic tendencies (that I never struggled with before).

(That's improved at least since choosing to simply not to buy alcohol, save for what I sometimes cook with.)

My co-workers have noticed the weight gain and despite putting on my best mask, my depression, and expressed concern. I was given some names of people to see, but I can't because of money.

Insurance through work completely sucks. There are literally no in-network therapists or psychiatrists, and while my prescriptions are covered pretty well, seeing a doctor every month or so just to check in and be able to get refills can cost hundreds. I had a therapist for a while, and the price was reasonable, but last year he left the practice he was with to start his own and his price more than doubled.

More than a decade ago, I was in a car accident and suffered a brain injury that I mostly recovered from; since then, I've been on a mild anxiolytic, and that's been pretty good until this year. When I moved here, I had been taking a stimulant to help stay awake, and noone here will prescribe it to me since it's a controlled substance. For six years I've struggled to get through most days; weirdly, that didn't bother me a lot until this year, since coffee/tea helps and when I'm not depressed and during a normal school year, I can muster the energy to get through the day. Now that I'm depressed and teaching to students' backs or to a camera, it's just the caffeine, which doesn't help my anxiety and doesn't get me far enough by itself.

I feel lost and trapped and alone. I don't think I want to die, but I find myself on the worst days thinking that it'd be a nice release if I didn't wake up, or if a car swerved across the highway and hit me on the way home from work. I feel like crying myself to sleep most nights and I just don't have the tears or something. I lie in bed with knots in my stomach and butterflies until I fall asleep.

I know how I feel, at least when I can remember, but don’t know what words to use so I can do my own research or have a proper convo with my counsellor. Is there a single term out there or is it just a common group of symptoms? Am pretty clueless here.",02Nov2020,1
61,"All of my friends say that mental health medication does wonders for them. For their anxiety and their depression, everyone says that this stuff helps.

I've tried two types of medication: Buspirone and Lexapro. I've never been diagnosed with anything, but my GP prescribed them because I had described some anxiety and depression symptoms, I suppose. Lexapro made me suicidal within a few days, maybe a week, but maybe that was a placebo-feeling? And then Buspirone made me so dizzy I could barely function normally. And neither seemed to do anything.

I'm wondering if I should try again, though. It sounds so...*good*. From what I've heard. Maybe I just didn't try long enough. But then again, I doubt anything will help. I'm just stupidly pessimistic about most things, and medication is one of them. Like, how much better could it be? Does medication truly help? Will it get rid of these symptoms, or help them:

* Complete Apathy / Emotional Numbness
* Inability to Write (I'm a writer) \[lasting weeks on end\]
* Sudden Panic \[lasting a few seconds to hours; multiple times a day\]
* Inability to Sleep
* Constantly Tense

Amongst other things, these are some of the most annoying symptoms. I wish they would go away so I could just write and write and *write* because I *adore* writing. But sometimes I can't. Sometimes I pull up the document and I *want* to write and nothing comes. I just feel hollow instead. Other days, I don't want to write and I fucking hate it. Those days, though, I hate everything.

I'm just not sure if it'll work, though. I don't want to end up *that* suicidal again. From the Lexapro, earlier. Nor do I want to be non-functioning dizzy, from the Buspirone. But I'm just...so tired of being tired. And I want something to work.

But then again, something in me says that I'm overexaggerating, and there's nothing wrong. I'm fine. I'm just being dramatic. I don't even know where I'm going with this...",02Nov2020,1

I have little to no control over it though.

65,"Well I broke up with my first real SO a while ago. A lot surrounded that relationship. Early 2020 I kind of did something bad. It ended up with me loosing both my best friends and almost my SO. Shit that felt bad. For maybe a week I was just apathetically laying in my bed. 

I wasn’t really the best boyfriend. I especially realize that afterwards. I wasn’t able to spend all the time I should with her. After us being together for quite a while. Corona started and I was so stressed about school I thought my head was gonna explode. I am in nature science and and she is in social. Nature science is A LOT harder. We have 5 math courses over 3 years and they have 2 (easier ones). So I don’t really think she understood how stressed I was. Plus I’m shit at dealing with it. So she took it as I didn’t want to be with here anymore. I explained that this wasn’t the case but she didn’t listen. And she started to get jealous at my female friends. And she started talking about how other guys could be better to her. 

I’m no Alfa chad so this really hurt me. Especially since I really liked her. And in waves I became really really depressed. Not even being able to get to open my phone in bed to attend lessons. Or sleep. This went on for a while. After a time I realized I didn’t even want to meet her anymore. It was always the same shit. After sex or cuddles when I thought everything was good she always said “we need to talk”. Which would ultimately induced another wave. When things got the baddest we decided to brake up. When that happened It was like a big old chain was removed. Although I really liked her I’ve learned my lesson. We started first dating because of love and sex. We didn’t really know each other before that. Which I think was a mistake.

I’ll never date a girl again that I haven’t become really good friends with first. Even though love was there we didn’t fit all that good together. Best friends and lovers.",02Nov2020,1

68,"
I just got quarantined for 2 weeks because one of my parents got the rona. And this just happened a few weeks ago too bc a friend got the rona. And it takes a massive fucking toll on my mental health. Like most kids my age hate school, but it makes me feel better. It gets me out and interacting with people that I wouldn’t otherwise. And I love talking to one of my teachers. We normally talk about just some random topic, but I always enjoy it. And it’s like a highlight for my whole day. 

Like what the hell is the point in saying “Oh but it’ll be better in 2 weeks so I’m not going to kms”? Because it will still only get a little better and my life will still be shit as soon as I step off that bus. And if I kms, that’s end. No more pain, no more suffering, just eternal darkness and I won’t even know I’m there, it’ll be like when I was a fetus. Just nothingness and you don’t even know you exist. So then I don’t have to deal with the 2 weeks of complete shit and then the rest of my pointless shitty life. 

I have to deal with constant screaming or them preaching about some bible shit or them fucking. Literally all I ever hear is those 3 things unless I deafen myself with music. And who will miss me? And why does it matter cuz it won’t effect me anymore. And so what? They will be sad for a little bit of time? I don’t care because I’ll be gone and it doesn’t fucking affect me. 

The only reason I’ve even made it this far is bc of my dog but he is getting old and I hate to see him how he is anymore. He used to love the fall and winter, and he won’t even be able to play in the leaves or snow this year, if he even makes it to the winter. Now he literally can’t even jump onto the footstool I keep by the couch for him. 

I’m sorry for wasting your guys time. Don’t even worry about all that shit like “don’t do it man, it gets better” because every time I’ve been told that it never gets better. I’m determined I’m doing it, I just wanted to tell someone. And since you guys don’t know me, I figured it would be best.",02Nov2020,1
69,"This is my first ever post, and pretty overwhelming for me, so please bear with me if I’m all over the place. 

I have struggled with mental health issues since I hit puberty at 9. Since then, my mental health has been in a steep decline, and being 20 now, I worry for my future self if I continue to allow my mental health to deteriorate at the rate that it is now. 

I was in therapy from age 11-18, and while it did help, it didn’t eliminate any of the strong emotions I felt. I continued to self harm until I was 14 (started at 10) and always felt too ashamed to talk to my therapist about something so personal. Recently, I have begun to self harm again, but in a different way than before. 

Previously, it usually required some thought, like going into the bathroom knowing what I was going in there for. Now, it is completely impulsive, and something that is almost impossible for me to control. It’s happening more and more frequently lately, and it’s starting to scare me. An example being last night, I had an anxiety attack in my car and began slamming my head onto the steering wheel, seriously bruising my face. I didn’t even realize that’s what I was doing until it was over. what the fuck is wrong with me?

I am increasingly paranoid, whether that be thinking my boyfriend of 5 years is cheating on me (he’s not, and there’s 0 evidence he ever has), or closing my blinds right when it gets dark because I believe someone is going to be out there watching me sleep. I also talk to myself often, more than I believe other people do. No one ever talks back, but I answer my own questions, and refer to myself as “we” in my thoughts, and when talking to myself. 

I have panic attacks often. These range from frantic breathing to uncontrollable self harm, and everything in between. These feelings of panic often occur in the morning, when I realize I have another entire day of thought and emotion ahead of me.

I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OCD before and have been on both Prozac and Lexapro at different times. Neither of these seemed to help me very much. I made an appointment with a psychiatrist today, listing those symptoms as what I need help with, because I don’t know what else this could be. I feel like there is something seriously wrong with me, and it’s so frustrating to have that brushed off as just being depressed. Even though I am depressed and anxious, what I’m feeling now goes so much deeper than that, and I feel like I’m losing control. I want to put a name to this so I am able to help myself better, and not just brushed off as having severe anxiety or depression.

I know there’s more to it than what I’ve been diagnosed with, but I don’t know how to help myself if I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I feel like I’m losing my mind quickly, and am scared of taking impulsivity too far. Please help me figure out what’s wrong with me.",02Nov2020,1

72,"I posted this in another subreddit as well.

I have recently entered high school and I noticed that I can’t stop doing things such as overthinking and worrying. I have noticed that hobby’s I have always loved my brain tells me to quit them and says people hate me for it. I’m also trying to get into some new hobby’s which I’m really struggling with because my mind won’t rest and always wants me to stop doing them even though I enjoy the hobby. My mind is constantly focused on if I do that who will hate me and my current status with my friends. If I don’t do anything with friends for at least 3 days usually I also feel completely separated and lonely even though it’s been three days. School does not make this any better because I tend to drift off in class and that’s when the thoughts get really bad and there is not much I can do at school. I miss the days where I would just do things and not care what others thought and would never overthink things and just live life. These thoughts get really emotional draining and when I’m too drained the thoughts still enter nonstop and make me do things such as this where I seek help from others. This is something I’m really afraid to tell my parents and friends about because I feel like they might not understand and say I’m overreacting and to suck it up or they would stop being friend with me. These thoughts tend to make it hard to feel like best friends with anybody which makes me think my friend might abandon me if I do something different. My school has a schedule set up ( because of covid ) to where I won’t see my friends at all one day but see them a lot the next and the day I don’t see them at all I always have anxiety for and very lonely. During these days I can’t stop the thoughts at all and I really hate them, sometimes I even tell my parents I want to e-learn instead that day because the comfort of my room can help me a bit, but they always say no because I’m too scared to tell them the whole reason why I don’t want to go to school. When I’m with friend however I feel like the burden was lifted even though right after they leave it’s back. I really wish I could manage to escape these thoughts permanently but no matter what I try they always come back and drain me emotionally and cause me to do things such as this where I write things such as this (on a alt account because I don’t want friends and family to find this). I really want these thoughts to stop but I’m to scared to tell anybody. I’m pretty sure nobody knows I even have problems such as these, they just think I’m lonely and shy when I choose to dodge conversations that spark these thoughts. Oh yeah I forgot to mention I also don’t tell anybody because I have really bad trust issues and don’t tell secrets to anybody no matter who they are. Anything I can do that might help me out even if it’s just a little. Also sorry if this was long this is the one time I can really write out how I feel (This isn’t all of it either this is just all I chose to put in because it was the worst parts).",02Nov2020,1

78,"In college I had my first panic attack. I was in the middle of class and was dealing with a suicidal ex the night before and I couldn't focus on class due to the awful worries in my head. He hadn't said he was going to kill himself that night but he was acting the same way he had when he said it in the past. I started feeling my heart rate accelerate and I actually excused myself from class to go to the bathroom where it got worse. I called my mom because I legitimately thought I was having a heart attack. She informed me it was a panic attack and talked me through it while I tried to calm down in the bathroom.

I had a few more over the following months and sought therapy services from my school which were free. I don't know that they helped much, but it did feel good to just rant to someone about my life and the things I felt. By the time I graduated 2 years after I had stopped having them though I was still incredibly depressed.

Ive been home for 3 years now and the past 2 I've been steadily pulling myself out of it. Despite all the crap of 2020 my mental health has mostly been stable if not maybe a little detached but I feel okay. 

Anyway I had been hanging out with an old friend of mine who I used to be fwb with and we went to a Halloween party yesterday (stupid I know please refrain from the covid comments) and as we were driving there I recognized the route... It was to a party house I had been to with my college ex. I was silently freaking out in the backseat trying to convince myself it wasn't the same house but it was... And then I tried to convince myself he wouldn't be there... He was. I immediately saw him and felt like I was going to faint. The old feeling of a panic attack set in again and I pulled my fwb aside and told him my ex was here. He said it was okay and to just stick close to him. I did and my ex noticed me but didn't say anything while I did my damnedest to avoid eye contact and was silently thankful I had caked on Halloween makeup so you couldn't see how red my face was.

now I've spent since last night basically unable to relax and unable to ease my anxiety.

I've been reviewing my past and have come up with some really disturbing ""symptoms"" of possible underlying problems. I need to know if these are things I should be concerned about or if I should only seek help if they begin to effect my current life negatively.

I'm not going to recount my whole life story, just some of the worrying things that my memory has dug up that don't seem to be pointing to positive things.

Trigger warning

- regularly tore out my own hair as a toddler to the point my mom shaved my head

- was sexually assaulted by my older sister at a very young age, leading to some disturbing sexual and physical daydreams/fantasies that I still carry with me to this day. (Gets better every year)

- phyically and mentally abused by same older sister throughout childhood (screaming, manhandling, pinching skin, pulling hair, throwing dangerous objects and threatening bodily harm, lying, manipulation of patents and siblings ect.)

- I intentionally became a ""buffer"" between same older sister and the rest of my younger siblings

- developed lying habit to protect myself and siblings
 
- never had freinds or played with anyone outside my family 

- developed a ""justice complex"" as my family calls it and spoke my mind openly about things that didn't seem right

- was suggested by highschool counselor to get ""professional help"" after recounting to her my day to day.... me and my mother both laughed

- have a weird need to feel ""abrasion"" on my skin, during one particularly emotional summer four years ago I walked by and ground my shoulder and arms into every tree I saw. Never drew blood, but just had a weird compulsion to feel something rough scrape against my skin. Same summer took a walk in the woods to clear my mind and whipped myself repeatedly with a raspberry vine till I was coverd in micro abrasions. I let cats tear up my hands and arms willingly and used to make sculptures with chicken wire so that my arms would be covered in scratches. I don't do this anymore since I recognized it as a potential problem but I still have vivid feelings/daydreams of my back and shoulders being whipped/beaten/slashed/shot.

- have never gotten along well with people and am outwardly emotionally/sexually repressed and inwardly sexually and emotionally unbridled. I'm getting better every year but I still feel incredibly distant from people, like I don't/can't understand their logic or reasoning.

- I haven't cried for 4 years but regularly find myself choked up over the weirdest things, (usually eating alone) can never cry though, my head begins to hurt massively and everything halts to stop the pain from growing.

- about a year ago, after a bad social encounter I drove home to my uncontrollable manic laughter. I couldn't stop, not till I pulled into my parking lot, and I was scaring myself.

So heres the thing: I am a functional adult with goals and ambitious. This stuff isn't causing me current harm or loss, it's just stuff that is. ""It is what it is""
But I am worried that if any of this gets mentioned/comes up that it will lead to me getting denied.

84,"My partner (31f) is very smart, articulate, and driven (when she wants to be) I love her and we get along great with these symptoms not getting in the way of our day to day most of the time.

She was severely abused as a child but appears on the outside (to everyone else atleast) to be an easy going, organized, and well adjusted adult.

We've been together for 5 years and I've noticed some oddities in her behavior, especially when she's stressed that are concerning to me. 

If she is alone in a room but its not normal self talk.. she mumbles and talks about things that aren't even happening or will just mumble and say certain words out loud that make no sense. She will stop if I come into the room but sometimes she does it when I'm around. 

She has a hair trigger temper and when we fight (which is rarely) its like she trys to stay calm, think things through and then makes a connection to something I've done that has nothing to do with the argument or topic and get so angry she has to excuse herself. She may or may not mumble to herself about the topic after she has left the room. If we are in public she doesn't do this and will behave normally.

She sleeps irregularly at night. She acts out violent nightmares and wakes up in sweats nightly. Often, she'll wake up and look out the windows or check all the locks. Once she told me she thought aliens were breaking in but has never brought up the subject again. If I ask her simply says she sleeps better when she's sure everything is locked up. But she needs a night light and will absolutely panic if she wakes up in a dark room.

Sometimes she crys sporadically. She will excuse herself to do this but she inconsolably sad for hours or days on end. She cannot go to work during these bouts.

Sometimes we will wake up in the morning and she wakes up but its like nobody is home. She'll either lay in bed or get up and move to the couch or the a chair in the kitchen and sit there for (anywhere from 2-24) hours without a phone, TV or book, just staring into nothing. I can talk to her during this but she reply with short yes, no and vague answers and doesn't engage in conversation. Its like she's gone. 

At my encouragement she started seeing a psychologist 4 years ago who suggested that she has severe depression and deeply rooted PTSD. Her psychologist mentioned that she hides her symptoms so well because she is a ""master manipulater"" something that was quite un-nerving to hear. 

She has active hobbies and a decent group of friends who she specializes with regularly. They do not notice any of these symptoms. I didn't notice them until we moved in together.

Her tharapist encouraged her to get on moodstabilizers and anti-depressants. But we soon found out she was allergic to SSRIs and she has been in medicated for 3 years.

During quarintine this last spring her symptoms worsened. It affected every aspect of her life. She was usually so diligent about her credit. She pays all of our bills and never missed a payment in the 4 years We've lived together. Over the course of a month all of that stopped. When she wasnt checked out, she was isolating in the house and taking to herself. Then she just disappeared on a hiking trip in the Serrias for 2 weeks and came back acting herself again. We agreed she needed to get on medication.

The new psychiatrist suggested went over her symptoms, came to the conclusion that she was not showing psychotic symptoms and suggested since she had ADHD as a child that adderall would level her out. So she did not get on moodstabilizers or anti-psycotics like we had previously talked about. She got on adderall and xanax. 

She never takes the xanax and thinks the adderall is gong great. I dont agree. Yes, she has been cleaning the house more, she seems happier and hasn't checked out mentally since she's been on it. Shes taking care of chores and her boss at work has told her that her work has improved significantly. She got a $11/hr raise as a result which is great for us since I was let go due to cutbacks. But her nightmares, self talks and erratic behavior is at a peak at home, along with some new and disturbing behavior. Her feet cramp uncontrollably and they curl inwards. It looks like the exorcist. She complains of how painful it is and has a hard time waking. She also just falls. Like just drops maybe 2-3 times a week and has no idea why. Shes covered in brusies. On top of that the adderal makes her sweaty, she smells like she's run a marathon at the end of every day. I'm worried she may be schizophrenic and the adderall is increasing her symptoms and that she is not eating as much on it causing her to experience these massive muscle cramps, body twitches and loss of coordination as a result. 

I'm worried for her and don't know how to get her help.",02Nov2020,1

I don't talk to co-workers or anyone else really except my husband. I've always been an introvert and never good with talking with people, but now it has turned into social anxiety.  I've lost motivation and drive to do a lot of things (at home and at work) and I feel physically exhausted all the time. It has gotten to the point that it has affected my concentration to do tasks and my mind is no longer as sharp or quick on the draw as it used to be. I also have a lot of crying spells or get agitated and angry very quickly about things. I just don't feel very happy about myself and some aspects of my life right now.

I'm really scared that I am just a ticking timebomb waiting to happen and that I am going to hurt any relationships that I currently have as well as possibly lose my job. I have been trying a few things to see if it will help, but it usually helps for a little bit and then I feel myself sliding back to where I was or worse. I am currently taking Buproprion for the depression, along with supplements for women's health and some specifically for my PCOS. I also see my therapist regularly. 

I guess I am just looking for feedback on what else I can try and do, because I am really wanting out of feeling like this. I don't know how much more of this that I can take.",02Nov2020,1
88,"Hi guys, I hope you're all doing well tonight.

It's kind of unusual for me to reach out like this. I'm all over the place, so apologies for anything confusing, etc. I'm feeling a bit isolated lately and just wanted to say hi and share my situation with you guys. Over the past 1-2 years, I've been struggling with accepting myself for who I am. I suffer from anxiety and low mood which has been seriously impacting my life. 

I'm doing a degree in Psychology (2nd attempt as last year was worse than 2020 for me...believe it or not!) and I need this to take priority...

From not being able to answer a phone call, to being convinced that I am one of the worst people I know. Every second of my life is riddled with bad thoughts, second guesses, and just negativity in general.

I'm spending my life questioning my own thoughts and actions so much. I feel I've become disconnected with myself (Assuming I was ever connected in the first place..). I don't have a passion, a hobby, or even the ability to relax...because I feel like I have *become* my mental health issues.

I'm losing my emotions to this disorder and it feels horrible. The only way I can feel safe is through unhealthy things. Things that bring about even more negativity. I've pretty much smoked my way through this pandemic,  I'm constantly worried about everything, yet from every perspective I take, I'm the only one creating the issues.

Sleeping is the worst. It's 5 am and I can't get to sleep. Thoughts of doubt and frustration flood my thoughts every time I close my eyes.

It's impacting my relationship, my education, my finances, and not to sound selfish or anything...but it's impacting **me**, and I want to stop it! 

How do I break this cycle??",02Nov2020,1

90,I’ve been dealing with some stuff in my life recently and just need someone to talk to and go to with my problems. I don’t have anyone in my life that I feel comfortable telling a lot of the stuff that I’d on my mind. If someone out there is willing to listen I would greatly appreciate it.,02Nov2020,1
91,"Apologies in advance if this is long winded but I needed to give some context. I (28M) have suffered from various mental health issues since the end of high school and have turned to Reddit many times over the years (mostly bookmarking a selection of other people’s helpful posts and supportive threads), but recently I’ve decided to engage more and felt the need post for myself this time. I’ve been through dark times before but right now it feels like I’m in the throes of a full blown mental/nervous breakdown, or having some kind of slow-burning panic attack, and I’ve never felt this bad before. 

&amp;#x200B;

There’s a lot of background but I’ll try and keep it succinct. I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD and depression and have been treating them with counselling and medication off and on for years. A couple of months ago I decided to come off my small dose of Fluoxetine (Prozac) for good, which has been difficult but largely steady. I have been surprisingly stable this year, mainly due to being extremely busy with study earlier in the year during our worst periods of lockdown/covid panic (I’m in Australia). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I find myself partially unemployed with a lot of free time and have been trying to be more involved online, posting more on Reddit, trying to find good online communities to join etc, in an attempt to stave off the feelings of isolation and not seeing friends often at the moment, as most people are. 

&amp;#x200B;

But something flicked like a switch a week or two ago and what started as a feeling of slight gloom and depression has become a deep sense of dread and anguish that is with me 24/7, from when I wake up to when I will myself to pass out. It feels like a plug has been pulled in my brain and the vortex of chaotic thoughts and worries are spiralling down the plughole, too confused and frantic to make any sense of. I’m grasping and some kind of thread to hold onto but it just slips through my fingers every time.

I’m juggling very personal, internal worries about my own existence, where I’m heading in life, what I should do with myself, how other people will view me and my accomplishments, and feelings of being generally behind, and massive external ones like where the world is heading, how insane politics and society are and how the internet seems to be full of horrible insanity no matter which way you turn. I feel more alone than ever and at the same time, like I'm being watched and scrutinised, whatever I do.

I could go on, these are all things that have weighed on individually before, but not like this. 

My very basic self diagnosis is that this is a combination of information overload, complete erosion of my sense of self, and the state of the world in 2020 finally catching up to me. I intend to to take a long break from the internet and social media because I can’t see any other way out, but I just need someone to hear me, lend any kind of support empathy or understanding, or advice about how to get out of this mess.

I have a loving family and partner and a pretty solid group of friends, but I feel so disassociated at the moment that I just needed to try and put it down in writing and shoot it out into the anonymity of the internet. I feel like I’m really losing the plot. I want to have hope again, because right now I’d rather just end it.",02Nov2020,1
92,"I remember when I was 5, I really disliked my mom. Like, unnaturally disliked. It's like I viewed my sister as my surrogate mother; I remember once crying when I was away from her. Maybe my older brother taught me, since he really hated my mom for having taken our family to America when he was 10. As I grew older, I learned to love my mom, but somehow, the suspicion always lingered. I distrusted my older brother too, since he would always ridicule me for my interests and for acting like a kid (he was going through his angsty teen phase, compounded by being in a foreign country and our poor socioeconomic status as immigrants). And my older sister was hardly even there. I felt so alone as a child, I felt like a paranoid alien.

I feel bad for my younger self. I was always too uptight, I never got to act like a kid. One moment my mom gives me a lot of affection, another minute she's screaming at me. She now expects me to do things she never taught or instilled in me, like have a work ethic. Who was supposed to teach me that? I put on the veneer of being self-reliant, of doing things by myself, but I can't seem to get my emotions or that lingering feeling of alienation in order.

I threw a lot of tantrums when I was a kid. I couldn't control my emotions, I was a loose cannon. In hindsight, I feel like I did it all for attention. I'm the one to blame, I should've behaved myself back then. I guess all I wanted was the feeling that I was wanted somewhere, and having a meltdown always gave it to me. But I was wanted. It's not like my mom hates me or anything. So why don't I feel it? What's wrong with me? Am I innately broken?

I've always felt apart from the other kids. I always felt powerlessness blanketing me. I felt like I wanted some control over my life even as a little kid. But why? That's not how a kid should act, that's not normal child psychology. But that was me, too self-conscious to live, wanting to melt in the background, couldn't control my meltdowns, too emotionally unstable to cope... I locked away my emotions and wore a thin façade. I needed to help myself, I had no one in the world. I have no one in the world.

I just want to be blanketed by the warmth of someone. I just want someone to hug me and tell me it's all going to be alright. But it won't. I'm an adult, I'm 18, yet I feel like less and less of an adult and more like a stunted man-child. People said I was mature for my age, but maturity is relative. I always knew there was something wrong with me, I was too different from the other kids (even though I just wanted to be carefree) but I was too helpless to stop it. Now all I do is wallow, maybe try fixing myself, let the discontent wash over me, and start again. What's at the root?

I'm typing this on a screen. I've stared at a screen for the vast majority of my life. It's all been screens, my escape, a reality where I could be a million people and nobody at the same time. Somewhere in which I could disguise myself, so that I could be protected from judgment, from the rot inside my soul. I donned many personalities, so many masks that I hardly know who I am inside, who I could've been, if only I had been up to the task of being a human being. I'm not sure if I really am human. If you shatter glass into a million, billion pieces, when does it cease to be glass and merely become sand, or particles? That's where I am right now. 

I want to learn how to love. I want to learn responsibility. All of the human things, away from the surreality of this screen. I want something real. So why am I so distrustful, so hollow? Why don't I know who I am? Why do I have no identity, no purpose, nothing but my own fantasies that there could be a single person I could fully trust?

I wish I was normal. My childhood counselors always said that it was alright to be different. But there's the good different, and the bad different. I'm the bad different. I wish I could love, but it's like everyone else is prickly. I'm trapped in my shell and can only see glimpses of life from here",02Nov2020,1

94,"Hey guys,, it's a pretty long story so I'll try to stay short. As a kid, I only had one friend ever.. the rest of my classmates ignored me and some of them were fake friends, my friend left in 5th grade I was lonely for the rest of my days at school ALWAYS. So at 11 I started making online friends behind my parents backs, taking pics of my face, skyping them etc. Those online kids told me I should kill myself s\*\*ually harassed me and threatened to come to my town and attack me. I was terrified for endless days, crying under my blanket, never told any of my family or only friend. I gave them chances to see if they could be better friends. They never did, I took revenge and spread some rumors to release my pain, and said sorry in the end, THEY NEVER DID! so I left them

   At 13, I found other friends. This time they were nice, and I was too. Until my close friend took offense of my silly jokes. I told them their drawings reminded me of my toys (because they were both drawings about superheroes, I wasn't saying their drawings look simple as toys) They were offended by something as silly as that! I accidentally swore at their friends and at them one time. I explained my mistakes were because I was a teenager and that I'm bad at talking to people because I don't have many friends!! Until one day after years of deep friendship, a lot of gifts given to them and a lot of jokes shared, they decided to leave me!! Because I lied behind their back to make a heartbroken girl feel better (she's heartbroken from my close friend) We were talking in secret about their weaknesses their unfair words! The girl said that my close friend made fun of her disease. So i had to do it to fix the relationship. I felt guilty after the secret conversation so (like an idiot) I decided to risk it and tell the truth because they are a friend! But they don't like honesty! and definitely not stupid mistakes or jokes :( so they blocked me and left me for life, even though they forgave me for about 5 times. I got better and tried my best. 

  When they did it, I started shaking from fear and crying to the point that my face aches from puckering too much. I promised myself not to use social media again to connect with people, unless it's a necessity (like here) Every time i try to type something to anyone I think too hard about my words and get scared if it'll hurt someone's feelings and sometimes I end up doing it without knowing why it's hurtful (I'm an honest person and i don't mind it if someone swore at me) So one time someone was offering to help me and i said ""You're not always available!"" and that hurt them,, no offence but people are so sensitive these days!!! I don't find that hurtful at all. in addition, I wanted to address a fictional character's height by saying their shortness is cute, but i didn't wanna hurt the author!! It ends up they weren't. I don't wanna sound rude but my close friend made me think that everyone on earth could potentially be like them! and that's why my brain thinks that everyone sucks!! (including me) and that everyone is  a crybaby! This isn't fair I wanna do social media but I don't think I can anymore. Why? Because of Trauma.

 *I'd rather feel nothing at all*  
*Than have to deal with all the pain inside my heart*  
*When she died I swore I'd never love again*  
*And it's been years, but I'm still calloused up like this* \-Nathan Wagner, Trauma.

95,"I went to haunted house. It was nothing special at first. I’m not saying I’m not scared or it was boring, they did a good work. The monsters look real, the actors work there putting up effort. I love and appreciate it.

Towards the end, there is this actor all tied up, her legs cut off, and she was crying, looking at me, hoping I’ll help. Of course I know she was acting but she was pretty convincing. I’m excited. To me she was the most beautiful aspect in this haunted house. 

I stare at her, I wanted to touch her but I know it’s not allowed. I even looked back when we past her. I looked and move on for like two or three steps before I saw a tall figure. I thought he was a guest. I lost focus. For a minute we just stand at each other, my mind is still on her. It hits me when he signal me it’s time to get out. Then I know he was one of the actor with chainsaw. Maybe he played as the killer. 

On my way back I began to think. Why is the only thing that excite me was the victim? Nothing more. I love rape hentai, porn, and I stopped liking the part where the girl gave in. I want the girl to fight, scream, be hopeless. Somehow it’s always girl I want to suffer. 

But I can’t stand animal being abused by human. I love the primal aspect where a carnivore eats their prey. To me, death or dying is beautiful.

96,"Hi everyone,

For many people, change isnt easy. Change especially is difficult when it involves a large life-style change. Graduating university, and the change in lifestyle that resulted was one of the hardest things I had to ever experience, I got OCD (scrupolosity), GAD levels through the roof, and depression during the period I graduated until now (four years ago until now)

&amp;#x200B;

**I lived through episodes of SEVERE trauma in my childhood. I hated highschool, but i looked forward for a fresh start in univeristy. I got into an esteemed University which meant that for ONCE, i was a success.** **University was that ""free"" space for me; where I could be ME and no one could judge me. S**ociety is nice to college students; they get to be big kids basically. Now? Now im a 28 year old who is working full time... im someone who feels like the eyes of the world is on him. **Why dont I have my own family yet? Why aren't I making enough money? Why am I not a child any more? (I say this as my hairline continues to recede.)**

I'll be honest, i kinda knew those four years would be amazing for me, so I honestly did brush off alot of things. Unfortunately, brushing off things is never good for your mental health.

Its been four years since I graduated. I've experienced the worst mental health crises of my life. I just want to feel free and fully happy again. Maybe Ill get there again. Maybe I had to have had this period, to express and release my **trauma.**

97,"Hello guys!

So, I had been a fairly skinny person almost all my life due to my fast metabolism. I'm an undergrad now and have gained weight ever since I left highschool. I wasn't studying what I like, putting off stuff for tommorow and was going through a rough patch emotionally. As a result, I started over-eating and gained weight. 

I realised my problem soon and changed my diet, lifestyle and habits. I lost weight but I'm not as skinny as I used to be before. But I love my body this way, it looks healthier and better. I'm neither over-weight nor under-weight.

I met some of my cousins few days back, they're super skinny. And you must have anticipated what happens next. They started shaming my body because I'm not as skinny as them. I have a cousin who's just two days younger than me, so we have a pretty good bond. But lately, my family members have started comparing me with her as she's quite thin. 

It bothers me alot, when people inadvertently compare and comment on my body. I absolutely adore my curves, my body looks healthier and more alive than it was before. But this ideology, that being skinny is being pretty, has been ingrained so deep in our society that sometimes I feel that even having normal weight is considered substandard.",02Nov2020,1

99,"So, the title pretty much says it all. I start feeling extremely nauseous around new people, or at the thought of meeting new people especially if they are women I'm attracted to. It kind of makes it difficult to meet people or form any meaningful relationship and I'm starting to feel really lonely. I've been single for almost 11 years(I'm 28) and the last girl I was with we didn't have a very long or serious relationship, but it was still fun. My mom died about 4 years ago of brain cancer and she was the person I would talk to about my problems like this. Now I'm either too embarrassed or I don't want to bother my friends or family with my problems. Been to a couple therapists and it didn't really help. It sort of seemed like they didn't take my issue that seriously. I guess it isn't: I'm not suicidal or depressed - just lonely and I think it's pretty normal to want to find a SO at my age. 

Is this normal? None of my friends seem to have this issue. Also it gets awkward when my friends or dad asks why I don't have a girlfriend. I said I wasn't interested, and they just stopped asking after a while. Pretty sure they think I'm either gay or weird, but honestly I'm just tired and embarrassed of trying to explain it to people and it gets me nowhere anyways.

I have done tons of different jobs in the last years since 16 ( drop out ).
Therapist confused doesn’t think I should work anymore system doesn’t want to put me on support.

I have notice how I look forward to sleep more and more, how I care less about my hygiene because I care less about going outside my house and how I paralyze when anything in my life gets difficult.

104,"So, I (18M) watched a video about a dude who cut off his lymph nodes and developed some sort of severe terminal brain injury that lead to his death around 2 years ago. Fast forward to today, and I'd honestly say many people who know me have seen my personality change for the worse in terms of anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

Things like cannabis, alcohol, and other brain stimulants were never really a fear of mine during middle school and earlier on in my life. At the time, I just didn't think much of them, I thought they were cool, and maybe I'd one day try them. Entering high school I'd developed a fear of that kind of stuff, the concept that I'm not in a perfect mind-state and that I'm stunting the development of my brain sent shivers down my spine. Not to mention the environment becoming more stressful, and my ability to draw the attention of my peers and lead a successful social life had diminished. Nonetheless, I did smoke weed and ate edibles back in grade 10, I remember feeling as though I was trapped in my own head, and as though the feelings I was experiencing were unreal, the first few trips I had were honestly pretty pleasurable. I've always had a racing mind that was always overthinking about things, but for once, it just felt like me and my head thinking odd thoughts. That was all okay until I had my first bad trip. This was after I had seen concerning information about brain health and other things, as well as the fact my vision had worsened a bit and my concentration also suffered some. This trip was as if all my fears had manifested into my personality. I was saying crazy things like, ""I can't feel my tongue!"" Or feeling my heart beating out of my chest... But on my right side... and it wasn't even beating hard. Since then, I've slowly felt as though I've disconnected from reality. I had a panic attack about 2 years ago, and at the time I thought nothing of it, until they happened more often. Admittedly, working out and getting sunlight helped a lot with dealing with my anxiety, but with the upcoming season and quarantine on top of having no school, my mind can't help but think of scary thoughts all the time. It's gotten so bad that whenever I see a mental disorder or any condition, I'll worry about getting it myself. I can't even get good sleep because feeling my heartbeat scares me. Even though I have a very healthy heart. Asides from the fact people around me know I'm more anxious, I'd like to think they all believe I'm a pretty loving and caring person, and I do really love my family and friends, but this anxiousness is debilitating. I want to feel IN THE MOMENT for my family's future life events, but I always feel like I'm in my own head overthinking things.

116,"I’ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for most of my life. I never felt that I could really tell anyone so I turned to cutting when I was twelve. I had a lot of friends in high school but never felt like I could tell them about how much I was really struggling. Credit where credit is due, looking back now some of them did try to reach out to support me but I did my very best to push everyone away. I only confided in an internet friend who I befriended and who I could still retain some degree of anonymity and be confident she wouldn’t be able to reach anyone I knew in real life. She helped me through some of the darkest periods of my life and had talked me out of ending my life on more than one occasion. Eventually, I knew that I had to stop cutting. I struggled with relapsing but eventually got to a point where I didn’t even think about cutting most of the time. That was almost three years ago now. I was recently diagnosed with a chronic illness and on top of dealing with abuse and my chronic illness. I cracked and cut myself for the first time in three years. I hate myself so much for this and I just don’t know who to go to anymore. I’m terrified of telling anyone because I don’t want to put more strain on my family. I can’t tell anyone but I don’t know how to stop.",02Nov2020,1

I literally have no one to talk to and I'm honestly used to it but every one in a while I see people texting and calling friends, family and loved ones and they have an actual conversation and laugh and smile. When I am texting  of calling my family its a simple how are you oh okay and a small update on what they are doing. It makes me sad that I can have what other people do have. When I'm out in public I think some creep is staring at me and I have no clue why or I hear people laugh and assume oh no I got my period and there is a stain or something is wrong with what I am wearing and they are making fun of me. I do not like the way I look either I never have but my image has been worse since I gained weight everyone tells me I have and that since I'm young still I should try to lose it.

I brought the fact that my parents are kind of abusive to me to my sister and being that she was able to move out before I was she told me I was being ungrateful because my parents didn’t have to keep me there as long as they did. Even after telling her stories of where they were being kind of abusive she still said I was ungrateful. She’s honestly the favorite in the family and my parents hold her on a pedestal so for her she sees a different image of them.

132,"So ive never mentioned any of this to anyone and this is gonna be really messy because i find it impossible to focus on stuff like this and proof read but like for the longest time ive had just idk weird shit like from when i was super young i used to have like this sight in my head sortve of like a snowball rolling down a hill towards me and getting bigger and i would also hear like voices that are angrily shouting but very quietly if that makes sense and sound and especially peoples voices around me would sound aggressive and loud to me and this always bought on really bad anxiety as it happened. I dont know when this first started happening but it was when i was super young around like 8 or maybe younger. I think this went away i dont really remember but then in secondary school i would have these same episodes sometimes randomly but usually in class and some classes more specifically than others like in my math class in year 9 maybe it was almost every day and i think it was more common in this class because the teacher made us stay dead silent. I also had id say minor depression during this time but while i was really young and id say that first started when i was 12. Id just breakdown in my room all the time and any argument with my mother or any thing id think about killing myself and climbing up to my roof and jumping and wondering if it would kill me or not. In secondary school i also had really severe ibs and had bad anxiety over this and got picked on for it, i also got picked on for my weight and felt bad about it but my school was a really toxic place and i was mean for no reason to alot of people too. I eventually went to the hospital about my ibs and i just lied to the psychiatrist or whatever its called because i didnt want to say i got bullied or felt bad and have to deal with all that. Anyway ive basically distracted myself my entire life with video games, about  8 months ago i met a girl online who im dating now online for 6 months and we are yet to meet, this is the first girlfriend ive ever had and shes sortve just made me aware that im not living my life, not just that im not doing anything productive with it i just literally feel like im watching myself. Im not sure how long ive felt like this, but my depression has been at its worst recently and i started self harming. Ive stopped now but like im completely 100% emotionally reliant on this person. In the first few months they defiantly made my mental health alot worse but this person also struggles with alot of issues from her past and has bpd, we're more settled now and im very grateful to have her and i think shes saved my life. But like any time we argue i just get like the worst depression of my life and if we like split up for a few days over and argument i contemplate suicide alot. Im not really scared of death anymore i went through school thinking  i was dying over a bunch of health problems i had and genuinely  didnt think id make it to  18 where i am now like i thought i had cancer or something. Anyway i dont know how much of this ive mentioned yet but i just like i feel like im not living in my own body and like im just living passively sortve i cant even focus on my computer screen anymore and that was like the only distraction ive had all my life all i do is just sit in my own head i dont even know if im thinking or not or just listen to music really loud and drown everything out. I have very few memories of my life for some reason i dont know why, ive always thought to myself theres no way the inside of everyones head feels like mine. I dont know what to do i really do not even care that much id be happy to not wake up tomorrow, i dont have the energy or emotional capacity  to tell anyone. Saying that i also feel emotionless alot like the only thing i really feel is emptiness when i feel really depressed or just  a feeling that i wanna escape for some reason. I try to make myself cry sometimes to try relieve this but i cant even do that. Like i have no idea what ive included in this post my eyes are focused on the screen but im not taking it in if i try to read it i just forget instantly. I also forgot to mention that super recently, after 'breaking up' with my girlfriend that these quiet shouting voices started again for the first time in years but they didnt stay for long, that was maybe a month ago. Im really happy with my partner and shes literally all i live for, even though ive never met her in person which will probably sound really stupid to alot of people. But like not only do i not feel like talking to anyone but i have nobody to talk to, i cant talk to my girlfriend because she has way to many problems of her own and talking to her just makes  it worse for her, i could keep going on but nobody will read this if i do so ill just stop, thankyou if you made it this far, i dont know if i even feel like this all the time i literally have no idea how i feel and its kinda scary maybe i feel normal sometimes and i just dont realize when i feel like this but thanks again for reading",02Nov2020,1

145,"So, to start with i suffer from borderline personality disorder. A majority of you will understand that diagnosis,  for others who don't, here are a few bits and pieces that come with that
O. Depression
O. Anxiety
O. Paranoid thoughts
O. Destructive and irrational behaviour 
O. Emotional extremes 

Lately, during this pandemic, my relationships have been a bit up and down, I'm not talking in romantic sense, but friends, family, ect. Most of my friends are now online, all from my country. 
Recently I found myself drawn to someone a little less local, theyre funny, smart, we have debates, share memes and its been great. I found myself smiling whenever I'd  see their little ID  that says online. 
But more often then not whenever I jump on, they seem to jump off. I've tried to be rational, and ask if I've done something wrong  they explained not at all, and continued to post memes ect at times that im not online.  I know life can get busy, or at least that's what I keep trying to tell myself, maybe they don't want to talk right now, maybe they're struggling with their mental health too. 
Now these particular feelings, the bad ones, what if I'm annoying them, maybe they actually don't like me, what if they're just being nice ect, are all emotions I feel most of the time. That just comes with BPD and many other disorders, and usually if my friends live near me, I catch up and can read their faces, their voices, and get it through my head that everything's okay, but in this time its not as easy, and I feel like I annoy my friends more if I ask for reassurance.  My mental health isn't their responsibility. The way i feel is on me, and its hard  
So I guess my question is, how do you stop yourself from getting these negative feelings, or make them hurt less? Im not on meds or i don't see a therapist, mainly because I have techniques for certain aspects of my mental health, but this one here is a problem, because im not my friends...I have no idea what they're feeling, its out of my control and im not great with things I can't control.",02Nov2020,1

155,"For the last few years I have been feeling an increasing sense of apathy and it has gotten to the point where I don't find anything I used to do interesting anymore, instead it feels like I am just doing things to pass the time and not because I want to do it. 

An example of this is gaming, I used to play video games a lot (for more than 8 hours a day sometimes) and now, I can't even stick with a game for more than an hour before getting bored. I can't even focus on a tv show/movie without mindlessly browsing my phone.

It seems like I have no sense of motivation or ambition to do anything, whether this be to entertain myself or improve anything in my life (such as physical health).

The main times I do seem to care about things anymore, it seems obsessive. For example, I have a need to check door locks a very large amount of times. I will lock the front door to my house, and then stand there for around 2-3 minutes constantly trying to open the door even though I know I've already locked it, but it is as if I am trying to give myself enough evidence that this is actually the case. (I will also do this with bathroom door locks etc.) This causes issues, as after the few minutes of trying, it isn't necessarily over, I will walk 10+ minutes to work and then just feel a drive that I need to go and check the lock again, this causes me to walk all the way back, unlock and relock the door and repeat the process.

Another example, is constantly thinking how other people view me and being unable to speak in some situations. An example of this is at work, I will try to impress the higher ups by doing different things but then I am completely unable to have an actual conversation, I just get extremely quiet and want to speak but can't. The worst this gets is with phone calls, I once had a panic attack that caused me to shake uncontrollably after being on the phone and I had to walk out of the office and get water to calm myself down. (I am also shaking a small bit just writing this out.

156,I was diagnosed with depression a little over 2 years ago but I never got help because my parents were convinced I could pray it away and that it was just demons. Fast forward 2 years and I don’t think I’ll ever recover. I’m at a point where I feel little to no emotion and the emotion I do feel is immense anger and sadness. My heart physically hurts constantly because I’m so stressed. I’m always the person telling everyone else that things will be okay and there’s hope but I don’t even believe that myself. I can barely eat anything anymore without feeling sick. I sleep for more than half the day. Taking a shower or even brushing my teeth is a chore. I haven’t offed myself yet because I just feel guilty. But I always imagine how good it would feel to end it all.

164,"I literally can't trust anyone in real life to handle this information, not even my friends.

So basically, my life has been going downhill for about 3 years ago till now.

My primary school score is literally 218/300, despite getting 3 As and 1 B. I thought I could try harder in secondary school and I put as much effort as I could.

But all my efforts went unnoticed since my grades were still so low. No one cares how much effort you put into the things you do anymore. The final score is all that really matters and with my final score not being much, every returned test was just another scolding from my parents, saying I didn't check my paper after doing it or that I didn't even try.

So I tried to put some effort into my other things, like my hobbies, or what made me happy.
No one cares about those either.
No one cares if you like video editing , it's pathetic, theres no future.
No one cares if you enjoy drawing, it's pathetic there's no future.
No one cares if you do anything that isn't your studies, it's pathetic,theres is no future in that either.

My happiness literally drops so quickly, and school life isn't jolly either.
My classmates are literal children. The way they talk, the way they act, so happy like nothing will ever affect them.
These children do so much better than me in grades that I hate myself for doing worse than a bunch of pathetic people who I know dislike me.


I have this odd thing where I just randomly get sleepy and I don't know why. The heat? Am I sick? There is no reason for it, and I'm getting scolded for it by my parents for it happening during my tution lessons.


I'm always getting scolded for things that have nothing to do with me. Even if it's not me getting scolded, I get the worst burn marks from my parent's anger. I get scolded for things I didn't even know why happen, but because it obviously has to be my own fault, I'm scolded for things I have no answer for. 

They say I'm lazy, I never use any effort, I'm pathetic and I have no future, and that they've wasted so much money on me I'm just burning.

Worst part? All of it is true. I am just some lazy dumb person who can't do better than his childish classmates. I'm the person who feels a pinch when I ask for help, which is why I never do.

I would have killed have killed myself so much earlier if I didn't have a fear of pain.
I no longer want to kill myself, though still I wish I could.

My goal is to make all the people who never felt the pain I felt. They are the ones who made me feel pain, and I want to punch, maybe do something more, all of them in the face and make them know how much pain I felt.

I'm not going to die till everyone feels pain.",02Nov2020,1

166,"I want to share something that has been working for me. I know there are a lot of exercises out there, and this one isn't probably anything different than existing ones, but I felt like sharing because I have tried a lot of things that hasn't worked for me, and this one has helped.

When I am laying in bed and having dark thoughts, or even just useless ones that are keeping me up, making me feel worse, I have started just mentally repeating the phrase ""The Color Blue"". It's a pretty innocuous phrase - it both has meaning, but is also sort of meaningless, and yet it's complicated enough that it sort of blocks out any other persistent thoughts. 

I honestly don't know how I came up with this phrase. I guess blue is soothing and normally makes me  think about the sky or water. But I don't actually have any of those things pop into my head when repeating it. It's the words themselves seem to be the trick, and not so much the meaning, but the articulation of them and the weird rhythm of saying them.

I sort of use it as a mental flyswatter. I use it aggressively (not passively) to kick out the annoying thoughts in my head. Sometimes it's easier than other times. Sometimes I am practically mentally 'screaming' it, quickly and repeatedly. But the important thing for me, is that it's been working and I am actually getting the sleep I need.

176,"I am an 18-year-old boy from Spain doing online school with no friends living with my mom and her boyfriend who is sensitive and takes offence to things I do in a farmhouse. I used to live with my dad in Asia. I was about to start my last year of high school when I decided to move back to Spain. I was feeling lost and bored in Asia and wanted to start my life. My plan was to move back with my mom, finish highschool online and get a job or something.

A month after I arrived in Spain my mom's boyfriend got offended because I got frustrated when I was skateboarding. Apparently, for him, me getting frustrated was enough to end it all with my mom, which made me feel like shit because I don't want to hurt her. Anyways, 5 days go by without saying a word to him or him saying a word to me and we are back to being friends. One morning I wake up to my mom saying if I want to go on a road trip. I decided to go even though that it's really tough for me due to my crippling anxiety. The whole trip and day were good except for a couple of things which I didn't find as troubling but other people did.

I used to be a very happy smiley person that would be the life of the party but that changed after 5+ really bad years. I was diagnosed with bipolar and I had really bad anxiety. This sorta changed how I acted mainly due to the really strong medication that they were giving me. Nowadays it's way harder to relate with people and have a good time with other people and I often feel more comfortable alone even though I hate being by myself. During that road trip, I barely said much because I didn't have anything valuable to say and I had a resting bitch face which is now the new normal for me. During the trip my mom would say ""cmon smile or act happy he brought us here to have a good time, he is spending his time and money on skateboard parts"". I was happy and grateful for what he was doing I just wasn't showing it guess. I ended up getting mad with my mom because it really annoys me when people ask me if I'm ok when I am. I am not a victim or someone's puppy.

Anyways, this is where started going downhill. We were at a store and he made a joke and pretended to hit my balls and then he softly tapped/punched my arm, sorta like what you do with your friends. I decided to give him a pat on the arm back which is sorta what you do in those situations. Apparently, that was disrespectful and got told off by my mom. The thing that I don't get is that he tried to pinch my balls without me being fully ok with it, but a pat on the arm crosses the line. After that, he once more thought of leaving my mom. There were a couple more situations after that similar to these which occurred after my girlfriend broke up with me. After all of this, I was really fed up and affected by this to the point that I wanted to run away or just move away. I decided not to because that would be too painful for my mom instead I decided to just act differently around both my mom and her boyfriend. With my mom, I act just like how I was 5 years ago before all the bad stuff happened. With him I just act like a whole completely different person, I really watch out with what I say and do making me extremely stressed.

To conclude whatever this, I am right now at the point where I just want to disappear, I don't care about anyone, I don't know who I am it's like I've lost my personality, my soul. I don't want to keep living like this. I'm alone and slowly going crazy. All I want to do is do drugs because when I do I feel like myself again.

178,"When I was around 14 I started being invaded my paranoide thoughts. I felt in danger: I could feel people destroying my house's door and assassinating everyone. Also I felt someone wanted to kill me. At the same time, I was having quite strong phosphenes, to the point I couldn't sleep. I still remember them: they were really vivid and complex. Somehow I also felt a tinnitus and imagined sounds were also very lively. Well, the paranoia ended and I was never annoyed again with tinnitus nor did I ser phosphenes.

With 19, during covid-19 lockdown, I started hearing tinnitus again. Then phosphenes, felt that the world was unreal, got attacked by vile intrusive thoughts, despair, hopelessness. I would stare at the mirror I would feel that my face wasn't mine. I was in a kind of dream.

However, now I feel a lot better. I'm not suspended on that oniric state nor do I feel greatly annoyed by the latent tinnitus (it diminished but didn't dissapear).

I thought this could've been a drug induced psychosis but it wouldn't make much sense: it started about 2 months after the lockdown and I didn't use any drug as opposed to before the quarantine.

I inferred from this that strong phosphenes may equal to a chaotic brain. What's the opinion of yours?",02Nov2020,1

To give you some details, I had been talking about this dinner the whole day because I was pretty excited to go out in the middle of this pandemic and I changed and was all ready but as soon as I was about to sit in my car one really judgey and rude look from my mother was enough to make me start sobbing (this isn’t normal for me) and I ran back inside.

As context: 

1. Throwaway account because I feel like I can be more open.
2. I am not self-harming or suicidal
3. I am currently seeing a therapist but I'm wondering if there is more I can do.
4. I am looking for advice from people who have been in similar situations, what helped you to break the cycle, or lessen the impact, or get you out of a spiral, etc.

That being said, incoming wall of text:

I hate myself, and I don't know what to do. I told my husband yesterday that self-affirmations don't work for me because I feel like I have nothing to affirm. I am surrounded by friends who invite me to come over for dinner, who congratulate me on recent accomplishments, and try to celebrate me, and all I can see is that I am their pity friend who they just want to make sure doesn't off himself. I am going back to school for a career change because I am burning out in my current one (teaching high school) and working from home, so I am adding another stressor but to me I see this as worth it because I am going to decrease stress in the long-run.

I know what to do to help myself like working out, going outside more (to the park or just a walk), trying to find ways to ""stop working"" from home and just being home, but I can't seem to do it. I just don't care enough about myself to actually help myself. I really just see myself as someone who I hate and why would I want to help someone I hate this much? Yesterday when I told my husband all of this too I didn't say everything because I felt like I was being a burden and holding him back with my depression and didn't want him to catch any of it. Even when I went the the bathroom later I turned around to brush my teeth because I didn't want to change seeing myself in the mirror. 

I don't think I'll ever get to the point of suicide or self-harm, I have seen the impacts that has on others and I would check myself into the hospital before that. Right now though I feel like I am in the middle class of self-hate. I have and suffer from it, but not enough to go get serious help for it. Honestly, I think so little of myself I don't know if I want to put my insurance company (US) through paying for a mental health stay anyway. 

I don't know what to do, or how to break the cycle or how to start caring for myself or liking myself. I am tired of people telling me to do what, ""makes me happy"" because there isn't anything that does. I really can't tell you what I enjoy anymore, I think everything has just become an escape for me, and not in a healthy way.

195,"Hi reddit, I have been struggling with anxiety, depression, what I think is binge eating and restrictive eating. A little related story... My biological sister (we grew up in the same household as well) has been recently diagnosed with binge eating disorder. She also had been previously diagnosed with depression and anxiety. My biological brother was diagnosed with depression. My oldest, half-sister was diagnosed with depression several years ago.

I need help and am trouble finding affordable resources. My health insurance will not cover mental health care until my deductible is met and finances are tight. I want to get help but I can't invest money currently to do so. I have tried a few depression medications without much success. I am more interested in cognitive behavior therapy than medication. Any advice appreciated! Thank you!!",02Nov2020,1

I’m a college student, and recently, there’s been a high number of suicide and other mental health problems here. Our school has done nothing and resources here are limited.

I want to help them but I don’t know how. I’m currently setting up an online, anonymous peer support group through discord. We had 100+ people in the first day. They were venting, sharing, etc. 

However, it’s gone quiet since then and I think people forgot about it. I know people are still scared because they’re venting all over Reddit. I want to create something like a distress text line. I just don’t have the money and am only one person. I’ve been calling other organizations for support and help all of last week but no one has replied.

If anyone has experience or any idea of what I can do to support my peers, please let me know. This is a very personal issue for me, so I’m not going to give up on it. Thanks :)",02Nov2020,1

I always feel unmotivated, irritated, and have this urge to stuff myself with food.

201,"About me:

- I'm a 44 year old male in the USA (NJ). 
- I was diagnosed with ADD or ADHD in grade school more than 30 years ago. I've never seen a Dr. about my mental health out side of school. My ADD is pretty bad but I was able to graduate collage and get a good job.
- I had some pretty bad depressive episodes in high school and I guess I've always cycled up and down a little. It's never been manic to the point of losing touch with reality or depressive like I can't get out of bed. 
- The last few years I've started to become anxious more often.
- I drink heavily daily(I would assume more by most measures). I don't believe that I'm a traditional alcoholic. I abstain when I don't feel well. I drink only after work for a few hours (probably 6 or fewer drinks) and then have no trouble stopping, etc. 

- Over consumption of alcohol and ADD run in my family. I believe my sister has bipolar disorder or similar (she hasn't been diagnosed to my knowledge).

Very lately I get really moody with my wife. I get set off over trivial things she does and stay mad for days. We argue about it and I can see how she was right all along. It's embarrassing and I fear its going to damage or relationship beyond repair. This is definitely directly related to alcohol, if anything I'm more even when I'm drinking and I can't think of any arguments that have started about drinking or while drinking. Also maybe people would call it depression, I don't know. I feel just stuck in life, nothing seems to make me feel good, life feels hard, kids are a struggle, I feel unsuccessful etc. Most times we argue after this goes on for a while and then... suddenly I feel better at least for a little while.  

I guess I'm here to ask what should I do? I assume You'll tell me to speak to a Dr., where do I start with that? I'm well aware that I should stop or at least decrease my drinking. I have insurance. Do I just call any random psychiatrist I find locally? Do I go to my family doctor?",02Nov2020,1

206,"After 25 years of having a mentally I'll brother I'm just so sick of it.  He goes through phases but frequently blows up.  He blew up on my father a couple of months ago and I guess my father has decided to not answer his calls.   He asked me this weekend 'Why doesn't dad answer my calls?'.  I said I didn't know but likely he didn't like it when you blew up on him so maybe you should think about apologizing for that.   Anyhow - he immediately hung up, then flew into a rage about how dare I suggest he apologize.  Then he starts to throw in anything he can think up where he feels he has been unfairly treated.   

In the past I typically just ignore him for a week or so an he will eventually apologize but these episodes are getting so old.   He left 25 messages and a few nasty emails.  Here is a sampling - this is a very tame one.

https://s21.aconvert.com/convert/p3r68-cdx67/je512-fu3s5.m4a

He has done this to his mother, father, landlords, anytime he feels like he has been mistreated.  He then will proceed to call and tell the rest of the family how poorly he gets treated.    He is smart however so plays the victim card very well.  He likes to tell me how the rest of family can't believe what we do him (whatever that is).

He will feel better in a week or two and make amends promising to never do it again but alas..  here we are.   His mental health team recently dropped him as although he has mental Illness he is high functioning and more manipulative/angry then anything, he refused to get the help they kept suggesting to manage his anger.

Just to give you an idea of random things that set him off this past summer his roommate asked him to not talk so loud on his phone as he is a shift worker...  well this set him off and 15 minutes later he jumped his roommate in bed beating him and told him 'don't you ever f%^% tell me what to do"".    He got kicked out of that place..  but like all the other times it was them not him that caused it.

I refused to help him move as I just moved him in a few months earlier and then he blew up similarly to the message above... I was an idiot always taking other peoples sides and never listening to him etc...

Anyway - after 25 years of this its really starting to take its toll.  I really feel like just cutting off all ties with him.  He has literally also ended contact with the rest of the family..  I don't know what he tells them but they have never called to ask if we needed help supporting him..  in fact just the opposite has happened, we never hear from them.  According to him he tells them all the terrible things we've done to him.

When I gotten older it started to have it's own personality and even argued with me. I started to do research I didn't want to talk to anyone about it because I didn't want anyone think I am crazy. I couldn't find anything. I heard the term tulpa many times but I didn't believe it was a thing. But after doing research I realise that this indeed sounds familiar.

Epesodes lasted about 4-5min can be stopped by watching telly or talking to another human.
I would feel seprate from my body as if I'm watching myself do things. There would be a noise like chatter in my mind that was very loud but audiably silent.
The chatter came with a rising pressure as if it was getting louder and stronger the longer I leave it.
Trying to listen to the sound and pick out words(sounded like 100 people talking at once) I would find myself manipulating what words I would her, so I concluded I am not hearing voices just hearing my own internal monolog louder than the noise but only when focused on.

I was so busy, I didn't really have time for the reality of to sink in until this past week/weekend. My fiance (28M) is amazing and is always there for me in my mental health crisis', and even helps me take my antidepressant when I ""don't feel like it."" 

This weekend I started to fall into a depression over this. I spent 12 years of misdiagnoses, putting myself in horrible situations all related to this disorder. If I had known when I was 20, I wouldn't be where I am today. 

My fiance hates to see me spiral into depression, and with HPD it happens quite often. So in an attempt to try to lift my spirits he said -- I hate when people let their illness define them. 

While I understand where he's coming from, I don't think he understands the severity of a personality disorder. This stupid thing is the majority of who I am, or have been up til this point. I mean I have done horribly promiscuous things because of this personality disorder... Things I look back on and am wondering why or how that even occured. It took over my entire life.

211,"Not sure how to start.. but everything’s was a build up for many years. 

Not even sure what or how should I type so here’s some scatter thoughts and information.

I grew up in a broken family, raised by my mother.
She worked multiple jobs to support my brother and I. Our life are much better now as compared to the past.

I’ve taken up most of the cleaning in the household 90%? And feel being taken for granted, it’s making me feel like I’m obligated to do so and not being appreciated. (My friends call me Cinderella)

My mom rely a lot on me until the extend I feel like I’m being abused mentally. One recent incident - I was in the toilet, and my mum shout for me for some help from the kitchen. As I was taking a dump, I shouted for my brother who was resting in the room. And instead of having his help she rather wait for me. To her it was nothing, to me I feel like she didn’t want to disturb his rest. 

Side note I always feel like my mom is biased towards my brother. (Traditional Asian mentally which boys are being favoured more than girls). I told her how I feel during one of our huge argument/my mental breakdown and she said she’s not. But here’s one of many other incident why I felt this way - I stay with my mom, my brother comes home randomly and on the weekends. On days that he coming home my mom will cook a lot of dishes, prawns fish meat etc. But on normal days just the both of us she would usually cook simple and less dish. And whenever he’s home she would always ask if she need to scoop his rice, has he eaten, is he tired etc blablabla. But whenever she came home her first few sentences to me “why didn’t you clean this, why didn’t you clean that. Bla blabla along this line.” Never have I eaten am I tired.

Also whenever I tried to talk to her be it in whatever methods - calmly, crying, argument, shouting and screaming. She always blame it back on me. There’s always smth to blame it on me and nothing is ever her fault/problem. 

Anw to cut things short, I feel very drain by my mom, mentally abused, tired of this life (not suicidal), want to escape from her but feel guilty about it as she’s growing old each day, not in good health. Random days I’ll just cry and get over it and life goes on.

So what am I? Am I suffering from depression? Or mental illness? I don’t feel like I am but I do cry by myself whenever I can’t take it anymore. And of course whatever I said above are just the tip of the iceberg but i am really really really very tired of this shit. 

Ps/ I still love her a lot.",02Nov2020,1
212,"I hope you had an amazing weekend!

Yesterday, I structured my notes so that I could chart my mood throughout the day. 

I did a subjective scale first but then converted to the Fieve-Dunner Manic Depressive Mood Scale (DSM). They will often use this when checking patients for bipolar. 

What I found interesting is that I was having a great day so I subjectively rated it in the range of 8. However, according to the DSM, 8 is extreme elation meaning I could be manic, psychotic or delusional.

Depending on who you are, you don't actually want to be too low or too high. A 60 is a mildly elevated mood and is a good place to be. 

As the Buddhist say, aim for the ""Middle Way"".

I've attached:

1. [Subjective &amp; DSM ratings by hour](https://tylerbryden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fieve-Dunner-Manic-Depressive-Mood-Scale-Rating.png)
2. [The scale and definitions from the DSM](https://tylerbryden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fieve-Dunner-Manic-Depressive-Mood-Scale.png)
3. [The number of words typed by hour](https://tylerbryden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Number-of-Words.png)

Using this scale now gives me better insights into the unstructured writing I did throughout the day.

For me right now is this the scale I should be using? I don't know if I'm considered a ""Healthy Normal"" now in my life or not you know?

How are you tracking mood? Do you have any ideas on better ways to track and format this? What tools do you find best for this process?

But god damn if I’m not tired of being fucking gas lighted and projected onto. Is it because I am firm in my awareness of my mental health and open that people feel the need to project and gaslight? I really don’t understand it.

228,"Hey everyone!

How are we all doing today?

Thanks to the lovely people of the NHS, they kindly make a list of ways to look after your Mental Health while In Lockdown during this worldwide pandemic. I believe I have posted about this before, but just to remind people and the brand new members of the r/mentalhealth. A big welcome to you! Understandably, people’s Mental Health are being struck incredibly hard during the pandemic. This sub, as it has done everyday for the past few months has been incredibly supportive, helpful and giving out advice left, right and centre for people who need is the most. So, due to that, I thank you for that. Down below are some tips from the NHS on how to look after your Mental Health during these difficult times:

- Check your employment and benefits rights 
- Stay connected with others - family and friends. 
- Get your worries out in the open. It is much better to get it out of your system, rather than keep it inside of you. 
- Look after your body. It’s not always open your Mental strength, but physical too. If you’re able to, get out there and do some exercise!
- Don’t stay glued to the news. These days, watching the news or reading the newspaper can be a depressing thought. Unfortunately, that’s all you see is negative news, one after another. Instead, watch a comedy film or read a nice novel!
- Don’t let the pandemic take control of your life and put it on stall. Continue to do the things you enjoy doing the most. Go and play some sport, video games, listen to music, watch some movies and much more!

I don't what I'm looking for to help me but there has to be something. It's insane. I'm so desperate for a way out of this but I can't do the one thing that could possibly make things better. I don't want to self diagnose, but I've been feeling all the symptoms of anxiety and depression for years and I'm so tired. It's ruining my life. I can't make friends because anytime I have to go anywhere I have a panic attack, which drains me almost everyday. I cheat my way through middle school because everything I read just goes right through my head. Everything I used to love feels like a chore. I'm too stressed to stay awake but too scared to go to sleep, afraid of what nightmares will wake me up in a cold sweat in the morning. I haven't been hungry in months. All my muscles feel weak and exhausted. I keep zoning out into weird vivid day dreams that I can't snap out of. All of a sudden I'm having these weird thoughts that are things like ""if you don't put on this pair of socks something bad will happen"" I don't know if that's just my imagination or something I should add to the list of things that are wrong with my brain. And I'm so easily irritated and I can't control when I lash out at my family. That's even worse than being sad all the time because I'm making them upset too. Everyone would just be better off with out me. It just feels like a constant downward spiral that's I'll never escape. I don't even look like myself anymore. And no one knows but a few strangers on the internet, even though I'm surrounded by people that love and care for me. Why does it feel like I'm all alone?",02Nov2020,1
231,"I have most of the symptoms of bipolar disorder. Maniac episodes, though not really common. These episodes just make me do things I wouldn't normally do. These I do aren't very harmful, and can even make me more outgoing, as I  tend to be very introverted. More commonly however are depressive episodes, and sometimes its gets so bad that I start have suicidal thoughts. Usually these episodes only last for a few hours at most but it definitely has lasted for a couple days. However, I usually feel pretty normal and I try to not to let these affect me.  I also have mood swings, loss of interest in things I know I enjoyed, and more. 

One thing that is preventing me from seeking out a professional diagnosis, is that I am a teenager. I know it is hard to get a bipolar diagnosis as a teen as it could just be mood swings. Is this bipolar, something else, or just hormornal mood swings?",02Nov2020,1

233,"I know the title shouts 'bad idea' but please at least listen to my reasoning.

I'm currently on 600mg of seroquel and 150mg of wellbutrin. 

Currently diagnosed with chronic insomnia, depression, PTSD, some anger issues, and ADHD. I have some paranoia issues, but I haven't received any diagnosis for it. I also have agoraphobia, although I haven't received a formal diagnosis either. 

I'm female, 17, 5'8, and currently weigh 245 lbs. My weight is a very big issue for my mental health, and I've struggled a lot to get it down. It took me a year to get to 245lbs from 263lbs. I eat about 1 meal a day and have been limiting my sugar intake. 

My weight makes it harder for me to do the things I love, like take walks, go bike riding, dance, and honestly just take care of myself. I have asthma on top of it (something I had before the weight) and it's very difficult to even just shower. It hurts to breathe. 

I wondered why I was still so heavy even after changing up my whole eating style. I then found many, many articles talking about how seroquel can cause significant weight gain. I seriously felt crushed. The one thing that was suppose to be helping me is causing one of my biggest issues. 

The seroquel has helped me sleep and stay calm, and I'm happy about that. I'm definitely more erratic when I'm off it, but again, it's causing one of my most serious issues.

I've been on it for about 2 and a half years, with no real change in doses. 

I've changed a lot as a person, and have stopped self harming for about a year, so for a whole year the seroquel just made me sleep. I don't think it was what helped me stop self harming. 

I'm just so angry rn honestly (no, I haven't stopped taking them yet). I was not told of any of the side effects, hell I wasn't even told it was an antipsychotic. I thought it was an antidepressant (which none of the ones I've been on have done any sort of good...) Although I'm young, I want to know exactly what I'm putting in my body. I ask questions, but it really feels like they are annoyed every time. 

My brother eats the same as me, hell probably even worse and is still thin. I'm the only chubby sibling and it's extremely obvious. I hate my body and feel like garbage all the time. It feels like every time I take the seroquel I'm hungry.

I'm basically addicted to seroquel by now (I have extreme withdrawal symptoms, and literally cannot eat because I throw everything up.) I'm not planning on going cold turkey, as I know how awful my withdrawal gets. I plan to slowly lower the dosage of the seroquel (not the wellbutrin, it doesn't have anything bad side effects from it) 

Overall, I'm still debating. I would like an outside opinion so I know it's not just my feelings getting to me.",02Nov2020,1

I don’t know if I’m overly anxious. What is normal? Some days I have numb days, like today, when nothing can keep you from feeling so empty. How far do you have to stay to be mental incompetent; to have previously been sent to an asylum. What does it take to be called insane? How many itches, bruises, scratches. How can they see the ones inside too? They wouldn’t take a lie detector into a hospital, would they? No. They wouldn’t. They’d employ someone to say the worse, to rinse out all hope. For the parents to be given the worse news: we can help her. Now our systems have advanced, you, the parent, who most likely could’ve saved a lot of your own child’s innocence if the equipment we have now was around then. The diagnosis might have helped, or hindered your life. The label could have turned sour, into a scar, or it could be something to be proud of. How do we know how someone else would react?

I'm 21 and as far as I know I'v been depressed for a good chunk of my life, I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 14 and anxiety is also in the mix. When I was 13 my father got full custody of me and i was made to leave my mom and live with him. When I was with him i always had extreme difficulty communicating, it happens when something is brought up it can be a little issue and I will cry uncomfortably. It doesn't matter how much I prepare myself it always happens and its frustrating and it makes me feel angry and ashamed, embarrassed too. My mind goes crazy I can't really get anything out how I need. My mind is racing all the time I feel like as soon as I get my words and let them out they aren't the same thing that I thought of. This happened so much when I was with my father I'd get into trouble and when they'd confront me sit me down or whatever  the same thing would happen freeze up and not be able to get anything out or if I was able to get anything out it wouldn't make sense. 
Half of the time I'm depressed and little go away I'll have my okay time and it will hit again. I've been in a relationship for 2 year now we have a beautiful son together and I'm expecting my 2nd child with him right now, my struggle with communication is straining things in our relationship. I just need answers it's so expensive for mental health care and we are barely making ends meet. 
Not until recently I was trying to think back to my childhood and there are parts I don't remember. I've considered a lot of things for my mental issues, like bipolar disorder or bipolar depression. 
When I was little probably like 7 or 8 I think it's hard to remember but I was riding my bike one day, I had learned without training wheels like some months prior I think. Well today i was riding and we lived down a kinda gravel road and I'd go to the last house and back but that day the lady at the end of the street was out with her dog. Idk if she let it out on purpose or what but that little rat came bolting for me on my bike ran in front of me after I had turned around and picked up speed I hit it but it stopped me and flipped my bike I landed on my head and I don't really remember what happened after that I just remember there was blood dripping down my face and I had an indentation in my skull for a long time and is still partially there now. 
I was doing reading sometime at the beginning of the year about serial killers and head trauma and It dawned on me that what If I did really get messed up when I fell and now it's the reason behind my mental illnesses and my difficulties communicating. I didn't go to the hospital after that I can remember.

For some people even getting out of their bed is a struggle. I, for example, try to set a new routine and almost instantly the routine failed.

I sometimes get so frustrated with my life it makes me just want to hit my head against a wall. But instead I cut myself because it’s quieter. I feel so overwhelmed all the time and I feel like i’m truly never all there. I am scared to go driving sometimes because I’ve almost gotten into crashes simply because I zone off. My lack of attention has made me struggles severely
in school. I simply can’t keep focused. Last night I woke up at 4am and I went to go grab a drink of water. My entire body felt foreign and numb and as I looked around I had a strong sense of unfamiliarity. I made my way back to my bedroom. I am incredibly tired, but it felt like my head was yelling at me and my thoughts were so loud and they couldn’t go away and it didn’t let me sleep. If i’m being completely honest I’m not suicidal. I wish I had easy means of killing myself because the thought of going to sleep forever sounds like heaven, but I can’t do that. I have 2 sisters who I love and I want to be here for because I know my parents are emotionally unavailable. I’ve begged them for help, to take me to a therapist. They refuse. I told them how I feel and they’re telling me it’s just puberty and my hormones and that they felt this way too. I overthink everything, I can turn an innocent conversation with a friend, to something they’re plotting behind my back. I get mood swings everyday but I bottle them up and very rarely do I have outbursts, but I can go for motivated and excited one second to nihilistic and depressed the next with no real cause, I know this sounds like i’m bipolar but i’ve been like this my entire life, and i’m not sure if being bipolar is developed or inherited. I believe my mother struggles with mental illness as well. She would tell me stories about how when she was younger she’d see a little ball floating in the air, and it would move closer to her and get bigger and bigger. And that my grandma took her to the hospital and the doctors told her it’s because she’s not studying hard enough. And that it’s the fear of being unaccomplished.

It feels like you are trapped. Like You are being crumpled into a ball and thrown around a room. It feel like chains are holding you to a hot iron. You can’t escape. You try, but every time it fails. You feel alone. You feel like there is no one there and you tell yourself, “I want to go home.” More often than not you are telling yourself that at your home. But you want to go home, to serenity, to peace, and to be free from these chains. It feels like you climbing a ladder and before you can reach the top someone takes a knife and cuts off your fingers. You try to fight back every time, but you can’t. You just want to go “home”. You bleed, and while bleeding you hold yourself high, trying to stop yourself from breaking down and vomiting blood. You cry, you cry waterfalls. You want to get on with your day but you are scared something will kill you. You can’t move. You begin to scream-yet you don’t. Your mouth opens wide and you scream so loud only your mind hears it. You begin to realise you are losing a battle. That a dark force inside your brain is taking over you and your armies, your heart, you, are trying to fight back but it fights you and kicks you to the ground. You try to get up when you hit the ground but you can’t. You tell yourself you are going to be ok, something inside your head agrees yet the dark force sends another horde and defeats you. You begin to hang on threads, making steps and efforts to save yourself. You don’t know if you will live today or live tomorrow. You start to die inside. Your heart, once red and bright dims to pitch black. You begin to have tears, hot sizzling tears drip from your eyes. You take hours in the shower because you are horrified to get out. You try to fight the dark force but you cannot. For the dark force has chained you, and you can’t break free. Each day the force grows stronger sending another arrow, another bullet through your head. Your arms, your legs, your mouth dies. You feel dead. Yet you aren’t. You tell yourself, “is it worthwhile to live when I might die.” and you think you are losing a battle, and you can’t fight back. You want to surrender. You want this to end. But you don’t know how and you resort to thoughts so morbid they scare you. Just as you are about to take the weapon to put yourself to rest you think to yourself, “Why did I seek to end my suffering.” something inside of you screams no.

Like the other week , I was supposed to meet a friend but as the Covid laws got stricter we both decided it would be wise to rearrange . A few minutes after we cancelled a deep pit opened in my stomach and I felt sick with guilt and shame and anxiety. I began to sweat and cry and panic .

By the end of the conversation I’m a jabbering wreck just saying “sorry , I’m so sorry , I really am sorry “ .

259,"TLDR at bottom

So my Mother has been diagnosed with OCPD (obsessive compulsive personality disorder) multiple times by multiple medical professionals and has absolutely refused to even consider that she has a disorder. My little brother and I’s early childhood is filled with her screaming, name calling, and even being abusive over the most minor infraction of her rules. Her OCPD just scratches the surface when it comes to the well of personality disorders she suffers from, I think she may have some mild schizophrenia in there too. EVERY DAY my mother regales her friends and family members with stories of her direct conversations with God, Jesus, the Saints, and people who are dead/dying. I believe she suffers from body dysmorphia based on comments she has made about herself and her extremely low self esteem since I was a child. There has never been a period of my life where she wasn’t mad a my father for something. My parent’s marriage is in tatters over things that happened 30+ years ago. Mother WILL NOT let the hurt go. My father is worn down and has no empathy for her anymore. I can barely leave my room for fear of breaking down every time I see her. I am torn between being hurt from her words/actions and feeling bad for her because her disorders make her so unhappy. I honestly believe she will be miserable until her death and that breaks my heart. Part of me is just waiting for her to die because then she wont be sad anymore. I need help. 

TLDR: 
My mom suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Body Dysmorphia, and possibly mild schizophrenia (she talks to god and he talks back). I need help coping with all the pain she brings me while also being less co-dependent on her happiness while I am forced to live at home.",02Nov2020,1

Now I have one pill left and have called the office twice, they’re saying they’re going to “remind” her again to call it in. For reference, the appointment was on Friday at 1 pm. I haven’t heard from her and have no direct line (she told me to call the front office so that’s the only contact I have).",02Nov2020,1

272,"I don't know if this is the right place, you can direct me to a better one if you know of it. I (18F) suffer from insomnia. I can usually control it very well. I have even learnt to control it enough that I could take on a small job from 6-8:30 Am 3x per week.  It does require me to go to bed at 8 Pm, for me to be able to sleep at least 7 hours by falling asleep at 10:30 (yes, it does take me at least 2 and a half hours). 

However, there are some anxiety triggers which make me lose my rythm for a few weeks. last week I had a falling out with another employer. She was quite abusive, and got very aggressive, started screaming at me 30 cm from my face. I quit immediately and left. However for the next few days I was experiencing quite bad anxiety attacks and stress from it. After two days, my emotions normalized, so I thought that the lack of sleep was over.

 However, ever since that day I have not slept. Usually, my insomnia will cause me to have a very hard time falling asleep, but then my sleep is solid until 8 Am, when regardless of when I went to bed I will inevitably wake up.  This time, it is not just harder to fall asleep (last night it took me 6 hours!) But my sleep is very light. I wake up at every single sound, my parents turning in bed on the other side of the apartment (their bed is new and doesn't creak or even my dog sighing in her sleep). And I cant sleep past 5 Am. 

I get horrible migraines which make me unable to see for a few seconds. And my heart during the night is constantly racing. It never quits. I have been trying to go to bed at 8 in evenings like this, but I won't be asleep until 2 Am.
I have no idea what I should do about it or if I need advice.

I don’t think I’m capable of it but, I have been thinking about it a lot recently. I’ve always self harmed in minor ways. When I was younger I’d pull out my hair, scratch my face, bite my hands etc. In recent years it’s mainly just scraping/picking at my skin. But recently I’ve thought about what it would be like to cut myself. Would people care enough to notice? would it help? I am well aware that this sounds dumb. I obviously know that I shouldn’t cut. Another part of my Brain is saying that I SHOULD be cutting because I’ve been this way for so long. That other people do it so are my mental health issues even that bad? If I do it does it prove how much I’m suffering? (makes no sense, I know) I’ve already noticed that  isolating myself from everyone but, I don’t know what to do about it.

I was just wondering if anyone feels the same way or what to do about it. Recently I feel like I'm really tired (although I'm getting over 8 hours of sleep every night) and fed up with pretty much everything. I seriously lack motivation and dont feel like doing anything. I feel like quitting my job and just doing nothing. I cant seem to shake the feeling that everything is pointless and in the end nothing I do is really going to be worth anything. I like to believe that I am quite logical and maybe this is why I feel this way because realistically all of us will work a 9-5 until we retire and then spend the years until our passing doing nothing because we are not as physically able.

At the end of the day I dont feel like I am depressed but for about 2 years I just haven't really felt comfortably happy, of course there are odd things that create temporary happiness but in the long run I probably would say I'm not happy.",02Nov2020,1
279,"Okay so i’ve just been wondering this for a while now. I do some pretty weird things that i’ve learned are often signs of mental illnesses and disorders but i don’t know for sure. 

I do intend to ask my doctor or therapist about these things, but i find it hard to explain to them. Btw, i’m a teenager with anxiety and possibly depression, thought that might be important. 
Please answer if you might have an idea, it doesn’t matter if you only answer one or all. Any answer is needed :))

1. Repeating things
—————————————————
So the first thing i’m wondering about is that i constantly feel the need to repeat things. Not because i think others can’t hear me or anything like that. I often repeat it days later. But i always need to repeat it. Like, i’ll talk about my week plans and then i’ll have to list what to do over and over again throughout the day and talk about that several times. It may sound normal but it’s so hard to explain. I NEED to repeat it over and over in some form to be satisfied. 

2. Obsessing
—————————————————-
This may seem normal as well but i’m still a bit concerned. So i often come over something interesting, like a celebrity or a movie or something like that. The more i learn about it the more interested i get, obviously. But i’ll obsess over that thing for months. For example, right now i’m obsessing over the fact that i need to live my life in Greece. I’m also obsessing over a celeb. I search up pictures and posts about the thing im interested in and spend hours every day just thinking about it. It’s all i think about. And it connects to the repeating thing. I feel the need to mention and talk a LOT about these obsessions over and over even if i say the same thing again. Again, may seem normal but it consumes my life so much and it doesn’t feel healthy.

3. Daydreaming?
——————————————————
This i know is not very normal, at least i don’t think it is. Ever since i was little, i’ve had my own little world with my own characters that i visited when i went to bed. I’m a daydreamer, basically. As i got older, my dream worlds started to get more.. realistic? Not quite but i can’t find the word. Well anyways, i often base my daydreams on my new obsessions that i mentioned. For example (this is very embarrasing but oh well) i’m very infatuated with a celeb right now. I base my main daydream on me being married to that celebrity, or possibly just a good friend (i alternate) i often do this with other celebs or fictional characters as well but this is the main dream. So for these daydreams i listen to music while i look at photos of the person i’m daydreaming of to get ‘material’ for my dream. Then i act out videos and tiktoks and made up scenarioes as the character i’ve made myself to be in this world where i’m married to that celebrity. 
I’ll spend hours on this every single day. In fact, whenever i’m out with others in school or just hanging with friends or family, i think about which videos i’ll act out next. 

I’m very concerned about the last one. I’ve done it for years and it consumes much of my time. I would like to add that i would in no way pursue the actor in real life, and this is purely in my mind. It is quite therapeutic to me and i feel stressed or depressed if i don’t do it for a while. However, i know that it is not normal and i need to know what this is.

If you finished all of this, thank you so much. I hope this was understandable. I apologize for some of the terrible spelling, English is not my native language. Thank you if you answer!",02Nov2020,1

My partner left me and I feel so empty. We were together for so long and I just know they are the person I'm suppose to be with but i ruined it. The love I have for this person is so strong and we have built so much of a life together as it is. I want to marry him, I want to have kids with him, I want to own more animals, have our own land, support each other, grow together, love each other unconditionally. 

I've ruined it all because I refused to help myself for years and never follow through with healing. I have bpd and I've let trauma affect my relationship and picked up on so many toxic tendencies and pushed my partner away. I hurt them so bad and I hurt myself. I have become a toxic person and hate myself so much for not seeing how bad I have gotten.

286,"A few months back I was put into a forced resignation situation at my old job. It was from a small mistake that I made, but after seeking legal advice, I found out that it was something that could have been avoidable and was unlikely a good enough reason for a forced resignation. When I had found out about my mistake, I instantly made an effort to try and fix it but at the end of the day, I felt like I was being treated as a disposable employee since the employer made no effort. I was instructed not to contact the other person involved. 

The industry I am in has been hit extremely hard by COVID-19. There are next to no jobs available, which is making it next to impossible to find new work in my industry. The friends I had at this old job, have completely shut me out and no longer talk to me. Its been very tough for me to move on, and knowing that I won’t be able to do what I love for a while is making me hurt. 

On top of that, I have a tremendous fear of a lack of future job prospects due to the fact that this will come  in interviews in the future. I do not defend the mistake that I made, but I worry that future employer’s will simply look at what happened and not consider all the details and the fact that the relationship did not need to end the way it did. 

I won’t be seeking legal action against the company for various reasons that I will not go into. 

The combination of the treatment I got from my old employer, on top of the a stress about the future is really upsetting.

294,"Hi reddit peeps, I wasn’t quite sure what community fits my issue so please direct me to a more suitable one if you know any.

I am an almost 30 year old woman and have unfortunately always been quite insecure about my looks. I am not superficial about other people but I am superficial when it comes to my own looks and can be quite hard on myself. 
I hear compliments that Im quite attractive/pretty. However to me, i feel good enough at least when someone is facing me, I am tall, thin, I have long black hair and defined eyes/eyebrows but my nose UGH just takes away all of that. When you look at my side, I have a longer than usual pointy nose,not like the wicked witch of the west (I hope)but its quite prominently pointy and to make matters worse, I have small dark freckles on the tip of it. 

I pushed myself to be a model for a couple of years to improve my self confidence but I wasn’t casted a lot, probably because of my un-petite nose and I was even told by a makeup artist that my nose is “difficult” to work with. Ever since I was young, I’ve felt super insecure to the point that I would avoid large crowds or social clubs because I didn’t want people noticing it. Until now I can have some nice clothes on and have my hair and makeup done nicely and then I look at my side and feel disgusted and like I want to hide it from people. I constantly put my hand over it if some people are walking past me. I was really insecure with my ex boyfriend because I thought he’d want to be with someone who looked like today’s bloggers and whatever you call them with their perfect petite noses. I really want to have a nose job but I can’t afford it and never could plus Im also scared because I know these things can go wrong and I also have a mental phobia where I have panic attacks when I feel like I can’t breathe.

An hour passes, and I have since forgotten why I even logged in in the first place. Why?

Let’s track back for a second.

You’ve probably heard of this idea before.

&gt;Our minds are home to three distinct voices:  
the **parent**  
the **child**  
and the **adult**.

The concept comes from *Transactional Analysis*, a theory in psychotherapy that helps identify recurring patterns in human behaviour.

So what do the **parent**, **child**, and **adult** voices say, and why does that matter? 

Here’s a simplified explanation:

    The child wants, and it gets.

It’s driven by curiosity and desire. If it doesn’t get, it complains. It might even break stuff. It doesn’t know self-control.

    The parent reprimands and punishes.

It’s self-righteous, and can be condemning. It’s got high expectations.  
*“You always do this…”*  
*“You never listen…”*  
*“How could you be so \_\_\_\_?”*

You get the idea. It tends to demand too much self control.

    The adult voice is balanced and reasonable. It understands.

It’s how we might comfort a friend after they’ve made a mistake.   
*“It’s okay, sh\*t happens. Don’t beat yourself up.”*

The adult gets it. It doesn’t judge.

#### All three voices work within us at different times, and triggered by situations.

Personal examples:

**The child.**  
It doesn’t matter how many unread books sit in my Kindle library, the moment I see a big price drop in my wishlist, I’m *so* tempted to buy it.

They call it a ‘felt concept.’ Meaning, the child is really innocent - it just follows the feeling. Whenever I feel upset because I don’t get something I really want, it’s often the child in me.

**The parent.**   
Well, I am a parent, and I hate to admit this - my expectations can get the better of me, and frequently do. I almost instantly regret it but it’s like a pre-set reaction.

The parent voice is a ‘taught concept.’ Sadly, many of us were taught this way as kids, and it may take years or decades to unlearn.

**The adult.**  
Being reasonable is a learned concept. Isn’t that encouraging?

For me, during an upset, sometimes it just takes a few deep breaths and thinking out loud. By expressing the problem clearly, I find myself looking for a solution in a more reasonable way.

&amp;#x200B;

We can learn to rely on the inner adult voice by invoking it when the other two are out of control.

This is the part I want to emphasize on.

Let’s say, you find yourself standing before the open fridge and thinking,  
*I don’t remember why I opened the door, but now that I’m here, I’ll eat something.*

That’s probably the inner child who’s often ‘hungry.’   
Instead, put a little sticky note in the fridge that says: **“Adults only.”**  


Suppose you’re spending too much time on social media.   
You don’t realize when getting sucked in but at some point you’re going to notice it.

That’s the time to say:  
***“*****The adult in me is here now.**   
**What would I rather be doing at this moment?”**

The adult within will gently point the way. No blaming, angry parent needed.

### Invoking the adult doesn’t take effort.

It’s not about self-control or resisting anything. It’s just about becoming aware.

When we sit down to eat, when we unconsciously grab the phone, when we enter the candy-store (or the amazon wishlist), it just takes becoming aware.

We say hello to the inner adult and we become conscious of how the inner child wants to take over.

Becoming aware gets easier as we ask for the adult’s help more and more.

The more we do, we realize how much of our behaviour is just a set of unconscious programs triggered by situations.

By becoming conscious we find it easier to get off the willpower-and-subsequent-guilt cycle. The power of consciousness starts to take care of it effortlessly. Try it today.

Even if there isn’t I can accept it because I’ll still be part of the universe or whatever even in death even if I’m not aware, it’s just a change. But when I think of the idea of how my family or a potential significant other will one day die (god forbid before me) it just sends my stomach into a twist. I’m disturbed by the fact that there will be a last time I hug someone dear to me forever. The idea that they just won’t exist as them anymore is horrible.",02Nov2020,1
298,"I randomly experience this powerful feeling where suddenly everything feels unreal. I look at my hands and it's as if they aren't my own. I perform an action, such as walking, and it doesn't feel like I'm the one walking. It doesn't even feel like I have control over my own thoughts when this happens. I start thinking absurd things like ""Am I real? Is anything real?"" But now I'm wondering if those thoughts really are absurd. It used to happen maybe once a week, but now the feeling arises multiple times a day. I feel like I'm losing my grip on what the hell reality even is. What should I do?",02Nov2020,1
299,"To preface this, I'm a 26y guy, I know I suffer from at the very least anxiety and depression, but unfortunately have been unable to be properly seen and honestly don't know when I'll be able to get seen (covid, no job, no insurance, etc)

I started experiencing occasional auditory hallucinations maybe a year ago? When I had a very extreme case of insomnia that caused me to stay awake for three days, when I fell asleep I heard a woman whispering and what sounded like metal scrapping against metal. 

Since then every few weeks I've heard some sort of auditory hallucination, usually it's a sound rather than voices, such as metal or glass crashing, or some sort of mechanical/machinery type noise. The only time I can think of that I heard voices (beyond the first) was me coming back from grocery shopping later in the evening, upon reaching my door I could hear what sounded like a conversation between two people, I couldn't understand what they were saying but somehow I knew they were talking about me. It was so clear and loud that I thought for sure I'd left the TV on but I hadn't, and my mother who was with me at the time told me she didn't hear anything.

I understand no one here could diagnose me - I'm just wondering if this is something that is normal? Can anxiety/depression cause this?",02Nov2020,1
300,"Hello, I’m a 17 year old female who struggles with many different disorders. I’m not quite sure what is going on with my body and it’s gotten to the point where I’m so used to the feeling of being sick, I don’t even worry about what’s going on.

I’m not sick as in, I get colds or other illnesses spreading around. I’m sick in general. I feel like I know why, but at the same time I don’t know how to help it.

I apologize if this is hard to read or jumbled, I have DPDR so I can’t really comprehend what I’m typing to the best of my ability at the moment. 

I don’t eat much, maybe one meal a day at that. It started months ago because I struggle with reflux (I have medication) so I often can’t swallow food without throwing it right back up. I already have to take around seven pills in the morning so I try not to cause my reflux much more reaction, as I don’t want to throw up the pills.

I’m healthy, healthy weight, healthy skin, everything is normal. I do have low blood pressure but it isn’t too bad, it just means I have to stay hydrated. But I have a problem with that, ever since I was a kid I really only get through half a water bottle a day. It’s been an ongoing issue and I have reminders on my phone to remind me to drink, but it seems like no matter how much I drink I’m still as sick as I was before.

I can’t stand for long or I start to see black spots and my head becomes wobbly. The world already looks so off from my derealization that the effects I’m getting from standing don’t change much, but they add another layer of difficulty. I can’t drive anymore nor leave my house, I’m falling behind in class and I can’t shower unless it’s cold and I have a chair to sit down in.

I’ve had leg issues for years, did physical therapy because they told me that my muscles were abnormally weak. They still are weak and feel strained, so it didn’t help much at all. I have balance issues because of this so I can’t balance on my feet well, often wavering, limping, or tripping as I walk.

I have horrible tremors in my whole body, my hands especially that it looks like I’m absolutely freezing my ass off by how much I shake. Though all test results come back negative and say I’m perfectly healthy.

Doctors like to say that anxiety is my issue, but I’ve had GAD since I was seven and I find it hard to believe that my anxiety is making me faint constantly when I’m not in the least a bit anxious, I’m more frustrated if I’m being honest.

I’m really struggling, nothing hurts (except my legs that ache) but I’m always in a state where I need to sleep so I don’t throw up or faint. I try to eat what I can but it just comes right back up. I never had an eating disorder either, so I have no idea what’s going on. 

This has been going on for around 2 years now. My derealization started around 2 years ago as well but I don’t know.

I just need opinions and thoughts, I want to get better because honestly I’m so worn out I can’t get anything in school done nor can I even do basic tasks.",02Nov2020,1

305,"Hi, everyone. This is my first post on Reddit. I apologize in advance if this is too long or boring to read. I just need to talk, even if nobody responds.

I’m a 16 year old boy in the USA and my mental health has been all over the place for years. I have such a comfortable life— supportive family, some nice friends, an easy middle class lifestyle, a safe town, and enough wits and strength to carry me through life. Everything should be going well for me, but it simply isn’t. I’ve been depressed since I was in sixth grade, and I’ve been tumbling in and out of suicidal ideation ever since. I simply can’t explain how it all started.

I only ever told two people that anything was wrong. The first person I told was this girl in middle school who I really shouldn’t have talked to in the first place. I was an idiot looking for someone who wanted to talk to me, and she sure did want to talk to me. In fact, she was a bit of a stalker. I didn’t even care. I let her get close to me. I would tell her how nothing in my life could make me happy for long, how I wanted to die. She used that weakness to manipulate me, making me do all sorts of stuff I didn’t want to do.

I experimented with self harm. For the next 3 years after that, I would semi-regularly cut my arms. Then I met the second person I told about how I felt— a girl who I became friends with in ninth grade. She had problems much like mine, but was much more chaotic and likely to get hurt. All of that weighed down on me so much, until eventually she became like the first girl and it all went downhill from there.

Nowadays I have friends, but none of them get it. I can’t bring myself to say anything to anyone— not my friends, not my family. I always keep up a façade of being happy and energetic, of being extroverted and motivated, but I really never want to do anything at all. My family is proud of who they think I am, but they don’t know who I really am. That’s why I’m living a lie. I’m so afraid of either being manipulated or being exposed for who I really am that I just wanted to vent to the internet. 

What puzzles me the most is exactly how I feel. I’m really bad at staying in touch with my emotions, and I am afraid of showing anyone how I truly feel at any time. There’s so much I can do, but I never want to do any of it. I just spend my time forcing myself to get out of bed and pretend. I’m not really a danger to myself, it’s just dumb and it just feels good to say.

So, yeah. That’s kind of it. I’m not really expecting anything in particular to happen by posting this, but if you read this thanks for listening. Sorry that this lacks actual structure, I’m just writing this in one go.",02Nov2020,1
306,"I saw a video once of someone having what the video called an ""ADHD episode"". The symptoms in the video happen to me frequently and I thought they were totally normal. Here's a list of symptoms I've compiled on my phone mid ""episode""

&amp;nbsp;


I've gotten yelled at as a child before for leaving the sink on a little bit (did not shut it off all the way) and ever since that day, I became very anxious on whether or not I did everything correctly. For example, even as an adult now, every time I use the washroom, I press down on the faucet handle hard to make sure it is 100% closed. I will then walk to my room and lay in bed to get ready to sleep. The thought of whether I really turned off the sink completely or not crosses my mind and I will feel uncomfortable even though I know I shut it off completely. Since the thought lingers in my head, I will feel very uncomfortable and will not be able to sleep until I go back and check AGAIN even though I know I turned it off!

&amp;nbsp;



I do this with almost everything, not just the sink. Am I experiencing childhood trauma from being yelled at for the sink incident? The same happens with the garage door and the stove. Once I leave the house and drive to where I'm going and ask myself if I really did turn the stove off or not, I will drop what I am doing and drive all the way back home, even if it's 5 miles away, and check if I turned it off even though I know I did!

Things are starting to be more strained for me after I lost my cool when I was talking to someone I’m seeing (not necessarily dating). After that (something like this happened before), I told her that if I ever become abusive or a “bad person” to just forget about me. I didn’t think about how saying that would have hurt her, especially after how close we became. It feels like our relationship strained to the point that I don’t know how things will be between us after. We tried to talk it out, to some success but the relationship between us is still in question. The only thing I really left that brief conversation with for the short-term is that I gotta fix myself, especially my mindset.

I’ve been in the process of getting a reference for a psychiatrist, which has gotten complicated after the first psych office was closed down and currently in the process of finding another one. Came to the conclusion that therapy is necessary and that I’m still struggling with depression. Though, I probably need to change my mindset if I’m really going to get out of this rut.

320,"I (21M) recently became a lot closer with an old friend of mine (21M), which is appreciated, but also, now it seems I am his only support structure/the only person he shares his feelings with. To be fair, the reverse is also true.

Dude has a lot of issues that I won't get into here but they bother him constantly. He also only works part time and I'm a full time student taking 17 credit hours with two part-time jobs and trying to manage grad school applications somewhere in there. He wants to hang out pretty much constantly which I would be okay with, but I'm super busy. I already spend pretty much all of my free time with him and feel a bit like I'm neglecting my other friendships. Also as the December 1st deadline for grad school comes up, I have much less time than normal as I scramble to finish up all of my applications. I told him as much and he seems pretty understanding.

But, again, I'm pretty much his entire support structure, so I get constant updates about his mental health. I really want to be able to drop everything and help him when he needs it, but it's getting to the point that I'm just very overwhelmed and I'm butting up against some hard deadlines that I can't miss and I really don't have time for it. I do feel like such a shitty friend though.

Again, he is most of my support structure too, but I'm a bit more stoic than him. My issues are mainly depression and suicidal ideation, his are more along the lines of PTSD. I noticed that he tends to stress over my issues as well so I've ""gotten better"" on that front in hopes of reducing the stress on him so he won't have to rely on me as much, but it doesn't seem to be working that well.

I'm frantically trying to cram for an exam tomorrow morning and he's having a mental breakdown. I'm not doing very well in this class (calculus) and I need it to graduate next semester so I really need to do well on this exam. Every fiber of my being just wants to grab my gun and end the whole ordeal right now but 1) he would be in a real fucked place without me, 2) it would really fuck him up if I died and 3) it would really, really fuck him up if I killed myself, so I suppose that's off the table. I just feel trapped right now.

He asked me if he should stop telling me what's up with his mental health right now since I'm really busy and I'm not sure what to tell him. It feels shitty to say ""well, school is a bigger priority right now so yep, I'm going to need you to keep your issues to yourself."" But I'm also just not entirely sure I'm capable of supporting him right now.

I also can't deal with his current way of ""not bothering me about his issues"" which mainly involves texting me about how he's hungover since I wasn't available to talk last night so he got drunk. This is especially stressful for me because my now-ex girlfriend did the same thing to me before I broke up with her, except with self-harm instead of drinking.

I feel like I don't have enough time for the whole interpersonal relationships thing. I do want to support my friend but I'm running out of steam and I just feel nauseous all the time. Any advice on what to do or what to tell him on the whole issue of ""whether or not he should bother me about his issues"" would be greatly appreciated.",02Nov2020,1
