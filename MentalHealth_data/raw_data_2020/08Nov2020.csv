What about the shit i dont know I'm doing..",08Nov2020,1
1,"Hi I'm a 24 yo male. Recently I've been having really bad OCD (if it even is OCD) and anxiety. My OCD is weird like for example, today I looked up the meaning of a word and read the different definitions. I kept rereading the definitions from different websites and comparing them. It's hard to explain. I was scanning every word and trying to match them. I will have different rituals/compulsions all the time. Like not too long ago I would like apply pressure on my phone with my fingers or like move my earphones in different positions. When I do those things I get anxious and it's like my mind and thoughts are scrambled, like a blur. I feel insane, I used to have some OCD as a kid but haven't had it until this year. I seem to feel uneasy a lot and having this ocd out of nowhere. I am normally really confident and relaxed kind of guy but lately I feel like a mess and I'm scared. I'm scaree of my mind like right now I manage to control it but sometimes it feels like my feelings will take over and I will lose control. I went through a break, it's been nearly a year since my ex broke up with me. I hurt her and she said she slowly fell out of love with me. It was no doubt one of the hardest things I had to go through. I was so depressed all the time and getting high every night after work. I also lost my great grandad recently and didn't get to say bye as he lived in another country. I couldn't even attend his funeral due to covid. And I also got the news from my job that peopke will be made redundant and I am at risk. But I didn't lose my job. I thought this might be the cause of it but guess not as I will not be fired but I still feel like this.

I had this gut feeling that I needed to reach out to my ex and tell her to give me another chance. Because I am not the same person I was when she broke up and I still love her. But she made it clear it was over and I accept now there's no going back. I thought this was the source of my ocd/anxiety but I still feel the same. So now it feels like there are no reasons for my mental health being this bad which makes me feel worse. I try and manage my mind but sometimes the ocd really consumes me. I will spend so much time doing my rituals or compulsions. I still do them although it makes no sense to me and i know it's irrational. 

I guess I'm just looking for advice, has anyone had a similar experience? Right now I feel like a mess and like I'm constantly fighting to not crumble down mentally. I feel like I wont find anyone else, I work from home so I dont meet or know girls (but even when I was in the office, there is no one there I'm interested in). Where would I meet someone? I can't approach girls when I go out, I don't really encounter girls in my daily life. I tried tinder etc but to no avail. She was so great to me (my ex) and my rock but I fucked it up. And now this feels like a punishment, like it's what I deserve...",08Nov2020,1

I'm not sure what sub reddit to post this on so I hope this is an acceptable place. Apologies for the word vomit and it being really disorganised I don't want to read it too much. Hopefully I give enough detail and didn't forget anything that would be of help.

I was diagnosed with MDD and anxiety when I was 14 (I am 18 now). I seem to have borderline personality disorder and dependent personality disorder traits. I didn’t talk enough to my psychiatrists about my feelings back then because at that time I didn’t understand what was happening to me and why I was doing the things I did. When they asked me how I felt I didn’t know how to answer so I didn’t. They would’ve probably diagnosed me with some more things and I could’ve gotten better help. I am a pretty sensitive and timid person and have been my whole life. I was bullied a lot during childhood and adolescence. I tried my best to be strong and view myself as strong and unique but I was bullied so much that i started to despise myself and my pride was gone. As a child, I was very clingy towards my parents and always changing caregivers but they were all emotionally unavailable and I didn’t get the recognition and affection I needed I feel. Since I can remember, I’ve always felt empty inside and always need external forces to make me feel like a person and a sense of self. In school i had a lot of problems because of limerence and was outcasted because of my weird disturbing behavior. The friends I had in school made me feel like I wasn't good enough because I really tried my best to befriend other people and give them gifts or snacks but they always wanted to be with other people. I remember when I was 11ish or so I'd always buy my ""friends"" snacks or gifts so they'd feel how much I appreciated them but they always said something like ""I'm going to eat lunch with xyz. She's so cool and pretty"" I stood there just watching them walk away from me. I relied on my parents a lot emotionally but as I grew up they became more distant towards me and ignored and shamed me when I told them I needed to see a psychiatrist when I was 11 because my mind was torturing me. My parents were always very dysfunctional towards each other. I understand that my parents grew up with very hard lives and had to work a lot so I could have a way more comfortable and easy life than they did. And that they had no experience with mental health issues before and that mental health awareness wasn't really a thing during their time.

I started going on the internet and talking to people because I was so lonely and couldn’t talk about my feelings to anyone in real life when I was 11ish. I developed a porn addiction when i was 10 because it helped me cope with depression. It made me feel better after feeling so terrible and I compulsively watched it for hours and often watched it while crying. I’d make up terrible situations in my head where I was being abused and degraded by people while watching it. It was my unhealthy coping strategy from when I was 10-14. In grade 4, my mother was called in for a meeting at school with my homeroom advisor, she told my mother about my porn addiction. I started being sexual with people online from a young age because I was groomed by the people online because I was so naive and desired any attention I could get. I also had/have emotional eating problems because my best memories with my mother, father and family involved food. I ate a lot of food, compulsively watched porn and talked inappropriately with people online to cope with the stress, pain, depression and emptiness I was feeling inside. I became very angry towards other people and myself and started having homicidal thoughts due to suppressed frustration and no control over my inferiority. I started self harming and starving myself when I was 11. My mother remarried and we lived with her husband in a different country. My mother prioritised him more than me and I felt left out.  When I moved in with my stepdad I was not allowed to watch porn and had no way to cope. Many things happened and i acted out and started being moody. Breaking things in the house, being aggressive and hostile and self harming even more. My parents knew that i was homicidal and suicidal and it made things worse. I did pretty terrible things to myself and did a lot things that put me in risky irresponsible situations. I’ve gone through a lot of emotional trauma and some physical trauma when I was 10-16. My stepfather beat me twice, handed me a knife taunting me to kill myself and threatened to shoot me twice. The first time my mother used herself as a human shield but the second time she was angry at me and just let my stepdad beat me and whip me in the backyard where I was screaming for help. Both times he stomped on my head and strangled me. I tried to call 911 but they took the phone so I just screamed out the window for help. And my grandfather beat me once, tried to kill me and handed me a knife taunting me to kill myself but my grandma used herself as a human shield. Both my stepdad and grandfather have anger issues and emotional/physical trauma. Both of them didn't get in trouble because who believes or cares about the mentally ill teen? And my fault because I did stupid things that made them angry like destroying the CCTV because I thought it was going to shoot me and going to McDonald's to celebrate my birthday with friends and ended up being late to school, but i know it's still not ok. I was also at a methodist hospital where I was mocked and humiliated by the staff (nurses and doctors) while I was hysterically crying and yelling random things.

I did a lot of self-destructive things because of self-hatred and internal suffering. I’ve been to mental hospitals involuntarily 5 times. My mom out of frustration has told me twice that she wish she never adopted me and left me with my real mother that didn’t want me. We moved again and I had more problems with peers. I’ve been abandoned by all of my friends because of my self harming and being hostile against people. I became more and more depressed. Everybody seemed like they didn’t care about me. I became depressed and suicidal. Was sexually assaulted and bullied by more and more people because of my limerence problem. My mindset became: ""I'm gonna hurt myself and let other people hurt and take advantage of me it doesn't matter because nobody loves or cares about me i hope they kill me and beat me until I'm dead ill stop doing these things when theres somebody that loves and cares about me because i don't love or care about myself but i know that nobody will love or care about me because I'm a terrible person and my real parents didn’t even want me and for the past 5 years my peers have mocked and degraded me as a person” (I was taken advantage by older people because of this mindset) but its also confusing because i don't want to feel pain yet I was hurting myself like that. I really didn't want other people to hurt me more but I let them and I was going through a self-destructive downward spiral. Is it possible to involuntary voluntary hurt yourself this way? Somebody told me what I’m experiencing is black and white thinking which is common in bpd. I also let other people take advantage of me so I could have access to marijuana to distract me from my limerence problem. Honestly, it just made things worse and gave me panic attacks and hallucinations.

The times i had homicidal thoughts was only to cope with my feelings of inferiority and the times i was suicidal was the only time i could express that i was hurting and needed help. I also feel like medication I took also negatively contributed to my behavior and made me more impulsive and influenced the risky things I did.

I watched this video about Self Destructive BPD: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7frz5nBrWI&amp;t=178s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7frz5nBrWI&amp;t=178s) and this is the first time I’ve heard someone describe exactly how I felt. I feel better now and am healing. I now have a loving boyfriend who’s hurt by the things I’ve done to myself in the past.He gets upset because of it and says terrible things but I can’t blame him at all.  My personality started to change when I met him and it adapted/complimented his personality. I find it very hard to understand myself and other people don't understand me even more. This is his first relationship and first real interaction with a girl. There’s more backstory but I’m not going to get into it too much. I lied to him about my past for several months because I hate it so much. I allowed him to get a hold of my discord account and he read my messages to other people and he found out the truth of my past (including me being very sexual on the internet while very young and underage). But the way I’ve talked about my past with other people makes it seemed like I enjoyed it but I didn't. I think I made it seem like I did so I could convince myself that I was superior and wasn't just a nobody. I love him so much but I don’t know how to tell him that back then I had no foresight that I was going to encounter somebody that would love and care about me as much as he does and didn’t even know I was going to live this long without him getting upset. He thinks I was so promiscuous because of shallow reasons and shames me for it. Please don't say anything negative about him I know he's trying his best and I understand his behavior because I've also said terrible things and was very stubborn and close minded in the past.

The things I've been mainly struggling with now are feelings of emptiness, intrusive thoughts, no sense of sense and identity, the trauma I'm left with and worsening social anxiety.

Please give any helpful advice if you can with my relationship and any knowledge about the things I’ve been experiencing. I really want to know what they’re called so I can research about them. I am going to see a Psychiatrist soon and I am scared. Thank you for reading. I appreciate it very much.",08Nov2020,1

Holy shit. This is absolutely unbearable. I can hardly move. Ive been alone forever. I feel like noone, even close family, listens/understands my feelings. At all. Im never invited anywhere. I am an addict as well. Mental health issues my whole life and people eventually stop giving a shit. Society never gives a shit either. Everyone moves on but me. 

I still have a job unfortunately but like other jobs it seems it may leave my grasp soon. I can only take so much of staring at a computer or the four walls of my room. I dont even have my own place fuck my fucking life. 

I dont wanna die but I sure as fucking hell dont wanna live. Most of all, I just dont wanna suffer anymore.

It's just the lingering fear of being deployed somewhere and dying without being able to see my little brother one last time then putting my whole family in pain because of my death. I want the fuck out. I signed up because at the time I thought I needed it, but now I'm locked in for 4 out of the 6 years left of my contract and I would much rather loose a vehicle and have a broken leg or arm and be discharged then have this shit eat at me for the next few years.

6,"I've become more self-aware recently and am wondering if I should go to therapy. I've noticed that I've been at least somewhat depressed almost 3/4 of every year since middle school, and I always just wait for some event or something to kinda reset my state of mind. It usually works, but obviously I eventually fall back into it. Recently, my depression got to a point where I started pushing people away and treating them like crap, so I accepted that I needed to change something about this cycle. The first step was admitting to people that I was not really okay, and it feels good to not always keep it in. But still, I feel like somedays all of my energy is spent on just trying to not feel hopeless. It's becoming more frequent that I have days like this, and it isn't good considering I'm basically schooling myself right now and I have friends who need me sometimes too. I feel like I am in a place where I could break the ""cycle"" if my parents help me out, but I don't know where to start. I don't really want to go to therapy for many reasons, but is it the best solution?",08Nov2020,1

8,"I feel like the biggest failure right now. I am a 21 female graduating college in August. I can't seem to get an internship, though. I have joined countless jobs, got a mentor, met with multiple career centers, and networked. But still, nothing. My GPA isn't low. I see all my old friends in HS doing amazing while I can't even get something as simple as an internship. How will I ever be able to get a job? 

2. I currently work as a babysit Monday-Friday, and the only reason I am staying in this job is that the money is good. I have been saving over the last two years every penny I have ever made to have a downpayment on a duplex house. The kids treat me horribly. They constantly are putting me down and yelling at me. I have spoken to the parents, I have spoken to them and it's constant belittling. I feel like it's getting harder and harder to function or even go in. 

3.  Growing up, I always had lots of friends, even leading up to the last couple of years. I have switched colleges and of course, went on a different path than many of my friends.  I would say I only have a group of 5 friends I have grown up with, which is totally fine, except I think I outgrew them. Mentally and physically, we are just on two different paths. They quit school and just party all the time while I am actively looking for jobs or am working. I want someone I can connect to and have great conversations with while seeing continuing to set themselves up for success. I am not saying I am successful at all, BTW, but I think it's nice to want that. How can I make more friends? It's so hard with covid. I don't live on campus, I am all virtual, and I just switched to this school last semester. I don't even see my friends who I have now because they don't take covid seriously, and my sister has had health issues all her life, and I can't risk getting her sick. 

4. I am at least 15 pounds overweight since covid happened. I couldn't lose weight either. Every time I look in the mirror, I see how terrible I look. None of my clothes fit right. On top of that, I have acne everywhere on my face now. 

5. Yes, I see a therapist, yes I take antidepressants, and also I do have mild OCD that has definitely been made worse in my life because of covid. 

6.I sleep all day and then I sleep all night. My depression really has gotten the best of me and I feel like there is no up from here.  I love my family as well and super thankful for them, but they are driving me crazy always being home. It's no privacy and they are always asking if I am doing drugs which is nuts because I have never had one in my life. I just feel like my mental health is not great. I am going crazy every time I have to stay at home. My boyfriend is so good to me and I am so appreciative of him. I know we're going to get married but my issue is I feel like I don't even want to hang out with him because theirs nowhere to go and nothing to do. It's the same thing every single day and I am so tired of it. I just feel so trapped and lonely.",08Nov2020,1
9,"Hey, so idk how long this post will be or if it's even appropriate for this subreddit, here goes anyways:

I have a friend who lives in a different country who I used to play WoW and later sometimes CS and stuff with. He has a history of severe mental health problems all thoughout his life and has abused drugs HEAVILY for a long time (he says, and I have no reason to not believe him, he's been clean for 8 months or so with one relapse 3 months ago). He has attempted suicide once since I knew him, and according to him twice before. Now, I really didn't see him as close as a friend as he did see me for the longest time, but it still really fucked me in the head for a while, though I think I can easily handle it by now, I just came to the conclusion that if he dies some day, I've done everything I could to help him out, and he says so too. 

Starting with the topic at hand, since this would get too long otherwise: Over the last week or two, he has been complaining about a gang of 20-30 people, youths and skinheads, who are continuously breaking into his apartment and taunting him. So I've read about gangstalking before, I'll leave a link in case you're unfamiliar with it [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic\_harassment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_harassment) . His case is defnitely not the ""cult"" thing described here, but his symptoms are very similar in many aspects. For example, when I asked him for proof of this targeted harrassment, he says he can not send pictures or videos of them, because as he sends them, they are altered through a virus they have installed on his devices, that replace the footage of random shit, he says sometimes it's 80's vintage porn or pictures of ""monsters"", or even pictures of kittens. This is LITERALLY the same story I read from someone on /r/gangstalking who says he is a targeted individual. 

Furthermore, he said the guys even follow him to his dad's house. He just told me there was a kid hiding behind the couch and staying around the place for 16 hours. His dad denies seeing it, and it's sort of hard to get straight answers from my friend here. His thoughts seem somewhat more erratic than normal. I don't know if he knows about the gangstalking conspiracy stuff, but it is the sort of topic he would know about since he is on the internet most of the time, but he is definitely not reciting any of their stuff, or claim he's a targeted individual, as they call themselves. He also doesn't think it's the government or some greater thing, when I ask for motivation of their actions he says he doesn't know, and puts it down to teenage bullshitting (which obviously doesn't mnake a whole lot of sense).

&amp;#x200B;

He is and has been in therapy for a long ass time, as I said he is struggling with his mental health since being a kid (he has Asperger's).

Yea so, it's really late but he just chatted me up so I decided to ask for help/opinion on this. I hope this is somewhat readable, there is a loooooot of information that I could still provide, just let me know if you would like to know anything, I really tried to keep this as short as I could.",08Nov2020,1

14,"I’m usually good at school. I’m in the top classes for most of my classes, and find most of them easy enough to stay there for a few years. Recently because of the grade I moved into, everything has amplified it’s difficulty. And I can’t tell wether it’s me, or school but the things I used to be able to do easy enough, are now impossible. I cannot, for the love of god, write paragraphs about analysing a book anymore. I cannot, work independently anymore. I’m just falling behind and it makes me scared, and makes me feel so so...worthless? I know the grades I get right now don’t matter but there is still something inside that cries and breaks down whenever I think of doing it. 

Friends... normally I have a few good friends. In January I cut them off and isolated myself until we went back to school after quarantine. I became friends with them again and for a month ish, it was nice. However the novelty worn off and I remember feeling so alone with them. My main 2 friends have now became closer with some people I’m not close with, which I am totally fine with. However now they barely talk to me, and I normally have to start the conversation. My few other friends never text me unless I text them first and a lot of the time they don’t even reply and just leave me on read. I know not to put effort into those who don’t do the same for me and in all honesty, I don’t care about not being friends with them. It’s the only talking to 1 person, it’s the feeling so so lonely and isolated. Normally I don’t care, but with school going on, I wish I had someone to talk to about the school stuff and actually help each other with it. 

Misophonia, it’s a neurophysiological disorder of which certain sounds set off the fight or flight reaction. It’s torture. I can’t go on my kitchen to get a drink if someone if in there eating, drinking or even talking on the phone in there otherwise I feel panic, rage, fear, distress all in one. I’m currently crying because i can’t fall asleep as all I can hear it the vibrations of my moms voice and the emotions are just, difficult to say the least. Because of this, my life feels ruined. I can’t sit and watch a movie with a family member. I can’t eat a meal. I can’t even have a quick discussion without feeling those emotions once. It follows me everywhere and it drains me. I feel guilt for having the intrusive thoughts I have, I feel disgust towards those who trigger me and then feel guilty because of that. I don’t know how to explain it, but it just ruins my life even if I’m not triggered all the time. It drains me, and I have no energy for anything because of it. Just thinking about my misophonia makes me cry.

I don’t know exactly what I want to get out of posting this. Maybe encouragement, i suppose. 

In the last two years of my life I screwed up a lot of things. My physical health is poor, my mental health is poor, I don’t have any close friends, and I lost my girlfriend 4 months ago, who I still deeply love and wish I was with. I just feel hopeless. Like it’s over for me. When I was 19 it felt like the whole world was ahead of me, but now I feel like by the time I get my life together, it’ll be too late for it to be enjoyable. Maybe I’m just assuming that life is only fun in your early 20’s, I don’t know. But I just have no hope that I’ll find a partner again who I feel love for, good friends, hobbies. It’s just all hopeless and I am really having a hard time feeling this.

18,"hi, I'm sorry to make such a long post on here but I don't know where else to go. I also didn't know which flair to use. I'm sorry if it's wrong.

for context I'm 24 F from ON, Canada. 

So, in November 2019 I became extremely sick with symptoms such as coughing, coughing up blood and dark mucous, shortness of breath, loss of voice, difficulty breathing, constant fevers, etc. I was misdiagnosed two different times with pneumonia, put on two different types of antibiotics and given two kinds of inhalers but I remained sick, getting worse. I also had CT scans on my heart and lungs, X-rays on my lungs, ECGs, a pulmonary function test, bloodwork... you name it, and there were no conclusive results. This was all before there were any tests available for Covid-19, of course, and by the time I could be tested for that it was too late. 

So, I ended up having to leave my place of work, taking a sick leave in January of 2020 because I was still unable to use my voice, I had an uncontrollable cough, and I could barely stand most days. I only regained my voice in April of 2020, and even still it's not quite the same. I am \*still\* in November 2020, experiencing a persistent cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, chest pain, extremely low stamina, nausea, memory issues, and other symptoms that affect my daily life in a major way. I attempted to return to work in October 2020 out of pure necessity because we feared we were not going to be able to pay our bills (government assistance for COVID had stopped) but I only made it 2 weeks of extremely short shifts and light duties before my boss and I agreed I should look for at-home work, as I struggled a great deal to breathe while just standing and talking to customers. 

This is devastating for me, because I have never gone so long without working before, and being stuck inside the house all the time for so long (longer than the pandemic!) has made my depression so much worse. Not to mention the financial worry that my fiancé and I are going through right now, he is the only one working at the moment and we cannot live off of his income. I am trying to apply for ODSP (disability) as well as any at-home job I can find. I am desperate at this point and every time I think about my situation I burst into tears. This is not how I thought my life would be at 24. I am strongly suspicious that I had an early case of Covid as I worked in a public place that attracted tourists and I am suffering some long-term effects from it but even an antibodies test would not show anything after all this time... I just want to feel better... I want to go to work, start my life, have my wedding... I can't do any of that while I am still sick with this undiagnosed illness and while we have barely enough money to make rent. I am barely able to hold myself together most days. 

I don't know what I'm expecting from posting this but I just need to get it out of my head and into words. Thanks to anyone who read. &lt;3",08Nov2020,1
19,"I know that self-diagnosing isn't a good thing to do, but I just need to get it out of my system. I think I might be on the autism spectrum (I'm talking about high-functioning autism). I've been experiencing symptoms of both autism and depression since I was a kid, but I was never diagnosed by a professional with autism (depression yeah, but that was a long time ago and I don't take any medication anymore)

Recently I felt brave enough to bring it up to my mom. I said that I read about in a lot on the internet and that I took a test online which said that there's a strong possibility I have autism (I know, internet tests are just Internet tests and shouldn't be taken seriously but I didn't know how to start a conversation with her) and I just said that I think it actually might be true. She just laughed a little and said it's impossible and I felt like a piece of shit. I know that if I got a diagnosis, it wouldn't change anything. Something like that isn't an excuse for my behaviour or anything. But I still think about it and wonder if I would feel even a little better if it was true. I don't know. 

Right now I think that I'm just a pathetic fuck that's desperately looking for an excuse. I'm a spoiled white kid who's never had any real problems. I don't do anything productive with my life yet I'm so tired I can barely move. Tired mentally and physically. Or that's what I kept telling myself for so long that I believed it.

22,"I’m a 27 year old adult who was diagnosed with ADHD and manic depressive disorder since I was a kid. I’ve seen quite a few therapists, and morning has truly helped me so far. I feel like my life is falling apart. Well, my life has always been a hot mess, but I recently decided to really try and take charge of my life. I’ve been working on my credit, trying to save money, and going to college. But I’ve been having such a difficult time keeping it together and I keep losing everything I’ve worked for, mostly due to my impulsive nature, complete inability to focus, and my manic depression. So I recently went to a local mental health center. I did an intake form and everything, and she set me up with a therapist. What I really want at this point is to try medication (I’ve never taken medication before and I would like to see if it can help stabilize my moods and help me with maintaining focus and motivation).
So I’m kind of really bummed that I seem to be having such a difficult time getting in touch with a psychiatrist.

29,"Okay so, I'm a 16yo highschool and college student, I take concurrent enrollment classes on top of my hs classes (something very nice tbh). I also work a part time job. The problem is that the only things I do are school and work. It's not that I never want to do things I love, in fact, I REALLY do want to (see I have this story I want to write berry badly and it's on my mind very often, I also love drawing) do them, it's just that the moment I've finished the week's homework or get of work I loose all motivation to do ANYTHING. All I do is lay around worrying about grades and waste time feeling terrible. 
It feels like all I know how to do is work, but I hate working so much because of the emotional stress it causes me. And yet I never do anything but it (and I only do that much because it scares me too much not to do it). I've also got a lot of junk going on I'm my life too, which one would think may be part of the cause (and maybe it is) but I honestly feel nearly nothing about them when I should probably be sobbing because of them. The only thing I've cried about in a long time is class, and I do that a lot.

Anyway, I'm talking about this because I really (first) want to know what the crap is going on with me (I've been like this all year) and (second) what I can do to fix it (and how I can get myself to do the things that may fix it even though I don't want to do anything).

30,"My mental health has overtaken me over these few months, and it’s an odd feeling to notice yourself change when you’re not making the conscious decision to change. When I was younger, I always had an intense passion for things in short bursts of time. When I was 7, I loved dinosaurs and visited hundreds of museums learning everything about dinosaurs. For Christmas my dad bought me a dinosaur encyclopedia, and out of curiosity I read it entirely. But then, after a month or so, the passion died, and I developed a passion for cars. The same events would occur for this new passion: books, museums... Any way I can learn about the subject. This process would repeat, continuing for new subjects until ultimately I arrived back at dinosaurs. 

This has been a loop that has consistently occurred throughout my life, and it never really bothered me up until the last few years. I decided I wanted to be amazing at one subject, since I yearned to know what an intense drive for one subject was. So, a few years back I decided that should be music. In the moment, I was in pure bliss: I was constantly improving my skills on instruments as well as composition, and I felt like I was going to be one of the “greats” one day. But then something happened: My passion switched to another subject, and that was writing. Suddenly I realized I was doomed. Now I was stuck in this loop from when I was younger again, except now I had a manic drive for every new subject. This process has continued to today. However, as I grew older, the process began overtaking my brain. I started to go through depressed bouts when I switched subjects, because I thought something was wrong with me. I wanted to blame my parents for not consolidating my skills when I was younger, I wanted to blame my younger self for not having enough self awareness to cultivate one skill. These depression episodes evolved over time, and now suicidal thoughts have entered them. All I can think about is how I’ll never be a master at something because I can’t focus my attention, and I feel like even when I tell my family or friends that I want to pursue one subject with intense passion, they look at me like a madman.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I wish I could understand more. In case any of y’all ask, I do attend therapy. However, these episodes (the depressive ones) don’t fall on the days where I have therapy ironically, so in the appointments I feel like nothing is wrong with me. I have had one appointment where I was in a depressive episode, but my emotions and thoughts were so extreme and “loud” that I couldn’t voice my concerns in a way that would get a proper response from my therapist. Thus, I’m left to myself. (I’ve also told people around me about my symptoms, but they think I’m acting so I can get prescriptions *sign*)",08Nov2020,1

The thing that's making it worse however is the fact nobody seems to care, it takes me weeks to work up the courage to tell people in my life and ask for help but when I do it's almost shrugged off. It's not just close friends and family that are doing this either, I've been to doctors and psychiatrists on multiple occasions and they just seem to do the bare minimum to help me, they always say they will put me on a list for a specialist etc. But they never follow through and I have to start over again.

34,"I hope an advice seeking post is okay. Sorry if this is the wrong spot.

I feel like maybe I need to seek a therapist, but I don't know how to start. Every time I get close to making an appointment I change my mind.

tl;dr I have addiction issues that I'm willing to admit, but I have other issues that come up when I'm drunk, related to my mom's struggles with bipolar disorder last year, and stupid things I did 10 years ago. Also I need help fixing my relationship with sex, but I'm too embarrassed to talk about it. I am intimidated by finding a therapist or accepting that it would even be worth our time. HELP.

I'm not overly depressed or anything but I know I am struggling with addiction on some level. I can and often do spend entire days browsing on my phone and when I'm not doing that I drink. Drinking could be okay, but I often go over the top into oblivion. The pandemic has been helpful because I'm not out embarrassing myself when I'm blackout drunk, so there is less shame involved. I still waste entire days being hungover though. I try to find other things to do, but I can't concentrate on anything so my days melt into one of those two activities. Chores fall behind, the house, my car are nightmares. I clean once in a while, but it's hard to stay focused. I don't drink everyday, maybe 3 times a week. I don't call off of work, but lately it's getting harder and harder to show up. I do my job well though, I've gotten two bonuses in a row, which is unheard of at my job, and constantly getting praised. I feel like I'm getting lazier and lazier though, so I don't understand it.

I sort of had a hard year last year, my mom went through a severe manic episode and nearly killed herself through general reckless behaviour four times, ending in a suicide attempt that put her into a coma for a few days. And I feel like I handled it pretty well, detached, she basically told me (and everyone else) to fuck off anyway, so what can you do but drive yourself crazy with her? But it keeps coming up when I'm drinking so I guess maybe I'm not over it. She's fine now though. But I only bring up the topic when I'm drinking so I think it's more of my over dramatic drunk personality, than the real me. They are her problems, not mine, so it's like I'm playing this weird 'victim' card, like 'pay attention to me' when it's actually my mom that had the rough go. Kind of unsightly behaviour I feel. I mean I'm not cold or anything, I went to see her as soon as she 'let me'. I visited her in the hospital after her suicide attempt when she was full of tubes and I've spent a lot of time with her since. So idk. I guess that's kind of fucked up, but it's weird to me to seek therapy because my mom struggled with mental health.

And then there is ancient history, I made a lot of bad decisions in my early twenties that put me in unhealthy situations. Drug  and alcohol abuse, a physically abusive relationship and then later a lot of I guess sexual 'trauma' that was mostly generated by putting myself in sketchy scenarios. I feel like that's on me, and also, OLD NEWS. I wouldn't even consider this worth bringing up but it is another embarrassing thing I bring up when I'm drinking and also I'm struggled to maintain an enjoyable physical relationship with my last two partners. I start to find sex more repulsive the closer I get to someone.  I feel stupid to try and talk about events this old, also I barely remember most of them, including what I was sober for, but something is definitely wrong with me when it comes to having a physical relationship, so idk. But I'm super uncomfortable talking about ANY of that stuff. I just want to put it behind me and forget it all together. 

Can a therapist help me stop playing the victim or being so melodramatic or do I just need to get my drinking under control or is some of this sort of reasonable to bring up??? I feel so dumb about so much of this. How do I even choose a therapist? There are so many! What do I say about why I am looking for therapy?? I'm addicted to stuff? I'm comfortable with that, but not the rest.

Thanks for reading. Basically, I'm kind of fucked up, but also might just need to stop getting black out drunk and maybe the rest will sort itself out.",08Nov2020,1

36," I was looking at some art by Shawn Coss last night because I was bored. A lot of his art is about mental illness. Then I got curious and started looking up lists of different mental illnesses. It was actually kinda cool if I'm being honest. After I searched up something like ""mental illness"" on Wikipedia. I started looking through the causes of anorexia and stuff like that because I'm interested in psychology. But then a mention of physical restraint popped up, which got me looking through all the different types of restrains. Since I've been physically restrained multiple times I started panicking and thinking about what it would be like to go through it again. I started crying right after because I was scared of the thought of being restrained again.

37,"Hello, writing this on a burner account as I choose to remain anonymous and don't want anyone I know to see this. Just want somewhere to document how I'm feeling right now but feel free to comment if you wish.

18 Male here. And I'm probably in the worst place mentally. Don't want to tell anyone in my personal life, because I feel like they will just dismiss it as me wanting people to feel sorry for me or wanting attention.

Recently, I've just felt like total shit. I've had this kind of feeling from time to time when I was younger, but I just dismissed it as being bored or sad for a few minutes. But recently there hasn't been one day or night where I haven't felt like utter shit. I don't really have anyone that I can talk about anything to. I have friends I suppose, but I'd probably be the last person they'd think about. And if course I've never been in a relationship either, when a lot of people I know have found a significant other, which makes me feel frustrated with myself now.

Just began my 2nd year of College a while ago (Sophomore, I think you American's call it?). I'm doing a course that I really like and that I have a large interest in, but ever since the pandemic hit in March or so, I have quickly lost motivation for it and just going through the motions at this point. Online learning sucks but it is what it is I suppose. When I first started my freshman year in Summer 2019, I thought life was gonna fucking rule after that. But I guess I just set myself up for dissapointment I suppose.

I feel like I've pissed everyone out of my life and I hate myself for it. I always get the vibe that I annoy or offend someone just by my presence and that leads to me being angry at myself. Even if I was to make a decision now to join a club, go to parties/dates, join a sports team etc to cure my loneliness, it's too late now because of lockdown which we don't know when it's gonna end or if it will end at all.

Just right now at this point of my life, I'm very confused as to where my life is heading, if it's going anywhere at all. I suppose I've been oblivious to the situation all this time and now I'm just realizing it at the worst time possible.",08Nov2020,1

Hi all,

Background: I’ve been really trying to eat healthier for the past few months. I recently became vegetarian and since then eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, eggs, some meat substitutes, and not many processed and sugary snacks. However, I’ve found that the strictness I’ve been imposing on myself has been really difficult on my mental health (I struggle with anxiety and depression and have some serious issues with perfectionism). In the past few weeks I’ve been having a tough time with the depression and so I’ve tried to relax a bit and allow myself some of my forbidden foods everyone in a while but lately I keep binging them whenever I have a taste of something “unhealthy”.

Does anyone have any advice for figuring out how to eat a healthy diet without being too restrictive? I’d like to hear either your story with it or advice for resources/websites/podcasts/etc I can look into? I just can’t get out of this cycle of restrict/binge. 

I don’t think I have an eating disorder but I do think it’s some disordered eating, but the whole thing really does take a toll on my anxiety and depression, either because I’m anxious about the unhealthiness of what I’m eating and potentially gaining weight or because of feeling like I need to never eat candy and stuff again. And the whole thing feeds into my depression and hopelessness that I can’t take care of myself. 

Thanks for any help!!!",08Nov2020,1
45,"I connected with someone during this miserable pandemic via a dating app. Last weekend things started off normally, I knew she had spent some time crying recently but that was my only indicator for potential self harm. After a pleasant first evening together I went home, spent the night at my place, (as I felt a day apart would be an appropriate amount of space having spent the night with someone I just met) but had mad plans for the subsequent night to spent the evening distracting each other from the election.

In stead. I went to her place the morning of the election after she asked for some company and help with eating and drinking. Upon my arrival I found her semi conscious, but It was not until the evening I was able to discern she had tried to take her own life. Thinking she had mostly recovered physically, and due to her desire for me not to, I did not call emergency services. I was unable to prevent her from making a second attempt on her life, as she had hidden the pills of note (I found everything I could  and removed it). 

She is a wonderful person, I haven't known her long, but it's easy to see that she's much more than the pain which has been defining her life recently. Mostly I just tried to be present, and supportive, I didn't say much and absolutely didn't judge her for her feelings. But It was completely overwhelming,  her suicidal thoughts were so nuanced, refined and familiar. By comparison, I felt like a child in front of an 18 wheeler unable to stop the inevitable. 

Another wrinkle is my own mental health situation, defined by a long term depression which was born of my closest friend's suicide in 2013. I still think of my friend every day, and miss him dearly even though it's been 8 years. I'm not sure if my experience with the realities of suicide make me more positioned to be supportive, or more vulnerable to having my life ruined by loss. Finding her body is an extremely sad reality I will have to accept if I want to enter into a relationship with her.

I try to be an extremely compassionate an emotionally intellectual and available person, but the absolute intensity of mortality has my judgement and emotional compass scrambled. She is currently on a small road trip (which I am very glad she survived to undertake).

55,"I was going to use a ""Need Support"" flair but this is more a vent than anything. Really long story but I guess it has to start somewhere. First time posting here as well so I guess a story is needed. A good bit of this story could be skipped out in the beginning but I felt it necessary to explain why certain events happened. 

 I'm currently 15, today (now yesterday a few minutes ago) just so happened to be my birthday (please don't wish my a happy day or anything, i will explain why). My mental health began declining somewhere around late 2018. I was probably 12 nearly 13 then and it was at the stage when you thought you had found love (romance) but it was all about filling a void you had or something like that. I had just entered my second year of secondary (high) school. Some girl I was mutual friends with decided to make a confession to me the exact day before our school year started (we go to different schools) about liking me and you know the rest of it by now - childhood crushes or whatever. At that time, even though I vaguely remember it, my relationship with my family members especially had started taking a turn for the worse even though I can't remember the specifics. My mind had already started filling itself with suicidal ideation, self harm etc. Back to the story at hand I guess, unlike other children my age I was ""no dating unless marriage is endgoal"" kind of person, societal norms and stuff will think that's even weirder for a boy(amab) to believe in true love and stuff like that but I didn't care. I had never had a confrontation like this before and 12 year old me was flustered and instead of just telling her no, said ""can we be friends first"". Now this was fine and all, but it really didn't end like. In the span of 3 months or so, way too much happened. This girl and I, we texted, went out of our way to find ways to meet up( very rarely though), and ""fell in love"" or something. I honestly don't know if it was but that's not the point. Oddly enough, she had her own mental problems as well. All of this pre-story snowballed into continuing to text, catching feelings, me not knowing how to handle these emotions affiliated with romance and existential dread at the same time, ended up cutting myself for the first time one fateful night, she had an event of pill popping (overdosing on common household drugs), and then things got even worse. My major traumatic experience prior to any of this, was my parents divorce (i didn't realise until as of now in 2020) which i disguised as a different (also trauma filled) certain event occuring with my dad accidentally showing me that I had a (half) brother that I never knew about until the age of 6 at some family event on his branch. I had forgotten about all of it but my dad visited our house (my grandparent's house where my mom and i live) one night and I sat down with my parents all to hear about my brother and memories randomly came flashing through me and people were crying including myself. They never planned to tell me so ""young"" but my brother had passed a national exam and had the qualifications to enter my school( considered prestigious despite being a free tuition school - government assisted, mostly Catholic church funded), and alas, he had chosen my school as his destination. And this happened all while this girl and I are continuosly trying to fill this void in each other and it only got worse. Skip a month or so and my other friend had texted me saying that this girl had an entire suicide plan and as someone ""close"" to her, I should reach out to her. Of course 12 year old me, not understand the meaning and weight of my words brought myself to message this girl I was mingling with. Words were typed. ""I love you"" ""please don't go"" ""you're all i have"" ""i can't live without you"" and last but not least ""let's leave together"" +  ""if you leave this earth i'll just follow right behind you"". Yup. This may have been all over text message but it was still a moment that it's occurence, I sometimes hate. If you've reached this far in the story, a pat on the back to you. Fastforward 2 years to late 2020. The past 2 years, I had spent ""vibing"", which we all know is codename for potential undiagnosed mental illness. I told myself for 2 whole years that I didn't have depression, that I never did to begin with. Somewhere in there, I started questioning my sexuality and came back with no answers just simply counting myself as "" somewhere there"" in the LGBT+. Early 2020, my country went into nationwide quarantine, schools were closed etc. This is where the real fun begins. Me now, decides that said event with said girl was just another stage in life to learn from and move on. And that worked for some time. Somewhere there in mid 2020, I kept seeing symptoms coming back, I kept denying it. Every week I had taken this test online provided by some health institution somewhere which give you a rating on a scale to say how likely it is you may have depression. Obviously it's not an actual diagnosis but it's my best bet on knowing if i'm stepping back into rough waters. Every week, the scores fluctuated but remained somewhere at ""not likely"" and ""slight chance"". Things happened again. Relationship with my family had never been fixed since 2018 and had thus only gotten worse. Being stuck in a house with 5 other people who constantly test your will to live is certainly fun. After sometime in about August, those weekly scores slowly started climbing, and that's when I knew something was up. Around then, I had came out to maybe 3 close friends that I know (irl) as simply ""not straight/heterosexual)"". Even though I never came out to any family members, the fact that they might just mentally torture (best term i could use that fit here) me everyday if they knew I was in those ""lbgt whatever you call them"", haunted/still haunts me. August into September was really the turning point though. Those scores kept getting very high, I ended up hurting (alwaysemotionally and sometimes physically) my family members and my friends (irl + internet met). I had/still have serious empathy related problems and that's another ""nightmare"" to add to my list of things I think I am riddled with. Also a few times I have had intrusive thoughts of hurting myself, others and one singular panic attack where I had an almost out of body experience, I felt a violent presence in midst and my adrenaline kicked in and told me to run. And I just stood there trembling. September, I had started (more serious) online schooling for my 4th year of school. Downhill we go. It started well but aftee two weeks went to absolute shit. I had a random jump in mental state from ""oh no, i think i'm unstable"" to ""HAHAHAHAHAHA"". I couldn't pay attention in class now, couldn't bring myself to write notes/ do assignments unless there was a due date attached to scare me into doing them. 5 weeks of absolutely bullshitting each class I had, my mom caught onto what was going on. How fortunate for me, she was more focused on my decreasing grades than the owner of said grades. Eventually I thought she even cared a little bit, offered to send me to therapy even though my 1) not easily open with strangers, 2) trust issues, told me to just outright say ""no"". And now I am constantly pestered about ""are you ok"", ""how can i help"", while this is great and all, all these statements are so, empty. They are the most i get. I know my mom cares, but I honestly think her parenting is also just not it, somewhat misguided in what he does. In the past 2 months, suicidal ideation is back in my mind. Self hurt is creeping aroundthe corner. Everyday I feel like just ending it all and feeling the sweet release of my last breath. It has gotten even to the point that I am vengeful, and am pleased with the fact that my sudden death woud be a lovely way to indirectly hurt my family. That knowing my mother's only son was no more, would be with her until the day she died. That's about it for the past occurences. Woooooooo that was a lot to get out. First time letting all of that out anywhere.


Final notes/ present situation: Everyday I feel closer and closer to doing it. I'm a mess. I burst out laughing when approached with questions that I rather break down crying to. I never got to the school work I missed out. Honestly it's the last of my concerns right now. I cope by painting, listening to music, writing poetry, practicing guitar, brushing my hair in a certain way and wearing colourful hairclips (some that were given to me by my sister, some i stole from my mother) in front of a mirror, looking at pinterest images of pretty people, and probably my biggest one- gaming. Luckily for me, my mother and step-dad, have taken my console and I probably won't see it for awhile ""until my grades go up"". Wooo *cursed trumpet sounds*. If you've finally made it here to the end, I mentioned my birthday being today/shortly yesterday. It only made things worse in terms of furthering my existential dread. Everyone was a lot more happy about it than I was. I asked to be left alone for the day, but of course that wouldn't happen because my wants were too much for everyone to meet. ""15 years of life"" while I only see it as "" 15 years of suffering, 2 seconds away from sealing that number eternally"". I know things are gonna get better. But my mind constantly tells me that I need to leave, and leave now. I know it's kinda childish of me but I really didn't handle having my games taken away very maturely. That was one of my biggest escapes from reality but alas, I have that option no longer availble for now. I will continue to paint and listen to music in silence. I've picked up a knife recently and pressed it against my skin with no results. I can't bring myself to do it. That's when I know I wasn't totally lost.

This entire text has been an absolutely wonderful mess, I hope you enjoyed the read. I'm hanging in there, I think.",08Nov2020,1
56,"We were best friends for about 10 years. Never any fights or “drama”. We are both 26. Last year I had my own personal turmoil and I cheated on my partner, who is a mutual friend of ours. It was a bad situation, and my friend took this very personally. 
He shut me out for the better part of the year, but finally reconnected with me in January of 2020. During the time I was not around, my friend started distancing himself from our other friends as well. We had a fairly tight knit group, so I was shocked to find that he had pushed them away as well.
This friend has dealt with depression and body image issues as long as I can remember. When we reconnected he confessed that he planned to commit suicide after paying off his debts so he wouldn’t leave the financial burden for his family. 
This quantity was fairly large, so I figured I had time to help him myself. I had also attempted suicide during the whole cheating fiasco, like I said it was a bad time. I thought this experience might provide some level of understanding because he knew that I know how he feels.
(I went to a doctor, got on meds and did therapy, I’m better.)

Keep in mind now, I was the only one he let back in a little and continued to ignore everyone else even though they all reached out (and even months later, still do). 

Anyway, my friend and I got into an argument over shutting out the other friends, (he was saying some crappy things about our mutual friend) and he admitted that he did not stick by my side through the cheating thing because his family told him that I needed him, and he did not want to be told what to do. Childish, I know. I was hurt at this, and that was the last time I talked to him on the phone. 

I reached out later that day and apologized for the argument and have tried countless times to make amends. He was talking to me once in a while like nothing happened, sending me a text here and there, a photo, a link, whatever. 

Now he completely ignores me, ignores my family (who even though he and I weren’t talking, still maintained a relationship with- he hung out with my nana every weekend with our without me) and ignores every friend I see posting on his social media stuff, regardless of if they are mutual or not. 

The confusing thing is, he still posts, he still gets passionate about politics and bettering the world, but he just ignores everyone. 

I still send him messages like “thinking of you” or a photo that made me smile, little pep talks, and sometimes I ask if we can go for a walk or something (we used to take nature walks all the time). 

He does respond sometimes, but very rarely. And it’s usually, “I can’t, I’m sorry” or “I hope you are well too” and that’s it, so I can tell he cares enough to not block me. 

He’s doing well at work and it’s been almost 10 months since he told me his plan, and I’m very worried that he’s getting close to his goal and I can’t help him in time. I reached out to his mother today and I plan to talk to her tomorrow. I don’t want to betray his trust but I still love this guy, he’s my best friend and always will be, ether he wants me there or not.

I don’t know what to do that isn’t going to embarrass him or institutionalize him. I was hesitant to talk to his family but I can’t pretend that I can help anymore, because I don’t know if I can.",08Nov2020,1
57,"Hey everyone,

Broke up with my long-term boyfriend today because I am in no shape to be in a relationship right now. We are both in therapy for different reasons and I explained to him that I needed to learn to take care of myself before I can be with anyone else. I think my decision was right, but I still care for him a lot and it just hurts so much. I told him not to wait for me; it isn’t fair to keep him waiting (lord knows how long my journey will be). He was understanding but very hurt. I feel awful and saddened that not only am I losing a partner, but also one of my best friends. Do any of you have any tips on recovering from this? I want to still be friends with him, but understand that often that doesn’t work. What should I do?",08Nov2020,1
58,"Ever since the pandemic, I have been really lonely. My classes went online and I had at least some interactions via Zoom and a nice routine going on. But then I graduated in May and the number of interactions with others has plummeted. It's important for me to talk to people because if I don't talk to people enough I start mumbling more and making speaking mistakes. 

I have a boyfriend that I live with, or else I would be far worse off. But we mostly do our own thing and he is busy working long shifts. Also, being around each other all the time has lost its novelty and most of our talking is about mundane things. I sometimes video chat with family and I really look forward to those times, but it's only about once a month or so that I do that. 

Lately I've noticed how much I crave interactions with others. I reach out to family and friends more than I used to, but I don't want to be annoying or come off as desperate. I've started talking to myself and pretending that someone else is saying things back because I have hardly anyone to talk to. I never used to talk to myself ever before, not even when I was a child, and it feels like I'm slowly starting to go crazy sometimes. 

I find myself listening to hours of podcasts and videos just to hear someone else's voice and I talk to my cat as if she were a person, but even if doing that stuff makes me feel less lonely, I also feel like a weirdo for it.",08Nov2020,1

60,"First of all, I know I don’t have any other posts and that’s because every time I post I have to delete it so my girlfriend doesn’t get more worried, but I should be ok to post this. If this is breaking any rules I want the mods to delete it but I don’t think it is. I’m 14 just for some context of this “story”.

I believe I have anxiety, depression, and some other stuff that I don’t know of, but I’ve never gotten diagnosed. I don’t have a therapist and I don’t think I can have one for at least another 4 years. I’m mentally unstable and I have almost killed myself multiple times.

My parents know that I have depression but I’ve basically been told to suck it up so I can’t go to them for help. My girlfriend knows how I feel because I trust her and I tell her how I feel and she tries to help but she can’t. She also has anxiety and depression but she has to walk away when things get bad and then I feel horrible for causing it. I also have zero self-worth and feel like everything bad is my fault and anything good isn’t my doing. 

What I need advise on is how to hide it from my girlfriend and parents. It causes my girlfriend a lot of stress and I don’t want to cause her stress but she knows me too well and it’s hard to hide when I’m having a bad day. I just want to be able to hide when I feel bad and fake being happy to her, how can I do that?

63,"Sorry about formatting or stuff like that, I am really exhausted. I will try to keep this as short and sweet as possible. 

I used to be a stellar student and great pianist. As nerdy as it sounds, I genuinely loved studying and the process of learning in general. Then the major depressive disorder hit. As many of you know, this comes with lack of motivation. I was untreated for more than two years, and in that time I completely lost interest in studying and playing piano. During that time I was frequently berated by teachers and told I would not graduate from high school, or be allowed to play in the recital. I was finally treated, and the vast majority of my symptoms subsided. Three years down the road, I am doing pretty decent mentally. The weird thing is, I still do not have any motivation to study and/or play piano. It's not the complete lack of motivation that came with MDD--I can still do chores and errands without any issue--it is literally those two things. It may not seem like a big deal, but now I am a bad student and I can barely play anything on the piano. To be honest, it really hurts, because being an avid learning and a great musician were two of the largest parts of my identity, and it is very painful to think that I don't have it in my anymore. I understand the consequences of not studying....I just genuinely cannot bring myself to do it.

I'll make my story short. I live in Australia. I was recently diagnosed with severe depression that has prevented me from moving into a 'real' job, hurt my studies and motivation. It led me down a path of alcohol addiction and doing a lot of things I am not proud of. My family are supporting me on my path to recovery and I am planning to return to study. I was recently accepted in an Honours program for a psychology degree. Now that I'm getting treated I want to put my life back together and meet some great people.

I've also never slept with anyone because of this anxiety and fear of judgement. So I am still a virgin.

Hobbies include: Films and TV, heavy metal music, history, working out at the gym, psychology, US politics, art, trying different foods, occasional video games, atheism, writing, bushwalks, most things horror-related.

There are ups sometimes, but I struggle to be consistent. I live with my family and with COVID happening they don’t mind me not working and I take care of the house and dogs. Im am always trying to be better and gain important adult skills on my own. It just seems anytime I make progress my mother notices and has to say something backhanded.

Today I managed to make a proper meal, an omelette and she said “That’s good, you should already be doing these things tho.” If I get visibly upset she will call me weak or say I’m having a pity party. She’s very impatient with me and passive aggressive half the time, but expects me to be patient and at her beck and call whenever she needs tech support or a favor.

I would learn something about history or science or engineering and then I begin to think. It starts with intrigue and turns into morbid obsession. I watched a video about the ocean and then it dawned to me that we have yet to even comprehend the ocean and that this is a literal barrier that we cannot ever explore at least in my life time. 
Then I think about the space and now we are bound to this earth and can’t even make it out of this solar system let alone Jupiter. 2-6 years of continuous travel to a planet we can’t even survive on, or even worse, 10 years of travel to a planet NOTHING can survive on. Just cold dead rock, nothing to be seen. Then it would take 10 years to come back assuming we can even make a trip to the damn planet. It’s another boundary for humans. 
There are things that don’t make sense and will probably always and forever never make sense and ultimately I think about death. But not just my death, the death of everything.
Not even black holes can escape time. Everything has to die, and eventually there will never be a “thing” ever again. An absence of life forever.

Human intelligence is a curse, why were we gifted this curse. I don’t want to die, I am so afraid of the concept of death it’s almost crippling. But at the same time I can’t cheat death. I can’t escape it. Should I just rush the process or try to enjoy my time? It’s not like it would be a life I’d want to live with the severe mental illness that also plague my mind.

Obliviously, I wondered aloud why that may be considering that there’s a residential neighborhood immediately next to the building. She said, while looking down, “it’s because they know what this place is.” And that just hit me like a truck and I almost teared up seeing her face. But the worst part is that she is probably right. These apartments are located in a small, rural town where most (not all) people probably hold on to misinformation, stereotypes, and stigmas against people who experience mental health problems.

And not being able to pronounce words properly. And when I mess up a sentence or get confused, I can’t just start where I stopped, I have to restart the whole sentence. And then I typically mess up a few more times. And so many times tonight my friends had to finish my sentence or something bc I couldn’t. 

Like we were playing Warzone and if I tried to call someone out sometimes I just couldn’t. And normally I can say like “Theres 3 people 270” in a half second. And it was taking seconds to say it now. Like I would go like “There’s 3 pe-“ and I would make like a sigh sound I guess. Like a depressing sigh. Bc I just couldn’t ever finish a sentence. So I started just saying “270” to get it across. And this has been happening for a few weeks now but it was HORRIBLE tonight. And I feel like complete and utter shit. I don’t know why it bothers me so much. 

And I was talking to my teacher about some assignments (just texting on google classroom) and it took so long to read a basic paragraph. And I have to read out loud to comprehend what I’m reading. So my stuttering combined with me having to restart at the beginning of the sentence made it horrible to read. And I have to read outloud as I type and when I stutter I have to restart reading. And I have OCD and sometimes I have to press a key a certain amount of times and typing is already really hard and shit and this is making it worse. 

I don’t know why but it is stressing me out so much and making me so anxious but it is and I just feel like complete shit and this happened hours ago",08Nov2020,1
81,"For the past few weeks I’ve been experiencing an increasing amount of depression due to my life choices, my friends, &amp; my line of work. Recently I got kicked out of my house, where I was living with my best friend, and also now my best friend wants nothing to do with me. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I make things worse when I’m around, I feel bad for people I’ve called friends. I need someone to talk to &amp; with COVID I can’t go see a therapist, at least not where I am in New York.",08Nov2020,1
82,"What do you guys think about family competition and complexes? I’ve a cousin who had gotten into Columbia with a 1450 SAT, while I had a 1440 SAT and decided on pursuing BS/DO despite having a BS/MD acceptance. She just told me that she wants to go to Med school and declared bio as major; now that I think about it, despite having equal levels of intelligence, my degrees can make me feel inferior. I graduated Summa Cum Laude in the BS part. I start DO this summer. I choose DO for a reason; I wanna learn more anatomy and phys and carry on a family legacy and become a surgeon, but sadly this stigma against DOs persists. There is a side in me that says she will brag her Ivy League degree off; she will get into a prestigious med school maybe cuz she is a woman of color, from a low income family. While I am a man of color and from a well-off physician family but with equal levels of intellect. Envy and self-hatred are not easy things to deal with, especially from my culture. Does not having bragging rights suck? Should I see a counselor?",08Nov2020,1
83,"Sometime around last year, I wasn’t having the best time (my official diagnosis was general anxiety, but you’ll see why I didn’t call if that). I would rant about everything to my best friend until she was burnt out. But I used my mood as a crutch. And it kept me from helping myself. Now, I’m so terrified of slipping back. I’m annoyed at the person I was. I’m angry at myself because I lost some important things because I just refused to work. 

I can’t find it in me to empathize with people. I know, I’m a terrible person, but it’s like hearing about other people talking about their struggles triggers something in me, and it reminds me of a time I hated everything, I hate myself for it, and it makes me dislike them. How do I stop myself from doing this??",08Nov2020,1
84,"Hello! I'm 27, female, and I feel like I've been struggling with mental health issues for the majority of my life but my parents never cared enough about me to bring me to a medical professional for anything my entire life aside from two exceptions, when I had a ruptured ear drum and when I had ovarian cysts that were so extreme I was having severe cramping. Now I'm so anxious and guilt ridden I've brushed everything off for years as just being ""a normal thing"" but I've reached an extreme now that I know this can't be normal, or if it is I would rather just kill myself. Every day, constantly, I'm overwhelmed with anxiety or guilt, sometimes its not even accompanied by a mental acknowledgement, just the physical weight of guilt in my chest. Between that and constantly becoming overwhelmed I feel like I take my emotions out on anyone close to me because I don't know what I do, and just want to feel like someone cares even though it's not fair to the person I'm taking it out on and even while I'm attacking them for it I feel the crushing guilt of what I'm doing. I've gotten to the point in my life where I've realized there's something terribly wrong, and I'm very proud of that because I know not everyone reaches that point, but even knowing that I can't win the arguments I have with the voice in my head about what a worthless, unlovable piece of trash I am. I plan to get professional help but money is very tight at the moment, I'm just hoping someone can give me some advice to help me get by in the meantime. Thank you and I'm sorry to bother!",08Nov2020,1
85,"I feel like I'm at a point of  my life where everything is futile and it feels like I'm so game to be reincarnated lest I do die.

Ever since I was betrayed by a good number of people for a mistake I was judged for, ever since my ex gf broke up with me on my birthday last year, ever since I quit my previous company due to arguing everyday with my teammates every goddamn day, ever since this pandemic ruined my plans to fix my physical appearance through boxing (gyms are locked down even as we speak), ever since my appointments with my therapist were unfruitful due to her being paranoid about the virus in the middle of the sessions, and ever since I started smoking weed, life has been very up and down for me and I can only blame myself.

The bad things in my life have casted a shadow on the good things I have, and it has become my comfort zone. I made a short list of them...

The good
1. I have a job I'm not good at but pays well
2. Recently adopted a dog that I really take good care of
3. I have enough to live on my own comfortably
4. I get to sleep better than before

The horrible
1. I have very poor hygiene
2. I smoke a pack of cigarettes a day
3. I set aside a budget for weed because it helps me with my anxiety apart from the anti depressants and anti anxiety medicine (only take weed at night)
4. I'm fatter than I've ever been in my life
5. I'm uglier than I've ever been in my life
6. I have no sex drive whatsoever
7. I spend recklessly, could even save so much if I didn't have the aircon on 12 hours a day or if I knew how to cook
8. All my energy is spent during my shift at work
9. Couldn't save
10. I have 0 genuine friends, the rest are just skin deep or even acquaintances

I'm now essentially a sloth, because I feel like everything I do now would be worthless in the end. For instance, ""what's the point of exercising if you hate it and you don't even want to look good for anybody including myself?"" And it's not like I'm ready to take on more challenges in life. My work and raising my puppy already feel like a handful.

86,"I've never felt suicidal before, now I realise. I'm a high functioning Autist. I feel like I'm going mad, I can no longer sleep, my brain has ceased to allow rest. I feel like the guy from limitless, or Lucy, like my mind is going explode like the big bang times infinity. My mood changes every hour or so. Hateful, then suicidal, then horny, then guilty, anxious, etc. There is no help. There will never be, there was me to help myself, now I have lost control.

I don't want to, I know it's not important I just find myself looking at what I can change. 

I had to take antidepressants and antipsychotics which made me gain 40 pounds in a month, and I feel like my obsession has gotten worse ever since as I'm really tempted to just not eat (but I'm going to I know that won't help).

89,So ever since I was young I’ve lacked a sense of belonging I never had a clear future and I still don’t have a clue of what I want to work towards. Every time I try and do something I used to like or am slightly interested in I get bored as hell and then lonely on top. When I try to advance my life such as college I panic and procrastinate all the time where it makes me want to just not exist. I don’t live for anything or anyone. The only few people who kinda care are my parents but I’m basically a leech. I just am tired I’m always tired and I don’t want to live through it anymore. I can’t even commit to hurting myself anymore I’m too tired for that. I just need a permanent break from being.,08Nov2020,1

91,"Disclaimer: Venting feels good for me. It temporarily releases the emotions I feel.

Sometimes I feel like it’s just me against the world. I have this image planted into my mind that the mistakes I ever make, no matter how big or small will always result in hatred upon myself from everyone. I told myself for a while, “maybe I’m just not likable?” This is definitely it, I’m not likable. I mean, why else would I have no friends, no life outside of work, I’m even allowed to have a gf? Even when I did friends for a bit, whenever I wanted to go out with them it’s always what, why, when, how and who when I ask my parents. No surprise they stopped talked to me. I’m 18, aren’t I too young to be feeling like this? That’s what everyone tells me. I suppose this is started at around 8th grade. I was a target to bullying inside and outside of school. Had rumors made up about me which defined who I was. I even got made fun of for the music I listen to, the hobbies I enjoy, the way I “act” because all the things I liked and was weren’t “manly enough.” 

Some comments I used to get were:

• A guy should be listening to Rap music, not pop

• You should be into cars and sport instead of baking.

• You shouldn’t cry because it makes you look like a baby.

High school changed me! I hide my feelings now, I stopped listening to pop, I act intimidating (even though I don’t want to, it just happens).

Now, this is very important to note: I have never been diagnosed with any illness and I am not self diagnosing myself. 

I’m too afraid to speak up. One time I did, my family started acting like I’m crazy. They blamed themselves, said I was “ungrateful,” “I live in a stable household, stop being crazy.”

.......................................................................................
""We fix it. In fact it is much better than when the lady put on our screen protector because it has bubbles on it but the bubbles, I mean this screen still have some bubbles but at least not as big as earlier but on this part the bubble appear to be bigger but no l, it is not really that bigger, can't be as big as the one on the top right before we fix it but even though it is bigger, at least it isn't really that long I mean this is a little long and bigger but not as long as it was, even though it is bigger. Gotta say we did a better job before we worsen it earlier or in fact even better before we even worsen it... I think it's better than it used to be after the lady screw it up or maybe it's not really that different, maybe she did a better job but we worsen it and make a bigger bubble, we make a bigger bubble accidentally but no, not really accidentally but we worsen it and we make big bubble which worsen it but even though it has bubble, it still not as bad as a crack. we have a crack before and no matter how bright our phone is the crack is still visible but with bubble, at least it is not as noticeable as the crack maybe it will noticeable when we turn off our phone or when the screen became dark which is not really noticeable if it's night or let's say when it's dark but with crack, no matter how bright our phone is it will still noticeable no matter how high our phone brightness is. Now we can watch video better because right now we are using matte screen protector which is much better than tempered glass screen protector i mean, tempered glass screen protector is good and clear but even though it is clear, we can't watch video in comfort except when it is night, when it's dark but even it is night, as long as there is light we can still our face, our reflection on the phone screen when watching video which can make us uncomfortable when watching video because our reflection is on our way, which is why matte screen protector is better because it can prevent reflection, not really prevent it because we can still our reflection on the screen but at least it is blurry and we can only barely see our face on the screen when or when not watching the video, even though or phone is turned off. tempered glass is good and clear but first, it cause fingerprint, I mean matte screen protector can still have fingerprint too but just a little bit and not really noticeable but tempered glass screen protector can make fingerprint noticeable which is not really an issue because we still can clean it anyway right? but tempered glass screen protector doesn't have  anti-glare feature and we can see our face on the screen and it will not be really comfortable especially when watching videos because our reflection is on our way and making us really uncomfortable when watching videos because we want to see the video, not our ugly ass face. second, Tempered glass screen protector might be clear compared to matte screen protector but tempered glass will make it harder to see our phone screen under the sun because it has no uv protection which can also protect our eyes, i mean we can wear eyes protector but it migt be less comfortable but anyway, tempered glass has no uv reflector and make it harder to see the screen under the sunlight but matte screen protector has uv reflector which is make it easier to see the screen under the sunlight but i mean, we can still see our phone screen under the sunlight but we have to adjust the brightness to high. with matte screen protector, we might still have to adjust our phone brightness under the sunlight but at least we don't have to adjust it too much because it has uv reflector and make it easier to see under the sun light.... (now imagine me taking a deep breath) third, like we said earlier tempered glass screen protector is good and clear but it doesn't have anti-glare feature which can prevent our face from being in the way when watching video and not just our face but other reflection too i mean not really a problem if we are in the dark but if there's light, we would see our reflection in the video and be on our way when watching video. matte screen protector has anti glare feature and can prevent us from seeing our reflection when watching video and thus, making us more comfortable when watching video.
but we do a better job fixing our screen protector. imagine if we gave up earlier when we screw up i mean, we might still continue later and get a good result as this one or maybe even better or maybe not better than this one but still good or maybe just the same as this one i mean i don't know tho. but if we give up, we might having a messed up screen protector and can messed up our stress level and anxiety and maybe just maybe we will give up and ended up having a bad screen protector. but i don't think so because we might gonna re doing it again if we give up and that's only if we didn't get too angry and break our screen protector and have more stress, more anxiety. maybe we gonna make a little research first on how to fix it properly or maybe not, maybe we will just doing it again or maybe we will not doing it and give up and have no screen protector and if we give up, we might spend a lot of time without screen protector and that can make us stress or maybe we will get used to it but it is better if we have screen protector i mean, we are lucky to not give up. imagine, if we give up, we might have a bad screen protector and i know we might gonna change our phone anyway but during that period of waiting, we might be really not comfortable when using our phone or maybe we will do when used to it. but not really""

.............................................................................

That's not even all of it. There are parts when I have to readjust my screen protector and trigger another conversation. And some sentences are repeated more than the ones in here.

But of course, I'm not as severe as this all the time. Sometime, the conversations will be much much shorter and I have overcome some of the 'trigger' questions. 

I believe this is part of my OCD. OCD is not something where a person is afraid of germs or a person who love everything to be perfect. It's more like an urge to do something and if you don't, you will be very uncomfortable like you are going crazy. In this case, the reason I have long and repeating conversations with myself is because I have a strong urge to do so. And even if it will not make any sense and repeated so many time, not doing it will make me going crazy so I have to do it. 

I do have other forms of OCD too, and other mental health issues. But I just want to share this one to you people. 

Maybe in the future I will either going crazy for real or kill myself.",08Nov2020,1
95,"***So let me start from December 2019, so I saw this girl while I was out for an evening run. I instantly liked her and I tried to talk to her but she would just give one word answers to my attempts at small talk. This went on for 2-3 days over a week, but then I gave up cuz I thought she wasn't interested. So I don't see her for a few days cuz she wasn't visiting the society cuz she didn't live there, her cousins did.***

***Now let's go forward till December ends, I was jogging, but then I sat down on a bench to rest after a few rounds. So now, she comes to visit and parks her vehicle in the parking area, which is really close to the bench. But now I thought she surely doesn't wanna talk to me so I ignore her leave her alone. But after meeting her cousins, she comes down(it's an apartment complex) and sits on her vehicle which is parked really close to my seat, where I was sitting while resting after another few rounds. So she's sitting there doing I don't know what(prolly waiting for someone), but I was convinced she didn't wanna talk to me so I start jogging again, but after a few rounds I sit down to rest and she's still there. Now I really wanted to try to talk to her again cuz she's really pretty. So I go up to her and start talking random stuff and she seemed quite comfortable talking unlike the previous times, even though I didn't do anything different. So we talk about random stuff till her sister beckons her. She tells me to give her a minute and then went to talk to her sister and came back to talk to me. We talk again about random stuff for a while till her uncle comes down using the elevator. She instantly panics after seeing him and then quietly sneaks away from me without saying anything. So I figured her family doesn't allow her to talk to boys.***

***So after that we exchange greetings every few days till February end, she's always the one saying ""hi"" but she never tries to talk to me, it's just me that tried every time. And whenever I tried to talk, she would always just say ""bye"" and leave without any warning while we're in the middle of talking and I pause. So I thought that I was doing everything so I started ignoring her. So it was easy to ignore her cuz she didn't visit for a long time from February end till halfway March.***

***So now we're at halfway March, there's a party in the society, and I go with my best friend, who is a girl. So me and my friend hang out the whole time but in the middle of the party, the crush also arrived with her family. Now I didn't give the crush any attention, but my friend said the crush was staring at me from time to time during the party. But I still thought the crush only liked the way I treated her and gave her so much attention so I still thought it would be better for me if I ignored her.***

***Now let's go forward to March end, I see her 3-4 times but I still ignore her. She had shifted her house and started living here, in this society, but I didn't know that. Okay, so now she tried different ways to get my attention and then I finally made eye contact and after that she used to greet me regularly from her balcony when I used to walk downstairs, her balcony is in the 1st floor. But she didn't talk cuz she didn't come downstairs.***

***This went on till mid April, when she came downstairs to walk with 2 of her cousin sisters, but she still couldn't talk to me cuz her family used to hang around downstairs, and she just didn't talk to me in front of them. After that, she came downstairs everyday to walk with her cousins, I was a bit cautious so I didn't shower her with attention, but sometimes when she said ""hi"", I said ""hi"" as well, but no one initiated any conversation.***

***So now comes another person in this story, her cousin brother, he's from a whole different family altogether. I thought he didn't want me to talk to the crush just cuz of the way he looks at me when she's around. Now, one day, I'm hanging out with another friend of mine, let's call her Subway, we talk for a while, I tell her that I like the girl who's walking with her cousins(well I knew Subway for a while and I thought I could trust her). So after I told her that, she goes like, ""you're going the wrong way"". Apparently, my friend is also friends with the crush's cousin brother, let's name him, Domino. So after I ask Subway why she said that, she tells me that Domino told her that my crush likes her own cousin brother, who is Domino. So that really messed me up and what I used to see as normal brother sister talk, I started to see that with jealousy, cuz I'm crazy.***

***Now, let's go to mid May, I talk to Subway again and she tells me casually that she told Domino that I like his sister(so she basically betrayed my trust), so now Subway defends herself by saying that he already knew even before she told him cuz the crush used to tell Domino every time I talked to the crush since I started talking.***

***So now, after that, Domino tries to talk me out of liking her, and says that ""the crush"" doesn't do relationships, and if I told her that I liked her, she'll stop talking to me. I'm like, ""I'll tell her that I like her when I feel like it"" and I also told him specifically to not tell the crush that I like her. For a few days from now, the crush tells me that Domino doesn't allow her to talk to me now. So I talk to Domino, to try to clear things, he says that he's cool with it and doesn't have any problem with me liking his cousin, and he also told me that he didn't say anything to her about not talking to me. He also tried to talk me out of liking her again.***

***So now we go to the end of May, so now the crush beckons me from a place where her family can't see her from, and she asks me that Domino told her that I like her, so is that true or?? I'm like, ""when did he say that??"", then she hesitated and tells me, ""A long time ago"", so after that I did tell her that I like her, but she said she can just be friends. So I go like ""okay"" and try to act casual.***

***Now let's just take a moment, she just lied to me by saying, ""a long time ago"", cuz she hesitated and it seems like a hell of a coincidence that she asks me this question just days after her brother got to know about it from me. And after almost a month, the crush also told me that Domino told her about me liking her cuz Domino didn't want me to get hurt. And Domino didn't even know me ""a long time ago"". And trust me on this, Domino just isn't that kind of person.***

***So after the rejection, I just didn't wanna talk to her anymore or her brother or Subway or anyone related to this crush incident. So I just ignore her for 15-20 days. So, now we're at mid June, and she started taking walks all by herself and without her cousins. And just after three days of her taking walks alone, she manages to talk to me, and then says if I could go cycling with her in the mornings. I hesitated but said okay cuz I'm dumb.***

***So she managed to rope me in again, so after the cycling plan, she just bails on me during the last moment. So now I'm really confused, I go up to her and ask her why she didn't come. She actually told me that she isn't coming cuz her friend isn't coming to give her company. So, I go like, ""You told me to come with you, and you aren't coming cuz your friend isn't coming??"". So to that she goes like, ""I'm not able to wake up in the mornings nowadays, and I've had a fever for the last 3 days, and my sister isn't home so I have to do stuff around the house"". So, I decide to leave her alone now for the fourth time lmao.***

***After 3-4 days, I tried to wake up in the mornings and go jogging, and there's the crush already cycling before me. So, she lied. I mean, I'm done so I ignore her for a few mornings until I go crazy again and forget how talking to her is bad for me, and I start talking again. So she comes downstairs for cycling everyday and she told me one day that she goes with her sisters, which is true. Now, after a few days, she just starts cycling around in the society cuz her sisters aren't coming anymore. Now I got it, she bailed on me cuz her sisters were coming, and sisters might tell her parents. Trust me, she got a lot of sisters. So after her sisters stopped coming, she went cycling around the society alone and sometimes secretly with Domino(I say secretly cuz her parents are soo weird that they don't let her talk to her cousin brother). It hurt me that I wasn't an option but I didn't pay any attention to it. So we never talked in the mornings but we talked occasionally in the evenings. So now she gets to know a little bit about me cuz I was always the one asking questions before. So, one evening, we're talking, and my mom calls me from upstairs and told me to bring a few things kept in the car. So, I ask her if she'll still be here walking, and she says yes, and then I tell her I'll be back in 2 minutes.***

***After I'm back, I look around for her and I see her talking to Domino, who was watching us talk before, so after she talks to him, she goes upstairs, gets her vehicle key, and they both go somewhere, I don't know where. And the thing is like she never felt the need to explain to me what happened all of a sudden. I specifically told her I'll be back, just wait for a couple minutes. I feel like I'm the last option for her when everyone's out of her life and she just wants someone to stick with her. And I also feel like she didn't explain cuz she thought I would still be there to give her attention no matter what. After that her classes started and we didn't talk to each other for a long time. I kinda got time and I just thought I won't talk to her anymore.***

***So now it's been 3 months and I haven't talked to her but she's still on my mind sometimes and just hurting me quite a bit but not as much as before. To be honest, I can take a bit of hurt, I don't mind but now I had clearly shown her and like literally given her hints that I don't wanna talk anymore. And this time I feel like I'm quite done but my mind is really messed up so I don't know how I'll feel later.***

***A few days ago, this November, she started coming down sometimes, not for walking, just for errands, even though I clearly gave her the hint that I didn't wanna talk, she still tries to say ""hi"". I mean I'm so frustrated about why she just can't get out of my life cuz all she does in my life is create confusion, might not be her fault but still, It can't hurt her to stay away from me, right?***

***Yeah so this thing right now in November, where she's trying to get my attention, this messed me up again cuz I want her to come downstairs but I wanna ignore her as well. Like it's not like I want attention, trust me, I don't. I'm just really confused with myself. Hope any of you have advice on how to deal with it when she tries to talk.... Please***",08Nov2020,1

I’m sad that I’ve got to this point of my life. My panic attacks are getting worse , I have no hope left anymore. My procrastination is getting even worse now because mind has set into thinking that there’s nothing that’s worth anything and besides I may pass away in a week . I want to stop my procrastination but it’s gone out of my control nowadays . I did try to take my life 2 months ago but the blade wasn’t sharp enough to kill me . I survived but my parents still don’t take it seriously, they assume I’m acting to get attention. I’m so low of energy because of the panic attacks which I’ve had due to the coming exams . If you’re a therapist or if you have experience with learning bout psychology , please tell me how to stop this .",08Nov2020,1

What if they get me a skirt, and call me by my preffered name? And this cant be healthy, because whenever I daydream about this, I either get really excited when about to speak my parents, and have my excitement crushed, or I get really sad afterwards realising that it probably wont happen.

Another thing, I'm forgetting the smallest task. Earlier I was doing something, and I had the slightest freak out because I wasn't sure if I showered today or not. I just couldn't remember for whatever reason?? Like my memory is starting to blank out on me. My mom will tell me to do something, and sometimes I'll daze out, and forget completely what I was doing. That's just a fraction of what I've been forgetting, today I thought we were still in October. and get this, I was thinking to myself ""Its october... 8th, so halloween is soon"".... what the actual fuck is happening to me?

100,"Don’t get me wrong, I understand why they have them. If someone were to react badly to something a volunteer said it would be devastating for everyone involved. But am I the only one that thinks the scripts come off really patronising? The times I’ve called a hotline I’ve always come away feeling far worse. When you’re seeking genuine advice, feel alone and have nobody to talk too having the hotline person come back with “ok you say everyone hates you and you have nobody to speak too, how does that make you feel?” It makes you feel like a number, it makes the person on the other end seem completely un-empathetic and like they don’t care. 

Would it not make sense to train them to respond in a certain way but allow them the freedom to divert from a script? 

When you feel like ending things and feel like nobody cares about your feelings all you need is to feel like someone’s actually listening to you, I’d honestly prefer if they stayed silent and just let you vent rather than the bullshit “how does that make you feel bullshit” like it makes me feel like I want to die Linda what do you mean",08Nov2020,1
101,"A while ago, closer to the start of this year, my girlfriend of now over a year had a guy from her work kiss her. This was obviously hard to get over, but I managed, and we both moved on. Recently however, the guy that did it has been causing more issues. This caused my girlfriend last night to message me saying that it was her that kissed him, and there was some touching. This crushed me. Way early in the relationship, we had a big fight and she asked why I didn’t dump her then, and I said that I would only ever dump her if she lied about something major or cheated. Well now I’d found out she did both (to a degree). I barely got myself out of bed this morning, and I got through the day with some small hiccups, until around 9. My cat (1-2 years) comes inside with lots of blood and a clearly damaged eye. We called the after hours vet and took him down, and it’s a 50/50 on whether or not he’d keep his eye. He should be coming home tomorrow and later this week we’ll be going back for more treatment. I also might be seeing my girlfriend just so we can talk it out and hug and cry.

103,"I’m 17F and I can hardly remember anything before age 12, minus a few things. When I was little, maybe 7/8 I really don’t know, I remember one time in the car on the way home from school telling my mom that suddenly all my past memories felt very blurry. And I mean like, I could only recall a few key memories, which strangely enough weren’t even “important” events—like wearing a certain pair of boots to school or my teacher’s face. There seems to be a window of time where I don’t remember anything: about 8-12? Im really not sure.
I’ve read that trauma may affect memory but I don’t know if thats possible for me. I couldn’t say yes or no because, well, I don’t remember. 
However there are aspects of my personality that show that *could* be signs, but I really don’t want to read too much into them. 
I often have the (admittedly selfish) need to make people “rescue” me or empathise or feel bad for me. I’m extremely self conscious of my body and a low self esteem, I have an (undiagnosed) eating disorder and get anxiety around ALL men. These could be related to other things in my life, like my sister reaching her peak in epilepsy (up to 300 seizures an day, nearly dying) when i was 13 and seeing her have seizures and even kick me mid-seizure (shes an athlete) and her go to the hospital (but i never got to see her there). I was also “sexually assaulted” when i was 13 ish by a man slow driving past me with his dong out and touching himself. And on my 17th birthday, july this year, I witnessed a 14 year old girl get hit by a train (I didnt see it but I heard it, and her mother screaming). I have never been to therapy properly, I saw someone 3 times after the train incident but my parents convinced me I was being dramatic so I stopped going.
I don’t want to read into things. I’m not one to self diagnose or anything (minus the ed, because i KNOW i have one its pretty easy to tell). But I also don’t want to leave any possible trauma untouched, if i do have some. 
Is there any advice/help anyone could give me? Is it possible I’m repressing something? Am I reading too much into it? Thanks!",08Nov2020,1
104,"Hi there, this is my first time posting anything on reddit, but right now I just don't know what to do and I don't want to annoy my friends more. Also english isn't my native language, so please forgive any mistakes I make. Also sorry if my text is inconsitent, my head is a mess right now anf thinking isn't that easy. I have some serious mental helath issuses since I can remember. I visit a psychologist but I don't have a diagnosis yet.

So Uni just startet this week for me but I'm already totally stressed out. I'm shivering and shaking and my head is like a caroussel telling me I wont be able to do anything. I'm in my 3rd semester, will be turning 20 next week and have only been at the university once, since my 2nd semester I have to study online thanks to Covid-19. I don't know if these two are realated since I also often had problems going to school. I always were a very good student so i did not have to do any work for school at home. But nevertheless I was ""ill"" very often. Espacially on mondays I often felt super ill and tired in the mornig so I could stay home and relax, but as soon as my mother, father and siblings left for work, I felt amazing and just had a nice day off. My parents often told me they didn't like how much I was simmulating, but never questioned me when I told them I wasn't feeling well. They also now about my mental history and try to look after me when I'm not in a good place.Last semester was bad for me. I spend days just laying in bed and crying. I ended up only doing one course out of five. I need a lot of time for myself, but I still life at home and thanks to Covid everyone was here. It was horrible. (Now only my father works from home, my mother and siblings still work and go to school normally). As soon at it was possible I left to visit a friend who lifes in an other country and stayed there for some time. It was so much better there, but I can't go and visit him now until January. After I came home I had my semester break (3 months for me) and since I decided not to write any exams I just had time for myself. This was great, I visited friends who life a bit further away and the whole last month I just keep baking christmas cookies. I honestly love baking so much. It destresses me and helps me to clear my mind. I would love to work in this field, but the pay is so horrible and I'm scared that it won't be destressing then anymore.But now with the start of the semester it all just starts boiling up again. This week I only have to do one worksheet (will be four in the future) but I'm already incapable of doing so. I have great friends who work together with me and would take me through the whole semester without asking for anything in return, but I don't want to be such a burden. It feels horrible. It also makes talking to my friends about my mental state so difficult because I just feel like the only thing I do is complaining. I don't want to complain all the time but it is so difficult when your mind is hurting you all the time.

I have the feeling I just have no chance of living a normal life ever in my life. How could I work if the tiniest amount of stress just knocks me out  completely. How can I finish my degree if just thinking about doing the work for university makes me a crying mess? I don't know what to do with my life. Everything seems so pointless.",08Nov2020,1

Am I trying to satisfy one insecurity at the risk of the others?

It's almost been a month and I'm so ashamed and guilty of what I did, it feeds back into my aversion of them and now I'm all the more afraid to send a message. I just feel like I've complained too much and didn't do enough to get better. I feel like they feel betrayed and/or abandoned by me.

I miss them so much.

106,"I (24F) feel like no really cares.


I’ve recently been diagnosed with depression. I’m in therapy, but I don’t know if it’s working. I’m trying to take care of myself. I eat, I exercise, I’m doing well at work. I’ve been blessed with moving into a lovely house. 

I’ve had a difficult relationship with my family my whole life. My mother is emotionally manipulative and verbally abusive. I know that deep down she cares and that she is how she is because of her own unresolved trauma, but I cannot have a close relationship with her because I cannot cope with the constant yelling.

My father lives abroad with his new family and although his words sometime say that he wants me involved in his new life, his actions very clearly say otherwise. If I don’t prescribe to the exact way he wants me to behave, think, speak and feel, then he hangs up the phone and we don’t speak for months.

My younger brothers and I grew up in a pretty toxic environment. Our parents would constantly argue (I’m talking yelling for 6 hours straight everyday or post yell silence) and they would sometimes put a lot of blame of their relationship on us. I was asked to choose repeatedly between the two from the age of 6 or 7. We also knew in detail, about our family’s financial trouble and my father would tell us about what to do if the bailiffs came at any time. My brothers and I didn’t know how to cope, some of us rebelled and some of us became super introverted to just try not to rock the boat. As a result, we arnet really close.

I have a sort of ex boyfriend. We were happy whilst we were together, and he was my single lifeline of support whilst everything in my life fell apart. He knows me better than anyone but he really lacks empathy so can sometimes make me feel a lot worse when I turn to him. He recently decided that he needed to be single to work through his own issues, but we are still friends, still enjoy each other’s company, still say ‘I love you’ and are exclusive. But I’m well aware that he doesn’t want to be in a relationship and we will drift apart when I stop reaching out. I guess I haven’t been able to let go yet because I’m scared that if I do then I really will have no one. 

I have some friends, 3 of whom I live with, but I’m not important to anyone. Everyone is, quite understandably, dealing with their own priorities in their own lives, and I would never be as entitled as to expect to be anyone else’s priority. I still speak to people from time to time, but I feel as though we are just friends of convenience, so that both parties have someone to do activities with rather than a true connection.

I just feel alone and unloved and lost. I can’t work out if I’m being selfish in thinking this way or maybe codependent. All I feel is that I don’t really matter.  People would notice if I was gone, but it wouldn’t really bother anyone.

Fast forward 5 months later and he remains convinced that people are after him for a variety of reasons. 

It's gotten so bad he obsessively stalks the old coworkers account and said person's friends' accounts on social media and even freaked out back in October when he saw someone who looks like one of those coworker's friends at his apartment complex, and he remained convinced that it was the guy setting his friend up to stalk him.

I've tried telling him if he really upset the dude the guy would've definitely done something by now, and how considering it's been a month since he thought the guy was stalking him, something would've also happened by now in that regards.


It's tearing his life apart and he's becoming borderline suicidal.

I woke up really late today and then went back to sleep at around 13:30. (Its 17:30 atm) 

And thats when this thing started. My dreams started visibly changing, and my conscious brain was comprehending the changes. My dream self pointed it out to some random strangers in my bed, and they convinced me that I forgot because I was drunk as hell. (I am rather untrusting towards people, so the fact that there was more than one stranger in my bed was very weird to me)

Anyhow, what do you know, the dream changed again. And then again. And then again. Every time, somebody convinced me that this was the time that I’m awake. 
I woke up a couple of time, thinking this was the time that I’m actually awake in reality time, but it ends up being another dream. 

And finally, my dream self was sitting with my sister (whom I barely talk to anymore) in my home town (where I haven’t been able go to because of work and COVID). 
I ask my sister “do you think this is a dream?” 
She says “no, you’ve been in town for over a month” she says this very sarcastically, so I asked her “for real”
And she replies with, “if you find yourself wondering if this is a dream, could it possibly be reality?”

And within a span of 30 seconds, I wondered why me and my sisters haven’t fought, how i could get such a long leave from work and why I wouldn’t call my friends if I were in town. Just like that, my eyes snapped open and I was awake.

124," Hi so I've been dating a girl for about 6 months now and known her around 8, she lives in Canada and I'm from the UK so we've never actually met but we have planned on meeting and i care about her and love her a lot. Our relationship started off with her being very toxic and manipulative with me for many months while at the same time being really open and honest to me with her past and her trauma. I 'put up' with it and carried things on with her even though i know she wasn't treating me the best because i just thought it was like sort of a defense mechanism to not let anyone too close. I wont lie my depression and my mental health has gotten a lot worse since I've been with her, especially from the start of the relationship where she was abusive to me. Anyway we've always like broken things off very often and one of us always ends up coming back to the other. One night when we had been broken up for about a week or so (this was while she was still an extremely toxic partner and somehow things after this in our relationship did get a lot better) my friends asked me to go out to a pub with them, since it had been my 18th birthday a couple days before that. I stupidly fell into the peer pressure of it because i was really depressed at that time and i just wanted to escape what i was feeling, this was wrong of me because she was raped while heavily intoxicated when she was 15 (shes 17 now and im of course 18). I know this was extremely careless and unthoughtful of me but it didn't even cross my mind at the time because of how i felt. Even worse while i was out and drunk i gave my friend my phone and he contacted her and after she responded i also messaged her for a while and i was clearly drunk. It was just very immature of me and it was wrong of me, she is the first girl ive ever been with and the only person ive ever felt really truly close and connected to in my entire life, since ive met her i just wanted to be a better person for her and help her because she deservers better than how she has been treat in the past. A few days later she got in contact with me again and we basically started dating again, this was about 3 months ago now and over this time we became closer than we've ever been before and she told me how i make her want to live and happy and she 'felt like she never loved anyone before because of the way she loves me' But like whenever something minor happened in our relationship, whichever one of us caused it she keeps bringing this up and she cant seem to get over it when shes angry, sometimes it just comes out of nowhere and she just dislikes me and tells me we can never be happy together and shes leave me, shes gonna go out with a guy to get back at me, etc just basically saying our relationship is hopeless. Ive always let my emotions get to me when we argue and i say alot of stupid stuff and basically dont support her the way i should ive been trying my best to stay maintained recently and im getting better. This may sound wrong and disgusting of me but i dont know if its me or if its her BPD or a combination. Because after this, whether it minuets, hours or the next day she just messages me like nothing ever happened. She isnt as loving as she used to be and is definitely more distant but she just acts like nothings wrong, and i cant mention anything because i dont want to set her off again, i couldn't ever leave her because she's way too important to me shes literally my whole life and id do anything for her and i promised her id never leave her, she even told me one day shes sorry for how she acts when shes upset and she'll always be back to me no matter what, and sometimes when we fall out and remove eachother she apologizes to me and says shes sorry for pushing me away and causing me to do what i did. I just have no idea how she truely feels about me and if she actually wants to try and make it work with me or not. When shes ok she says she does care and she loves me and wants to be with me but when shes angry/upset which is basically like everyday now randomly or when she gets upset from something else she turns it onto me and tells me she doesnt care about our relationship anymore its never gonna work, generally just insults me alot which i try not to take to heart but it still affects me of course. I dont know how she really feels, i dont know if she just comes back to me because she has nobody else or she genuinely cares. I dont know if our relationship ever has a chance of getting better but im so emotionally attached to her and shes all i have i cant function without her. Her parents, specifically her mother is really abusive mentally and not good for her at all and has her own mental health problems, and her father is present but very distant and she says she doesnt feel loved by him at all. She says she has the best psychologist/therapist or whatever in her state but i dont recall her ever going while shes been with me or trying to get help. I just feel trapped and helpless, i know i could never leave her and we both just hurt so much being together and its just and endless cycle of us falling out then making up again, im so mentally exhausted but i feel i need to be there for her as she really has nobody else shes close to. I cant tell her to get help without triggering her again and seeming like im saying shes the problem because its not her fault, we've both made mistakes and hurt eachother in our relationship and im not even sure if my mistake is the biggest cause of our troubles or if shes just using it against me like this. Shes also upset that ive not done enough for her to make her feel loved, I know i havent done enough for her, ive tried my best but ive just let my depression and paranoia of our relationship just failing and crumbling from pushing me to do stuff really special for her. I want to be better for her and i know i will be but like she now says its too late and she doesnt care anymore while shes upset but like i said acts like everythings ok when she isnt. I dont know i know everyones different but i just need somebodys insight into this and just someone to talk to if someone could try to help me please, thankyou.",08Nov2020,1

I’m 24 and I’ve been out of high school for years now. So the movie ends and I tell my girlfriend that I’m about to head home. She wakes up but I went ahead and told her that I didn’t want to leave until we had everything worked out. 

So we got to talking and she told me that I’m always so passive aggressive and that I take things so personal when older versions of me are brought up. We get deeper into our little argument and it went full circle back to the fucking movie. 

Then it happens *shattered glass sound effect*. I told her about how much I hate thinking about how I used to be. This stupid idiot who spent all his years in high school fucking around and wasting time. If you were to ask anyone who knew me from high school they’d say I was either always Fucked up or getting into trouble doing dumb shit. 

I’ve changed a lot in the past 4.5 years. I really have. I lost touch with my old crowd. I found work that really speaks to me and is meaningful. I’m nothing like how I used to be and I cringe whenever I think back to who I used to be. I felt like whenever high school is brought up I get some winter soldier flashbacks and I digress.

I know that most of what I did back then was just me acting out because of how things were at home. Bad influences, no one to really point me in the right direction, I was unmotivated and I was just lost. I’ve suppressed a lot of those memories in order to try and be the man I am today. 

I’m proud of who I am now. I’ve made so much progress when comparing myself to who I used to be but after that while argument I felt like all of that went out the window. Now suddenly I felt like I was going through some identity crisis. I cried in anger about how useless I used to be. I was upset at my parents for really being there for me, upset with my brother for steering me in the wrong direction my whole life, again mad at myself for all the shit decisions I’ve ever made in life. At this point I only felt self hatred for myself. 

A deep sense of emptiness and despair. As the mental break down continued I kept crying about how I felt like who I am now is just some facade. Just some act while the old me is still there somewhere fucking things up. I’m scared that I don’t know what I’m doing. In a few months my parents are going to be leaving the US for good(bc they’re retiring and going back to their home country), my parents also expect that I make sure that my older brother stays out of trouble (he’s been doing a whole lot better too compared to who he was like when I was in high school but again we’ve had some nasty fights in the past), but on top of that ima need to survive on my own. With no where to fall back in case shit hits the wall. 

I had my brain blast moment and I realized that I needed to see a therapist. I apologized to my girlfriend for the unnecessary passive aggression. She was understanding of everything and supported the idea of seeking out a therapist. 

I need to talk these things out with someone who isn’t my girlfriend. I feel like there’s a lot to unbox what has been bottled up for years.

Well that’s really it. I’m sorry if none of this really makes any sense. I guess what’s important is that I’m writing this out and sharing it. Again thank you for taking the time to read this if you did.

Bless.",08Nov2020,1
128,"Hi,

As the title says I am suffering from extreme blushing in literally every social situation. This makes me feel very uncomfortable and embarrased. It's been really destroying my mental health for 1 or 2 years now. Also the thought of going to blush in a situation is constantly on my mind, which gives me a constant feeling of anxiety.

Any advice on how to handle this are much appreciated.",08Nov2020,1
129,"Hey, I guess I'm here because I have no idea where else to go or whom to address.

I'm an 20y old male alcoholic and I feel like absolutely no one in my social circle cares about my drinking problem because they don't consider it bad enough.

I don't want to waste my life away getting drunk, hungover, sober for a week and relapsing into a blackout oblivion. I know I can do so much more with myself, I just need help and I have no idea who to ask that will not laugh at my face or tell me I'm being dramatic.

If I have one drink there is no way I'm not getting absolutely wasted. I don't really crave that bad, it's just that people offer me drinks, I end up having one thinking ""Why not, it's just one"" and then it's a dive in the spiral. 

Please if you have an answer or an element of answer, I ask you to take the time to give it to me.

I don't have time to think about my mental health but I can feel it deteriorating. And I have no idea how to help myself. Everyday I feel like a robot, doing school work and studying. I don't do anything that I find remotely enjoyable because I frankly have no time. So everyday It's the same thing, over and over again. Listening to my teachers giving petty remarks about how if we don't finish this we won't have a nice grade. How can I worry about school when it is adding to my stress? But I still worry, waking up with anxiety attacks. I feel so lonely, no matter how much people are around me. I feel like I am the only person in the universe, struggling to help myself.

134,"My Dad had been fighting cancer for a couple of years and had been going downhill recently. He was admitted to hospital several weeks ago and, due to COVID restrictions, only one person could visit him a day. 

I have severe  anxiety about going into new places, that is manageable when I’m with my boyfriend, but when I’m by myself.... I just cannot cope. The thought of going to the hospital and having to navigate it myself was far too much. 

My dad got moved to a hospice last Thursday for palliative care. 2 people could now visit at a time! But we were so busy with work.... I had planned on going to visit on the Monday but we received a phone call Sunday evening saying he was now unconscious and likely wouldn’t wake up. Immediately, we rushed u but he more than likely had no idea we were there.... he passed away on Wednesday. 

If I had gone to the hospital I would’ve been able to tel him one last time that I loved him. Due to COVID I haven’t hugged this man since February, as even when the restrictions were slackened I didn’t want to risk passing anything onto a shielding person. If I had went to the hospital I could have wrapped my arms around him one last time.

my birthday is a reminder of my age and the time to compare myself to others my age. i turned 23 yesterday and i have nothing to show for it. i was a good student even with my undiagnosed untreated adhd, until i was forced to drop out because after a failing to take my life i became homeless and couldnt attend school while i was stuck in the mental hospital (where i got abused by medical staff and discharged early even tho my doctors boss said on the same day that
i shouldnt under any circumstances) since then ive done nothing so scratch having any career if even a job at this point because theres nothing i can say when they ask me why theres a 7+ year gap since my first graduation. ive never had a real date or bf, ive online distance dated but every single relationship i was in was mentally abusive and i mean that like seriously. not oh there was some drama, i mean my bf would call me and tell me im not allowed to see my friends and then ask me to do mature things on skype for him instead or he'll take his life all while degrading me.                             
                                   
my living situation is horrible. im lucky to have a roof  over my head, yes, but im sharing it with carpet beetles and various types of moths. i have to carefully check everything i use or eat before using it. im scared of bugs  and theyre actively destroying the stuff i own. my landlords goal is to put me in debt. i have a mold problem that i found out from neighbors has been a problem years before i moved in. my depression nest isnt helping but being unmedicated with adhd living alone with no help i just dont even know how to start. most of my things are still in their moving boxes from when i moved in.                            
                         
i have basically no friends. i have a long distance friend but its not the same. i reconnected with old irl friends but all of them lost interest in me quickly and wouldnt reply to me anymore let alone spend time with me. i tried asking for help just for the social workers assigned to me proving over and over that they dont give a shit. for the sake of keeping this as short as possible cause its already so damn long and this isnt even half of it, basically they dont listen, gaslight me, dont help when i ask for it and are transphobic towards me.

im sure if anyone even bothered reading this far they think the same way or at the very least are repulsed by me now. im not trying to excuse to my looks cause theres no point but no its not cause i eat 50k calories a day i actually struggle with eating anything at all. my mom has been putting me on strict diets since i can remember often allowing only one small meal a day while degrading me while i consume it. ofc i struggle with eating any food now im repulsed by it. my low self esteem makes working out hard even though ive always loved it. knowing how people think when they see me walking outside doesnt exactly give me the courage to go work out.

i asked my therapist that and she said indeed why bother doing anything. what do you live for and idk. theres nothing. i cant find a reason to live. im closer to being homeless again and in debt than i am to catching a break let alone being happy. my life has been a constant sob story and every year around the holidays i self sooth saying that oh it cant all be bad right. it cant all be so horrible every year right im sure this year will be different but it never is. not a single year or even week has been good in my life. it always gets worse my existence is under constant threat one way or another and im just so tired.

136,"You can ignore this ugly/toxic rant of mine. 

So, I'm a college dropout with anxiety and mild depression. I live with my parents. Unemployed. Currently I've enrolled myself in college again. And I want to take up content writing classes. The problem here is not money (I have saved up some), it's my mom. I'm so scared to tell about it. She doesn't say things like, don't do it or it's not good for you. She kinda taunts me. She'd say, don't simply waste your money or will you be able to do it? Or why don't you try taking some other class that this so-so's kid is doing?

I'm really quite and anti-social. I get occasional mild panic attacks. I tried therapy last year. Helped me a lot but my fam are not really a fan of therapy or counseling. They're not allowing me to begin my therapy again.

I have always been like this :scared to tell my family what I wanted to learn or do. Last week I wanted to buy a bicycle for myself. I see on my Instagram that almost everyone has a bicycle and post pictures. I told my mom that I'm thinking of buying one. She goes on to say, ""why you want a bicycle? Where will you go with it? Will you be able to ride it? What if you fall?"" (the last question was in reference to me falling with my scooter. I've been riding my scooter for more than 5 years and this year within a couple of months I fell twice. Didn't brake a single bone. I'm just saying)

She then proceeds to say that I never said no. At this point I can't deal with her bs anymore. I rarely go out. Rarely. I have just one best friend whom I meet occasionally. I don't go to the supermarket anymore. And if I tell her I'm meeting my friend after 2 weeks just to get my stuff and hang out, she goes on to say that why do I have to keep going out and went on to say that none of our neighbors kids are going out. A) I know the neighbors kids and they're are definitely going out. Just cause you can't see them going out doesn't mean that they're not. And B) The other neighbors are just a bunch of old hags. Where do you expect them to go anyways?

Me and my only friend want to join the gym. She is kinda fat while I'm kinda skinny. So, I suggested her that we should go together. It will be fun and we can release all our frustrations on the workouts. So, now as I said before she doesn't say no to anything I tell her. She only throws questions which offend me. I'm a softy okay. I cry very easily and I hate yelling (recently I've been doing just that. There's so much of anger and range inside me.) What's worse is that she didn't ask me where exactly the gym is? Or what time we're going? Or is it clean? Or are they following all the safety protocols? Nothing. I didn't get an opportunity to tell her about it too cause she didn't leave any room for a good healthy discussion.

137,"I (23F) have chronic depression and anxiety issues and recently I’ve been quite bad. My Mum (who I was very close to) died 3 months ago and I’m also struggling with an eating disorder. 

I’m working full time in a manual labour job that I’m soooo tired from. I’m also trying to apply for graduate schemes and work experience (it’s really time consuming and I’m feeling stressed about deadlines). My house is disgusting and I’ve not spoken to my friends in weeks.

Basically I’m feeling incredibly overwhelmed right now.

My sister got a call from school saying that a classmate has COVID and she has to self isolate for two weeks. 

It felt like a ‘get out of jail free’ card for me. All I had to do was tell my work this, and lie and say she has a temperature, and I could get two weeks off. Two weeks to sleep, clean, get my life in order, apply for things, and just generally lessen some stress in my life. 

I told my Dad this and he said it was lying, and immoral. He made me feel like I was a bad person and I’m not considering my coworkers. I just need to schedule my time better. In his words, I should ‘suck it up and stop being lazy after work’. 

I know that his reaction was insensitive. But I think he might have a point, that it’s wrong to lie to get time off work. I do feel guilty for doing it. But I am struggling a lot and I think that two weeks off might help.

im new on here but i thought this was a perfect place to ask for help.

recently i started getting a hard time sleeping sometimes laying eye wide open for 2 hours before finally falling a sleep. i don't use any drugs except sometimes smoke some weed but that really helps me with sleeping so its not a drug related thing.  it can take between 1 to 3 hours for me to fall asleep for the last couple of weeks but now im getting really concerned since i haven't slept for 3 days in a row and im starting to feel real bad. im scared to tell my mom because she can overreact sometimes.

can you guys tell me why this happens and does it happend to any of you guys?

This year after 2 surgeries I pushed myself too much and have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. With Victoria Australia being in such harsh lock down I haven’t been able to get the right help. Been to the hospital so many times but my psychiatrist doesn’t listen to me and tells me is something it’s not he hasn’t even seen the medical scans.

Said he‘s doing it as part of his recovery but he still can‘t meet with me alone his new girl has to be with him or he‘ll lie. Eventhough i didn‘t expect much from him it still really hurt. At least my last ferlings for him are completely gone, now there‘s just hate and rage and anger when i think of him. It still hurts like hell and i still wish things were different but they aren‘t. Once again he tried to spin it like it‘s my fault and that i‘m the crazy one since i called him a lot the past few months. Well excuse me when i think you‘re trying to kill urself and don‘t text or pick up. Once again he tried to mailnipulate me and tell me that i‘m overreacting and way to fired up so that we can talk. Saying i‘m emotionally unstable and that i should get help. Well jokes on you i am getting help and my therapist says i‘m completely fine in how i react and thta from my stories he‘s the one who needs help. Idk why i‘m so still trying to rationalize all this. I did nothing wrong and was a good gf. I didn‘t cheat and lie. I did not say i never loved you. Who does that?! I‘m just so angry that i wasted all this time on someone who never really cared about me in the first place. Who was just with me bc he didn‘t want to break up bc he didn‘t want confrontation. I hate all this, i want all the time and energy and love i gave him back. I hate him so much right now. I really hope i‘ll never see him again. And i hope karma and everything bad hits him at some point. I mean it looks like karma hit him already even tho he doesn‘t see it. Idk i‘m just so angry and sad at the same time. This really was the last straw, he once again showed who he really is. He once again showed me that i really just wasted my time. Oh and he said that if i text him again he will post it with my name blurred out. Who does that? How old are you? Should i also post all the things you said to me? All the things you did to me?! No bc i‘m not a child. Ugh i just hate him so much. I want everything back and i just want to forget he ever existed. I want all the bad stuff to hit him. Fuck am i a bad person for wishing that?

So before i end my life, am curious if something good might happen to me if i talk to my friends what's happening to me. Due to depression and stress, i do now have memory loss. And am no longer sure why am sad nor depressed. I recently discovered Bipolar Disorder which is relatable to my behaviour and am thinking if i have that kind of disorder. 

I don't wanna consult a doctor due to my hate to my family's money. I really hate when they say ""We have no money left"". It makes me feel really a burden and i understand that. 

How do i approach or tell my friend what's happening to me? How do i start? All i can think to say is I'm close to ending my life, i don't want them to pity me. I always cheer myself and someday it won't no longer be enough to keep me going. Am just hoping for something.",08Nov2020,1
144,"I am 25 years old and feel utterly hopeless. This year, every single thing has gone to shit. The only good thing I have in my life right now are my closest friends, whom I love and cherish dearly. I graduated college, speak three languages, am very hardworking, and still can't find a job. I am stuck with my parents, who live in a rural village and can't stand the sight of each other. Mom is depressed and won't get help. I feel burdened, barely sleep and spend my days lying around because I barely have any energy left. I can't even make myself work out anymore, despite loving it.

I just don't know. I know I really need to go to therapy, but I have no sources of income so no money, plus most affordable therapists in my area offer online sessions, which sucks when you live where I do and the internet is so bad it takes 2 minutes to load one photo.

And I know that thinking negatively only creates more negative energy and nothing good ever comes from it. But it's getting harder and harder to stay positive.

145,"Hai everyone: i don't know if people can relate to this, but im slowly becoming more aware of this issue and how it's actually damaging my mental health. 

Due to my general health and complete lack of appetite (and ability to taste), i only eat at dinner: i often have to force myself to cook and i've tried tons of different things to make eating more pleasing but to no avail. 

One thing that drives me to eat though it's youtube: knowing that i'll have a screen in front of me and i'll be able to watch whatever i want makes eating more of a pleasing experience. 

The thing is, even watching videos, which is pratically what gives me enough willpower to cook dinner in the first place, is becoming a stressful experience. 

I'll constantly shuffle through all of my videos in the ""watch later"" playlist, watching one for about 20 seconds, realizing that ""it's not worth watching"" and then switch to another one; watch that for another 20 seconds, get upset that it's not ""not worth watching"" and change to yet another one. 

When i manage to settle on one video, i realize that maybe it was ""too long"" and that by being long, it has completely ruined my dinner experience because i could have watched way, way more videos in the same amount of time. 

I finish dinner and im basically overwhelmed by a sense of complete failure. 

This is ruining my main reason for cooking dinner (and eating in general) and i don't know what to do. 

I don't know if anyone can relate, or if there's something i can do about it, but im just putting it out there, hoping that someone will understand even if it probably sounds extremely petty.",08Nov2020,1

A couple of months ago I overcome a depression and didn’t realize what it was until the end of it, when I went to the doctor for another issue. We talked about how I were doing and I opened up about some of my mental issues.
Fast forward 2 months, I am a lot better and it kinda feels like I got my emotions back. Yay
Only problem is 2 months ago, depression ended my relationship with my gf and now I got all my feelings back. 
Talked to her and she says she has already moved on and started dating again.

I’m absolutely terrified of falling back into depression because of this. I’m trying to exercise and count calories to lose weight. Everything I do is to keep me busy from laying in bed all day.
Does anyone have advice for new activities I can engage in?",08Nov2020,1
156,"So I’ve been with my girlfriend (18F) for three months and I love her. However, I’ve noticed that I’m emotionally dependent on her, and I only realised that that’s the problem today. I am sad and anxious when I am not with her, I constantly doubt whether or not she loves or cares about me and always worry about her cheating on me. I’ve lost interest in my own ambitions and dreams because all I think about is being loved by her. She tells me all the time that she loves me and has been very supportive and kind and lovely about it all. However, every time we talk about it I feel like she loses a little bit of respect and interest for me. She has actually explicitly said that my insecurities and mental health problems don’t make her feel any different about me, she said this yesterday, but my mind tells me this is a lie and that she is just pretending. This is absolutely horrible and it’s ruining my life. I don’t feel like an individual, I’ve lost all pride in my sport and my ambitions, and I have zero self esteem unless I feel that my girlfriend loves me. I’m seeing a therapist, and I mentioned some of this to her, but I didn’t mention the term “emotional dependency”. I also feel as if I didn’t give her all the information she needed to help me. I will see her again soon so will try to do it then.

Also, I pay very close attention to every part of every message my girlfriend sends me, scanning it for any indication that she doesn’t care about me as much as I care about her, or that she’s lost interest or that she’s cheating on me or that she thinks I’m pathetic, and of course because I’m looking for them, I find them. And then I take them to heart, and I start trying to test her, withdrawing in order to try and get her to express what I want her to express. Obviously this is incredibly, unbelievably toxic and frankly I’m very lucky that she hasn’t broken up with me already because of it, and I know that if I keep going like this it won’t be long before she does, and not only that but I will drive myself into the ground because this is fucking exhausting to do every day of my life. I need help, please. I feel like such a small part of her life. She has a good social life, lots of friends, parties at the weekends, is doing a degree she loves and is having a great life. I have no friends, no social life, haven’t been to a party in about 10 months, am doing a degree I couldn’t give less of a shit about and am now half-arsing the sport that I’ve invested myself into for the past five years because I’m so mentally exhausted by this and have lost interest in anything that isn’t my girlfriend. When she goes out partying I basically have a panic attack that she’s going to cheat on me, and she doesn’t reply to me while she’s out and it’s just fucking embarrassing and makes me hate myself. I’m a fucking train wreck. Please don’t judge me for this, I know it’s toxic, manipulative, repulsive, I know all that and I don’t need anyone to tell me. I need suggestions for what I can do now, to help myself and save my relationship and myself. I’m desperate and I’m really scared. Any advice would be helpful. Thank you for reading.",08Nov2020,1

158,"The first paragraph just explains our relationship and the bad things that were within it. The second explains how I have felt after the breakup and I’m just wondering how to get better. 
The second is mainly the most necessary to read because the first is only for background info. 

We broke up a few days ago. These few days have been crazy. I’m only 14, so I know this all may sound ridiculous. We dated for a year. We were so close with each other and we told each other literally everything. I always felt so safe and comfortable with him and in his arms. He made me so happy, but it had started to fade away because of anxiety. Of course I still loved him and I still do now. I have really bad anxiety and OCD problems. As we got deeper into it and more close with each other my OCD just revolved around him more and more. It took up everything. When we hung out sometimes I would worry that things were sexual assault whenever they weren’t. I would worry that he was toxic or that I was toxic when that wasn’t the case. I couldn’t talk to any other boys without worrying that I was a cheater. This was so stressful and painful. As a compulsion I had to confess all of these types of thoughts to him. It stressed him out so much. He has mental problems too. We were making each other feel worse sometimes and we didn’t want to. He is the type of person who copes with bad feelings with isolation and just being alone. Although, i’m more of an introvert i’m also very dependent on other people so when i’m upset I panic when i’m alone and so I have to be with people. This also created conflict whenever we were both going through really bad times at the same time. Dating whenever both people have mental illness can be so frustrating and sad. He broke up with me because of all of this. He said we need time to better ourselves and then we can get back together one day. 

 After we broke up i’ve been a complete mess. The first 2 days (i think) I just felt so depressed that I couldn’t get up to do anything. I didn’t do any schoolwork and I don’t think I ate very much, I just laid there and uncontrollably sobbed for hours and just had so much anxiety too. I spent a lot of time talking with my friends and my mom. The days after that I have had too much energy. I keep doing things that I wouldn’t normally do. This is also kind of painful. Every time I think of him, I either feel completely numb or I feel so much pain that it feels unbearable. I was so dependent on him for my happiness and I admitted that but I don’t know how to get to a point where I wouldn’t be. I want to be with him in the future, it’s all i want. I don’t know how to better myself. I just want to forget about us getting back together because it’s already been a barrier for me to get better. What do I do?",08Nov2020,1
160,"Sorry to sound a little edgy here, but I was wondering how I can tell if I'm depressed. I mean, I don't feel depressed all the time, just when I'm negative. Then all the stuff in my life really weighs down on me.  


For context, I was bullied in school and my father was a narcissist, so you can imagine how that turned out. I don't wish for sympathy because that has not served me well, but I want some pointers. I can go more into detail if someone wishes it.",08Nov2020,1
161,"So for a bit of background information. Im a 23 year old male. My doctor prescribed me propranolol 80mg prolonged released capsules aka bedranol. I was prescribed this for anxiety and extreme fear of having a heart attack at night time. I start to panic at night that I'm about to die because I can't feel my heart beating. Which makes me scared to fall asleep in case my heart stops while I'm sleeping. I told the doctor this fear stems from my mum telling me 3 of her uncles died in their early 30s of silent heart attacks. So they literally just dropped dead with no indication that anything was wrong. So I'm terrified whatever gene or trait that caused this to happen to them has been passed onto me. 

I've been taking propranolol for over a month now. I feel so tired both physically and mentally. I have no energy or drive to do anything. I can't get motivated to exercise. It's also affecting my work. I just feel so spaced out and like my body has been drained of all it's energy. 

Is this normal while taking propranolol? I am considering giving up taking it.",08Nov2020,1
162,"So I have a lot of different habits and tics and I wanted to know what certain problems they kinda lead up too (ex. ocd, stress, anxiety) stuff like that. A few of my different habits are head shaking, eyebrow furrowing, digging my nails into my palms, a vocal tic where I kinda make this small noise idk how to explain it, tapping my nails on my glasses, counting things and shapes and outlines in my head and sometimes i’ll count it to songs or words, idk it’s weird, and sometimes I’ll shake my hand randomly when holding something (usually my phone). Thanks :))",08Nov2020,1
163,"So I have these few habits and I was just wondering if it’s any sort of mental problem or something idk. So it sounds kinda weird but I get bothered when my fingers are different temperatures, like my two are cold and the others are warm, so then I’ll wrap my hand around my cold fingers to try and make them warmer. Another really weird thing I do is putting my finger on my lip (no clue why) and just smelling them
after. And lastly, sometimes I pull down the skin under my fingernail and then put my nails over my lip then let go of the skin, I really don’t know how to explain it but I tried to the best of my ability, sorry :(",08Nov2020,1
164,"I have been assessed as showing some schizoid traits (introverted nature, inability/lack of interest to connect with others beyond a superficial level, muted reactions, in general tending to keep events/thoughts to myself and often not sharing even with immediate family because I think it is unnecessary and often getting scolded for this) though not severe enough for a personality disorder, plus anxiety which has been present and increasing since a few years now due to severe career confusion and indecision and fear of becoming professionally irrelevant.

There are a few reasons I think I might be on the spectrum, listed below. I know that self-assessment is not recommended. I had tried discussing some of these points with a psychiatrist recently, but he dismissed them as overthinking without going through all of it, and also said that even if I was on the spectrum, 'the problems end around the adolescent/early teenage years and don't suddenly come up in your early 30s', despite my mentioning that confusion/physical awkwardness/asocial nature were always around since childhood. This was not the same person who had done the schizoid/anxiety assessment a few months ago. I have had issues with depression and have taken meds briefly because of some severe stress I faced a few years ago, but multiple therapists since then have pretty much focused on the depression aspect and not really looked into the pre existing issues (except for one of those generic suggestions like making pros vs cons lists).

**Asocial nature, solo activities:** Always immersed in things like sketching, reading or playing with blocks/action figures as a child. Also spend to use quite some time reading books and illustrated books on how different machines work and other 'general knowledge' related things. Used to go for basketball and some adventure activities for 2-3 years around age 10-12, then football for quite a few years, but rather than making friends, some of these activities turned into brief obsessions (horses/horse riding for example was a pretty strong one for a few months, so was writing down lists of football squad players). Playing with a couple of friends/myself often involved creating modified scenarios from cartoons etc around age 11-12. For a brief couple of years in college and just before, I was \*very\* outgoing, made a lot of friends, but ended up being ignored by pretty much all of them as I didn't try to restrict myself to a single group (maybe I was trying to fit in with too many different sets of people?) - and also hated the fact that they couldn't even show simple courtesy, for example of informing me of changes in plans we had made (where the f\*\*\* is that 'empathy' which everyone exemplifies?), not even occasionally giving me a phone call (why should I ALWAYS be the one who makes the call?). Have no problems with meeting relatives/participating with others in large groups/functions etc, but never feel like talking too much to others. Now am pretty much asocial and typically have no problems with it except when I constantly get talked down about not being social enough and it being a major reason for my career issues (as if the constant misguidance and invalidation of my, in hindsight, reasonable thoughts by you had no role to play in it).

**Interests - sketching:** Frequently drew only a small number of household appliances as a small child (around age 3), then some specific vehicles, then planes (after my first ever air journey), then trains, then 3-4 selected animals, in phases, and always found it difficult to draw anything apart from the 'in-phase' thing. Always used to get a lot of praise because of how accurately I was able to sketch these things. Lost interest in sketching after appearing for a couple of exams and getting decent grades in them. Tried to restart after my 12th, did it for a little while (not even a few months) and gave up again because I felt I just couldn't go beyond some very limited things.

**Interests - maps:** Reading and drawing maps from atlases as a kid, several flags and capitals/cities memorized, creating imaginary ones, now surfing Google Maps and often looking for public transport routes in metro cities. I have lived in multiple metro cities for small durations (work, internships etc) and can still remember names and approximate locations of areas I have never ever visited.

**Interests - trains:** As a kid I used to get extremely engrossed in railway routes and timetables, and even today am familiar with names and approximate locations of several places and trains. Also interested in the actual trains themselves, with the interest taking up an added angle as I studied electrical engineering. I still sometimes watch random train videos etc.

**Others:** If something new interests me, I can suddenly immerse myself into it for a few days and then I quickly lose interest in it and give it up. A couple of psychiatrists have said that changing interests is quite normal, but I am concerned about the intensity when they are 'on' and the rate at which they wear off, so am a bit worried about my inability to sustain things in the longer run (especially about careers). Sometimes there is this impulsiveness when I suddenly want to do a lot of things, start off with a number of them and give up on all of them. But some interests, such as trains, maps and even an interest in languages/wordplay, have always lingered on. Have always liked music, but right now it is restricted to only a few selected songs/artistes. Haven't really 'updated' beyond the early 2010s.

**Physical/body related:** There are some body movements and habits - a long-term one in scratching/fondling my scalp, a phase in childhood when I was frequently scolded for blinking my eyes in an unusual manner, a brief phase when I used to tense some of my facial muscles, and most recent ones in the form of abdominal muscle/shoulder tensing/vibrating. The abdominal twitching was noted as 'fidgeting behaviour' and formed part of the anxiety diagnosis. Around age 12-14, many people used to remark that I walk with a bit of a limp, with the remarks and probable motion defect reducing to much more subtle levels around college time. Sometimes I find myself in awkward positions, for example when I am doing some work and have to handle multiple objects, I sort of get confused in figuring out how to hold which object, how to adjust multiple things - it takes me too long to realise that I can simply keep one/two objects aside for the time being and focus on the rest. My handwriting is poor and messy and I sometimes feel awkward when handling tools, but I never faced any problems while handling tiny Lego blocks.

**Confusion/indecisiveness/double checking/overthinking/time management:** I always feel I don't know enough and want to find out more. Constant career indecision is now troubling me more as I have been introduced to many more possibilities, but given my age it is also a question of whether anyone would be give me a chance (already rejected for entry level jobs, before and throughout Covid) without a massive pay cut (already a somewhat low salary, though sufficient; but non-software entry level pay scales are \*abysmal\*) as it is of my willingness to try out something. When writing an email I always think a lot about my words, and sometimes need to ask another person if they think it's OK even for simple issues. I have been told on a few occasions that I am not able to express my thoughts clearly, and I do get confused and fumble under pressure or when suddenly put into the spotlight, though many also say that I make solid, brief and powerful statements when I do say something. There are often situations when I get scolded because there is a simple, common sense solution that I wasn't able to think of; there are also occasions when I myself question why I did what I did despite that lingering feeling saying that something seems off. These things often result in wastage of time, which brings me to time management issues and of late, wanting to multitask and not being able to accomplish any of the multiple tasks as a result, then again feeling the need to 'cool down' and losing more time in the process. This issue was noted in the assessment as 'problems with time management at work due to large number of interests', which is not the case as career indecision is the only thing causing me problems with career, while actually having no/minimal impact on my work output. I sometimes find myself lost in fantasizing over what might have been had things turned out differently at some select points in my life. I face several situations where I feel the need to check, double check and recheck, tending to sometimes miss out things and panic at the last moment regardless.

\*Realised that I spent over two hours writing and revising all this\*

Now if I do happen to be on the spectrum, is there any point in trying to get evaluated and get an official diagnosis **in India**? If I do get diagnosed as being on the spectrum, what kind of options would I have in terms of support, careers etc?",08Nov2020,1

177,"I have always had mental health issues, well from the age of 12/13 upwards. I think it was really set in when I experienced a traumatic event with one of my family members. This family member also has mental health issues that are clearly much worse than mine (I'm talking bipolar, ADHD etc) this said person is just unstable (but genuinely thinks they are completely normal and the victim in every situation they create) our relationship has always filled my mind with questions, but that's not what I'm here to talk about. 

A few months ago, this family member (after being back in my life for a while) started his sh*t once again. He is mentally very delayed, I feel. Like 30 but the mind of a child. Also possibly has Munchausens (person LIES like they will stop breathing if they don't tell a lie, I genuinely don't think anything that has come out of his mouth has ever been true) 

It's been a long few months of this family member harassing and intimidating and threatening myself and my partner. Mostly my partner.  We literally have done NOTHING to him. Like I can't even stress this enough, absolutely nothing. This has all stemmed from his jealousy of my relationship with our mum. (I'm the youngest and only girl so of course we are super close) (also he mentally and physically abused my mum from the minute he could walk and talk) 

It caused me to have a mental break down about 2 months ago and I have been put on antidepressants and 3 tabs a day for anxiety. After doing everything we could, not retaliating (we have never retaliated anyway), getting extra security measures put into our house because he came to our house in the middle of the night and slashed our car tyres. Even showing up to my partners place of work and threatening him and terrifying him. Even contacting the police multiple times who just don't want to be bothered with it.

We have both finally decided there is nothing more we can do, other than to go see a solicitor (lawyer) and get an injuction (restraining order) against him. It will be before a judge tomorrow, and I feel sick with anxiety over it. I know it needs to be done, for my safety, my partners safety and our children but I can't help but feel awful about it. I'm terrified of what this family member will do when they get served with the papers by the police (if judge approves of our application for the order) I just know it's going to make my whole family fall out with me because they all defend him and baby him. 

I just needed to get this off my chest, I'm scared. It needs to be done, but I'm scared. 😔",08Nov2020,1

179,"My dad is, ironically, a detective for domestic violence. He was a police officer for 15 years before then (don't get me started on this) and has been having a hard time adjusting to his sweet baby girl having a boyfriend for the past 2 years.

Last night, on the day of our 2 year anniversary, we were playing a board game and my dad tried to intimidate BF by grabbing and squeezing the back of his neck (playfully..? This is how he interacts with his friends at the office). When dad sat back down, I grabbed his arm and looked him in the eyes, ""No. No, you can't do that to him."" Dad said, ""Ok."" and we went back to the boardgame. At another point if the night, he abruptly kicked the boardgame box across the livingroom when BF upset him in the game... I can't help thinking that I could have done more, BF's neck is still sore from the whole thing and the whole incident just makes my heart race and my eyes water up.


I know that I need to do something about this. I'm planning on talking to dad on the phone or meeting with him in person... but it's so weird seeing my dad act like this. My heart's breaking and I'm scared that my relationship with him won't be the same.

Guess I just needed to vent, but I'm open to advice on how to handle this.

180,"Hey, if you decided to read this, thank you and I really appreciate it! But to get started, I’m a 19 year old male diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, Depression, Anxiety, Mood Disorder, Lyme Disease, and Ehlers Danlos Syndrome for almost all of my life. Luckily, even tho it came back 2 times, I’m okay and free of Lyme Disease...so I’m not too worried about that. Also, I don’t believe I have mood disorder, but that’s a whole other discussion. Back to the point tho, I’m exhausted, lost, and seeking advice on what to do next with my life while dealing with all of these challenges. I seem to be misunderstood. I don’t have a job, dropped out of college, and lastly my parents, siblings, and friends don’t understand what I have going on. Don’t worry, I’m not really expecting my sisters or friends to really understand, just thought it was an important detail to emphasize how alone I am. Back to the topic tho, I don’t know if it’s because they don’t believe me, they’re stubborn, they don’t have a lot money, or simply have no idea how to help me. I’ve been to doctors in the past for almost all of these things, but they shove tons of pills down my throat and I just feel suppressed, or tell me they don’t know enough about it and just go recommend another doctor. And I mean this with the most respect possible to all healthcare workers, or anyone who’s tried, but most of them don’t understand or really help me. Luckily, although it’s challenging and I’ve been there before, I am not suicidal, and I know that there is hope for me. Listen, just like everyone, I want to be successful and have a wonderful wife and amazing children. I want to have my own home and a steady job that I enjoy. I want all of these things, and I’m not giving up and never will, however I’m finding a lot of difficulty striving for these goals with all of these things going on. If someone would be kind enough to help me out and give some some advice, it would mean the world to me. P.S. I don’t take criticism to heart, so say whatever you have to say. Like If I’m doing something wrong, please tell me, no hard feelings. I’m also open to any questions of any kind! From the bottom of my heart, with every ounce of soul in my body, thank you so much.",08Nov2020,1

I dont really ever go out with friends, because i think, theres no one to hang out cuz i have like no close friends.  I also think i have social anxiety or some like that, so its not easy for me to just ask some random people to do something. The connection between my parents and me is not the best aswell and we're kinda poor.  
 I'm not even sure, if its a good idea to make this post.   
So last weekend, I was in a big city with my family, and the big places and the possibilities of what you can do (well if you have money lol). Sometimes, i just have some ""moments"", where I just want to move as fast as possible out of my home (I thought I wasnt that comfortable around a lot of people, not sure if this is still correct). In my mind, i want to go to work as soon as possible and earn some money to move out. Not sure how i would be supposed to find new friends since im an introvert and stuff like that.

182,"I was on Adderall (or other ADHD meds) for years, then went off it a couple years after grad school. For reasons, I recently started taking it again along with Wellbutrin. I've been doing better with my work, focus, and have been out of the sadness fog for a bit. 
 
But I am not affectionate at all. My husband and I were decently close before I started taking my meds again, but now I barely tolerate him holding my hand. I didn't tell him how bad I'm doing in this regard but did tell him that while I adjust to my new meds, I am not able to be affectionate and I'm just not interested in that. He was understanding at the time (he's struggled with similar issues before).
 
Yesterday we were out at a hotel celebrating my birthday and he brought up how the lack of affection is making it difficult for him/us and I have no idea what to do. I've been crying on and off for 12 hours now. I'm mad at him for ruining the only day off I've gotten in a few years (young kids at home), upset that it feels like he's blaming me for the fact this is happening (I'm just trying to get my meds in a good place), worried that I can't fix this because affection seems so off-putting right now, and wondering if I should just go off everything again and deal with my ADHD and minor depression myself like I have been (he's against this but also is clearly not okay with the side effects I'm adjusting to).",08Nov2020,1

184,"Since I was pretty young (5th gradeish when they started popping up) I've had some subtle mental issues that I've ignored ranging from anxiety attacks to thinking a good bit about offing myself. However, like a few others in my family with confirmed mental illness, it's really hard for me to talk about and do a very good job of hiding it. I think I'm depressed in the sense that I fantasize about suicide and feel hopeless frequently except I don't have that depression trait of not doing anything. For example, I have relatively good grades, a lot of kind friends, and some aspirations, but I'm almost always in this weird depressive state. For example, I'll be casually studying for a test, take a 15 min. break, and just think about how great it would be to jump off an 8 story building. I would never do it primarily because I know it would hurt a lot of those around me. I think the only sign to those around me that I'm struggling with this would be that I miss school about once every 2 weeks so I can just lay in my bed and pretend I'm dead.

187,"This  may not seem critical, but this - along with many other things - just keeps poisoning my life every day. I know if I get rid of this it will make life so much more enjoyable, but I just don't know what to do.

**Here's the problem:**  
Whenever plans have to change, or the outcome isn't what was originally expected, EVEN IF THAT'S BETTER, I tend to get mega bummed. Like really down and out, wanting to just throw things out then and there and go cry in a ditch. Stupid right? 

Well, even if things are factually better the way they turn out, it just doesn't feel like it. I guess it feels like the effort I put in was subverted and wasted, that it wasn't worth it. Like the outcome is severely different than what got me motivated originally, and so the motivation, and the mood and self esteem along with it just poofs away. This frequently prevents me from getting things finished.

**Example:**  
I'm an art student, and I frequently do character concepts.   
In the process, I quickly turn to expect certain things from the future result, i.e. that the character expresses certain parts of their background from the looks alone, has a certain aire or combination of emotions about them. And I kinda have to do this in order to set project goals.

Well what ends up happening is that certain things just don't work. Either I'm unable to bring things I want forth despite best effort, or things don't groove together, or I'd just be better design-wise to abandon certain, if not the majority, of threads and aspects I fell in love with. 

This feels like crap. The result feels shallow because of all the information I had to abandon, and kind of reminds me of my ineptitude. Even if technically, as the ""rules"" say, it would've probably been worse or impossible to do what I wanted. 

It also feels like giving up, which I don't want to do, because giving up easily is a trait I know I have, and so any argument that calls to abandon work feels like a manifestation of that weakness, and therefore is an argument I don't trust.

And so, the choices I then have are - quit in grueling disappointment because I gave up, or work further indefinitely, delaying the result and growing increasingly disappointed anyway because things aren't moving.

Either way feels bad, and I don't really have a resolution to this; and it's not just the art, it permeates all aspects of life, this pestilence!   
I know I have to cut the losses eventually, but the potential gains feel more valuable than the losses.

I want to fix this before it ruins my life any more. I just know that *there must be some logical fallacy that gets me stuck in this*, some kind of oversight, that's why I'm asking for outside help/opinions. *Any tips or resources will be greatly appreciated!*

**TL;DR** Keep chasing (possibly)castles in the sky, don't believe the castles are sky castles. Don't want to give up, because giving up=bad, so either get really bummed when can't get there, or get really bummed having to settle for anything else. Hurts bad. Halp.",08Nov2020,1

(my parents don’t get along, they fight constantly and i’m pretty sure they’ll get divorced one day they just don’t the sake of my sister an i (it’s actually worse with them together tho)) she accuses other people for things a lot and it’s very stressful living with her but i’ve kind of managed. i’m writing this though because i feel like our relationship has gotten worse again. i’m not going to go into detail about our fights because i don’t feel comfortable doing so but it’s often a lot of yelling, me crying and door slams. a lot of the time what we’re fighting about is my fault but it’s also her fault a lot of the time too. the problem is that while i’ve tried so many times to take different approaches so we don’t get into fights she doesn’t seem to change at all and doesn’t really make an effort to (i’m always right mindset kicking in).  when we fight she’ll often compare me to my older sister (she’s better than me anyway) or my friends, she calls me names and will yell at me. when she finally gets tired or realizes that i’m right in certain situations she’ll guilt me “you’ve ruined the day””after all i’ve done for you..””blame it all on me, i guess i’m a horrible mother””okay i’m the bad guy” then she’ll procede to tell me she’s not mad at me even though she is definitely still mad at me. she also has a habit of telling everyone about our fights and telling people i’ve been awful. during these moments i retreat to my room to cool down (my cooling down techniques are bad- i’ll cry a lot and recently i’ve taken up punching and scratching my legs to get my anger out. i know that’s not good but idk what else to do sometimes) sometimes she’ll come into  my room when we’re fighting and i’ll tell her to get out so i can be alone and she won’t leave.  while i know this is rude, sometimes i will have to physically push her out of the room because she won’t leave even if i’ve told her she needs to get out so i can collect my thoughts. after our fights we almost never make up or apologize, instead we’ll just wait it out until we’ve both forgotten about it enough. whenever i try to confront her about it she always says “oh i can change” “i won’t do that next time” she never follows through it’s been years i’ve been telling her this. whenever i hear her say she’ll try to get better i already know it’s straight bullshit. it’s been years and i’m tired of this already. idk what to do. is it my fault that we fight? i feel weird because even though we fight she still does a lot of great things for me. am i overreacting? other people probably have it worse so maybe this is just me idk what i’m doing wrong. :(",08Nov2020,1

It didn't help that his sister who was in the same house as us, stopped being friends with me out of nowhere and that destroyed me. I started hooking up with another guy fresh out of trauma and got way too attached, who eventually ghosted me and then keep calling me out of nowhere giving me false hope and I cannot move on.

197,"Quick backstory. My ex and I broke up after a blissful 2 year relationship. I loved her with everything and supported her with everything. She broke up with me claiming that she feels like she's lesbian so naturally, I let her go. Before this break up, she had broken up with me 2 more times because of her depression but got back together with me very soon. I told her that we can fight it together, and to rely on me. And since that breakup, I kept her good and made sure to remind her that she's loved everyday. I am a naturally optimistic person and I don't suffer from anything mentally.

Now since the last breakup, its been 2 months. I went no contact because I was in a lot of pain since I had thought I was going to marry this girl but now my mind is as clear as day now. She just feels like she's drowning. She uses twitter as her diary and I checked it recently and her tweets have been extremely alarming. Its almost like she's become this completely different person. She tweets about crying often and being depressed and how dis-attached from reality she feels (derealization). She argues with random people for fun, and is intaking everything toxically around her. It makes me very concerned. I know I don't have a part in her life anymore as she chose to leave me but I am naturally a very caring person, if someone opens up to me and I barely know them I will listen to them and check up on them regularly. And this is someone I genuinely love and care about. It seems like she's screaming for help.

I’ve told myself I’m fine and that I’m overreacting over and over again in my mind and then it actually started to work.

I can barely focus on what made me so upset in the first place, and as of now I’m weirdly jittery. It’s like, how I usually react to being cold, but I’m not cold at all, but it’s the exact reaction down to how my mind feels. I’ve had brief periods of being extremely upset and sometimes nostalgic, and then happiness and confidence that eventually diminished. There are times where I wouldn’t be hungry for days but I’d still eat, and then days where I felt too hungry, overly hungry with a bunch of cravings. Whenever my mom comes around I become very rude I guess, I can’t help being aggressive and kind of snapping at her. I feel bad, but I also don’t, I don’t know how to explain to her that I’m not really mad at her in those moments, despite the fact I’m frustrated with her in a general sense. it feels worse and almost completely different from months ago.

200,"Hi everyone. First of all, thank you for listening to my story. I have always been a stressed person, but never experienced an attack per se. I started a masters in another country this fall, very far away from my home. During the last exam week I started noticing that I was tired and that my mind was slowly fading away, literally felt that I was zoning out. I attributed it to the study stress and exhaustion. However, I started freaking out and thinking that I was literally losing my mind and becoming crazy. On the day of the last exam I started the day crying and made the exam during a complete tranced state. I was able to do it and I believe I passed it, somehow. I thought that would be the end of it but it was not. I knew something was off and I booked an appointment with the general practitioner. On the day of the appointment I lost it, started crying and shaking and she told me I was experiencing an anxiety/panic stress induced attack. She prescribed some tranquilizers and I took them. She said I would be okay. The day after was terrible, cried all day and felt my life was over. Today (two days after) I have not cried but I feel sad, of course. However, I can feel it could get better. My mind is still zoned, gone, even though my friends say I look and act very lucid. I have booked an appointment with the University psychologist because I know I need more help. However, I would like to know if anyone has experienced this panicky/anxious feeling for over a week, as I have read that usually panic attacks last for a short period of time. Would this zoning out feeling go away? Will I ever recover my brain back?",08Nov2020,1
201,"     Hi, r/Anxiety. 
I have been going to therapy for a couple of months, talking about different topics related to my daily life. So, two days ago in my weekly consult, I talked about my asthma.
Since I have memory, I have suffered from periods of weeks during I can't breathe well. Is not as movies or hard cases that you can hear, I don't stop breathing suddenly, just is harder to get air to my lungs. I lived the biggest part of my life in very cold weather, (it commonly had -5° Celsius) so it was normal that if I went outside without a coat, thee asthma would be present in a few hours or the next day. Now, and since four years, I live in a more tropical place, where the minimum temperature has been 13° Celsius and the average ~30° Celsius, so the asthma is now rare. But the winter is coming and since a week an asthma period as came. So, I related that to my therapist, and coincidentally the day before the asthma period started I discuss with my mother and the therapist pointed that some times the asthma is strongly related with problems with the maternal relationship, but we don't give to much importance to it. So I want to search for more information, but I haven't found on Google. Do you guys know something about the topic or any source to investigate?",08Nov2020,1
202,My mental image of myself is very different from my actual physical form. Including different hair and eye colors. Does anyone know anything about this?,08Nov2020,1
203,I (21F) have been struggling with depression for about 6 years now. I’ve tried taking medication and therapy in the past and none of which have helped. Recently my mental well being has taken a turn for the worse and something new happened that hasn’t happened before. I’ve been struggling with mutism. During the first episode it lasted about two days where I was physically unable to talk. I could only communicate in written form in blunt sentences. And it’s been a few days since then and the same thing is happening again and I don’t know why. Has anyone here with depression ever gone through something like this? If so how did you get past it?,08Nov2020,1
204,"So hello. I don't really know where to start from and how to explain in order.

I always had a social anxiety which makes sense for me. I often feel stress for no reasons but sometimes I feel anxiety of very random or even silly things like unknown number is calling for me or I got a new message request. However these ""anxieties"" haven't been anxieties for me for my life. They just came out of nowhere. And there are very random things that came out of nowhere and i got anxiety of them. Sometimes it feels more like a random thought got stuck in your brain and you cannot do not think of that. Idk if get what i mean. Also sometimes I feel insecure: for example that I can be assaulted in the street and not gonna be able to defend myself ( I am more afraid of not being able to defend myself than being beaten and I am 19 male btw). Hope you will understand my situation. Also sorry for my English.",08Nov2020,1
205,"
I have become so used to my negative emotions, which I’ve had for so long, that I now have a very high tolerance for them. This has decreased my motivation to change.

Moreover, I’m starting to almost enjoy beating myself up mentally. Sometimes it almost feels like I’m m purposely inducing these “negative” states in myself. I think this is partially because the idea of not being self-aware of my faults terrifies me and I never want to forget them so that if/when someone else points them out it won’t be a surprise to me. But the other maybe larger part is that I’m becoming addicted to the emotional intensity, and negative emotions are as good as positive ones in satisfying that craving. 

This isn’t an excuse, and I know I’m capable of changing, but I’m finding it difficult mostly because I don’t really want to stop. But part of me does. The main reason I want to stop is for the sake of others around me, and for the sake of other people’s perception of me. I find myself constantly trying to understand how this behavior might come across to others and I do realize how annoying and draining it is. I do not want to be seen that way. 

Any advice or insight or similar experiences? I think I need professional help.",08Nov2020,1
206,"I feel like maybe I have dysthymia. Ever since I was like 14-15 (I’m now 17) I’ve wondered if I had depression, but ultimately always put it down to wanting to make excuses for being lazy and greedy/being dramatic. But a few months ago I heard of dysthymia and it was like everything suddenly made sense.. but of course I can’t be sure I actually have it or not. 

I was thinking of going to a therapist or something about it but I’m worried.. what if there’s nothing wrong with me and I really am just dramatic/making excuses? And they think I’m just some dumb kid wasting time that other people need? 

Of course, ultimately it would be better if I’m actually fine because I wouldn’t have to bother with treatment. But that’s also worrying me, because if I’m fine then it means I have to stay like this forever - I’m not miserable but I wouldn’t say I’m ‘happy’ either. Just a perpetual state of ‘ok’ which occasionally tips into ‘kind of good’/‘slightly bad’ :/ 

I don’t know.",08Nov2020,1

I feel really not great right now, and I really need support.  This will sound frivolous.  You have to realize, this is the biggest thing in the world for me, as of right now.  
I feel like I’m about to lose it. 
I’ll try to keep this post brief.  I’m not suicidal.  I’m trying not to have a breakdown.  I have no one I can talk to and I need clarity.  

This post will sound shallow—please understand, I’m not here to get berated for sounding shallow, and I don’t mean this in a shallow way.  I know that people are more than their looks, but this post has a lot to do with looks.  I’ve already gotten so much $&amp;@€ on reddit for trying to seek advice.

Over the course of my life, I’ve gotten lots and lots of compliments about my appearance, and at various times, lots of attention from girls.  When this attention goes away, it’s as if I can’t remember that it ever happened.  The compliments and attention lose their value.  Typically, this is because I never actually pursued most of the women who gave me attention.  I don’t know for certain that the attention was not superficial.

I just got out of a relationship of 4 years, two months ago.  Since I have been single, I have had a lot of trouble.

I have absolutely no idea as to my physical value as an adult male.  At this point, I’m so confused.  I’ve been told that I’m gorgeous, beautiful, cute, handsome, hot, at various times.  I’ve caused men who have girlfriends to have miniature meltdowns, even when I’ve done nothing, even when I haven’t interacted with their girlfriend directly.  Included on this list is an actual male model who does big time work for an agency out of New York, who I somehow bothered.  I have no idea how. 

But then, I end up feeling alienated by very attractive women—and all women.  I feel like a worm.  I don’t understand. 

And to add to the confusion, my body-fat percentage changed over the last two years.  My face looks different.  It rounded out, and I have fat on my neck. 

Since I started to look different, I no longer get compliments like “you’re gorgeous” or “you’re beautiful”—“your hot.”  My girlfriend dumped me literally when I was at my highest weight, and when I had my shirt off.

Because of this, I already crash-dieted and did intense exercise for most of October.  It was extreme, admittedly.  Unfortunately, the changes have taken place in my body.  My face looks almost exactly the same.  I am in histrionics about this.  My neck fat is the same.  I can never remember having neck fat before.  I’m scared. 

I feel like I’m not attracting the attention of any women around me.  And I’m going absolutely crazy.  I don’t understand.  Everyone on reddit keeps saying that I either need a purpose, which I have—I have vocational, spiritual, and artistic goals—that I need confidence—I have that, I’m comfortable approaching women, speaking in front of audiences, and doing acting in front of crowds—that I need to “cultivate interests”—I do mathematics, music, writing, philosophy, history, ornithology, hiking, acting, and I have about a hundred other things that I do.  And then some people say “well, you need to realize that people are more than just their looks.”  I know that!!  I know I’m more than my looks.  If anything, I’m worried my charisma is what carried me throughout the years; that women were more interested in the highly ambitious intellectual, and that my body and face were some sort of afterthought.  That my body and face were a deficit—that they were something to *tolerate*

But the only way for me to meet women right now is by approaching them in the only coffee shop that’s in my area.  I’m scared to get emotionally involved with anyone after my four year relationship—but I don’t feel attractive enough to hookup, and I feel so rarely attracted to individual women.  That spark of interest barely ever happens to me, and it’s always for people who feel way out of my league—but then I say this, and people are saying “you should model” “you’re handsome” “you’re gorgeous.”  And when I attempt to speak to girls, it’s like...I’m a worm!  I don’t get it.  I’ve greeted a few recently, confident and friendly, and sometimes the greetings back are as if I’m something slimy that just came out of a drain.  All I’m trying to do is *talk* to girls right now—I’m not even looking for sex.  But then I desperately want validation.  If only a beautiful blonde could say “you’re handsome” I’d feel fine.  That’s what’s $&amp;@£ed.  That’s all it would take, and I’d feel like I was soaring.

If you made it to the end, I’m truly sorry.  I don’t know what to do.  Last time I posted about this, someone berated me for doing extreme-dieting and thought I was being anorexic.  And other people attacked me for talking about looks.  I have literally no where else to turn, and every time I see my neckfat in the mirror, I’m losing my €£¥*.  I feel frantic.  And I keep wondering “what if nothing’s different when I lose all that neckfat?”  What if my jawline was always soft?  And I panic.  What if they only liked me for my personality?  Or out of convenience?  Or because they didn’t value themselves?  I keep thinking the reason my girlfriend dumped me was because of how I looked—and then I imagine her with someone who’s in better shape, taller, a nicer jaw, and I feel ill.

I feel like all the attention I used to get made me value that type of attention so much, that I feel miserable without validation.  And the idea that it’s inaccessible right now...aahhh",08Nov2020,1
208,"Hello everyone,  I’d like to explain my question first. My behavior in relationships indicates that I have a trauma. I severely struggle with commitment issues AND a fear of loss at the same time and I have a sexual dysfunction. My therapist suggested that I am missing a sense of basic trust. But you don’t just lose your sense of basic trust for no reason, right?  I really want to change for the better but if I don’t know what my trauma is, how can I ever heal? When I think about my childhood, I only remember positive things. What if I was sexually abused when I was like only one year old. How would I ever remember that? Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? What would you do if you were me? I feel like I need to heal from something but I really can’t put my finger on it and don’t know what this event or memory could be that has traumatized me so much.",08Nov2020,1
209,"I’ve never told anyone this, not even anonymously, so I’m not really comfortably saying what conditions I’ve been lying about, but ever since I was little I would fake illnesses and ailments just for attention. I didn’t think about why I did it until recently, and it is for that attention. It’s strange bc I don’t necessarily like pity or sympathy but that’s not all I get out of it. It makes me feel like people care about me and I feel like I wouldn’t feel that way if I didn’t make things up.

For Clarification, I don’t take it as far as some people do, and I’ve never really faked anything terminal. I don’t tell these lies to certain people, like parents or people who would tell my parents, and I haven’t told any medical professionals that I have anything I don’t, but I have in a way told them about legit symptoms that could apply to the things I’m faking in hopes that somehow it will turn out I’m not faking it. I make sure that I don’t use what I’m faking in ways that could hurt people who actually have those conditions, but I still feel horrible for doing it and yet, I can’t bring myself to stop. I think the tendency stemmed from maladaptive daydreams and once I accidentally brought it into my real life and I can’t stop. I’ve done it for too long.

I don’t know if any of you are familiar with these things but I don’t know what to do. Am I really a horrible person? And is coming clean really the best way to fix that? They say honesty is the best policy but I do feel like people would be hurt to know I was lying, just for attention. And I did it long before I knew it was wrong",08Nov2020,1
210,"Hi all,

I'll keep it short without much backstory as it doesn't really matter rn

I'm currently struggling with the fact I'm completely losing my grip on reality in the way that I don't feel any connection to my surroundings and/or myself, I seem to be on some sort of ""auto-pilot"" watching as everything just plays out without actually being in control. On top of this I've been severely depressed; it all feels like a burden, there's no reason to get out of bed and get through my day.

However, when I experience one of these episodes where I get detached from reality, myself and my surroundings I'm extremely susceptible to suicidal thoughts to the point where I actually go through with it. I'm wondering if there's anyway to snap out of the derealization/depersonalization so that I don't get to the point of trying to slash my wrists again.",08Nov2020,1
211,"hello, it is a bit complicated.

due to childhood trauma i have severe commitment issues and a sexual dysfunction. last year i got into a relationship and everything was perfect but after a little disagreement my commitment issues started to kick in and ever since i’ve always started to distance myself from my boyfriend and was really mean to him because i couldn’t handle intimacy and being close to him for no reason. it was an on-off-relationship, really hot and cold, because as soon as he started to distance too because he couldn’t handle me anymore, i started to get VERY clingy and wanted to be close to him again. and when he agreed to try again, i got distanced again lol. it’s a never ending cycle. and i KNOW i am the toxic one, y’all don’t need to tell me. i really want to change and i even went to therapy. at the moment my boyfriend is really cold to me, is barely texting me and never wants to meet up (this week we only saw each other for an hour...). he said he still loves me but at the moment he can’t give me another chance. he would only try again, if it was for sure that i am healed and my commitment issues are gone. idk why i’m sharing all of this. idk how to heal, i’ve been reading so much, meditating, seeked  therapy and nothing seems to work. i am so upset and my mental health is not the best at the moment. i just feel so empty and wanted to share. i love him so much but as soon as we get close, it’s almost as if i hate him. why can’t i control this part of me? i hate it here. what would you do if you were me?",08Nov2020,1
212,"To make a long story short, I intentionally amputated one of my fingers with a power saw about six months ago. I lied to everyone about it, pretended it was an accident, and life resumed as usual.


I was diagnosed as schizoaffective four years ago after a psychological evaluation. I plan on giving him a copy of the psych eval.

I have visual and auditory hallucinations and constant violent fantasies about inflicting serious injury and mutilation on myself and other people. Would I actually do it? I don’t think so, but then again I also cut off one of my fingers with little thought to the consequences, and then spent the better part of three weeks trying to get it infected after it was surgically reattached so it would be amputated. Why? I don’t know. That’s why I’m re-enrolling in therapy.


My question is: How much of this should I reveal to my psychologist? It seems like an awful lot to shove on someone’s plate for a first visit and I’m not too keen on getting involuntarily hospitalized. Before someone says this is exactly what I need- I’ve been dealing just fine on my own for the past six months without incident thus far. I don’t think getting myself committed is the right move as it would severely impact my job- as in I would definitely get fired.


All that being said I am slightly excited to reveal at least some of this to another person as I haven’t had anyone to tell it to for obvious reasons. At the very least, I’ll probably be the most interesting person he’s seen that day.",08Nov2020,1
213,"Like I feel like life has just been irreparably... ruined for me at this point.

I mean maybe there was a point where I was able to look at what I had around me and say “hey, maybe I can make this work” ...but now that just isn’t really the case.

I just don’t really want to deal with anything anymore. I mean it’s shitty to say that, but honestly... I just don’t have the motivation right now to do anything except the bare minimum for what it would take for other people not to suffer from the consequences of my actions, of from my lack thereof. I’m not really living I guess. Just doing what it takes not to be a burden and to keep things from falling apart, like I always have been. There’s no me.

I think I’m gonna be dead at like 40. In my 21 years of being alive I’ve been breaking my back just trying to make sure nothing bad happens. There’s been too much pointless yelling and hostility, too many disappointments, too many cold-sweat panic attacks in the middle of the night, just so much goddamn fear, so much goddamn guilt... and I mean I’ve already dropped from it once, nearly twice. There became a point where I honestly hit my limit and literally lost consciousness in the middle of class and had to be hospitalized. I mean it was classified as a panic attack with no long term ramifications... but what’s next? A heart attack? A stroke? It’ll probably vary as I get older.

And all this for what? It’s not like I’ve ever had time to develop any worthwhile hobbies, make any legitimate achievements, or do something else that would make life worth it like make friends during all of this. I had to give that shit up at the age of 11 because I came to the ugly realization that I was simply never going to have time for it.

The only thing that keeps me going is simple curiosity and the awareness that my death would *cause* problems to people besides myself, which is something I refuse to do.

I feel like all my stupid life ever does is use me up and never give anything back.... and honestly that’s fair, because I get that life isn’t inherently fair. I just wish I had a singular source of pride, joy, or... comfort? ...I guess.

Also I’m used to it whenever I try to get help and it just doesn’t fucking work. Sometimes I wonder if my therapists just reach a point where they look at me and think “shit, this person really is unhelpable”.

The thing about me is I try to make things perfect. My entire life I have tried to be good enough just to make my home life work and to not feel like a piece of shit all the time... but surprise! It never worked.

They say get out if you’re depressed, talk to people, but really the only place I’m willing to be a toxic, gloomy burden, spewing my endless wealth of festering negativity is here on the internet where I can just be nothing more than some anonymous asshole who you don’t actually have to deal with in real life.

I mean holy shit. Actually attempting human relationships right now would be an utter train wreck but it’s not like I’m gonna get better alone... so is the moral choice to keep my mouth shut to spare everyone else the inconvenience of exposure to my toxic depressive nature while allowing myself to grow worse and... as much as I absolutely hate this... *continuing* to hurt people despite all my efforts because every so often some misguided individual will reach out to me only to be met by the coldness and apathy I only seem to be capable of now?

I’m like a human inconvenience factory. My benefit to this earth has probably only been varying degrees of negative.... and *especially* right now because maybe by partaking in this long pointless internet rambles about how hopeless I feel, I actually convince somebody *else* to commit suicide.

Maybe if I could just figure out how to not be an utter shitstain on the face of the earth wherever I go, I could manage to be happy. God I’m a fucking idiot. Maybe I have an obsession with being perfect and it is what’s driving me and everyone around me into a miserable spiral... but lord help me if simply *addressing* that is gonna help.

I’ve tried so many hobbies, so many goddamn religions, so many philosophies, and I have forced myself to become *so many different people* maintaining the slimmest margin of hope that something might actually stick for once.

Anyway. Sorry this thing was so long. If anyone actually reads this entire thing... thank you and I’m sorry for what you’ve had to read. Have a nice day.",08Nov2020,1
214,"Hi,

it's pretty obvious that I will spend this christmas alone. The major reason being that I almost do not have any living relatives anymore, the other being that there will be most likely a lockdown in effect over christmas in most parts of europe. I've become very lonely this year, which is no surprise to anyone, I'm sure some of you can relate. So, in preparation of the ""hardest time of the year"", I wanted to plan something nice for me this year. But... as mostly everything is closed down, I'm not sure how I should go about it. I'll have an amazong meal, of course, I'll also bake some cookies. A friend nudged me to get an advent-calendar this year. I wanted to exchange gifts with someone, but sending cool packages to my friends all year and not receiving one myself on my birthday was kinda dissappointing, so I don't want to do that anymore. I thought about buying a bunch of toys for a kindergarten so I can see some happy people around me... Which sounds super pathic and sad, but... Yeah.

Anyway, I'd be really happy if anyone has an idea of how I can plan a week with stuff over the hollidays all alone.

Is Text-Based Therapy Effective?
----

Elizabeth Yuko
Friday 5:30PM


Living with mental illness looks different for everyone, but for many people, there are periods of time when your anxiety and/or depression symptoms are worse than others. One minute I’ll be typing away feeling neutral, and then the feelings start trickling in. (I picture it being like that older couple in bed together in Titanic who are stuck there, just watching the room fill with water, knowing they’re going to die...which probably doesn’t help with the depression.)



Even coming from a place of privilege when it comes to mental health, where I get the therapy and medication I need, there are still times when everything feels too overwhelming and I wish I could text my therapist right then and there (but I don’t). Sometimes, though, I use free online text/chat therapy services, and whether or not it was a licensed human therapist on the other end or some type of AI chatbot, it has helped.


But what about having regular therapy appointments via text or chat? Is that effective, or even a good idea? Could it be an option for the many people who are dealing with mental health issues for the first time during the pandemic and are new to navigating all of this? We spoke with several mental health experts to find out.


Illustration for article titled Is Text-Based Therapy Effective?
I Actually Kind of Love My Chatbot Therapist
We last checked in with Woebot when it was just a baby chatbot, operating within Facebook Messenger



**What is text- and chat-based therapy?**
First of all, the term “therapy” can mean many different things for people. The kind we’ll be discussing here involves having a conversation with a trained professional (or computer) regarding your mental health. Instead of seeing a therapist face-to-face (either in-person, or through teletherapy), the client and therapist exchange messages through text or online chat. We’ll touch on both text/chat-based therapy with an actual licensed human therapist on the other end, as well as the kind where the “therapist” is an AI-operated chatbot.



**What are the potential benefits?**
Before we get into the risks and limitations of this form of therapy, let’s look at some of the potential ways it can help.



**Accessibility and convenience**
The biggest benefit of text- and chat-based therapy (with both humans and chatbots) is accessibility. “Text-based therapy may reach more patients because of reduced constraints on time, money, and location,” Dr. Sabrina Romanoff, a clinical psychologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, tells Lifehacker.

This is especially true now during the pandemic, because you don’t need to leave your home or find a local therapist who accepts your insurance (or has sliding-scale payments) and is currently taking new patients. Pandemic or not, it’s also useful for those who live in an area where therapy is simply not available. And, as Romanoff points out, in cases involving a chatbot, the service is available around the clock when you need it.


**Affordability**
Text- and chat-based therapy can be a way to access mental health support for those who otherwise wouldn’t be able to afford it. “Apps and chats are fairly inexpensive with low monthly fees or unlimited messaging,” Dr. Scott Guerin, a developmental psychologist and adjunct professor in psychology at Kean University, tells Lifehacker. “Even with copays, live sessions can be costly.”

**Intro to therapy**
If you’ve been curious about therapy in general and want to get a feel for having those types of conversations, text- and chat-based therapy could be a way to do that. “It can be an opportunity for individuals to dip their toes into the therapy pool, and motivate them to seek out the real thing,” Romanoff says.



**Some people prefer writing/typing**
We’ve reached a point where, for many people, communicating through text message, email, or online chat has become the norm. Even if you didn’t grow up learning how to process your feelings via texting and typing, you may have gotten so used to it that you’re now more comfortable over text than you are on a phone call. In fact, for some people, phone calls themselves are sources of anxiety. Those in that category might prefer to do therapy in the same way.


Along the same lines, Romanoff explains that some people are better able to process their emotions by writing (or in this case, typing) them out. But if that’s the aspect that helps you the most, she says that writing in a journal may be more effective.



**Does Teletherapy Work?**
One of the most wide-reaching side effects of COVID-19 has been its impact on mental health.…


**What are the potential risks or limitations?**
When making any kind of decision about your mental or physical health, it’s helpful to weigh both the possible pros and cons of your options to see which come out on top. These risks and limitations of text- and chat-based therapy aren’t another way of saying “this is dangerous, don’t do this,” but some things to consider while you’re deciding.



**Developing a specific care plan**
Before starting in-person therapy sessions, you’ll likely have some type of intake evaluation to help both you and the mental health professional you’re working with identify the areas you need to focus on, and then develop a care plan specific to your needs.


“There are many types of therapy and the only way to know which one would be right for you would be to speak with a mental health professional who can ascertain what could be most helpful,” Dr. Georgia Gaveras, co-founder and chief psychiatrist for Talkiatry, tells Lifehacker. “This may very well be a chat-based service, but for many others, it might not be enough.”


**Lack of facial cues and tone**
Like any form of written communication, things can get lost in translation during text- and chat-based therapy, given that it doesn’t provide the opportunity to pick up on facial cues and someone’s tone.


“It is critical to understand that even in these times where digital communication is the norm, it is still estimated that 70 to 93 percent of in-person communication is non-verbal,” Guerin says. “That is, reading the client’s body language, glances, frown, furrowed brow, smile, hand gestures, and eye contact provides an enormous amount of information to the clinician as they assess the client, their issue and develop a therapeutic plan.”


The lack of these cues can be particularly problematic when someone’s words do not match up with their thoughts, according to Romanoff. This could happen in situations when patients are concealing important information—a difference Romanoff says therapists can more likely discern in person, but not through text. “This is especially true for high-risk populations, like individuals struggling with suicide, abuse, or substances.”

And, as Gaveras points out, it’s not only the absence of the facial cues and tone people use when describing a situation—there are also other physical clues therapists use to assess how a patient is doing overall. “For example, if you cut your arm but the doctor couldn’t see it, it would be incredibly difficult for the doctor to determine how bad it is,” she explains. “Similarly, in psychiatry, we learn a lot about someone through body language and facial expressions. We can see how someone has been able to care for him- or herself physically, if they are biting their nails, talking to themselves, or welling up with tears.”


It can also make a difference to the person on the receiving end of therapy. “Either during a scheduled session or a crisis contact, how someone says something is as important as what they say, and this can be difficult to ascertain through a text, and certainly using only AI,” Gaveras explains.

For example, someone with anxiety who catastrophizes everything might see a period at the end of a message from their therapist and read it as being aggressive (when that’s very unlikely the case), which could make them feel even more anxious and worry about whether they’ve offended the therapist or chatbot (don’t judge if you haven’t been there).


**Authenticity**
For Romanoff, there’s also the issue of authenticity. “In in-person therapy, we encourage patients to engage in free association—to open the gates of the mind without filters—and editing that goes into other types of communications,” she explains. “Texting brings those walls right up. The mechanism of thinking out a response, typing it, viewing it on the screen contextualized by the earlier conversation leaves very little authentic reaction, [and] instead, more self-editing and censoring processes are at work than if those same thoughts were communicated by speech.”


**The missing human connection**
In therapy involving AI-operated chatbots, not only are you dealing with all of the above, but there are also challenges that could come from the fact that you’re communicating with a computer, rather than a human person. “It takes a lot of vulnerability and effort to begin the process of therapy,” Romanoff says. “It is not easy to inhabit the patient role.”

For some people, therapy includes opening up about parts of their past that haunt them the most—things they may not have even discussed with those closest to them. This is another case of people needing and wanting different things out of therapy. For some people, telling their deepest secrets and fears to a computer program instead of a human therapist might make the process easier. Similarly, there may be individuals who find simply letting go of something the most useful part of therapy—regardless of who is or isn’t on the other end of the conversation.



But for others, human connection—even just over text or chat—is a crucial part of the process. “Being fully seen, heard, and withstanding that pain in the presence of another person is one of the most curative and comforting aspects of therapy,” Romanoff explains. “There is a great loss when considering the conduct of therapy among humans and robots. Robots cannot take in our experiences the way we need them to.”



**The time lag in communication**
For some, text- or chat-based therapy may not be as effective as in-person sessions because of the time lag in communication, which Romanoff says can disrupt the flow of the work. “Part of what makes therapy so effective is the emotional intensity that corresponds with the words. This is missing through text,” she explains.

And while most people go into this type of therapy expecting it to feel like a text conversation, according to Romanoff, in reality it usually tends to feel like an email correspondence. “This prolonged time gap between responses loses the emotional tone and salience that was present in the moment,” she says. “Therefore, the person is reading the response through a completely different lens, midpoint, and perspective when there is a delay, compared to when the message was originally sent.”



**It requires trust**
With everything we know about data and privacy, it’s understandable if you feel hesitant—maybe even suspicious—of therapy where you have to trust that the person (or bot) on the other end is who they say they are, including having all the necessary qualifications.


“Ethically, I think that anyone entering any type of therapeutic relationship should be confident that the space will be safe, and their privacy will be protected,” Gaveras says. “Any chat-based service should go above and beyond to ensure that it offers the highest level of security to its clients.” This means doing a little homework before selecting a site or provider (we’ll get to that in a minute).

If you feel like you’re struggling with your mental health, you’re not alone. Many of us are…


Is text- and chat-based therapy effective?
At this point, you’ve probably figured out that it all depends on a person’s individual needs, and how they’re best able to express themselves and experience the benefits of therapy.

According to Guerin, text- and chat-based therapy can work well for people with mild symptoms, or with those who have been through in-depth counseling sessions and can use them as maintenance or supportive sessions. Similarly, Gaveras says that she can see text- and chat-based therapy being a useful supplement for those who are also in more traditional forms of therapy, especially for those engaged in certain treatments for anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

But Guerin says that doesn’t mean that text- and chat-based therapy is a good option for everyone. “I do not think this type of therapy is appropriate for those with serious or long-term issues, for people who have been hospitalized in the past for behavioral/emotional problems, or for those who require regular medication in order to maintain a stable life,” he notes.

This is especially a concern for people with more complex diagnoses or symptoms who opt for chatbot therapy, Romanoff says. That’s because it is often provided in the form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions—which may not be the best option for everyone.


“These are treatments guided through manuals, and have been found to be most effective for folks with ‘cookie-cutter’ clinical presentations,” she explains. “That means individuals with no preexisting conditions, premorbid or co-existing disorders, and relatively straightforward clinical cases. The reality is that no one is that simple, and there lies the beauty of the work. This is the main drawback of CBT, and is only further exacerbated online.”

Ultimately, Gaveras is optimistic about the possibilities for text- and chat-based therapy, but says we have to get a better understanding of it first. “There have been some studies on these chat-based services which have had their limitations in size and scope, but they are promising,” she says, “and it is absolutely something that should be explored further.”






**How to pick a text-or chat-based service provider**
If you’re interested in text- or chat-based therapy but aren’t sure where or how to find a provider that fits your needs, Guerin offers the following tips:


Look for a provider that uses licensed therapists with at least a masters degree or PhD. Make sure they are affiliated with an established and reputable company. Check out their academic background to verify their degree is from an accredited college or university.


Look for a service or provider that has experience with what you are looking to address—depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, etc.—and has experience with people like you: younger, older, college students, retired, etc.
Understand how the service works, including their scheduled times for interactions, whether a monthly plan is limited or unlimited, its cost, and the length of sessions.
Beware of any long-term contracts or financial commitments.
Make sure providers and services have a clearly stated confidentiality agreement and statement (i.e. being HIPAA compliant), and that they do not to use your information for anything else or give it to anyone. This is a must, to protect your privacy.
Look for how they support people who have serious problems. Do they offer emergency phone consultations or services? What does someone do if they have feelings about harming themselves or others?
Like in-person therapy, it may take a bit of trial and error to find a service or provider that’s a good fit for you.

223,"After coming out of sexually abusive relationship, I cannot handle physical touch or being in a closed room alone. I feel so uncomfortable when anyone is in my room, even my family member. I live in a two story house and the 2nd floor recently got remodeled out of nowhere.  I have been living alone in 2nd floor for about a year now so you can guess my surprise when I came back from school one day and the whole floor was refurnished and decorated.  After the remodeling, my family members have been spending their whole entire days there (spending 8-10 hours), 8 ft away from my room. Not being able to obtain peace and quietness has been making me extra aggressive and sensitive. Knowing that someone is so close to me for 8-10 hours a day is so mentally draining. I live in a super secluded area so I can't just pack up and walk down to Starbucks to study or relax. I can leave but I have nowehere to go.

When I asked my family if they could gradually increase their time spent upstairs, they were upset with me. I asked if they could spend 5 hours upstairs this week, 6 hours next week, etc, and they said, ""It's unfair how we can't just stay here for however long we want"". Annnnnd I kind of agree. They shouldn't have to accomodate for me but I can't stop feeling so threatened and scared that I am not alone in 2nd floor for long periods of time.  I used to be okay with things like this but ever since being diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, I can't stop hating people in my ""personal space"".

224,"Ripped straight from my relationship advice post in case you guys have a better idea.

Pretty sure non of my family use Reddit but can never be too safe
Tdlr at the bottom

First let me fill you in on some details:

This is all in the UK, so lockdown n stuff is a key part in this. Throughout this we’ve followed all the rules to the t, due to my Pops’ dad being quite at risk.

Me - 2nd year university student living away from home

Bro - my younger brother who is 16 years of age, he wears his heart on his sleeve, very quick to react to say what he thinks is right, but also more brawn than brains bless him. He is an apprentice athlete doing a sport to a pretty damn good level.

Mum n Pops - both work full time at home (lockdown duh), my dad recently made redundant from covid and has gone into a new business. Previously my dad was a professional sportsman but he to retire early due to injury (which is why he now has to work full time instead)

GF - 16 year old, has been to A&amp;E in the past for overdosing and suffers from depression and I think also anxiety


Right ok

So around 7 months ago my brother got into a relationship with GF, a few weeks after breaking up with his first love. At this point we were in the first lockdown (I think?) and I was still at home after my first year.
They were quick to progress with their relationship, and before long we were introduced to her through the proper outside meets etc. She seemed nice, but because I didn’t expect it to last very long I kept my distance.

Before long we noticed that my bro had become more aggressive (which we dubbed to puberty) and more reluctant towards his chosen profession. He wanted to spent time with his GF rather than train.

After a few arguments about my brothers priorities, my parents found that GF had been telling my Bro that was pointless for him to train and follow his dream of being an athlete; and that my Pops was just pushing his dreams onto my Bro. 
This made me sick in the stomach, what a barefaced lie - my father is a very emotional person, but he would never push his own goals upon to anyone in our family, never. Proof of this is the freedom me and my Bro have both been given to do whatever we like, provided we do said thing to 100% - that’s how we’ve been brought up.

When lockdown gets released, we find that GF is very controlling over my Bro, being angry that he’s taken away to do his apprenticeship, and throwing tantrums when she doesn’t get her own way - even if it is in front of us.

Fast forward to recently: I’m living at university, my parents and bro at home in the new lockdown.
My brother and GF don’t understand that they cannot see each other - especially with the contract requirements of his profession.
It explodes and ends multiple nights with Gf and her mother at our door - to the forbidding of my Pops. Multiple tantrums and arguments between my family and GF’s family later (I should mention my Bro isn’t on a side at this point) and it’s agreed they will set up a zoom meeting to work it out. 
At this point my mother makes it very clear she doesn’t want my Bro to have anything to do with GF and her family - that she is bad news. We learn that GF has been texting my mother behind my Bros back, sending horrible messages telling her that she is a bad mum etc. 
My Bro begins to agree and says that he’s been feeling he’s had enough of her.

Come to the day of the meeting, phone call to my Bro comes in “GF has drunken bleach and is in an ambulance on the way to the hospital”. After visiting GF in hospital my Bro and family argue about her. My mother trying to explain to my Bro that she is not mentally ok, and she will only bring harm to him. My Bro says that he still loves her, and doesn’t want to leave her.
In the end, my mother gave my Bro an ultimatum: take a break from GF, or leave the house to live with her during lockdown.
After another argument, my Bro packs some bags and leaves.

That happened today, and a few hours after our older cousin visited my Bro, took him out for a ride to see our niece. He tried to chat to see how my Bro felt about everything, and found that my Bro does agree that she is mentally unstable, however he still loves her and can’t let her go so easily. 
He is still staying the night at GF, and I don’t know what is going to happen in the morning.

Onto a little of me. I feel so powerless, I cannot be there to see this for myself so I am currently some spectator. I rang my brother a few days ago (after first finding out about this) to see how he was, and he seemed fine. Our relationship is a good one, however it’s never been too emotional; the brotherly love sure is there but it seems to be field by mutual respect, but I wouldn’t say that we are very close - we have different interests are good at different things etc.

I’m just looking for advice, any advice. I personally been looking to see if I can get GF taken to a psychiatric hospital to get the help she clearly needs. But what can I do? I want my Bro to be happy but it seems that GF has dug her claws in deep. 
Obviously take this all with a grain of salt - I have never really liked this girl, nor her family so there is definitely at least some bias.

TL;DR: My Bro goes out with GF, she manipulates him into arguing with my parents and changes his priorities for the worse. She is mentally unstable, help?",08Nov2020,1

I’ve conditioned myself into just sitting on my phone because every time I close my eyes at night, I get the same thoughts. I can’t actually fall asleep, it’s always me waiting until I get so tired that I my eyes just close on their own so I can skip over the bad parts. Is there a way I can fix this?

229,"how is someone supposed to bounce back from this .    to start my story i was born with ADHD and a learning disability with a mother with a narcissistic personality disorder. yes, I know rough start i, fortunately, had both parents but dad was too busy trying to keep up a roof over our heads so i never questioned it ( it matters latter in the story that i understood his hard work at such a young age ) . as anyone would know having a mother that only cares about her self and a learning disability, and eating disorder i was bullied I was convinced i was stupid and fat whole life ( i ate to heal my heart )  . i had the local kids beat me to a bloody pulp and steal my new bike or what ever i got new .  as i struggled i watched at my golden child sister was helt on a different standard she got everything she was taught to read write everything and i was told im too stupid to learn that stuff . my sister did however deal with the typical golden child abuse, stupid me only knew one thing protect and survive . of everything i learned from my dad was protect the women in your life so i did i took every beating that was ment for her and fought my mom with fists to keep her from hurting my sister   ( killed me inside ) .  

all thoses issues of course would slap the day lights out of me when of course i was out for a work gathering at a local bar where i came across an old ex prom date , we got chatting i we ended up going back to my place where i found out she was not a very nice girl when she drank. after we finished sex she wasnt finished yet and she started making rude and desperate comments where i said i think its best you go ( boom ) she suckers me like no tommorow i lightly help her leave at that point ......

unfortunately  it didnt end there i met up with her 2 years later same bar , i buy her what ever she was drinking she was with another male at the bar and she begins to hit on my and ask me to take her home again ..... stunned thinking ummm 1-you have a date 2-i told her shes not good enough for me anymore ( boom ) she suckered me and kept hitting my face till my front teeth were in my hand ( to this day i still dont have it in me to hit her back ) . i look at the bouncer front teeth in hand in what should of been the worst pain of my life and said can you get the cops here . shes then booked slammed her face on the cop car she began to fight the cops helping my case . where it gets weird is when i was in questioning for victem impact the cop looked at me cluelessly asking "" why didnt you fight back "" i looked him in the eyes and said "" because should wouldnt of got back up "" the convorsation ended right there .   (she was charged with assault causing bodly harm and 10 year booze ban ) i felt that was fair justice but it instilled my fear that everywomen is abusive . 

i grew older and became a big boy juice head  , i was a brick shit house i scared people and became the anti bully . i was the guy who fucked people up downtown who would drag there gf around or pick on people  . it was so depressing all i knew was to protect women and vulernable people ..... well one day that got my arrested i beat some child abuser with a sledgehammer  which created alot of legal issues so i lost my career in a bodyshop  ( had a job at a car dealer body shop ) .

230,"Hey all!  


So currently, I am feeling a bit empty. NOT super sad or anything super dark like suicide, or things on that level.

  
I'm doing perfectly fine, I eat as well as I can, and I am exercising on a regular schedule, and I hang out with friends whenever I can (just hung out with someone yesterday evening).  


My roommate won't return until mid-January so I have the entire place to myself.

I just came back from a month-long business trip related to the election, so I just came home to an empty apartment (while being aware that I would be, of course--roommate told me he'd be gone during the middle of the time I was away myself).  


I've noticed that I've been feeling tired out of nowhere (I don't know if I feel fatigued, so I won't say that just yet) when I'm going about my daily routine at home (I work at home), but I'm not particularly feeling lonely or self-conscious about being alone, if anything I feel fine and normal--again, maybe a little empty and bored, but that's it.

I’ve watched videos of myself as a child, I was Lively, Courageous, Social and Proud. I’m not that kid anymore, I haven’t been for a long time. I struggle to figure out where everything went wrong, why I am the way I am today, but I’m at a loss. 

I’ve tried counseling, medication, IOP treatment. But nothing seems to stick. I figure maybe I’m just so used to being down that I being up and better makes me uncomfortable. They do say that if you’re not uncomfortable, you’re not progressing. 

My next effort for my mental health is truing a change of environment. I’m moving from my hometown of Milwaukee to Houston. I can admit part of it is me trying to escape all the people who know me here. For some, I’m not a nice person. For others, I’m just weird. For some, I’m a nobody. Oddly enough, I think it’s that last one that hurts me most. I come from a huge family and I find myself drifting away from my family in my room at family events. I’m not sure what’s worse feeling lonely in a room full of people or feeling lonely while actually being alone. 

I think I go through severe Psychosis when I’m alone though. I talk to myself. I’ve even developed another life in my head. I find myself physically talking or at least mouthing things as if I’m talking to a person right in front of me. I can’t stop it. It’s how I cope with the loneliness. So maybe that one’s worse. But, both scenarios bring me down.

234,"Well, to get to the point. Ever since I was 9 (I'm 17 now) I've always struggled with suicidal thoughts,anxiety, and depression... But as of recent, as in the past 4 years. Its been way more turbulent and less consistent. Like usually I'm good for around 2 weeks-3 months where I'll be content or numb. But something will happen and I'll go back to the worst of it for around 2 months. But its never consistent even with that, sometimes my moods change at LEAST 4 times an hour for no reason and they're always super intense. Like the other night I was very driven to workout for at least an hour to lose weight (I have multiple eating disorders), and then halfway through I just dropped and started sobbing uncontrollably, it lasted around 2 hours and I really wanted to self harm, but instead during those moments I was scratching and pinching myself excessively (I haven't cut in almost three months, but I used to really badly). Then after that ended I went completely numb and couldn't barely move until I feel asleep at 4 AM... Another thing is, I went to a Doctor a year ago because my mom wanted to test if I was pregnant (I wasn't), and the doctor gave a brief mental assessment and tried to encourage my mother to put me on Zoloft? I think that's the name of it... But my mom went apeshit and refused and when we got home, I asked why she wouldn't let me take them and she started screaming at me and saying "" I don't need a drug addicted daughter, you just need therapy and to pray, I refuse to put you on drugs to help you"". Note shes EXTREMELY christian and very Anti vax, I'm an atheist and due to that she constantly puts me down and condemns me because of it... Moving on, she set me up with a very Christian therapist and the therapist recommended I get a psych eval for Bipolar disorder to see if my treatment needed to be medication based. My mom refused once more and just thinks I'm moody like a regular teen or have a hormonal imbalance.

I don't know if I'm bipolar or if I'm borderline, I've done loads of research because I always have this deep ache to figure out whats wrong with me because I can't escape it, and I'm getting worse by the day. I suddenly have moments where I'm enraged over the littlest things and start fights with my mom or cousins, or I have very intense suicidal moments that the only reason I can't actually end it is because my mom never leaves me home alone, I used to never have anger issues. I attempted once before with a shit ton of Tylenol and like 5 hydrocodones that I had leftover from my surgery(I had my gallbladder removed), but I just got really sick for about a week and my mom never knew. I just don't know if I can take much more of this, everyday I wake up either angry or depressed and it never lasts, I have no security in myself or anything. I also obsessively everyday puke up everything I eat or starve completely because I'm very paranoid about my weight and obesity because I don't believe I'll ever be worth anything unless others see me as attractive or worthwhile. It also doesn't help that I had my first relationship and first everything earlier this year and he cheated on me multiple times with someone who weighed 90lbs and was completely opposite of me, No shame on her she actually was nice, but it really fucked with my head and I still haven't gotten over it because I just feel worthless, like if he couldn't even love me the way I am who ever would.... After my parents found out about my relationship they shamed me and called me a whore and bullied me about it, and spread it to everyone at the church they attend. I just can't escape it because every time I see any of my other family they just look down on me and avoid me like the plague, my grandmother hasn't even spoken to me in a year... I just want to know whats wrong with me and get the help I so badly need... Because I dreamed of being a surgeon since I was a child but at this rate I'm not going to make it to 20.... I just want to either die or be fixed...

236,"I've never once used Reddit, but I have used it many times to find help with certain games and topics of conversation. Today, I have decided to join even if it is momentarily to ask for your help personally...

I'm almost 30 years old, male, unemployed, living in Spain, and currently back in the same apartment as my mother. I'm one of those fabled wastes of space that sits around all day watching anime and videogames because the real world is too scary and painful. This is, of course, causing great pain to my mother who is a saint and who does her best to keep us going with her pension. The truth is, though, that I've had suicidal thoughts for as long as I can remember. They were mild at first, but over time and with each failed attempt at independence (3 so far) it has been harder and harder to resist those urges. Finally, I met someone who I thought and feel still is my soulmate who I pushed away due to how fragile my own mental health is. Before you suggest this, no I will not be reaching out to let them know how I feel. They know, and they have a lot to deal with and I vowed never to cause them any more grief. This was the last straw that broke the camel's mind, however, and I now find myself unable to envision the future. I've always felt detached from myself, suffering from depersonalization disorder perhaps, or just plain old depression. This has happened for as long as I can remember, and mental health professionals have only ever prescribed me pills with terrible side-effects that I've seen ruin other people. Through this, I realize that I simply am not cut out to live in this world and, as a firm believer of natural selection, know that the best option is simply to remove myself. It's my dream, and my greatest desire, but taking the final step is difficult.

... So, internet, please. Give me the brutal honesty that I've always loved in you and please tell me how much of a useless piece of trash I am and that I need to end it. Don't tell me to keep going, don't remind me how it'll make people around me sad, don't tell me to seek professional help. I've explored those things already and know there is only one way, and so do you knowing what I have described before. Please confirm what these voices keep telling me and tell me to end it.",08Nov2020,1
237,"When I get to know people, they will often tell me at some point that they have very dark thoughts. I use this opportunity to let them know that I do as well. When I tell them my thoughts, they almost always respond with, ""Man, you need to seek some professional help for that."" I don't even get to hear their thoughts at that point. I have been going to therapy for about 6 years now and am currently seeing 3 different therapists. One of my therapists, who has been in the profession for nearly 20 years, told me that I have some of the darkest thoughts he's ever heard. I won't go into details here because apparently, I need to be keeping these thoughts to myself. What exactly do most people mean when they say they have dark thoughts?",08Nov2020,1

242,"My brother is the reason I'm the depressed and anxious mess I am today.

I lived with him from birth until about 17, which is when certain circumstances forced my family to live in separate places and it's been like that ever since. I now live with my boyfriend and his mom, but due to the fact that she completely hates my guts and abuses the both of us, we're now trying to move out and the only person in a position to help is my brother and his wife, who happens to be my best friend (don't even get me started on how it feels for your best friend to fall in love with your abusive brother). I thought I was finally free, that I wouldn't have to live with him ever again, but now I have no choice.

My entire childhood was filled with him screaming at me, telling me that I'm a worthless bitch or cunt, that nobody cares about me, hitting me and even whipping me with a blanket, and so many other things. He and my sister would gang up on me and make me feel absolutely worthless. They would tell me I was adopted and that's why I was so weird and different from everyone else. I don't know why he targeted me. Maybe because I'm the youngest? I cried everyday and prayed that somehow CPS or something would magically take me away so I could be away from him and not be so scared anymore. I remember just hearing him walk around would make my stomach drop and heart race. My pent up anxiety really came to a head during my early-mid teens and I developed panic attacks and would faint from stress whenever there was a big fight, and I'd often have night terrors reliving what he'd done. 

One of the worst things is that even though my friend knew what he was doing even while it was happening, because she's one of those ""every guy can be fixed by my love"" girls she decided to get involved with him anyway. She tells me that he's changed and that I have nothing to worry about but of course she would say that. Every now and then she texts me that he's being an asshole and she describes the exact things he used to do to me. 
I feel bad for her but at the same time it's kind of like... well wtf did you expect from what I told you? 

I'm so conflicted. I know he isn't the exact same person he was back then and that he genuinely does want to help, but the trauma and memories are there. The anxiety and deep dissatisfaction with myself from years of being told I'm defective is there. I haven't been to therapy or anything for this and don't see myself doing so anytime soon since they live in the middle of nowhere. How am I supposed to be okay with being thrown right back into hell? I'm so scared and I can't talk about it to anyone who knows him because they 
didn't experience what I did. There are no good options.


TL;DR: Moving back in with my abusive brother who gave me CPTSD, and I'm just so scared.",08Nov2020,1
243,"My mental health hasn't been the best in the past years. Somehow this really affected my way of walking and now my knees are totally fucked.
 I literally can't stretch my legs and when I walk my legs are legs always are bend in a really weird angle.

 At first only my parents told me to go normal,then some friends pointed it out and it got even worse over time. I see a lot of people laughing about it when I'm in public places (or at least I think they are). There was a time where I'd have considered myself almost fully recovered,my anxiety never was that bad but it really pulled down my mental health and my self esteem.

 Whenever I'm in school or anywhere with more than a couple people I almost get a panic attack. I try to focus on the way I walk but it only end up looking even weirder. I don't know when I ever thought I had a positive appearance but this shit really shattered everything that was left of my self esteem. I can't really talk to people except for good friends and no matter where I'm at I always think about how people think what a total weirdo I am. Unfortunately when I get anxious about these things I'm acting even more weird. 

Yesterday I self harmed for the first time in one and a half year and I'm really scared that I'll go back into full depression if things don't change. Also seasonal depression might play a part as things got progressively worse the last few months.

I don't know who would read this and why,there's not even a question or anything,just a little rant. Either way thanks for reading.",08Nov2020,1
244,"I have a few... but my big 3 are panic disorder with agoraphobia, Major Depressive disorder, and PTSD.

Since being with my current partner my panic attacks and depression no longer rule the roost. However that seems to have made way for the PTSD to take over. The first 2 months of our relationship was plagued with my night terrors (and all that that implies) and me waking up in the middle of calling his name before I even opened my eyes (which is very new. Never called out for anyone before) 
Yesterday i had an episode. A thing that I would rather forget of course. I have remembered this before and it didn't bother me so much but yesterday, for no reason, it came crashing to the surface and insist on staying there. I wanted to die and nothing could make it go away. I was also alone because my partner was at work. It took a few hours of crying and failed distractions for it to stop but it finally did. I have meds for this or at least I would but being 31 weeks I can't take anything nor do I want to. Although my doctor did say that, in the absence of my seroquel, benadryl was a good idea because "" you cant have an episode if you're in a coma!"" 

When the PTSD isn't holding me hostage like this I will have days where I am just... dissociative I guess most days. But I will have days its battle royal and it's not even me vs my brain. It's the panic vs depression vs pts. My body gets heavy and lethargic like we're depressed. My brain however is RACING like Forrest Gump on crack trying to come up with something to worry about.  and my PTSD is just preventing me from doing anything about anything.

245,"I know it’s a loaded question but I really don’t have an idea where to start. I feel like so much of my identity is defined by insecurity and anxiety. My behaviors and personality are always based on others (my older brother to gain his respect, friends to make me more appealing, etc.), and it’s almost like I change who I am based on who I’m with. I suppose this would be fine if I was happy, but I never feel like any of my friendships are close or intimate, and I’ve never had a romantic partner. I wonder if this lack of intimacy is because I’m not being “myself.” When I’m alone, I’m only angry, confused and scared. I don’t feel like that’s the real me either. 

I just want to feel like my identity is consistent, genuine, and satisfying for me to live with. But I don’t know how much of myself has to be built from the ground-up, and as an adult (22) the idea of changing in a potentially radical way is daunting. How can I begin going about this process?

250,"I am 25F  in the military. This may sound like a victim post.. but I'm trying really hard not to make it sound like that, and if it is please tell me I'm actually the huge piece of shit that I am

I have a very difficult time keeping friends. I figured and was diagnosed with Borderline personality disorder, if you don't know.. it has a lot to do with periods of time of extreme unpredictable moods.. I realized recently(not diagnosed) that I have narcissistic traits which I think plays into everything I'm about to unravel

I am also very drunk. I am almost finished with a deep red, wine while sitting in my closet that is situated behind a dryer in my house so, my sibling can't hear. 

 Anyways, every since my diagnosis of BPD years ago, I have tried really hard to improve on my behavior. I notice that I can be easily manipulative with out even trying. But I also care so deeply about everyone around me. And, recently(last week) I was wondering why I don't have many long term friends. And I wanted to analyze more of my behavior. I noticed a real bad superiority complex which is hard for me to turn of.. and honestly I hate it so much.. if certain people talked to me I feel like I disassociate and was rude(I was) trying to not be seen around them because, they weren't by my standards ""good"" which I know is horrible. 

I try to catch my self every single time that happens and try so hard to not think like that because to think of someone is lesser is so toxic. And then I try to empathize and think about what it would be like in their shoes and then I just realize what a pos I am. 

I feel like such a horrible person that will never change. I try so hard to make friends. Where I'm at in my job ther eis hardly any women. I hate it. Because I love people so much. My co-workers are mostly married, which is 100% dope because I keep it professional, I don't do anything with anyone I work with because I don't want things to become complicated. 

Anytime, and I mean almost every single time except twice. I get so put off by so many people because I am a female and the stereotype is that we want to sleep with everyone. 

I really like my co-workers. I make a point to ask them questions about their s/os see how they're doing, etc etc. And then when I meet them I spend most of my time talking to them, being what I perceive as real friendly because I really want more women in my life. I ask open ended questions, and don't really reference their husbands/boyfriend because I want a genuine friendship or at least to see if one would work out. I know I'm not super pushy about it, at least I don't think. And I try very hard to just be myself around them too. I don't treat them too differently than their s/os apart from asking them more about themselves. 

I went on a deployment, didn't sleep with anyone. On Facebook there are wives pages for your unit that you belong too and my name got passed around so much because I was one of like 6-10 females in about 600 that were there. 

I really didn't sleep with anyone. I was messaged and told I was a slut, B and every other name in the book. When someone asked me if I knew their s/o I would say, no I don't really talk to them bc I didn't and they would turn and say I'm a manipulative cunt. And other things. 

I try really hard to correct my behavior when I notice it. I am part of a few reddit groups that say really hurtful things about people with BPd and narcissism/traits of narcissism. I want to get better. There are literally hundreds of people that say I am just making it sound like I want to but in reality won't and never will, and I'll just be this horrible piece of shit my entire life.. I feel lonely. 

I'm in a relationship and I know sometimes I project things onto him which he is pateirn but it doesn't make it ok. I feel so terrible. I feel like I make him miserable whenever I ask for my complainst to be addressed productively. Initially I would just yell. Ehich I have worked on fixing. I'm not good at this. I haven't yelled. 

I have tried so hard to make my side heard. Every time I bring up a peoblem(my love language is quality time, and touch fhats legit it, because I don't trust words of affirmation[guys i work with use this to say real nice things to try to sleep with me, once I say im.not interested they call me a cunt, whore xyz] I don't really do gifts any more[that is one of his so I get him these as often as possible] but anytime I do he says that ai make him feel like shit so he leaves and then never talks about it again. 

I want to be better. Everyone inmental health groups say I can't. I do DBT(dialectical behavior therapy) and CBT(cognitive behavioral therapy) every other day or 2very 2 days, when im super sad I try to do them before bringing up something that is bothering me

My sister lives with me, I like my house clean she doesn't clean it. I ask very nicely she says she will, she doesn't. I'm sure there is some underlying depressive something going on but I don't know how to get her to open up to me more bc km.not super open with my family. I try to be as transparent as possible and list my boundaries and ask her what hers are and we get progress but after that no.

251,"So a little background on my self: I have severe anxiety, mostly coming out as social anxiety. Possible depression and idek what else. I am also under 18, and I'm on the quiet side, although I have anger issues. I have tried therapy, it didn't really work as the therapist really annoyed me. Like, I went through 4 or 5 therapists. I'm not looking for advice just wanting a clear answer to my question. 

So recently I've been seeing things, hearing things which I'm pretty sure weren't real. I've also been having hallucinations of people. Like, it's the same few people every time. I plucked up the courage to speak to one of them one time and surprisingly she answered me back. I don't quite remember the exact conversation we had but I'm pretty sure she was either a ghost (our house is haunted) or just a figment of what's left of my imagination. I've also been sleeping less, but have been perfectly energised the next day. I've also been having mood swings and possible suicidal thoughts. Like I don't know where they came from, because compared to most the kids in my school I actually have an alright life. But there's times where I'll do doing something I really enjoy, or I really wanna do and then I'll suddenly lose interest in doing anything apart from sitting there and thinking to myself. Like I don't know where any of this is coming from. It only started happening when I turned a teenager. I forgot to mention I used to get bullied though the majority of that has been sorted out now. There are times I don't want to get out of bed and I don't have any enthusiasm for anything

252,"My boyfriend just broke up with me. We'd been dating for over a year but had been friends for years before. He said he wasn't ready for a committed relationship. He didn't want to have another person to worry about. He said I'm too controlling and too depressed. This is his second to last year of college. He says it's been the worst. He hasn't gotten to ""be a college kid.""

He says I'm too controlling because I'm basically his second mother. He has to tell me where he's going and what he's doing and I don't really like him drinking. But, I never ever asked him to not drink. I have alcohol-related trauma and the mention of it creates an incredibly strong negative reaction in me. It makes me feel awful. Ideally I would like him to not drink, but never ever. not a single time. did I ever forbid him from it or tell him that he couldn't. Never. Whenever he wants to go out with his friends and drink, I never stop him. Yes, it makes me unhappy. I can't hide my emotions. But I still never stopped him. Not once. Whenever he went to parties with his friends, I just sat back and let him go. Never once was I invited, either. Even though his friends sometimes asked about me. Even his friends have brought their girlfriends to their parties. But not me.

He says he doesn't talk to or see his friends anymore, but he plays games with them all the time, they have multiple active group chats, he's been to three parties within the last week, he sees them at college all the time. He says all he does is talk to me. I believe that to be completely false. And moreover, I'm not sure how that's my fault in the first place. I've never stopped him from going out with his friends.

He says I'm too depressed. That one gets me. He says he spends all his yime trying to make sure he doesn't say or do anything to send me over the edge. Yes, I have depression. But, I am actively working to get better and I have been throughout this year. I've been going to a therapist whom I really like. And recently in these past few weeks, things have finally started to look up for me. Then the breakup happened. It's shattered me. I feel like I'm back at square one. Like all my progress was for nothing. And it hurts so much. I was doing so well and feeling so much better. Now I just feel broken.

I feel like I've been trying so hard to work on myself, and it's been all for nothing. I loved him. I still love him. I just feel absolutely shattered now. I feel like everything is crumbling down around me. I only have one friend but they live a long distance away and I can't go see them, which hurts me. I don't have a support group or anything.

Today I had a blowout, and I just wonder if somethings wrong with me. I'm happy and generally just fine on a day to day basis, but once every six months or so I just fucking lose it. Everyone knows me as a generally happy and nice guy, I like my job (albeit it is low paying, my wife is the provider atm). Our marriage is typically good, we rarely fight and get over it quickly. We are now expecting our first kid in May, and I feel happy about it mostly.

I feel like somewhere there's a constant unhappiness, but I can almost never really feel it. When it shows it's head, I makes me wanna go back to weed, drinking, porn, jacking off, all sorts of things that I've since quit. I was raised mormon, but am not active and don't think that's the issue cuz I'm at peace with my current religious level (agnostic of sorts). It makes me want a divorce and to live alone, though I can't imagine leaving my wife and I really don't want to. Suicide comes to mind every once in a while, but I'd never actually do it because of my religious view of it being a sin and I'm scared more of what would come after than I am of living my current life. 

I know I need to see a therapist to get a professional opinion on this, but money is a little tight with the baby coming, and I just have a hard time making myself go because I don't want to find out something is wrong with me, nor have I ever been good with coping mechanisms.

256,"Hey everyone,

I'm Isabella, an Australian film student and filmmaker and I have news that I think might excite those of you who are passionate about mental health and accurate representation in media.

I wanted to let you all know that I'm creating a free to watch web series called Saskia's Dream World, which will be launching on Youtube in March. The series is an experimental sci-fi that follows a girl from the future, Saskia, who is guided through her dreams by an AI program called CHI-98. After some time these dreams begin to fill in the blanks of a sinister conspiracy that was erased from her memory.

Though this series is high concept, once you peel back the layers, you see that our protagonist Saskia is just like any person who is struggling with their mental health and feels alone in the world.

We've just launched an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign and are nearly 40% of the way to our goal budget. The campaign is packed with information on the series and crew as well as important aspects like cast and crew diversity and the social issues that the series explores. With a small budget of $3000 AUD we're making this series to help you experience surreal dreams in waking life, while enjoying a great plot and strong characters.

I hope you can find a way to become apart of this exciting project by checking out our rewards in the link below. Feel free to direct message me if you have any questions at all about the show!

We talked and finally started telling each other ""I love you"" after hooking up for a while. I was/am emotionally crushed from all of it and have been extreamly clingy and insecure since June. 
I still love her and every fiber of my being wants her back. 
When does it get easier to live without her?",08Nov2020,1
258,"I like to trigger myself into panic attacks because I like the adrenaline rush it gives me, I feel my worst at school, and most of my panic attacks are from the idea of jumping under the school bus.

261,"I haven’t really had any mental health issues up until around late July when I suddenly started having anxiety. The anxiety I’m guessing was about the upcoming school year and while the pandemic didn’t freak me out, I realized once I got back to school I wanted to transfer and really didn’t want to be in that area or even at the school anymore. Long story short, I came home, dealt with a lot of grief, deep sadness, and the anxiety persisted for a while. I had a couple crises about school and life and stuff but I’m fine now. I’d say it’s been about 2 or 3 weeks since I last felt any anxiety although waves of sadness come at times. So my mental health has definitely been improving and I’ve been feeling better. However, when I was feeling really down I kind of stopped going out and driving much. I just was dealing with a ton of anxiety and driving and traffic just felt so stressful. My friends were mostly off at school and my new school is closer but I didn’t really have it in me to go to events and also deal with the traffic to get there. I usually love driving, I’m fairly adventurous, and I go out all the time. Is it normal to have been withdrawn for so long? It’s just before I didn’t feel motivated to go out and I was also worried about having a panic attack in public or while driving but I haven’t felt any anxiety in a while.",08Nov2020,1
262,"Hey everyone, 

I use coding to cope with my anxiety, I have had anxiety all my life, and recently became agoraphobic and developed really extreme panic attacks.   


My therapist wanted me to do a panic diary, and it involved printing out some sheets, and let's just say it seemed a bit archaic! How am I going to whip out my sheets and fill that in time (You are supposed to record the attack during or just after so that it's not just a ""memory"")   


I was terrible at this, and always forgot as it's not the first thing on my mind during an attack, so I adapted the panic diary into an application to make it easy and quick to log each attack, and see them in a list so you can share with your therapist at the next session!  


I'ts for iOS and you can download it [here](https://apple.co/3ldh2ce)

It you want it for free just DM me and I'll give you a code!

I would love some feedback and feature suggestions as I want to make it the best panic diary app out there!",08Nov2020,1
263,"I'm a Male senior in high school, My entire life I have been homeschooled and have serious attention problems. No matter how hard I try and focus I always end up getting sidetracked and once in a while hyper-focused, alongside with all of the other ADHD symptoms. 
Over the years of not properly being helped for it. It has caused me to waste the potential of my education, organized living space, lesser stress, severe anxiety, depression and overthinking things. 
I am currently only self-diagnosed but I am close to convincing my parents to allow me to get a diagnosis. However, They don't want me to get tested for ADHD. If I convince them to get me tested and I do have ADHD They have told me they won't allow me to get and medication for it because they ”Don't want me to become a different person.” and they hate any medication. I'm sure they won't even help me find any proper non-medical programs to help with it. How do I convince them that this is important and that I need proper care for it? Before I've lost all hopes of college, a well-paying job, etc.

265,"Hello. My girlfriend (22) has depression and anxiety, she has been in and out of therapy because we don't really have much funds to keep that constantly.

She has been staying with me in my house (with my family) for most of the pandemic and this is all completely fine for me, my family, and hers.

The problem is that she tells me every week or so when she has episodes of depression or anxiety, she tells me that she is quite uncomfortable living like ""this"". Or living with other people including me, that she would want to move out or escape on her own so she can hurt/kill herself without anybody seeing or batting an eye.

I'm usually one to support moving out or finding a place but I haven't agreed with this idea because I'm really scared of what she will do to herself when she's alone. I have also suggested coming with her of course but she just tells me she doesn't know or that defeats the purpose. Plus she added that she doesn't want to bother me or my family (I'm still studying) and this gives her a lot of anxiety because she feels that she weighs me down or that my family thinks ill of her.

I love this woman and I'm planning to move out with her as soon as I can, to make a safe place for her to recover from her trauma.
She has told me she is willing to wait for me to finish school and move out. 
I just want to know the possible things I can do to make it easy for her.
I give her the best time and attention everytime I can.

Thank you to anyone who replies. :)

PS. Small context. We are an Asian household (Filipino) that's why it's pretty normal for us to stay with our family during college or even way after that.",08Nov2020,1
266,"started two days ago. Its an extremely loud sound in my head, or at least i think. At first i thought it was a sound from outside bc it was so loud, its a constant beat, like a swoosh sound, best comparison would be someone walking on gravel. I’m going crazy, haven’t been able to sleep in 2 days because the sound is keeping me from falling a sleep. I am a mentally stable person, never had any previous mental health issues but now i cant believe wtf this is or
how this could happen to me, i have honestly no idea what this is but im going crazy",08Nov2020,1
267,"I'm currently 17. For the past two years I've been in a numb state of unreality. I have no motivation or desire to do anything, but lie in my bed sleeping or on the internet. I don't recognize my face in the mirror. It feels like I'm on auto pilot. The days pass by so quickly without anything in my life changing. It's like my real life has been put on pause. 

I've recently started getting help. I started seeing a therapist at the beginning of quarantine and have been prescribed a bunch of meds by a doctor and psychiatrist. These include cymbalta, celexa, and ativan. I'm currently on effexor, wellbutrin, abilify, and buspar.

I haven't felt an impact from a single one of these medications. 

I've tried exercising, quitting video games, eating healthy, therapy, and group therapy. 

Nothing seems to remove this brain fog. I need help this will be one of my last cries for help besides at my appointment with my psychiatrist and therapist on Tuesday and Wednesday. If nothing seems to help in the near future I will begin planning my death.",08Nov2020,1

269,"Hi hello I'm 22 I have severe depression and social anxiety, anyway...

I'm moving out of my parents' house to move in across the country with a friend I met online. My parents are one of the biggest sources of my depression and it's very important for my mental health to get away from them. My friend also has similarly bad mental health issues and we're mutually understanding of each other's needs and struggles, so they're one of the best possible roommates I could possibly have, honestly. They feel like family. I've never actually met this friend in person; I'm flying out to visit them before we actually move in together.

I've been dealing with really bad anxiety and I'm panicking that we won't get along in person. When they initially suggested we move in together, I was confident that this would be a great arrangement and everything would go smoothly, but now that I'm playing the waiting game, my anxiety is flaring up incredibly badly and I'm having irrational thoughts. I'm worried that my anxious thoughts are building resentment towards my friend and that I'll both lose a friend and the best thing for my mental health that I've had to look forward to in a long time.

I don't have much of a support network irl and I feel like finally being accepted by someone for who I am, including my flaws, is such a foreign concept that I'm having trouble understanding and accepting it. 

There were literally no issues with our relationship before moving was proposed. My friend hasn't actually done anything that makes me feel like this and I still really enjoy talking to them and hanging out with them. What can I do?",08Nov2020,1
270,"Looking for advice/support from anyone who understands, or deals with the same thing as me.

I (27F) recently self-discovered a majority of my anxiety is surrounded around abandonment issues from past relationships. Because of this and also lovely mental habits developed from my mother, I also have control issues.

My ex from a few years ago left me 4 times within a four year period, with little to no explanation each time. It was never my fault, he dealt with issues from his past as well and left me when he felt overwhelmed or scared. Because of this experience, my abandonment issues developed. Now, whenever I am in a relationship and I feel things such as distance or a change in behavior, it sends me into a panic driven by my fear of being abandoned. A lot of times you could say the things I become worried over are small, and tend to definitely be an overreaction on my part. 

The people in my life right now seem to be understanding when I get this way, but sometimes I don’t feel completely understood and can be seen as crazy, not confident or having low-self esteem. I’m sure this is partially true regarding relationships, but it’s BECAUSE of my past. I don’t react to behaviors just because i generally have low self-esteem. My past experience have caused my to have some confidence issues in relationships. I feel like there’s a difference there.

As far as control issues go, I tend to be sent into a spiral of panic when things don’t go the way they should in my brain. It’s almost always revolves around people and their behavior. Such as, wanting someone to text me back quicker than they do. Or asking someone if they want to hang out and they don’t want to. When it doesn’t go the way my mind wants it to, I begin to panic and then the abandonment fear sets in.

I struggle with relationships now because I fear abandonment more often than I should. Sometimes I feel like my reactions cause me to self-sabotage the entire thing. It’s so sad, I hate it. I want to stop being this way and just not be so afraid of being left. I really struggle with it.

I used to completely lose my mind when this feeling set in. I would send 30+ text messages, call them 10 times, even drive to their house. Which explains the combo of abandonment/control. Control: wanting them to respond or say SOMETHING to me rather than ignore me. Abandonment: extreme fear of them deciding to leave me. The combo of these two is completely awful. I’ve stopped the erratic behavior, and am able to hold back much more than I used to. So, I guess there’s an improvement.

I’ve never ever been to therapy (I know, not good), but i’m planning on going soon. I just want to be free of this. I want to not worry so much about if someone is going to leave me or not. I know consciously everyone can make their own choices, and so can I. But I still get those fearful moments where i’m so scared I will be alone once again.

I hope someone can relate, or understand me. And possibly talk to me or give advice on how to call myself down when I feel this way. I want it to stop, it’s not truly me and I want to just be myself again.",08Nov2020,1

272,"After going to college and failing almost every course I had I have never felt more disappointed,depressed,and alone in my entire life. At school I remember feeling like I was so under almost everyone even in the subjects I thought I was smart at even when I thought I was learning or doing something good I would usually at most get a C on it . I always felt like I didn’t belong there like I would be better off not being there . The first question people usually ask me was always why didn’t I study more why didn’t I ask for more help why didn’t I reach out more but I did all of those things to the best of my ability I tried my hardest on all assignments planned out times and days to study , went to study tables and even had a tutor . I still failed .. honestly I feel like my mental health stress and self loathing got in the way of me feeling the want the drive and motivation to reach out more. More than anything I didn’t get any support from my family I just felt so alone out there I had my girlfriend and a couple friends but besides that I had almost nothing . And now being home all I get asked is why I failed , how I failed why I didn’t ask for help even thinking about school almost triggers me into feeling like a failure thinking constantly about everything I did wrong at school and what I could’ve done better to past it hurts so much sometimes I think I would rather be better off dead but I still think If by any chance I go back to school I will succeed and do everything and anything possible to pass . I made this post as a way to vent and to tell anyone that is having the same struggles as me that you can do it and your not alone.",08Nov2020,1
