0,"I tried looking into this but most searches are for people who want to sleep but can't. I even talked to my therapist about this but I don't think she quite understands what I mean when I explain to her. I really hate sleeping. No I don't have night terriers or anything like that. I really have no reason to dislike sleeping as much as I do. I just really don't like it. When I end up passing out I feel like a failed or something. Like ""shit I slept"". Maybe it's because I just like to have more time to do the things I want to do. Sleeping sometimes makes me feel like I'm wasting away, even though I don't do anything that productive anyways. And quarantine isn't helping. I stay up until 5 to 6 am and wake up at 11 to 1pm. Yeah I getting some sleep but waking up that late making me feel like shit. I really don't like it. But some nights I don't sleep and I don't feel bad. I actually feel like I did something good. I never really feel tired, though I can tell that I am. I tend to ramble more and I process things a lot slower. And when I'm rambling I'll just randomly forget what I talking about completely. My focus gets worse too, and I already have ADHD. Even though my lack of sleep is causing all things bad things I still try to stay up late. Though there are rare moments when I actually want to sleep, I end up staying up a lot later than normal. I do look at screens a lot, watch videos or draw really late. I've been told to turn them off and just drift to sleep. I can't do that at all, I've tried and it just makes things worse. When I have nothing distracting me, my brain wonders to places I really don't want it to go to. Every time I end up freaking out and crying for hours until I pass out. Which makes me feel really tired when I wake up. I haven't tried it in a long time but I really don't want to since my mom died over the summer. I just can't let my mind wonder or I'll end up thinking about her. That or I just end up thinking about the stories I'm making. Then I get ideas and get all excited and end up feeling really awake. I even drink coffee later in the day so I can stay up later. I know I should be sleeping, all my friends chew me out for it. But I just can't seem to want sleep or just let it happen. It feels like my only way to actually sleep is to just let my body force me into it, even then it's relatively late. I end up never remembering falling asleep, I just remember waking up. Which I hate and makes me not want to sleep. I really don't know how to like sleep. I've been A night owl for most of my life but I didn't start feeling like this until when I became a teen. I'm 17 right now. It just slowly got worse when I got into high school. I really don't know how to fix this, I feel like it's only gonna get worse from here. I only want to fix this so I can be better in school because I think it's been effecting my grades. I feel like I'm so weird for this, idk if anyone else feels this way. I feel like people think I'm crazy when I tell them. I do have anxiety, maybe that's effecting it? It doesn't feel like it is. If anyone has any solutions or tips I'd love to hear some please.",04Apr2020,1

2,"I was thinking about how to start it in an interesting form and keep it short and I'm afraid I'll fail with both tasks. As you can see this is my first post on this account (I deleted one before) and for years I've been playing conversations in my head about how to talk about stuff like that. I usually came to a conclusion that I'm going in circles in self-pity and that I need to stop. There's also the chance that I'll be totally embarassed by this post tomorrow morning, but I'll let it stay here for ""educational purposes"", even if no one responds.


The main problem is, I think, my mother. I have a lot of holes in my memory from my childhood, a lot of allegedly false memories and I have trouble dealing with my emotions, but I think I had a bad childhood - and may even be abused. My parents are divorced, my dad cheated on my mom. I was about 11 when she learned about that and my father blamed it on her not paying attention to him since I was born and being generally mean. Tbh, I am not sure now if he loved me. Sure, it was fun to play computer games with him and goofing around, but he felt more like an older colleague than a father, however, this might be a false memory imprinted on me by my mom, because his ""Peter Pan syndrome"" was all she was talking about during the divorce process. However, I clearly remember him forgetting about me in a mall, in kindergarten, at school or leaving me alone at home (to go to his mistress probably) and saying things to me like ""remember to always dress nicely and be nice to your husband, not like your mother"". Now, last time I've seen him I was a teenager and I cut contact with him - because my mom wished so.
I have always been afraid of my mother and I always felt that I have to be cautious not to piss her off, which was fairly easy. She could get from being fine to a blind fury in a seconds over me being clumsy, saying something wrong, being too loud, not doing chores, eating too long, eating ""wrong"" (I had trouble swallowing), standing up to her, refusing something. She would also slap me across the face, which was very humiliating. I unconsciously learned to dodge and if I did it before she even tried to slap me and simply by making a sudden movement while yelling at me, this would make her furious and make her order me to come closer and then beat me. She never beat me to the point anything was showing though. This might also be a false memory, but I somehow remember her saying after somehow she caught me looking at myself if anything was visible that ""she's a doctor, she knows how to hit me and leave no trace"". I'm 60% sure it's a false memory though, such phrase might refer to sth different.
It isn't like my life looked like that every day. Far more often than not she was a caring mother, she encouraged me to be the best at school (I'm quite smart, forgive me the lack of modesty), backed me up, offered advice on some topics and generally be a good person. I used to fantasise that there's an evil Doppelgänger that somehow replaced my ""good mother"" and some day during her anger outburst a mysterious door appeares out of nowhere, my ""real"" mom steps out and the ""evil"" one dissapears, defeated. As you can probably imagine, I had (and still have) a whole universe in my head. I would retreat there every time I could.

I was ""trained"" to do certain things. I have this trait even now, that if you tell me to do a certain thing like that and reinforce it with a raised voice or authority or something similar, I'll proceed to do this thing like that from this moment until someone else tells me to do it the other way - which leaves me confused. One of this things is running to a person who waits for me to e.g. start a car. I was once or twice yelled at for being slow/retarded/lazy for walking slowly (I'm a phlegmatic) to her while she's waiting for me in a car while I went to throw away rubbish. I've noticed this and similar behaviors after one friend asked me, totally surprised, why was I running to him, when I went to throw away sth. The same thing is picking up things immediately after my mom dropped them, moving very swiftly out of her way (she got angry if she stumbled upon me), giving her tools with a handle pointing her way, doing certain chores before she comes home from work etc. Not doing some of those stuff now sometimes makes me uncomfortable, but I can easily make myself not do it. I'm still doing the chores though because - I want to help her and I don't want to piss her off.

And this is basically it. I moved out to attend middle school in a different city when I was 16 and since then I felt like my world has changed. I was bullied at school (my mom often said it was my fault because I was weak and let them bully me) and suddenly we were all too busy with school for such shit to happen. I made new friends and I've only came back home for weekends. I've never felt so free before. She missed me and was more often the mom I've always wanted her to be. Then I moved even further across the country to attend university and was coming home only for breaks.

The breaking point was when my only and best friend died. And, (please don't judge) - that was my cat. I'm crying while I'm writing this even if it was 4 years ago. Grief turned into apathy. Then I realised I was ""becoming more stupid"" - I wasn't thinking as swiftly as I used to, made mistakes in numbers, my memory was failing and this scared me. My mom said I'm overreacting, my friends were like ""if only I was as stupid as you think you are"" and I felt left alone. From this moment, it was getting progressively worse with brief moments of improvement. The breaking point was when I moved for a year abroad (which was fun but stressful, but in the same moment challenging and made my mind clearer again) - when I somehow got into my first relationship. I came back home and my mom reverted to her ""bad"" self - calling me names, picking on me, being generally mean. Then I went back to uni and realised that I have never ""loved"" this person, I was scared of this relationship and I was scared of telling him that. I had my first anxiety attack. It felt as if I was falling in a broken elevator, as if I was going to die and there was no way to make this feeling disappear. I later broke up with this guy (mutually, he also thought it won't work) and felt slightly better, but those attacks were now repeating. I started taking Lexapro and hoped it would work. It did, for 8 months.

This year I had one of my most wonderful holidays ever. I had a crush on my friend since a very long time but knew it probably won't work, so I never let it become anything more than a mild crush. Then, he suddenly started showing me this kind of affection that you simply can't mistake for anything less. Then, he admitted he has some feelings for me - and I couldn't believe what I just heard. That was the happiest moment of my life and I told him, that he's more than a friend to me too. We both agreed that we need to think about it, because we now live in different cities, I'm finishing uni etc etc. 

And three days later, after I asked him if he thought anything about it (too soon, I know, but I was too happy), he said he prefers we stayed just friends.
Oof.

We remained (a bit awkward) friends. I went back to my tiny room in my shared flat and started classes. I felt down and rejected, but I thought it was nothing serious. I was also off of Lexapro. And one day I was hit with a proper depressive state. I felt suddenly, that I'm already at the state of dying, there's no point in studying, sleeping or eating, because I as myself do not exist anymore. With the last bits of sanity, I called my mom. She somehow managed to pull me out of it, told me to take Lexapro again and after taking a bigger dose this time, after 3 weeks I felt much better.


Now, back to the topic of this post - what should I do next? I feel I'm getting worse. I'm now stuck with my mom due to corona (we live in a town and it's safer here) and she had a rage episode again. I don't know how to learn how to be in a relationship and love someone that I wasn't already friends with (I've trust issues and I'm not the Tinder type). I'm now 25 and I'm finishing med school and need to decide where to go afterwards - and I'm unable to decide. I lost my ambition towards medicine. I had a row of failures in scientific work and I feel like I can't make it work anymore, because I got more lazy and stupid. I simply have no idea what to do with myself now. I don't have time or money to go to therapy now either.

Please, if you have any advice and came this far with reading, help me.",04Apr2020,1

4,"I made a recent trip to the grocery store to last for the next two weeks or so. My SO and his family has been really cautious and provided us with baggies filled with a package of gloves and a couple surgical masks they've had for a while. My family, on the other hand seems to kind of avoid talking about being cautious. I know they are a little scared but don't really want to admit to what's happening right now. So I feel simultaneously angry at my family for being in la la land and also isolated emotionally from them because they think im an extremist on some level. 

So anyways, my SO and I decided to make a list and head to the store, and since we had these protective materials we thought we might as well use them because it makes sense. We protect ourselves and others. But walking into that store was so difficult. It might have been that I was a little more self conscious than usual but I got quite a few looks from people. A lot of people just not practicing social distancing and an overall, a really intense feeling of defensiveness from everyone. I eventually saw one other person wearing a mask and felt really relived that I wasn't the only one. 

Which I find so interesting. Why is it that I feel shame around trying to take precautions to keep myself safe? Why, around a certain audience, do I feel like an extremist?  What about the US makes people not want to accept what's happening right now?",04Apr2020,1

7,"So today I had my first two online music classes. It wasn’t really the actual class, it was just a sort of test and chat because we hadn’t seen each other in 3 weeks and we also had never done an online class before.

Anyway, I knew most of the people in both sessions because it’s music and I’m a senior so most faces are familiar. Now when I’m down, I isolate myself. I don’t like talking friends, and don’t participate in activities which are optional.  

So needless to say, I wasn’t looking forward to these sessions. I wasn’t worried, but I did not want to do it. I was just hoping that no one would talk to me, including my friends.

For some reason though, before I joined each one, my stress level skyrocketed. I suddenly got really nauseous, and I actually thought I was going to puke. It took a few minutes for it to subside, but it wasn’t fun at all. I didn’t have a reason to be stressed, yet I almost threw up.

Now I just dread having to do all my other sessions, and all of them start this Monday. Some I’ll skip because we can just watch the recordings later, but a lot of them I shouldn’t skip. I don’t want it to happen every time I’m about to join one.",04Apr2020,1
8,"I feel miserable, so miserable I can't even put it into words. Since I can remember my self I was never truly happy.

My parents destroyed my dreams tho, even if they didn't intended to. From when I was a small I kid I was listening my parents talking about how everyone that has free time and have fun is just a loafer and a lazy person and they taught me that life Is working. When I was in high school and near graduation I told my parents that I wanted to be an artist. They told me that they wouldn't waste their money for me to do something so useless. After graduating I studied information technology. I was never happy with that but it wasn't terribly either. Growing older made me more and more numb. I have no will to live but I don't really wanna die either. I hate everyone, I never met a person which I liked and I had never a relationship. I feel entertained when bad things happen to people and I don't care about human lives, I don't feel pity even if something bad happens to an innocent child. I actually wish that everyone was unhappy, unfortunate and miserable. I care about nothing and yet I keep on living without a reason to. In the end there is no point in living.",04Apr2020,1

And I'm sorry and I dont want to contribute to the negativity that's already in the world but obviously I'm going to so no excuses. I'm just so tired of everything. Senior year was already not going great because of some other problems I was dealing with friends and relationships and family. And then this shit happens and now my senior year is basically cancelled and i know that's selfish and i shouldnt be complaining because that's such a selfish and stupid first world problem but i just want to see the few friends i have and value one last time before we each go our separate ways and never see each other again because I was starting to create more meaningful friendships and I just want to cherish what little time I have left. Work is so stressful, every one is on edge. Especially my nurses and because my nurses are on edge now I am too because I've never seen my nurses like this ever and we already had a covid scare and then my favorite resident died but whenever some dies there you just accept it and move on and essentially never tall about that person as if he/she never existed. Plus now I'm getting these migraines practically every day or every other day and it's frustrating. I'm so exhausted I just want to sleep all day but even when i sleep I'm still exhausted. I'm waking with night sweats again which makes it so i cant sleep well and i already cant sleep well, I have to take so much nyquil or benadryl or both to even feel tired. And school is obviously stressful because I dont know what I'm doing and my teachers dont know what they're doing and I just found out that some of the stuff I learned for my AP tests wont even be on the God dam AP tests and now the tests are 45 minutes long and open book so I basically took these classes for absolutely no reason and.

It's been 6 years since my last relapse and I really don't want to experience that again. And with COVID-19 having everyone staying at home , Mental health resources are basically non existent.

22,"I don't even know where to begin typing this. I first went to the doctor 4 about my mental health in 2016 when I was 16. I didn't understand the full grasp of what was going on in my head at the time but I felt like I needed help. The doctor referred me to a specialist who wrote back and essentially said I wasn't depressed enough for treatment. It took a lot for me to open up like that and I was left so humiliated by the ordeal that I decided I wouldn't look for anymore help from then onward. 

Since then my mental state has grown significantly worse. I have no sense of identity whatsoever and I feel like robot that is going through the motions pretending to be human. I put on a front to the world and pretend to be a certain person but that isn't a reflection of who is inside. The problem is that over time I have grown so used to living like this that I don't even recognise a person within myself anymore. Sometimes I stare at myself in the mirror and I feel like there is nobody looking back at me. I just feel like an empty shell of a person. I think this all stems from the mental abuse from my parents growing up. As a child I was fairly effeminate and my parents took every measure possible to drill this out of me as soon as possible. My dad would regularly taunt me, call me names and remind me how much of a failure I was. My mum would either join in or else she would just stay quiet. Of course this was only one of the things ""wrong"" with me but I think it's one of the most significant. I didn't have any friends at school either. I think I just wanted to be accepted and so I made a conscious effort to repress every aspect of my personality, so I would be deemed more likeable. I always felt like two different people; the persona that I presented to the world, and the ""real"" me that was inside. Over time I got so used to living this way that somewhere along the line the person inside completely disappeared. 

Bringing us up to present I am more depressed than ever before, anxious, I have severe mood swings and some form of an eating disorder. Since I haven't told anyone about it I haven't actually been diagnosed with any of these things but the symptoms are all there. I am fairly convinced I have some form of personality disorder. For as long as I can remember my mood has always been temperamental but lately it has been extreme. I've been telling myself I might just be going crazy due to social distancing but who knows. For the past few days I've been bouncing off the walls, absolutely full of energy and unable to contain my excitement about the end of coronavirus so I can have fun and live my life. This feeling was like nothing I've ever experienced in life, I just felt completely elated. Obviously that feeling didn't last though. Now I am back on the ground wishing I'd never been born again.

I keep telling myself that if I just change my situation I can handle it myself. I really do think there is some truth in this but I think I've become too aware of my problems at this point to just keep ignoring them. I tell myself if I go back to the gym then maybe I'll feel better but I haven't exercised properly since before I developed my troubles with food and I think going back to the gym will just make it worse. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I know that I desperately need help but can't bring myself to reach out for it again. I want to discover the ""real"" me but I'm so used to how I've always lived that I'm scared to get to know myself properly. I feel so let down by everyone I've ever confided in that I just want to keep it all to myself. But I can't because my head is one of these about to explode.

27,"One of the the things I hate the most is when someone calls me annoying. I feel like I’m worthless and not deserving to live when someone calls me that. Before I say anymore I wanna let you know that I’m an introvert and I don’t have that much friends. I’m also in high school. But every friend I have except one calls me annoying. Hell, even one said that there’s just something about me and my appearance that makes me annoying. I don’t say much and when I do I get called annoying. I feel pissed and depressed at the same time. I try to text a friend of mine and they tell me to stop because it’s annoying. One picks on me and every time I talk he says that I’m annoying. One time I tried to text him on Snapchat and he gets pissed at me for “texting him out of the blue”. I thought that you’re supposed to text people but I don’t anyone. It feels like I never fit in with anyone  because of this. I never talk to my parents about this because they won’t take me seriously.
No wonder why I hate talking. I’m better off having my vocal cords getting ripped out of me. I just can’t take this anymore. I’m not suicidal (yet) but I just feel mentally hurt and tired.

I really care about her and want to see her get better, but I don't know how to help her. She has told me that every time she tries to talk to her mom about it, her mom either disregards it completely, or turns it around on her taking it as some personal attack, saying that she just doesn't love her mom.

I don't believe she lives in an abusive household, rather her parents are just ill-equipped to handle a situation like this and were not educated properly on what to do. and are a bit stupid too

32,"So, long story short, my gf wanted to try some butt stuff on me (a straight male), and while I initially was really put off by that idea, I eventually got curious too and decided to try something with my fingers before taking any permanent decision.

Now fast forward to today. I decided to try some stuff in the shower by myself, and managed to actually climax just from using my fingers. And while it felt good, for some reason it also felt wrong... I cleaned up, thinking about what I had just done, and started feeling increasingly more sick with myself. I don't know, it just didn't feel right... It didn't take long until a strange nausea took over me, my whole body started feeling really heavy, and my vision became a blur. All while the sensation of disgust with myself intensified. I had to take a moment to sit down afterwards, waiting for it all to pass.

This was really uncomfortable to me, and now I'm afraid I might have awakened something and start experiencing this sometimes in moments of sexual pleasure... I am still curious, but won't be doing this again or anything else too out there until I sort this out. Idk for sure what it is, but it sounds like some kind of trauma? I'd like some feedback regarding this...

Looking back at what might've caused this, I remember mainly three things. One of which was an unpleasant experience I've had in elementary school that I don't think it's worth describing now, since I don't think that's still affecting me. The other two are the more relevant, I think...

When I was about 13\~16 years old I've had some annual sex ed classes, that when I look back at it, I'm pretty sure scarred me to some degree. Because at the end most of those classes we would be described and shown some photos of the really really bad cases of sexually transmitted infections. By the end of those classes, I always felt disgusted and nauseated a bit in the same way I did today. I was already sensitive to some stuff about our genital parts (mostly maybe thinking about how it is on the inside, and I had already briefly had similar feelings on some science classes, tho much less severe), and gore, and all that nasty stuff. Maybe I already had something going by then maybe it intensified it all. I don't know. But shock therapy on sex ed classes should be a big no, that's for sure.

Now the other thing is, since I was always very awkward and silent about girls (that elementary school experience certainly didn't help), I eventually had a friend or two poking fun at me about my sexuality. I knew for sure I wasn't gay, due to the porn I liked. Possibly bi in denial, but I don't think so, because I never really saw boys that way. But anyway, thing is, this eventually spiraled into intrusive obsessive thoughts about my sexuality. And at points, I experienced this kind of nausea because of it too. It was horrible... I haven't had that in a long time now, and I thought I was free of it, but after this experience... I don't know anymore. Gay sex was something I found a bit icky, and a big no, and I guess that's what made it feel so wrong now. I thought I was done for with this, but yet here I am now... Disgusted at myself for making me feel good in a way that I used to think I shouldn't.

I've read some time ago about a condition like this last one (can't remember the name) often being fueled by porn, but thankfully I got rid of porn a while ago, so at least I got that...

I think I had something more to add, but honestly, I can't remember it now, so I'll leave it at this. I know this is a weird topic, but any help would be greatly appreciated! And thank you for listening :)",04Apr2020,1
33,"I was bullied when I was younger and eventually I found that my only source of validation was talking to random men online I’d meet through Omegle and maybe sometimes sext with on kik and Snapchat. I never used my real name. I’d try my hardest to keep from revealing anything too telling about myself, and at the time I wasn’t thinking about the consequences of my actions but now I feel horrible. Thinking about it makes my whole body feel numb and it takes me a while to find ways to distract myself and make myself forget about it, but I know I never fully will. 

I didn’t always send pictures (sometimes would just straight up sext through story/describing sex acts), only did so and video chatted without showing my face a couple of times. I oftentimes avoided showing my face like the plague but when I first started I would do it sometimes. I look different now because I used to be a lot chubbier but there’s still an obvious resemblance. I’m moving into a stage in my life where I want to grow and improve and be better but I feel like this drags me down and holds me back so much.

The fact that I can’t take back my actions kills me. I have deleted all emails, kik and Snapchat accounts that I would do this with because I’d never use my personal since I was trying to avoid being identified as much as possible, but with the way the internet and social media work now a days I’m so scared that I’ll be found by one of these men that took advantage of my vulnerability and it will destroy my life. My hope is that none of them kept the pictures, but you never truly know. I feel so stupid and scared and I don’t know how to make myself feel better. I’ve tried talking to my friends about this but none of them ever did things like this so they can’t relate/don’t know how to make me feel better. 

I feel so so so dumb and scared. Has anyone here done anything similar and felt the same way? How did you deal with it?",04Apr2020,1

When I was 13, I was depressed and anxious to the point of hiding knives under my pillows. I'd had enough. I overdosed.
It didn't work, so I tried again a few months later. And again. And again. Four times I attempted, and many more times I took two, three, four times the usual dosage of sleep meds. 

Four years later. 17th birthday was a week ago exactly. The gel pills for my usual meds ran out so they had to give me dry chalky pills (think benadryl/advil/no plastic casing). I've been sitting here trying not to puke for the past 10 mins.

I think, eventually, it might go away. Or I can keep distracting myself with gel capsules like I usually do.

I survived PTSD from the mental hospital, stopped cutting, survived anorexia and bulimia, and the one thing that still takes me back to all those attempts are these pills.

I couldn't take it and I cried. I told my brother it was just my feeling of hypocrisy. That how can I give advice to a depressive when I can't even help myself. But it wasn't that.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My mom is either a drug addict, or developed some sort of mental health issue and I don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Story:

&amp;#x200B;

My mother has macular degeneration and has for years. She messed her foot up and got surgery which resulted in a more messed up foot. She had a weight problem and was a waitress on her feet all day so she's got bulging discs. About 4 years ago she was up to 10 vicodin a day. She claims to have cold turkeyed that against my wishes as i've been around drug addicts and was one myself for quite a few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to around October of last year. My mother lost control of the finances after gambling it away on a video poker game. My step dad took over and it became world war 3. She started losing it completely claiming my step dad was cheating on her, hacking her iphon/ipad. I work in infosec so i've tried pleaing with her that this is impossible. 

&amp;#x200B;

The more you try to reason with her the more she refuses to talk to you and thinks you're just not believing her. She started going to a therapist around September of last year and her and my step dad started seeing this therapist around November. If the session didn't cater to my mother she would lose her mind about how my step dad lied to the therapist to get his way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Side Note: My whole life my mothers been a manipulator. She's like 5th degree black belt

&amp;#x200B;

So my step father has a hard time controlling his anger which this whole situation is going to come to boiling point which it did. A physical altercation I wasn't a part of got escalated and my step father went to jail for domestic abuse. I wasn't there to know but I can have my own thoughts and believe who I believe. I don't believe there was domestic abuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom and step father go at it verbally every single day. She believes something new every couple days. It's gotten to a point where she believe I flew into town, sent her pictures of me being at the airport, walk by her house to taunt her, and change her channels while she's watching tv. I live a good 18 hour drive from her and up until recently haven't had money to travel. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the drug problem. She was up to 10 vicodin a day I believe I mentioned that above. That was about 4 years ago. She got changed to non-habit forming pain meds which I can't recall right now. Regardless, she admitted to taking my little brother ADD meds, taking my step fathers diabetes and muscle relaxer meds, so god knows what else she's taken and when. 

&amp;#x200B;

The domestic abuse charges have made it so my step father is to have no contact with her except through my little brother. He decided it was in the best interest of the family to move back in against mine and his lawyers wishes. My little brother is senior year highschool and called me today to tell me they're back to yelling at each other every day. 

&amp;#x200B;

Mental health laws make it so we cannot force her to seek help. I believe she's got a drug issue that's underlying but also a mental health issue. The mental health laws don't help with getting her the help she needs, nobody in my family is willing to risk their safety to get her the help but they rely on me to vent to. I have no fucking clue what to do anymore. She needs help before she hurts herself.",04Apr2020,1
39,"Hey all. Since coronavirus is a thing bringing the world to a halt, and a bit before that even, I have begun talking to myself. As a preface, I've had a recent breakup with someone who was amazing, however her anxiety and depression issues (ie not good enough for me, that sort of thing) made things rather difficult, and we ultimately stopped being a thing.

Onto the meat, after the breakup, I did lose a confidant who I could talk to about everything on my mind, as she would provide some amazing emotional validation which I really needed. With her gone, and other life shifts, (starting uni, covid), I've been finding myself in very bad habits, mental health wise. Not working on assignments early (not new, but something I was working on changing with uni), procrastination, finding very little motivation to get out of bed, and to do anything once actually out of bed. So a couple times, I've found myself laying in bed, and physically talking to myself.

One ""person"" in this conversation is the scared one, the one who doesn't want to do the work, who wants to hide away, watch youtube, and just avoid everything. The other is confident, giving the obvious pointers, telling what I should be doing, telling me to get up, to watch my steps, go one at a time, and Do. But he never gets ""control"", if that makes any sense. As an fyi, I haven't felt any kind of suicidal in 5 years, and I don't feel it now.

Idk, I guess I'm rambling at this point. I haven't told anyone about this specifically, but I do have support in friends and family. Any help from you guys would be nice, cheers.",04Apr2020,1

She wouldn’t even put food in the house I had to go down the street to my friends house to make a sandwich . I wore the shoes I had so much they had holes in the bottoms (they were cheap canvas shoes I got from Walmart and had to wear them year round) the winter coat I wore for year came from my aunt otherwise I usually wore multiple thin sweaters to layer and keep warm because I didn’t have anything else .

Even if it’s over little things . It’s annoying at this point I’ve dealt with it so much . I’ve made my peace with god about the situation . I haven’t been the perfect person either in correlation to things . Sometimes I get angry , yell , call her names , throw things , punch walls , and I KNOW THATS NOT OKAY . but it’s literally nothing compared to what she’s done to me . She’s literally kicked my head into cabinets with steel toe boots on , swung me around by hair because I was so small , attacked me with a broken golf club , attacked me with broken baseball bats , given me black eyes , scratches and bruises on my body and face , and etc . She constantly tells me to kill myself , or drive and crash and die , and other shit like that . Shes right about some things . I am broke , and I am a bum , and I don’t bring money home but I’ve been working faithfully since I was 16 and only took a break recently . I don’t even want to go into what I was doing before then to survive . Shit happens and I’m ready to move on with life and be happy . I don’t want to be sad and depressing . I want to be happy and a good person and help people . I plan to prepare my body to join the navy and be out of her hair . Literally as I type this shes telling me to leave so she can move on with her life . She’s not sorry for what she’s done . Shes playing victim like I hurt her and she’s done nothing wrong to me . Even though she done me 15 times worse than I’ve ever done her But when I told her I’ll leave she says no . I act like I don’t care , but I do . It fucking hurts to know that the person I’ve seeked love from most of my life doesn’t give a shit but my brother who’s literally stolen hundreds from her , spent money she told him she couldn’t afford to spend , attempted to rob her house , and actually has once , told her she’s not his family even though she’s made sure he was straight and happy no matter what , attacked me multiple times , cursed out her mother , and etc , gets the love I’ve sought and worked for , for so damn long . I’ve been here for her through everything and I’ve never stolen a dime from her , I support her in everything , her car broke down I allow her to take mine to and from work . I take her to the store and keep her company in the story , she asks me to do something I do it , when he attempted to rob her house a second time I literally came home in enough time to save her and stop it , i now sit home alone everyday scared to death he might come with a gun and try to rob us again . I try to help her realize when he tries to use her for what he wants . I try to get her to love me but she won’t , and I truly don’t understand . But I do trust in god . I do believe everything happens for a reason , I believe god will bring the love and acceptance into my life that I’ve sought for so long . I believe god will help me heal , and help mold me into the person I truly want to be regardless of my circumstances, I believe he will help make me stronger because of it , not weaker due to my downfalls . I will train , I will join the navy , I will succeed , I will persevere , I will prove both her and my brother wrong . In Spite of the fact that they try to make me feel like I’m nothing . I will leave , I will be dead to both of them , and I promise you , they WILL regret it .

My therapist told me that staff weren’t allowed to lay their hands on me. I believed him. When I went to go stand on the porch for a breather last night, I was restrained by a male staff (I’m a 17 y.o girl. weak and small.), he picked me up and turned me around and slammed me on a coffee table and then onto the ground. He had me pinned on the ground and wouldn’t let me go, even though I was in obvious physical pain and was having a panic attack. He only let me go after a female staff told him to get off of me.

I left that situation with a massive bruise on my leg, my hands, and my face. There are probably more, but I’m too scared to check.

It hurts, and I’ve explained this several times. I’m already not feeling the best about my postpartum body, I just feel like I’m at a loss. I’m to the point where I’m done trying to pursue because I’m tired of feeling rejected. I love my partner, I truly do, but I can’t stand feeling the way that I feel. 

I just wanted to vent a little bit since I don’t have anyone to really talk to about this. Much love, stay safe.",04Apr2020,1
56,"Fox example, today I feel like I'm having trouble putting sentences that make sense together and a lot of what comes out sounds weird. I've retyped a couple emails several times at work tonight bc what I type doesn't look right to me.

I suffer from major depressive disorder and general anxiety but I dont know if this is a side effect from those? I have been dealing with a very stressful situation lately. 

I don't have days like this very often but when I do have them, they are really annoying.",04Apr2020,1
57,"So these past few years have been rough for me &amp; I noticed a larger pattern that has presented itself in different ways throughout my life &amp; I decided to get assessed by a psychologist. 

I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, &amp; ""other specified personality disorder with negativistic, avoidant, &amp; borderline features."" 

I'm feeling a lot of emotions right now &amp; I'm just wondering how you reacted when you were diagnosed? I don't think I was expecting such a broad diagnosis in the ""other specified personality disorder"" but when I researched the 3 disorders I had features of, it made more sense.

I've worked in social services for years &amp; have always heard of the stigma surrounding mental illness, but I don't think I understood it until the psychologist diagnosed me. I just remember all those times I tried to talk to friends &amp; was told ""you just complain too much"" or ""you just need to try harder to be happy"" &amp; even now I feel like I can't talk to them about these issues because they are mental illnesses &amp; not a physical ailment. 

Anyway, it just feels like a lot. I'm reaching out to establish with a regular therapist &amp; psychiatrist but I needed to get this off my chest &amp; I wanted to hear from others. It has me thinking about how I want to proceed with my career &amp; what I want to do with my life in general.",04Apr2020,1
58,"I hate my personality. I’m so mean and I hate it. I’m always irritable and angry to anyone that’s around me. It’s gotten better in the past but with quarantine it’s coming back. For example, if I was in class and someone was bouncing their leg in my sight, I just had to close my eyes. I couldn’t take it. If I heard chewing or breathing, I had to cover my ears with my hands. Even people simply talking or whispering behind me— I’m covering my ears. 

When I was prescribed an SSRI, I improved so much. My misophonia was so much better and I was happier, but I feel like crap right now. I’m so unmotivated. I don’t want to do anything anymore. I used to go to therapy but stopped because it’s expensive and insurance doesn’t cover mental health. 

I cry knowing how I would treat my parents. I wouldn’t cuss them out or anything, but my tone was always harsh. Everything made me irritable. I feel like I’m the worst person on the planet. Am I that rude or is it my brain? I try to explain my irritability and I just get told how rude I am. I know it’s rude. I just can’t control it. I try so hard and I hate it",04Apr2020,1
59,"This is just going to be a rant. I have been so angry lately and maybe screaming into the internet void will help.

I have major and persistent depressive disorder, and panic disorder. All of these have just been thrown into overdrive for the past month. 

At the very beginning of the month, I had to go to the ER for a bad tooth infection. I was in excruciating pain and crying non-stop because of it. They sent me home with antibiotics, oxycodone, and Xanax for my dentophobia. Turns out, I can't take oxycodone without getting horrible side effects. I was bedridden for a few days because it made me incredibly ill, on top of still having the infection. Exactly one week later, I got food poisoning, so I was once again sick with the infection. Finally, I finished my antibiotics and could go to the dentist. Only guess what, here comes a pandemic, and my entire state when into lockdown. No dentists are seeing patients right now. Everything is shut down. My tooth is still sore, but I know it will most likely be pulled out when all of this clears up, and I'm living off of ibuprofen for now. 

Dentists aren't the only thing though, my college is cancelled for the rest of the semester, so I no longer have my reason to keep getting up in the morning. I was taking a class I was especially passionate about and now it's been taken away from me. My chance at socializing with people who have the same interests is gone.

As if this bullshit wasn't enough, my husband is away for the army on the other side of the country. He was supposed to come home for good at the beginning of May, and now since his base is in quarantine, that has been pushed to the end of May. I have seen him twice in person (one time was only for a few hours) since August. That's one more month away from my husband. 

Being in quarantine is making my mental illnesses worse. I was promised a job, but that got put on hold until further notice. I live with my in-laws, and while I love them, I have no way to get a break from them that I desperately need. I am trapped in a house that doesn't feel like home with people who don't feel like family. 

I'm scared right now. I have no more refills for my antidepressants, so I don't know what's going to happen when I run out. I am feeling so overwhelmed right now. All I want is an escape or a break, and I can't get it.",04Apr2020,1

69,"So this is a very long story but I need help, and I will not accept ""block her"" as an answer. I am not abandoning her.
So I have a friend, I'll call her Ash for this but that's not her name. So Ash is a trans girl I met on discord last fall. We realy hit it off and dated for a few months. Things were great. We would send photos to eachother. Stay up late talking. Sext every now and then. Normal E dating stuff.
One day she broke it off with me saying that we can't date because she didn't love me like she did, but wanted to be Friends With Benefits. I told her no and then blocked her, but then I felt bad because she was trans and I know the statistic that 50% of trans people attempt suicide and 2% actualy die. That's higher than any group in history. I don't know why that is but that's not the point. 
So for a while things were ok. She would hit on me but I tended to ignore it. She also hit on a lot of other people in the server. Some reciprocated. Some didn't, but over all she was general well liked. That was until about 2 weeks ago. She had a mental breakdown and started doing things like spamming gore all over the server. She also spammed images of cuts on her arm that spelled out something like ""GRAT"" we thought that it might have been a guy on the server she liked named Greg and did it wrong because of her breakdown.We banned her but I still cared deeply about her. I needed to figure out what was happening.
It turns out she was having a mental breakdown about her ex before me. 
So Ash was adiment that she loved him and could never find another guy like him (ouch right) and that if she can't be with him again that she should just die. At this point she said the only way she couldn't kill herself was to call him. I called him 5 times rapidly because I was scared that one of the only people I ever cared about as deeply as her was going to die. Eventually we get him to join the server ""me and about 3 other people who were her friends where trying to figure out what to do"" 
Here is the revelations of the story. Remember when I told you she cut GRAT into her arm. Her Ex's name was ""GRANT"" he also sent me an almost year old photo that was the same image flipped 90 degrees. I was furious. We all banned and blocked her. I ended up joining Grant's server and he told me a lot more about her that I don't know for sure. Most of it bad.
For the next 3 days I wad still pissed, but on the 4th i felt bad. I know that when someone has a breakdown like that that people can't control themselves. I unblocked and friended her and immediately she began going on about how she was going to commit suicide and that the only thing that could stop her was Grant. I tried but I could event get grant to say good bye, and even if I could it would have probably been a bad thing because then she would have had enough closure to die.
Eventually she video called me and I saw her with my own eyes swallow an entire bottle of quote ""prescription heart pills"" and a whole (small) bottle of vodka. I knew it was the end so I told her. ""I don't want you to die alone, so I'll sit in a call with you until you pass to heaven."" (She wasn't religious but I was hoping that the thought of an afterlife would calm her in her final moments.) It's an eerie thing to sit next to someone that you know is going to die, and the last person they will ever speak to is you. Then in just a few moments you would have to tell everyone she knew. Her family. Her friends. everyone that she figurativly died in your arms. I told her to visit me in a dream some time.Then a maricle that I could only thank the father son and holy spirit for. She said she couldn't do it. She vomited it right on camera. I never thought I could have been that happy to see puke before. She was still crying, but alive. I felt it was safe to go to bed.
From this point on I was hesitant to talk to her because I was selfishly scared that she could do this again at any moment. Today she did it again. I learned that she had a contact to every one of Grant's friends on discord. They didn't care as much for her as I did, and I'm sure that many of them wished she did die. I spoke to her for over and hour. Eventually I felt that she was safe to be left alone. I told her that I was going to block her for the rest of the night and then refriend her in the morning. I felt she needed to be alone for a little.
I know she's not going to kill herself tonight. According to grant (who I think Is the only one of them that still cared about her life) told me she had been doing it every few weeks since they broke up (I'm not sure of the validity of that since we had been dating since fall) so I know she's not dead right now, but I need a way to keep her with us. 
I belive in life that every person on earth was put here to help someone and make it better. Find the hopeless and give them hope. I can't do that alone. I need anything anyone could do to keep her with us. I need help and this seems like the only place that anyone could help with that. The suicide hotline just said ""oh don't kill yourself life is precious"" and other robot bulcrap that they spit. I don't think she can go to a therapist because of how poor she is.
What do I do. What can I do. I know she can be saved. How can I get her off of Grant. Please I need help.",04Apr2020,1

Hey can someone please help me
I am a 17 year old girl i know this sounds so random but i’ve always felt weird when someone from my family talked about my cousin who i think is almost 9 years older than me . Everytime when he would come visit us or my grandparents i always felt weird and repulsed ? I always felt uncomfortable around him and felt annoyed whenever someone would talk about him . For a long period of time i didn’t know why and i couldn’t really understand why do i feel like this. Untill one day when it all popped into my head . The thing is that i don’t remember everything and what i do remember i don’t see it too clear . I remember one time me and my  whole family went to my grandparents house to just hang out and stuff, my cousin and his parents were coming too . I don’t remember how old i was which is weird but i don’t even think i was in first grade . I don’t recall much of that day but i remember everyone sitting in a room while me and my cousin went to the other room alone, we were sitting on the bed next to eachother and the next thing i remember is him taking my hand and placing it under his pants, i dragged my hand back and after a few seconds he did it again, i don’t remember anything after that just the fact that someone entered the room and i said i need to wash my hands . That’s all. This is very scary and the weirdest thing is that i don’t know if my mind made it up or this really happened and i’ve tried to surpress it .

77,"Hi,
I have a significant other who ha Bipolar-I
And she has had psychotic tendencies.
And so as a way of keeping check on any negative thoughts we made up a rule/promise that if one of us harms ourselves, the other one can too. And I don't have any such tendencies. But I thought that this would come in her way of her thoughts about harm. 
Once she lost her pills, had withdrawals, and thought about harming herself. Had to stay on the phone with her (she's a 5hr drive) until it passed.
I know this ""promise"" is kind of fucked up but I don't know what else to do.
Also a recent red flag is that she's been telling me she can make decisions on her own, and so wants me to just  ""be there for her and support her"", but insists that this promise not be a thing.

The promise is kinda me blackmailing her into not harming myself. And I know this is messed up. But I don't know what else to do short of calling 911 on her if god forbid something goes wrong.
She says that if she has psychosis then she can't do anything, and she might end up breaking the promise. Since she won't be in her right mind. And that's true.
But I don't know what to do when shit goes that bad.

Any advice will be much appreciated.

Recently, I’ve been really worried about my close friends’ safety.
 With my close friends I felt like I could express myself the way I want to, but with this cv spreading to a big town like mine, my friends won’t listen to my concerns. 
They stop talking to me when I try to tell them it’s important to stay indoors, or if I tell them not to go outside even if they’re healthy. My best friend won’t talk to me anymore because I was trying to tell him not to go out to bars but he thinks I’m panicking.

Whenever I try to apologize to my friends about me being really concerned for them, they leave me on read. 
Or if not, I just get told “don’t tell me what’s best for my safety.”

It really hurts me because when I’m trying to help and people aren’t willing to listen, it keeps me up at night and it gives me a lot of panic attacks. I feel lonelier and I worry so much...

Back story
I am a 13 enby from England. I live in the Manchester area. I've been under CAMHS for years because I have high functioning autism, social anxiety and am getting therapy for depression. They are terrible to put it straight. My family is kinda f'd up. My mother is great but she doesn't understand. My best friend is American, older then me and studies psychology on the side. He has some of the same things as me. And this is the convo we just had... Basically.

So, I attempted suicide on Christmas day, but I didn't do it because of my bff. Family didn't even notice. I've been to a&amp;e before for it but they sent me home because they didn't have enough beds. I hurt myself a lot, I smashed my head into my wall and, quote from the convo, it was because 'Actually its because I wanted to break my skull opened so I could die in the way I was supposed to. Bloody and painfully.' I want to murder someone. I think one of my family, my mom probably. I love her but still. I'm not sure what to do. I hear and see things and its getting MUCH worse. My friend said I should do the CAMHS live thing and try to get to the psych ward. Any advice? Idk what to do. Thank you all.

89,"Hello everyone!  

I hope this is an appropriate subreddit to post these questions on. If not, I would love to hear about another one that is more fitting. :D

# Question One

[https://pastebin.com/RFdqM2sM](https://pastebin.com/RFdqM2sM) 

A **TL;DR** of this question would be: Is it possible for someone with a history of childhood repression to repress a **non-traumatic** event **completely** over a **few minutes**? This girl has been known to act out for attention in the past, but as I am not a medical professional, I cannot say for certain that this is false. 

Later, I confronted her about it, talking about how I tried to research and find explanations for it. She reacted with intense negativity. She said things like ""this is why I don't trust people"", ""I can't trust you anymore"", ""this is why I don't get close to logical people"", and ""you just gave me the biggest reason not to trust you"".

# Question Two

I have a follow-up question. 

[https://pastebin.com/MM9hf62W](https://pastebin.com/MM9hf62W) 

How this ended up is, at one point, I asked her about it. She went on to tell me that she has voices in her head (multiple personalities) that can take over sometimes. She said that's what happened that night. She explained that one personality is an authoritative mother figure and the other is a wild and flirtatious one.

Only once did I experience these personalities come out, if they did, come out. They used the verbiage ""this body is so uncomfortable"" and ""she is upset"" (talking about the girl from a third-person perspective).

I ultimately let it pass because I was unsure how to deal with it.

# Summary

With these two situations, my honest standpoint is that both of them are faked. I was under the impression that memory repression takes YEARS, not minutes. I also believe they only happen during extremely traumatic events like war, death, rape, abuse, etc. I believe she was using it to manipulate me or maybe get attention...(?) I am unsure. Anyone who can help advise me on this situation would be greatly appreciated.

  
As for the multiple personalities, she used that to shift responsibility off of acting strange and borderline manipulative during the ""adult content"" night. She also talked about herself in the third-person when she was in the ""other personalities"". I always thought that other personalities BECAME the person, not that they were looking in from the outside and narrating the person's emotional and physical experiences.

# Salutation

I know it's a long read, thank you so much for those of you who took the time to read all of it. Any advice or knowledge on whether these medical phenomena can actually occur or if she is faking them and simply pining for attention (or something else).

91,"people always say to me that self diagnosing is never okay no matter how obvious and how sure you are, but i'm terrified to ask my therapist for a diagnosis because she won't like it and never uses mental illness words to describe me other than 'anxious'. If i do ask her, what if she says i'm not? It's obvious and makes a lot of sense that i am autistic, so am i allowed to say i am to my friends even though it's just an (informed, i've been reading psychology textbooks and comparing my behavior and my habits to autistic people i know in real life and online) self diagnosis?",04Apr2020,1

93,"I've had to move back in with my parents because of the pandemic (school cancelled classes and shut down campus). My parents, particularly my mom, won't stop making comments about my progressive weight gain in the past year. They repeatedly make comments about me waking up early to walk with them in the mornings, that I'm lazy, and that I should go running. My mom will point out how ""fat"" my arms have gotten or any cellulite she sees on my legs. This is really starting to take a toll on my mental health and I'm trying not let it get to me as I went through a slump in February and want to make progress during this time. (They also don't believe me when I say I get depressed, typical Latino parents) I've tried several times to tell them to stop making comments about my weight because if anything, it makes me not want to work out, but they keep doing so. How can I make them understand that this is a serious issue to me without seriously damaging our relationship?",04Apr2020,1
94,"Honestly since sophomore of High School (19 now) I've kept it in check almost on my own. The only thing I haven't been able to stop is the black hole that eats my motivation to work on anything, be it passion projects or schooling. Admittedly, that's been pretty fucking bad but at least I've kept the darkest considerations out of my mind, and liked myself overall as a person. 
Don't worry, I've made an absolute promise for the sake of others around me that I'll never do anything stupid. (Worst I've ever done is whack my face with a pencil in third grade 'cause I thought Dobby from Harry Potter was a good role model.) 
But God damn, I haven't felt like crying, and been unable to, in a long ass time. I've been napping for an extra 2-7 hours each day, only getting the healthy 8 at night sometimes. Broke quarantine with a couple of my (confirmed healthy) friends today, and despite us hanging out, I just had the good 'ol sense of absolute dread hanging over me. Before this I could at least tell myself I wasn't wasting time because of at least school and work, but now my school is down to 2-3 hours of work a week, and my hours have been cut to at most working one day a week. The nothing to do and still not being able to bring myself to do shit is killing me. I can't take antidepressants because of a risk of bipolar in my family, so I'm stuck almost entirely on my own (I have one anti-seizure med that side effects as an antidepressant). I know I'm not the only person in a rough spot here, there are definitely those with worse problems. At least I'm in a physically secure life position. But damn, I can't figure out what to do on my own, and my friends do care, they aren't able to offer any real advice on this. It's not a situation they're familiar with. There's a whole lot of stuff I have to deal with and really I just don't know what to do.",04Apr2020,1
95,"Hi guys, first time poster in this subreddit. On mobile and it’s late, so please forgive any typos. Also, long post ahead as there is a lot on my mind. TLDR at the bottom. 

I am a 23 yo female, who has been working as a waitress and getting an engineering degree (finishing my 5th year this semester, with one more semester to go). For a little bit of background, I’ve been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder (reoccurring), panic disorder with agoraphobia, and rule out OCD. At 18 I entered an intensive out patient program, basically a partial hospitalization, where I went to a clinic from 8am-1:30pm every day for group therapy sessions and one-on-one counseling, and they were able to get me on medication. I was there for a whole month. In that month I missed school completely. After that, because a lot of my triggers and issues revolved around school, and I only needed a half credit of history/political sciences to graduate, my doctors told my school that it would be in my best interests to only have to take the single class that was needed for graduation in the second semester of my senior year. Even with that, and not having any math or science classes at all in my senior year, I graduated with a 3.65 GPA, 5 credits of English, 4 of science, 4 of math, 3 and 1/2 of history, along with other required courses. I had also gone to 3 different high schools in 3 different states. 

I’ve always been an over achiever, but yet I never had to work for it. I never studied, I never needed to. But when I hit college, I struggled. I had a 1.75 GPA my third semester in college. I struggled with finding a medication that worked (never actually found one), I got myself into a toxic relationship that could have ruined my life. I felt useless. I felt like my whole life before had been a lie and I was REALLY just some idiot who was trained to speak like she actually knew something. 

Eventually, I got an emotional support animal, who helped me because once I got him, I NEEDED to take care of him. He was my responsibility. I needed to get out of bed and go to work so I could pay for his food (and mine). I needed to leave the house, because he HAD to go to the bathroom (we lived in the dorms at the time) and I felt safer with him being with me. 

Then, I got out of the toxic relationship. I saw that I was having panic attacks when I went to see my boyfriend. The thought of him touching me made me freeze up. Every text and phone call made my stomach turn and the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I knew it wasn’t right. So I plucked up the courage and broke it off. 

Then, my life started getting better. I found someone who cared about ME, not what he could get from me. I started succeeding in school (2.65 cumulative GPA, 3.3 department GPA), and those feelings of anxiety, the fantasy’s of dying, the migraines, the nausea every time I left the house, the pressure in my head that lead to intrusive thoughts telling me that the only way to make the pressure go away was to bash my skull in... they became a memory. In the last 3 years, I’ve only had 4, maybe 5 panic attacks. I’ve been able to ward off the feelings of incompetence and worthlessness.

But in the past month, things have been creeping back. The pandemic, the economy... I see it everywhere. It saturates every meme, ever conversation. My university has moved to all online classes and urged everyone to go home if they can (I can’t, because I’m self supporting. I pay all my bills myself and I’m tied into a lease). I’ve basically lost my job, because I’m a waitress at a restaurant with ~30 servers and they only need 1-2 servers a night to run to-go. 

Yesterday (or Thursday, I guess) I had to take an 8am online midterm. The professor had such crappy communication with us that NO ONE knew what to expect/do. It’s also one of the hardest classes I’ll have to take while in school.  I finish it with 10 sec left. Idk how I did. Then, I got a call from the company I was supposed to intern with other the summer. My first and only internship opportunity. They’ve canceled their program for this year. 

Today (Friday) I had another exam. As I was reaching to type in a password, I knocked a cup of coffee over onto my laptop. It froze. I can’t turn it back on. Thankfully my boyfriend and I life together and he had a laptop I could use. I’m likely going to have to get a new laptop, but I don’t know how I’ll afford it. 

Today broke me. I’ve cried a lot. I thought that if I didn’t leave the house I’d be okay. I thought that I’ve been careful enough with money to not have to worry for now. My future is truly up in arms over this pandemic (my industry has been highly effected by it, an I’m worried for myself and for those who are graduating “with jobs” as they many not be there anymore). I wonder what has been the point if all of this. I only ate half a bowl of hamburger helper today because my boyfriend made it for us. I can barely pick up a pen to write. No show, no book, no food, nothing is holding my interest. I just want to sleep. I can barley hold to a thought right now. 

I don’t know what to do. What’s the point? Why do I keep trudging along? 

I keep thinking that maybe if I wouldn’t have been so dumb, so clumsy, so irresponsible, I wouldn’t be in this position. But I am. So I must be dumb, clumsy, and irresponsible. I should have known better. I should have BEEN better. I CAN be better. But I’m not. So what’s the point?",04Apr2020,1

98,"I'm a 16 year old male who suffers from overwhelming anxiety and panic attacks, and recently I broke up with my girlfriend that I got really attached to. For a long time we were each other's support system because we both had major anxiety. Since the breakup which was really rough, her and I decided to still stay friends since we both still cared a lot about each other. Recently, she's suddenly completely changed into a different person. She's hanging around with a group of other girls that get drunk and high and do really stupid stuff very often. Both me and the other friends in my group are very aware that we're being completely forgotten about by her ever since she changed. This has been a genuine nightmare I've had off and on since I was a kid. The worst thing my brain could dream up was somebody I cared about so much suddenly abandoning me for cooler more popular friends. And that's exactly what I'm living through. My panic attacks have gotten so bad that sometimes I dont even know if I'm alive anymore. I communicate all this with her and she swears we're still on decent terms, and that she just clicks with her new friends more. She swears that she still views me as a very good friend. But it's obvious that she isnt telling me the full truth on her views of me. She clearly isnt telling me things because she thinks it could hurt my feelings, but the lying is just making it worse. For a long time, it went without speaking that we had each others backs no matter what. And it worked for both of us. But recently I had a panic attack worse than I've ever had before. And it was somewhat related to what's happening with her. It was so bad that I was having serious thoughts about suicide or hurting myself, because I felt so alone. I texted her for help, but she wouldnt respond. I called, and she was drunk with her friends and when she saw the texts, she told me she would talk to me tomorrow because it stressed her out too much. That made it so many times worse in the moment, knowing that the person who cared about me so much just cant help me anymore. When we broke up, we said we would talk about everything there is to talk about in person so we could move on. With the quarantine, that never happened. So we agreed to talk it all out on skype. I made it clear that that would be my first step to helping myself. It was supposed to happen tonight. She said we would call at 1 a.m. because she was busy. I asked if she needed space and she said yes, so I didnt talk to her until 1. Immediately after I stopped texting, she started posting things on her story like ""hmu I'm bored"" and ""ask me random questions"" and she started flirting with the anonymous people asking questions. And it felt like a knife to the gut. I waited until 1 and asked to call, but she said she was too tired. I told her for the second time in about a month that I really needed her help and that i wouldnt be able to deal with this completely on my own. She refused to really help me at all because she was too tired. Half an hour after that she's still online on instagram and i know it sounds petty, but we went from being genuinely in love, to lying to my face all the time for some reason so fast, it all happened in 2 months and I cant even see her throughout it. Does anyone have any suggestions to make this living nightmare end? I feel like I havent breathed in months. I want more than anything to still be friends with her, and aparently so does she, but what am I supposed to do if I keep getting hurt? I dont know how much more of this I can take.",04Apr2020,1
99,"I haven't been on this subreddit for ages but I figured I should talk to more people about this. This year so far my life has been a series of downs and as much as I try to tell myself that things will get better it feels like they will only get worst. So for most of January I was going through a lot of exam stress due to my AS mocks coming up, and despite studying really hard for it, probably harder than most people, I got terrible grades, and with my actual exams so close I felt like I would have to repeat a year. Despite the pressure and anxiety it left me very demotivated, which I know sounds weird as I needed to work harder than ever now, but I felt as if no matter what I do I will be doing the wrong thing so I didn't know what to do anymore. I considered tuition but the whole coronavirus thing made me realise that it might be impossible for a while. Then my grandfather died a week after and although we weren't ""close"" we still had a relationship and I like to think he loved me, it filled me with dread that he was actually gone. I have never had to deal with a loss of a family member before  so it came as a bit of a shock, and I am the most sorry for my dad because he was his father, and it just felt really weird how changed and depressive the atmosphere had become in my house, and I felt too inadequate to help myself let alone anyone else. Then quarantine happened, and homeschool is harder than I thought, and with everything going on I obviously couldn't focus, and the increased stress regarding my studies didn't help at all. So I fell into what felt like depression for a few days, and a lot of emotional ups and downs. Then things seemed to be getting better for a while, with my dad and cousins seemingly being able to keep distracted and with more closure, and us spending more family time together. But then on Monday we found out that we all (parents, brother and I) have covid, and although I am asymptomatic and my mother and brother have it quite mild, my dad has it the most severe and despite the hospital saying it would get better within 7 days he has had it for a bit longer and seems to be getting worst each day. He hasn't needed hospitalization yet but it looks like a future possibility, and considering most people survive it I don't even want to consider it as a possibility that he may not be able to but sadly I know I do and it makes me so anxious and sad. I literally wake up with heavy breathing and anxiety (at times when I can sleep that is), my sleep cycle is fucked and I can't seem to normalise it which really doesn't help. My mum doesn't make it easier as she is the most expressive about her anxiety and pretty much worships the worst case scenario, which makes it hard for me to not think about it and fill my head with even more negativity. I have also been having an unhealthy relationship with food as I feel hungry without having any appetite. I know this sounds very privileged of me but I miss the luxury of snacks and crave it now more than ever. In a way it makes me realise how I took it all for granted but I can't help wanting it back, especially now when I feel the constant urge to binge eat more than before, and we're not exactly able to shop for ourselves so we rely more on essentials. Sorry about the long rant but this seemed like the only place I could get it out now.",04Apr2020,1

102,"I thought I wasn't going to wake up last night. Didn't try anything. Just sincerely thought I was about to die. The only worry I had was being found in what I was wearing, just because my pjs where old and worn. I thought to myself, 
""I should try and get up so I can change into something else before I die.""

However I physically couldn't. Seems insignificant, but thoughts of insignificant value regarding significant theme, seem to come more frequent when living with off and on suicidal tendencies. From my experience. 

When I've fallen, real meaning like mortality, starts to become almost ironic. The meaningful things then, from another perspective, look ignorant. As if I've become as comfortable with the idea of suicide, as eating cereal. I worry people think I don't take these things seriously when I'm like this. Or that I think it's a joke. On the contrary I actaully think when someone's at a point like this it's far more serious. I am personally a greater risk to myself when I become comfortable being suicidal. That's when I start to open my skin, and dream of the nothingness that suicide offers. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, fight the idea of being ok with death. Obviously everyone is different. But maybe it's ok to feel the pain, at least to a degree. Feeling pain has to be better than the numbness. Or at the very least safer. I know feeling numb sounds appealing, feels better at first, like a drug. But not caring leads to further risk, it has to.",04Apr2020,1

I have no one to talk to, no one to confide in, no one to listen to me, I don't want to do this anymore, i don't want to worry and cry anymore, I don't want to exist anymore. Whatever I do only makes it worse. I won't even bother anymore. Other people don't, so why should I? I'll end up as a pessimistic cynic with a diagnosis. Seriously though. I look at my jumble of feelings and contradicting thoughts and desires and I feel like I'm stuck between being two people. Living two lives. One is for them, one is for me. In one I'm a happy, cheerful, idealistic romantic, who sings all the time, in the other I'm frustrated, indecisive, a cynical sarcastic pessimist who is either depressed or cries from frustration, giving themselves yet another headache.

Since Boris announced lockdown, we haven't met up. Just played a lot of Minecraft together. Earlier this week, on Monday he went back to work, and will continue again in 3 weeks, which I'm certain he is excited about. On Thursday he told me on snapchat he'd had numerous anxiety and panic attacks the day prior, and that he had been sitting in the living room watching TV since and even had to sleep on the couch because he was terrified of his bedroom, and couldn't even play his xbox, this wasnt a one off either. This continued until yesterday, but I'm not sure if he slept in his own room last night, but I'm concerned for him, both of us suffer from autism in one way or another and he also has depression. We played Minecraft yesterday morning and I asked him how he felt, he told me being in his room terrified him, made him feel very uneasy and that it made him feel like he wanted to die. Trying to comfort him I told him it could've been that he had bought a dodgy batch of weed, and it just caused him to have a bit of a bad experience, which I am still convinced is a definite possibility, but he is adamant that is not the case.

109,"I’ll try to keep this brief but I’ll answer any questions in the comments. I just got done with a year of absolute hell. I had an unknown debilitating stomach condition, and for nearly a year it was assumed I wasn’t actually physically sick and that there was something wrong with my mind. I was in several locked units, I was forced into doing things I didn’t want to do, I was lied to about medication. My own mother (a nurse) says that some of the things that happened were illegal but that they were for my own good so it was ok. It ended up being cyclic vomiting and treatment is working now. But ever since then I’ve been having a lot of nightmares about being locked in a unit and being forced to do things against my will. Two nights ago I had one where I was in a unit I’d been locked in and the doctors insisted that they were gonna sew my nose shut. I fought and fought but eventually ran out of energy and I just cried while they did it. 
But my main concern right now is that I’m isolated in my room. My family is driving me crazy enough as it is. I no longer have a job. I don’t really have many friends, and those I do have are tied up in their own financial issues and online classes. I’ve been doing my best to distract myself but my mind doesn’t let me stray from the things that are bothering me for too long. I’ll still think back to those times in the units and almost cry. I get upset because I can’t just physically escape for a while like I used to. I’m scared of police, of security cameras, of most medical and mental health professionals because of what happened. And I’m scared to talk about this because I’m scared to be sent to another unit and be put on even more medication. I don’t really know what to do.",04Apr2020,1

But still I'm constantly depressed, my social anxiety is to the point where it's seriously affecting my day to day life, I can't uphold a job I can't find anything anymore that keeps my interest besides video games but even that lately has been dwindling. I have two beautiful children (2 year old girl &amp; 6month old boy) and their mother in my life, I care for them greatly and I'd genuinely like to do more for them besides being around and just helping out around the house with the basic day to day things. But still... I can't help but feel like I'm just going through the motions in life without really enjoying anything I do anymore and even when I was younger I had a serious problem with finding something to keep me grounded but I thought that was just teen angst. But now I'm starting to think that something is really wrong with me. When I was younger I had alot of trips in and out of the mental ward in the hospital for you can guess what... But I think all that was Possibly a cry for help, it's been a good 4-5 years since I last went in and in those years I've gotten back with my high school relationship, we have been on and off for 8 going on 9 years and now we've our two babies and just making it by in life. We argue often, more so than I'd like but we always talk through what is going on more so her, I have a problem with expressing how I feel I tend to just bottle everything up and just store it away which I know is not good at all, so I tent to just cherish the good days we have as a family.. and quite honestly I'm afraid of my emotions and how I feel on the inside so I tent not to talk about that stuff at all really.. But I'm trying to work on that... I haven't had a doctor for the better part of a decade and still can't get one due to all the local doctors are not taking in any new patients even before this whole covid-19 lockdown crisis, so no medication or psychiatric help. I literally feel like most days I just want delve back into my demons aka addiction... I want help... I need help... I don't feel like I can change, I don't feel like I really want to progress further on in life I literally feel like I'm at a dead end. I have no motivation. I say I have goals just to keep the people around me happy to make them thing I have a grand plan, but really I dont. I don't like disappointing the people I care for and I honestly don't know if I've ever really loved my family I know I felt something the day my daughter was born and still feel that connection with her I care for my family greatly but I don't know am I just incapable of feeling those true and pure emotions i don't know. Like when my son was born I was in a bad place and ended up relapsing the two or three days just before he was born and when I was in the room when he was born I was still all messed up and feel ashamed of myself for being selfish like that but there is a bigger story behind that so please don't judge me, I'm not perfect and I'm sure alot of people agree with me that we aren't all perfect beings. I just don't know where to turn anymore I don't feel like I can talk to the mother of my children about this stuff because I don't want to hurt her anymore than I already have in our time spent together in this life... I just want some normalcy and to know I'm not alone out here. I don't want to leave my family but I don't want to stay I feel like I'm a burden to them but I also know how much they need me and how hurt they would be if I did leave them and I don't want my children to grow up without their father (me) in their life.

I just want some guidance or insight on my troubles... Please if someone out there has felt or is feeling the same way please reach out to me I need to know I'm not alone and what steps I could possibly take.. I'm on my last leg and I don't want to fall back down... 

Also for a hopefully more narrowed down reply or guidance I live in Kingston Ontario Canada, but anyone willing to help, share their opinions or advice is welcome and is greatly appreciated, so long as it is positive I'm not looking for peoples judgement or negativity.

111,"TLDR at bottom, though there's a lot i cannot say in a snippet so i recommend reading.
CW for mental health issues, sui*** mention

Hey there. So i guess i really don't know how to explain this. I've gone to therapists a few times and I would be seeing one right now if it weren't for the pandemic happening. For context i've had panic attacks, s******l thoughts, and pretty extreme periods of depression. About 6 months ago I went through a phase of major paranoia after being triggered back to traumatic experiences. Recently though its seemingly getting worse, maybe because of the pandemic, maybe not. Ive had slight hallucinations in the past, hearing the doors open, hearing people call my name, seeing rats run by. Nothing extreme like seeing and hearing an entire person in front of me, but they still happened. Its gotten worse, its more often now and its making me more skittish. Same hallucinations, but sometimes I see things outside my window or hear more creaking around my house, things like this. Its nothing debilitating, but it's there.

What's debilitating is these weird moments of derealization or dissociation, something of the like. I either become hyper aware of everything around me and who i am and my entire past and everything out of nowhere. The opposite happens as well, moments where i don't feel real, like everyone and everything around me is fake and so am I. Almost every time this happens, which is usually 1-5 times a day, I zone out so much i guess that I cant remember the last few seconds, As if I blinked and lost the past 5-10 seconds. Not a lot of course but it's concerning.

Im sorry if I sound crazy, I know this looks like a post that you look at and think, ""Yikes, what a psychopath."" I would have visited a psychiatrist or therapist regularly if I, 1) Had the money to and 2) Had a family that supported me going. Im 19, so I still live with them. And though they believe in seeing a therapist, they don't really believe in mental health issues such as clinical depression and they certainly don't believe in taking medications for such. 

TLDR: Im having mild hallucinations and moments of derealization that is partially debilitating and worrying. My family is against going to therapy and medicating (if necessary). 

My question for you, the super readers of this post here is, does this sound like it warrants going to therapy? Is it just anxiety getting worse during this pandemic or is it something more?",04Apr2020,1
112,"My best friend, a prior heavy opioid user who I believe relapsed, has been missing for 5 days. Life is too much.

When I was a senior in high school I got into weed and over the years it escalated until 21/22. I met a friend and eventually roommate trying to sell him mushrooms lol but I helped him get off heroin and live with me because he was basically living in a trap house before. Given his history or serious drug use I’m horrified that he is dead in a ditch with a needle in his arm because no one can reach him and we’ve searched all around his neighborhood and called his friends, coroners office, hospitals, and jails and nothing. I’ve lost 4 people to drugs and suicide since 2018, one on my couch. I found him dead in the morning from mixing fentanyl, oxy, Xanax, and rum. I’ve also witnessed a death involving severe trauma where he fell off a ramp and split his skull on the concrete and I was the only one with him while he died. It was also partially my fault, he was homeless and asked me to buy him cigarettes so I did and I gave him some free benzodiazepines when he was clearly drunk and he fell backwards over a guardrail on a ramp directly on his skull. I’ve lost others to suicide or overdose but I wasn’t there for those. 

Also, my brother is in serious danger with covid 19. He has mitochondrial disease and for someone with his diseases he is fairly healthy and normal and a 19 year old college freshman. Unfortunately mitochondrial disease affects muscle strength so while he can breathe just fine, he needs more time for altitude adjustments and he also gets dehydrated very easily which is why he has a feeding tube but that’s only a partial fix. His specialist said that if he gets sick there’s a 70% chance of him being admitted to the ICU on a ventilator and that’s horrifying because we don’t have enough and if they have to ration them to the people most likely to live, he will die.

The rest of my family is either 54 and older and all have preexisting conditions like autoimmune diseases and type 1 diabetes. 

I’m terrified that I’m going to lose everyone important to me in life or at least a lot of them. I just got a job at a grocery store to help but I’m scared for my own safety even though I’m in my lower 20s and am healthy but I did have an iga deficiency growing up.

I realized that all life is is proteins replicating themselves. So why suffer like I have since childhood with a sick brother, an active alcoholic father, and my own mental and addiction issues? What’s the point of staying here and not being done with it? I guess my brother and mom but if they die due to the virus or unrelated issues I won’t survive. 

I’ve overdosed, had my dad get violent with me and drive drunk with me, I handled my parents divorce alright and I’ve made it through watching my brother starve to death when I was 6-8  before we could figure out what was wrong and what to do. So my entire life I’ve been in crusts more and I can’t take it anymore, I can’t take all of the death.",04Apr2020,1
113,"Ok so how do I begin? I have what I believe to be a form of pure-o ocd.  I've been dealing with this since middle school (I am now in my mid 20s).  Over the years I've come to rationalize and cope better with my intrusive thoughts, but lately these past few weeks I have been having these truly uncanny coincidental moments that have never really been as frequent as they have been lately.

Now I have searched reddit threads about this topic, and I do understand that this is quite a common thing for many ocd sufferers.  I'm usually able to be logical about this type of stuff and understand them to just be random occurrences, but these coincidences are just so specific and frequent.  For context, I'm not the most religious person.  I believe there could be a higher power or a higher state of existence, but I've never been super convinced.  I want to believe, but I guess you can say I'm agnostic.

I don't really want to get super in depth with my actual intrusive thoughts, because they are somewhat difficult to explain and it's hard for me to write.  I will say though, they range from harm types to existential depending on the subject of the thought. I want to tell somebody about these coincidences, but it's hard so I figured I'd do it anonymously on here. Even then it is somewhat embarrassing due to the nature of them and why they even bother me. 

On to the coincidences now.  This past wednesday I had a strange occurrence when looking at my phone.  I saw this hot asian girl on a tab I had open related to y2k aesthetics and the such.  I know kinda random and niche, but I stumbled on it through a 2000s nostalgia reddit post I had opened on another tab.  Well I closed the tab with the girl on it and went on with my day eventually having an ocd session.  When I felt sorta resolved in my thoughts, I decided to sorta test my solution I guess?  I thought to myself, for some reason, if I don't have a tab open with a pretty asian girl everything is resolved.  Well when I turned on my phone and my internet browser was open I did have the tab closed.  But I also did have the reddit page still opened and I scrolled through it reading.  I saw one users profile pic and it was a pretty asian girl.  So that sorta shook me a bit, but I eventually was able to get over that and realize it was likely coincidental, and not some sign.  Thing is I keep having more.

Today (well yesterday but I'm still awake from Friday) has been very strange.  I keep seeing octopuses everywhere!  I know that's also random, but I'm not concerned about the fact that they are octopuses or that I saw a pretty asian girl.  It's the fact that I was literally thinking of an octopus just a few moments before I saw it on youtube.  Then it led me to think of kthulu.  And as soon as I thought of kthulu... I see a video about kthulu when I scroll down.  That truly disturbed me. That's two in a row on the same day.  I do not regularly look at these topics on youtube, but I want to believe it's just the youtube algorithm.  The only thing I can think that might cause this was that I watched a Bloodborne video earlier and it has some lovecraftian inspired lore.  But that's not all.  I started looking up videos about Carl Jungs theory of synchronicity that a reddit post had mentioned in regards to coincidences and ocd.  When I was watching the video I saw something in the background.  The guy had a plush/pillow octopus.  I know this may sound humorous to some but it's just the fact that all of these happened in a sequence and being so specific. Plus kthulu has been related to mental anguish.  But there was one more thing that happened just about 2 hours ago that really shook me and made me want to post this or call a friend or something.  I was looking at my phone again and opened youtube looking at pokemon vids.  There's one channel I watch from time to time that had uploaded an hour before I checked.  Now before I looked at this  I had another ocd session and I thought as long as I don't see an octopus pokemon plus my favorite pokemon on the thumbnail together from any video (very specific) then everything with my obsessions will be fine.  And then I forgot the thought. Then opened the youtube page and scrolled down.  I saw this youtubers thumbnail and it had that very specific thing.  I immediately got chills and decided to say a prayer.

I'm sorry if this post is too long.  I just wanted to get all of the details out so that I can explain the whole situation.  I'm really starting to feel worried that these are signs directed to me telling me something about my obsessions, or something related.  I know that it's ridiculous and illogical, but I need someone to convince me and  set my mind straight.  I feel strange.  I almost wonder if I'm in a simulation.  It wouldn't be so bad if the last coincidence wasn't so specific and hadn't of occurred in such a manner.",04Apr2020,1

116,"
I’ve had 13 years of my life with the same treatment.
I think the happiest time of my life is not being in the education system which for me is until you’re at the age to go to nursery.
In my first nursery I was locked in a dark room for 2 hours for not wanting to share with some other child.
I was later switched to a nursery which I was happy at and thought was a good nursery which keyword is was because as I found out it wasn’t due to the people there.
I found this out on my 3rd day in reception where I was getting attacked by another child for playing with Lego which the teaching assistant then proceeded lock me in a supply closet and from the start of school which was 9 am to Lunch which was 12.
When I told my parents they went into school and complained.
Somehow the reason the teaching assistant locked me in the supply closet is something to do with the fact that the nursery past over information of me being apparently diagnosed with “autism” (which is a lie since I later found out I have PTSD thanks to the lovely treatment of The education system) which somehow made the teaching assistant think I (who was defending my self against another child) was having a autistic meltdown which somehow by her thinking skills made her think the right way to deal with it is lock me in a supply closet (filled with equipment that wouldn’t be very safe or good for my health if it fell on me). 
Thanks to the nursery passing over information of me being “autistic” I was placed in the lower part of the class which wasn’t even a part of the class as all the kids i was placed with either had Down syndrome, autism or some other learning disabilities therefore up until y3 since the teachers didn’t really care about the “special needs kids” education I didn’t know how to read and write (hence my really terrible handwriting that looks like something a y3 would write).
And thanks for me defending myself against another child attacking I started to get bullied which still hasn’t stopped.
When I got into y1 I was then starting to get bullied by year 2s and year 3s and even year 6s and it wasn’t just verbal it was physical which thankfully learned me to defend myself against all the years up until year 5 where I was easily overpowered.
When I defended myself though it would be straight back to my good old friend the supply closet.
Thankfully my parents made the decision to move me at the start of key stage 2.
Year 3 and year 4 are genuinely the only years where I think the education system was easy on me and thanks to having teachers for the first 2 years in junior year I was able to read and write and I was moved to middle set for everything and top set for reading.
Year 5 though they decided it was a good idea to implement the red book.
(So to sum up the red book in a few sentences it a book where if you did anything deemed “naughty” and “misbehaving” by the schools headteacher or your teacher it would be straight into the red book)
The first person to be put into the red book would be chosen as the class example and I was that person.
Why did I get put in you may ask? 
Well it was just because someone in my class decided that it would be a good idea to stab me in the leg with a pencil where I in shock after just being stabbed in the leg with a pencil shouted fuck across the entire classroom.
Somehow the person who stabbed me wasn’t told off at all even though there was a blatant pencil sticking out my leg.
Through the months I kept on getting put in for either A) retaliating or B) verbally abusing another student for verbally abusing me.
It was sometime in year 5 where I just snapped and one night I decided to hang myself.
It didn’t work thankfully but the few weeks I got off from my parents to recover from almost asphyxiating to death was a genuine relief and I was happy.
Year 6 came around and people started to physically bully me again.
I remember coming home with a broken nose after having my head constantly slammed into a fence for simply “hey that’s a bit mean” after hearing another classmate be mean to a boy in y4 ( who is one of my only true friends).
I came in the next day and the people who were constantly physically abusing me in blatant range of the teachers on duty were gonna physically abuse me all over again for one the many days on a ongoing streak.
But on that day I was honestly sick and tired of getting beat up for simply getting an education.
One of them came to punch me and I hit him over the head with my bag.
It ended up just like in the movies.
I had him on the floor and was kicking the shit out of him for trying to punch me until a teacher broke the fight up which somehow never happened even when I was getting a broken nose by having my head repeatedly slammed against the fence.
We were both subsequently put in the red book.
My last few weeks of year 6 were spent in the same repetitive cycle every day.
Wake up.
Go to school.
Get into a fight.
Go home.
Go to sleep.
Repeat.
The summer leading up to year 7 wasn’t like any other summer though.
I wasn’t constantly pissing myself over the thought of having to step foot in school in six weeks.
I went into year 7 and I was instantly ditched by all my y6 friends which subsequently want me back because I hangout with a crowd of people who are more popular than them but me I’m not really popular I’m just the quiet kid that hangs out with them because they took pity on me.
The friend group I’m with now in y8 is somehow much different.
In summer we all played Xbox with eachother and came back in year 8 and all they do everyday on and off Xbox and at school is just make fun of me for “being ginger” or “being less intelligent then them” (which recently backfired on them when I was put into the top half of the school and most them were in the lower half).
They make fun of me for being smaller than them even though I’m the joint 3rd tallest person in the group (if you go by shoulder height Im the 2nd tallest)
I’ve recently been contemplating switching schools to just have a fresh start at life in a school where nobody knows me but I have been pissinf myself over the fact that I’ll be lonely again.
I’m turning 14 in December and look forward to y11 getting over done with and this whole coronavirus lockdown of the country has genuinely been a massive relief.
I’m going to y9 after summer and all I know is that I’ll either be in the same rinse and repeat cycle of being made fun of but then being told “it’s banter” or I’ll be in a different school either a loner or with an actual good friend group",04Apr2020,1

118,"Yesterday I found by accident a huge porn collection on our shared computer. I was shocked and wrote him right away what I found and that I‘m really confused and don‘t know what to think. He came home immediatly and was very mad. He wanted to be alone and didn’t talk to me. I wasn‘t angry I just wanted to know what’s going on. Since then he acts so strange. He doesn’t look me in the eyes, he doesn’t talk. He only says that he hates his life and that I am going on his nerve asking him to talk about the situation. He gets mad at me saying it‘s not always about me and that I should leave him alone. I don‘t understand this reaction and I am scared and confused. I said this situation bothers us both, but he says it‘s about him and that he hates his life and that he wants to be alone. I‘m devastated and feel so helpless. Also I‘m stuck with him due to the circumstances and I can’t talk with anyone, because we have the same friends. Why is he behaving so strange and depressed/angry? He completely isolates himself and leaves me in the unknown although he knows that I am scared and triggered by this behavior because of my history. I am scared that he could harm himself due to his current mental state.

Also I don’t know - is it normal for a guy with a girlfriend to own such a huge porn collection? He is a very sexual type but I feel so insecure and unseen now. As I now scroll through reddit I burst in tears, when I see beautiful women because I immediately think that my boyfriend might wanna fuck every girl he sees. I know it‘s dumb, but I can’t help it. I‘m imagining so many things - perhaps he cheated? I don’t know. Because he doesn’t talk to me and acts so strange. 

I love him so much but I don’t know how to deal with that. He often acts weird and I think his mental health is not very stable. He gets mad and mean very fast and is then the sweetest person. It’s always unstable but it got better with the time. But now I just don’t know what to do and what to think about that.

120,"I’ve wrestled with this feeling for the last 5 years.

I was always the black sheep of the family. I grew up in a super successful household with my immediate family being wealthy investors/doctors, and my extended family following suit. Everyone in my immediate and extended family graduated college from well-known universities and just seems to be doing awesome. Me, I always feel like I’m trying to play catch-up with them because of choices I made in the past.

I won’t dive into my past/current mental issues too much to ensure anonymity (I don’t want any ramifications from my jobs) but things used to be very tumultuous. My father was a (functional) abusive drug addict and growing up with that kinda influenced me to start partaking in the sauce a little too much as a kid. I wrestled with addiction for a handful of years, dropped out of school and was homeless for a while on and off.

Fast forward a while to the present. 

I’m over 5 years sober and working a good program, I have a decent full-time job making a little more than most peers my age (with no college degree), and also have a promising career in the Army reserve with a deployment to Iraq under my belt (I experienced some extreme circumstances that bothered me, but nothing that I’d say is crippling mentally). I have 2 nice cars and a healthy relationship that’s been going on for around 5 1/2 years. My immediate family ties (even with my dad) are mended I have a great relationship with all of them, and I finally have enough money saved up to move out of my parent’s place and drop a down-payment on a house.

However, I still feel like a complete failure. I am 24 years old with no college degree and despite the turn-around I’ve made, I feel like I’m in stuck in an eternity of self-imposed mediocrity and always will be. I still get condescending remarks a lot from my extended family about how I’m not in college and that I’m never going to actually be successful. I feel like I’ve already given a max-effort approach to life the last 5 years and I don’t know how much more I have to give. I don’t think I’m suicidal by any means, but I feel defeated even in the midst of the relative success I’ve had trying to put my life back together. Does anyone feel the same or have any advice?

I'm a postgraduate student, I had 2 part-time jobs as well now suspended because of lock-down. It's meant my money is almost all gone, and I've started camming (I'm a 28 year old F) to make rent.

I've spent many years in therapy when I was younger from the age of 15. I've always had anxiety, OCD and Body Dysmorphic Disorder. I've done a lot better since my adulthood generally, although I have 'episodes' where I become obsessed with something, for example, last year I stopped sleeping, dyed my hair a colour and decided the colour made me hideous, became suicidal, crying all day everyday for a number of weeks.

Recently I had a brief few weeks where my OCD became stuck on 'contamination' and I washed everything in the house repeatedly and felt unclean. A few days ago I became convinced I had a deadly disease (obviously my obsessive mind is being fed with covid19 fears)  and had only a year to live. I was inconsolable, which obviously put a strain on my partner who didn't know how to talk sense to me. These episodes do pass with time, but how long I'm in that irrational state of mind varies.

I tried to spend time with my partner last night, being affectionate suggesting we watch a film, as I spend all day alone in lock-down they are still working (not a key-worker, but just work for a shitty company who insists they come in or lose their job). They were in a bad mood and said they wanted to be alone. I said okay and went and started camming. Before I knew it, it was pretty late. I checked my phone where my partner had text me saying that they guessed we weren't in a relationship because I was too busy having cyber-sex with strangers. He apologised when I confronted him (I began camming only with his blessing, I'm also a non-nude cam model).

This morning, it sounds so silly typing it out, he made himself some soup. I said oh it looks great. I went to taste some picked up the bowl, but sloshed some liquid out by accident. He became nasty and pissed off at me, about how I couldn't let him have anything good and have to ruin everything. And why would I do something like that. And I just, get this urge sometimes where I don't know what to do. Like a real pent-up energy. And I just put my hands over my ears and screamed as loud as I could. 

He looked petrified, stood up a bit shellshocked and went upstairs. I tried to talk to him but he won't speak to me. I think he is being unfair to me, because he resents me partly because of camming and partly because of having to put up with my erratic mental health.

I was too but didn't really wanna show it like he did.

Fast forward now the recent years he has become harder and harder to communicate with. He has his own appartement but comes over to us all the time cause he seems to have lost his ability to socialize with his friends. He will constantly complain about how we don't seem to enjoy talking to him when we try our hardest to seem approachable.

Later she called us up on our brothers phone crying that he had taken her phone. (Our brother is obsessed with not having any media related objects around so its not the first time.) He obviously showed no empathy towards her and just tried to joke about it like he never would have reacted the same if someone had taken his phone.

136,"Hi :-) I’ve posted here a few times in the past and last time I got some really kind advice from someone.

Like I mentioned before, I live with my parents and we do love and care for each other but my parents tend to argue a lot. I sometimes get scared or panic when this happens and put my hands over my ears to block out the noise and/or scrunch up my eyes in fear. This sort of coping mechanism (idk what else to call it) makes my dad mad, bc he thinks it makes me look like I’m mentally ill. I think the problem is he thinks mental illness is a matter of being stereotypically crazy and yelling gibberish, knocking things over for no reason and nothing else. It’s either that or you’re absolutely fine mentally.

I feel bad mentioning this sort of, because it makes me worry that I’m coming across as “ugh I hate my parents” and I don’t at all — if I did, I wouldn’t be looking for a way to improve things.

Just now, I was washing my hands in the kitchen and my dad approached me because he wanted to do the same since there was no soap in the bathroom. I kind of panicked because I didn’t want to be cornered by him (the kitchen sink is in a corner) and told him to please keep away, and that REALLY set him off. He told me not to have “trauma” about being cornered and that being cornered just means intentionally pushing someone into a corner. 

I abruptly felt like I couldn’t take it anymore and after a while I sort of started to cry but I didn’t ACTUALLY cry, tears sort of formed because I wanted to but they wouldn’t come out :-P then my dad told me not to because it makes him feel guilty.

One thing my dad does is try and laugh problems off. I don’t know whether this is healthy or not for people because it feels like it’s just putting conflict to the side as if it’s nothing when there’s obviously a problem that needs to be addressed. And my mum tells me to just not care about what my dad thinks about mental health but that’s not very easy because we,,, kind of live in the same flat.

But anyway, I was advised to look into CBT and it does look like a very good option but a) idk if going to see a therapist is a good idea in these times and b) my parents don’t really think I need it.

I sometimes feel as if I’m trying to make up that I have mental health issues for attention but idk... it’s not been too bad lately but I just thought I’d post something again.  :-)",04Apr2020,1
137,"Let's say you are experiencing anxiety, or whatever else really. 

People say they want to help you but instead it feels as if they want to change you. 

Like people that have stigma will shame you.
People that are positive towards you and without even knowing they also have a stigma. want you to change any negative emotion to them is bad!

every time I cry im looked at as odd. Now a days its like ""we care for you. you should seek help.ecc""
at first it seems fine they care. 

but then you feel pressured into changing who are and what you feel. 

if you cry on some days they feel as if your not making progress and slowly you start to see the stigma leaking out of them.

Do you guys feel like this?

138,"I am currently a first year engineering student. I also have a scholarship from a government-funded organization (luckily). I am even planning to run for student councik for the next academic year despite how my seniors have said that the 2nd year of chemical engineering in our uni will be one of the hardest.

Quarantine has been the equivalent of me having nothing to do for weeks during summer vacation and me ending up reflecting too much and feeling and thinking about many things about myself.

I wanted the challenge and made the promise to myself to study Math and Chemistry in advance to keep up with my studies, hence, choosing the course.

I originally wanted to take a course on theater performance arts back in early high school, but we were reminded early on how it's our best bet to choose a career path that has more certainty to it: finance-wise, majorly. I wanted to my job to consist of my passion of singing and performing in front of an audience... but at the same time, I thought about how it may ruin the fun for me since it will be my source of income.

Yet, I can't keep up with the pace that my classmates have. I don't have this study habit because I always let laziness win over me. The anticipation, making everything seem negative. I hate this about myself, because I feel greatly towards this with academics-- the thing I should be improving on and preparing for even in quarantine... I made it barely alive in my first Calculus subject, and in our second semester, I'm still doing what I did last time, with only a bit of more activity compared to last time.

I am now questioning myself about my decisions. But I guess my studies is not a question because I want a diploma for myself, even if it's just a bachelor's degree. I have come to a point this year that I don't want to excel in anyway with this course and line of job: I just wanted to finish my studies and make myself free and explore what I really want.

Somehow, the thought and feeling of being under a spotlight satisfies me. I want to be a known person somehow. YouTube has been intriguing me since 2013 when I discovered its magical world. The first and last content I made was back in 2015 when I did a cover of Hunter Hayes' Invisible. I think I did not have the confidence to do anymore content. Whenever I come across that video which had less than a thousand views, something sparks in my heart. Passion.

But it always dies. This quarantine, I have already thought of 2 ideas to post. Every month, I will have some idea about a content that I want to work on and post... but nothing has manifested. 

I feel dry when I try hard to achieve.

I feel so lowkey angry at myself to just settle with the happiness I gain when watching other content creators, and leaving myself with nothing created.

""What sparks joy in you?"" that's the phrase that has been echoing through my mind for some days now.

Now, I don't know.

What should I do? I feel like a blank slate wanting to be striped and colored, but at the same time, my actions don't correspond.

I want assurance and I want to create. So much happening right now. Anything is good.",04Apr2020,1

141,"(Mentions of self harm, suicidal thoughts and eating disorders!) About a year ago at this time, I was a senior in highschool who dealt with a lot of suicidal thoughts and heavy depression. I was in the ER several times but never hospitalized. Once I entered college (September of 2019) I started to make really good progress on my health. I got back on my feet and back on track mentally, I stopped self harming, I stopped feeling sad almost all together. I still struggled with my eating disorder and anxiety but my depression seemed to almost completely disappear. I know it was still there, but it was no longer something I thought about. Fast forward to now, I’ve been home for three weeks since my college closed due to the virus. I woke up thinking about a lot of heavy stuff and (this sounds stupid) started reading a bunch of fanfics and shit involving suicide and self harm because it’s been my way of coping with thoughts of wanting to hurt myself. I know it doesn’t help, it probably feeds into it, but I can’t stop. I’m so scared I’ll fall back into that awful mindset of wanting to die. I know it heavily involves being at home because I don’t like being home, but I don’t know how to cope. I’m transferring colleges but the price is insane so I can’t dorm. I also can’t get an apartment, so being home is my only choice. My dad also lost his job yesterday, and I don’t like him so that means he’s going to be at home (he’s not looking for another job as far as I know because he’s old). I’m trying so so hard to not give into the urges to self harm but this is the first day in such a long time that I’ve had a sort of mental relapse, and it offers me quick relief (even though it’s awful and I always regret it). I’m not really sure what I’m looking for. Advice? Encouragement? I’m tired and sad. Sorry for the long post.",04Apr2020,1

144,"First of all, I would like to ask you not to reply if you can't take what I'm about to say seriously. I have been told multiple times that I ''just don't know what real problems look like'', and surprise surprise, it didn't help. This thing is starting to really get to me and I would appreciate some advice.

First of all, it's important to note that I'm a journalist dealing with pop culture. Watching movies, TV shows, playing video games, reading books is an essential part of my life. It's basically my passion and my job at the same time. So read the following in light of that.

Ever since I was a child I had a weird obsession. At least that's the closest I can describe it. I always had to keep my mind focused on one thing and one thing only. In my early years this often meant only watching one specific movie again and again, because I was almost ''obsessed'' with the idea of liking that movie. Same with video games, I always had to have a favorite that took up most of my free time. This might sounds silly, but it has never gone away and it even got worse.

Nowadays the obsession doesn't apply to specific films/games, but the mediums. For example, if I don't play anything for maybe a month, which often happens because video games don't come out that often, then I'm immediately getting anxious that video games don't drink up enough of my time. To the point where I frantically try and buy some shitty game I don't even care about just to cater to the idea that I still like games, no worries.

The exact opposite can happen too. If there are no major movie releases but there are tons of games, I might do nothing but play games for weeks on end, and therefore get completely anxious if I even encounter a video or post about movies, because it just feels alien. It's a sort of vice versa thing where I'm constantly jumping between focusing on video games and focusing on movies.

This is seriously interfering with my work, because I refuse to write articles about games when I'm in a ''movie obsession phase'' and vice versa. In the past I have rewritten actual articles so they don't mention video games, only movies, therefore eliminating interesting correlations and making it an overall inferior article.

I have no idea what this is. I don't even dare acknowledge it most of the time, because people just laugh at me. Sometimes even I feel like laughing at myself, because it's just such a bizarre thing. And yet I can't escape it. It often leads to procrastination, because instead of getting some work done I'm obsessing over whether I'm a ''good little gamer'' or a ''good little cinephile'', and the quarantine has really drawn this out and showed how much of a nuisance it is.

It may be unrelated, but I used to have an obsession with making lists. I had to concentrate my ideas and thoughts on a single paper because otherwise it felt like I'm falling apart and missing out on stuff.

Is there anything I could do to deal with this? Could someone at least give me a reasonable explanation as to why this might be? I feel that if I at least understood that this is something other people struggle with, then I could ignore it more easily. But it just feels doubly embarassing to struggle with something so absurd.",04Apr2020,1
145,"If your voicing how you feel about something and the person responds with “well sorry YOU feel that way” or “I can’t make you feel any type of way about anything” is that destructive to the conversation?

I am a sensitive person and he isn’t. I can see what he means and agree somewhat but I don’t think that its totally true.

I carried it into a small closet, then stood up and smacked my head on the inside of the closet by accident - in the next 5 seconds I had absolutely no control over what I did.

Wednesday, my girlfriend attempted suicide (pills and alcool, I found her unconscious) for the second time in 3 months (she spent 2 months in the hospital's psychology area whatever you call it in english and it really didn't help her). She's in the hospital, she seems to have recovered without any problem, so that's a huge relief (for me more then her).

Tonight, I should be able to talk to her, the problem is... I have no idea what to say.

She really didn't want to be reanimated (she left a note), so I imagine she's devastated it didn't work and could be angry at me that I didn't let her succeed? So I really have no idea what to say. I can't just ask her how she feels because obviously, she is the far opposite from well. I'm not someone who has personally dealt with depression, I have no intention to die anytime in the next 60 years, so I can't relate to how she feels and I'm really shitty at comforting someone, never knowing what to say or what to do.

160,"Hello everyone!

I am now a couple of years on Zoloft, and it worked for me tremendously!

Most of my life I experienced from anxiety but it became worse when I went to college. I developped social anxiety, general anxiety, and panic attacks. My body was always on alert and I had problems sleeping. I also did not have control over my body anymore, I even got muscle spasms in my neck which made me even more self-consious and even more anxious. I also had problems with reading because my eyes couldn't focus anymore. This resulted that I had no motivation to even study, to go to classes or to do anything at all! My school results would also get also influenced by it. Ultimately, I just would avoid to go to school and sit at home playing videogames.

I could not live with it. Then i decided that enough was enough! I went to a psychiatrist which presribed me Zoloft. I started from 25mg to now 100mg which is my current dose.

It worked! It worked so good! I was confident again i could finally see the world and kick it in the balls.

However there was some side effects: 

1) Hair loss and weight gain but i could live with it!

2) There was also a period however when i relapsed which was thanks to co sumption of protein (chicken and whey protein) when i wanted to build some muscle. This was because protein rich foods contain already a dosage of serotonin which Zoloft already provides. This phenomenon is called Seroronin Syndrome. I saw that a lot of people on the interner experienced this same problem. I decided to just eat normally and not eat a lot of protein anymore which was annoying but it made me better.

3) There also a relapse when I got Zoloft from a different manufacturer which would have the same effects but not for me, so I kept to the same manufact. and I am fine again.

Now I want to stop with it, it dont want ro be dependent anymore on it, I want to live my own life but i have a feeling I'm going to be dependent for it for the resr of my life.

How can i get rid of it? What are you experiences with it? Just lower tje dosage to 50 mg? Talk maybe with a psychologist and talk about underlying problems? Yes I am going to contact a doctor about it but I am stuck here in another country thanks to Covid19. Thank you all!",04Apr2020,1

165,"A friend of mine (F14) has a lot of issues in her life that I don't know all of them and I won't go into too much detail but she has severe depression, lots of deficiencies and lots of painkillers and supplements needed to be taken everyday. She also has anxiety and panic attacks daily and she is emotionally and verbally abused at home from what I've been told. However, she told me that every now and then she has these black outs where she describes it as losing consciousness but continuing to do things and then waking up about 10 minutes later not remembering any of it. What I'm concerned about is the last time this happened was probably halfway through February, she blacked out and woke up on the floor of the school bathroom with cuts in her wrists surrounded by blood. She has been doing somewhat better with managing the cutting but when she does it with no control, there's not much that can be done and I'm really worried for her. Now with this COVID-19 lockdown stuff, there's no escape for her from home and no chance for her to catch up with the needed physical friendship so I'm just really scared she's going to blackout again and do something bad. I'm wondering if there's a name for this and if there's known causes and treatments.",04Apr2020,1

172,"I know this sounds weird, but hear me out. 

Every since I was a kid, certain things would trigger me to freak out irrationally. When I was a baby, my mom would find me trying to pull my clothes off, stretching all my little baby sweaters out in a fit of frustration. Then when I was a bit older, it was my hair. I'd be so frustrated by how my long(ish) hair would touch the back of my neck and get tangled from time to time. Eventually, my mom took me to go get it cut into a cute little toddler bob and I was relieved. Then it was socks. If the line on the top of my socks didn't line up perfectly on my toes, I'd squirm and writhe around because I was so uncomfortable. 
Pretty consistently my whole life, things like that have bothered me. One thing being jeans. I hate how jeans feel on my body. I feel constricted. I hate the rough feel. I hate the bulky area where the button and zipper is. I hate how it looks when you try and cover that area with a shirt. It looks and feels awful to me. 
As I've gotten older, I don't have moments like this to the extreme like I used to, but every once in awhile I will wake up one day and just wish I could remove myself from my body because everything is upsetting me. Today is one of those days. Yes, I am particularly stressed out today for a number of reasons: quarantine, my job, my infuriating coworkers, my dishwasher that is not working, my sink that isn't draining, my online class that I can't focus on, my car that needs to be fixed because I hit a curb and damaged the front. It all feels like its accumulated over time and now everything is in shambles around me. 

Also, since quarantine, I've gained a couple pounds. Not anything significant at all, though. I'm a tall, rather slender woman and always have been. But when I feel ""chubby"" that amplifies all of my frustrations. Suddenly I am very aware of my chin and my belly and my outer thighs. I writhe around flexing muscles in an effort to calm down these feelings that my body is expanding and looks bad. I KNOW that I am not fat or that I've turned into another human being overnight, but it FEELS like those things are true. 
I don't know if my lifelong frustrations are tied into body image, though. Maybe they are. But right now I feel like a prisoner in my own body. 

HELP! Does anyone have any insight into what the hell is going on with me?!

173,"I’m 28 and have been diagnosed with ADHD since about 12 and was treated for depression in high school. At this point I’m almost positive I’ve developed borderline personality disorder due to fears of abandonment stemming from my late adoption when I was 2.

I ask have several really intense and completely baseless fears that I don’t understand. I’m a fairly picky eater and am horribly embarrassed about it to the point where I will choose not to eat anything at a company dinner to avoid people seeing what to order or watching me eat it. At lunch I’ll only eat in the break room if no one is in there and even then I’ll sit in the furthest corner and turn my back so I’m facing the wall. I’ve gotten in my head and stressed out so many times about what I’ll do if in the future I’m at some important function and have to eat food I don’t like in front of people. It’s awful. 

I also have a fear of dancing. I get so much second hand embarrassment from seeing other people dance poorly that I just can’t ever bring myself to dance in front of anyone, ever. Not even once. 

Is this just part of the over emotionality of ADHD/BPD? Is this something else? I know it seems silly but it’s actually quite crippling.

174,"Please take some time to read this.
Hello. I have been diagnosed of clinical depression with psychotic symptoms years back to bipolar I and after a few therapy, BPD. I had trouble maintaining my normal weight when I was in junior high. If I have to estimate the times I've eaten something every week, it would be twice or trice, and water would be at most a litter/week. I  have been hurting myself since I was in 8th grade and my first  attempt when I was in 6th grade. People around me have noticed my quick change in relationships with friends and partners. I'm in my early 20's. My psychiatrist gave me anti psychotic pills to stop my auditory hallucinations. But in the long run, it didn't help. The partners started right before 7th grade and didn't last long. After a few days, there's another one. It went on for so long. I started going to therapy because of my harming behavior. That was a little before 9th grade. Still having randomly short span relationships. Everytime the relationship would end, I find myself cutting with a shard of glass or a blade or a broken pen, basically anything that  would make me bleed. This is applicable to crushes as well. I couldn't help myself. I never mentioned these flings to my therapist back then, I've only told the serious ones. Fast forward, college. Dyed hair, lots of piercings in different places, cuts,vices, and daily starvation of myself. My second serious 1.5 years relationship ended and after a month I met this guy who we'll call ""Tod"". I'm in my second year in college. Around 17, I live in the Philippines. We became friends then went in a relationship. The relationship was fast, just a month and we've already slept together. It was a rollercoaster, we had ups as well as downs. We cut classes to go to the arcade or drink and smoke, we went outside the city to far places, we buy a lot of cigarettes. Then on my 18th, the abuse started. I admit that I have slept with some of my flings when I was younger. And Tod never failed to remind me that I'm a slut and a whore every single night. My parents like him so they allow him to spend the night in our house. We go to the same University. Every single night, despite me being tired from all of the school work and projects, he would insist of having sex. I sometimes fall asleep during this. He would hit me to wake me up and tell me that I'm shit for not giving him his need for pleasure. Sometimes he would tell me ""you're the dirtiest woman that I have ever known. Do you think that anybody else will love you like me? You're worthless. Nobody will ever respect you because you're a whore."" Those exact statements. I wouldn't be able to sleep every time he says that. Then the physical abuse started. He would pull my hair, hit me, choke me when we get into an argument. He would blame me for his actions towards me. He would also yell at me in public. Then came when he tries to control my emotions in public stating that it would make him look like a bad guy if I cried, and would get angry and hurt me. The abuse went on to my choice of being an atheist. Since Tod is a religious person in a religious family, he would often say that I'm evil because I don't believe and worship ""God"". The relationship was on and off
 He didn't like me being quiet and walking away whenever we had an argument or misunderstanding. He wanted for us to talk about it, I wanted to cool my head first before the talking. That made him even more mad. That's usually how the physical abuse starts. Why didn't I tell this to my parents? Because I had the thought that they like this guy so much and would hate me if I hurt him. Dad treats him like a son he never had. I kept this all to myself. I had a party to celebrate my 18th and that same night, he went to an after party got drunk and called me because of his extreme jealousy over my guy friend in High School who went to my party. Blaming me that we hooked up or having an affair. I didn't have another guy or relationship. Our group of friends believed him and decided to exclude me in the group. Then Tod left the group too to be with me. The abuse didn't stop. It got worse after a few more weeks. I started to have auditory hallucinations. He would harass me even through text messages. These were the things I've heard and read:
You're worthless.
You're a slut.
You're dirty.
You should just kill yourself.
Die.
You are useless.
🖕 ( A bunch of this)
You're nothing.

We were in an on and off relationship, every off, I would usually be the one to apologize and patch things up. He usually blames me for having an affair even tho I'm not. This went on for a year more. Finally we broke up. It was hard because I wanted to patch it up but he didn't. Then after some time, I accepted the end of it. Throughout the relationship, the harming and attempts never stopped. He was the one pushing me to do it. 

After a few months, then came another one. We didn't last long. Then another one. Keep in mind that I was still trying to move on from that toxic and abusive relationship that I admit got repressed at the very back of my head. Most of the memories of the abuse and the exact details got repressed and I would only be able to remember when I hear something or see something that would remind me of it. I'm living independently now. A This is my current bf, ""Mark"". He knows that I'm still moving on even after the break up 3 years ago. Last year was hard on the both of us. Exactly a year ago, I had stopped going to work and had been locking myself in my room. Hurting myself every chance I got with anything I can get a hold of. The voices grew louder and clearer. The cuts got deeper and that was it I said. I have tried to hang myself in multiple occasions and cut myself deep on my wrist, arms, and thighs. He always finds me and stops me. 11 straight nights of these extreme self destruction. Then we decided to go back to therapy. Now with a psychiatrist. She gave me anti psychotic pills 300mg on our first session. For my extreme self harming and hallucinations. The meds didn't work in the long run, it just made me drowsy all day. I stopped then went to refer for another therapist. This time a psychologist. It was going well then we had financial problems. it stopped too. I resigned at my old job because of Tod randomly popping anywhere in the internet. During the 3 years, Tod would request to follow or send a friend request  on my social media accounts. Everytime, I would feel anxiety attacks and trauma feeling comes back. He recently sent me another request on ig and it's been over a week. I have been having dreams with him in it every night. It's not bad dreams but it triggers my anxiety and paranoia. He's still in the city I live in and I can't function properly at home and work when I remember this. And the dreams too. Every time he tries to get in my life, I would feel the urge and idea that it would be better for me to die rather than see and hear from him again. I am so scared. Everytime I feel okay, I unblock him and he would request again. I feel the need to talk to him to know if he is okay but I also feel scared as hell. I want to do it. To stop remembering the painful memories. But I feel like I want to get back with him because I ""miss"" the abuse. I don't understand myself. I know the relationship was toxic but I'm still hoping for another chance. I keep denying this idea but it makes more sense to why I cant keep him on my block list. I am not a masochist. I dont hurt myself for pleasure. I find it as an escape of reality and to know that I am still alive if I bleed.  My want to commit suicide is high as well. I dont know what to do. Mark is helping me out but every time Tod appears out of no where, my whole life turns upside down and out of control.",04Apr2020,1
175,"Ever since I can remember, my mother has dealt with mental illness. Depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, anger issues, and most likely a mood disorder. These episodes come in waves and when they do they are extremely hard for me to handle. I’m 32 and my mother is 54. Anytime I try to tell her I’m anxious, depressed, or sick she will tell me “you’re fine” and not want to talk about my feelings. I told her this is hurtful to me because she makes me feel like she cuts me and my feelings off when I’m trying to open up to her. She says that is her way of helping and that she wants me to tell her what she should do to help me. As I’m trying to tell her that all I really want is for her to listen and to ask what’s making me feel anxious, what am I doing to help my anxiety, etc, she’ll cut me off and say “can I speak now because you just keep going on and on” and it’s very hurtful. I then become quiet and say a few words which piss her off because she doesn’t understand why I would be upset that she was so rude to me. She can’t handle any type of shame or negative feelings towards herself because she can’t accept shame. She has majors issues with her childhood and how she was raised, she was also in an extremely abusive relationship with my father and she’s never worked through any of those issues. I asked her to get therapy but she says “they tell me everything I already know”. And it’s just very difficult talking to her 75% of the time. I am a calm and understanding person. I never raise my voice or talk down to her, I tell her how her behavior makes me feel and she becomes so offended and won’t talk to me, and makes me feel like I did something wrong.

176,"I don't know what this is. Might delete later.

I'm a young woman in my twenties. I have suffered from anxiety and recurring depression my entire life. I have had several stress burnouts. This is by far the worst.

I haven't slept for a month. I wake up several times a night with my heart beating, my body pumped with adrenaline and with lots of anxious thoughts that just feel like I'm falling deeper and deeper into a dark hole. I can't be alone for a second. My partner was staying with me, but now he has to work and he has night shifts. I'm staying in my mom's house. Sometimes I sleep next to her in her bed holding her had, because of the anxiety attacks. Or I sit with her dog who calms me down. I can't take care of my studies. I'm such a fucking baby.

All day I'm a zombie. I have to be put on leave from my study, but every time I sit down to fix it my heart starts pounding, I get a headache and I feel disoriented, så I end up giving up. I used to cry daily, but now it's like there aren't tears left and all I can do is shake and out my face in my hands. 

Sometimes my skin is buzzing and tingling. I can't keep a normal conversation. I can't keep any focus. I have zero thoughts. 

I don't want to get into it, but this is all due to a medical problem. So on top of this, I'm I'm daily physical pain. I have lost all life quility as I can't do most physical things. I used to love sports. Haven't done any for weeks. I'm unable too. Can hardly take a shower or brush my hair. 

I have treatened to kill myself more than once due to this. I even started telling my partner how much I loved him and how I want him to move on from me when I'm no longer here. He convinced me to contact a hotline, which is probably why I'm still alive. Don't even want to think about what would happen, if I was alone in my apartment right now. 

I'm not looking for pity. I just wanted to get it off my chest. So desperate at this point that I'm holding fucking crystals and I'm not even spiritual. 

I do have a therapist that I am in contact with. Will soon get to tell him where I am.

I wake up every couple hours and stay awake for a couple hours. I'm 99.9999% certain I have cancer. The terrible pains I have throughout my entire body in the scariest places can't possibly mean anything besides terminal illness and I'm so afraid to die. I'm beyond petrified by doctors because I'd rather live with 99.9999999% certainty that I'm dying than to be put in that situation where they tell me I'm 100% dying and tell me the horrifying-sounding disease names I have and give me an expiration date. I would then just sit in a corner rocking back n forth in terrorizing anticipation of that date. I'm so afraid of this illness going around and I just know that if I catch it my inevitable premature demise will be that much sooner and that much more painful and excruciating. I'm spending every day freaking out about catching this damn virus. I just hate how fucked up this life and world is. I didn't ask to be born. I'm stuck in a toxic relationship with a bitch who's also mentally ill and gives 0 fucks about me or anyone but herself and taunts me about my mental illness. I could go on for years about how fucked my life is. I just want to be cured and live a long happy life and help the world. Now that I would even be a tiny bit possibly willing to see a dr about my preexisting conditions, I'm even more afraid that if I leave the house I'll catch the virus. I live in an apt complex and have a dog that I have to walk several times a day and I'm so scared to. I hate this shit. I just want all the bad shit to go away. I want to be cured and healthy and utilize my full potential to help people. I have so many ideas on how to help make the world an even slightly better place but I can't do shit with this crippling mental and physical illness. Sorry for being selfish and coming here to complain about my problems instead of trying to help others. I'm just so useless in this current, miserable state. What can I do? I also have severe pill anxiety. Pills are so unnatural and kill you with a million other symptoms and illness than the ones theyre meant to treat, etc. Sorry I'll shut up now and continue wallowing in my hopelessness. I hope you all are doing better than me. I don't wish this on my worst enemies.

tl;dr- I'm severely mentally and physically ill. I am 99.9% certain I'm dying of cancer and I'm terrified of it. I'm terrified of this virus and that would be 100% death if I catch it, which seems inevitable from all the grim news I keep hearing. I just want to stop being so mentally and physically ill.

I had another bitchfit with my family for being unsympathetic towards my mental health. I threw out the cliche and childish ""you dont understand what it's like having severe mental health issues.""(Yes, I know this isnt a good argument, but I was extremely frustrated.)

 I understand that taking care of a person with mental illnesses is draining and I commend people who have the patience and empathy to do so. However, it's not the same thing as having the illness.

The other day, something happened to me that made me feel very upset: I sent an application to a university and it got rejected. This caused me to feel very bad about myself and think of myself as a failure. I was quite miserable for the rest of the day.

Now, many of you have probably heard of writing down your emotions as a way to better your mental health. I came up with a twist on this: rather than writing down my emotions, **I decided to write down all the things that are** ***bad*** **in my life and all the things that are** ***good*** **in my life.**

Using my list as an example, I first wrote down the bad: university application got rejected, currently unemployed, currently quarantined, currently single, etc. In other words, I wrote down all the stuff I was upset about.

After that, I wrote down the good: financially stable, physically healthy, mentally healthy, living in a decent country, family/friends still love me, etc. This allowed me to see that there are more positives in my life then I realize.

Writing all of this helped me calm down and become more optimistic. It made me realize that my life is better than I give it credit for and that I have many positive things to be thankful for. And thus I ceased to be upset.

I highly recommend this tactic to anyone who is depressed, anxious, or otherwise feeling down. Writing down all of the negative influences in your life will help you realize what is making you upset, while writing down all of the positive influences will open your eyes to all the good things in life and possibly cheer you up.",04Apr2020,1
194,"Hello, I hope this is an okay question to ask here.

I'll try to keep things short, while still being open, but I'll make a TL;DR at the bottom.

I'm male, recently 19, but was diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome at 16. It's different for everyone, but for me it means that I especially have a lot of trouble communicating, which isn't exactly helped by selective mutism. Unfortunately I am also severely depressed, and I have very bad self esteem, which is all accompanied by self harming tendencies, and (although not right now, but previously) suicidal ideation. I naturally saw a therapist for this, who was the person to diagnose me as depressed. Because of the severity, and because of my troubles with communicating, she advised me to see a psychiatrist instead, someone who knows about autism and its related disorders. I went to my local psychiatric unit, which unfortunately didn't go very well. The psychiatrist straight up told me that she didn't believe me when I said I didn't have one specific apparent reason for feeling bad and all. 

They advised me to either ""just stop"" (idk what that means I'm sorry) or, like my therapist, to find someone who knows about Aspergers. I live in Denmark, a relatively small country where knowledge about this isn't as widespread as in other places, especially not in the countryside where I live. For this reason, the closest therapist who knows about it, is situated 107 km away.

At this point, I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know for how long I can keep going the way I'm going right now. Especially not if I'm supposed to leave home soon. I don't know what to do. I'm trying to do some self help stuff, and this online helpline we have here where you talk to adult mentors about your life. But it's not working. I don't know what to do. 

So, to get to my initial question; before my first therapist initially let me go, she also (although vaguely I think) mentioned inpatient residential treatment. I disregarded it first, it sounds scary, but now that everything else has seemed to flop, I started looking it up and such. I still don't know a whole lot about it, but perhaps it could be my only option, now that I have no-one in my local area who can help me, apparently? Has anyone experienced anything similar? Is it even an option to begin with for someone like me? 

If you've read this far, I'm thankful. I don't know if this is a stupid question, or if I've wasted your time, but thank you. As mentioned before, I really don't know what to do at this point, and I just want to get better. I just want to be okay. 

Anyway, thanks for reading, again. 

TL;DR I am depressed, have Aspergers, and can't communicate well. Local therapist and psychiatrists can't help me, nearest expert on autism is 107 km away. Could residential treatment be an option for me?",04Apr2020,1
195,"I’ve struggled with mental health issues my entire life. I’ve gone to multiple therapists over the last decade but I’ve never actually been diagnosed or even seen a psychiatrist. The past few months I’ve been the worst I’ve ever been. After weeks of trying to get an appointment to see a psychiatrist I finally got one, but it was almost a month away. Finally it was a few days before my appointment and it was then cancelled due to COVID. Because of the uncertainty of when things will be back to normal there’s no way of knowing when that appointment will be rescheduled. Not only was my mental health already the worst ever, but a couple days ago I learned I lost a close friend of mine to suicide. I’m afraid that the pain and grief that I’m feeling on top of the pain I was already feeling will push me over the edge. Is there somewhere I can go for help? I don’t know if I want to be admitted somewhere because I don’t want to be there for a long time. Also I’m not sure how I would even go about trying to get in somewhere.

197,"I’ve been through many many treatments and many many different medications but I’m still struggling. I just started Lithium which seems to be helping but I’ve really wanted to do the Spravdo treatments.

Despite being approved for them by my doctor and insurance I have yet to find a place that will administer them. My psychiatrist who recommended it to me has actually asked the Spravado rep to not come to his office anymore because his patients are all reporting the same problem. His patients are getting approved but can’t find a place that will administer them.

My psychiatrist said it’s mainly a problem with the treatment centers actually getting the drug. I guess the drug is insanely expensive (like $2,000 for one vial which is one treatment) and insurance companies don’t pay for it upfront, the provider has to pay for it first, then get reimbursed. Spravado treatments are like ECT (which I’ve already done), you start them three times a week. So the money really adds up.

Anyway, the treatment center I went to won’t answer my calls. I’ve never heard from anyone about being able to start the treatments and I really want to try it. I’ve been on meds since I was 11 and I’m told by my doctors I have treatment resistant depression, so meds aren’t working well. Has anyone successfully gone through the treatment?

198,"So I know the title sounds dumb, but in my line of work (cashier at a pharmacy), I am working a lot as you would image during this time. I've never called in but I had to today for having to catch up on homework from college and having a personal day. The location I work at can demand a lot from their cashiers and I work in a part of town that's not very, expensive, if that makes sense.

199,"TLDR: I am finally in a healthy loving relationship after moving out from my emotionally abusive household. My relationship with my ex of 3 years wasn't healthy at all. Now that I'm being loved, I am constantly questioning why he loves me so much and why my friends love me so much. How do I deal with this?

TW: Sexual abuse, emotional abuse, self harm, addiction. 

This is probably going to be a long post with a lot of unnecessary background. 

I know age is going to come into question here, but please just leave it be. I've already been ridiculed enough on reddit about it. I am (f18) and my boyfriend is 30. As I mentioned above I recently moved out of my emotionally abusive household. I couldn't take it anymore and left in the middle of the night  back an hour and a half to where my college is. The school has us leave because of the coronavirus so I am now living with my boyfriend. 

I have a very long past of mental health issues. He knows all of it. I recently relapsed with self harm because everything in my life is crazy right now (been doing it for a decade). He also used to self harm and is a recovering addict (one year clean! :)). I wrote a letter about how I relapsed and felt so guilty and angry about it. When we met I was in the midst of recovering from bulimia and sh. 

I ended up showing him the letter I wrote. I cried and was apologizing while he comforted me by holding and kissing me and told me I have nothing to apologize for. He started kissing the sh and I started crying even more. He kept doing silly things to make me laugh. 

I ended up being a day clean afterwards then cut again last night. He again said I have nothing to apologize for and that I have to take it one day at a time. I've never felt this comforted and loved in my life idek what to do with it.

Now I know that people are going to try to warn me about his age and past. For once in my life, I actually have a good friend group that don't do stupid shit like I used to have in the previous years. I have at least 10 different people, his age and my age and in between, that cautiously support us. I have a support system if I need to get out. I am safe and we met through our friends of different age groups in September. I don't want to worry about these things but it needs to be said since I know I'll get ripped apart like last time on here. 

With his past, his fiance passed away from an OD two years ago. I try to support him as best as I can with it, as he is completely open with his past. He has gone from going to jail over drugs, losing his wife, and losing everything to being a district manager and reclaiming his life over the course of two years. He goes to NA meetings at least once a week, though now with COVID they might switch to online. 

With my ex of 3 years, I was not a healthy relationship at all. I was frequently pressured into doing things I didn't want, like sending explicit photos when I should have been in classes, or him trying to get me to do things when my dad has cameras all around the house (my dad is an entirely different story that I'll explain in a minute. Recommend reading the TLDR if you don't want to read more and more paragraphs). There were very few times I felt loved in that relationship. We ended up breaking up for various reasons, but mainly because he was flirting with other girls repeatedly and just wasn't giving the effort I was putting into the relationship. Felt like I was only used for sexual gratification.

I was also sexually abused as a child, so I have a lot of issues that stem from that, like PTSD. My ex would throw it aside like no issue while my boyfriend makes sure that I'm okay before anything happens. 

And now to my father. My father raised me on his own. My mother was in and out of jail my whole life. My dad is emotionally and sometimes physically abusive. He choked me when he first found out I was self harming at 13 and later threatened to kill himself multiple times from when I was 15-17 if I cut again (and I did, he just didn't know). I couldn't go to therapy or get mental health treatment unless I signed the papers that essentially gave him access to what me and the therapist talked about. Right now I have very little contact with my father as I'd like to keep it that way while I get my life sorted out. 

Before COVID happened, I was enrolled in college 1.5 hours away from him and took great use of the mental health resources the school had. Part of the thing my father does is use my financial dependence as a reason to abuse me. He never let me get a job, even though I had been begging for once since I was 11. I told my father about the sexual abuse (from my greatgrandfather from when I was 9-12) and we went to court. He didn't listen to me after he asked if I wanted to take the court case further and speak in front of a jury so that my greatgrandfather went to jail. i dont even know if the man is alive or not now. He didn't face any legal repercussions and I ended up losing 40 or so extended family members because of it. I try not to guilt myself over it. While there were times I was genuinely loved by my father, it often came with a cost, a lot of the time financial. I won't be able to afford my college without my fathers support, so my current plan is to get a few jobs and take a break from college at the moment but pursue it later in life. I'd like to eventually go into the biotech field. 

So where this puts me now is I'm pretty insecure with some untreated mental health issues. I don't know what a healthy relationship looks like, though the current relationship with my boyfriend appears to be pretty damn healthy and loving (anyone want to give out a list of normal/not normal things in a relationship??). 

I am often questioning why my boyfriend or my friends love me. I genuinely don't understand it. When I ask my boyfriend or close friends, they say because ""you're you"". Because I'm a nice, caring person. This is an absolute mindfuck to me. I'm not giving them anything necessarily, and I think that's what bothers me. I'm not necessarily giving sexual gratification, or giving in to my fathers control issues. What am I giving? Love? Friendliness? It doesn't seem like enough. It feels like there's a catch. 

So what to I do with this, all this love and affection? It's healthy, from my friends and from my boyfriend, or at least it appears to be. I don't know how to handle it (I don't dislike it at all, I'm just not used to it and am trying to be cautious about it because I don't want to end up in another abusive situation). 

Any suggestions or thoughts are appreciated. I am willing to have a discussion about my boyfriends age and things like that, I'd just like to not be attacked for it like last time on reddit. If you made it this far reading all of this mess, thank you.",04Apr2020,1

Well thats just not working for me on the days I dont take it at all and Pristiq doesnt go any lower than 25mg.

So I know its XR but I also know there is nothing dangerous about splitting them in half. All your are doing is eliminating the time release effect from the coating.

So instead of being forced to go 25 mg then the next day nothing. Couldnt I in theory taper in smaller increments by taking my 25mg on one day then the next split in half to 12.5 mg then rotate. Even though Im stopping the slow release Im still getting Pristiq in my blood vs. none at all. So itd be a slower taper?

I deal with PTSD for 3 reasons. 
1. I was raped by my boyfriend when I was 9
2. I got into an abusive relationship, both mental and physical, that lasted 2 years with a different boy when I was 9
3. A man grabbed me from behind and started pulling me back when I was 10, I had to kick him in the dick for him to let me go. There was an investigation but he was never caught. 

I am now 17

If you have any questions relating to any of the events let me know.

I didn't realise I was dealing with PTSD for 1&amp;3 until January 2019 when I just turned 16. I only realised I was in an abusive relationship in July/August 2019. After I realised it seemed to get worse. 

In December I ended up getting really depressed and ended up attempting suicide twice, December is the month the man grabbed me 6 years ago. 

I only stopped myself the second time because I heard someone who wasn't me, telling me to stop. It was like a voice at the back of my head. I then felt a presence in the room with me, and I felt as if it grabbed my hands and told me to stop. The voice continued to comfort me as I felt the presence sort of embrace me and hug me. I don't feel like I was hallucinating as I wasn't seeing or hearing it. It was more a voice in my head and feeling/sensing a presence. 

Because of this, I hung onto it.

I have really vivid daydreams where while I'm in them I feel like I'm actually in the situation, but beforehand they had always taken place somewhere else, and not interacted with my actual life. 
The next day I vivid daydreamed and it was me and a man. For a while he was unnamed but since I have started calling him Kai, I don't know why that's his name, it just is. And the daydream I had with him was different too, normally they are dark and depressing but with him I was relaxed, and while in other daydreams I am I guess in a character? As in I have a different name and life, but in my daydream with him I was me. And I knew without him even saying anything that he was the guy who was with me last night. I could tell by his presence alone. 

Before I go on I just want to point out that I am a gay woman, just to put some context into the relationship. 

Following that all my vivid daydreams were with him, and I genuinely fell in love with him, this is why I brought up the ""I am gay"" part. I genuinely love him, and I'm genuinely attracted to him, even though I couldn't describe him to you. He has features and an appearance, but the second I try and focus on a specific feature it seems to disappear. 

Unlike my other daydreams Kai became a part of my real life. I feel his presence often and hear his voice in my head talking to me and commenting on my life. 

It wasn't long before things went dark with him to though. He started shouting at me and moaning at me for doing something he didn't want me to do, as of recent if I do something he doesn't want me to do I have a panic attack and it feels as if he purposefully triggers them so I'll listen to him. In my vivid daydreams with him, he has physically abused me in them. Like I said when I'm vivid daydreaming I feel like I'm actually there, and that includes feeling the sensations to what he is doing. 

He even interacts with me physically in the real world I can feel him touching me, and feel where he is in the room. If he punches me in this world I get a sensation as if I've just been punched. 

But while he is like that, at the same time he did in a way save my life, and he is always there for me and always comforting me when I need it. He can also be extremely funny as well, and has helped me feel beautiful when I feel like shit. He also helps me with my panic attacks and understands me more than anyone.

But sometimes when he does this he wants something in return. That something being sex. Now I'm not laying in bed humping the air or anything like that, but I will just get the sensation of having sex. It used to only be when I'm at home in my bedroom but it happens everywhere nowadays. It has even happened in the middle of class, me and Kai both agreed it was awkward and to never do it there again. 

I do want to mention I do get random sensations like this anyways. They aren't always Kai. With Kai it is mostly at home, but I do get random sensations like this when I'm out and about, including in class. It used to be fine but they keep getting more intense, and there are times where I feel like I want to moan/orgasm they feel that real. It's awkward...

But back to Kai. I used to have other daydreams as well that didn't involve Kai, that were mine that he didn't touch, but recently he has invaded all of them and claimed them as his own, and even created some ""for me"". 

Kai hates everybody in my life. He can tolerate you if you're nice to me, but he still won't like you. If you're mean to me, be glad he isn't real or he will have murdered you. Because of this he has made daydreams for me with new people to replace the people in my actual life. Including new parents. But the majority of my daydreams are with him, even if we aren't ""ourselves"" if that makes sense. 

One thing I do want to mention just cause I find it funny is that at times he has moaned at me for doing something, than moaned and went off on someone else for moaning at me for doing the thing he was just moaning at me about. Like once I was eating at 11pm, as you do, and he was moaning at me and telling me I'll get fat etc. Then my mum came in my room said the exact same things and he defended me and started shouting saying that I can eat whatever I want. Like I said he hates everybody and he will moan at you for criticising me even if he was just doing it. 

In short I feel like Kai is the personification of my PTSD, but I don't know if he is being caused by something else.

My goal in life is to get what others got. If people wish to beat me or section me for that, it just shows their dark personas and sociopathy.

There has been a continuous plot to keep me down, based on perceptions and inner reflected psychology based on how I appear. But then standard templates show my behaviour is fine. And therapists who address these templates have been fine. Everybody else gets these points, so can I. I don't care whom that offends. That's for them to cope and internally process, not me.

There have only ever really been two therapists I've ever liked.

Both didn't judge me for liking porn or admitting to drinking as a teen. or liking sex, or seeing films. they don't do that to others, so not to me. that thought offends others, then so be it. bring it on and beat me then. Or maybe get treated for autism - and I mean that kindly since it's not getting social contexts properly. The social context here is how a person lives unless it bothers you or affects your own life isn't your business. Both didn't scold me for wanting tattoos either. they saw me as a human and not some spiritually-defined stereotype from what their church tells them.

The rest have just disregarded me for ""looking smart"" since ""looking smart"" is some grand universal based on some fool's inner psychology.

Like [this guy has tattoos and dresses like a 16 year old](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zih2hdKBIgM) and has issues I don't have. but because he comes across as cutesy, he's left off. it shouldn't be so. again, smart people who project their inner thinking onto shit. I know people getting a piece offends somebody, but I don't care if it does. give me a reason to care. 

And somebody will critique me for moaning on therapists. lol. so many people here do! what's the difference? If anybody can do something, others can too. if that offends people, then it's pretty much their issue to internally process.",04Apr2020,2

215,"Follow the titles so you know what I’m talking about in the sections so you don’t get overwhelmed from a huge amount of text.

(Intro)

I’ve had mental health problems since I was little (My doctor told me I showed signs of anxiety at the age of 5-6.) I clearly know I probably have anxiety, although I’ve never been taken to a psychiatrist/therapist/ any mental health professionals in my life. That’s the one disorder I know I have. The rest of it, I could describe as a garbage fire.

(Some backstory to certain stuff)

2018 was a very rough year for me. I blame myself and the fact I was unmoderated online at such an age, but also it’s complicated since I was skillful at hiding the fact I was online, and doing this crazy stuff. I don’t blame my parents, or moderators of community’s, since it’s hard to tell a liar from a truthful person if they are good at lying. Anyway, I basically messed up myself and my mental health during the summer of 2018 (Late June to The Middle of August.) I showed very strong signs of narcissism, depression, bipolar, and others I don’t know how to describe. It was often me having one behavior, people calling out that behavior in a negative way, and me being the easily moldable and easily influenced by others opinions of me kind of person, I often became worse and developed worse behaviors by convincing myself I was worse that what they had called me. At the time I was a younger mind and as moldable as a piece of freshly bought air-dry clay. Let’s just say the word toxic was an understatement of how I was at the time. I think being young and online is not a good mix, and I don’t recommend for parents letting their child be online under the age of 13 because, even if it seems like they’re ok and don’t have anything going on, they probably do. I don’t think forcing your child to let you check their phone is going to help either, it’s stressful for the kid and is very toxic as a parent. If your worried about your kid doing stupid things online, then don’t give them access to being online in the first place. Kids are better at lying and are smarter at hiding things than you think they are. I often root it back to the parents fault, even if they think it’s not. They need to understand the fact their kid can access a lot more than you think.

(Recovery from that backstory)

But from that summer, I became a sort of emotionally numb by the time my phone was finally taken away from me, since one of my “friends” online had told my mom what was going on and my mom took my phone away. I’m thankful she did that, since the internet can be a toxic wasteland that can mess up the mind of even the strongest people. If you ever are feeling sad and it’s not due to in-real-life factors, I suggest turning your phone off for two weeks. It’s what I had to do, not by choice. I didn’t want to at the time, but I appreciate it now. It was causing mental harm being online for a whole summer and never leaving my room. I had no phone for two weeks, and I got creative and learned new skills. I became happier. I wasn’t as numb anymore, and I soon became kind of happy. When I got my phone back I made sure to be careful not to trigger myself to being the way I used to be. 

(Illness one?) Narcisism

If your wondering, I believe I might have a narcissistic disorder, since when I’m in like a large group chat or even a group of people and I’m “being ignored” and nobody’s talking to me, I get a sharp feeling in my gut and now that I feel it and understand it, I immediately isolate myself to prevent the harm of others. I’m glad I can identify these triggers. The feeling is horrible, and the only way I can describe it in words is like this: Imagine you have a stomach ache but it won’t make you vomit, and it’s lingering and frustrating until you act on it or you got to sleep.

(Illness two) Disassociation

I think I might be experiencing a dissociative disorder of a sort. I often fall into episodes where I feel like I’m reading my life from one big book, and I can see everything around me but I just don’t feel there. For example, when I read books I often fall into the characters and the story, and picture it so vividly I can see it, but when I snap out of it, it’s like I got ripped from a reality. In my English classes when I read books, I sometimes get up and I feel like and outsider watching my life from my eyes, but I don’t feel there. It’s like I’m looking from the inside of my head, at the world, instead of experiencing it. I used to think I had DID but I could never think of a cause of why I would have it, and I don’t have blackouts or amnesia or time loss, so I cut that option from the table. When I was younger, I often used to think “Ok, I know I’m reading my life from a story book or I’m dreaming. I just want to wake up. I want to look away from the pages, this doesn’t feel real.” That’s as much as I can think right now for that.

(Illness three) Depression/Bi-Polar Stuff 

I know I had pretty bad depression during the 2018 stuff. I recall being suicidal at points and just experiencing a lot of symptoms of depression. I remember everytime I tried to get help, it just made myself worse. I often tried to get help but every time I was stopped by a thought that didn’t feel like my own, and I forced myself back into the toxic cycle. I haven’t mentioned this previously, but before the Summer of 2018, in March-April I experienced a rough episode of depression. School was an influence on it. I recently had a close friend move away, I got rejected by a guy who I was attached to deeply (I have attachment issues), and people at school were ignoring me. I felt alone. I sat at a table for lunch everyday with “friends” but they never felt like friends, and we didn’t hang out, and we barely talked. All of this lead to a downward spiral. I wrote some poems, accidentally left them home one day, my mother found them, confronted me, and I shocked myself back to happiness out of the fear I would get in trouble for being depressed. Then it came back and hit me that summer. But I’m considering I have a form of bipolar, due to the fact I can have Rapid episodes of switching to happy to sad to extreme anger. It’s rough. 

(illness number idk) Schizophrenia 

I sometimes voices, but not full voices. They’re like full thoughts not coming from me, but they just feel like a bunch of thoughts that I’m not thinking, but I experience them. I can tell distinct ones from another. Certain ones go into certain subjects. One that used to be reoccurring often talked about boys I saw, and talked about looks. It often would insult them inside My head if it didn’t like them, like “Oh —- Looks cute today, but he’s still a f—king dumb—s.” Another talked about girls, only positively though, and it was like a sweet motherly tone it spoke in. There’s others, but it’s weird to explain them. But visual stuff is horrifying. I have a horrifying case of arachnophobia. I sometimes feel my skin crawl, I get feelings like somethings crawling in my skin, like a bug. My brain is as bad as to put a spider in my vision, and it’s there. Sometimes it gets stuck in my mind and every time I close my eyes I see another spider, and soon enough, there everywhere. I sometimes ignore it but it’s horrifying. I also have tricked myself into seeing black shadow-like figures. I saw one once and It made my entire body cold and I froze in place. I often don’t think I could have it since I know everyone who has schizophrenia has it way worse. But a lot of the “voices” for me have kind of gone away due to me recently getting a loving and helpful boyfriend, who is helpful. With him I haven’t had as many episodes of depression lately. I’m really thankful for him. 

(Conclusion)

Anyway, If you can recognize if I’m wrong on anything or if you think I might have something of just anything, please just let me know in the comments. I would love feedback since I’m just really really confused, since it’s hard for me to judge my mental state and understand it. By the way, I’m not trying to self diagnose, I just want and idea of what’s going on. I’m unable to visit any kind of doctor, counsellor, therapist, or any health professional at all so my last hope is the internet.

224,"I have a couple reasons to believe why I might have OCD (more on the spectrum of harm, hoarding, checking). 

I’ve always feared hurting others, and hate when i accidentally do. The thought of it makes me so uncomfortable that I try and avoid saying anything negative to the person i’m talking to. 
Example: I avoid opening up about my feelings and speaking my mind in fear that I might hurt someone or a loved one

Hoarding is something I just do. I feel like even little things like a plastic bottle has a purpose, and so I keep it. I hoard to the point where my room is unorganized and probably never will be due to the amount of stuff i have and having too little space for it.
Example: I keep random things off the street (sticks, chunks of metal, etc.) 

I tend to check things over and over just to make sure I did it right or saw it right. I reapply shampoo and body wash, shave over spots multiple times, re tie my shoes, and check if i wrote the write thing or read the right thing over and over.

So should i talk to my therapist about it? or no",04Apr2020,2

I was becoming tired of being on them, i dont like the sexual side effects and i read somewhere that people become depended to them in the long term which scared me. In these two years i was able to maintain relatively good mental health were on most days i didnt think about dying at all. I have been on them since the beginning of 2018 when i was 17, i am 19 now. This is making me so sad thinking that i have to be on pills to feel normal its horrible. I feel so shit i hate it anxiety, depression its killing me this darkness. Recently I was rejected by a girl i felt love for and its making me so horribly depressed i cant describe it. Thoughts that i am worthless and i will never find anyone to love in this life. And that no girl will ever want me that i love back. 

I am wondering, has anyone gone through the same. Is it normal to feel this way when coming off zoloft. Did it get any better? should i go back on them and feel normal again but then i have to deal with the side affects again. Should i talk to my doctor about getting new meds?.

I self referred to my local wellbeing service in the hope of getting therapy, but it’s a six week wait anyways and that’s without a pandemic. I thought I’d put some thoughts here, maybe it would help. I’ve exhausted my friends advice.

There's just a lot going through my mind at the moment, everything feels so much more difficult. It's stressful, it's scary, I feel like I can't cope. I try to put so much in, but it never feels like enough, something always goes wrong. When it does, it feels like it's on me. I know people used to hate me, sometimes I feel like they still do. It all feels so easily lost and it all comes back to those scars. I'm the one who is broken, I'm the 'bitch' and I get it wrong because that's just me, I never get things right. I'm used to being lied to, deceived, manipulated. I don't know what's good for me, I don't know whether my ambition is achievable. Whether I can do good, or what I perceive to be my best is good enough. I don't know how to be happy when everything falls down, when everything feels like it's on my shoulders, when everything feels like my fault. I feel like a bother, like people put up with me just because they have to, especially when I do my job. I give so much, I care so much, I'm so emotionally attached to everything, everyone. I feel like I have the ability to give and to love and to put my all in, but not the ability to feel that back. I value other people's opinions, I never value my own. I take criticism and I've been told for years everything that's wrong with me, all of it taken to heart. All of it believed to be true. Nothing positive. I couldn't give you a positive attribute about myself that isn't completely generic, but I could tell you everything I perceive to be wrong. I let bits out, I get bits off of my chest and I cry. Some days, that'll make me feel a bit better, other days it won't. Either way, it'll all come flooding back, like it usually does. Nights are the worst. Usually taking the forms of many song lyrics running through my head. Tears. Wondering whether during the day I did good, but hardly ever feeling like I did. Then there's this, this huge long paragraph that you'd think ""yeah, that's it"" but that's not even it. There's so much more I just don't know how to word, how to explain. I feel broken. I feel like a mess. I don't know how to be myself. I feel lost. And there's so much more but I just don't know how to describe it. I just know how to give some of it, and how to put on a brave face when nobody can see me cry my eyes out. As much as I want to scream for help, it's so scary. As much as I feel like I'm trying, I'm still playing a waiting game. And all of it, all of it, comes back to those unseen scars. It's why I say I hate butterflies - I'd give to go back and erase it all and not be broken, but then what kind of a person would I be today? While I regret so much, I feel like if it wasn't for my hurt, the people around me wouldn't be where they are today.",04Apr2020,1
