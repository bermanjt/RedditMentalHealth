She went to a crisis center, nothing happened. She uses drugs so they won't do anything, they gave her medicine and it made her confused as fuck and she didn't know who anyone was for 2 days, now it's back to square one. At the slightest provocation she will explode saying stuff like ""eat shit and die you fucking whore"" to my mom, thinking people are out to get her ect all the same shit, she has lost an extreme amount of weight, she is gone, my sister isnt there and she is gone.

My mother has nowhere to go, and my sisters son is only 7 so he has nowhere to go, so they are trapped in that house, the police will do nothing, though they wanted to talk to her for stealing at a liqour store, 5 dollar item.

Crisis centers wont do anything, she went willingly for 1 whole night then left the next day after they gave her meds that didn't work but make her confused.

We are out of options and I don't know what to do. when I was driving home I literally just wanted to drive into a tree and be done with all of this because I can't take the stress of waiting for her to do something irreparable, no one seems to take this as serious as I do, or they are but again notihng is able to be done, the cops wont do anything.

I'm just so done with this, I can't sleep properly and I can't think properly anymore because it's dominating my life thinking what she will do, as I do not live with them, I dread getting texts messages and I dread looking at my phone in the morning.

I see no way out anymore",23Jan2020,1
1,"I tried to go to a social event, a board game event, in order to make friends. I showed up and ended up being so afraid I couldn’t go in. I stood outside for 30 minutes and then I went in, looked at the people, and went right back out again. Stood outside for about ten minutes before deciding I couldn’t do it. I was too afraid. When I walked in I was going to go to one of the tables and ask if they had room for another person. I just couldn’t. 

I will admit it made me sad. However, failure is no longer an option. I am going to another event tomorrow. It’s either going to be a board game event for people with Aspergers (if they have room for another person), or it’s going to be a quiz event for students. I might actually go to both. I. Refuse to give up. Giving up is not an option anymore because I know it’ll destroy me in the not-too-distant future. I need this to work. Within the year I will have at least one or two friends, and I will have begun dating people. I turn 24 in a couple of weeks by the way.

2,"I know it’s hard for you guys to give a diagnosis through the internet but I sadly am 18, going into college and can’t afford a therapist. I’ve been suffering with a lot mentally and I have no idea EXACTLY what’s wrong. If anyone on here is able, just give me the best answer you got. I want to help myself, I can’t keep stressing like this. Thank you!

**Symptom 1**
So I’m 18, and for the past fair few months I’ve been worrying about my health....a lot. Like 7+ hours a day I spend worrying about specific things with my health or pacing my house figuring out what’s wrong with me. Finding new things to be afraid of on my body. Making sure I do specific things to make sure I’m ok. I usually try not to do these things in public. But I was a small party with my cousin. And I kept having to go to the bathroom to check the back of my throat. I did it 5 times in 1 hour. There’s nothing wrong with the back of my throat, but I just keep checking it. There are a few more health things I’m always focused on (colon, stomach, heart, and gums).

**Symptom 2**
I’m anxious about just about anything, stupid things. The way I type has to be a specific way, the way I cross the street because I don’t like to walk on crosswalks without buttons. So when I reach those in front of communities I walk around the crosswalk (usually I walk behind whatever car is stopped at that crosswalk) because I just cannot walk in front of the car unless there is a button. I’m so embarrassed doing this that I usually start to do something else to try and take my mind off of it because I know that person is just making fun of me. I also feel like people who just drive past me walking on the sidewalk are looking at me and they feel like they’re judging me for something. I also feel like they are going to swerve and run me over at any moment. Eating is a problem because I’m constantly counting my intake of just about everything, going even slightly over a recommendation makes me so nervous at night that I can’t sleep.

**Symptom 3**
I find myself throughout the day flip flopping emotions. I usually feel quite anxious about Life, Death, my family dying, my future, anything my mind can grab a hold of and use. I have times where my mind just wants me to go into my closet and kill myself, I never will but it keeps popping up. I have a lot of times where my mind takes over a situation without my input... asshole brain. I sit down on my couch and I notice my door is open, my brain will not let me watch the TV till all the doors are closed otherwise I can’t stop thinking about it! So I have to get up and close all the doors or make sure they are closed. Then I check the oven. Check to make sure the times are the same on the microwave and oven. And it just kinda spirals and once I’ve done those then I can watch TV. I wouldn’t call myself a person who is depressed all the time but lately it’s been at an all time high! I’m still happy sometimes, but it’s like I have to fight to be completely happy. To break myself from my thoughts.

**Symptom 4**
I pace...also a lot. 2-3 hours a day of pacing to calm my mind. I’ve done this for a while but now it’s at the point where I don’t stop until my brain is calm. So even if my legs hurt, I just keep going.

I think these are the fundamental issues that are bothering me. My brain being overwhelmed by nothing, my constant health checking are the ones that bother me the most. Ive made this post over 5 times and deleted it on various different accounts if that says anything about that!

Any questions I’ll answer, please help me figure this out!",23Jan2020,1
3,"I've (F, 20) been thinking about getting help for my mental health for a while. I feel like it's a thing that gets over looked sometimes, you can look after yourself well physically, but does it even help if your mind feels all over the place like it's just not working as it should? I don't feel healthy in that regard. 

I keep putting it off, I don't know where to start, how to bring it up, what exactly I should be looking for because I've always ignored how bad I was feeling and would just think I was tired or hungry, hormonal or that I was being dramatic or that I didn't deserve the help or something, just made excuses instead facing the reality that it could be something entirely different from just feeling bad. But I feel like just talking to someone experienced in this area would help, that I might be reassured or that I might find my reasons for why I feel like this and if I do get those reasons it might be a lot easier to handle everything. I always hear that it gets better when you start making the steps, I'm kind of afraid, but to be honest what really do I have to loose with this? I just worry I'll be wasting someone else's time. Again no idea where I should start.

I realise that I don't really have many good days lately, I just feel like crying anytime and anywhere but I hold that in, until I'm alone anyway. I keep isolating myself, but I just can't even think of where to start with people because I end up pushing them away and I keep doubting my own character. I'm just not really finding much joy in anything, it's like everything's a chore, like all I'm doing is just surviving and I don't want it always be that way, I just want to feel passionate and excited for something, I'd like to be genuinely happy. 

I should mention that I'm in my first year of college in Ireland living away from home. I feel like I should say something to my parents that it might be helpful to be open and honest about what I'm feeling. Afraid they'll brush it aside and say I'm just having a rough day, when in reality I feel terrible the majority of the time and I've just been trying to cope with this for years because I never wanted to be a burden and maybe stupidly I thought feeling depressed like this was just a personality trait of mine, another just a fact of life, it's not.

I guess I'd like to know how people made their first step? What actually helped? How long did it take for things to start feeling more ok mentally? Did your passions come back? Anything you think might be beneficial or something along those lines?",23Jan2020,1
4,"Fuckin christ man it's like every little thing lately just goes ""CLICK"", switch flipped.  Fuckin INSTANT flip.

Even that was fuckin exhausting, but now the ***smallest*** fucking thing will set me off.  Literally flip-flopping one or two times *a day*.  Fuck me.  Add that to the fact that im basically a prisoner to my own brain *and* I'm simultaneously having a civil war in my head?  Someone please fucking shoot me so I can finally get my STUPID FUCKING BRAIN TO SHUT THE HELL UP AND LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE.",23Jan2020,1
5,"I’m 22F, and I suffer with severe anxiety and mild/moderate depression. I currently live at home with my parents where I am happy and feel safe.
However, I’m at that age where I know I can’t stay at home much longer. My parents aren’t trying to get me to move out, they’re more than happy for me to stay, but I’m definitely putting pressure on myself to move out.
Financially it isn’t a problem. I am in a stable well-paid job that will allow me to live alone. However, it’s my mental health that is creating a barrier for me. Currently I feel like I’m becoming a bit of a recluse. I go to work, I go home, and I don’t really socialise. I have friends but I tend to talk to them on messenger instead of meeting. I’m happy and comfortable doing that, if a little bit lonely.
I struggle to go out and hang with people because I’m an introvert. Dating is an absolute nightmare, socialising is tough. My mum and my dad are my best friends. I go shopping with them, I spend hours talking to them in the evenings, my whole life revolves around them.
When I move out, I’m hopeful it will encourage me to be more social, but I’m terrified about leaving my mum and dad. The thought breaks my heart and drives me to tears.
Does anyone have any advice about moving out of a loving home to go and live alone whilst suffering with mental health?

I don't have much that is positive in my life (just my family and my kids and going to my Program every day...oh, and Alex and Dante!) and it is just still one huge struggle for me. I swear whatever is wrong with me has gotten 100x worse since I've gotten home and I'm not sure why. I am still working on getting my meds straightened out and I don't get any one on one therapy yet, which I need. I feel out of control and you guys have no idea how hard it is to control myself, especially when EVERYTHING triggers me. I was just talking about this with one of the therapists at the Center today--she asked me what triggers me (we were just having a conversation) and I said everything and I can't tell when I will be triggered or if something will trigger me this time. Sometimes something will trigger me, but the next day, it won't affect me at all. I can't turn it off.

So I just had to go to the highschool in my town and try to get used to all my classes, take a tour, sign up for what I want to do, etc. It’s just so big, and I know that I can’t handle all the honors classes my parents want me to do and it’s stressing me out so badly, most of my friends have been leaving me out more recently and it hurts me more than anything because I’ve been through a lot of people and I finally thought that I’d found some who cared, but I’m so worried I’m wrong. I don’t feel comfortable coming to my parents for anything, they judge me so heavily and expect me to brush it off, but I can’t do that... it’s just not the person I am. I guess it just really hurts me because I don’t see an end to it, I have to suck up four years of this and then get to college and get a good job just so I can tire myself out and die alone. I don’t see the point. It’s probably hurting me more than it should just because I’m ADHD and the drug to counteract it fucks with my emotions. So yeah, I’m worried that I’ll lose the only people I thought cared and have to start over. I’ve hurt myself a lot in the past, and I’ve been more recently only because I know no other way to deal with the loneliness. I’m not suicidal, but I think I’m slipping more towards that edge every day and I guess I just don’t know any other way to stop it. I guess it’s all wrong and that it’ll probably be fine but they just so readily left without me and it scared me a bit.

19,"Long post, but I cannot deal (or survive) anymore,  Mental health advocates need assistance, too.


Several organizations and companies have begun to fight against the stigma of mental illness. The volunteers and employees serve, assist, advocate, and support those who are struggling with mental illness, including their families and loved ones. Much of mental illness correlates with substance abuse, poverty, homelessness, and medical problems.

As an active worker in the fight against the stigma and lack of support for those who are mentally ill, I find that not only the consumer is struggling, but the thousands of employees and volunteers working with this population. Much of the social security administration is geared towards those who have hit rock bottom, have families they cannot support, are immigrants, veterans, elderly, and/or disabled. Medicaid, SNAP, TANF, WIC, SSD and SSI, GA, subsidized hosting, hosting vouchers including section 8, work programs, and charity care are aimed specifically for those making a certain amount, also depending on their family size.

As a full time behavioral health worker who is also currently a part time to graduate school student in Social Work, despite how much I work, I still cannot stay above water. The income needed for low income housing is barely below my salary. The income needed to purchase my textbooks and pay tuition, paying off a car and car insurance in order to bring me to work everyday, the medical bills received for the therapy, medications, and ECT that I had to endure due to the experiences from this field do not even come close to covering the expenses.

These normal life occurrences, that a person with almost a decade of experience and is two semesters away from a masters degree, cannot be paid barely (almost $3 an hour) more than a minimum wage worker. Despite my education and experience, I cannot live without being hungry or being in the red on bills. Sometimes both.

I do not have children. I cannot and will not have children until I can feed and house, save for, and be financially stable. Being a mother and having a family is my greatest dream. However, for a bachelors degree, vast experience, and being two semesters away from a masters in social work, I cannot bring myself to bear a child only to see their mother struggle due to the mental abuse and ages earned working in this field.

While being in this field - a field that I excel in - certain experiences and upsetting encounters have been brushed under the rug. This is very common and is so the top companies remain flawless and champions for their employees. However, this is normally not the case, although it is not publicized or acknowledged. 

For example, for am entire year, I was stalked by a client who was engaged in the local hospital's  outpatient program. Instead of protecting the employee (me), what is called by the ""common"" hospital workers, the ""boys club"", aka the suits and men running the show, (I won't name names, but the director of behavioral health and the presidents and CEO) decided it would look bad for the hospital and company and turned their heads. I was instructed by the suits and higher ups at this hospital to ignore what I was experiencing and keep doing what I'm doing for my job. The Long Branch police department, however, requested I file a report. Not one person - not my supervisor of the mobile behavioral health program, not the director of the outpatient program, and not the head of all behavioral health at the hospital ever came to the court hearings to support me.

So to get to the point. I'm not asking for a lot. I'm asking for one of two options (or both, if you really care about the working advocates, peer recovery specialists, social workers, case managers, support specialists, ect.) to either A) allow those who are working in social services, substance abuse, or behavioral health be paid more so that they don't HAVE to go to the food pantry to eat or choose what days they won't eat lunch or dinner so that they can pay what other bills are needed, or B) lower the minimum amount for low income or subsidized housing so that we (behavioral health employees) may survive despite working over 40 hours a week with degrees in higher education.

I work with people who engage in services, that need advocacy and resources to allow them to stay afloat. The politicians and higher ups, however, don't realize that the consumers probably make more in SSD, pay less than $500 a month in rent, and still have money to buy the latest TV, alcohol, drugs, or whatever sparks their fancy than the workers who are advocating for them. Burn out is high in this field among employees, but without work, most employees would either starve or lose their own housing (but make too much for low income or affordable housing, for SNAP, for energy assistance, for GA, medicaid, etc).

I understand that mental health is the last thing thought about. The governor cares about Marijuana legalization, free school lunches, and voting rights and driver licenses for immigrants. These, being all valid, doea not help those fighting for these issues. For social service and healthcare workers, higher pay, better schedules, more time off, more paid holidays, and appreciation would go a long way. Turnover for these positions is very high, but with focus on employee health and satisfaction, I feel that the stigma of the mental health and substance abuse fields will only improve. With happy employees that aren't about to be homeless, seeking out food pantries, and continuing to work over 40 hours a week, more consumers will be helped and treated throughout the state.",23Jan2020,1

( https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipAdviceNow/comments/cxo8k0/tips_on_convincing_someone_to_get_help/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf ). To summarize, my boyfriend because obsessed with “coincidences” around him that started when he took an LSD tab. Some thing I will give him are weird, but for the most part the coincidences are not anything I would give a second thought. But he is obsessed with them. He basically said to me one day that he thought it might be the devil or Illuminati and I freaked out. Our friends and his family also freaked out, but he refused to seek help. He stopped talking
About them so I dropped it because it was clear he was embarassed. I believed that it was getting better, but I think after he saw the reaction of me and his friends he just stopped speaking about these. Recently, after he has been under more stress he has started obsessing over them more, and all of my friends and myself will tell him he’s just looking for things or reaching for them. He basically will say things like, his total of $6.67 at Jack in the Box is almost the devils number and that he’s receiving signs like that. Something fell off the table the other day and he would not stop talking about it. He also is convinced that one of his coworkers did voodoo on him because he touched him and then he had a “vision” of him doing voodoo. He also said he thought about him the next day and instantly a bird pooped on him so he thinks he’s cursed. I’ve told his family multiple times and they won’t do anything s they’re very religious and say they will pray on it. I need advice. He is a completely changed person from who I originally fell in love with.

24,"I am a teenager and I have a compulsion.  I want to kill people. Let me explain. 
Ever since I was a child, maybe 7-10, I knew I was different. Withdrawn. Never liked any of the other things the kids liked.

However,  I believe the damage was done. When I was ten I killed my first animal, a bird. I ran it over with my bike. I know its disturbing, but I need you to visualize my situation.
I have no empathy or sympathy for others, it's been apparent for a long time. I've hidden it for years now. The compulsion is growing every day, and in my most lucid moments I know its wrong, disgusting and heinous. 
I cannot deny merging these thoughts into my sexual life. I've never been interested in sex. All if my sexual fantasies involve or cultiminate in murder. At my present state however, I dont believe I could go through with it. I worry for my future however. After a few minutes of research, I do have a few arbitrary signs of early schitzophrenia. I dont hear voices, more like a presence that just symbolizes these thoughts. I do go to therapy but I do not discuss these feelings; we've all been to therapy and know it would be no better than telling a police officer.

25,"I’ve had a history of severe mental health issues over the last few years. Never had a direct diagnosis, actually rarely even sought medical treatment. I often have dark thoughts, psychotic delusions and panic attacks. There are periods when people in my classes think I seem ‘off’ and high-energy, and the opposite is true as well.

The latest development for my affliction is hearing the sounds of people, specifically one person, struggling to escape some kind of captivity. It’s usually muffled screams, followed by someone muttering. I used to hear crowds and ambient sounds, nothing too disturbing, but now that I’m hearing this person I break down crying and panicking several times per day.

I’m worried that I’m going to start making out words or commands in the voices and it will drive me to hurt myself or worse someone else... the thought of anyone suffering makes me sick and it’s hard enough as it is to hear it so often.

32,"So, I'll be honest, I wouldn't normally dream of putting something like this up in such a public way normally but I dont know where else to turn to now.

I've had depression and anxiety since my early teens and have been suffering for about 17 years, a nasty combination of bullying, broken home and realising I'm gay and the homophobia that came with that. I coped well enough with it up until 4 years ago where it progressed to suicidal and self harming and it took 2 years and me clawing my arm open to finally open up to my husband and get some help. 

Now, one of my destructive behaviours is overeating and that coupled with asthma has very much taken its toll on my weight which in turn has made my asthma worse. I do get some exercise from walking which has controlled the weight gain over the past 9 years but it's now at a point where I need to start losing it. I'm just over 16 stone and I'd like to drop down to 11/11.5 stone. Problem is, I dont have the funds or willpower to try diets and I'm far to anxious to step into a gym or go jogging. 

So what do I do? My get up and go doesnt exist and my anxiety holds me back from getting out and doing something about it. I want to sort it for so many reasons but I feel like I just cant and its starting to affect so much of my life in so many ways its unreal. 

I don't know if anyone can help but I could use some.",23Jan2020,1

Anything, anything at all will help. Not suicidal, no thoughts of self harm, just....not me. God this sucks.",23Jan2020,1
35,"i self harm. i don’t do it too often. i cut myself about once every few months, and not too deeply. it’s really more like scratches and i don’t make myself bleed very much at all. sometimes i bang my head. usually it’s not too hard, but i did give myself an egg shaped lump a few months ago. besides that it’s pinching myself every now and then. i think i do it for two reasons: because i have a lot of repressed emotions, especially anger, and because i feel the need to punish myself. i don’t have anyone to tell. i don’t want people to worry about me. my mom isn’t good with these things, and she would cry and cry about it, and i can’t deal with it. i would have to emotionally support her. i have a therapist. i’ve tried telling her multiple times but i can’t get the words out. i also don’t want to be sent to a mental hospital. i function pretty well and my anxiety and depression really isn’t too bad anymore. i don’t understand myself. my mental health is in one of the best places it’s been in for a while, yet i self harm. i feel pathetic. do i tell anyone? and if so, how?",23Jan2020,1

I am 25f. I have a husband, 25m, and 2 toddlers. 1m and 3f. I have no patience. I'm a stay at home mom with no life so I think its contributing. Usually I can hold my anger in but today I almost hurt my 3yo. 

She wouldn't stop whining. Not crying. Not saying words. Just ""wwweeeehhhhh wwweeehhhhh wwweeehhhh"" over and over. I tried to ignore her because that seems to work best and she usually quits, but after 20 minutes of that same high pitched noise being repeated over and over....I lost it. I yelled at her. Told her to shut it. Told her I was done with her. I felt the urge to slap her, and had to physically leave in order to not hit her. After I had calmed down in the other room, I started to sob. Because I hated myself. I was hyperventilating, crying, scratching my neck and scalp until I bled. I couldn't stop. 

Then she came over and hugged me and told me ""its ok mommy, stop crying."" And she stroked my hair. That made it worse because she doesnt deserve my shit.

I just wanted to get this off my chest. I had recently broken up with my girlfriend of almost three years about 2-3 months ago. While a lot in my life has stayed the same (work, dogs, and all things), my life has literally changed completely. It’s not the heartbreak that hurts the most but it is the realization that you have lost your bestfriend in the whole world. 
Someone you use to call and talk to everyday.
Someone who would take care of you when you were sick.
Someone who would tell you that everything would be okay.
Someone who would be there for you when you needed them the most.

39,"This is the first time I address this anywhere.
I have come to point where the internet is filling me with these undiagnosed mental health illnesses. I watch a certain video or hear an experience and I relate to some of the symptoms. Which I am aware is not healthy.  

Now asking here is not probably a good thing either but my parents don’t believe in psychiatrists or psychologists. And they are quite expensive here so I just want an opinion.

So… I will describe all the things that I have going on. 

First when it comes to anxiety, I have it I know. I panic. I can't breathe and my copying mechanism for it, is to just not approach or think of my triggers.

Depression is a thing that comes and goes. I do not like to call it that name anymore, because it was way worse on my teenage years. Now it’s a feeling of coming and going. The first half of the year I normally do great in mood and positivity but the other next half I’m just overwhelmed about everything. I constantly fight about it cause it has pushed me back from finishing college so I’m figuring it out as I go.

So those two are a basic. I know they are most likely real.

Here is the main point of this post.

I have this world on my mind. Entirely fictional. It’s a story that has been there since I was around 10 or 11 years old. And it hasn’t left my mind in all these years (23). I created characters but I have a strange behavior with it. Which I don’t think is normal. 

These characters have evolved, and grown with me like a favorite show. I am attached to them. 

And I talk out loud like them, whenever I’m alone or at night it’s like I become them and enter their world. And it has happened to me that I talk it out when I’m walking on the street. 

And I have gotten used to live with it. And aside from walking and talking to myself. I can manage it. I can sleep at someone else's house and not think about it. But it’s not normal and I can’t stop it.

The best way to describe this is that it’s like I have my own little dollhouse and I’m grabbing each doll and make them talk. But I don’t do it physically. It's all internally and out loud when I’m alone and only verbally. 

And this is where the confusion comes in.
I do believe and feel that I dissociate from myself when I’m in character. I lose track of time, I lose the sense of what I’m doing. But I, to some extent feel that I am me and in control.

Like I said I googled things and stumble across DID (dissociative identity disorder) but I don’t forget buying things, or end in places I don’t recall going to. Or had a very significant trauma, according to me. I don’t know if there are levels of this, or other similar disorders where I am to extent aware.

An example is I am walking my dog and talking the characters in low voice at the park. And I go on, unaware of stumbling upon rocks or stepping over something and or listening that someone is calling me. But when I get to a crossing on the street I go back to myself, cross and then back to them

I mentally become those characters but I don’t believe I’m in another world. I can picture it but I don’t smell it or touch. It’s mainly just the characters. I know their voices, their faces, their attitude and I feel comfortable with them. And when I talk with their voice I don’t think “This is me doing a voice”. I’m just them. 

And when I have come to that realization, I feel out of my body. That tingling sensation of ”why do I exist”. (Writing this is actually giving me that feeling.)

So yeah, again it's the first time I write this anywhere. I don’t know if this is a copying mechanism for my life. And I project these characters having sort of the life I wished I had.

Or maybe they are personalities that are in another ‘place’. Or that I’m not accepting them being a full part of me due to me having all the other problems and wanting to be normal.

I’m so confused about terminology and I have not found something that correlates completely with these “symptoms” except for DID because it’s different people on a same brain in a sort of way.

All I know is. I dissociate. I feel these characters have something of me and I am some of them. I feel they are mine. I even considered maybe this is good idea and I should write about the world I picture them in. But it's not that feeling or wanting others to know. 

Again I don’t know what I'm looking for by posting this here. I just want an opinion.",23Jan2020,1
40,"My sister and I have a 5 year age gap so i've always looked up to her and wanted to be like her. She's struggled with a lot of mental illnesses (BPD, anxiety and depression and a few others) i don't know much about what she has but she has crazy mood swings. usually it's different every day or every other day and since i was younger she's just made me feel bad about myself? just saying mean things to me since i've been like 5 years old and hitting me. (i still flinch is someone moves too fast, sometimes i hit them out of reflex) I know she loves me and and i love her but i just can't handle it anymore. I'm scared of what she'll say and she judges me constantly, i can't even write a fucking diary or else she'll find it and make fun of me, post on social media because she'll make fun of me, i just can't do anything right. she makes me feel like i hate her then i love her, i know she doesn't mean it but it's driving me insane and i just want someone to actually realise how much she makes me feel like shit. I don't have much family (i only know like 12 people in my family lol) and i don't have anyone to talk to, my mom just ignores my mental health and makes me feel like i don't deserve help or that i'm just over exaggerating when i'm not.

41,"I feel like I won’t ever be able to be a somewhat normal person and have normal relationships with people. 

I have so many goddamn insecurities.

Such as my voice. I was told I have an annoying voice when I was younger. And I feel like that’s a big reason why people hated being around me. And I know it’s not just in my head. My voice has always just sounded different than everybody. I’m even thinking I might have some sort of vocal damage from going through puberty. My voice is whiny and rough sounding and doesn’t have any tone to it. And it’s never changed since puberty. I’ve tried singing but I can hardly hold notes.

My body is ugly. I have lots of stretch marks on my body, and I have saggy skin. With a little fat. This is because I lost a lot of weight in my early teen years. And I probably lost it all unhealthily. I basically lost it because of starving myself in my early teen years.

My teeth are also ugly as well. My teeth are crooked, and rotting because I couldn’t ever get them fixed as a kid. In fact I haven’t been to a dentist in over 10 years. I’m trying to afford to get them fixed now that I’m 18. But even then it’s going to take many years in order to afford to fix them.

I’m also having trouble with communication skills and socializing in general. I was homeschooled for most of my life. And I hardly ever had any friends. I still don’t to this day. So I literally communicate like a freakin kid. I don’t know how to respond to people, I have trouble putting my thoughts into words, and I don’t ever know what to talk about or how to keep a conversation going. And I am overall just awkward and weird. And I get really nervous in public, so that just makes things much worse.

I’m also really sure I have ADHD, because no matter what, I cannot figure out how to stay consistent with things, be productive, focus, and I’m very impulsive. 

And I think if I have ADHD too, this might be affecting my relationships too. This is because I can’t seem to find a way to manage having friends and living my day to day life. Having friends distracts me and I start failing in life because of it. I can’t have a balance between the two.

I just don’t know how to handle all of these things. I feel hopeless because I can’t afford to fix all of these things about me. I can’t even afford a therapist. I really just want to be a normal person and make friends, be in relationships, and live life. But these things are holding me back. And I feel like I’ll never be able to fix these things. I’m scared I’m going to die without anybody or ever experiencing anything in life. I’m even afraid I’m going to kill myself over these things because I just feel so helpless. I’ve noticed my suicidal thoughts getting worse over this past year.",23Jan2020,1

44,"It’s part of my cycle. 

The exhausting loop I’ve gone through for so many years. 6 years ago is when I can pinpoint the start of the cycle. When I was 16 and was kicked out of my moms house. When I spent all my time is some ladies basement until I started getting scared all the time. 
When I first discovered drugs &amp; alcohol. 

It all needed to happen. I will turn this pain to beauty one day. I fucking will. There’s too much pain to be turned into beauty to just waste it. This could be beautiful.. but right now it’s ugly. It leaves me lifeless, wild, and decrepit. 

It’s something that tips me over the edge. It’s something no amount of therapy sessions, yoga, journaling, or art can help. Every broken heart I’ve had, every argument with my mother, every humiliating moment, every bad bad mistake. It leads me to this. 

To the drugs, to the alcohol. But only for a few weeks. My senses start to kick in &amp; I realize what it’s all doing to me. All the adrenaline rushes, dangerous sex, mental break downs, blackouts &amp; lines always lead me to this. To a feeling that opens my eyes. I can’t be here. I shouldn’t be here. I’m not comfortable being here. 


So I leave the bar. So I go home. So I ghost that person.... but now, without it all, I’m left with the numbness. With the mania. With the word vomit. With the reality that I don’t want to be close with anyone. I want to get off the couch, but I can’t. I want to feel my feelings but I can’t. It’s like I’m running to freedom &amp; success full speed, but end up running into a glass door I couldn’t see. My body hurts. That’s the worst part. The depression where your body is just in fucking pain. How can I feel anything? How can I feel alive or think logically when my body is just pain. I’ve been feeding it. Giving it vitamins &amp; water. Stretching it. But my body, it’s still weighing me down. 

I think if I can free my mind from being weighed down, then I can free my body. 

But how can I free my mind when it just Longs to be numb. I want to be brave. I want to feel something. I want to do art &amp; get lost in it. Watch a movie &amp; cry. Feel a connection with a person. Take a shower that feels amazing. 

But I’m numb &amp; feel like a brick. Even my breathing has no meaning. 

I want to feel alive. But every good feeling gets shut down. I can literally feel it being shut down. Laughing with someone? Shut down. I’m so scared. 

I’m so fucking scared. 

If I can’t get in touch with these feelings &amp; with life &amp; energy &amp; meaningfulness I’m going to keep being destructive &amp; stupid. Keep calling off work &amp; not paying my rent. Keep my house dirty &amp; never change my sheets. 

No one deserves to be around a person like me. But I like it. Please stay away. Please stay away. I don’t trust you &amp; you shouldn’t trust me. You’ll play mind games &amp; so will I. Well both go crazy, so stay away. 

So all in all, I know what makes me feel alive. What I need to do. I know the answers. The therapy, the accepting, the meditation. This weird in between those things &amp; my destructive horrible self is the worst. Ide rather have one or the other. And I’m scared if I don’t get to the one I’ll go to the other. 

I’m scared. I’m scared to feel alive. I’m scared to utilize all the mental habits &amp; things that made me good at one point. I know what to do, but I’m so scared. It drives me fucking crazy &amp; I get manic as hell. 


If you have read all of this I would like to Thank you very much. It feels as though I have 3 sides of me. Good, Bad &amp; the mania in between. 

If you relate to anything I have said I wish you strength &amp; perseverance. There’s beauty all around us &amp; I know how fucking hard &amp; annoying it is to accept it. Thank you.",23Jan2020,1
45,"They have self-harmed once before and are working against it, but they confided to me yesterday that they are struggling to keep it up. They do not feel safe confiding to their parents and the school counselors we have are not the best. They have asked me not to contact any authorities. They have confided in me once before, and I do my best to respond calmly and non-judgmentally, just letting them rant and doing my best to console them. However, I feel terrible about not being able to do enough to help and I'm constantly scared of doing or saying the wrong thing that might push them over the edge.

They tell me they constantly hide their emotions behind a fake smile, and this has been bugging me for some time. I've been wondering if they are ever happy, or if everything I thought I knew about them is a lie. I don't know if I am friends with them, or with their ""fake self"", which they explicitly hate having to put up as a facade. I thought I could cheer them up but now I don't know if it ever really worked. Are they constantly sad? I can't imagine what they put up with everyday and I just wish I could fix it somehow. I feel bad that I like their ""fake self"" and I hate that I am annoyed by their ""real self"". Of course I would never leave their side, especially not with what they are going through, but some small part of me can't help but feel annoyed that I have to deal with their emotions and problems, and then I feel ashamed and guilty on top of feeling worried and scared and sad.

I just don't know what to do, about their situation, about how I can deal with my emotions, and I generally feel lost. Reddit, have any of you gone through something similar and can offer some insight? What should/can I do to help them, and help me keep my sanity through this? I would really appreciate it.

47,"19F

I dropped out of an ivy league school because my grades were bad enough to get me kicked out if I stayed another semester. I realized just how much I hate school and I don't think I'll be transferring anywhere else. I went home and it didn't feel like home. It felt like there wasn't a place for me there anymore. Something about it just doesn't feel like home anymore. I feel like my mother and siblings are a family and I'm an outsider. 

All my friends are in college and as a new dropout, the divide seems to get bigger every day and they seem uninterested in talking to me because we don't have that much in common anymore. I'm broke and in debt. I got a job as a waitress. Less for the money and more to run away from my problems. Now I work 10hrs a day and bring home something less than a grocery trip's worth of money. 

My family is originally from another country. We can't afford frequent trips back home and we've only gone back once. I had school and I was very engrossed in trying to get into a good college and thus I didn't go back. Now that I want to, I can't even do it. I'm at a weird position where my home country is iffy about my dual citizenship with my new country and it's a pain to travel overseas with either sets of documents. I want to see my dad really bad. It's been 6 years. I don't even think he remembers what I look like. The rest of my family is going back but my documents are being blocked. I don't know what to do. It feels like I'll never see my dad again.

I feel like I don't know where I'm going with my life. I used to like writing but now I don't anymore. It's becoming painful to express myself and I dread putting any personal touch in my work. I tried out engineering and math and I failed so bad that I don't even have a college degree. I tried computer science and it went pretty well for a while. I even got an internship at a brand name company and felt like it was going to work out but I hated it and couldn't stand up to my competition. 

I have a lot of trouble with expressing myself emotionally. It makes me turn down romantic partners and friends. I'm a private person and it turns others away from me when I don't want to share about my life. I don't know why, but I prefer one night stands with no emotional attachments and very detached friendships. It hurts me a lot and I've lost friends and people I genuinely like for being so aloof. I've had pretty strong feelings for this one boy for nearly a year now and I just don't have the heart to tell him. I slept with him then pretty much disposed of him and now he hates me. 

I don't care about anything anymore. I've genuinely tried but it fails every time. It feels like a lack of self restraint when it comes to doing things that have consequences. I missed my finals and didn't care about failing classes. I sped into oncoming traffic and even when I was stopped by a cop, I didn't feel the need to apologize or try to explain it. It's hard to explain but it's like a feeling of being done with everything and everyone. It's freeing to speak my mind but at the same time, I'm afraid I'll go to far. 

I'm quite patient with others but I have anger issues. I can't relax my brow. I've punched holes through walls. I can't stop myself from being inwardly enraged by small things. I don't know how to let it go. 

I have crippling depression. I couldn't get out of bed for the better parts of October, November and December of last year. I don't feel comfortable telling my friends about it. My mom and I have never been close and she's a very church type so I didn't want to tell her. I was afraid to go home for Christmas because my family would see just how sickly I was. Therapy and medication worked for a while then just didn't. I came home and it went away for a while then came back. I found a job and now I work really long hours every day so I won't feel it but the truth is, I can't do this forever. 

 I think I am going crazy. I feel like I am slowly losing my mind. Sometimes, I can't tell the difference between reality and my imagination. I'm forgetting things that happened and remembering things that never happened very vividly. I am in a lot of pain all the time. Recently, I've began to go into bursts of uncontrollable crazy sounding laughter then just stop suddenly. Sometimes I can't tell if I just laughed or not but I'll see people look at me weirdly when I'm in public. I get very sudden mood swings sometimes. I have suicidal and murderous thoughts almost habitually. I've lost all sense of consequence, time and logic. I can't reason with myself anymore. I know it's wrong but I don't see the problem in things like getting kicked out of school or getting into head on collisions. I don't notice day or night anymore. I go days without a proper meal. It feels like mental masochism but I don't know how to stop it. 

I don't feel alive.",23Jan2020,1

51,"Hey everyone. I need some help.

So I've recently been unofficially diagnosed with clinical depression and I don't know how to tell my parents.

So far I've said the words, ""clinical depression"" to them but I was met with confusion and ""What?! No you don't!"" and since then they've acted like it never even happened. I just want help. I don't want to feel this way anymore and they won't seem to listen.

I've had breakdowns, panic attacks, and long depressive episodes with no one to up until a couple of weeks ago, to talk to. I've done therapy, meds, diaries, pushing my feelings, and talking it out with friends. Since then, I've gone through 4 therapists, tons of meds, discontinued diaries, pushed my feelings til they've burst, and I've lost all my friends. I'm drowning and my parents can't even see it. 

Without getting into the gory details I just wanted to say that I've had suicidal thoughts and self-harmed. They don't know any of this. How do I tell them and how can I let them help me?

52,"Been wanting to vent for a while, but kept putting it off. 

I just don't feel fit for this world. I'd wish I'd just disappear in a way. Escape from this reality and never return. I don't think I want to kill myself, I just don't want to be alive. 

For the entirety of my life (since 3 yrs old) I've had a problem where I'd get sick/nauseous at night. As I got older I thought it was going away and eventually I wouldn't have this be a huge concern. But before my senior year in hs, it came back hard. I had trouble eating and I ended up losing weight. I'm already underweight and had been trying to gain weight, and this scared me. Eventually it passed to a degree, and I was able to eat normally again.

But since the start of college, its come back again and it's so much worse. Last quarter I was constantly throwing away my food and shifting the food in our family dish so when my parents came home they didn't ask too many questions. I frequently felt ill at school and am too afraid to eat there. I'm so consumed by this fear of vomiting and feelings of nausea that I cannot shake off to the point where I can't bring myself to eat. I lost 5 pounds in 5ish weeks, something that took me fucking months to gain. 

On top of this I'm so socially inept. I don't know what to say and feel I need to script everything before approaching a conversation, but even then it doesn't work. It took me 30 minutes to enter a room where I had prearranged a meeting with a teacher. 

How can I function in a world I cannot handle? How can I expect myself to make it any farther in my college years or life like this? Undoubtedly the work will become harder. I have to make buddy with my professors if I ever have any hopes of grad school. How can I even imagine handling that when an upcoming quiz or test throws my body out of wack? I can't see myself living past 25 or so (18 now). I always imagine I somehow end up on the streets one way or another. 

Everything just seems so stressful. I'm not built for this. My parents won't allow me to go anywhere when schools around and even during breaks its hard getting out with my friends. I've only done this twice in my life. I don't have a life and I can't see myself making one anytime soon. 

I just want to die off and be free and I hate it but I also don't and I don't know what to think anymore. I should probably be seeing a therapist but my mom has problems with it. 

I can't take this anymore. I know I'm not eating enough but I can't force myself to eat. The world is just a big bundle of stress and I can't handle it, nor do I want to. I don't feel I can do this any longer and I don't know how to feel about it.",23Jan2020,1
53,"I know deep down, I need to go check myself into a mental facility before I seriously hurt someone. I know I'll get disowned by all my family and friends once they find out, so I'll have absolutely no support system once I'm in there and when I get out. My horrible thoughts are getting out of control. 
I've had really bad thoughts about hurting people not just hurting them a little either. I mean there's one particular person who I can't stand whenever she's around I visualise how her murder would go down and how I would destroy all evidence, and rid of the body so I wouldn't get done the murder. I've caught myself grabbing a knife and going to stab her when she's got her back turned to me. I've had to stop myself a few times

54,"I don’t really know how to start this so I’m just gonna jump in.

I self harmed in the past (about a year clean) but that was the worst mistake I have ever made, it feels like I opened a door when I started that because now I know I can hurt myself and how easy it would be to kill myself. I’ve been staying up till 5am every night and sleeping till 12pm. I feel like I have no use in life and I’ll never go anywhere because my parents decided they didn’t want to enroll me in school when I was little. I’ve never left the house I’m not even allowed to walk down the sidewalk. I live in a good neighborhood and have overall been a trustworthy child. Sorry about that I guess I’m rambaling a bit.
I need help. I’m suicidal and overall hate myself. I’ve tried to figure out how to fix this on my own but I just can’t. I need a therapist I know but my family cannot afford one. It’s honestly getting too hard for me. If something doesn’t change soon I don’t know how I’ll live. I need options please.",23Jan2020,1
55,"Hi all, I'm curious if anyone has input, possibly from personal experience or counseling someone in this type of situation. 

I have a friend who isn't on medication or therapy for depression, and they've dealt with a lot of trauma in their life as far as I can tell.

When they have a breakdown, they talk about how they've hurt people and pushed people away and that they don't deserve to be happy. Also lots of negative self image and self worth comments. I do my best to listen and I try to offer thoughts sparingly on how they're not alone in having hurt people but they deserve to be happy nonetheless, but is there anything I can do better? Is that too smothering to say? 

Also for my own mental health where should my boundary be in trying to help?

Thanks all",23Jan2020,1
56,"So many people don’t understand what it’s like, so I mostly hide it. Especially since I have no apparent reason for how I’m feeling. People want to know what is causing it. It’s just my broken brain, but that doesn’t seem to be an acceptable answer. Or they want to tell me what to do. Meditate, practice gratitude, take some supplement, etc, etc. I’ve tried most of that and I don’t feel like explaining everything I’ve tried over and over. Or worse are the people that think I just need to buck up and deal with it, just overcome it, as if it’s that easy. Too many people see mental health as more of a personal problem than an actual illness. I wish I could tell my employer, hey I need to go home early today because I’m getting overwhelmed and I feel a melt down coming on. But I would never do that. I’d feel embarrassed to admit it, and they wouldn’t understand anyway. So I go through my day, smile through the pain, answer “Im fine” when someone says “how are you?”. I’d have to fake a “real” illness if I needed to leave. So I try to have my meltdowns in private and keep it all to myself, but it’s hard and it’s lonely.",23Jan2020,1
57,"I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (21M) for about a year. I love him immensely and can’t think about being happy with anyone else. He has suffered from depression, anxiety, bipolar and borderline personality disorder for a long time. At the start of my relationship, he made these issues known to me and I was willing to stick it out, and we had a conversation again about his mental health usually worsening around wintertime. 
We broke up for about three weeks because his depression was so bad, he was afraid of hurting me and letting me down, and his bpd which causes him to push people away. We got back together, but I don’t know if I can do it anymore, and I feel terrible for thinking that. 
I don’t want him, his family, or our friends and coworkers (we work at the same place) to think I’m a coward or that I gave up on him or can’t handle his mental illness, or am being selfish by leaving him. But I’ve noticed his worsening mental health has started to take a toll on me, and brought up stress and anxiety that has never been this bad for me before. I’m only 21, and frequently worrying about whether or not he’s alive. One day he tells me he loves me 25 times and wants to marry me one day and the next he’s totally apathetic and I feel like he doesn’t even want to speak to me or be with me. I know I can’t fully understand what he’s going through and I feel awful that I don’t feel like I can handle it anymore, because I genuinely want to be there for him so he isn’t alone.

I'm just gonna say what i did cuz i truly have nothing left to lose: I sent a nude pic of a girl i went out with for a week to a group of 4 guys (all close friends) and another of my ex to a friend of mine. Writing this and confessing it to a bunch of strangers feel horrible but i don't wanna hide anymore in guilt. This went public back in summer of 2018 (i did this in mid 2017) im 24 now and can see this was a horrible mistake, i haven't done anything stupid since but whenever i post a song or try to get in a band eventually people turn on me or straight up shit on me. When this went public a bunch of ppl called my phone and sent hate messages telling me i was gonna get locked up, i got paranoid and only confessed one side of the truth which was that i sent 1 pic of my ex to a friend and that i spoke to my ex and she didn't had a problem with it. But the other girl which started saying this even called my mom and she only wanted me to apologize to her but I chickened the fuck out and didn't want to confess to her that I did it. As years went by i kept this side of the truth to my self but the guilt kept eating my alive and so when my last band heard ppl speakin about this they wanted me to tell the truth so I took this as an opportunity to finally admit to them and myself that i did in fact sent that photo to a group chat without consent. Ppl went as far as to say that i raped someone which was all bullshit but for me to truly be capable to defend myself i figured i needed to hold my self accountable to everything that i did. To wrap things up, my band decided to part ways from the label which wanted to continue with them but without me and also parted ways from me cuz they didn't wanted any problems in the future regarding this knowing how strict cancel culture is. Now I feel like shit cuz i loved the band, the people involved and everything seemed to be lookin up for me but I feel like I've reached rock bottom again. I have no job I'm still makin music by myself tho but everytime i release something with my own project ppl call me out and im sick of it. Im thinking of killing myself becuz i feel that mistake is gonna keep haunting me for the rest of my life and career or turning myself in into prison or something since it seems its a crime in my country idk tbh. Im at a lost i don't rly want to do anything else, i love music and im willing to spend time in jail if that's what i gotta do to clean my name. I go to therapy, i know im now a better person im not an abuser and no longer do that kind of shit to women but ppl hate me so much its unbearable.

I have trouble sleeping. I can't seem to want to sleep before 1 AM, even if I need to be up early. I also (albeit rarely nowadays) get sleep paralysis and nightmares, which in turn make me not want to sleep. This happened last night. I am nyctophobic, and can't sleep without a light on, due to one particularly bad experience.
Because of all these factors, I am constantly exhausted and can't always think straight.

60,"This started a little over four years ago; where my right eustachian tube would pop several hundreds, thousands, or even several thousands of times in a day, like the feeling of going into an airplane. I'm tired of it. You can image how it's changed my outlook on life. The thing is; this is most likely some sort of psychogenic movement disorder. It's cause by anxiety, not an anatomical issue. 

I haven't been able to get my mind of these two girls I met around the time my ear started popping. They're identical twin sisters and cupid struck me with 2 arrows when I laid my eyes on them. I haven't talked to either of these two girls in close to 2 years now because an attempted relationship with one of them had failed. I have been told it's best not to talk to them and I've been severely suffering for years.

I can't stop loving them. It feels like a psychotic love. I'm still a virgin and I've masturbated to their facebook pictures well over a thousand times over the course of these past years. These numbers aren't exaggerated. I keep getting feelings of jealousy as if they've found other guys, though I know little to nothing about where they're at in life because the lack of contact. I never once found out if they were virgins or not, which drives me crazy because I want to know out of jealousy. The fear of the unknown drives me insane. 

I see my ego, but I can't see around my ego. I can't stop wanting to have sex with one of these twins. I want to marry her. She's too cute. Of course I love her personality, too. I would do anything. My ear won't stop popping. I can't stand the no contact. It's been years and I haven't let go. I'll never want to let go until I don't see the value in her it feels.

61,"         Since I'm in a break from school and everything, the discomfort I have for idea of doing nothing and letting the time pass by made me prepare a to do list (or ""friendly advices"" as I toned it down). 


          So far so good, it's nice not to be lazy all day and have a productive holiday. It's like having me time but double of it because it's actually also very good for me. I'm kind of a person that has to be tired physically at the end of the day or else feels down. And it leads to over thinking. And not in a good way. 


          But...I...feel...not...very...good. Not feeling good also makes me feel guilty because right now I'm surrounded by people that I love and cares about me a lot. And I'm also confused because I am taking my own friendly advices every day and it makes me feel very strong and successful. I'm also having very good time with people I couldn't see during my school year. Then, why? is the question I ask.


          Sometimes it's scary to be a human being. Because it has a great potential for amazing things, and also for terrible things. And friendship, family, love are some great words. But you're a being as yourself, as one, your own. That truth is most of the times never the biggest, or the most important. But it's the most real. It's so real that you don't even think about it. It's something you were born with. And die with. But in the middle of that, in the middle of birth and death, in the middle of that truth...that's where the magic happens. And where the horror happens.


          I know who's been chasing me. It's nothing but my own self. The only horror that you can never end because that end would be the end of everything. I'm advising myself to stay away from myself, not away but not too close, like a heater you reached out with your hands, it feels so nice but you can burn yourself if you're too close. I've been trying to keep that balance since I had realized the truth. Knowing only reduces the fear.

Hey Guys I come to you with a special request today.

My best friend Johanne is currently struggling with depression and yesterday she had a very hard day. She was losing her will for life and got suicidal thoughts again. I was able to talk her out of it again so she’s safe again. I told her how happy I am she didn’t do anything bad.  And I told her that that she deserves all the thank in the world because she decided to keep fighting. But she said sadly nobody around her is happy about that except me.

So here’s my request for you to help her:
Please comment “Thank you Johanne” 
I will show her this post later to show more people than just me are happy she’s still alive. 
You’re more than welcome to add more to the comment to cheer her up or even add your own story so we can help each other. 
I’d be so thankful if you can help me out to help her out guys! ❤️

Does anyone else find the thought of everyday just so daunting and anxiety inducing? I feel like we’re all just existing until we die anyway so why the fuck am I putting myself through what feels like the worst hell of having to get up and go to a fucking job everyday. The consistency of everyday life is so overwhelming. Knowing that I have to do this everyday.

All I want to do at the moment is stay in bed when I’m not at work and the second my alarm goes off in the morning my body aches and my stomach is churning.

66,"I have been on Dexamfetamine for over a decade. I am now 27. 

I recently quit those meds on doctors order (to many side effects). 

While on them (got them for more energy) i could work 15 hours a week and do a bit of cleaning in the house. I also felt anxious about leaving the house alone because i fainted a lot before i became 21 (afterwards like once every 2 months, before weekly or daily). 

Now, a month without them i went for a walk and i felt so weird, i missed something. I think i missed my anxiety. 

Dont get me wrong, i felt fine, but being fine feels weird! 
I have this huge mental blockade to work through. That blockade is “but i am not on meds, i should be a mess”. 

I feel that blockade every time i go out alone, but once i am outside i feel okay. 

I guess i just have to convince myself that everything is fine and keep pushing my “limits” that i gave myself. Like, yes you can go to the store alone (has been a while) and yes go through that street even though there are people (still working on that one).

Oh and my energylevel? I still work 15 hours a week, but yesterday i also baked bread and cleaned out the scullery and took out the glass (few streets from here) still felt i could have done more. 

Kinda mad at the doctor for not checking up on me to see if the meds were working... sounds like they worked counter productive for years now. 

Thanks for reading, i just had to get this out. I give myself until the first of march (3 months off meds) to really feel the difference before i will complain to the doctor. He is mot even the one who prescribed them in the first place. Dunno the name of the shrink that did.",23Jan2020,1

I'm not depressed: I enjoy so many things, but when that thing starts to reach out of my comfort zone I stop and instead watch youtube videos or something. I hate that I always do this because I'm not getting anything done in life. I hate cleaning and studying and everything because it requires effort, and I hate admitting this because it makes me feel like the worst slob.

I hear voices most of the time, and have gotten used to it. I have a doctor, but I just say what I need to say in order to get what I want. I’m being a complete asshole to everyone who really cares about me because they’re limiting me by trying to protect me from myself.

76,"I got referred to a psychiatrist from my doctor a few months ago.
The psychiatrist and I had an initial appointment where she talked to me for an hour and determined a few possible diagnoses.
We checked in every two or three weeks and I did a screening tool for ptsd and ADD. I was ""diagnosed"" with depression and put on a medication. We never touched on any of the diagnoses from the screening tools and I'd sit in her office for five minutes while she would go, ""hows your mood? hows your sleep? Are you suicidal? Okay see you in three weeks"".

I started zoloft during christmas and was on it for three weeks. In this program you don't get in touch with the psychiatrist directly, they have a nurse you're suppose to call. I missed the call from the nurse to schedule a follow up appointment with the zoloft. I called her for a week and a half and left messages without any answer, then recieved a letter in the mail saying my file would be closed if I didn't call the nurse back.

After two weeks of calling she finally answered and asked me if I got the letter, then reluctantly set up an appointment. When I told the psychiatrist I quit the zoloft cold turkey because I was running out of my script, was experiencing very bad side effects and couldn't get ahold of the nurse, she offered me another med. 

I told her I couldn't keep experimenting with meds while being in school and working so I would try it in april. She said if we weren't going to be making any changes she was going to close my file and transfer my care to my family doctor. I told her multiple times during our visit that my family doctor is unable to make mental health diagnoses. 

I feel kind of lost, I was expecting a lot more out of these visits. I have had horrible mental health issues since I was 12 years old -- self harm, suicide attempts, mood swings and depressive episodes. I'm really upset that we got 1/4 of the way through any sort of screening processes so I'm sitting here without any guidelines or layouts to follow while I continue going through counselling. 

Is this common practise for psychiatrists?

77,"To start, before anyone says ""well clearly you have control because you're asking for help"" I'm able to type this because my dopamine-starved brain has figured out that reddit upvotes are the easiest way to get tiny drips of the delicious chemical that it craves, and this takes almost no effort, so it allows me to do these things because it's expecting gratification.

I don't control my actions anymore. To be specific, I don't consciously control my actions anymore, it's like my consciousness is sorta floating around somewhere near my body, and my body is controlled by a feral toddler. I can sometimes bait it into doing what I want, but if I let it know what I'm doing or how to get out of it, no dice. I get brief periods of control when I get serious adrenaline rushes but those are seldom on purpose. 

I'm diagnosed with ADHD, asperger's (now high-functioning autism), and gender dysphoria. There's probably something else unknown going on as well, in addition to all of this. I am physically being blocked from control of my body, if I want to do something my subconscious doesn't want to I have to put in immense mental effort and specifically, consciously, control each muscle individually until sometimes my subconscious decides to play along, but the mental effort involved is physically draining.

I don't want to do this anymore. I'm sitting here, crying internally as I watch my monkey brain run my life for me and ruin all my best laid plans. My conscious has so many things it wants to do and during brief moments of control I try to get the ball rolling but as soon as I lose it then it's hopeless. 

I've been rotting in retail for more than a year now, I hate it, but it's the only thing I can reliably do as my hyperactive body loves the runner's high that comes from it, and it only makes the gap between conscious and subconscious worse since I have 8 hours a day where I literally don't have to think about anything and can completely dissociate, it's been 15 months since I started and it feels like it's been less than 3. I've got projects I've barely started that I set in motion more than a year ago. 

I don't know what to do, therapy does nothing but push my conscious and subconscious EVEN FARTHER APART and make me feel EVEN MORE LIKE SHIT because not only do I have to sit back and watch myself ruin my life, I KNOW WHY I'M DOING IT AND WHY IT'S BAD and I can't do anything about it.",23Jan2020,1
78,"Since around 15 I’ve had strange mental things happen to me\[26M\]. 

For instance, I am no longer capable of having nightmares. An example of this is I was having a nightmare where a demon was attempting to kill me. In the end it switched up and I ended up having a relationship with this grudge like figure. Naturally I woke up confused but got on with it.  
 Another example is where I’ve been chased by something that is trying to kill me, I then enter a pause menu just as I am about to die and quit… then wake up. This happens regularly in any form of nightmare I have. 

Another thing to add to this is that I’m often faced with tasks that I cannot workout myself, but when I go to sleep, I dream about the resolution of my issue. This is around coding (sql and python). Suddenly I have the knowledge to resolve issues I spend around 7 days trying to resolve.

79,"Hi everyone

Just wanted to write a story about my life here, just to look back and realise how far Ive come.

I was born into a world of trauma and abuse, thankfully my caring mother picked up the broken pieces as my father abused me emotionally, physically, psychologically and sexually.

I didnt realize how much stress I was under until I reached the age of 22 when I had my 1st mental breakdown....I did however self medicate with drugs which amplified the effect...I was smoking cannibas daily all day as of it were tobacco.

I went to the hospital and I came back to normal within a week from my psychosis, experienced a short wave of depression after so I took 2 years out of college, shortly after I fell back into my drug habits and a year later I experienced yet another breakdown.

I was kept in hospital for 8 weeks and after I was releasd I was depressed for about a year. (Couch ridden watching the same movies over and over)

One day I had none of it anymore, I decided to take the last year before going back to college to focus on my studies in preparation for the next year of college, my mental health (therapy, mindfullness, quitting drugs).

I then went back to college and finished the last 3 years, each with a 1st class honours and now working as an engineer.

Currently trying keep a habit of gym and mindfullness, still going to therapy and I think I'll be doing that for the rest of my life.

Also im receiving once a month injections to keep my psychosis at bay.

81,"Can't believe I'm asking this question, or that I'm in this situation but I'd like to know what you all think. 

After a traumatic life event last year, a friend and coworker (that I've worked closely with for the last few years) really stepped up and offered emotional support.  This was surprising and unexpected, but it came at the perfect time. 

I didn't realize it then, but it sparked an unbelievable connection between us.  I say ""us"" because of how it feels when we are in the same room... Theres no way it's just one sided, but we haven't ever really talked about it.  Looking back I see that the energy that was created actually got me through the tough time. 


I am pretty sure I'm in love with this person. I say ""pretty sure"" because I've never been in love before, but I always thought being in love was something that grew over time, with physical connection. The emotions I have towards this person are so strong. I'm 35 if you were wondering.  Here's the bad part: this person is married. We haven't ever crossed any lines or had any physical contact ever, but it's all I can think about. I want everything with this person and it is very unlikely that I will be able to express it to them.  The idea of being separated from them (which is highly probable) physically hurts my body, which is ridiculous but also kind of blows my mind.

So my question is: what is this plague in my mind? Is this love? Do people really fall in love before any physical contact? Or is this just a strange symptom of my emotional duress from last year (like Stockholm syndrome or something lol)? More importantly what can I do to make it stop?",23Jan2020,1
82,"2 years ago I used to feel in control of myself, and time felt like it was the present. I would feel like I'm looking with my own eyes and things were real, but now it feels like I'm living in the past and there's a blur over my vision or something. sometimes it feels like I'm watching a TV screen or something. I know im in control of myself but it doesn't feel real. (no I'm not gonna kill anybody or something I'm sane lol)
when I'm looking out my window or standing on my porch nothing feels real it feels like I'm dreaming or something. I know I feel like this because sometimes I'll get the present feeling and everything will look/feel real, the blur would also be gone but it only stays like that for a couple seconds and happens randomly. 
 I've been living in my room for the past 3 or 4 years without any socializing and i leave the house maybe once or twice a month (sometimes none) so I was think that's why i feel this way but I'm not sure.
Does everyone feel like this and I just haven't gotten used to it? Will I ever feel like things are real and I'm living in the present again?

1. Supposedly, yesterday I told him to do the job he asked me, like I was angry against him but I don't even remember to have feel negative emotions and saying something like that.
2. He feels some tension and anxiety in me, that I am always anxious, worried, not sure about some things.

But the scariest part... in all that...is that I don't remember at all. So I apologized and told him that I don't even remember all those things. So I don't know what to do... Am I crazy? Or is he crazy? Should I consult? Should I see my doctor and ask for sick leaves cause i'm becoming crazy?

Also, some days before, I had a mental breakdown while I was waiting for the bus and my boyfriend was with me, so he asked me what is wrong and it was just...a mix of a lot of things, like I was feeling incapable to do my job, alone, lost, without friends, scared that he leaves me.

92,"Feeling unwanted and useless. 

Your confidence deplenishes, and it slowly begins to eat away at you. First you just feel shitty, like you have let someone down or have made a mistake. 

When that surpasses (even if it does surpass) the anxiety takes over. You start asking yourself, ‘are those people judging me?’ and ‘i bet they hate me’. You feel so much self hatred and you end up giving up simple social tasks to avoid embarrassment, but that often leads to more embarrassment as people begin to think you are strange and that you dont want social interaction, when deep down thats all you want, you want that recognition. Just a shred of it. It got to a point where i started hanging around people who didn’t truly enjoy my company (I was 14) and i pretended to be happy, to be contempt with my life and to be like them. I wasn’t, they were pricks (except for one guy). I felt so ugly and shitty that at one point a single compliment from another girl my age made my week, like it was great. 

Then, when you fight against that and take risks to surpass your anxiety, you start to do more things socially. For me, it was taking MDMA last summer, it opened my eyes and allowed me to understand that people dont really hate me. 

Im terrified its going to come back, that im going to do something that kicks off a domino effect which dooms me to a life of self resentment and a lack of confidence. It scares me more than any horror movie, any relationship or exam date. Because i think that it is truly the be all and end all. I thought that it is the whole purpose of life, and that if people dont like me and enjoy my company then whats the point.

Luckily, i found a group if friends that actually care and they genuinely enjoy my company. I feel apart of something again.

The worst part about the whole thing is that the one thing you want is to be normal, popular even, and you would do anything for that. In these efforts, you only push people away and then you start to hate yourself for it. If you dont tell someone, it WILL get worse, trust me. Its a form of depression which eats you up without even noticing it. I never felt sad or upset for large periods of time, as that is only one symptom of depression. Instead, i just felt tired, drained. I gave up at one point. Ive never been suicidal or anything as i value life to much to ever harm myself, but i can easily see how someone could slip into such a destructive state. 

Im 16 now, and the worst bit it that i was focusing so much on acting mature when i was younger, that i alienated myself from the TRUE reason of childhood.

I regret not giving a fuck, i regret not stepping outside my comfort zone and i regret not focusing on the things that matter, and now i have that to deal with.  I think the worst bit is that in my much improved and happier state, i still feel brief of what i once was. I still sometimes feel anxiety, and sadness but instead of suppressing it ive learnt to deal with it. Before hand, i would just hide it by acting overly careless and happy, even if i wasn’t.

97,"To give you all some background context; I’m a 24 year old male from the UK (London). I left my last job due to being in a toxic environment which made my work life miserable. I started my new role just over 3 months ago and the work and people make this such a fantastic opportunity! Unfortunately I was hit by some health news last month and I’m starting to feel the knock on effect on my mental health.

This isn’t new to me. I have an eating disorder of nearly 11 years and have already once come close to taking my own life. I suffer from depression, anxiety and would say I eat and drink my feelings away.

I saw a therapist for a few months last year and we worked from some issues - 1 main was being emotionally/sexually abused as a child/teen for which I decided to report one person to the police. I found out in January they won’t be pursuing the investigation and that it would probably never have gone to trial even though I had evidence, a name, and even an address. 

Recently I’ve been diagnosed with pre diabetes and an under active thyroid as well as being told my drinking has damaged my liver over the years. I’m on medication and have started to go to a PT to help lose weight but of course my main issue of an eating disorder has me gripped by fear and is completely controlling my life.

It’s like I’m waiting for a valid reason to end my life. And yet I have so many issues. I don’t know how to keep working and seek help. My new job is very busy which I love! But when I have a bad day like today I can only spend the hours in bed contemplating how it will all come to an end.

I have friends who know I struggle but at the end of the day it’s not their problem. My family only add to my stress and I realise a lot of my eating disorder comes from an unhappy upbringing and a way to control my life. 

“It’s said just before you die your life flashes before your eyes.

99,"I've basically dealt with this feeling my entire life, but it's starting to impact me more as life get's busier and my friends do as well. I'm looking for advice with how to deal with this. 

Essentially whenever I have some time where I have a scheduled meet up with friends I enjoy the hell out of it, but the next day I'll get depressed that it's over. Usually, if I can look forward to something else, that eases it or distracts me enough that it won't bother it, but there are situations that also exacerbate it. Here's an example:  


&gt;Two nights ago I had some people over to play a new board game that I got and it was a blast. The game has a continuing story element to it so I'm looking forward to playing it with them again, but when I tried to schedule our next time to get together, a lot of people were busy and it's likely that the group won't be able to meet that day.   


This should be no big deal right? Just look a few more weeks out and figure out what works, but that's not what my brain and emotions hear. They hear, ""well that's not happening. What you wanted isn't going to work, and you aren't going to get to experience that fun again when you thought you would.""  


I think there are a bunch of reasons this happens. My expectations were unrealistic, an issue of self-esteem that people want to hang out and play this game, a fear of missing out on an opportunity for friends to get together, but regardless of the fact that I recognize all of this and know it, I can't seem to get my emotional self to reconcile with it. 

Do you have strategies you recommend in dealing with these kinds of emotions and feelings? A way to reconcile what you know and what you feel, to then feel ok with a result that you aren't happy with? Any suggestions would be helpful.   


TL;DR: I guess the TLDR is, how to deal with disappointment when what causes the disappointment is rational, but you can't get your emotions in line with your rational understanding.",23Jan2020,1

101,"So lately my partner has been in a really tough spot and simply put, his depression got worse to the point of him contemplating suicide. 

He has had moments before where he's thought about it, researched it, or even gotten the materials together and sat with them. He once even wrote a suicide letter (mostly over the expanse of years, though more frequently lately). I've managed to be there for him every time in the last few months. 

Last Saturday he went really down and I was at work, he sat down and he took some pills, and was about to take more but (thankfully) called his best friend and was stopped. Took him to hospital and everything is ""fine"" now. He's not got lasting issues or anything, just depressed and kinda suicidal at times still. 

Anyway, to my point. Before he took the pills that day, he had his son (3) over to stay, but he called up the little ones mum to pick him up. He said that he was going to do something bad and this was the last time little one would see dad again. He was upset over this but left with his mum and told her in the car what dad had said, she didn't really believe him. Plus they'd just had a disagreement while she picked little one up. 

As far as I know, no one really told little one much more. Little one was very affectionate and clingy when he came around next, he did know something was up and he tends to be able to feel when his dad is down, and this was just an extreme moment. 

Tonight (about 30 minutes ago) they're laying in bed about to go to sleep and decide to eat some chips first, so I get up to get dad a drink and little one says to me what we both think we heard as ""are you going to kill yourself now?"" 
I actually felt sick and was immediately like ""what did you say?"" Though not harshly. He responded with ""nothing"" nd further prompting resulting in the same answer.

114,"I've always generally felt close to her until she got into a relationship with her current boyfriend . He seems really sweet and I'm happy for her because in the past shes had difficult experiences with love but I can't help but feel that I've been dropped at the side for him and I feel like our friendship is just drifting further and further apart with every passing day. About two years ago we went to a concert together and that was a really lovely experience as it was the first time we both got to see one of our favourite bands perform live. She said she might be able to see me this weekend but honestly on a practical sense , I feel like if I ask her if she still would like to meet up she'll most likely be busy with something else . I am quite an emotional person but I feel like most people would feel like this if they felt like one of their closest friendships was potentially being taken away from them.

My Theory of the ""god-Me""

The ultimate point I can't possibly disprove: I am an immortal being that has always existed through reincarnation. 

Conclusion: I am actually this immortal being, or I'm not,  which means I need psychiatric help and probably medication.

Set-up to how I came to this conclusion: I have been having anxiety attacks lately.  I have a psychiatrist appointment for anxiety medicine,  but the first available date is March 10th. I've had 4 attacks in the last week and a half with one being extremely bad. To deal with the stress until I can get medicine, I bought some weed yesterday (legal where I live and bought from a store). I had this thought last night while high before bed. Why am I scared? Because I've been to sleep and it's 12 hours later and I'm still going over this theory. I'm scared it wasn't me being high. 

The theory:

I am an immortal being that continues to exist physically through reincarnation. There is also a spiritual being that created all this and that is also me.  Think of it as like the base of Christianity just instead of God/Jesus having already came,  It is me and it is happening right now. This spiritual being will be referred to as the ""god-me"" from here on out. The god-me is all-knowing and all powerful. In order to reach the state of being of the god-me,  god-me realized that I needed to learn things.  So I created physical existence and placed myself in it.  This is the physical me typing this right now.  In order to actually learn things needed to later become the god-me,  god-me had to remove the all-knowing part of itself when it placed the physical existence. This is why I am not all knowing right now. Everyone and everything else that is not me was created by god-me as tools to help me to continue learning the things I need to learn so I become god-me. This includes you reading this right now. Every person I meet and interact with's only purpose it to be apart of a lesson for physical me.

god-me is so powerful in it's state of being,  that in order to reach this state it had to create existence.  It also realize that the path to being god-me will take such a long time that it injected itself into physical existence and made reincarnation. It will take eons of physical lifetimes to properly learn everything. This… reincarnation. Here's where the scary thoughts are happening.  There is no consequences to me dying because I will be reborn into the next lifetime to continue learning.  Every choice I make,  every right decision and wrong decision,  everything good and bad is something the physical me needs to learn to become god-me.  god-me realized this and that's why it created everything. I could kill myself and it's OK.  Past lifetimes may have done that.  Future lifetimes may do that.  My current lifetime doesn't want to kill myself, but I am now aware of this opportunity. I am an immortal being.

The best way I can think to explain it is like a reverse Truman Show.  Just instead of be being Truman and not in on it,  everyone else in existence is Truman. You were created by god-me so I can become god-me. This is my Theory. 

or…..

the other option is I am wrong about everything. My brain came up with this theory that I have no possible way of disproving. So,  it some sense,I believe this.  If I'm wrong, I need mental health. Or to continue the loop of god-me,  god-me knew I needed to learn this and it's just another lesson for me to learn. If I am wrong about god-me,  I am scared right now at the steps my brain is taking to rationalize my existence.  If I am god-me everything will be OK. 

I don't know what is the answer and I'm scared right now. Is this the beginning is a psychotic breakdown?

One thing that I can't get over is this is just a theory that I came up with whole high and means nothing.  But I'm not high right now. And again,  if I came up with this theory (even when high) my brain must believe some part of it.  Or I'm seriously not mentally well.",23Jan2020,1
118,"Hello, mom of 3, raising them alone for the majority of the time, I'm 23.
The last 3 days Ive been feeling off, and then boom, last night like a tone of bricks I just couldnt keep coping, I went into a very deep depressive episode, I can't eat, sleep, stay awake during the day, I have laundry to do and no motivation to do it. 
I'm so tired. 
But I remembered my husband said during our seperation he'd still be there for me when I need him, so naturally, I reach out telling him I'm struggling and he leaves me on read. No its not a he just got it situation, because he read it 6 hours ago or more, and if it was his best friend going threw this, he'd blow me off, and he has done that and understood, I didnt argue, I wasnt rude. But with me, its like the sadder I get, the deeper I fall dude just doesnt seem to give a shit. I have other friends but one only talks aboht her issues whenever I bring up mine, the other is always busy doing who knows what, one is in a different time zone, and the other says he cares about me so much, but hes either busy or ignoring me, cause we start a conversation and then hes just gone for hours. My mom tries but shes got other stuff going on, so shes at the hospital with her dad (my estranged grandpa) making medical decisions for him. I'm just started to feel really alone and my kids being bratty is really getting to me. I cant take it anymore and I cant even get into seeing my regular therapist. I dont even know where to turn. I am diagnosed ptsd, depression, severe anxiety and I struggle with phone call anxiety. I havent been sleeping, and thats a major reason I think its so bad.",23Jan2020,1

My dad kept dragging me into a room by my hair I think it was just a handmade room that my mom and dad designed for me my dad and my mom would do it in front of me.

They did this when I was younger at my grandparents house. I fucking hate my mom, I used to say I love my mom but I can stand her but I can't say that anymore because it's not true anymore. Honestly I don't think it was true in the first place. Anytime my parents have sex I freak out.
I hit myself, I scratch myself and I yell and throw things.

I want to get rid of this. I'm on the verge of taking myself off my meds that I take night and day. I know I will relapse but I honestly don't care. I put myself in risky situations without any regard for my safety. I need help or a diagnosis maybe some tips of how to get rid of the constant memories I have about my parents doing it. My mom won't take me to PTSD therapy because she doesn't believe me. Last week I've had severe anxiety attacks.

My friend thinks I might have schizophrenia and I'm going to get it checked out for his benefit. I don't believe I have it

The main reason for this is because due to my depression over the years I have essentially created an imaginary friend for myself. He is known as the doctor and is essentially the grim reaper in the guise of a plague doctor
I have slight doubts that he's real, but I know that it's all in my head
I have never had hallucinations of the doctor, this is focusing on the delusion aspect of schizophrenia
When I'm down and suicidal, I draw the doctor, I drink and will often have conversations with a mask that I own, even knowing he isn't real. It's just a comfort thing

127,"So 2/3 years ago I started Uni. At the same time I just got through the 12 month waiting list for my acne medication (accutane).

As a kid, I've always been so insecure about my self because of my weight and my acne and my voice.

Anyway. I started taking it and it messed with me mentally which was mentioned to me in the meeting about the medication and I was given ever 3 months a checkup and a blood test for it

During this I felt so depressed and lonely that I opened up to a close friend and because of that became even closer. She was my best friend and we talked and did a lot of things together. We opened up to each other about our self's and our secrets. We both got emotional and the more we spoke the closer we got.

One day I stupidly told her I liked her, ever since then it's not need the same. We've argued and fought over stupid things and then made up over it. I cared about her and she cared about me. But it went on for so long.

The last time we argued, she unblocked me and told me she missed me and that she cared for me. She just broke up with her boyfriend and she felt alone. Ever since we spoke and hugged it out. It felt like it went back to the way it was but then she got back with him. I asked her if we could speak because the guy is controling and manipulative. She said we could speak and we never did. So I blocked her. Couple of days later. I unblocked her because I knew I was in the wrong and she went all out on me, said we were fine, there was nothing wrong and then I blocked her out the blue. She blocked me so many times before and this was the second time I blocked her. We argued for a while until she started ignoring me. I tried once or twice a couple of months later and still she said she didn't want to be friends because we argue all the time. She then later got cheated on by her boyfriend twice and I felt so bad. 2 weeks went by I dropped her a message if she wanted to speak about it and I heard what happened. She said she was thankful and there was no need. I tried to rekindle the friendship but she just ignored me.

During all this, one of my mates started treating my like shit. So I stopped speaking to him. Then in a group chat about 5 friends turned against me. I lost all them.

From starting this medication to now. I've failed my first year of uni twice and I'm on my last chance now and I feel so depressed and lonely than ever. I don't speak to anyone at uni and hardly speak to anyone from my school when I left

I have 2 friends right now that I trust. The rest, I feel just use me. I have anxiety and depression. I've gained weight and im getting heavier everyday. I do nothing with my life and I see no point in continuing it. I get suicidal thoughts every few days or so and wish I was dead but I can't carry through with suicide and probably will never will do that. I still think about that girl. It's been months but she was the one that checked up on me and made me feel happier about life, but now I've lost her and I don't know what to do. I know she's lost herself with that boy friend but nothing I can do.

Names changed for privacy.

My friend, Laura, just asked me for some advice regarding her daughter, Kayla. Kayla is in HS but I'm unsure of her exact age .. somewhere between 14 and 16. I believe she has private insurance. 

Laura told me that Kayla confided in her about how voices/thoughts (I don't remember exactly) in her head want her (Kayla) to hurt her boyfriend and little sisters (one is 4) and that these voices/thoughts are scaring her. She hasn't acted on them. Random but may help: her grades aren't slipping; in fact she recently did well (for her) on a test (midterm?) in her weakest subject. 

But those were the only symptoms, etc. Laura and I discussed that I can remember. I am happy that Kayla reached out to her mother about this. I told Laura I'd try to get some information, etc. so Kayla can start getting the help she may need NOW instead of waiting for something possibly tragic to occur. Thanks for your patience, time, and advice!! Greatly appreciated. 😁

130,"Right now I have a worst case scenario internet addiction that is worsened by Adderall abuse. I have already made the switch to a non stimulant medication but I refilled my Adderall right before I did so right now I'm continuing to abuse the Adderall I have remaining just because it continues to give me the most short term emotional relief I can find.

I want to be an artist but ive been practicing as seriously as I can for five years and have learned so little. I have honestly been fired from so many jobs and have failed so many self started projects and goals that I really am convinced that I am capable of nothing good and this is due to my unstable emotions and cognitive deficits. I don't do anything well and am constantly experiencing high levels of anxiety and depression on a constant basis. I am constantly restless and never feel on the same page as anybody who talks to me.

I have tried most medication options and combinations you could reasonably try for anxiety, depression, and ADHD after 7 years of aggressively trying everything there is to take often multiple times. The only antidepressant type I haven't tried is Trintellix since it is newer but what hope do I have of that making a difference when nothing else really has? Plus now I'm being consistently told now across most of these type of posts I make (by different people in different subreddits) that pretty much I can't expect medication to change things as much as I hoped it could. Well if that's true then how can I ever expect anything to get better when I am so bad at social skills and disorganized and irrational that talk therapy doesn't help me at all? 

I am 26 years old but the past 15 years of my life have been so unnecessarily unbearable that I don't know how my life can ever improve. My mind constantly wanders to places that disturb me and often doesn't make any sense and always comes up with bad ideas that my internet addiction and Adderall abuse  is the only way I know how to cope with how my mind works. 

I start IOP tomorrow but I've already tried it 3 times and each time was so boring and didn't help anything that how can I even be optimistic about it helping the 4th time I try it? I can't really understand or be on the same page with other people when they talk anyways.

131,"So I have BPD and a few months ago I suffered a VERY traumatic event caused by an overdose on drugs, it shaped my life for the worst, I was suicidal and really wanted to kill myself because the experience of it was too much for me.

My boyfriend is an avid user he used to smoke weed every single day in large quantities, don’t get me wrong I didn’t have a problem with that until after the event. For a while I was contemplating if I could stay with him because I just couldn’t see myself being with someone whose happiness only came from drugs (he himself admitted that). My psychiatrist even said I should stay away from anything drug related because it is a huge trigger for me. 

Thankfully we got over it and I tried helping him as much as possible to stop his weed smoking because it was starting to affect his life and also mine, he smokes much less now but still uses other drugs to feel happy. 

I don’t have a problem with drugs, but the event really traumatized me and I just can’t get over how much it triggers me when he does this, I haven’t told him because I just don’t want to disappoint him, he’s come so far and I’m so proud of him.

Backstory: My doctors say I most likely don't have it but they've been wrong about a number of things before. They told me 'you aren't impulsive and that's one of the three things of ADD' (no, that's adhd, it's one of the things that makes it different from Add) and 'you get good grades and usually people with ADD don't do well in school' (I study 7 hours a day all through the semester and my friend with ADD only started a few days before the exams and still got a 6) and yeah. I don't really trust them. It's like they have no idea what they're talking about.

Anyway.
I used to do fastfood as a side job. Awful. Everything went too fast and it was like I was never thinking clearly.
Sure I get distracted by some things, but this wasn't really being distracted by something, it was just not making sense what I did. Like I would think 'ok I should do this this way' and then someone would be like 'the hell are you doing so difficult for, just do it like this'. 
And now at work too (another job). I do things that don't make sense, I don't think, when people need help I'll see it, be like... wait do they need help? Maybe I should- and then it's already over. I just feel so dense and I'm kind of hoping that it turns out I have ADD because maybe that would explain all my dumb actions.
Because I'm not dumb, I get good grades.

141,"First off, I’d like to put a disclaimer that this post is not to incite or invite negativity toward Christianity, God, or his church at large. This is just my story and a reflection of human relationships and how they can affect our mental health. Please follow the rules of the sub and be supportive of others and respectful of their beliefs.

I started working for my church in 2018 as a 19yo worship intern. It was my job 40 hours a week to work under the worship pastor (let’s call him John), creating music sets, leading musical ensembles, and managing volunteers, among other things. This was my first full time job outside of my dad’s construction company and a very different environment. John led me to believe that I had a higher calling to become a worship pastor. I had been playing music in the church since I was little and understood it well, so it made enough sense to me.

The first few months of work went well enough, I enjoyed the job. However, as time went on I started to lack a sense of encouragement or any real direction from John. John was wildly overworked at the time. The lead pastor (who we’ll call Rick) had John working easily 80 hours a week, resulting in me seeing him very infrequently. I had no set schedule and there were weeks where I truly had no clue what to do. When I led the music services, Rick would rarely say a thing, and John mostly just had “constructive” criticism for me, most compliments were surfacey formalities, true compliments were few and far between. I recall one Sunday, John’s only note for me was that my guitar was smudged and needed cleaned. I received many notes on my pitchy vocals, so I took 3 months of vocal lessons to no avail. I felt no good, that my work was never good enough, like I was stealing paychecks from my church that I loved so much. The work I started doing for God and my “higher calling for ministry” now started to feel like handcuffs. Depression and anxiety sank in more by the day. I took solace in some of the songs that I sang for the services. I sang a hand full of them frequently, finding comfort in the words and melodies, but eventually they said I sang them too frequently and needed them to be cut. Other songs because the congregation didn’t worship enough to them. I started taking medication to remedy how I felt, but it only made me sink further. Intrusive thoughts about taking my life started to surface. I knew this wasn’t me, and I knew something had to be done. So after a year and a half, I quit my job with a smile on my face, went back to working for my dad’s company; things have never been better. No medication and freedom from the depression and anxiety I felt.

Everyone expects so much of me and it’s starting to drain me.  Whenever I bring this up I get told that at least I’m not failing. It seems as though because some people have it worse than me I’m not allowed to be upset about the ridiculous expectations I’m being held to.

Whenever someone scores higher than me they treat it like it’s the best thing ever to happen. I’m happy for them but still all I got is I can’t believe Person A beat you.

I feel so meh all the time now. Any time I get an A I get downplayed by being told well that was expected of you and anytime I get a B or lower I get told that they can’t believe I didn’t get an A.

I just needed somewhere to rant. Thanks.",23Jan2020,1

154,"TW: Suicidal thoughts 

A couple hours ago, I was feeling like life isn't worth living anymore. I was having a lot of thoughts about just ending everything. I've struggled with mental illness for a long time now. I got in an argument with my boyfriend but I told him how I feel every day. He then told me to go outside and take as long as I need. I used to go outside a lot when it was warmer out and I realized I haven't really spent any time outdoors since winter started. I just didn't see the point. But today, I needed it. I needed it so bad. Feeling the coldness of the air and watching the snow fall down brought me some kind of peace I haven't felt in awhile and brought me back to thinking somewhat more clearly. I didnt know how much it would really help. Im going to try to go outside at least once a day. I don't know if this could help other people but I just felt I should share how it helped me.",23Jan2020,1
155,"So, I’ll start at the beginning. I (F18) always been a shy, insecure person as long as I can remember. As a child I always felt lesser than my peers because I felt I was bigger and not as pretty. I was the tallest in my class, even taller than all the boys and I hated it. I distinctly remember being 10 and doing laps around my garden to lose weight as I wanted to be like the other girls my age. Looking back at photos from that time it’s clear that I had a distorted body image because I looked like a literal stick insect. I never really had food problems at that stage but I definitely was much more concerned about my body image that a child should be at that stage. 
From then, I’ve always had a bit of a fixation with healthy eating and I was always conscious about it, never using the vending machine in school like all my friends and feeling shame when eating unhealthy foods.
Then when I was 14, I was going on a ski trip with my school where we had to put our weight and height on a form to get the right skis. At this stage I had filled out a good bit and I was no longer stick thin, but I most certainly wasn’t over weight. When I went to put my form in the box, I was 68kg, I saw another girls form that said 54kg and that was when I really decided I needed to take proper action and I began to starve myself. It didn’t last long, my family have always been big eaters and it was impossible to skip dinner and breakfast so all I could do was skip lunch and exercise for hours every day. I barely lost any weight and quickly went back to eating healthily for the most part, but my image and my excess weight was always on my mind.
On and off from then until now I would go through these periods of restricting and doing excess cardio because I hated my body and myself and I thought that losing weight would magically fix everything in my life. As I got older age 15/16 I gained weight and I neared but didn’t reach the overweight bmi category. I really really felt insecure and I avoided social events, wouldn’t wear shorts or T-shirt’s showing my legs and arms due to past times when my brother would make fun off me for gaining weight and call me “flobby”.  

I had never told anyone of my struggles with weight and eating until I met a boy who I had an instant connection with and really felt I could trust. I told him everything and soon after, we started dating. That was in May 2018, and when I went on holiday in July it was the first time I could remember feeling better (not perfect but better) about wearing swim gear in front of people. Before this I would always wear a T-shirt and shorts in the sea/pool and I would never exercise in front of anyone Incase I looked like a red fat spluttering pig.

So, since then with his support and since I joined an amazing crossfit gym where I’ve learned to enjoy exercise rather than fear it and use it as punishment, I’ve been generally much better with bad patches here and there but with someone to talk to it’s become much more manageable. Until three months ago. 

I went through my first scary experience with this whole thing. I really really hated myself due to exam stress and just feeling a bit worthless and ofc my weight as Ive had to give up crossfit due to being in a major exam year and not having time. I began to restrict scarily low, not eating breakfast or lunch, and throwing up my dinner every day. This lasted for a week before I broke down and told my boyfriend who made me tell my parents as he thought I needed help. 
I had lost 9 lbs (went from 148-139) that week. 

I told my parents that I think I should see a counsellor but they didn’t think that would help as they don’t believe in counsellors and I have done well in ignoring food and weight (to an extent) from then until now. I had gained back some of the weight from that time , back up to 143, but over Christmas I gained another two pounds and I began to feel disgusting and out of control. I began restricting and purging again this week and seeing the same results I’ve been seeing. However , I know that if I continue the way I’m going and my parents find out they won’t let me go to college next year as they’re afraid I won’t eat and I’ll waste away to nothing. 

So 

My question is 

How can I get help with this? I’m not underweight, and my periods of restricting and purging are on and off, but I’m really scared that this will escalate and I really really don’t want to live like this anymore.",23Jan2020,1
156,"I lost a friendship that meant dear to me a few months ago after months of an ugly fallout.

It was a really bad time. I spent the time during and after unpacking it in therapy. It rocked a lot of different parts of my life for a lot of reasons I'm still trying to figure out.

I finally reached a point this winter where I felt like myself again, and even better. I got over my social anxiety and fear of intimacy and started connecting with people better than I have in a long time. It felt great, and I didn't miss my friend anymore.

But this past week I've been missing them like crazy, so when I talked about it in therapy we uncovered that that relationship was satisfying an emotional need stemming from childhood trauma that I'd avoided talking about until now, and in order to figure out what it is I need, we have to get into it.

So, I'm finally ready to unpack my ugly past for some reprocessing, but I already feel myself becoming fragile and anxious more often. Like, if a friend responds to me in a way that isn't 100% enthusiastic, suddenly I worry they're mad at me or don't want to be my friend anymore. It kind of makes me want to isolate myself, get high or drink, but I don't want to do any of those things while going through such a fraught time.

So I got ‘discharged’ from his clinic and went on with life. 

Now I’m wishing that I had said something because I’m doing A levels and so many times we get told of how we need to be doing so much more study outside of school and I just can’t do it I can’t focus on any of it and I’ve kinda reached the point of panic because I’m scared I’m gonna fail but that fear also isn’t doing anything to get me to study so I really don’t know what to do.

158,"Hey everyone, this is my first time posting, I think anywhere.

I have a dear friend of mine who over the course of the last month has been developing what I consider a crazy delusion and I’m wondering if anyone could help me either suggest help for him or anything really. 

It started a month ago when he told me he was being contacted by an alien and the medium of communication was through drawing (he a professional artist) and he started drawing these crazy pictures that he claimed explained how to use some sort of subtle technology. After this, he started sending me videos of him “controlling” reality: in one he claims to control the hands of a clock, in which I responded, show me that same trick with four different clocks and he didn’t respond to that. Second he sent me a video of what he called “exploding bombs in the sky,” in which he faces his phone camera towards his face and behind him it looks like a bright light shines behind him. To me it looked like the camera adjusting for a change in light, but he claims he caused this. He also seems to have “discovered” a drawing technique that allows him to remote view in which he could see another friend of ours doing something, when I saw the drawing it looked like scribbles, our other friend was convinced it was real. Now he’s reading the Tibetan book of the dead and claiming he’s being communicated with and that he feels he’s supposed to write a new translation and that he worries all the communication is related to the end of the world. When I talk to him he seems totally rational and I asked him to see a therapist to get a reality check but I think he’s enjoy this episode too much. I don’t think he’ll harm himself or others at this point. 

So like, what the hell do I do? Any help is much appreciated.",23Jan2020,1

But after about a day of social contact that only comes from obligatory relationships (coworkers, family, people out and about) it starts to become very easy to focus on my faults and think hard about why people wouldn't want to be around me. After two or three days everything starts to seem disingenuous and I second guess everything. 

Some backstory: 

I've never been a social butterfly. I grew up 30-40 minutes from any friends I had from school so the only times I'd hang out with them was during birthdays. I was very involved in extracurricular activities, but any social bonds I made ended as soon as those activities did. Looking back now, I realize that a lot of my adult life (having the ability to choose who to be around and when) has been clinging to the few who make me a constant in their lives. I think this is an effort to make up for the lack of lasting attachments. 

Fast forward to now and I'm 23 and in the midst of a divorce from a person that took advantage of my desperation to not be lonely. Now I'm back at square one, but I can at least identify what my issue is. I just have no clue how to solve it. I desperately want to be able to feel confident that my social ties now aren't fabricated when I'm alone.

So, I have quit University about three years ago and I'm afraid that I won't ever be ready to start it again.

A bit of a background; When I started University about 4 or so years ago, it was okay at first but after some time I started to get severe anxiety in the classroom and I couldn't handle it, leading me to get out of the classroom every like 10 minutes or so just so I can calm down. And later on I started skipping classes or just avoiding going to University. I don't know what led to this. I don't have any anxiety about meeting people or anything like that. It just happened and I can't do anything about it.

I also feel this anxious and uncomfortable when I'm out in a cafe or something like that, but to a lesser extent. Leading me to go home early, and getting some small relief. Could it be some sort of comfort zone thing?

I've been separated from my husband for two months now. He began a new, high-stress job at the end of September and around the same time, his grandmother (who basically raised him while his mother worked) became very ill. It's at this time that I noticed a personality change in him. Fast forward to the beginning of November--we had a fight--I'm still not sure about what--that ended in him wanting a divorce. I was totally blindsided. We were having intimacy issues (I chalked that up to stress), but otherwise, had a good marriage. Spent lots of time together, talked all the time, ate dinner together every night, went on trips together, he took me out of town for my birthday a few days earlier, wrote ""I love you!"" on my birthday card, etc. During this fight he told me that he never loved me, always knew our marriage would fail, and only did nice things for me to convince himself that he loved me. 

Since our separation--which was entirely his choice--he's essentially been gaslighting me, according to my therapist. Basically making me feel like I'm an abusive monster who doesn't deserve love or sex. I've also caught him in lies (e.g. he told me that our marriage counselor told him that his and my relationship is the ""most f\*\*ked up she's ever seen."" Turns out she said nothing of the sort and was horrified that he'd tell me that). There's much more, but hopefully, that provides some context. I truly don't know where this is coming from. I'm definitely not perfect, but therapy has taught me not to buy into his perception of me. 

I'm very concerned about his mental health. This is not the kind, supportive, fantastic man I married. I feel like he's an entirely different person. Not only do I feel this way, but his family, my family, and our friends feel this way, too. It's like everyone else sees there's something wrong except for him. His family has been trying to get him to see a mental health professional, but he's very reluctant. Currently, he refuses to see me because ""our situation is difficult,"" I'm ""so much a part of his pain,"" he's ""doing everything he can to keep it together,"" etc. He also refuses to talk about our situation with me in any capacity, which really hurts me. All of this really hurts me.

I guess I'm wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar? I just feel so lost and am in so much pain. I love him so much and just want to make things better for everyone. I feel like I'm living in a nightmare...",23Jan2020,1
