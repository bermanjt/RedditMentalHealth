0,"I (M/17) have been experiencing depression, sudden change of friends followed by social withdrawal, neglect of hygiene, increased sensitivity to light, illusions and strong delusions (thinking that some family members will lure me into a forest to kill me or that they hired hitmen to take me down, always feeling watched, feeling that there are cameras hidden everywere). Also my visuals get really weird and frightening: Shadows begin to move slightly, objects veeery slightly moving, wall ""breathing"" in a subtle way, weird light tracers and bugs (mostly in peripheral vision). Also bigger objects like a closet gets really dark and appears to be a shadow entity that's sometimes wiggling around which is freaking me out tbh. Also there is this constant pinging noise in my ears and when I lay down in the dark I seem to hear distorted and very distant whispering voices or other unsettling noises, which are barely noticeable. Also my speech and writings are weird and unorganised, I sometimes forget what I was talking about before and stop speaking in the middle of a sentence without any apparent reason??
I feel VERY uncomfortable lying in the dark and ""hearing"" (only subtle, but still..) undistinct sounds that sound like whispering voices...my sleep pattern is also garbage, I only sleep like 4 hours and I don't even set an alarm clock. Frequent wakening and nightmares have been haunting me for several months, as the rest of the symptoms as well. I feel like the onset of schizophrenia starts to kick in, but there is no diagnosis, but if you don't hallucinate clearly you can't be diagnosed with this, that's the problem. What should I do??",04May2020,1
1,"if this matters at all i am a maladaptive day dreamer 

my inner voice is just ongoing and never shuts up, especially with watching something im actually interested in. I still know whats going on and tet the story and everything, but still id like to be able to focus on it without my head talking.

dont know if this is common but it sucks alot. It often gives me a sort of headache from me trying to shut the thoughts up, which i guess ill call intrusive, and just have there be nothing said about anything up there while im watching. When i think back to me watching it i never remember the thoughts in the memory, just what happened on the show. 

Hope this makes sense to someone. Ive found that actually talking about something stupid that happens can make me feel dumb for having it going on, so maybe this will help.",04May2020,1
2,"I'm not the best poet, or writer for that matter, I do these things just for me personally usually but I thought it could be relatable for some and after years and years of heavily 'self medicating’ with weed I finally made the step and received a diagnosis and began prescribed medication. Even just the diagnosis has improved my mental state dramatically, so I'm feeling very hopeful right now.

Anyway, here it goes:

I don't want to be stoned
I want to be happy

I don't want to be stoned
I don't want to be snappy

I don't want to be stoned
I want to feel love

I don't want to be stoned
But that's something I'm scared of

I don't want to be stoned
I want to feel clear

3,"So, i realy like this girl. The Times we have meet have ment alot to me. She makes me happy and Feel good, she makes me a stabil person, she have helped me cope with my mental health Issues.

5,"My boyfriend asked me questions about death today. What I think happens after we die, do you think a person feels it before they die unexpectedly what does it feel like when you’re dying you think. Anyway I simply took it as him wanting to have a morbid philosophical discussion but it turned out as he said that for the past couple of days he’s been constantly thinking about death and unexpectedly dying and how fragile and unpredictable life is and it’s giving him major anxiety. He says he has so many plans in life and with me and his dreams and passions and the fact that any moment he could go just worries him and how he’s been thinking about it for so long. 

He also has a habit of watching horror/scary videos right before bed every night and has recently been writing an article for a website which involves the remains of people found dead and looking at their photos. I told him that these things may have implicitly triggered information in his head about death and dying and negative thoughts in general which is probably the only reason he’s having such thoughts. It’s not a sign of anything else. While he did agree that it probably has to do with it, I could see that emotionally he was still distressed and thinking about it. 

We all get obsessive thoughts from time to time that are very distressful. It’s natural. I just want to know what I could say to him at this point that might make him feel better and less focused on this thing. What would you say to someone or if someone here experienced such thoughts, what would make you feel better?",04May2020,1
6,"My boyfriend's need to confess his intrusive thoughts is ruining our relationship. When he had OCD about our relationship he would blurt out really hurtful stuff and cried a few times like ""I thought a girl was hotter than you""/""I thought I regretted not sleeping with a few girls before you""/""I thought I wasn't attracted to you for a few minutes"" etc. and these comments almost caused me to break up with him. 

I love this man. I really do, its been nearly 2 years but his need to confess is unbearable and I can't stop him. The last few weeks he has obsessively confessed weird porn he watched when he was 11-13 or mean thoughts he has had about others or confessing to cute things he did with his ex and he feels bad cos I'm so much better or whatever. . He seems to feel unbearably guilty unless he comes to me to see if I can forgive him? It's mostly memories and a lot of it is stuff he isnt even sure happened or if he made it up from overthinking. It's hard to say no cos he'll just say ""I did something really bad once"" and my curiosity overwhelms me and I HAVE to know!! I feel like I'm his therapist. What should I do to help and get him to stop?",04May2020,1
7,"I've been on maaaany anti-depressants, anti-anxiety meds, anti-psychotics, etc. over about 8 years.  
I've had issues in the past with nightmares but it was always sporadic, on and off. Lately (the last 3-4 months), I've been having vivid dreams &amp; nightmares fairly regularly...at least 4x/week. Just wondering if anyone has experienced this too? Any suggestions on how to handle that? I've finally been on a consistent dosage/combo that seems to best help my mental health, I'd hate to have to go back to trials :(

9,"After my previous system had fallen (I don't even know if that can happen, I just remember thinking it was just a phase and that I was just imagining it all, so I thought to just silence everything and end the system.. somewhat), most got locked away for months... Some even years. Like my overemotional side that is constantly depressed and sad all the time, I didn't feel it until recently, when I got a major breakdown and cried for half an hour non stop, agonizing and wanting to end it all.

\-I just want to die already, it hurts so much to live with monsters without any humanity left in them.. I cut, yes.. It's the only way I have of showing that I exist. I'm so sorry that this body is still alive, I tried and tried, but the evil sides don't want to die, they want to be immortal, to break the rules and to kill... i don't think I ever cried so much... Someone wanted me to promise that I'll stop cutting, but.. I.. Always break this one promise... I cried in agony, not being able to scream, only letting out silent screams. I think I had flashbacks of being curled up with my hands covering my face screaming : ""Please Stop! No more! I don't want this!"" I don't know what to make of this.. Maybe it's all the times dad beat me up, maybe something else... And I guess I'm a girl.. I don't know what to make of that, I don't really have a name anymore since I got locked up after the fall.. I kinda like the names Emily, Luna, Zoey, Alice and Ivy.. I don't know which one to choose though....

\-What a sad and pathetic little child she is. I don't have much to say here except that no name is worthy enough for me to bear. I guess now that I'm this situation I must choose or else this post won't have any meaning. After some extensive research, i believe Cruciatus to be the most fitting name for me out of all.

\- Well I guess it's my time to shine. Blood and bones is all I see, also guts and eyes and especially the terrified look in their eyes. ohhh how I love to listen to their screams of misery, who doesn't like to mindlessly cut someone open and watch them bleed out, trying to escape? The sight of blood excites me beyond comprehension, or maybe sticking a knife up their chin? My little Knifey friend is a virgin, I want to make him lose his virginity and STAB someone, so he gets to feel the magnificence of blood dripping from his tip 🙃 I need to choose a name? Who needs a name if everybody's dead? Such a mood killer he is telling me I won't kill everybody.. Well seems like I have to think of one, my last name was Fouro, pretty meh I guess. Too lazy to come up with one so I'll steal Ruvik, pretty cool character imo. Also ""Cruciatus"" thinks he's evil incarnate or something of that nature lmao, so he has no gender. What about me? I'm a guy Now the ""host"" wants me to leave, but I get the music by my side, he can't stop me when my music is on Heheheheh. While I'm at it, let me say this: Did you ever see how Sexy and HOT a dismembered girl's naked body looks? That shit is just soooo fucking good, makes me hard :P

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Well that was awkward.. Like he said, music helps switching and ""boosting"" one's power. Had to switch quite a lot today I guess, now my head hurts. Welp, hope nobody's going to report this. Goodnight!",04May2020,1
10,"This has been a problem for years and can result in very awkward and ugly situations. 

I have had the issue since i was very young.

The slightest raise of tones whether it's me or another person towards me or someone i care will make me want to cry. I can go from smiling to wailing in a second and in my head i can only think *ohfuck-ohfuck-ohfuck it's happening"" and i just want to die on the spot rather than experience the embarrassment.

I don't feel sad or scared, I am not sure what I feel I just know that I want to cry and my chin does that weird trembling thing and my eyes get red and wet.

It feels like holding back the ugliest sneeze ever.

The fact that i cry so easily makes me feel pathetic and i get angry with myself but that anger changes into feeling sad for myself.

I am usually a very cheerful laid back guy and this is especially embarrassing for me.

My social life is hanging by a thread.

How do i stop this?",04May2020,1
11,"I’m a junior in college studying Cybersecurity. I have very bad imposter syndrome where I feel like I’m not deserving to be in my major. I suffer from major depression and anxiety. I no longer take my meds because they just weren’t doing it for me anymore. I’m doing well in all of my classes except for one. My professor is known for being harsh and he left an aggressive comment on one of my assignments. 

I showed it to many people that work in the field to get other opinions and they all agreed the response was very much out of line. That’s when I talked to one of the heads at my school’s center for student success about it who later referred to me to the dean. I talked to the dean and he has 5-6 students that complain about my professor a year. I told the dean to take no action because I’m afraid of retaliation.

The intensity of the course and other things happening in my life made it difficult for me to do well. First off, I was getting cyber stalked by a guy I was seeing on this platform. Secondly, my grandpa from italy died and due to the coronavirus my family couldn’t attend a funeral. There was no funeral for him sadly. I told none of my professors about my loss because I didn’t want to seem like an over emotional female. I also feel like I only had one day to grieve because the next day I had to go to my work study job. 

On the bright side in my other Cybersecurity classes I have all As in them and I also have an A in my German class. I feel like if I don’t pass the course I’ll end up acting upon my thoughts which I don’t want to do.",04May2020,1
12,"I (21) am isolating with my boyfriend in a flat above some slightly crazy neighbours. Earlier today at 3pm my bf ran down our stairs to collect a package he had been waiting all day for. My downstairs neighbour and some older relative of hers came out of their flat and started screaming at him, throwing insults at both of us, threatening with getting us evicted, insulting our appearances, it was really intense I could barely get a word in.

I have her number so I later sent her a text apologising (not that we did much to warrant that abuse) but she did not really take it very well and I instead recieved multiple huge long messages further attacking me and my bf. As soon as I had finished speaking with her over text the anxiety attack began. I have anxiety that’s really badly triggered by raised voices and aggressiveness. I must of been so stressed about trying to cool down the situation with my neighbour that it wasn’t till after I’d stopped trying to speak to her that I began physically shaking. I’ve got past the worst of it but it is now 2am and I am unable to sleep because I still feel so sick with anxiety. I don’t know how to get over it and calm down. I have such a daunting feeling in the pit of my stomach. I genuinely feel really really shaken and sort of scared of my neighbour. She’s done this before but not in a while, I’ve been too toeing around the house all day and I’ve been too scared to make noise in the kitchen so I haven’t really eaten.

Does anyone have any advice I just want to feel like it’s okay so I can sleep and maybe wake up tomorrow and not want to cry with anxiety",04May2020,1
13,"Growing up, I was very depressed because of some marks on my body. One on the wrist from self harm in seventh grade. One other on my neck that looked identical to a large hickey. I messed up a do it yourself mole removal when I was a junior in HS. It was a nightmare. I couldn't be around anyone in broad daylight with little clothing. I was only happy during cold or rainy days with sleeves and hoods to cover myself. 

""What the fuck is on your neck is that a hickey!?""

It wasn't just embarrassing around high schoolers. I could see the disgusted looks on people's faces such as my youth pastor at church. I wasn't going to tell anyone. I just had to take them damage and try to let let it kill me. You'd also think that people would figure it out it's a scar after seeing me on a consistent basis, but that's far from what the truth was.

I then started Invisalign braces. Already being so insecure about myself, I hated wearing them. I had an unavoidable lisp because I had a bite stopper for my overbite. Along with that plastic aligners were the white chunks all over the teeth. I also had white spots from stains that were on them my teeth which were a bit yellow to begin with. When I finished Invisalign, it left me with a severe posterior open bite that is still not completely fixed.

""What the fuck's wrong with your teeth?!""

I had to hide socially for a long time because of comments like these. By the time this braces journey began, my scars were, for the most part, faded and bot noticeable. I was still very insecure about my teeth. This was when my ear began to start popping non stop. Soon after this ear popping began, I met my dream girl. I had already had a crush on this girl, but I didn't fall in love until after my ear had began popping. This was also the time where things didn't work out with my dream girl.

I now look in the mirror and see a handsome young man. My scars are faded. My teeth are good. I'm so happy about that, but my head is furthest from healthy. I've ridded myself of a tremendous amount of social anxiety because of my appearance, but I'm constantly panicking due to my overall situation in life. I really really miss this girl. It's an extremely severe obsession and my right side eustachian tube pops several thousands of times on many nights when I try to sleep. This popping in my ear has been going on for about four years now. Every day. I think I may be a good candidate for a diagnosis of some sort of psychogenic movement disorder. When I'm in the midst of a night's sleep is when my popping is most rapid and intense. I'm always panicking and panicking. This is what makes me the most suicidal. This non stop popping in my ear.",04May2020,1

15,"My dad (46 years old) has never struggled with mental illness before and is normally a perfectly happy person. However, after the COVID19 hit and the stock market fell, he lost some money which led to some major behavior changes. At first, he would just talk to himself a lot and take a lot of deep sighs and but my family figured he had gone through a difficult situation and was dealing with it and would get better. We helped with the money situation, by getting a professional to take care of finances so he wouldn't have to stress. 

However, over the last two weeks he just keeps getting worse. He yells out loud very often (like almost screaming) and keeps repeating ""why didn't I sell them before."" Also, he is never in the present. If anyone speaks to him, he doesn't process it cause he is stuck in his own head and when he speaks, it feels like he is reading off a script. With this, I mean that he isn't speaking in his normal voice and is completely monotone. He also can't sleep at night, pulls at his hair, and makes a face of deep pain like he is going to cry but he never does. 

He said that he has a deep fear now that the stock market will fall and he can't stop thinking about it. He even acknowledges that if it falls, it won't affect him, but he can't get rid of this fear which is causing extreme anxiety. With this, we believe he has a sort of OCD and anxiety and it gets way worse in the evenings but it is present all day and all night. 

We talked to a doctor who gave him anxiety medication but that only seems to make it worse. I don't know how to help him, and it is really difficult for my whole family now. 

I was wondering if anyone has had similar experiences or knows how I can help my dad? I really appreciate any advice. Thank you!",04May2020,1

17,"This happens to me occasionally. I'm in the middle of a conversation and I can't find the right words to say or I'm saying the wrong words to describe something. And it aggravates me. What's even worse is that I google why this is occurring and nothing comes up but ""Why is it that you cannot come up with words when you're angry?""  BUT I WAS NOT ANGRY UNTIL THAT HAPPENED. 

That was supposed to be it but to hell with it, I'm just going to get sh\*t off my chest now. I've told my friends but they never cared. The very worse you guys could do is give me the same treatment. 

My OCD is getting bad. I keep thinking about pencils going through my hand and it freaks me out. I've implemented a ritual to deal with it but that does not work. There have been times where I thought that I might do it to give me the relief and that scared me. I'm hoarding pornography. First it started with me writing URLS in a book when I was a pre-teen, then bookmarking videos( then again, I bookmark everything I've opened just In case I need it) and now I'm downloading. I barely ever go back to watch anything so it's literally there just because if it's not there, it'll be on my mind forever. I feel like my OCD has evolved from the symptoms everyone assumes people with OCD have to the crazy symptoms. At one point it was sexual OCD and now I'm scared I want to put a pencil through my palms. I used to be a perfectionist that cared about order ans symmetry but things changed and became more violent and weird. Perhaps it's the household I live in but I don't know.

I'm afraid of blood and violence even if it's just a cartoon like Family guy. That is evidently not normal.

I daydream for hours at a time thinking about how much of a successful person the future me is while being broke and get nothing done. I'm a dunce, a literal dunce. I constantly argue with people I disagree with, even if we agree with 99.9% of things. That 0.1% gets to me. I hate arguing, it just happens. 

I have severe anxiety in public. Sweaty hands, not being able to be still (ever, I must move or stand), heart palpitations, heavy sweating, stomach aches (mainly in Uni, goes away afterwards). I even stopped going to classes and one of the main reasons why I go to school is because I need to get out of this house and that's one of the two places I could go to. But I avoid places with plenty of people staring and when I'm forced into those situations, I get paranoid. Even when I'm alone, my anxiety sneaks up on me.

I procrastinate everyday. I've wanted to start a YouTube channel for the last 6 years. Literally everyday, I said tomorrow. Everyday. I tried putting deadlines...Nothing. So I put the ultimate deadline of if I don't accomplish what I need to accomplish by the age of 30, I'll just end it. Then I lowered that to 25 when I did poorly in my exams. Nothing has changed. Either I'll do it or I'll pussy out because of my fear of pain.

I can't talk to women without my leg shaking uncontrollably and my heart just beating noticeably (to me obviously) hard. 

I worry hard about what people think about me and I wonder if I'm overstaying my welcome. When in front of my friend's friends, I wonder if they hate me because of the way I talk (I cuss a lot) and act. Some of them look t me weird. 

One time I had a manic episode and got a stupid Pinterest tattoo on my foot and another one on my wrist and also bought a thousand dollar watch without reason (at least I got into watches). The tattoo on my wrist hurt me more mentally than physically while getting it. There are long periods of time where I wonder how the hell I got tattoos considering my fear of pain and needles and basically sharp things. Other times, I'm fully motivated to get a tattoo. I'm becoming irritable af as of late.

There was a girl I liked that my close friend actually liked as well. Obviously I didn't chase after her (chase isn't the word I want to use but it's better to use that than destroy my computer from the anger of not remembering the word I usually use) and obviously he did and succeeded. And then he tried to jokingly run me over with his car with her watching. And tried to fight me with her watching saying that I wanted her because I talked to her a lot. But I never went after her or even explicitly said I liked her or anything. I was even more mean to her because my naive ass thought that that's how I could convince him that I wasn't after her. Of course, both made me paranoid, laughed behind my back but fronted to my face and then acted like they were victims when his (possibly) drunk ass almost crushed her. I tried to be there for them even after all the BS but they didn't want me there. I saw her one time in the mall and smiled while her hand was in her cast and her eyes bruised and I think she took it as me laughing at her. Still worried about that for no reason because those two never cared for me and likely don't think about me now. Man I suck!   

I'm depressed but that's obvious. Should just blow my brains out because of my stupidity but to die a failure draws me back into reality. I'm a clusterf\*\*k of emotions and contradictions. I suck. I really suck. Prozac does not work. Therapy scares me since I have trust issues.

18,"Hi! So for the past few months I've been writing a book about my friend who was involved in a dark web organization at a very young age all the way until now to this day. From what I know about simple psychology based on my own experience I decided to not let his story go to waste. He used to run a blog on the tor browser and on the ""Rambles"" tab he would talk about his life struggles. So I decided to make a fictional story based around his life. Of course I couldn't just write about his life due to the lack of story in the blog, but I instead of making up a story I also merged in my own experience with mental illness.

20,"*Pr-amble: I am not trying to claim that I have been clinically diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or any mental health disorder. I understand that people live through how I feel regardless of their situations and while I will never know exactly how they feel, I try my best to empathize with what they have to go through daily.♥*

I have always been an anxious and emotional person but I am REALLY struggling through this quarantine. I am not even very social but I just feel sad all the time being so isolated and trapped. It's also when I start to think of all the things I have to do or can't do anymore. Sometimes it just feels like there is no point.

I work at an elementary school with differently-abled kids and it is so hard to think that I may not be able to physically see them until 2021 and seeing them online is just not the same. I also live in an apartment with a new puppy on the third floor and a cat who she wants to chase all the time. On top of that, my neighbors bellow me started cussing at me today while I was watering my plants on the patio. Taking care of my plants is one of the few things that actually give me joy right now and I don't even want to go out there now because I am afraid she will do it again. I feel so overwhelmed, trapped, and sick to my stomach when I think about the uncertainty of all of this.

I feel like I am missing out on the joys of life because my mind is always so full of worry and doubt that everything will be okay. I have a hard time lately seeing the good in situations that should be memorable or fun.

I am sorry for the rant but I feel so alone and don't want to constantly wear on my partner who is experiencing worries of his own.

I do not consider myself a person who is at high risk for self-harm or anything like that but I just don't know how to get through the days feeling like this anymore. I just want to lay in bed all day and keep the world out but I know that's not good for me.

Is anyone else experiencing this at this time?

22,"A few months before spring I started working on a shawl I had planned it for months and months and was always talking to everybody about how I’m gonna make a shawl and have sunflowers embroidered onto it and how exited I was.

For Christmas I got yarn cause at the time I was super into crochet, and I started work on it a little while later. So I started work on it later in December and after along time (around 6 hours) and a ton of weekends and aching hands I was halfway done.

My dad walked into my room at around 10:00 at night and asked what I was doing and after explaining, he told me that what I was making was stupid and how under his watch I’ll never be allowed to wear something stupid like that.

It. Crushed. Me. I cried myself to sleep for a while cause until now I thought they were supportive but he came into my room and said what I loved to do was stupid.

So I stopped that project and didn’t do any others for a long long time cause they hated what I wanted to do so what’s the point. This coupled with my sexuality and school contributed to my depression and suicidal thoughts that I had for a long time.

Now tonight we were talking and I brought it up and my dad basically said “wow I didn’t know I said that” sounds good but then he told me “but I was saying the truth, I’d never let you leave with some scarf on”

He and my mother continued to laugh at me and say stuff like “that would be a nice gift for your grandma” and “you should thank me for stopping you from being bullied”

At last my dad told me “I’m sorry I said that, but again I was doing it to protect you” I was done with his s*** so I told him “oh so what your saying is I’m sorry I hurt your feelings but I did nothing wrong so really you should thank me”

He shut up but kept saying the same thing about how he was sorry but I did it to protect you, I kept saying what I said in my last paragraph and he shut up and changed the subject.

I currently work as a web developer, in the process of migrating to game development. I still don't work with games but I'm almost there.  
I have been working hard this past year but I am not satisfied with the results. I feel that I am on the right path but I am feeling very exhausted.

I have no energy in my body and mind. The lack of energy takes away my desire to do anything. I feel like my head is sleepy, thoughts are foggy and I can't reason as I used to. As a programmer, I see my logic getting weaker and weaker. I feel myself getting more and more ""dumb"". Even my current job is in a good company, but even it is unbearable.

Anyway, I don't know what's going on with me. I'm finally getting something I've always wanted but it seems like my body and mind don't not follow.

Does anyone know what's going on? What do you suggest?  
Has anyone been through something like this?   
Any kind of advice is welcome.

Thank you",04May2020,1

for me the physical anxiety is a layer of fog surrounding my heart getting so dense near the heart itself it’s almost a solid but then it gets less and less dense the father away it gets from the heart and it goes through the walls of the lungs too like they aren’t even there and stops by the time it reaches the outside of the ribs.

27,"Husband has finally admitted that he was emotionally abused as a child. He wasn’t allowed to have emotions, was locked in his room for hours if upset, was left with various nannies, and was never allowed to seek comfort.

Now, he struggles with being too adaptable (doing whatever other people want) and thinking he’s a terrible person while pedestalizing others. He would have gone to any ends of the earth to get his family to accept him just a few months ago.

This is something he has finally admitted he struggles with and he asked me how to start working on these issues, especially with his mom and somewhat with his dad (both were extremely cold and punishment heavy). His one condition is that he doesn’t want therapy since he’s had bad experiences with multiple therapists in the past.

Any advice on how to get him started? Books he could read, podcasts, YouTube channels, etc. he’s super nervous and is wanting me to help him figure out where to go from here. TIa!

29,"I'm 26 from California, USA.

The latter half of 2019 up to now was nothing but downhill for me. 

I went through two family deaths, a big car accident, and a suicide attempt. Then COVID and this Shelter In-Place happened. The high levels of isolation is driving me insane, anxious, depressed, and suicidal. Social media and the news is nothing, but COVID and I will get shunned upon by these people if I get caught going outside just to take care of myself. I lost one of my best friends through a bunch of arguments that built up and exploded in the end. I truly feel alone in this world, and I want to be stronger from this. Right now, after the relationships that were ruined, I want to learn how to fend for myself without anyone, y'know?

I contemplated on suicide last night, but never did it because I have this tiny bit of hope that things will get better. I ghosted all of my meetings and conversations with other people because my level of anxiety just spikes easily now. I uninstalled FaceBook and Instagram because there's nothing except COVID-this, COVID-that, ""stay home or kill your grandma"" posts...

So now, after a lot of contemplation, I realized that I need to change my mindset and my lifestyle to help me feel better about myself. I'm not sure where to start. I know exercising will help a bit for me, especially with my self-image. I also want to go back to some hobbies, such as singing, dancing, and reading to distract myself from everything in this world. I haven't been sleeping well for the past 2 months because I deal with insomnia. 

If you have any pointers in where to start in taking care of myself, that'll be great. I know these suicidal thoughts will come back again, but I wanna make sure to control it better in the long-run. Thank you.",04May2020,1

31,"Please wait before you jump to any conclusions and let me explain myself. So as a child I suffered from a significant amount of abuse physical, sexual, and mental. Just to say the least I'm proud fucked up but i want to take a journey to figure somethings out. 
  I suggest if you don't want to listen sign off now it might get a bit iffy. 
   So why not start at the beginning right my ma was very mentally ill and still is. She had the baby blues when she had my older brother and tried to suffocate him. I know, I know what does this have to do with me well lets just say it only go worse with her. Custody was given to my grandma on my dads side because my dad was too busy with work and when my ma had me she would have fits of rage from time to time. It got so bad she would throw knifes at my dad with me in his hands. They ended up getting divorced over her cheating and neglecting to take care of me or my brother leaving it up to my grandma and aunt.
 Moving on to more trauma along with getting bullied at school, and my brother despising me my elementary school days were filled with mostly physical abuse. First it was my dads gf Sara she hated my brother and i. She at one point threw my brother out of the car on the side of the highway and started to drive away as I screamed in the back seat to stop, my dad stopped the car and my brother got back in. Another one of my big memories with her is when she took the trash bin from outside and dumped out all the trash out in our room (my brother and i shared a room at the time). She didn't let us out or let us eat for the whole day and i was only 5-6 at this time. 
 The next person is where my memories get iffy around 3rd-4th grade my dad had shattered a few discs in his lower back from a work accident. We ended up not being able to pay bills anymore and had to move. While moving to place to place my dad had met another woman. Mary. Fun fact my therapist calls this time my cinderella story now allow me to tell you why. She had 7 children and my brother and i were forced to do everything around the house and me being a strong willed and headstrong child she would threaten me with throwing me down the stairs, harming my brother, or locking me under the stairs. I don't remember much from this time but i do remember her encouraging her children to gang up on my brother and me. The boys got in to fist fights a lot because of it and for me the 2 youngest girls would hit me with anything they could find. I remember getting put in the closet under the stairs with my worst fear at the time spiders and was locked in and laughed at. I was blamed for anything that happened there. I also can partially remember getting beat and thrown outside and also sleeping on the concrete in front of the fireplace in the middle of winter. 
 
Theres 2 traumatic events I'll tell but not go into details too much before i leave this post to get taken down within 5 mins. 

I was raped 3 times with in these last 5 years one of the guys is in jail. He was my friends dad and I thought of him as a father figure. He threatened if i ever ""tattled"" on him he would kill me. I was 11. The other 2 were guys that i knew through friends. 

And last but not least lets top this off with murder. A very sweet lady i knew because of my best friend was murdered within 2 blocks of me and my friend we both saw her as a mother figure/family. 

 So other then the bullying, cheating, lying, and those kinds of traumas you've read it all. I have major ptsd and large gaps in my memories at times. 
 The questions i have are:
  1. What made it so i didn't come out of all of this with any worse mental health issues?
  2. What can i do to get the memories back?

Sorry not sorry this was so long but I figured I might as well give as much details as i can muster and if you have any questions please feel free to ask.",04May2020,1

Hi. I haven’t posted before, so let me try to get this right.

I want to put my story somewhere. Maybe someone can understand? Or maybe I just sound like I’m spewing nonsense. Be as harsh as you want. Maybe it’ll help me find my answer.

Before I start, let me say that I’m not on drugs. I’ve never used them. I also don’t have anything that would allow this to make sense. I’m just saying the things that I believe to be true most of the time.

A while ago, I became a “new person.” I don’t remember much about my past self, or how “I” came around. I still share the same name and natural traits (gender, sexuality, ect.) but I’m not her. I feel like she was lost. She went away. I believe she died in a way, and I had to replace her.

I know neither of us believed religion ever. None of this makes sense.

I know it had to happen, but things were starting to look up. I still don’t understand what went wrong.

I still have similar interests, but I reject everything heavily associated with it. It gets overwhelming to keep that stuff in my head.

I don’t want to be here, but other people want me here. I feel like she should be here. I don’t have any deep connections to anyone most of the time. I just want to leave, but I know doing so would hurt others, and it’s not my body to throw away.

I wish she would come back.",04May2020,1

Lots of really hard things have happened in the last year. All of which lead me to slowly drift away from people without even realizing it.

37,"TLDR: I don’t care about anything but I’m not sad and I don’t hate myself. Suicide seems rational but I can’t be bothered.

Let me preface this by saying that I don’t hate myself, I don’t think I’m ugly, I’m not sad over someone dying/not loving me back, I don’t think I’m a worthless piece of shit, etc etc etc.

I’m fine with my appearance, my abilities, who I am as a person. I hate saying this because I’ll always end up sounding like some edgy kid but I just really don’t care about anything. I’ve never had any real ambition, drive, motivation, or goal to pursue so I’ve always just gone with the flow or taken the path of least resistance. After high school I went to college because that’s what you do no? I applied for an engineering major because I show aptitude for science so sure, stem, let’s go.

Afterwards I went to graduate school. Why? It was that or work and I got my acceptance letter before I heard back from any of the job applications I sent out. That’s where I am now.

I’ve never had particularly strong feelings about anything, I’ve never felt any sort of real bond with other people. As a kid I think other people felt I was odd or distant so I was mostly ignored. I made friends in high school but it was one of those “this is a group of people I just spend time with” kind of things. I keep in touch with one friend from high school because we just meet up and catch up when I’m in town, otherwise we don’t speak.

I have one “close friend”, the only one I’ve ever had, that I’ve actively kept up with since undergrad. It’s primarily because of effort on their part although I do reciprocate. I think they find my being super accepting of other people (I don’t care enough to judge) and willingness to indulge other people’s interests comforting. I like them and I enjoy speaking to them but if they left, I’d be fine and get over it.

I’ve dated before “to see what happens”. I don’t think I ever even had any real romantic interest in them or anybody, so those things never lasted wrong. I was never upset about it. I haven’t bothered dating since after high school (it feels cruel on my part) and I haven’t been interested or felt drawn to anybody. I don’t understand what people mean when they say they “feel close” to someone.

As a kid I understood that my mindset isn’t typical. Suicide is something that’s always been at the back of my mind since middle school but it’s not some “I can’t deal with life, it hurts” kind of thing, it’s just “why not when I care so little”. There are times when I’ve felt down but I mostly just feel empty. I go through life robotically.

I’m not actively suicidal, there's so much work and research involved and I'll definitely have a reason to be if I fuck it up and I end up with a blown off jaw or paralyzed, but it feels like some sort of inevitability that’s always in the back of my mind. I exist just to exist, I’m already here so sure lets put some effort into things and not be a total waste of space, but why am I doing these things? They mean nothing to me.

I have hobbies to keep me my mind occupied, I crochet, I draw, I study, I’ll play video games. Do I enjoy them? I don’t know, I just like having something to do although sometimes I’m equally satisfied just laying in bed and staring at the ceiling.

Everything I’ve written up until now makes total sense to me.

Here’s when I’ll admit I start sounding off. I don’t think I was ever meant to exist. My mother was on the verge of dying giving birth to me. The only reason she didn’t is because some doctor that happened to drop by (they weren’t supposed to be there) that day knew what to do and was able to direct the other medical staff. I didn’t know this until I was an adult so it’s not like this was a catalyst for the way I think. It was more of an “oh that makes sense” moment, but that’s just confirmation bias no?

I don't think i'm a nihilist. I don’t think there’s real meaning to anything or a reason for anybody to exist but I think self-appointed meaning is just as valid as any sort of significance granted on a cosmic/spiritual level. I just don’t seem capable of giving that to myself.

Anyway, any of this make sense? It does to me. Or am I fucked in the head?

P.S: Thank you to anyone willing to read all of this.",04May2020,1

We're concerned because my sister has a prescription to some narcotics for anxiety and drinks a good deal on the weekends.  


She's very responsible and very dependable but my question is how can I be, because she shouldn't be expected to have a very high level of self-care right now, or should she?

I think when she talked to him a few days ago she said she didn't want to talk to him anymore because he was using, so I imagine she feels guilt. She's very smart but can also be superstitious.

• I’ve been having more “down” days. Where I feel hopeless or like I’m stuck. 
• When I feel down, it no longer feels like it’s just in my head. But it takes over my body. My chest feels tight. I feel like I can’t move. I feel like my insides are curled up, hollowed, or like they’re sinking. (I hope that’s a decent description.)
• I’ve been really missing my mom. She’s alive, and lives just 40 min away. I don’t make it home often because of work. But lately I’ve come to the realization that ‘wow, no one loves you more than your mom’ and my insides start to sink again, I start bawling, and feeling terrible about how simple it all used to be. How I never took advantage of the days when I was back home spending time with her. How I never thanked her enough for all that she’s done for me. 
• I’ve spent years trying to gain the things that I have now. And now that my dream life is here, I feel incapable enjoying it. I feel so dissatisfied even though I thought I knew what I wanted. I always changed my environment — my location, my job, my friends. I was hoping I’d become a better product of my environment and that this would satisfy me. It hasn’t. 
• I make big issues of small things. (Thinking calling out of work one day would get me fired, thinking if I don’t show up to a social event I’ll let down others.) This usually results in me stuck on the couch, unable to move, tight chest, bawling. 

I’m really stuck here. Can anyone help me?",04May2020,1

I feel like whenever I'm around people, I still feel alone, and I'm constantly unhappy with myself, sad/mad about previous ""failures"" that have occurred in my life, or just feeling numb and unresponsive to any sort of emotion. I used to be extremely social and would love to spend time with other people, but now I just don't feel like talking to anyone, except when I feel like I'm losing hold of myself and just need someone to talk to so I can feel alive and like I exist. It's gotten to the point where when I'm extremely quiet, downtrodden, or downright emotionless or not emotionally or mentally present, people just think that's the way I am. Whenever I try to open up to people about these struggles, including my own family members and friends, they don't take me seriously, and I feel like sometimes I'm just searching for pity or something. I literally came home every single day last year and laid on my bed and cried, and when I'm with other people I'm like a robot, just greeting them occasionally and making stupid small talk that doesn't mean anything to me at all. Now I'm also afraid of being too dependent on other people for anything, even as friends, because I feel like I may just be a burden or I may exploit others unintentionally just to make me feel a little bit better. I feel like I'm just in a pit of anxiety, self hatred, and it doesn't help that I just can't trust many people anymore since I'm always available to help others but when I need help they just turn their backs on me. I didn't even realize there was anything wrong with me until recently, since I've been living like this for so long.

The current quarantine measures have worsened this obsessive line of thinking, and my usual affirmation is not working as it used to - “I’m not suicidal. Three mental health professionals have assured you of this. You have obsessive compulsive disorder, and this is a symptom of it.” Any advice on dealing with these thoughts during this rough period?

I'm concerned about her mental health. In high school she was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. At sixteen she was falsely accused of assault. She is a very loving, gentle and kind girl. She would never hurt anyone.

But lately, over the last six months, our intimate moments have become rough. Very rough. She will slap me, bite my lips, neck, breasts etc. I don't really mind this, and didn't think much of it until i decided to look through her internet history.

Things have been a lot better since I got here, it’s been about a month. We live with his grandparents, parents and two little brothers. They’re the family unit I’ve always wanted to be apart of and it’s amazing!

My problem is that I still have my days where I’m miserable, obviously my disorder wasn’t going to disappear. Nothing triggers it, I just wake up and I feel empty, nothing matters, I’m physically and mentally exhausted and I just want to sit on the couch in our room and stare into space.

I don’t know if anyone else has ways that they can mask their episodes so that I can atleast put on a facade of ‘I’m fine’ and just stay like that until the episode passes. And secondly I don’t know what to tell him when he begs to know what’s wrong.

I discovered the first trigger when i was listening to Red Extensions of Me by The Flashbulb, I think the song was Sensual Data, and it had a sample of somebody singing in a soft whisper voice ""it's a beautiful day outside"". I had to stop the song and go sit in my kitchen away from my computer because I almost burst into tears. I can't exactly pin point why. The general reason is because of my agoraphobia. But idk what about it makes me tear up. 

Second trigger is Skyrim music. The music is fine but it brings me back to a time in my life where my brain was at peace. Where I would play Skyrim and whatnot. I can still play Skyrim but I have to have the sound off or I get super depressed

Many times after we came we said we shouldn't do it again, as we thought it was wrong since we were very young and we were both males. We both ended up being gay, and now sometimes he accuses me of ""making him gay"" since he says I was the one who wanted it to happen first (I really don't remember because we were about 8 or something). I feel bad and i've talked to him and he always says to me that he doesn't consider it rape but he still tells people that he was ""Kinda raped"".  


We once went to a psychologist together, since when we were 17 and it was still happening and he got his parents involved and it was a huge issue, so they went to a psychologist and made an appointment with me and my parents. He then told the psychologist I raped him. I tried to talk to him, my parents and his parents that it was something consensual and that he also looked for me.  He kinda forced me into coming out to my parents with this and I was only 17 (he was one year younger that me)

83,"I'm (20f)  not sure how to explain this exactly, but I am increasingly becoming afraid that when I die, my thoughts/opinions/views/character/etc. will never be known by anyone. Not just by everyone in my life, but by anyone at all, even just one person. I also fear being forgotten about after I die. I'm not terminally ill or suicidal, but I keep getting extremely anxious that I'll die in a freak accident or from a dumb mistake and nobody will ever know what ""who"" I truly was.

I know this sounds a bit ridiculous and I'm sure everyone shares this fear. But its affecting me on a daily basis now and it never leaves my mind. I constantly feel the need to write down all my thoughts and share my ideas and views in the hopes that if/when I die, somebody can piece it all together to know who I was.

I have never felt this in my life. This started becoming really apparent about two or three months ago I'd say. I have become so paranoid that I'll suddenly die or lose the ability to share whats in my head that I've started to try and figure out a sort of doomsday device (dont laugh at me lmao) that goes off in case that happens. I want the passwords to all my accounts given to somebody in case something happens. That way they can see what I think or talk about (good or bad) and share who I actually was. 

I even reached out to a close friend recently and told him that in case I die, I want him to have access to my accounts and things online because I know he cares about me enough to look through some of it. I made sure that he knew I wasn't suicidal tho, obviously. We had a small conversation about it but I dont want to make him worry or anything so I never brought it up again. He wasnt alarmed or confused really, he just was reassuring me that he'd want to help in the event that it happens. 

I'm not necessarily scared of being *misunderstood*, but more scared of not being understood...if that makes any sense. I'm worried about being forgotten, while not to the same extent, but a lot too. I'm not really scared of dying or death itself, tho.

I'm sorry if this is hard to follow. Now that I'm writing this, I cant help but wonder if I'm writing this as a way to feed into this obsession. I'm sure everyone worries about this, but is it bad that I worry about this specific thing all day every day? Is that normal? I dont particularly enjoy drawing or writing but I do it so often now because I feel like I have to. I even started ""googling"" things in case when I die, somebody looks through my search history. I dont actually care about the results from googling random things, I just am making any desperate attempt I can think of. It makes me really uncomfortable. I genuinely am fixated on this.

I'm sorry if this makes me seem selfish or full of myself. I dont think I'm unique or important to the history of humankind or anything, I just think my greatest fear is never being understood. I'm serious when I say it never leaves my mind now. It drains a lot of my energy.

I lived the most tender and moral setting part of my life (birth thru adolescence to young adulthood) to understand at 20 years of age in this lifetime what life is all about, yet again. 
I lived long enough sober with this realization, this hidden truth that no one wants mention, that life is what you make of it until it’s over. And when it’s over is what i can’t get out of my head. Not a fear of it, not anxiety of it, but complete acceptance and anticipation of it. 
I’m a sober being for the most part, besides smoking cannabis but that’s a habit i really started getting into the older i got. I dabbled in whatever other pills and powders in high school and never got into em. I found the start of my spiritual journey in psychedelics when i got into that wave and it’s honestly passed. 
So with that being said, i live a spiritual type of lifestyle, one of my choosing fit to the way i see my life playing out which is eventful to say the the least, boring to say the most.

I can choose to spice it up as much as i want, but at the end of the day, it’s the same day, over and over, the same made up emotions, words, feelings, friends, foes, family, belief and moral systems, routine activity and “random” happenings. It’s so meticulous. So crude. So boring. I’m honestly bored of being a human being. I know the power of my being, if you could see the state of my mental health now versus a year and prior, you’d be proud of me.

Time moves fast when you believe in the concept of time, but if you try to put that concept up against the concept of pure existence, you’d understand why i’m just not joyous about a day to day existence. I wake up, no longer mentally within the days of the week or even applying time for any specific use other than when to speak to my people, i go through the same shit as usual, quarantine or not my day is not different. I’d otherwise be at my job setting for the 8 hours and back home. 
I no longer feel the want or need to participate in this crazy fucking thing called life. (air quotations with extra eye roll and cringe effect). I. Am. Fucking. Bored. Bored of the stench that i’m subjected to intaking everyday, the stench of a systemized version of what used to be, a capitalists dream, a free spirits nightmare. 

Money used to be but no longer is a motivator or key factor in my existence. As i’ve come to the understanding that it’s just another thing to keep a being, whos not in tune with the true nature of existence, in line with the illusion of free will. It’s a shame that i have to pretend i don’t want to die and continue to live each day. It honestly is, and don’t give me the but what about your parents. Because 24 grand and 8 months ago, my single mom passed away. I came to terms with it as i try to move on and live life in a way that was originally foreign but now i realize was only a part of the plan anyways. It’s part of the monotony. 
I miss my mom everyday, but i don’t cry as hard as i used to, i still shed a tear but i know that her soul was one that was pure and the energy that captivated her being is now apart of the energy that captivates our existence. 
I continue to move on though, day by day, week by week, month by month, yet, none of the accomplishments mean anything to me but some talking point to pin up on the wall for when i pass, so people can pull it down and re-talk about it at the funeral. 
I guess this was supposed to be a turn around post from me just wanting to fade out of my body into existence, to me talking about how good life can be for those needing to hear it. 
Although my current headset seems rather grim, it doesn’t at all reflect the state of my life or the rest of me for that matter. My life is going great, i’m just kind of checking out early if you get what i’m saying. I’m choosing to, at 20, appreciate the scope of the entire thing than appreciate the smaller wins and losses in the day to day because i see how they are all the same. They all have the same lesson, to be happy about what you’ve done or move on and make a better choice the next time. 
But anyways, my life is good. The day of my moms funeral, i got a job offer that changed everything, put money in my pockets i’ve never fathomed of attaining in any way that was legal. Showed me how you can catch a quick dub in a dark time, but nonetheless, money doesn’t replace my parent. The memories of her are all i have left, yet when i die, all of thats going to be gone, which leaves me thinking, “fuck, how much of life should i care about and how much should i take with a grain of salt for the pure fact that the moment i go, none of it will mean anything as i will have a new purpose as one with the true god of our existence, which happens to be pure existence itself.” 
In other words, life can be the greatest thing in the world if that’s how much you value your life. My life doesn’t have a price value to me. Not saying that my price value is $0, but saying that the energy that captivates my being currently, my soul, transcends and lives in existence at all times so, this human thing just doesn’t mean as much as that does to me. 
What i’m saying is, life is a hell of a thing. It’s almost complex, it is if that’s how you choose to perceive it. But, it’s rather simple actually. It’s just exactly what it is. Existence, but from the confines of a human being on a planet that we formerly used for exploration, currently are using to tap dry of its resources and destroy its natural flow, and possibly probably not but in some form of a future will have to go on to complete space integration and exploration becoming a multi planetary species. 
There’s a lot that life has to offer of the forced direction our worlds leaders are pushing it in. Like literally, just say fuck it and do what makes you comfortable. Because that’s what this damn party’s all about man, it is an experience. A nonstop experience whether you are a part of it in human form or in form of a piece of the outer source that is the totality of existence. 
Be who you want to be, no matter what the cost is, whether it be monetary or whatever else, because why? That’s all you got. Do what you love, what makes you feel good. 
And don’t tell me take my own advice because I do, it’s just, i see too clearly what this is and in every moment experience what exactly this is and i just get it man. Some people are jazzed when they come to the realization that life is literally what you make of it, and that the sky is the limit when you allow it to be. Me? I realized it for the first time at 2 years old when my grandma passed away in front of my very eyes. And again when i was maybe around 7 or 8 years old, when my older brother went to live with his father and left me and mom alone. 
And then again at age 12 when i decided i wanted to have a music career and start a music label collective. Again, at age 19 during the midst of a deep salvia experiment, playing with the extents of my mind space and searching for some answers about some negative feelings i had throughout my life and came out of that experiment a fully spiritual being  and completely changed man. A and then again at age 20, months before the death of my only parental figure, where my music collective had been officially running for nearly 8 years and i had dropped a single that reached my first 100,000 streams on one song. And again after my mom passed in november and the end of the year was here and i looked at how much work i had put in towards the collective and realized it had done over half a million plays in 2019 alone. And again now, as i’m sitting here, writing this very long narrative. 
I took like by the neck at every moment i could and shook the fucking opportunity out of it, until the opportunity of the moment was mine. And continue to do so, but with the mindset, that this isn’t even for me at this point. I don’t care too much about what’s left. I really don’t care, whether the success of my career continues or falls, the success of my music continues or halts, whether i continue on earth or retract to pure existence. 
At this point, i can’t commit suicide. I made some promises that i’d half to deal with before i got to where i needed to go next. But the thing is, my death would do so much more good than harm because of the frequency in which the people that surround me choose to indulge themselves in. One that consists of frustration due to lack of monetary gain, even though money continues flows in it continues to flow right back out, and they lack the depth on innerstanding to get past this state of being and accept that it’s all a part of keeping up this fucking circus. 
It’s tiring having to play along with it, the not knowing, because who wants to feel like an idiot for not being able to speak outwardly of clairvoyance because society is known to shun those that don’t fall in line with paradigm. 
Nonetheless, you are free to be who you want to be because free will is the end goal we are all chasing. We all want to feel like we are in control, so we stick to a routine that feels natural to us, although that’s the exact thing that causes the monotony i feel and honestly can’t stand. 
So, be in control. Positive phrases like anything’s possible, and the sky is the limit, are literal phrases. Do what you want man, you got a life to live here so live it. 
Peace and one love to all. 🙌🏾",04May2020,1

100,"I'm currently a 23 year old student which is stuck in my own world that i created. I've been living with my mom and dad for my whole life, but it was never a normal way of living. My dad used to be alcohol addicted from my age of 8 until 12 and than he went to rehab.  


Two years later he developed cancer due to smoking. He had it removed and it came back for another time. After removing it this time it was gone for good. At my age of 15 until now he became addicted to alcohol, as well as heavy sleeping medication. The amount he takes would put a normal person easily into a coma of 1 week.   


When he used the alcohol and medication at the same time he would be really unpredictable en wasn't able to walk normally. He falls occasionally from the stairs to the ground floor and i have to call the ambulance, because my mother is 9/10 times out working. I've fought with him once and that moment isn't fading away since than. Every time i hear a loud bang without me noticing, my whole body starts shaking and i panic.   


i always used gaming as my escape, but everything is catching up now. I wasn't able to tell any of my feelings to my formarly girlfriend. Even the smallest annoyance wouldn't be told by me. Until this day i can't express my feelings until it gets to the point i just errupt in tears or anger or anxiety. I've numbed myself with gaming up to the point i can't recognise my own feelings. MY girlfriend tried to tell me that i needed help, but i thought i was fine, until 2 months ago. My dad tried to drill a hole in his stomach and i saw it happening before me. I ran upstairs and was shaking and crying for two days. Since that day i can't listen to any emotional music without heavy pain inside me and just crying. Every time i let my emotions in i'm not able to control them anymore and they overflow me.   


I'm stuck in this situation right now. I still live with both my parents, but i don't know how to handle this anymore. I feel like ive done so much wrong in this time period. Only if i seeked and wanted help before it was too late. I still would've have had this amazing relationship and i would be able to just express my feelings. Every day i just feel like im losing more grip on everything and feel like nobody really understands me beside my formarly girlfriend. I try to talk to my friends and i feel fine for a couple of hours, until everything just comes back.   


I hope someone has advice for me or just have some good words. I just hope some day i can feel better.",04May2020,1
101,"TLDR: I moved from a big nobody cares who you are city to a small everyone knows everyone small town/city. I've  been married for nearly ten years but found it difficult to make friends or engage with people in my community for years because I've been labelled as a ""lying online catfisher!"" 

To give some brief context: I'm a black guy who married an attractive white woman.
I don't claim to be beautiful or attractive, Infact I've been called ugly more times than I can count lol... 7 years ago though I moved  to a new country to be with a woman who became my wife who I met online.

I thought it was going to be all good. 

However I got depressed when I moved and developed psychosis and the main feature of this depression/psychosis is being heard or seen. I really have this complex about people judging how I speak or how I look when I'm speaking. I moved to another English speaking country but with my accent in my mind I feel I stand out so I have developed behavior whereby I lower my volume of my voice whenever I perceive I could be heard by strangers or my neighbors...

Sidenote: actually I remember recently learning about a statistic that showed immigrants were prone to high levels of mental health issues. I look around and I see the locals who have lived in this city all their lives with their family and friends and then there's me, I have no family but my wife and no friends.


I want to recover...i really do...but it seems the small community that I moved to 7 years ago has had tagged me as a hardcore ""catfisher"" and when I'm indoors or out and about I regularly hear the neighbors and passers by making mean comments about me as ""crazy person"" or disparaging comments about my face/body.  Sometimes people will pass me in the street or I will hear them making disparaging remarks as they pass my house all to do with how they perceived how deeply I must have catfished my wife. Wether I'm doing mundane thingsike taking out the trash or fun  things like going to the movies my life is about being hypersensitive to potential comments that community members might make of me when they notice me visually or audibly... For example one stranger who walked past us once whilst myself and my wife were out shopping said out loud ""well if he didn't catfish her she must have been really desperate"".  Other common remarks ""I hate hearing/seeing/meeting that guy""; "" I hate hearing him even when he's happy!""; ""I wish he would move"".  Sometimes I feel victimized by strangers when I perceive them to be laughing about me, and in those times it's like I'm reduced to high school where everyone laughs at you and you feel so small.

I used to be a smiley and a non judgmental person when I met my wife and before I moved to her country... but through this experience people either don't give me the chance to engage or are nice to my face and then make disparaging comments behind my back it's so hard for me to not get stressed about people I don't know.

As I said I got depressed as soon as I moved but the community has judged my depression and behaviour as validation for their remarks and judgements that my current delressed mental is the ""real me""  and that I was depressed and ugly all along that I hid it from my wife, that I long conned her. This is what fuels the community hatred of me.  They don't know that I was much happier before I immigrated...(I could move back to my home country but it's not an option because of finance).

Ive asked my wife many times: do you think I catfished you? Do you think I lied to you or made out thatI was something that I wasnt when we met online? Did i make out that I was better looking than I was? She has reassured me for all questons NO.  


I know I should listen to what my wife thinks more than the random strangers in my community but it gets to me...I have gotten into a pattern wherby I'll chew in the negative remarks, either getting sad it angry or both. Either way my life has become limited, Ive stopped going out to avoid being around othets and if course when you do that it doesn't help...


I know I should join a club or social group, but because everyone knows everyone in this small town city it's hard for me to go somewhere and feel like I'm starting with a blank canvas when I meet people. When I meet people I seem to decode  their behaviour as ""oh god not this guy, wish I didn't have to be stuck with him!"" I perceive that people just see me as the 'catfisher guy' and act guarded and defensive and even when they are being nice and civilised its I do the seem to detect sincerity I see the civilised behavior amas a way of saying GO AWAY! Like the difference between behind civilised and genuinely warm are two different things, I pick up on that and then I get disheartened... and then I become sad and guarded in response.


I try to kid myself that I don't need new people in my life as part of my recovery but I know that's a lie...I need people, but when you feel that people in your community already have a negative pre-judgment of you as a bad egg how do you deal with that?

So has anyone experienced similar feeling of being labeled (for whatever reason) and how that label can make engaging with people in your community difficult especially when you are judged as a bad person?

If you made it this far thanks for reading and I appreciate any advice or if you can't give advice just a cyber hug lol.",04May2020,1
102,"Okay, so this requires a little context. Me and my girlfriend have been dating for nearly a year now, and we're super close and have been through a lot together. We both admire and love each other lots and we are extra supportive and conscientious about each other's feelings. Naturally, we often have conversations about what would make the both of us the most happy and comfortable. Now, a few days ago, her abusive mother had been chewing her out for an hour about how she wasn't able to get some of her work done for a class in a time frame she thought was appropriate. My girlfriend told her that the amount of work she had been assigned had made her feel suicidal, which was justifiable because it was 100 questions on 10 assignments with a 70 question final at the end all in a week, her mother yelled at her, saying she was being dramatic.   


She came back sobbing in call and I told her to call the hotline because I didn't think I was equipped well enough to help with a self harm scare only a little while before. She ended up not calling because I was able to calm herself down enough to where she just needed some reassurance and assistance with things she needed. I was scared and one of my not great coping mechanisms is to fall asleep, I'm not sure if I knew that her mother was yelling at her or not when I passed out because it's kind of a haze. I woke up and she felt betrayed that I wasn't there for her then, and I told her that one of my coping mechanisms is to shut down and fall asleep, she said it was okay and that we could work on together how to combat against shutting down completely. I said okay and tried to move on from it. I later asked her about other people she could go to for when she is in distress and needs a backup because I shut down. She told me about one of our mutual friends that could help, but after all this I've felt intimidated to speak to her and anxious whenever I don't know what to say. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the irrational side of my brain still thinks that I am her only lifeline and I need to save her from herself. I've been in a friendship that was like that once before and it scares me, I know for a fact it's not healthy for either parties and I think I might be being dramatic. The thing is, is that, I don't know how to stop feeling so anxious! I just keep getting worse and worse as time goes by. I'm thinking about showing her this post to show her my feelings fully, without getting choked up by fear. I'm certain that this fear has only been brought on through trauma or something, but I don't know how to help. All I really know how to do is sleep.  


I don't know if I'm looking to vent or for advice, so comfort or guidance both would be appreciated! Thank you for reading.",04May2020,1
103,"My boyfriend's need to confess his bad thoughts/mistakes is ruining our relationship.

I love this man. I really do, its been nearly 2 years but his need to confess is unbearable and I can't stop him.

He seems to feel unbearably guilty unless he comes to me to see if I can forgive him? It's mostly memories and a lot of it is stuff he isnt even sure happened or if he made it up from overthinking.

104,"I need help understanding myself. I get the strangest mood swings in the world, sometimes something will make me happy, I’ll smile, and then as the smile wipes off of my face, I’ll realise that the moment of happiness is gone, and I’ll feel a feeling which I can’t describe, sort of like a sense of impending doom. I can’t sleep at night, I sit up all night, not because I want to stay up on my phone or anything, but because I hate the feeling of knowing that my time has ran out, and that once I get in bed, I won’t be able to communicate with anyone, and I’ll be alone. I’m so frightened of being alone, but last night I left all of the group chats with my friends because I get worried that I’m “burdening” them with my words- I can’t stop myself from spamming them with every detail of my life. I need to tell people about myself or what’s going on otherwise I feel completely alone. 
I’m extremely self-conscious about myself but sometimes I can except great amounts of comments, I go from “being the shit” to being embarrassed to be seen in public, for no reason. It’s like there are switches in my head and a monkey is in my brain just fucking around with them. My personality changes at a faster rate than I can even realise. 5 months ago I was so different that looking back I don’t imagine myself like that. I don’t want to bother the people around me, so I try to help everyone, but then things, make them smile, but then come 3am I’ll be sitting in the bathroom with my head in my hands.
I’m not using any labels for myself, because I don’t understand the labels, but sometimes I get so anxious, and 5 minutes later I’d be ballsy enough to offer out anyone that crosses me. The worst put down is when I’m doing well, when I’m succeeding I’ll tell my friends but they don’t seem to care at all, unless I’m entertaining them they seem like they want nothing to do with me, but other times I feel like I have the best, most caring friends in the world, I don’t know if it’s my own distorted perception of reality, or whether I’m just nitpicking.

105,"I get right now is extremely hard for everyone, please don't get me wrong, I know everyone is going through their own struggles. Two of my grandparents have passed within a week, I was so close with both of them so I am devastated. 

I cannot turn to my parents for support right now as they're both trying to come to terms with their own losses. The only person I really have is my best friend. I don't have a partner and I'm in lockdown alone. Apart from my family, she is the only other person who knew how close I was to my grandparents.

I don't know if I am being unfair. She doesn't have many close friends outside of our friendship and neither do I. I get talking to me right now is probably draining, but if she were going through the same, I would be there night or day. But the last week or so, I will send a message, she will reply, I will reply back and then she won't answer or take like 5 days to reply or she will message me first, I'll reply and she won't answer. I'm not even being depressing when I'm talking to her, I'm trying hard not to mention how I really feel and just chat about normal things, but I just need someone there, which usually she would have been. We normally talk everyday. Every single time I have spoken to her I've asked her how she is, how her family are, what she's been up to, whether she needs anything. I've literally mentioned their death once, and that is when it happened. Not since, even when she's asked how I'm feeling.

I don't know, I just feel sad as I thought she would 100% be there and I miss her. I feel sad about this on top of everything else.

106,"Hi there,

Put this up on my throwaway as my main account has a very distinguishable name. 

**Context** *(Question is just as the title asks)*
I had a break up not far off 2 years ago now. We were engaged, had been together for 8+ years, since we were 14 years old. The life I had wasn’t a life I was “settling for”, I loved what I had and considered myself the luckiest person in the world to have found it so early. 

Things changed suddenly and I was accused through the grapevine of cheating, with a new colleague. We broke up over the course of a long three month argument, lots of time has passed, I assume it is now known that no cheating happened etc. 

I have suffered heavily since the breakup with flashbacks, and a lot of large shifts in mentality that debilitate me temporary, and I have never been a person to take note of these sort of things. I see the entirety of a conversation that we had during the breakup, some more often than others, just seeing her crying, hearing the sadness in her voice like she was next to me. It just cripples me, I lose interest in where I am and who I’m with, I just turn and feel completely empty. I have never had any mental health problems before, so this is quite new to me and I’m just wondering if this is something that people could advise on. 

Thank you.",04May2020,1

108,"I've been struggling with anxiety for the past year or so. Most so these last 6 months. About 7-8 months ago I was put into a Director position for a tribal child welfare department. It's been a challenge, and I've had to push myself past what I ever thought I could do. Prior to this, I had only been with the department for a year as a case worker, and like 6 months as their office manager. Despite having no experience, they liked the work I did. While I was only in the director position for the interim, it was an awesome learning experience. We just got a new director on last month, and I've been training them since. 

The past few months have been hell though. Employees were starting to slack, I had to write people up, and the work just kept on piling. I didn't mind the work piling, because that's how I see my job security. I always have something to keep me busy, but with all the emotions and office squabbles. then having a new director on that's making big decisions before they have even learn the job. It's scared me a few times. 

Now I've always had anxiety. It was never bad, just always there. Just the way I was raised and everything has had it ingrained in me. The past 6 months have caused it to sky rocket thou. There were nights were I wasn't able to sleep, like tonight. While my blood pressure and heart rate were just fine, I could still hear my heart pounding in my chest whenever I laid down. No matter what I did I couldn't sleep. I'd lie there in the dark, then just feel myself ramping up until I'd have to sit up and turn on the light just to calm back down. Lately it's been getting worse. Something as simple as finding music to listen to frustrates the hell out of me because I can never find something that'd calm me down. Then adding on to a new event which should be a good thing, I found a new job in another city.  I leave at the end of the month.

I’m really just looking for advice here...

For some backstory last august 3 people broke into my house I live with my mum and stepdad one had an axe and one a golf club, ever since then I’ve had a lot of trouble sleeping I get no sleep on a Sunday (the day they broke in) and every night I can’t sleep till after 1;30 am (the time) I always keep my window open to try and hear anything and I’ll think I hear something and my heart will start pumping super hard and I can’t seem to relax, I have tried thinking about it logically but it was a targetted attack because my old brother who lives in another country and has for about 4 years was a pretty big time drug dealer so it was his old friends who know he doesn’t live there anymore that broke in

Since then last week I found out they got released from prison and I’ve barely got any sleep no matter the night, I live in Australia so getting a gun isn’t really an option haha

112,"So, I decided 4 days ago to stop smoking and take a t-break, at least (haven’t decided how much I want to cut back whenever I smoke again; need to talk it over with my psychiatrist). Usage prior to this was vaping at night before bed and whenever my girlfriend has work—I’m stuck at home all day and a bit of a high helps make this teeny apartment more livable. I’d say I was probably taking about 10 hits average per smoking session. 

Two weeks ago, I started a new antidepressant, Cymbalta. Currently at 60 mg daily (a.m.) and have been on it for 2 weeks. I also take Wellbutrin daily—300 mg. 

The past four days since stopping the smoking, a couple of notable things have happened that will be impossible for me to correlate to an absolute cause:

1. I definitely feel like my mood is improving. I haven’t been lethargic at all whereas prior to this every day getting out of bed was hard as hell, and I’d sleep for hours when the girlfriend was at work because I didn’t feel interested in doing anything. Today, I did laundry, went out to get beer, fixed our bed, did dishes, talked to mom for over 2 hours on the phone, and perused Reddit like a fiend. I partly worry that I’m experiencing hypomania, tbh. 

2. I’m experiencing insomnia. It’s 3 a.m. here and I’m not tired. I’m only on my phone because I’ve been trying to sleep for almost two hours with no luck. Last night, I did fall asleep around midnight but then I woke up at 4am and again at 8; both times, I was super wired. 

I know t-breaks can cause sleeplessness but apparently so can Cymbalta. I know weed can exacerbate depression for some people, so I’m wondering if my mood boost is because I stopped smoking or because the meds are kicking in (though the timing seems to convenient for it not to be the t-break; my mood was significantly better the day after I stopped smoking. 

Do I smoke a little to get to bed? Do I hold out hope that after a couple more days I’ll finally be tired? Because that’s the other thing, I’m not even tired. I’ve heard that Cymbalta-related insomnia can clear up eventually, if that’s all this is. 

Thoughts? Experiences?",04May2020,1
113,"19F here and I believe I have been struggling with mental health issues for quite some time now.

The things I did/do that make me believe so:

1. I'm a pathological liar, I make things up, I have even made up people. I lie about both things that matter and things that don't matter. Lying is natural to me. I think I do it for attention but I'm not sure. I definitely like to be the center of attention.

2. I catfish people, I've been doing so since I was 14. It started out as an innocent little game but now it's becoming very serious. My catfishing story is a long one so I won't talk about the details of it. The whole situation is making me super paranoid and anxious.

3. I don't think I've ever felt guilty for the things I've done. I never feel bad. I never think I did something wrong. The only time I'm angry at myself is if I mess something up and put myself in danger.

4. I steal money from my parents. I don't even remember how much I've stolen so far. I usually take 10-50€ at a time. I use it for buying clothes, makeup and stuff like that and also for going out. They still haven't noticed.

5. I have a really bad memory. I sometimes feel like a stranger to myself. I feel so empty. I don't know who I am. I am so many people at once but at the same time I'm no one. I try to build my personality and make it logically consistent. And I'm good at it because everyone believes me. Everyone believes the bullshit I serve them but deep down I don't think I care about anything in this world.

6. I think I'm hypersensitive in a way. I get offended and hurt very very easily but I hate to admit it and I almost never show it. I get really angry about little things. I hold grudges and I am vengeful. I've thought about destroying people's lives. I've even thought about killing someone but I was never serious about it because I thought it wouldn't be possible to get away with it. But if I could do it without anyone knowing I definitely would.

I went to a therapist for about a year in 2017 and 2018. I was diagnosed with depression. I honestly don't even remember if I was just faking it or not. I just know that I didn't talk about any of my actual problems with my therapist.

I don't know why I'm posting this. I don't know if I believe I can get better. Maybe I'm just curious. Anyways I've never talked about any of this to anyone. Ever. I have mentioned some parts of it in posts like this one but that's it.

I think the fact that not only did my dysphoria go away but I also experienced a major shift in my personality as a whole might indicate that I actually am trans and that something else was at play like my hyper fixations or a possible manic episode. This next part might sound weird but since I was in a religious environment growing up I was taught that when we die and our bodies are brought back to us, they return in their original state. That absolutely terrified me that I could potentially be stuck living as a female for eternity when I die. I’m always worried that moments like these are somehow proving that right. Although my dysphoria disappeared for only a few days is probably was the result of some mental illness, my OCD won’t let me live it down.

119,"Hi!  
I'd like to know what is happen to my girlfriend to understand if this is normal and, if it is not, how can I help her in a better way.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
Usually her bad moments happen without a reason one or two days per week and they last from a couple of hours to half of a day.  
Whey the bad moments start she changes from being communicative and involved to a condition where she becomes really lazy, she no longer communicates (or very little), she becomes very impatient and she no longer wants any physical contact (kisses or anything). She practically isolates herself from everything and sits alone using her smartphone or doing something else. Sometimes she has quasi-catatonic states where she starts to stare at something on the wall without blinking for a couple of minutes.   
When we talked about these reactions she says she doesn't know where they come from, she always had them and sometimes she cries because she knows she is hurting me.  
I don't know if this is related but often she is tired (as if she doesn't sleep well) and often she has bad nightmares and she is always worried that her loved ones can die.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
What it can be?   
I love her and I don't want to change her. I'm just trying to understand her better so I can help her the best as I can.  
When these moments happen, I try to be supportive speaking calmly with her, asking if she needs some time alone and when she agrees I try to find something else to do so I can give her some space (for 20-30 minutes). It's correct?",04May2020,1

*Radical shifts are needed to properly reposition mental health as something that is personally meaningful to everyone, not just the domain of ‘experts’ and people who are experiencing acute distress.* 

This might seem like a surprising proposition at a time when there is evidence of the success of mental health awareness campaigns everywhere you look — [Graeme Souness and Jamie Redknapp’s ‘powerful discussion’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=emb_logo&amp;v=xUlHqab3YZo) on mental health in football is not something I ever expected to see on Super Sunday. Even the royal family is getting involved, with [Prince William’s campaigning](https://www.headstogether.org.uk/) reflecting what seems to be a genuine passion for the subject matter. Corporates are also scrambling to demonstrate their commitment to promoting mental health and ‘wellness’, through ever-expanding employee assistance programs, the appointment of ‘mental health first aiders’, and the provision of lunchtime yoga sessions. Some pretty solid examples of how the reach of mental health awareness campaigns now extends to cultural spaces not typically associated with a progressive outlook and social responsibility.

Before going any further, it is important to say that I am wholeheartedly on board with the overarching objectives of campaigns such as [Time To Change](https://www.time-to-change.org.uk/) and [Mental Health Awareness Week (which starts on 18th May)](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/campaigns/mental-health-awareness-week) and the many others that have made a huge contribution to the growing interest in all things mental health. We should be extremely grateful to the organisations who have worked hard to promote the interests of the marginalised.

Whilst there is considerable cause for optimism, I believe that those with the biggest audiences are yet to capitalise on a golden opportunity to help dislodge stigma-perpetuating ideas from our collective conscience. At present, anti-stigma campaign groups tend to emphasise our collective responsibility to show sympathy and understanding to those affected by mental health issues. A noble cause, but we should be striving for a more radical shift: the repositioning of mental health as something that directly applies to all us in our personal quests for fulfillment and meaning, so that it is not solely the concern of those who are acutely distressed or ‘ill’. I get the impression is that this intuitively makes sense to most people, given that being human involves navigating impossible dilemmas, a near-constant struggle with bad habits, feeling the pain of losses, and finding relationships perpetually difficult. Labels or no labels, we all experience some level of psychological pain and suffering some of the time.

How a repositioning of mental health could dramatically benefit *everyone,* will hopefully become clear over the course this two-part blog, where I suggest that the following two issues need to become more central to conversations about mental health:

**Part 1 — The problematic use of psychiatric diagnosis**

Not only do diagnoses constitute dodgy science, but they also get in the way of our self-reflective capacity and our natural inclination to help other people to explore themselves. By not automatically deferring to psychiatric labels, we can create space for all of us to explore problems and dilemmas on a more personal and meaningful level.

**Part 2 — The unhelpful promotion of a binary view of mental health**

In other words, the idea that you’ve either got mental health problems or you don’t. Let’s face it, we’ve all struggled, are struggling or will struggle with the psychological turmoil that comes with being human. Is it, therefore, helpful (or logical) to say ‘1 in 4’ of us have mental health problems? What are the thresholds? What do messages like this imply about the ‘1 in 4’ and the other ‘3 in 4’? Is the ‘mentally ill’ vs ‘normal’ dichotomy working?

  
**Part 1. The problematic use of psychiatric diagnosis**

It has been seven years since The British Psychological Society released a [position statement on psychiatric diagnosis](https://www.bps.org.uk/sites/www.bps.org.uk/files/Member%20Networks/Divisions/DCP/Classification%20of%20behaviour%20and%20experience%20in%20relation%20to%20functional%20psychiatric%20diagnoses.pdf) highlighting it’s ‘significant conceptual and empirical limitations’. In short, the classification of mental ‘disorders’ (such as Depression, Schizophrenia and OCD) are supposed to be based on the ‘disease model’ of health used by the rest of medical science, but a century of attempts to find evidence of disease processes that consistently correspond with psychiatric classifications have largely failed. Whilst there are physiological markers that tally with specific behaviours, thoughts and emotions, these markers do not cluster in a way that supports the existing psychiatric classifications. Despite this, psychiatry has stuck by it’s system of what now must be seen as descriptions of problematic thoughts, feelings and behaviours, not illnesses or diseases. Most people intuitively get suspicious when they hear terms like ‘Internet Gaming Disorder’, and it’s the same pseudo-science underpinning more familiar ‘disorders’ which have come to mistakenly accept as evidence-based constructs. This stuff is not in the realm of anti-establishment conspiracy theories - even [the NHS agrees](https://www.nhs.uk/news/mental-health/news-analysis-controversial-mental-health-guide-dsm-5/) but has continued to use the system for want of another way of being able to categorise and treat ([despite the fact that there are viable alternatives](https://www.bps.org.uk/sites/bps.org.uk/files/Policy%20-%20Files/PTM%20Framework%20%28January%202018%29_0.pdf) emerging). 

Given that psychiatry is supposed to be part of medicine and medicine is supposed to be scientific, it is not unreasonable to expect a bit of hesitancy when it comes to the use of words like ‘illness’ and ‘disorder’ when describing psychological distress. Unfortunately, this has not been the case. No doubt a desire to offer people who are suffering, definitive explanations and solutions has played a big part in medicine’s reluctance to abandon a flawed system. A bit of [big pharma lobbying](https://medium.com/@brenoserson/big-pharma-fda-approvals-and-disease-mongering-82d63f1be8ce) might also have something to do with it but that’s for another day.

Please don’t misinterpret this as me minimising or denying the painful reality of psychological distress. As an NHS psychologist and as a person grappling with what it means to be a human being, I have seen and felt emotional pain as I am sure every person reading this has. I am also well aware that many people’s lives are dominated by mental health problems, and a diagnosis is the key to accessing support and resources. Getting rid of diagnosis does not mean getting rid of support for those who need it, but clearly this would need careful consideration in practice.

*The harm caused by psychiatric diagnosis*

The fact that we use scientifically flawed concepts to describe psychological problems is actually more of a footnote that sets the scene for a bigger problem: the role that diagnosis plays in the stigmatisation of people with mental health problems. Not only are most diagnoses not scientifically valid, they can also cause harm. Let me explain how:

Often these labels are internalised and become part of the person’s identity in a way that erodes their self-confidence and sense of agency. As a psychologist it can sometimes feel like you and the person in other chair are both fighting a losing battle: as you work together to deconstruct the unhelpful narratives that they too have come identify with (I’m an anxious person, a depressed person, a hyperactive person etc), external forces are constantly reinforcing these negative stories loaded with connotations of worthlessness and futility of trying to bring about change. The greater the extent to which someone has been defined by their ‘illness’, the harder it is for the person and the people around them, to see anything other than the label. Let me illustrate this with an example.

*The ‘Schizophrenic’ school teacher*

Take a ‘Paranoid Schizophrenic’. What comes to mind when you hear this term? And what if someone told you that your daughter’s school teacher was once given this diagnosis? The compassionate part of you is probably trying to make a case for being non-judgemental (you are after all a nice mental-health-blog-post-reading person), but I imagine there is another part of you connecting with the dominant stories that are told about ‘Schizophrenia’ and feeling uneasy about the possible risk posed by this potentially dangerous ‘Schizophrenic’. 

Conversely, if you were told your daughter’s teacher was raped when she was in her teens by someone she trusted, and in the two years that followed she was overwhelmed by suspicious thoughts about people’s intentions, you would probably view the same ‘Schizophrenic’ very differently. A story of an unpredictable and potentially dangerous person, becomes a story of hope and resilience - a woman gripped by fear has been able to overcome a horrific trauma. Her capacity to survive extreme adversity and determinedly rebuild her life, also gives some indication of the kind of strength and emotional intelligence that potentially have the makings of an excellent role model and teacher.

This hopefully illustrates what the dominant narratives associated with different labels can do: reduce a person and their story to set of negative stereotypes that lead to discrimination and the erosion of a person’s self-worth, particualarly if the person themself starts to believe these stories. This isn’t the most subtle example, but 

*Stifled curiosity*

I hope you are starting to see how the language of psychiatric diagnosis, has the potential to be a key perpetuating factor when it comes to stigma. Unfortunately, the language of psychiatry is so ingrained in our culture we often find it hard to talk about psychological distress without the use of this medical terminology. As well as obscuring personal stories, these terms hinder our natural curiosity and ability to make sense of our own or other peoples’ experiences in a meaningful way. “How is your OCD at the moment?” feels like a weird question because you are asking about something so abstract and decontextualised, that is probably not clear to anyone involved what is actually being asked about. It’s a conversational cul-de-sac that normally leads to someone describing a set of symptoms that the well meaning enquirer is then unsure of how to helpfully respond to. End result = ‘Probably best not talk about that again unless we really have to’. If takes away the label, you have experiences and behaviours that you can talk about in a more human way. Using the ‘OCD’ example a conversation between two friends might develop in a way that is more useful and exploratory.

A: How is the handwashing thing at the moment?

B: It's pretty bad actually.

A: How come? 

B: I’m not sure, but it tends to be worse when I’m stressed out. 

A: What are you stressed about?

In therapy, if someone comes to me with the baggage of labels, my first questions are normally along the lines of ‘what does ‘depression’ mean to you?’ and ‘how do you make sense of it?’. This normally jump-starts the person's natural curiosity that has been partially or completely suppressed by the idea that they have ‘a mental condition’. Questions like these often branch off into other questions until we are talking about relationships, hopes, fears and beliefs. Talking about ‘the depression’ becomes an increasingly absurd proposition as problems start to be understood as a part of a complex personal matrix of ideas that cannot be meaningfully reduced to a list of symptoms. 

*Back to stigma campaigns*

For many people, diagnosis and medicalised explanations are the only framework they have for making sense of their own suffering, so there is understandable wariness and in some cases hostility, from people who are attached to, and feel validated by, a diagnosis. Indeed for many it can be the one thing that makes them feel like their distress has been noticed. Whilst we must respect people’s freedom to label themselves however they please, mental health campaigners who have a large audience, also have a responsibility to (at the very least) say what their position is on this key issue. If an organisation continues to use language psychiatry without disclaimers, they are effectively reinforcing these potentially damaging ideas. Mind, It’s Time For Change, and Rethink have shown their willingness to engage with these issues by highlighting the controversy surrounding different diagnoses to some extent, which is a positive step. However, there is a strong case for going much further: Why not actively encourage people to think beyond labels we know are poorly constructed, and give people permission to be more curious about their own and each others’ idiosyncrasies? That is largely what good therapists do - be genuinely curious so that people have the chance to explore themselves. Which, incidentally, is what good friends also do. 

*Final thoughts*

As long as we go on deferring to labels as the default position thus discouraging our natural inclination to be curious, we will never reach the point where ordinary people feel like mental health is their domain, as opposed to the domain of experts. If you want to eradicate stigma, mental health needs to become something everyone has ownership of. When conversations about mental health become conversations about our personal philosophies and sharing ideas about how we navigate the impossible task of being a human being, we are starting to get somewhere. Encouraging people to be more sympathetic to a subset of people who are more acutely distressed has been the starting point, but I hope this is just the beginning.

In Part 2 (released later this week), I will be taking a look at the problem with the promotion of a binary view of mental health. In other words, the idea that you’ve either got mental health problems or you don’t. Let’s face it, we’ve all struggled, are struggling or will struggle with the painful reality of being human. Is it, therefore, helpful (or logical) to say that 1 in 4 of us have mental health problems?

124,"Hi everyone. I've never done this before, put my feelings out there for everybody to read. So here goes. 
I've been struggling with Anxiety/Depression for years. Never treated or really even properly diagnosed. I've always tried to ignore it and convince myself that I'm fine, it's just that I'm down sometimes and I'm anxious around people. However, it's recently become more than that. I find myself suicidal at moments and absolutely helpless. It's almost always about putting myself into new situations, meeting new people, but sometimes it comes out of nowhere and hits me like a wave. Now let me tell you, I have an amazing support system. My mom and dad are the most amazing people and the reason I am still alive today, I love them with everything I have. I have amazing siblings who I talk to on a regular basis, I have some friends who I will talk to here and there (none that I'm super close to) and my boyfriend...I can't even explain him to you. He makes me want to live, and he makes me feel so loved every single day. I should mention, I'm a 23 female, moved out with my boyfriend and we've been together for 3 years. 
   Anyways, even with all these amazing people around me my heart still hurts so much all the time. In my head I can say, I'm very lucky and I really shouldn't be this sad. However I just can't shake it. Part of the reason I am writing this is because I started a new job recently serving at the same restaurant that my boyfriend and friends do. I know...you're a server? Honestly, I'm not very good and I took the job because I needed to get out of my last job. It was very very toxic and I could make decent money serving. I took this job in one of my high moments, thinking that was what I was supposed to do in the moment. Working with my boyfriend has been nice, we don't ever fight and he is always there to help me. I also don't drive, simply because it scared the absolute shit out of me. I have my license, but immediately go into full panic mode when I sit behind the wheel, that is something I really wish to work on someday. The only downside to working with him is that I lean on him and my friends too much. If I'm too nervous to do something, he does it for me. I don't ever want him or my bosses to feel like I'm incapable of doing my job. Which, I guess when I write it down seems like that's what it is. It's just not the job for me. Every single time I get a new table and have to go up to them my heart starts racing and I feel like I'm going to just break down. I do it, obviously but it's absolute torture everytime.
   So, onto what is happening now. We are in a world pandemic, as I'm sure you all know who are reading this. I've been quarantined for about a month and a half, only working at the restaurant one day a week taking to-go orders. Not having to worry about my social anxiety, it's been nice if I'm being completely honest. I've been weirdly calm about this pandemic, while being very careful and taking the right precautions. However as I'm sat at home I can't help but feel like I shouldn't have to put myself through hell going to work every day and feeling like my world is ending. I've started drawing, painting, writing again. That is what I love to do. I also do special effects makeup and would love to peruse that as either a career or a form of art people can just admire through photos. That problem is, I have no idea how to do that. No idea how to go about making my passions into a sustainable living. I would love to try though. 
So as we speak I am writing this because I have called into work today, the first day the dining room would be open partially to the public and last night I had a full meltdown. I was panicking and my boyfriend just couldn't help, I wouldn't let him. I feel like when I have a panic attack like that I push every single good thing in my life away. All that was going through my head was, it would just be easier to die, or you aren't going to progress in life ever so what's the point?
I know that got really grim, I'm sorry. 
   I'm typing this because I'm uncertain of what to do next. I know I need help. I don't have any insurance so I'm not sure how to get some help. I've asked for help many times over the years, but then when nothing happens I hit a random high and try to convince myself that I can carry this baggage, when I know that my whole world will come crashing down once again. It always does. If you did read this whole thing, thank you and if you have some nice advice or encouraging words to give I would love to hear it. &lt;3",04May2020,1

127,"I feel like it's been years since I've felt uncomfortable in social environments but it wasn't always like that for me.

In my teen years, social anxiety was always keeping me from expressing myself. I've had it ever since I can remember and I'm curious is that the case with you guys/girls as well.

I'm doing research on the topic and would love to hear your history with this problem. And more importantly where are you at right now? Is social anxiety still an issue or more of a memory for you guys/girls?

I've pretty much dealt with it so any questions are welcomed :)",04May2020,1
128,"We are a group of researchers from the University of Bolton (UK). We are currently running an anonymous online survey on the use of online health information and virtual technologies (therapeutic websites/apps/games etc.) during COVID-19, for adolescents who experience anxiety.

We are interested in the extent and type of technology used by adolescents to help cope with anxiety during COVID-19, if your access to pre-lockdown support has been reduced, and how comfortable you feel using these technologies.

The survey is open to anyone who experiences anxiety and is aged between 10-19 years old, regardless of if you have a formal anxiety diagnosis or not.

The study is not sponsored by any organisation, and has been ethically approved by our university and the link to the survey is below. It takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete, and we would really appreciate your participation. 

Further information and contact details for the lead researcher are available on the first screen upon clicking the link.

Thank you for your time.

129,"I’m no stranger to mental illness, I have depression and generalized/sometimes severe anxiety. And it’s in the family. My mom has bipolar disorder (I’m not sure what kind) and I’ve seen what it does to a person and felt what it does to the people around them. 
I think I have symptoms of it, like highs and lows and random irritability. Also I get bursts of energy where I feel like I can do anything (well... write anything) 
This is the same stuff I saw with my mom. She would shop and buy impulsively and have these moments where she would be like “we can but the house and do this and that!” Similar time what I’m feeling. 

I would talk to my physiatrist but it’s really her doctor and I don’t connect with him well and he never listens to me. Not to mention we can’t get a meeting in at all because of the lockdown. 

I just don’t want to be like my mother. I really hope it’s my anxiety but it’s been going on for a while and I see the similarities. It’s scares me.",04May2020,1

So when I sent my prescription stating it was urgent they couldn't send it to me because apparently it wasn't on my repeat prescription. I had to call the GP and talk to them and they said if I send a photo of the box of pills via email then they will sort it out (because it says 20mg fluoxetine, 2 to be taken each day, with my name etc) I also told them I had one day's worth of pills left (sort of a lie I had only 1 pill left). Anyway I sent them the photo evidence via email, included my DOB and name.

Now it's been 6 days later and apparently they never received the email when I absolutely sent it. This also means I haven't taken any fluoxetine in 5 days and haven't taken my full dose in 7 days.

Me: “I am really concerned that if I am to wait such long times to see someone I am really going to detoriate.”
Referring to self harm, and suicidal thinking
School: “My duty of care is to support you and when safety is a concern I need to share this with others. From what I am hearing from you safety is a concern. I would like to talk to your mum, and would like to talk to you first. “ 

I don’t want people to know I am struggling mum knows parts but I don’t want her to know all of it.

I feel in my meeting tomorrow I am going to ask for confidentiality and beg for her not to ring as my safety is not a concern to me and if she thinks I am at risk of harming my self or others, where I live you can send the regional manager of mental health services an email asking for a test to be done on someone and I will suggest for her to do that in order to deal with the problems.

137,"I don’t like to post on Reddit often, but I don’t have anything else to turn to. I can’t talk about my body image on Facebook or any either social media site due to my friends and family. 

Here’s the rundown. I weight about two hundred pounds and I am 5’10. I have a stomach, but it can be concealed easily with big shirts and leggings. I haven’t been overweight my entire life, only after Sophomore year of high school did I gain most of it. Despite my efforts, I can’t keep a workout routine for my life and I hate eating healthy. I have a boyfriend that I have been dating for almost a year now and everything is great.. except our sex life. I am never in the mood anymore due to my insecurities and I eventually gave him permission to watch porn, only to keep him satisfied. It wasn’t a big deal until I noticed he watched a lot of skinny girls that always have perfect bodies. He swears that no matter what he watches, he still prefers how I look and that he loves my body. Tonight, I was in the mood for the first time in forever and I wasn’t able to make him finish. We talked afterwards and it took a lot of pushing, but he finally admitted that sometimes he wishes my body was like the girl’s he watched. I was the one who asked for the truth, but it still hurt really bad. I was finally getting comfortable with him seeing my body too, but now I just want to hide myself from everybody. Right now, I feel lost and very sad. I am already insecure and this is just going to make it worse. I know this is stupid and it’s a small thing, but I don’t know what to do to make him happy. My friends also say that I am perfect and blah, blah, blah.. but they’ve commented on my body before. So has my mom. I can’t even go swimming anymore because people will look at me and I don’t want them to see my body.

138,"I’ve been working on self improvement and personal growth ever since I was dumped 2/3 months ago, but since I’ve had a tough few days, I feel like everything has started to slide back the other way, and I need to stop this regression and keep improving. There’s a lot of things in life I have struggled with, I have a long term health condition (cystic fibrosis) which increases my anxiety, particularly with potential girlfriends, even though I’m looking after myself and touch wood keeping in good condition. I get really bad performance anxiety during sex to the point where I just can’t stay hard and my heart races and I just panic. I find approaching girls (sometimes even other guys I could possibly be friends with) difficult, because my mind goes blank with things to talk about and I feel like I’ll be perceived as creepy. I’ve always been very conflict avoidant and a people pleaser because I feel like if I bring up my true opinions everyone will screw me over, but I did the other day cut off quite a few friends who I found were chatting shit behind my back and being very two faced which was a good step. I was abused as a child by my stepdad and hid it from my mum for 8 years both physically and emotionally (that has been dealt with). I have a problem with social media, I feel like I compare my life to everyone else, like everyone has expectations for me. I delete my tweets if they don’t get enough likes, try too hard to interact with people, then people view me as desperate and stuff like that. I feel very lonely at the moment, especially considering I have only my 1 close friend and when they are working/busy then I have nobody. I decided to take a social media break for a while, and started treatment for anxiety but this has been put back due to the pandemic. I did learn guitar and have gotten pretty good with it, but again that doesn’t help the fact I feel inferior and don’t have a good self worth. I’ve let people walk all over me my whole life. The people who know me won’t know this side of me, they think I’m a funny caring friendly guy and they’re shocked when I tell them this.

140,"I'm in a pretty unstable state right now so sorry if it seems chaotic to read.

I just feel so worthless and inadequate and invalid. 

I want to give care and love to someone that I hold very dear to my heart, but I couldn't. I just feel so depressed I hardly have any enjoyment doing stuff I love. All my support systems right now are basically unavailable. I don't to cause too much strain on him because I'm afraid I'm going to make it worse for the both of us. 

I don't know it's just... I don't want him to feel even worse than before yet I let that chance slip just because I'm feeling shit myself. I fucking love him yet I couldn't do anything. I literally have some advice and healthy coping ways but my brain decided to ignore all of that.

I'm scared. I feel so uncomfortable. I know that I'm not perfect and that troubles me a lot. 

I'm hypocritical a lot of the time and it pains me.

I hate the concept of time. If I don't have anything done then I just sit there, with a heavy anxious feeling suffocating me. It's simple homework for fucks sake yet I'm feel so hurt that I just don't want to do it.

My brain doesn't want to improve itself from all the mistreatment I had ever since I was a kid. 

I think I'm hard to love, not empathetic enough, not caring enough to give someone love, extremely aggressive on others, even though I don't want to cause harm to others. That's how people can force me into doing things, they never do it in a kind way, always doing it aggressively. 

Yet he loves me so much, and I love him too. A lot. I feel so powerless... I don't know how to handle this. I feel out of touch with reality. Knowing all my flaws is like a nightmare for me. 

I still have trust issues even though he is very trustworthy and has proved that all the time. I basically act cautious around certain things with everyone. I could LITERALLY talk about anything that troubles me yet I'm hiding everything because I'm afraid of getting hurt.

A big deep-rooted fear of mine is being criticized. I'm well aware that it's normal and sometimes even necessary, but every time I hear a smidge about a flaw of mine, I almost start crying. I feel extremely unworthy of anyone's time just because my brain interprets that small flaw as ""There is something extremely wrong with you and you should be ashamed"" type of thing.

142,"I'm writing this on a throw away because for privacy reasons, although I don't think any of the people I know actually use Reddit

Just some context: I used to have a big friend group, or people I at least thought that were my friends. I'm (15M) a sophomore in high school and growing up i never really had much friends until my freshman year. It felt good to finally have some people I can call my friends. Throughout middle school I was dealing with a lot of family issues at home (things I won't go into because it would be too long to explain) but it really affected me a lot. At school I didn't talk to anyone or have any friends for 2 years. Throughout middle school it was a really bad experience for me, even before then I never really had much friends.

Long story short, about 6 months ago I got involved into some things I probably shouldn't have done. I ended up getting suspended from school for a week, had to go to drug and alcohol classes, and I also had to go to court. These were very hard times for me and I realized that all the people that I considered to be my friends weren't there for me. All the people that I needed to be there for me, weren't there for me. I felt very alone, because at that moment I was alone. It made me reflect back on how alone I always was throughout my life. From that moment on I decided to cut off everyone, I went from having a large friend group to only having 1-2 friends. I felt like I kept the only people that were good for me in my life. 

As a result, I made some big changes in my life that I believe were good for me. I started exercising and getting in shape, I started trying in school again and getting straight A's, I felt happy for that time. I felt like I only had the people in my life that I needed. I had my neighbor who I would consider my best friend, and she really had a positive impact on my life ever since I met her. She's the one that in a way inspired me to workout and start trying in school again.  I even met some new people that I thought were pretty cool. I understood them, and they understood me. Everything seemed to be going fine until the pandemic started. 

I'm unsure why I'm like this, but there's times where I wish to be alone. Maybe it's because I was always used to being alone, or I'm just a strange person. I block everyone out for a short period of time (maybe a week or so). I don't reply to text, I leave people on opened/delivered and I just back away from any social media for a moment. It's like sometimes I don't have the energy in me to be social. I like being alone sometimes and I really enjoy it. I've learned i'm a very introverted and awkward person but I like who I am. Ever since the pandemic started and I've been at home all day, this has affected some relations with some people who I considered to be my friends. Not sure why, but they might have thought that I was ghosting them or not replying to their text because I had something against them? or didn't want to be their friend? and as a result they did the same. I've been left on delivered for about 2 weeks now and still no reply from anyone, not even the group chat.

My neighbor (Who I considered to be my best friend) before the pandemic we used to hangout almost everyday and go on long walks and talk about things etc. Now that we can't really see each other we text sometimes. She's really the only person I talk to at this point. Even then we don't really text much. I feel like we've talked about so much at this point, I'm unsure of what to talk about. So I just text her asking how she's doing and if everything is okay. I feel like i'm just repeating the same thing over and over again and it gets boring. At times I feel like a nuisance. No one texts me and asks me how i'm doing. When I text people I'm usually the one to start the conversation. At this point I really only text about 1 person a week. 

I've been really thinking a lot about my current situation recently, and there's times where I just want to cut everyone off completely. I want to do my own thing and find people who actually understand me and that I can talk to, but with everything going on I don't think that would be possible. 

I just feel very alone, I've cut people off and people cut me off. I don't have anyone to talk to and it gets depressing at times when i'm stuck at home by myself with nothing to do other than to play video games and watch Netflix. I just want someone to talk to that understands me. I just want people in my life that support me, and that care for me like I care for them. I want someone that I can share my experiences with and we could talk about interesting topics.  I just want a real friend.

 I'm not really sure why i'm posting this on Reddit. Maybe at least someone will read it. I don't have anyone to talk to so why no here.",04May2020,1

he got real banged up in the incident and now he has blamed me for the past few days. he says if i wouldn’t have stopped in the 4 way in the first place to try to make a point about the seatbelt, none of it would have happened. while that may be true i told him not to get out of the car and fight him in the first place. 

he won’t let me touch him and he’s hardly talking to me. he said he may even want to break up. i’m not sure what to do at this point because he is so upset over the entire situation. he feels like he failed. he thinks he needs to get revenge. 

my question is what can i do to help him get through this? is this entirely my fault? he hasn’t eaten since it happened, doesn’t get on his phone or leave the house, and i catch him staring off into space just not saying anything. i don’t know what to do. when he looks at me he sees what i caused and he has this look of in his eyes and i’m unsure what to do. we’ve been dating nearly four years and i’ve never seen him like this.",04May2020,1

Can someone help understand this?or give me advice on what to do? 

Note: we I don’t really know him other he follows my on my Instagram and he’s older then me. Also a quick trigger warning for the following; suicide, suicidal thoughts, body dysmorphia, bullying

So today I’m struggling with low self esteem and my body dysmorphia, panic attacks and anxiety are really bad for the past few days. I made a quick post about about feeling awful in my Instagram story and this guy comment on my story saying to “Cheer up”. I ask how is asking to cheer up to make my low self esteem go away and he mentioned that “You’re better that your self esteem”; I understand that he may be trying to help me feel better, but the rest on the conversation we had, just made me feel awful. 

The rest of the conversation he ask when made feel like this, I mentioned that I had people told me how I was good enough and the issue that I have mention, suddenly he mentioned how get got bullied for his race in catholic school and was disowned by his family disowned him when he moved out. I apologise that he had go through that and I must have been hard for him, he continued more about his upbringing about being then he mentioned why he should exist and also mentioned that an old coworker try to give him pills to “help him dead quicker”. I got panicky ask if I should call the police because I didn’t know if he was endanger or not (he didn’t mention that is was years ago after I mentioned about calling the police as I thought it was recently). He told me not to and said he’s only done it twice (I think it’s just me and I might be too sensitive, but I don’t understand why you would tell a stranger about his upbringing. I would understand if I’d ask him to give me his life story, but I didn’t) he continues with his life story and also mentions about his financial issue his having and ask me if that was fair. I told him she really should to a lawyer about that and I don’t have any experience with that. He then say “I think I’m going to say is sorry I messaged you, but I’ll try to deal with it.” And told me to don’t worry about it.

148,"I’ve been inside my home since 15th March. I’m studying at another state, and it’s really difficult to come home you know, the flight tickets are not cheap, the buses I’ll have to take to reach my house because it’s at rural areas, and only two weeks of holiday after every 6-month long semester. 

I was supposed to be back by early April, but the University made a notice that we’ll have our holidays extended until the end of June. My session should be ended by March next year, but I don’t know if we’re going to make it now. There’s so much uncertainty, it’s messing with my head for a long time now.

Ever since I decided to move out from the hostel that the University provided because I was paired with bunch of dudes who takes the Music course, they’re jamming every night, I already have to deal with my anxiety that haunts me every night if I stay up late, I just want to sleep peacefully, hence I moved out.

I moved out to a house, wishing things would be better. At first, it was fine, we were all getting along well. We have 8 persons living in that house including me, and I thought things will be fine until the end of university life. 3 months back, there was a fight between 3 guys, probably over hygiene problems. They’re coursemates, so they took the master room, with a bathroom. I’ve never been in there that much, so I didn’t know what’s the deal.

After the fight happened, 2 of them rarely be at home anymore. They either go hangout at their senior’s home, or they would’ve stayed at the library. I don’t know what’s the deal between them, I don’t want to get involved, I don’t care because I have my own shits to deal with.

Time passed quick, it’s time to pay rent. We all have to individually transfer the rent to the account of the landlord. But that’s not the case anymore. The landlord decided to come to the house while I was all alone, he did a spotcheck on everywhere, he found tons of cigarette butts in the master room, he thought that he should pick someone to take care of the house for them, and as the only person he saw at that time, he demanded me to be in charge of the house.

I am not a leader type of person. I don’t want and will never want to lead shits. I know myself well enough that I will want everything according to my steps, and if anyone fucks up, I will lose my shit. I tried to contain myself at first. But pay-the-rent day has arrived again, like always I transferred my rent to the landlord’s account, but 2 of the guys didn’t. The landlord decided to ask me why, which I have zero idea of, ever since they decided to stay outside more than they do at home, I’ve never spoken anything to them, because we don’t meet that often.

Landlord says that it is my job to collect the rent and give it to him by the 7th every month, a job I never said I wanted to take. Guess it doesn’t matter now. I texted them, they told me that their parents will transfer their monthly expenses by the next day. So I told the landlord, and obviously, they didn’t pay, at all. I had to bust out my own money that I got for my salary for working my ass of during the holidays when I wasn’t able to go home because the flight tickets are way too expensive.

Months after months, sometimes they pay me back, most of the time they don’t. My savings are getting lesser and lesser, and the landlord is pushing me harder and harder. The landlord doesn’t want to be the bad guy for keep asking them over and over again when they are going to pay, so he decided to push me on board. And now, he eventually thinks that I’m his lamb because if by 7th I don’t pay him, he’s gonna keep calling me and bother me instead of them. Why am I always the one to take the fall for someone else?

Sometimes I will have to cut down my own expenses, so that I can help them pay. Sometimes I will have to starve for 3 days straight, because I only have enough money to eat during the excercise day. Sometimes I will have to push them, just to find out that they actually already have the money but they didn’t want to give me because they’re sure that I will help them pay. If I push some more, they’ll get annoyed and ask me to stop pushing them because I’m making them depressed that way.

My mental health is getting worse everyday. I don’t feel like talking to anyone in the house, I don’t want to tell my parents about it, because I know they’re gonna help me out, but I don’t want them to worry about me. I only vent with my close friends, been friends ever since we were 6 years old. Some of them has been helping me emotionally, some financially. I am glad to have them, they’re the only good things God have granted me with besides from my family. 

I’ve been hoping to go back town ever since. Meeting with them are the only thing that kept me going. I’ve only worked part-time during holidays, but I worked part-time during school days in early March because I wanted to earn enough to buy myself a flight ticket and it was really hard to catch up with my grades but I managed to pull that off and got 3.5 for my final result of fifth semester. Then we’re given a holiday of 2 weeks. 

I flew back to town by 14th March. I have 5 really close friends, 2 of them are also studying across the state and were also going to come back to town by 21st, and 3 of them have always been in town after graduate. We planned to hang out and go for a little trip around the town when everyone’s back. We’re all happy and excited about that, and I’ve never been so happy since I got myself in those mess. Everyone was talking about the trip, about where we should visit, what hotel should we book, whose car should we drive, and what activities we can do in the group chat. 

My country has locked down, due to the virus, by 18th March. They’re not allowed to fly back anymore, they’re not allowed to go out anymore. We never get to see each other, not even once since I got back to town. They cancelled the flight, they’re not coming back for now. The trip is dismissed, we’re not going anywhere anymore. By the time my country lifts the lockdown, I guess it’s time for me to go back to the shithole that I was trying so hard to get away from.

I tried so hard to hold all these emotions back, I’m starting to lose my shits. I cried when I was eating dinner with my parents, they had no idea of what happened to me, but they decided to just let me cry. After I was calmed for a little bit, they asked questions and questions, I told them almost everything how I worked hard for all this, except anything about the house. The tension I have on me is unmeasureable, it hurts me a lot, I want an escape, I want to kill myself, but I don’t want to upset my family and friends, and that’s the only reason that keep me going.

I need to get this off my chest. I know I can’t keep relying on my friends just because they’re nice. I don’t want them to feel that I’m trying to take advantages from them, I don’t want to lose another reason that keeps me alive. So I decided to post here, sorry for wasting your time.",04May2020,1
149,"So I know I’ll get ripped for attempting to tease out a diagnosis, on my own, but I have no other options. 

I’ve read over the DSM description for PPD and my wife fits it perfectly, IMO. She has been getting worse over the last 4years and recently left me. She moved back in with her parents a few months ago, cutting contact with me. (Her paranoias eventually involved me). 

Her doctor will not talk to me because I don’t have permission from my wife. Her parents are just completely uninvolved and know even less than I do. What I do know is that my wife said something to her psychiatrist that got her prescribed low dose Haldol. What I don’t know is if she’s taking it or not. She told me it was for her anxiety, which I immediately doubted after looking it up...

I read that Haldol is prescribed for many different psychotic illnesses, so I assume the doctor must have also noticed something similar to what I’ve noticed. 

She HAS been previously diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. My thoughts are that her PTSD morphed into PPD. 

So my question is, what am I up against? Is there light at the end of this tunnel? If she decides to start talking to me again, what should I say to her to help her? What kinds of treatment could help her? Can PPD go away? Can it lead to other things?",04May2020,1
150,"Me 26f, got dumped last weekend by 28m and I just don’t get it. This might end up being long story but I’ll try to make it as short as I can.

We met two months ago and we really had some special connection. He opened up to me about things he said he’d never told anyone. Suicidal thoughts, feeling of being completely worthless. His background is very hard and the depression has been there for at least 5 years. Tried to get help but recently didn’t have any and is trying atm to find a good psychologist.

About three weeks ago it went very bad and he started to be very distant. Sometimes he said he loves me, another days he wasn’t sure. Then he said he doesn’t have the resources to have me in his life. He took some days to think about it all and after that ended up leaving me. He said it’s for my best and his life is not supposed to be happy. He said he would break me. I told him he is running away from the good things that happen to him and that he shouldn’t even know the feelings precisely after just two months of knowing each other.

I feel like he gave up very easily. I really would’ve been a good choice for him (stable, good job, education etc.). Of course these things don’t matter if he just doesn’t feel it. But because the issues, I doubt that it’s just because of the feelings weren’t there. I even sent him a letter trying to make him understand that I really wanted this. 

I try to follow all the normal breakup advices, like no contact etc. but I’m also very worried about him and I’m not sure he made the right decision. What do you guys think, is it just better to leave him alone? I mean I know I have to respect his decision and maybe it can be too overwhelming if I keep contacting him but on the other hand I don’t like that he feels so worthless. The last thing he told me is to forget him.

151,"Last week I started noticing the smell of cigarettes entering my living from the corner. Turned out that the only possible explanation is a leak in the ventilation that runs past it. 

So I told the people that run the building and they told maintenance and now I just have to wait....

But every fucking time I get that smell in my living room I get so fucking frustrated because I cant do anything about it and am basically not comfortable in my own living room until that smell is gone, and it takes atleast 10-15 minutes before its gone. 

If I could do anything I would but this all comes down to how quickly maintenance calls and how long it takes before they can actually show up. 

Being chased out of my living room by this fucking smell is putting an enormous damp on my mood which is already affected by the whole covid shit to the point I can see myself breaking down in anger and frustration. 

I dont have a large appartment so the only place I can to to is my bedroom, but I really dont want to be stuck in my bedroom everytime someone decides to smoke....the only thing I can think off is putting a hole in the ventilation casing so that the smell goes out somewhere else than my living room. I've already checked for holes, found one and plugged it but it just shows up somewhere else where I cant see anything....

153,"TW/CW: Talk of suicide, murder, and other grisly topics

I'm in the USA. I'm not looking for a diagnosis here...just ideas.

At the risk of sounding like a hipster, I feel like I'm not like most other people. Emotions have always been weird for me. On one hand, I'm very sensitive and experience some sort of emotional response to just about everything. But I always feel disconnected from them somehow, and don't really truly feel them. I currently have moderate major depressive order, which kind of explains it now. But I've always been this way, even before I was depressed. It's rare for my emotions to fully consume me, if that makes sense. I mostly just feel what I would describe as ""gray"" or ""bleak"". Not happy or unhappy necessarily, just...blah, I guess. Neutral. I can tell when I'm having an emotional response to something, but it's like it's a distant part of me that I'm not really communicating with.

On the other hand, on the rare occasions that I DO feel them in their entirety, it is absolutely profound. Every time it happens it feels like I've never experienced an emotion anywhere near as strongly as I'm currently experiencing it in that moment. The sheer beauty of it, even when it's a negative emotion like sadness, is overwhelming to me and I feel truly alive. Sometimes, just the fact that I'm feeling that particular emotion so intensely is enough to make me weep on its own.

What gives?

On a related note, there's another thing that I've observed about myself that I consider to be quite unusual when compared to most other people. Content that most people find deeply disturbing, such as videos of suicides, murders, or just other humans suffering in some way doesn't really affect me. It usually doesn't elicit an emotional response from me at all, but when it does, it barely even registers. Mostly, I'm just morbidly fascinated by it. I'll watch the same video of someone killing themselves several times just to observe and pick apart each and every gruesome detail in full. This often leads me down the rabbit hole, and I'll wind up seeking out more of this content for a few hours until I feel like I'm ready to stop. I don't necessarily enjoy it, mind you. But I also can't stop, nor do I want to. I just have to watch it...I'm drawn to it. The weird part is that this only applies to videos of humans being harmed. If it's any other species of animal being harmed, I find it deeply disturbing and can barely stand to watch it. My heart races and I become really upset from it. But humans? No problem. I feel nothing for the person being harmed.

I've never tried to figure out a reason for any of this. All I know is that I was never like the other kids at school growing up, and even now as an adult, the emotional responses people have to various situations continues to perplex me.",04May2020,1

It probably goes without saying but I was an addict very young developing an extreme alcohol problem where I shoplifted it daily for about 3 years. I huffed air duster, popped pills, did anything to feel different. Later on I got into cocaine and used that with THC concentrate to sort of simulate a speedball.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been experiencing panic attacks a lot in the past 3 months. I'd say they're work-related, I stress a lot about it. I deal with lazy, rude coworkers; I have to pick up after them and get the blame when my area is slacking. (Time to get a new job) .

My first panic attack was at work, I was casually walking, and then, out of nowhere, bam, I was struck with intense anxiety, became extremely conscious regarding my **heartbeat** (you know the drill), and sat out the back.

It has not disappeared since and is starting to ''**paralyze**'' me in terms of doing regular activities. I will occasionally feel like I have no control over my limbs / ''fake'' numbness, **which causes me to think I'm having a stroke**. I have to assure myself that I am not by either holding onto something tightly, (considering purchasing a weighted blanket)  OR run my hands under hot water in order to regain control I guess you could say. Hot water bottles help me a lot at night.

It's even starting to affect my vision (I think?) as my vision will occasionally blackout for a split second at stressful times. (Covid is not helping).

&amp;#x200B;

**How does this relate to eating in any way?**

**I'll explain;**

Now that I've been cursed with this  '**'never-ending-like panic attack**'', it has started to make me become VERY conscious of my heartrate/blood sugar, etc. I'm extremely cautious of what I consume, I can't even go as far as drinking a simple coffee/tea. 

Nor can I eat simple snacks such as; chocolate, chips, milk, yogurt, meat, you name it, as I'm in constant fear that it will potentially kill me. Illogicial, I know, I can't seem to break out of this cycle though.

Is this generalized anxiety/panic disorder? Or do you think that it has developed into an eating disorder too?

I'm wanting to go to CBT.

167,"Coping with depression is no easy task. The mood disorder is characterized by feelings of hopelessness, emptiness, loneliness, and excessive guilt for extended periods of time. Individuals with major depressive disorder will experience episodes lasting at least two weeks. Individuals with persistent depressive disorder experience episodes lasting significantly longer—more than two years in adults and more than one year in children and adolescents.

The symptoms of depression extend beyond low mood. Patients may also have a lack of motivation, find it difficult to concentrate, be unable to anticipate feelings of fulfillment or happiness, and may have recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. Depression can also bring on feelings of fatigue and may alter sleeping and eating habits. Taken together, these symptoms can disrupt patients’ social lives and careers.

Depression is distinct from sadness or bereavement caused by a major life event such as the death of a loved one—though those who are prone to depressive disorders may experience a depressive episode because of such an event. For those with major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder (also known as dysthymia), depressive episodes are not always tied to a specific event and may seem to arise for no discernible reason. However, when one is experiencing a depressive episode, one may begin to view the world through a depressive schema.

Such a schema is not merely an analog to the medieval melancholic or the eternal pessimist who sees the proverbial glass as always ""half empty."" There may be neurobiological evidence to support what many individuals who have struggled with depression have experienced. It may also support the claim of [Aaron Beck](http://cognitivetherapynyc.com/docs/arosnonintro.pdf), the father of cognitive therapy, who proposed that depression could be described as a cognitive disorder wherein negative information is given a higher priority than positive or neutral information.

## What Causes Depression?

Despite being one of the most widespread forms of psychiatric pathology, the simple answer is that researchers are not certain. As noted above, some depressive episodes may be triggered by trauma, but other factors—including one’s neurochemistry, one’s neural architecture, and how well one’s brain responds to stress—can have an impact on how susceptible an individual is to depression.

While it is clear that genetics play a key role in determining one’s risk of developing depression, there does not appear to be a single neurobiological cause. Researchers have identified more than 100 genes and their alleles that can affect an individual’s neurochemistry, neural architecture, or ability to effectively process stress. This has led to multiple theories to explain the onset of depressive episodes and the reason why some individuals are more prone to them than others.

The latter may seem surprising, since stress is not typically associated with depression. However, excessive stress or the body’s response to perceived stress appears to play a crucial role in the development of depression and may even alter neural architecture. Stress can affect specific regions of the brain, particularly the limbic system (which includes the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus), and may lead to physical changes in brain structure, including impaired nerve growth.

A [study](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/19/12/5034.short) published in the *Journal of Neuroscience* found that the hippocampus was between 9 percent and 13 percent smaller in depressed women when compared to women who did not suffer from depression. Furthermore, the difference in hippocampus volume was more pronounced among women who had experienced more depressive episodes throughout their lifetimes, suggesting a correlation between the number of depressive episodes and hippocampus volume. Other [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10889528) have proposed that impaired neurogenesis in or an underdevelopment of the hippocampus is not a consequence of depression, but rather its antecedent.

## Negative Memory Storage and the Hippocampus

The hippocampus plays a central role in recollection and the encoding of episodic memories. Episodic memories are believed to be stored in clusters of neurons known as [engrams](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10683-2), and individual engrams are believed to be associated with individual memory traces. Specific engrams corresponding to individual pieces of information, researchers have found, can be tagged using Ca2+ imaging. Consequently, one can observe a pattern that corresponds with memory creation, memory processing, and memory retrieval.

The hippocampus also plays a role in processing negative or stressful information, which suggests that it could be possible to test the cognitive theory of depression proposed by Beck in a lab. Using murine models, researchers at the Douglas Hospital Research Centre at McGill University in Montreal recently did just that.

The experiment utilized the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model to observe engrams in the hippocampi of mice believed to be susceptible to stress and a separate group believed to be resilient. The team hypothesized that susceptible animals would have a hippocampus that is more sensitive to stress, that these animals would have more hippocampal engram cells related to stress, and that depressive behavior would be observed by reactivating the engram cells corresponding with stressful experiences. Resilient animals, they reasoned, would not have an increase in hippocampal engram cells related to stress.

The team, Zhang et al, [published their findings](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2019/08/12/JNEUROSCI.1958-18.2019) in the *Journal of Neuroscience* in August. They discovered that,

&gt;“Compared to resilient or non-stressed control mice, susceptible mice exhibited a higher reactivation of social defeat-related… engram cells… in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampal CA1 regions. The density of CA1 engram cells correlated with the level of social avoidance... Our findings that negative memory engrams are increased in mice that are susceptible to CSDS suggested that these engrams could mechanistically contribute to the negative bias of memory formation in depression.”

In other words, mice that retained more negative information were more likely to revisit the negative memory and behave in a depressed manner, whereas mice that retained less negative information were less likely to revisit the memory and behave in a depressed manner.

While this major study may not answer our questions about the direction of causality between negative memory bias and depression, it does indicate that the hippocampus does play a significant role in reinforcing depressive behaviors. It also does give greater credence to Beck’s contention that depression can be viewed as a cognitive disorder, though it does not necessarily negate any theoretical paradigm about depression. Consequently, the team concluded their paper on an optimistic note about what this study could mean for patients: “Inhibiting negative memory engrams in the hippocampus could be a novel therapeutic approach for treating cognitive symptoms in depression.”

More studies are needed to confirm these results and to explore how negative memory engrams could be successfully inhibited, but this could potentially be a step in providing new forms of treatment for one of the most widespread and debilitating mental illnesses in the world. These novel approaches may also allow us to better understand the complex web of biological and psychological components that are the underlying causes of depression and take more proactive steps to prevent it.",04May2020,1

172,"I don’t know why this is happening, and I feel so alone.  I’m sorry this is so long. I didn’t really know where to post. 

Backstory: I (28F) am college educated. I grew up with narcissistic, critical, controlling/manipulative parents. I suffer from Major Depressive episodes, generalized anxiety, OCD, and was diagnosed with Tourette’s Syndrome as a child. I have always been a black sheep—never fit in. I studied psychology because I always felt so fucked up, and like it might teach me something about myself. As you might guess, a BA in psychology is useless. I don’t have a career. I don’t even know what I want. 

My bf (28M) was a friend in college. He has a double BA— electrical engineering and physics. He is in his 5th year of his EE PhD. He is incredibly smart, and I love him to pieces. He’s also studying how to make LEDs more energy efficient; he will do real good for the world. 

For years, I wanted to be a therapist—potentially with a focus on sex or sex education. I have what I feel is too much empathy. I cry at the dumbest stuff, and feel others’ pain deeply. I was also good at psych—found it easy and intuitive. 3 years ago, I developed a best friendship with a guy; I did not realize until last summer that he was a narcissist like my parents. He told me I lacked empathy and would be a terrible therapist. I believed him. I also didn’t have another plan. 

Now to the point: I am generally an enormous fan of education; I doubt I’d be dating a PhD candidate if I wasn’t. But ...I feel like I’ve been trying to figure out what I want for a decade, and am still at a loss. Everyone is urging me to go back to school, but I already feel like my psych degree was a fucking waste—why would i go get ANOTHER?! I know the opportunities for someone with a Masters are different, but if the BA felt like a mistake, deep down, I question why a MA would *really* be different. But I also don’t really feel I have any alternatives I’d like, or that would be remotely lucrative. I’m sure a PhD in sociology or women’s studies would be fun, or but wtf kind of career does that set me up for? I don’t want to be a professor. 

Lately, I get incredibly angry when I hear experts discussing their field of study. I feel juvenile for this. I suppose I am jealous that they not only knew what they wanted, but were smart and successful enough to get it. I don’t feel good enough—ever. My boyfriend will put on a podcast with some scientist, theoretical physicist, mathematician, and I just get so mad. This is new since quarantine—this was never a problem before. I have to leave the room. He put on what anyone else would see as a feel-good video, but the host talking with someone about to graduate from Harvard set me off and I had to go downstairs and cry.  (For the record, my older brother went to Yale, and there hasn’t been a moment in my life when I didn’t feel inferior to him. He also just happened to fall into a career he loves, at a top organization, with very high pay.) I have had jobs in mental health, social services, animal care, customer service and office administration to no avail. 

Right now, becoming a therapist feels like a terrible idea. I can’t even control my emotions listening to a fucking podcast; how could I stay neutral while talking to a narcissist?! My uncle was a medical doctor, who regretted his career his entire life. I am terrified of doing the same. But I also feel like I have no good options where I am now. My parents pressuring me has not helped.  

I guess I’d like to know if anyone has suggestions for how to cope with this anger? I honestly feel guilty—like some backwards person who is jealous of knowledgeable people. For the record, yes, I’m in therapy, and have been for over a decade. Believe it or not, I am mentally healthier than I was at 22. But I am so stuck now. I guess if someone has some perspective, I’d love to hear it. If you actually read this...thank you.

Getting a job has been very easy and successful for me, but keeping it is the hard part. I’ve been hired multiple times, go in on my first day and have a panic attack and quit on the spot. 

My mother is really stressing me to get a job without letting me see my therapist first. I can’t keep a full time job, I just can’t do it.

176,"Long story short he’s a toxic person obviously. I turned off the light and told him I was trying to sleep. Well my bed is in the main room with some partitions. Long story.

And the main room light is on, I turn it off and he immediately turns it on.

&gt; Ugh if you want to not have any lights on then move out or suck it up!

Uhh... what? That doesn’t make any sense.

So he had the audacity to walk 2 inches close to my face and expected me to be okay with it. I told him like 3 times I needed personal space, and he didn’t listen so I pushed him away.

He claimed ‘self-defense’ and punched me hard. I was pretty mad at his BS excuse so I punched him back. He ran around the house ranting and raving. He threatened to kick me out of ‘his house’ (he’s just a tenant like me, but did bring me into the house) in ‘two weeks’ because I ‘bring the worst out of him’.

I told him I wasn’t responsible for anyone’s behavior and his aggressive behavior was pathetic, and I wasn’t intimidated by him. He kept following me around and such.

He also threatened to ‘do everything to remove me’.

Obviously my brother is an asshole but we’re in the middle of a pandemic. Also I don’t really have that much money and I don’t really know what to do. I think it’s kind of ridiculous somebody can use the act of turning off a light and some words to attempt to intimidate someone. 

He also locked me out of the house and I told him I was entitled to have entry.

177,"Hey everyone, I’m currently 162.5mg IR Seroquel and 15mg Mirtazapine.
Stats:
1. 28 years old
2. Male 
3. 220lbs, low body fat

I was hospitalized in October for debilitating tinnitus-induced insomnia and at that time, was on 300mg Seroquel. In a month I dropped down to 250, then in another month down to 225. For all intents and purposes I basically stayed on this dose until April 1st, when I dropped down to 200mg. I am 7 1/2 months in now and just dropped to ~162.5  last night. I am dropping in 12.5mg increments. 

I’m glad I’ve been reducing the dose because around the end of March, I noticed a VERY SLIGHT tremor in my hand when using a dropper for skin care. This tremor has become more pronounced and when I lift weights my whole body feels like it’s shaking with certain exercises. When I flex my arms my hands will shake a lot, but this is completely absent at rest—only then will I get an occasional jerk/twitch of a random muscle group every four hours or so. I’ve been lifting for 12 years and have never experienced this sensation. It is incredibly upsetting and I fear that this will be a long-lasting or permanent EPS of Seroquel. So I would be stuck with a banshee in my ear and the inability to control my musculature. Awesome.

However, because of the reduction dates and timing of this symptom’s appearance, I can’t accurately say whether this is a withdrawal or a tardive side effect of quetiapine.

My questions for people who have been on seroquel: did you ever experience this trembling/twitching/shaking? Did it appear late? Did it appear during withdrawal? Did it get worse or better as you decreased? Did it dissipate?

I also have pretty constant tachycardia (~120bpm) and wake up with horrible anxiety every morning. I’m not sure if this is a side effect or part of withdrawal either. 

Thanks in advance.",04May2020,1

And worst of all, since most of us (execpt me and someone else) were not even there for a day, we couldn't even go outside. At least they had movies and board games. 3rd day was a turning point, a person got in a fight, and we couldn't get lunch (staff had to get it), and also we couldnt go outside. 4th day, i got in a fight and used minimal force to restrain the kid (same one who fought earlier). i got a little in trouble, but since i was calm it didnt really affect my stay time... (Also, the kid who fought me was there for like 3 weeks,kinda feel a bit sorry for him) 5th day, it was still boring, and also i was really really really tired. i think the kid who fought me, had to stay in his room. 6th day was probs the funniest day, a crush formed between two kids (MF) and (M) started to touch (F) inapropriately (yes, she didnt care). (F) Came, soiled her pants. had to make sure staff didnt know (they didnt,yet).if the sixth day was as bland as every other day, i would rate the place 2/10. but for the madlad who fingered a girl, ill raise it to a 4/10. 7th day was my final day, Not much happened, (M) and (F) got in trouble, and after i left, it took a while for me to feel not empty.

184,"I feel guilty for not telling anyone the whole truth. Even the person who knows the most about what’s going on with me doesn’t know all of it.

I feel guilty about not telling my parents that I’m struggling, but I can never get myself to them anything personal.

I feel guilty that I haven’t turned in the last two assignments for a class (we get 1 per week now, so it’s been 2 weeks since I’ve done something for that class), but it’s hard for me to start doing work. My motivation levels have dropped again.

I feel guilty that I haven’t gone to a lot of my online classes. They’re optional, but teachers still want us there. I can barely get myself to go. Just the idea of seeing other people makes me stressed anymore, and I usually feel worse afterwards. I feel like teachers would think that that isn’t a valid reason to miss because everyone has hard days and pushes through them. 

I feel guilty for sleeping in way later than I should everyday, but the way I see it, the more time I sleep, the less time I have to be awake. At the same time, I stay up way later than I should because I know once I’m trying to sleep and don’t have distractions anymore, I’ll start thinking again. People don’t realize that all I do is try and distract myself so I don’t start thinking.

I feel guilty because I think of myself as a bad person. 

The thing is though, my hard days aren’t just me feeling a bit down because something happened. My hard days are when I can’t stop the thoughts. I can’t stop wishing I could just disappear. I don’t want to die, I just wish I could disappear for a while. My hard days are when I just feel like crying because no one irl knows what exactly I’m going through, and I can’t get myself to tell them everything either. They’re when I wish I could just stay in bed all day. They’re when I don’t have breakfast or lunch because even though I feel hungry I don’t actually have a desire to eat, and if I do try and eat, I can’t eat much. They’re when I keep thinking about how no one even cares about what’s going on, and how I probably just annoy everyone around me.

186,"I am almost thirty and have really struggle with unemployment. I don't know if there is just something wrong with me that causes this but now I am afraid that the two fields I am trying to break into may be dead ends. Anyway, that is an aside, but maybe it gives context for what comes next.

So, I think my father has a lot of issues but he told me this yesterday:

&gt;\- Doesn't believe in it when they say you can do anything or be anything in school.  
\- Who else would stock the shelves or be plumbers if they could be anything they wanted to be (???)  
\- Not everyone can be in fancy careers, like lawyers and doctors (these are one in a million, according to him)

The sad part of this is that it has really effected me. I know I shouldn't believe this stuff because it is BS but I am so down now. He is not the type of person that makes you feel hopeful after you've spoken with him. I just can't snap out of this. I think he is projecting his feelings about education onto me. And he is always trying to encourage me to pursue things I have no aptitude for. I think for a long time I had just ignored stuff like this, as my coping mechanism but over the last few years I've taken a more active approach. Still, I feel a little blindsided and maybe surprised that this has effected me as much as it had. Probably will try to do something fun this afternoon, work on my job search; hopefully return to myself soon.

I'm not sure how helpful this would be for anyone but it feels good to get these thoughts typed out. Maybe this can be a reminder to someone else dealing with something similar that they are not alone.

188,"Hi! So please excuse my disorganized post. I can’t even bring myself to saying anything cohesively. 

So essentially, I’ve battled depression before and I believe I’ve re-entered a depressive state but my telltale signs aren’t ALL there and I’m experiencing something new: absolutely NO sex drive. 

Has anyone come across this? I’m assuming it may be fairly typical but personally I’ve never experienced it before. 

Aside from the pandemic and quarantining alone (which definitely is effective everyone’s mental health to some degree), I recently went through a break up. Ironically enough, we broke up because HE was going through a depressive episode and essentially boxed me out completely right before Christmas. I’m thinking about it more now that I’m not mentally well. At the time of the breakup I was incredibly mad that my grown man boyfriend ignored me for days and thus altered Christmas plans by avoiding me, but now I’m starting to see things a bit more from his perspective? Anyway, that’s not even what this post is about though. 

I’ve just noticed that over the last two months, I have not once felt “sexy” or “in the mood.” I know I’m by myself here so that doesn’t help, but even still I haven’t had any desire to be intimate at all. 

It’s like my existence has boiled down to just: get up, eat, work, pay bills, do a home improvement project, chat with a friend, Netflix, sleep, repeat. I don’t know if I’ve just become used to it but the thought of re-entering the dating world and having a social life in general is overwhelming and I’m kind of dreading it. I don’t feel sexy, I don’t feel like sipping wine, I don’t feel like meeting friends for dinner, I don’t feel like potentially running into my ex. 

I think I’m just really sad and I need words of encouragement.

192,"Hey I hope everyone's well and safe at the moment

I have a seriously hard time forgiving myself for everything. I'm 18m, was a teenage alcoholic addict and alcohol really brought out some bad shit in me and suffer from depression and anxiety. 

3 years ago I had bought a knife from a friend who was a collector. I had no intention of harming anyone at all, it was more just to flip and play with (looking back I'm not sure why I did, but I was out of it). I was very drunk one night, almost never slept and was anorexic, I saw my friend with some pizza and I begged him for a slice. He wouldn't give me any and as a drunk ""joke"" I took my knife out my bag and obviously he flipped and tried to get it from me. Even drunk I had no intention of actually harming him, but the intimidation and pure shittiness of what I did makes me feel fucking awful every day. 

He was and somehow still is one of my best friends, he forgave me a while after and were still close to this day. But I can't stop feeling so so bad about it. A similar thing happened a month later with another friend, not as serious but again he forgave me. Of course I apologised over and over, not to make myself feel better but to show them that's not how I really feel or am. Still it wasn't quite enough to make me quit drinking or drugs I was really in the deep end. That in itself I regret. 

Summer 2019 after another incident where I caused a massive scene at a party and nearly got my family in a car crash (I wasn't driving) I basically finally quit drinking spirits and wine. These days all I drink is beer and its not to get drunk,occasional 3 or 4 330ml San miguels. Soon I will be completely sober because its very clear alcohol isn't for me. 

Sober I'm not a violent person. The other week I put mouse poison down as a last resort after humane traps, saw one eat it and scared it off cos I knew it was gonna have a shit 4 days. I hate violence. I hate being told I'm a nice person, especially by people like my family who don't know everything I've done. 

I've tried meditating, therapy, CBT, medication, weed, exercise but I still get these intrusive flashbacks to all the bad shit I've done, especially these things and I beat myself up daily. 

I don't know what to do anymore

196,"Hello everyone. I hope this post fits this sub and that I’ll get to exchange with some of you - I’ll keep it as simple and clear as possible, but English isn’t my first language so i apologize if I make mistakes. 

Last year, I got into a relationship with someone - we can call her T. She had major commitment issues and broke things off after a few days but said she still wanted to stay friends, but I couldn’t do that back then, I wasn’t feeling great that day and completely shut down, making my biggest regret ever and losing her as a friend. 

I haven’t talked to her since then but I’ve caught up a bit about her on social media - she got depression checked among other things and talked about hurting herself and attempting suicide a few times since we broke things off. Coming back to this later. 

I have been, for a year, trying my best not to think about her. The months that followed the break up were the worst days of my short life (I’m 19) and it took me leaving all social medias and a few months to feel ok again. I opened up to new things and people but from time to time, regrets would catch me back and I would fall back in that dark state of mind that I got stuck on for a while. I recently reinstalled twitter, where we met, and it’s been... triggering. 
This is what I’m trying to understand. 

I thought I was fine after a year but reading about what she went through and seeing her interact with people we’re both friends with has be making me really anxious. I find myself shaking, throat feeling weird and wanting to cry when I think about her and it’s exhausting. 
I talked with friends and one rightly said that I needed closure, to talk to her again and clear things so I can feel that we broke things off in a happy way, but I am really scared of doing that. I struggle to speak about it with people I know in real life and I think it’s hurting me.

I wanted to know if that would be consider as some kind of trauma - the memories, the regrets, how harshly things ended and how I believe that things are all my fault. 
I know this might sound pretty lame compared to other things but it hurts a lot.

198,"So, I don’t know if this is the place but it has to do with my mental health. 

Here I go, I’m a 26 yo male from Europe. A few days ago I invited a friend over for some beers since the corona crisis has taken away the ability to go out and drink. 

I’m living in the house with 2 roommates for over 16 months. I don’t like one of the guys but we let each other be. Or so I thought... 

Let’s call the guy Justin and my friend Jake. 
Jake comes over for beers and Justin wants to join. I’m trying to get along with Justin because we are quarantined and therefore have to spend tome together. So when I asked to join in hesitantly agreed. 

We played some drinking games, keep in mind me and jake drink quite regularly a lot. No alcoholics by any stretch of the imagination but definitely more than most people. 
Because of our elevated tolerance we were still fine when Justin got a bit sloppy. 

Jake and I were talking about the stock exchange, oil crisis, unemployment issues and the ever rising modern colonisation of China. 

Jake and I are both aspiring day traders. 
Justin comes in with a ridiculous statement that China is buying land in Africa to make rice fields (????) what the actual fuck.... 
so we started laughing a bit and he couldn’t handle it so he choked me to the point where Jake has to pull Justin of my fucking back in order I didn’t pass out. 

I told Justin to fuck right off and go to his room or at least leave Jake and me alone. 

He wouldn’t have any of it and said like a little child: I’ll go to sleep once you go to sleep. 

So we proceeded to smoke some cigs and weed on the balcony. (It’s kinda legal here) 

After a while this fucking Justin wants to come on the balcony. I tried to keep the door closed but he pushed through and hit me in the face with a glass and continued to hit me in the face with the glass. 
I lost a metric fucking tonne of blood. Over 1.5 liters and had to have surgery immediately. 

I’m writing this from hospital 2 days later. 

I cannot stop shaking. I get sick and my resting heart rate is over 125 bpm. Partly because of the blood loss partly because of the shock. 

I’m hoping someone can give me advice how to stay calm and help me deal with the emotional distress I’m feeling all day long. I’m still unable to leave the bed which makes it impossible to escape my mind. Please, if anyone experienced violence by someone the trust, how did you deal with the outcome?

I awoke this morning anxious about all the things, because really, I’m a mess 85% of the time. Unemployment woes are plaguing me, self loathing, loneliness, mental health scares, and mainly personal failures just run through my head like a bullet train.

Anywho, I stay with my Grandmother once a week to keep her company (on a small rotation with other relatives—and before you ask: Yes, I’m being extra careful around her during this pandemic) because she’s lonely and has recently had a stroke.

While on my usually pleasant drive to her house down long country side roads, out of the blue I started thinking about this “friend” I used to work, and how we don’t talk anymore, and this made me extremely upset. It hit me, and HARD! I started feeling manic and intense. My eyes were welling up with tears and I was laughing and punching the steering wheel....

I almost drove into a the forest at 55 mph.
On impulse.

Then I was thinking about how I didn’t want to be late for my Aunt (who was with my Grandma) so she could get to work (she’s a medical professional). So, yeah, I stopped myself and drove (quite) slowly the rest of the way here in an effort to compose myself, I guess? I don’t know. Because in a flash I was fine again. Just fine. Maybe a bit numb, but whatever.

Had a quick conversation with my aunt, went up to see my grandma (who was—and is, still—napping), and came to sit in the kitchen by myself; staring out the window and completely zoning out. The house is very large and lonely, even when I know there’s someone else here. I don’t know why today of all days it feels so overwhelming and why I feel like throwing myself against a wall...

Fast forward to now... I’m eating their leftover fettuccine alfredo—because I can’t remember the last time I ate anything substantial—and I start quietly crying. Just a few tears coming down and falling off my chin into the pasta. I wasn’t thinking of anything in particular. Maybe it’s residual emotions from earlier?

Regardless, I recognize and admit that my mental health has been on a steady decline. I haven’t been to therapy in a good while, and I don’t talk to anyone about what’s going on (I know, I should). I was always confident I could handle myself; Maybe I could keep a control of my episodes. I generally know when they were coming, but now I’m scared, because I really did want to drive my car full speed into that deep forest. I’m simply feeling empty... I’m totally drained. I want to sleep, but I must keep myself awake for Grandma.

So, thought I’d post this here, on Reddit. I’m sorry if this is too much, or whiny, or plain pitiful. I needed to get it out.

My pasta has gone cold.

I think it was Goethe who said: “If you've never eaten while crying, you don’t know what life tastes like.” And I’m laughing again because life tastes like apathy and fettuccine alfredo.",04May2020,1

He put me on 50mg of seroquel daily, and it worked really well for about two weeks but i feel like my mental state is starting to reverse and im feeling alot worse again and im wondering if my body is becoming tolerant to it. Im having a lot of problems sleeping and focusing on things and i just cant at all. It takes me two hours to fall asleep every ight even though i exercise everyday and that should tire me out a bit.",04May2020,1

207,"Hi! So I will try to sum a little up about myself. 

I'm an incredible shy person and my confidence isn't the best.. My biggest fear is rejection, so I hold myself back from doing/saying stuff, because being rejected makes me feel unwanted and even unloved at times... I always worry about what other people think of me - And that somehow makes me a people pleaser, as I'm afraid of conflict. Being crowdy places or with a lot of people in general makes me anxious.

Yet on the other I'm somehow also afraid of being on my own. It generally makes me sad, whenever I have to say goodbye to my closest ones (For example when I visit my parents and have to go again, or when my significant other goes to work and I'm on my own) I fear that I will never see them again (Like what if an accident happens to them or what if said/did something and now they hate me or what if they are longer gone than expected). It makes me feel left behind and being alone kinda scares me. I'm completely unmotivated when alone, because I feel anxious and will sometimes burst into tears. I also feel like I need constantly recognition to know that I'm loved. I worry that I'm a burden to others",04May2020,1

212,"I wake up every morning wishing i hadn't my step mother makes the house that's supposed to be my home feel like a prison, every day she starts arguments with no purpose and i hate it

 I suffer from clinical anxiety and depression and she and my father both treat it like i can just get over it.. About 6 months ago I got out of a terrible abusive 2 year relationship and have been struggling to move forward but it makes it so much harder when I have no voice.. Nothing i say or nothing i feel ever gets touched on, my voice goes completely unheard so i just feel helpless.. I feel stuck. I'm 19 and this corona has cost me my job.. My only real way out was to make enough money to leave.. My dad is no better than she is, he does almost all the same things she does that make me hate life.

I spend almost all day every day in my room because there's no-where else I can call mine and even that has been taken.. My step mom refuses to give me that little sliver of privacy.. So i feel like I have nothing. 

Found out this morning my ps4 harddrive got corrupted for the 4th time in 2 weeks, so now i don't even have that to keep my mind occupied.

I dont feel welcome in my own home and I dont know what to do. After the break up i lost almost all my friends so talking to people is very hard.",04May2020,1
213,"I know I have written posts saying I am struggling. Right now, I am feeling worse than I ever thought possible, and the funny thing is that I don't have any suicidal thoughts that go along with this feeling! That is my positive for the day, at least.

The problem is that I found out yesterday that we are most definitely moving within the next 30 days. We aren't being evicted or anything like that, but this apartment is way too small for the seven of us and we have been talking about it since I had gotten home from prison in January. Back then, I didn't want to even think about it because I had just transitioned back into the ""normal"" world and it would have been way too tragic for me to make such a big change at that time. Now, I have been out for four full months (I am in my 5th month of freedom) and I am feeling a bit more stable, even with this COVID-19 thing happening. Another positive. I mean, it isn't all negative. I just found out that I have severe asthma (no doubt made worse by the cockroaches we'd had in our house prior to me going to prison and then moving here to this apartment) and chronic anemia (my hemoglobin was 8.2 and has been hanging out there for a long time), but otherwise, my heart is fine (YAY!) and my overall health isn't all that bad. Another positive! So, yah...I still have pretty persistent depression and anxiety (though I haven't cut in a long while now!!), which brings me to the problem I am having now.

The problem with moving is that I have been in this neighborhood since 2004. Yes, 16 years. I have walked the same route to the local grocery store and back (about 2.5 miles total) every day before I had gone to prison, even on the coldest, snowiest, or warm and humid and stormy days. I have walked in the snow, the rain, bad thunderstorms, sunny, gorgeous Spring and Summer days, and gorgeous cooler and sunny Autumn days, as well as Winter days where the sky was the color of slate and threatening to snow, or the color of sapphires with puffy white clouds and a chill despite the lovely sunshine. In other words, it has been my world for a long, long time and...I just can't leave it. The place we are moving to is firstly in what we call ""The Hill Section"", which is NOTHING like the neighborhood (GreenRidge) in which we live now. There is NO crime here...nothing going on...and people all know each other. Now the neighborhood to which we are moving doesn't really look all that ""bad"" since it is almost into the next small city (borough) over, and that small city (borough) isn't really known for crime either. Positive. 

Sorry this is so long, but I am really really heartbroken over this. All I know is here in GreenRidge...I really LOVE this place so much, and the people. A small mom and pop store is 2 blocks away (not even) and I have grown to love those people with my whole heart. They are closed now because of the Corona pandemic, so by the time they open back up, we will have been gone out of the neighborhood for months. :( I am just struggling so hard with this. I am crying constantly every time I go outside and look at the neighborhood that I will be leaving. It isn't only the walking part--our youngest's school is literally a few hundred yards from where we live now...and now we will be across the dang city. We might have to home-school him for his 5th Grade (and final Elementary Grade) year if the school won't allow him to have a neighborhood exception. I don't see that being a problem since he has a lot of ""school-based"" programs in place already for his Autism and I doubt they would want to move him out of a place where he is already established, partly for the programs reason and partly for the fact that Autistic kids don't do well with transition period. Transitioning him to the Middle School is going to be bad enough for 6th Grade...I doubt they will make that more difficult with another transition the year before. 

I guess I will shut up now. Y'all are great if you read all this. Incidentally, I, myself, am Autistic (Asperger's) so this transition from a neighborhood that I have known for a long time to one I have never known is really, REALLY stressful...and I am trying not to cut to compensate for that. So far so good. We lost our first house to Foreclosure (we weren't very good at budgeting, etc. being newlyweds and unaccustomed to real life) and we (ironically enough) had moved from the Hill Section to GreenRidge, to an apartment on the same street we are on now. Then we found a house right next door to that apartment building (moving was super easy lol) so we stayed in this area. Now we are moving back to where we started, not actually that far from the first house.

Can someone just give me a hug? I hate moving (as we all do, I am sure) and I hate having to get to know a whole new area, even though for most people that might be quite the cool adventure. Not for someone like me.

The apartment is REALLY REALLY cool though. I have to add that. It sits on a hillside and there is an actual ""room underneath the stairs"", but with no door. The landlord is a sweetheart that ACTUALLY LIVES IN THE SAME CITY AS HIS PROPERTY!! That is BIG because when we had moved to the first apartment (after losing the first house), the landlord had lived in New Jersey and we NEVER saw him at all...not to fix things, nothing. He had no ties (helpers, workers) in this area at all. It sucked. He also looks a little like the Late George Carlin and is funny as hell. :) OK, now I am smiling a bit. He is really cool and I took a liking to him immediately. He wasn't even put off that I had been in prison for Arson...though that was the most uncomfortable conversation I had probably ever had. Heh. He said he rents to all kinds of families and all kinds of people and that some of his renters are a little...mashugana. Look that up...yeah lol. :)

Anyhow, I feel a bit better now. Thanks for listening my fam.

216,"A few years back due to family discord and financial breakdown , at a young age I was forced to live in an absolutely run down crime riddled shit hole of an apartment , at the time I was unemployed and very very depressed , I could barely get any sleep and my nutrition was awful , the nearest shop was about 2 miles away so everytime I got a food shop in I hiked the two miles with a whole whack of food which was back breaking .

My neighbors would party 24/7 literally everyday all day and all night , all on drugs , there where stabbings and beatings all the time around the area. On occasion they asked me into party but I was so depressed and ditached all I need was sleep and time to let my mental health recover .

This went on for months upon months pretty much the whole time I lived there .

I could hear everything going on I people talking shouting and screaming , and I was lucky if I got about 30 hours sleep a week.

Besides that the alcoholic up stairs would wake up at all hours of the day and night and chuck his guts up .

The place was like down town Baghdad . Because of my already shaky mental health it made me absolutely demented .

Eventually I found work and ended up working 100 hours a week for a few years , 

Between lack of sleep and over working I eventually had a mental breakdown . I earned enough money to move . And got out as soon as possible it had a big impact on my mental health and still seems to effect me.

A few years ago I moved into another apartment and it's nowhere near the same , but I can hear people moving about but that's normal .

Because of my previous experience , I hate living in close quarters . Im highly aware and alert to noises and even the slightest noise makes me paranoid . Like people can hear what your doing or are listening to your ever move . Any mumbling of voices makes me paranoid . I get this way because when I was living in that flat you could hear neighbors complaining about why I wouldn't come in and party . And I did your god damn head in when your depressed and exhausted and all you want to do is sleep or relax for 5 fucking minutes and watch TV .

How can I get voices out if my head . Living in close quarters pits a big strain on me because if my previous experiences, but I compartmentilise and out it to the back of my mind . But for sure there is a constant loop of some shit going on in my head 

This is abnormal and how can I get help for this , or is there even any help",04May2020,1

I’ve also just cut the majority of my friends off for being two faced and toxic. I’ve been working on self improvement and focusing on myself, but I just feel so alone. I only have one close friend now and when he’s working/sleeping etc. I literally have nobody. I’ve always had really bad social anxiety meeting friends and even potential girlfriends. The one girl who I’ve been with approached me. I don’t want to come off as creepy, but also due to having cystic fibrosis, although I do look after myself pretty well, that triggers my anxiety. I had a lot of childhood trauma, I was abused by my stepdad for 8 years and hit it from my mum, and I’m trying to start anxiety treatment but this has been put back due to the coronavirus. I would love to be self confident within myself and not care what others think but this just doesn’t happen.

225,"I am lost. I feel like I’ve been dropped into someone else’s life. Someone much stronger than I. She has a wonderful life, but I cannot handle it. How did I get here, in her spot? I am ruining it all for her because I am breaking under the slightest stresses. I feel like a cheap imposter.

Some days, I will wake up, and I actually am her! She’s so optimistic, and she can handle anything that comes her way. She gets shit done. People love her. I really like those days. I sit back and watch her live her life. I am at peace on those days. On the other hand, there are an increasing number of days where I cannot find her in me. Or rather my presence is smothering her. 

I know this sounds like crazy talk. I am *so very well aware* of that. Am I thinking this is actually happening, or am I pretending there is someone else in this body? Why do I differentiate between us, as if she is the hero and I the monster? I feel like these days where I am moody and lethargic, lazy and worthless, angry and pent up - this is me. I don’t know how else to describe it. This is who I am. 

The happy girl is appearing less and less often. I wish I could reach out to her. She’s needed.

We share memories. It pains her when she remembers the days where I am in control. I know she’s terrified of not returning every time she goes to sleep. When did we split into two personalities, though? Neither of us can recall. We only began recognizing that there was “someone else” recently, but we both remember times this could have been caught sooner.

I don’t want to exist. I want her to succeed. She can’t overpower me, though. There’s too much of me. I keep growing. I think it makes her shrink. No matter how sorry I am, I can’t fix this. There is something wrong with me. I want her to take over. I don’t know how to help her. I don’t know if I’m capable.

Lately, I’ve been the one piloting. She has popped up on only two occasions in the past several weeks. I don’t know what the trigger is to get her to come out. I don’t know if I am the one actually getting triggered out or what that trigger may be for me.

I know when she remembers that I wrote this, she’ll laugh it off nervously and delete it. She tries to deny that I exist and that I will come back.

I am drowning. Overwhelmed with negative emotions. It’s all I can do to shelter the residual hope she carries to be able to make it to the next day she’s in charge. The less often she’s here, the smaller that flame is. How am I supposed to carry on her life when I can’t motivate myself to even consume food when hungry? I’ve ruined her career, making her change jobs at least 4 times in the last year alone by believing that I don’t belong anywhere. I’ve damaged her relationships, casting doubts on her friends’ true feelings towards this vessel. I am paranoid, afraid, anxious. A deer in headlights. I shut down. The only reason I can carry out some of her responsibilities is that she has a few amazing friends and a very devoted husband that try to help.

When she is afraid in the moment, she acknowledges it and finds a way to work around it. She keeps moving forward with her life despite the fact that I am here and making it a mess for her. 

Please help her, please help. Please.

We take 40mg of Fluoxetine. We switched from the otc-Zoloft near the middle of last year. She tried changing because the sex drive shut down. It has not been revived. She’s also tried different birth controls to no effect in that regard (going from daily pill to quarterly shots to an arm implant over the last few years). I think the initial depression med switch worsened my situation, meaning that I am here more often. Due to the pandemic, she has refrained from talking with her usual medical care provider since we are not suicidal. Because of financial reasons, she stopped visiting her therapist. Neither of them know there are two of us because we did not recognize each other when she was visiting them regularly.

What can I do? We live in the US. 

Thank you for your time, whether you are able to help or not. If you could refrain from saying something mean, I’d appreciate that as well. I know I am seriously mentally ill. In my current status, I feel like I can’t do anything more than post this.",04May2020,1

At first, I don't have any major mental health problem but I do have a recurrent problem which might have deeper root. When I'm facing an emotional content (such as someone playing a slow and  melancholyc piano partition, or a specific scene in a movie) I do have a sharp nerve influx affecting one part of my body and causing a short, but fast uncontrolled and unpredictable movement. It also cause an unpleasant feeling due to those aspects. Those influx are causing movement to my finger and my feet but it also happens to my arms, shoulder or knee (once at a time).

I’m a f19, raised in America- for some quick background info that’s probably relevant. 

     I’ve dated 4 guys in my life, each relationship lasting longer than 6 months. The first two were really simple, mainly cute fluffy stuff you’d expect from early teens like handholding and regular kissing. The relationship after those was abusive. The guy was a narcissist, and emotionally/ sexually abusive to me. The sexual abuse was mainly coercion. I said no to him 30 times until he took my defeated silence as a yes type of thing. I was with him for almost three years before breaking up with him for someone else (who I’m still with and makes me feel super safe and happy :) ). While dating the abuser is when I started getting super paranoid about my periods and when they’d start. Even though we never really did anything that would get me pregnant, I always became super scared right before it would start. I used to do really destructive stuff like eat as many vitamin c pills as possible (makes hormones wack), or punch myself in the gut. I get urges to do that still, but haven’t in awhile. I’m confused as to why I still get like that now, almost two years later. 

     My Cycle is kinda irregular, I’m only on the day 30 Mark when my average is like 28-32. Today’s been really Bad. I haven’t done anything sexual since before my last period, and even before that I hadn’t done anything without some form of protection (condoms, but even with condoms my bf didn’t like. cum in me). But I’m still very almost obsessively paranoid I’m pregnant, even though it’s basically impossible.

233,"During my last appointment (on Zoom) my therapist really rubbed me the wrong way. There were a few problems I had with our session.

The first problem was that I felt like I couldn’t get a word in. It started out fine but then every time I said anything about what I’m currently going through, she would launch into a long (and I mean long) story about what she’s been going through. A few times she interrupted me to tell a story about her self. 

Another problem was when she snapped at me. I was talking about my religion (I’m Christian and I believe faith can relate to mental health) and how my views sometimes differ from others in my religious community and that can put me in stressful situations. I gave an example of something I interpreted differently and she immediately said the type of stuff others in my religion have said to me and she seemed mad. (The topic was gay marriage and her comment makes it seem like she’s against it). I thought that was unprofessional. This isn’t a place to debate religious views. It’s my therapy session!

The last issue is her communication. I accidentally missed our next zoom session because my days were mixed up since there’s so little structure in the week now. It was weird she didn’t call because for all she knew something could’ve happened to my WiFi. But I decided to just email her to explain my situation and ask to reschedule. No response for a week. So I text her. No response for three days. Eventually she responds “we’ll be in touch.” The response just felt odd to me.

I’m not sure what I should do. Should I schedule another session or find another therapist when I can. I’m on the fence and was hoping this would help. Also, idk if this matters, but I’m mostly going to her for diagnosis so I can eventually be medicated. It’s not much of a ‘dig up past trauma’ thing.",04May2020,1

Hi there friends I'm looking for advice. I am 31, unemployed since 2018, around the time I completed my undergraduate degree. I graduated with honors. I just couldn't find myself in the world and I had savings and today I live with my grandmother and help her around the house. Plus I was recently diagnosed with a chronic illness that I am just now learning to live with.

I want to hear tips on how to rebuild my life at such an advanced age and despite my poor resume. I live in a very small town, I have no money to leave and one of my problems here is that I feel that my reputation is completely destroyed, people see me not working, walking alone on nights in the city, everyone thinks I am already lost. Some people even today don't say hi to me on the street and pretend they don't know me. Everyone forgot that I was a successful person and social in the past, I have probably too. How can I restore my life back to the path of success? I feel a joke.",04May2020,1
237,"I have an unhealthy addiction to snapchat streaks.

Not in the way that I have one with a million people, only really 10-ish, but like, I feel like I can't lose them, like once I see that hour glass I get really bad anxiety, and I hate it and I don't know why.

I didn't use to, but now I feel like I do.

A lot of them are with high school friends, and in my head, because I don't see my friends anymore, snapchat is the way that I feel like we're still connecting. But like, I don't think I could name all of my streaks, like there's some people who I haven't talked to ,but because our streak is 1k days I'm like oh I have to keep it. Even if I haven't talked to the person in a year.

Then there's the people who go to my college, currently, that I have streaks with, and I care a lot about them too. And some friends are graduating, so I know that it will be lost eventually, so I'm in a tough place, do I just break it now, or wait for them to break it? Because I know it will inevitably be lost.

I just hate that I see the hourglass and I get really anxious, not anxiety attack anxious, but like, butterflies, heart palpations, sweaty palms etc. 

And I hate it, but I don't know how to get it to go away.

I know the obvious answer is just break them, but like, I don't know. And I know the other people definitely don't care about it at all.

And it's not like I put thought into them either, I just go down the list ""click click click"" and hit send same photo to everyone, except for some people when we actually talk through our streaks, but like.

I just hate that I care so much about losing them",04May2020,1
238,"Hi, I suffer with anxiety and depression. Lately i’ve been struggling a lot to keep a positive mindset. Its like as soon as anything happens, my negative mind completely rules over the positive side, and its really overwhelming. I dont like to feel self-pitying but my first reaction to anything negative is literal worst case scenario. This is causing a massive strain on friendships/relationships. i’ve done my best to try to change,  done CBT &amp; DBT, tried meditation, grounding exercises etc. Literally nothing seems to be working, its such a struggle to have a good day and I really want to change this as theres so many good moments I am missing out on due to my mindset. Im really struggling to make friends / maintain them also due to this. Please if anyone has any advice on how to stop these thought processes it would be much appreciated.

Also if anyone is going through anything similar (or just needs a chat)  feel free to drop a message :)",04May2020,1
239,"I’ve posted my story on reddit so many times. But I can’t figure out how to move on.

I’m 18 years old, and I grew up through some really messed up situations. Throughout my whole life, my dad has been emotionally abusive. He’s had so many affairs with my mom growing up, and has threatened to leave numerous times. 

My parents were extremely rough on me growing up also. They practically forced me to work from the age of eleven, doing labor type work etc.

I also grew up homeschooled and basically socially isolated.

They’ve also done sexual things in front of me one time when I was young. Which I don’t know if that is considered sexual abuse, but I know it had to have messed me up. 

On top of this, my mom did some weird things to me also. She sexually touched me a few times when I was young. 

And she used to make me do things that were just strange, like put on her bra, messaging her etc. however she used to say she was on heavy medication that caused her to do weird things. She is sick with some health conditions so...

At the time these things happened, I didn’t know what was normal. So I didn’t realize until recently how much of toxicity I went through.

I know these things messed me up mentally, and as a result, I had incest and voyeurism type fantasies throughout my teenage years. And I eventually acted on them as well. 

I used to peek at my mom in the shower, go through her underwear drawers, and I ended up groping her one time. I also used to spy on my parents have sex too.

At the time I groped her, when I was 15, she had kind of changed, and she reacted badly. And told me how wrong it was. 

On top of this, she says she doesn’t remember doing the things that I know she did to me when I was younger. I don’t know if she is denying it, or if she actually doesn’t remember because of the medication she was on. But I know these things happened. 

Anyways, I don’t really have these problems anymore. I stopped at around 17 years old, (I’m 18 almost 19 now). And I think I can safely say I’m a different person than I was a year ago. This is because now I just don’t feel the urge to do those things anymore. And now I realize how wrong it was. And I feel really guilty for it.

Of course, I still have issues, I am not okay. But I think I’ve managed to completely stop the voyeurism and incest problems. I still have fantasies, not of my mom, but I still have the voyeurism and incest fetishes. However, I feel like I can trust myself not to act on them anymore.

And I feel good about that. But I don’t know how to move on from the things they did to me, and the things I did. 

I really hate my parents for it, because I feel like they are the reason I became so messed up in the head. 

Furthermore, I want to distance myself from my parents. This is because I’m not comfortable around them, and I just really hate them. I don’t think I can forgive them for the things they did to me. 

And I’m not justifying anything I did, I still hate myself for the things that I did. I just feel like they are the reasons why I did these things in the first place.

I just want to move on with my life, but I don’t know how. I’m now worried about my parents telling others and/or reporting it to the police in the future.

The reason I’m worried about this is because they have two sides. When I start to cut ties, they’re obviously going to lose it. And I feel like they’ll do it out of spite.

If that happens, then I feel like it’s over for me. Everyone will hate me, and I’d might as well kill myself. 

And I feel like, just because I’m a guy, and because of how manipulative they are, no one would believe me about the things they did to me. 

So in all, I don’t know how to move on and forgive myself for the things I did, and move on from the past. And I also don’t know what I’m going to do in the future. 

What if my parents do tell others and/or report me to the police for what I did. I can always tell others and report them for what they did to me. But who would ever believe me? 

I feel like I’m just reaching a dead end. And I don’t know what to do. All I want is to live a normal life and move on. But I’m worried I won’t experience that. 

I’m trying to follow my passions, and see where they take me. I want to start a music career. Or go to cosmetology school. But I’m constantly thinking “What’s the point in all of this, when I’m just reaching a dead-end in my life.”

I really don’t know what to do, and I can’t afford any mental help as of right now. And there’s no free help that I know of where I live.  

Sorry for this super long post. I just need to vent, and I feel like it’s best for me to do it anonymously.",04May2020,1
240,"I've been seeing my therapist for almost a year now. I really like her. We've built up a good working relationship. But a month ago she decided to move to a new agency. She told me twice a week would be possible at this agency, but it'd be almost double the price. I was okay with that. But when I moved over with her, she told me that the clinic has a policy against letting their therapists do more than once a week. I needed twice a week, especially now with the quarantine. But mostly I just feel hurt by the limitation. 

She does other things for the clinic, like running an expensive  intensive out patient group. This place doesn't have a good reputation. So I immediately thought they limit the amount of times she can see her patients in a week so that those patients sign up for one of their more expensive programs. The more patients she can take on, the more people they can push into those things. On the other hand most of her time is spent doing the IOP. So they'd want her to be able to handle as many clients as possible. But what's the point in taking on as many clients as she can if she can't help them to the extent that they view they require? 

I've brought up my concerns, but she's never acknowledged that it's a bad situation, let alone apologize for putting me in it. I know two things can be true at the same time. I don't think she did anything wrong by moving to a place they'll pay her more. But she's a person in my life, and her actions effect me. The most I've gotten is an ""I'm sorry this made you feel this way"" which everyone knows is a non apology. I'm not sure if it's part of her philosophy regarding therapy, or a company rule that keeps her from acknowledging how this has effected me. 

I don't want to switch therapists. but she has a conflict of interest on this topic, and it's effecting me negatively. How is she supposed to validate when she's and her bosses caused the problem?I couldn't even find someone else now if I wanted to. And I don't want to leave this relationship feeling betrayed and angry.

I shouldn't be writing while I'm feeling anxious (I'll probably read this in the morning feeling like an overreacting embarrassment).

245,"Hey, Friends!

Have a trigger warning: schizophrenia!

Apologies for the big-ass wall of text.  Part of my reasoning for writing this was just to get my thoughts down, and I never know what is relevant information, but I'm very interested in what anyone else has to say about it as well, considering it's caused me a good deal of anxiety.

At the very least, I hope it makes for an interesting read!

Thanks!

\-

I've been dealing with some mild-yet-constant dissociation for a few years now, and was eventually told I needed to be checked out for schizophrenia.  That sent me into a downward spiral where I scared myself into thinking I was seeing and hearing things (they were actually just eye floaters and sounds that others could hear but ignored) and started dealing with a lot of intrusive thoughts about the government being after me (part of me knew it was absurd, and my therapist and psych told me it was just my thoughts scaring me, which made sense).

Once I had my EOF with the psych, I was told that I was in the clear with schizophrenia!  I had some anxiety (which is normal for me), but all-in-all, I had a *really* good two months: got back into some projects that I'd been putting off, started getting into some physical activities, and even left this sub (for myself; the sub itself is fantastic).  Hell, I hadn't even been too worried about COVID, which is really interesting, considering my primary diagnosis was hypochondria (and some mild OCD).

About a week or two ago, though, shit hit the fan.

About two years ago, when I was speaking to my therapist, I noticed her face seemed distorted.  It freaked me out a bit, but it only lasted a fraction of a second, so I wrote it off.  However, over time, the fear of that episode became way more intrusive.  I worried that it was a legit hallucination, that I was developing schizophrenia, and so on.  My therapist/psych said it was likely just some weird trick of the eye, likely caused by fatigue or something like that, but over the past two weeks, it's been so hard to write off as a one-off bit of weirdness, and has caused a lot of anxiety.  I eventually mentioned it to my wife, and she said that she's dealt with that before.  That was comforting, but...

I had happened to read that delusions can form as a result of hallucinations; something weird happens, and a weird explanation is created by the brain.  Because I am nothing short of the biggest dummy on the planet, I actually went out of my way to think ""what if her face seemed distorted because she's actually a monster?"".  This stupid-ass thought has stuck with me to this day.

Part of me is able to recognize that this isn't right, but asking myself ""do you actually believe this"" causes my brain to lock up and not answer the question.  This has left me with a few options:

- I don't believe it, it's just an intrusive thought that I'm giving way too much power to.
- I do believe it, but I'm able to recognize that it's not normal
- I believe it fully and consider it ""normal""

I can't tell if I'm anxious with a bit of insight, or delusional with a good deal of insight that will decrease over time, and that's both frightening and infuriating.  Not to mention the thought of her being a monster itself is frightening: how do you argue against something that is borderline unprovable and unfalsifiable?  (""Oh, you can't see the monster?  That's because they only appear to me.""  Etc.)

I'm honestly not sure how to end this, so we'll call this good.",04May2020,1

Trigger warning: sexual abuse, animal abuse, physical abuse, rape, drugs



I’m very sorry it’s so long a lot has happened. How my mother grew up her mother (my grandma) was an alcoholic and father (deceased grandfather) was physically abusive maybe sexually she is diagnosed bpd. She grew up rich but having an abusive childhood she went through a rebellious stage at 18. She fell in love with a good man but her father wouldn’t allow it with him. So she turned around and picked the biggest loser she could a coke dealer she knew they dated they used then she got pregnant my mother was disowned you her father(that’s how my older half brother came to be) so they married because of it and after 6 months divorced. 3 years later she meets my father at a bar they marry a couple years into marriage they have me. So it’s my mom my father my half brother me in a house.

My grandma divorced her father a year later he dies all the money he had disappeared in medical bills trying to save him as long as possible. 

Now I’m switching to my POV. My father was nice to my mother few years and then physically abusive not allowing her to have a job if she got a job he would go to her work and get her fired sit in the waiting room menacingly till boss says we can’t allow this. I remember us having to walk to preschool because he wouldn’t allow us to drive because he didn’t want us to have a chance to leave. He was physically abusive toward me and my brother as well type to hide bruises. I just though it was normal for men to be a**holes as a little kid like I thought it was biological. 

I had started displaying weird health issues around 4 hypnagogic hallucinations (at night always) often like I would be getting attacked in my bedroom at night it’s like a night terror times 5 I would appear wide awake and horrified that something was going to hurt me or it would actually look like something was attacking me this went on often till I was like 12 but it happened less frequently after I was maybe 9. My family genuinely worried I might have been possessed. I was also a really bad bed wetter. My mother slept with me in my bed till I was like 7 she said it was because the night terrors later on she told me it was she was so afraid of being alone in a room with my father. He would also beat our dogs.  

I know my brother was molested by him and my mother was raped I don’t talk about it with them because it’s not my place to take them back to that I never saw any of that but upon being told at 12 I wasn’t surprised at all.I don’t know if anything happened to me I don’t remember. I was molested by a neighbor hood girl when I was in kindergarten garden and a female babysitter slept with my brother those are the only other incidents I know about. 

One night after a bad beating I begged my mom to divorce him when I was 6 and she wasn’t able to do it till a year later but she still let him have visitation. He did kidnap me once a few days through my bedroom window. Mom didn’t do anything about after a few days he basically left me at a place by a fountain and told her to pick me up because he didn’t know what he was doing. He would often break into the house when we weren’t there and leave presents. 

My mother got remarried to a man 1 year after the divorce with my father and being 8 and wanting my dad to finally leave I played up a bond with the new guy even though I really disliked him. The first time I met this second guy I told him he didn’t belong here. But in front of my father I pretended to really like him because I knew he needed like a final push to go away and it worked. 

So my mother eventually married this second guy and after a year he is really abusive toward me as well I can’t do anything right I get screamed at about 4 hours a day daily. I would be force fed fermented food I was allergic to. I almost spend no time in the house I was always out with friends for about 5 years because I knew whatever I did I would be screamed at. I’ve been screamed at for drinking a glass of water wrong, for smiling, eating anything and every time I was yelled at I would sit on the stairs and blankly stare at him the whole time. 

Mother divorced 2nd guy 4 years in for being unemployed a year. Our home got foreclosed on even though we paid rent but it turned out the person we paid hadn’t paid mortgage in 6 months so my mom left the decision on me what to do at 12 I said let’s move back to our home state we atleast have family there to fall back on if things go bad my brother stayed in that state in the west being almost 18. 

We went back to the East. Upon coming back My mom got back in touch with loser friends from when she was young and on drugs she did cocaine again and totaled an expensive truck the only thing she got in the divorce. Then she got clean but drank often dating any loser she could from the time I was 13 to 17 she dated a heroin addict seen the stuff and needles in the home, a former crack head that I caught drinking our Mouth wash, a guy that wanted to ship me off to boarding school, one guy she also paid rent to but would try to pressure her into bjs if she didn’t pay on time,  2 other losers that’s all I know about and almost always they lived with us as well. Every bad relationship i begged her why are you doing this like don’t put your hand on the stove and she’s slam that hand on the stove. 

I started smoking weed at 14 and did it off and on in my teens till I was 20 I’d do it a year quit a year or 2 do it again a year so on. 
I was left alone at home like 5 days of the week after 16 was getting food from the food bank then I started cooking for myself at 12. She pressured me into going to college basically go to college or I kick you out so I went for something I didn’t care about didn’t drop out went for one term and did poorly surprise surprise at 18 when I wasn’t ready. I was working part time but it turned into full time and doing that on top of classes I didn’t want to take. 

She had 2,000 dollars worth of bills tied to my name because she had my SSN and I also had the student loan debt I think it was 3,000 upon moving out I left at 19 I basically had to beg someone I dated a year to move in and they let me. It’s 4 years later and it’s hard to see how anything is salvageable. 

My mom acts like I’m her sister, she’s always acted that way and I don’t hold her accountable for anything. I treat her like one because I know she can’t handle it. My father also never went convicted. I have no relationship with my brother because I think we were both just trying to live that we didn’t get to know each other we love each other but we can go without talking years on end. I feel like I have to pretend to be happy about my situation growing up when I’m around my grandma because she’s 70 and would likely take my mother’s side on anything and I don’t want to lie so I don’t like being around her even though I do love her despite her still being an alcoholic. She’s lonely and I don’t know how to spend time with my grandma. Even me and my mom agree she didn’t do a good job but let’s not lie about it anymore. I have no idea if any of this is salvageable or how to feel about my family. I know I’m making it sound like I’m a victim and everyone suffered. I just feel I got incredibly unlucky in the birth lotto.

You see, getting older I became very attracted to manipulation and bullying. I was a bully up until 12 and a manipulator up until now. Adulthood. It started by turning my peer’s life’s around for the worse. Convincing them to be my friend only to take what they held close and ruin them. It was always fun. It was something to do instead of being bored all day. But when I reached 14 things got weird. I manipulated adults by faking emotions. Being nice, or innocent meanwhile I was doing “bad things.” I have ALWAYS gotten out of trouble because I know how to pretend and lie. 14 is when the lying and emotion stuff got more real. But getting older I’ve been drawn to hurting again. I’ve done some bad things just so I can stop doing everything and theorizing against the government or making stories in my head. “Bad things” like sex, cutting myself open, drugs, drinking blah blah fucking boring. You get the gist. You see, some may say this is antisocial. But here is the thing. It isn’t. I feel emotions. I get angry and I feel joy. I get stressed, I get annoyed, get happy, get sad. I feel things. These emotions are very light and never stay, they quickly fade no matter what feeling. I do care for people. If someone is hurt I’ll help. But I have never had an empathetic feeling. I usually laugh or am highly entertained when people are struggling. But I feel stuff. Sometimes... I think. Either way, is this normal? I’ve never talked about it before and I don’t enjoy getting close enough to understand others. (I don’t care much and hate having friends.)",04May2020,1
262," Is there something wrong with me? Is this normal? I swear I'm not a violent person IRL, nor do I ever wish to harm anybody IRL or have any impulses. So what's going on here?",04May2020,1
263,I really crave affection from a partner but anytime someone tries to be affectionate I immediately shut down and reject their advances. It’s as if I get really anxious and want to flee. However when it’s someone who could be less interested I try really really hard to win them over. It’s very frustrating because I see it happen but I can’t explain it. It’s like a body reaction. does anyone else feel this way?,04May2020,1
264,"It’s a hard thing to talk about but my sister killed herself and my mother is in prison. When you know you are going to end up like them, how do you stop from killing your self? I mean, it makes sense.",04May2020,1
