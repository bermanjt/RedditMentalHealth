0,"I have my phone and the laptop I’m typing this on but I don’t have conversations over text, I don’t get it (how to have a conversation). I’m grounded because I have low grades (2 c's) and it affects our family but I don’t fucking get it. Like, what does that actually mean for my future and all I don’t get it most of the time I’ve either been able to talk my way into something or I just get fucking mad and get over it. Like, I broke my computer which is something that I used to play on a fucking lot, like over 8 hours a day, but it’s broke now and it’s whatever, I miss it but I was addicted to that shit and I’m anxious about playing games because it’s seen as a dumbass thing to do by most people so that keeps me from really caring and when I find myself caring I beat myself up. Now I just sit in 1 of 3 places and watch youtube and occasionally check instagram, sometimes I laugh at insta memes but I’m not sure if it’s partly genuine or not, I feel like it’s to make me feel “normal” and also a show for other people to make me seem like a better person (more social &amp; happy &amp; human). I think I might just have instagram because it allows me to play into a fantasy of not being super lonely &amp; too insecure. I’ve been too anxious to post there but there’s a confidence boost I got from it bc I’m following about 30-50 people and I have about 2x the followers so when people see my page they might assume that I'm more interesting/have a funny/social/good side. I can’t really talk to females or males conversation wise that’s why the only 2 friends I have are hyperactive as fuck because they just fucking talk and talk but it’s conversation and socializing where all I have to do is listen and I feel content with it even if they annoy the fuck out of me because I just want that human interaction. Sometimes I get energetic especially at night when everyone’s asleep &amp; I’m alone listening to music but it’s an awful feeling because of how I suppress it so much because I feel like I’m a fucking weirdo. I’m getting more insecure because my only friend who I ever hang out with talks more and more about talking to girls and hanging out with friends &amp; is active on social media I get insecure that he’s not gonna hangout with me anymore since that’s what another friend of mine did. When he started being more social now he barely wants to hangout with me and I kinda read signals that he doesn’t like me, not as much now since we had a good few short conversations about some drama that happened. I get a sense that he thinks I have a fucked up view on life &amp; shit so he is apprehensive about both being my friend and not being my friend. The act of having conversation with anyone makes me fucking anxious because I feel like I can’t have a normal conversation, even my mom gets mad at me for it sometimes and my dad has to. Sometimes I get angry enough at my parents where I lash out physically but I could never yell because it makes me anxious, if I could it would probably help me get some anger out where it doesn’t build up like that but I can’t even speak with my normal voice I always do that high pitch thing people do when they’re anxious I can’t speak relaxed because there’s always a lot of tension in my voice. I’d love to branch out and meet new people but I genuinely get fucking confused when talking to people and can’t keep a steady train of thought because I have so many things going through my mind. Also, I have body dysmorphia not diagnosed like I have been with depression and anxiety but I haven’t ever went into detail with it. Just reading the symptoms and shit I know I have it, used to always look in the mirror whatever reflection I could 30-50x times a day, now I avoid mirrors altogether pretty much, one time I was at camp and didn’t recognize myself at first after catching a glimpse and I wish I could be like that all the time (never see mirrors) but that’s not realistic. I do think about it and judge myself constantly though occasionally I can’t help to look in a mirror but it’s not for a long time because I just can’t handle the stress it gives me. I've had suicidal thoughts because of it.",02Feb2020,1
1,"Hey guys im 16 and i have had anxiety most of my life and ive had depression for about a year now. Well, about 2 weeks ago i smoked a little too much weed and had a bad panic attack and i dissociated very badly. Since then, I have felt very numb and just kinda weird. My depression has gotten worse and im just constantly emotionless and bored. Also, i have been dissociating since then. It'll happen a lot throughout the day and last for maybe 30-45 minutes and after its over ill just be depressed again. But even after the initial dissociation period is  over i still feel kinda ""off"" I was just wondering what this is and could the weed have triggered something? Thanks for any responses.",02Feb2020,1
2,"Currently in university and do part-time programming work; high grades and decent pay but incapable of maintaining good/healthy habits for shit, zero self-control, life is an utter mess. I'm a lazy tosspot who whiles away most of my free time on pointless shit like abstract music/art and obscure software with no tangible value.

Been sleeping 3 hours a night the past month as my body just won't let me sleep more (and I have terrifying nightmares), and appetite fluctuates like crazy. Also been wrongly referred to an ""early intervention in psychosis"" unit as the deluded government social worker I had to speak to completely misconstrued me and made erroneous assumptions.

While I somehow still have friends, I'm a KHV/never had a gf as there's something intrinsically off about my personality; I used to do modelling so know I'm not hideous, girls have asked me to sleep with them and I've shared a bed but always too shy to make a move.

I spend hours literally talking to myself, as I get into arguments with myself as if I'm talking to another person and compulsively have to try resolve the conflict, it's really odd... even in public, I don't give a fuck anymore. I can't comprehend my internal monologue, it's like a personality that's continually shifting and trying to sabotage me.

Only reason I haven't killed myself is I couldn't do that to my family, but I'm effectively killing myself in life smoking like a chimney and drinking like a fish to escape this torture, don't know how to stop.

Venting I guess but desperate for any advice on what to do, if anyone else has been in a similar situation, and just how to feel normal and want to work towards something ultimately constructive and more than myself so to speak.",02Feb2020,1
3,"I'm going to regret not making this on a throwaway account, but whatever. 

I've dealt with having depression in the past, I'd say since fifth grade to, maybe half of sixth grade, which led to few suicide attempts. I knew why I did most of it, and that was because of my mom. She was a paranoid, narcissistic schizo and pretty crazy. Recently, she lost custody of me because of her taking me states away from my home state without my, or my dad's consent and she didnt let me pack anything. Anyway, ever since that even happened I've just felt so numb, and it's been hard to have empathy towards anyone, and I've manipulated and lied to so many people. I feel like everyone is going to outsmart me, but I tell myself not to be like my paranoid mother. I can't keep any relationships because I find it hard to talk to people, and I'm pretty antisocial, and very bad at keeping and committing to relationships, as for example, I had a relationship that I was quite happy in, and I'd say I felt something towards him, whether or not the feelings were forced by me or not, and I lost it. I also lost my closest childhood friend a year ago, which wasn't too hard to get over, but a lot to comprehend because I knew I wouldnt have her around anymore, because I've felt like I've had nobody to talk to about my past emotions, or how I feel now. Welp, let me know what you guys think.. I probably need therapy",02Feb2020,1
4,"I have impulses to do things certain amounts of times. Like turning doorknobs or having things in line. Whatever happens to the left happens to the right then to the middle. The amount of times I can do an action is 1 3 5 6 15 35 30 33 35 50 51 53 55 60 61 63 65 75 100 times, so if I don't do a certain routine like turning on taps 3 times correctly I then have to do it 5 times and so on. I don't want to do any of these routines. It's just an impulse. I haven't been diagnosed with OCD, however I have with aspergers. These routines get very frustrating when I'm on a schedule. I've tried not doing them but it feels like a weight on my brain that I can't take off until I do. Do I have OCD or is it something else?",02Feb2020,1
5,"I am new to my field. I have been in my job for a year now. Great boss, the type of work itself is great (although can cause stress due to there being a lot of work and I'm the only manager in my department at that site to do that work), the residents I work with are lovely and I have helped make some great mental health changes for them to improve their quality of life, but the last few months have caused undue stress due to staff/coworkers. They have been escalating more recently, with this past week feeling like I am being completely disrespected and my opinions and knowledge base entirely undermined and ignored. My boss (she works at our sister site but does try to come weekly) sees what is going on and is aware of the negative dynamics. I am working with her to try and continue to grow in my own ways as a manager as well as hopefully to help reduce these negative coworker interactions, but honestly I have had a few instances where I've not wanted to come into work because of the staff issues. 

In a conversation about my frustrations I told my partner that if the environment becomes too toxic I will look for a new job. He has argued with me on a few occasions since that this is a bad idea, because he claims that I will be the ""bottom of the totem pole"" and if there are any cuts I am first to go (healthcare, and in AB Canada, so currently that is actually a reality unfortunately). Much like coworkers, he is focusing on one single part of an entire context I've laid out and essentially making it out that I'm going to quit tomorrow because one staff said something mean to me. No, this is a hypothetical of if over the rest of this year things escalate or continue to stay as they are with no improvements even with my and my boss's best efforts and it starts to regularly/significantly carry over into my own mental health stability and triggers poor mental health (dx bipolar 2) that in turn might possibly affect performance and even attendance, then I would 100% try to find a new job ASAP.

Obviously, I understand that with any new job there are risks. He claims that if I were to be in an interview and were asked why I'm leaving, if I explain that there is a negative working atmosphere within the job that I would basically be taken out of contention. Whereas I would see no issue with a potential employee saying that they are striving to find a healthier workplace that would enable them to really showcase their abilities and talents in the best way possible while making the work they do enjoyable in a way that it isn't currently at the current location despite best efforts made to ameliorate the situation.

So, if you were in my shoes with all this info taken into account... Do you:

1. Keep your current job while looking for a new job and then leave current one once you've been offered another job, even if this potentially means that you could *potentially* increase your chances of being cut at the new job because you have less seniority
2. Keep your current job and suck it up and don't look for another job because you might potentially have a smaller chance of losing current job due to being there longer.
3. Some other solution that was not proposed by either of us

I take my mental health and stability seriously, having struggled since I was a child and now 29YO. I don't need to put up with sh\*t at work if it means my health takes a beating, and I would much rather potentially increase my risk of job security by venturing out into another company if given the opportunity. I'm not stupid, I'd make sure i have enough money saved up to hopefully get me by long enough if I were to ever lose a job. And worst case scenario, I can't find a job in my title I take the non-managerial job in my field and get paid at the higher end of the wage scale (less than I'd make as a manager but enough to still live life).

6,"This past year has been one of the worst for me in regards to mental health. I’ve always been an anxious and skittish person, but lately I’ve been stuck in this constant back and forth of feeling fine then suddenly feeling this overwhelming sense of dispare, sadness, and overall negativity. Almost every other day I find myself crippled in on myself sobbing for no clear reason. 
In March I lost my grandmother who basically raised me and I was devastated, and I’m sure that is a factor of my pain but I feel there is something else contributing. I am confused on whether to seek therapy because after I pull myself out of an episode I feel completely fine until it happens again a few days later. I am tired of feeling this way, yet I have no idea what to do about it. 
I am healthy and I am getting an amazing postsecondary education yet I feel like there is something living in me and eating me alive. 
I’m tired and just want to be happy again.",02Feb2020,1
7,"Around the age of 16 and until around the age of 18, I wasn't able to cry at all, no matter how sad or touched I got. Suddenly, around the age of 18, I was really not okay and it's like all those emotions poured out and suddenly I was a frequent crier,very often crying when touched but something, but it would rarely he sadness. Now I'm 20 and within the past few months, I realized I haven't been crying at all. When I was 16, I could explain some of my emotional numbness with my parents' divorce, but I really don't know what the reason could be now. There are some little things, but nothing to really make me emotionally shut down. I'm feeling a lot better than last year, but is losing the ability to cry again a bad thing? What could be going on?",02Feb2020,1

9,"\[I know I need to go to an actual doctor/therapist for this, but until I'm able to yet, so I hope I could get a little advice from here (I'm not trying to be diagnosed or anything, just need a bit of advice).\]

I don't feel entirely real. It's an incredibly difficult feeling to explain. I never see myself from the outside or daydream, it's not that. It's this weird floating feeling. Feeling far away from existence. I can feel my body and objects around me, but I don't feel *here*. I don't feel grounded and clear-minded. I feel dizzy and floaty. Again, this is so hard to explain, so I'm sorry if this really doesn't make sense. 

For a bit of background, I've been badly isolated for around 4 years. I think I have an avoidant personality disorder. I have a debilitating fear of socializing, hence why I isolate myself (and I've never had real friends in my life, and I'm 22). Nearly the majority of every day for 4 years, I've been alone. It's been worse since my sister moved out, now I typically have zero human contact and I realize this is really detrimental to a person's mental health, I really understand that now because it's what' I'm experiencing.

Now, the rare times I'm around people, I feel quite airheaded and confused. And when I speak, I feel like there's so much pressure on me, so I get nervous and talk slowly, sometimes I even stutter (which isn't normal for me). It's like my mind is so clouded and dizzy, combined with my extremely severe social anxiety, that it feels like I'm talking while in a daze.

Also, recently, I've noticed while writing something like I am now, I feel like I can't express myself correctly. Like I can't find the right words to say, or that I'm saying the wrong things. It's like I have brain fog and I can't be as concise as I'd like to (I used to write a lot and be really good at it, so this also isn't normal for me). 

So, I just feel not real. It's scary. There have been a few times I had to drive recently and it just feels weird since I don't feel entirely here. 

Also, I've noticed a very small but weird change about me. In the past, when I had to open a bottle, I would hold the bottle in my right hand and then screw off the lid with my left hand -- I've done this my entire life. Recently, without thinking, I would hold the bottle and my left hand and then try to take off the lid with my right hand. That's something completely unnatural for me, so it's really weird that I would unconsciously do that. 

Has anyone experienced something like this? Do you have ways of feeling more real? I've thought maybe I have something like dissociation or derealization, but I don't have all of the symptoms. But I am extremely anxious and under stress pretty much all the time. I'd really appreciate any insight on this, and I'm trying to get to a doctor as soon as I can!",02Feb2020,1
10,"I get stressed by things in life, especially stress at work and stress about having a busy diary. They're both illogical because I have a good job and lots of fun social commitments so I shouldn't complain. 

But I do. The stress makes me bitter and angry, self-pitying, and resentful of other people. It makes me convinced I've been treated unfairly by people, very entitled, like I'm owed something by everyone. 

For example at work I'm pissed off if I'm not given enough responsibility, because they evidently don't trust me. When they then do give me responsibility I'm pissed off at them because they won't give me enough support because they evidently don't care about me. 

You get the picture. This makes me an irritating and bitter person to know, who's always complaining about his terrible but fictional situation, and who blames everyone for the way he feels. I complain about things that I totally have the power to fix, like having a busy diary, making me even more annoying to people as they can't offer a solution to make me shut up. This makes other people annoyed, upset and defensive, so it pushes people away from me.   

The trouble is I genuinely feel it - I honestly feel powerless to fix my busy diary that gives me little time to relax, I honestly feel like work both doesn't trust me and doesn't care about me, and it is very hard to wish those feelings away. Everything upsets me and none of it feels like my fault, but my attitude pushes people away from this. 

Has anyone ever experienced this and do they have any ideas at how not to be so entitled or angry?

11,"For a while I was a chain smoker, and I stopped smoking recently because of paranoia and panic attacks I would get when I was high, I often felt like things that didn’t happen would happen, an example would be when watching the ID channel and falling asleep i would wake up high thinking I murdered someone and freaking out, and I had serious memory loss, I don’t know what to do because I constantly feel out of control and that any minute cops will come running through my door, I have a horrible time sleeping because I will also have extremely vivid nightmares, and to be honest I don’t know If I murdered anyone or not, This has been scaring me for months and taking a serious toll on my mental health, what do I do?",02Feb2020,1
12,"Disclaimer: I have incredibly bad OCD mixed with depression and subtle anxiety. I think I’m starting to figure out how to beat it without medication. I’m 27 years old and I’ve dealt with this my entire life


So I recently started repeating mantras everyday and 
my life is getting better and better. I repeat different “I am affirmations” hundreds of times a day and now I feel good and I don’t know why. It’s like my OCD is starting to become a super power because I’m harnessing it’s intense energy. It used to be feeling bad for no reason but now I feel genuinely good. I still have bad days but now I make the conscious effort to speak highly of myself even when I don’t want too. Mamba mentality. Speaking highly of yourself enables you to replace those habitual negative thoughts with positive ones. Eventually your mind is just going to bring the positive out of every situation. Remember that we are supposed to be happy, life is supposed to be FUN. Don’t let your parents, friends or the media tell you any different. You are a creator of your own reality and you CAN control your thoughts. It’s just like working out a muscle so just practice positive thinking everyday and you will be mind blown by the results within the first month. 

Since I’ve become aware that entertaining a negative thought is a choice, I’ve gained so much liberty with the thoughts I choose to think about. Staying sad/miserable is easy, but so can being happy. You don’t need an experience to feel something - you can feel prosperous and live in abundance before it actually manifests. It’s all about the thoughts you choose. Thoughts become beliefs and then that becomes our reality. So start believing that you are worthy of greatness, that you have everything in abundance, that you live a life of prosperity and love. Don’t say “I want to feel blah blah blah” or “I wish I had blah blah blah” say “I AM” Like I said I STILL HAVE BAD DAYS, but it’s different now. Once I started to change the things I think about, the things I looked at changed. I can literally look at a piece of poop and see so much beauty in it. 

I know I know; this sounds so cliché but the most effective ways of life/phrases are usually cliché


You’re thoughts are like a radio tuner. Just tune to the frequency that you want (thought or belief) and then put all of your focus on that. Visualize it and see it happening over and over again. Don’t worry about “how” it will happen. Don’t put it on a pedestal and most importantly have FUN. I’ll leave it at this...BELIEVE

17,So I’m 13 and I’ve recently been diagnosed with anxiety. My mom is the one who knew and got help for me as she deals with anxiety and depression to and she wanted me to get help as soon as possible the thing is she is telling the psychiatrist that she sees her anxiety in me but not her depression. I don’t know if I’m depressed as I’m not a professional but I don’t just worry about stuff. I often think I’m a failure and worthless and I have thoughts about ending my life and I keep telling myself it would hurt my family so don’t do it because they’ll be hurt if I do. I also feel like I have no energy a lot. I’ve also went through something last year where I visibly was losing weight and I don’t want to admit this but before I started losing weight I had been saying I was fat and had to lose weight to myself and even though I wasn’t exactly aware I was eating less at the time when my mom started saying I was losing weight and I wouldn’t eat anything I realized it and I was like sh*t I got to stop because my brothers were having trouble with their mental health at the time and I didn’t want to give my mom more stress. So I stopped eating less and tried to be normal again even though I’m unhappy with my weight. Last year I was going through a lot as well as I was stopping going to school because of my mental health and me and my parents were fighting a lot causing me to start self harming as it took the emotional pain away in a way. It was really hard to stop but I knew I had to the night I felt so bad that I just didn’t care and cut so much my arm burned for hours and I had over 30 cuts. When my psychiatrist asked me if I ever had thoughts about ending my life or harming myself or if I had harmed myself I said no I just couldn’t bring myself to say it knowing how much my mom would feel destroyed knowing how bad I was hurting. And I always had these thoughts and feelings because I was always bullied and that’s why I stopped going to school it was just to much when people stared at me like I wasn’t human.

20,"I’ve been dealing with this rumor that a popular guy told a girl, and the girl told other guys, and now the rumor has gotten around. I’m now a senior in high school and the rumor started last year when I was a junior. My life was perfect before.

The rumor is that I’m a male to female transgender and that I have a penis. I am a female and was born a female.

It has ruined any possible friendships I could’ve formed with males at my school and I often hear people whispering about me. 

A couple weeks ago, I heard this guy saying “trans, trans, trans” around his friends when I was walking past them. 

I often wear a fanny pack now because the little bulge thingy on the zipper that shows up when I wear jeans just fuels the rumors. 

Actually, my teacher fueled the rumors Friday when I said “here” quietly during attendance and she said “that wasn’t your voice, it sounded too deep!” And went on to make a deep, masculine sounding voice to mimick me. And you already know how this is gonna turn out Monday.

This rumor is just ruining my life and making me feel suicidal. No one wants to talk to me other than the friends I already have now, and I can’t believe people believe this rumor.

24,"Hi so me (27f) and my husband (26m) have been married for almost two years now..

We both have struggled with our mental health. I started really having problems and was kind of pushed into seeking out outside help. I started seeing a therapist, eventually got a psychiatrist and have been working through my problems. 

My husband on the other hand has not. He’d go to therapy casually, listen to what the therapist had to say; but never applied anything. He was even prescribed a low dose of Zoloft for depression and anxiety. He’s completely stopped going and making his own mental health a priority. 

It has seriously started to affect our relationship. A few months after we got married he became so cold towards me. He stopped “dating” me. Yes I know relationships go through it and marriage is very different but I can’t even get him to be affectionate towards me unless it’s his terms.

He only is sweet to me when he wants to be intimate. Sex is always on his terms..in fact everything is. 

I decided to bring up some of these things I was noticing and he completely shut me down. He said he’s not happy, and I said yeah with me and he said no it’s “not you”. He said he doesn’t feel any emotions or anything at all. 

He made some joke about wanting to do it and I said no I’m not really in the mood right now. He got annoyed and I’ll admit I snapped at him. I said that maybe if he spent some quality time with me, took me out, and when I’m not feeling well I shouldn’t have to beg him to comfort me..then I’d be more willing to have sex with him. 

He threw a fit and told me he’s not doing therapy and refuses to work on himself. So am I just supposed to accept the fact that I’m married to someone who refuses to put their mental health first and is a complete jerk to me.",02Feb2020,1

I hate myself for maybe like 3 to 4 years(still do) and I'm bad at dealling with stress/talking about how I feel and I'm a isolated introvert. (Have no friends)
2 days ago I got a girl next to me into trouble because she tried to explain the task(maths) to me and teacher saw her and yelled at her...if only I didn't look like an idiot then maybe she wouldn't have gotten into trouble...
I can still feel happiness(like when you buy a game and play it) but after an hour it just feels...empty.
I can laugh at something and after a couple of moments feel empty.
Tbh, since my tics calmed a bit my mental health has beed pretty solid...but not it just keeps going down...
I feel like a failure, I'm even starting to hate my existance.
I feel like I can't trust anyone...like I was backstabed because teachers won't help me and my mum tells me to ignore it...
I may be over reacting...but I feel cornered...
Maybe these problems will just go away...at least I hope it will.
And I can't see a psychologist(not even sure if my school even has one) or a psychiatrist without a good reasson so I decided to just vent a bit here.
I just wanted to create this post to see how this situation looks from a different point of view.

Anyway, thanks for reading.",02Feb2020,1

28,"Me (24m) and my ex (23f) just broke up 2 days ago. She suffers from depression, bipolar disorder, and severe anxiety. She went from being all for our relationship and being happy to her wanting to go down to the train. Tracks every day to wait for a train to kill her. I have worried about her every single day since we have broken up. I told her how much she means to me and that I will be there for her if/when she needs someone. She just kind of shoved it to the side and told me "" I wish people wouldn't care for me so much so it would make me killing myself easier"". I am terrified that I am going to get a call from her parents saying she has passed away. I tried to tell her parents about how serious the situation is, but they are all like "" oh this has happened in the past and it will blow over."" 

She told me she went to her therapist and that the therapist said that she does not need therapy. They just want her to continue with her current prescription of anti-depression medicine. I fear maybe she did not tell them the truth or is not wanting to. She tells me she still loves me as a friend but just needs time to figure stuff out with herself. I'm not really asking for relationship advice, more so how do I make sure she is safe. What can I do to help. It has even begun to effect my mental health as well.",02Feb2020,1

For some context I'm 16 years old and just got into my first senior year, while we were walking back from church my parents noticed that I had grown a grey hair. Being the supportive and wonderful parents that they are they asked me if I was stressed or had some problems. I answered no, which I thought was the truth but as we were walking back I suddenly had to hold back tears, I got a lump in my throat and for around 3 hours afterwards I started thinking some very negative thoughts. Now I feel absolutely fine, happy even so I'm just very confused about where this all came from. My life is going well, I have great friends, a wonderful supportive family, school is going fine but sometimes I have these random emotional outbursts (this wasn't the first time).

31,"Hi, I'm looking for a little bit of help regarding accessing behavioural health therapy. I currently live in Arizona and am under my parent's insurance. I am seeking therapy for mental health and did talk to my PCP about it who gave me a referral. Unfortunately after talking to clinic it seemed to be about $97 per appointment, which is not affordable for me at the moment. I did ask for another referral however she said there was only 1 other available clinic that accepts my insurance plan and their price was even higher. I did discuss the cost with them, but they did not offer any sort of assistance. I was hoping if the cost was not high so I would be able to cover it myself without my parents finding out. I've been doing a little more reading and realized that they can access all of the information about the healthcare I receive under their insurance. I do not want them to know/they would not be supportive of me seeking therapy so I was looking at options for self pay. It looks like you have to state your insurance if you have one or you are committing insurance fraud which I obviously do not want to do. I also heard they then do not offer sliding scale/assistance for costs. I tried looking up university clinics/cheaper options, but I can't seem to find any that are available to non students. The university does offer $15 counseling appointments which would have been great, but I'm no longer a student. I was wondering if there is anyway I can have the best of both worlds with affordable services and not have it listed on insurance for my parents to see?

33,"So the first time I smoked I was 9 years old, it was with my older brother and I don't really remember much from that night. 

*Fast Forward* 

Summer or 2018: I start smoking everyday with my mother, I enjoyed being high and soon realized that when I was high I died have panic/anxiety attack's and wasn't afraid to go places. I had agreed to stop smoking once school started due to me being randomly drug tested because I am in marching band. I did stop smoking for about 6-7 weeks then realized that I was not okay whenever I didn't use it. (NOTE: I was not addicted to it, I put it down multiple times because I wanted to see if I could quit. And I could, I just was a much calmer person when I could use every night) so I started using again until my mom found out by searching my room. I was then forced to quit because mom had her eyes on me. 

*Summer of 2019* 

Started working and spent a good amount of my money on weed. So I stayed high most of the time, school started and I was not going to school high or letting anyone know my business. I started dating a girl who also smoked, but her parents are super strict and religious so they ended up finding out that she was smoking. They forced her to turn herself into the school, now them putting 2 and 2 together they figured since she smoked and I probably did as well. I was called into a ""random"" drug test and failed for weed. I now am not able to march in band (which is the main thing that keeps me calm) and now I'm very depressed. I know that I did it to myself and there is nothing I can do about it now but I'm considering dropping out because I am barely passing my classes, I can't march, and I don't really want to keep going and almost breaking down everyday. I really don't know what to do.",02Feb2020,1

Like a lot of people in this world I have depression and anxiety and, fortunately, I was recently diagnosed. That being said I think the most limiting part of my depression in my incessant need to not be outwardly expressive about who I actually am inside. What I mean by that is that is I feel like I have created this version of myself that everyone sees as kinda like a “straightforward dude” if that makes any sense. And obviously I have people that I feel I can be honest with like my sister and my friends but I find it the most challenging thing in the world to just be myself around most people.

I've heard several times that high-functioning mental disorders\*, such as BPD and autism spectrum ones, are often omitted when consulting a psychologist as the diagnosis often carries a stigma and the disorder\* doesn't affect as much the other's life.

I'm asking if this is true because, despite having a SAD diagnosis, some of my behaviours are quite unusual in a mental health way. Such as getting easily upset, having an extreme reaction from that and quickly jumping to regret such reaction, which often includes crying in a way that surely doesn't match my age. Still, my therapist only focused on how there isn't much I can do to avoid such, and all I can do is to avoid situations that make me like that. That often made me wonder if she was overlooking important information about my mental health. But I remembered about hearing some choose to omit some diagnoses, and thought if that was true I don't need to worry much.

Some extremely condensed background...I’ve struggled this past year with a couple of traumatic experiences. My sister swallowed an entire bottle of pills earlier this year and was involuntarily committed. Because of her struggles, mine are often often brushed off by my family because they’re “not bad” in comparison. I’ve been really having a hard time coping with this, and trying desperately to get to a therapist but my needs are being put on the back burner.

So, that being said, my boyfriend and I decided to unwind about a week ago with some edibles. His mom joined us, and at first all was well. But then she started to “not feel good” - she got up to go to the bathroom and just collapsed suddenly. We sat her up and she insisted she had to go to the bathroom so we let her...she was taking too long...stopped responding to our knocks and questions. I went in and what I saw was truly terrifying. Her head was bent back and she was struggling to breathe. Her face was pale and lips blue. I screamed and tried sitting her up and shaking her and she slumped forward. I held her because I didn’t know what else to do. He called 911. I was high and terrified. She seemed like she stopped breathing and I honestly thought she was dead for a moment there. She came back to consciousness and the paramedics came and ultimately took her but I couldn’t calm down and was shaking for hours and hours. It was the scariest experience of my life, albeit one I would have handled much better had I been sober. (Note: the medical situation was a fluke unrelated to the edibles, but that was necessary for accuracy of the story)

Am I insane? the end of it all seems so peaceful, no longer creating a life to make someone else happy. What is my own happiness? Any thought I shoot down internally, the voice in my head is the worst critic of them all, constantly in the spotlight, constantly in fear, never a chance for peace. Mum you showed me life is a gift but I feel I can't control it, I'm so inept at anything, how can anyone do anything in life and be happy? Get a job, grind it out, show up everyday, even if you hate it, you know there's kids in Africa who slave in the mines for cents a day, yet I'm too much of a fuck wit to even use the head start I have to do anything. So what's the point? If I could trade places with them I would, they deserve to have this, not me. Trade and then end it all, give someone the opportunity to use a gift I was given, give it to someone who knows how to use it. I've had enough of this feeling, carrying a wight that gets heavier every day, what a fucking waste. I hate my job, I hate it so much I've thought about killing myself to escape, what kind of coward kills himself to escape a job, the type who fears the faces of those who trust him to be something he's not. I'm supposed to be someone who has it figured out, who has a job that he worked for, who made decisions, who is purposeful, I can't tell you how far from the truth I am from all of that. I'm lost. I love those who love me, I will never kill myself because it would hurt them too much, I'm not worried what it would do to me, I only care what it would do to them and I could never be the reason for such pain. So I lie in limbo, waiting for an end, towing the line, living in dread, as I have many days before, as I will for the rest to come.",02Feb2020,1
60,"I had tests done and there is no physical explanation for my symptoms. I feel like it's so incredibly hard to concentrate, I experience lower capacity when it comes to memorizing or recalling. My therapist (and the neurologist) suspect pseudo -dementia due to my years of depression and other mental health problems. Anybody else experience this? Is in treatment?

61,"Hey guys, so I'm going to make this short. 

A year or so ago, my family issues were horrible. I dont want to talk about it but my family became very abusive and toxic towards me, I remember having a mental breakdown every day in the toilet and thinking about dying. I was then diagnosed with anxiety (which hasn't gone away). One day, I was crying so much that there were no tears left, dry and painful crying. Then all of a sudden I couldn't feel it anymore, I couldn't feel the sadness or really any emotion. I seriously felt almost blunt. Numb. It's been getting a little better, I can get sad but I never cry, I can however get very angry, I can get happy but not easily, and I cant feel excitement full stop. All I think is 'I'll get through today'. I have a few friends, but none that really care about me. I like to socialize sometimes but the thought of it gives me a lot of anxiety. 

What's wrong with me and how can I start to feel again? I'm sick of this absolutely dull feeling. The only time that I cry is when I create scenarios in my head where all my family is dead except from me and I'm alone, they feel so real and I cant stop them.",02Feb2020,1

63,"Okay so I’m 17. I have always had anxiety and I obviously knew it but I have just recently became worse and aware. It is usually in social situations where it gets really bad. I have anxiety with what I am going to do with my life because I have such bad anxiety I quit 3 jobs because of out I feel while working and also I would zone out and not understand thing. I’m almost positive I have dissociation. But I am confused. It tends to bother me A LOT when I am in class. I kind of go into this paralyzed feeling and I get stuck in a staring or trance like state and my mind goes blank completely which I think also happens due to extreme anxiety and I get nervous that other people can notice so I stare at the teacher while she’s lecturing but I’m not really there. It’s like I am wearing foggy glasses That are stuck to my face. But this is where it gets confusing and weird for me... legitimately ALL the time 24/7 I feel zoned out. I cant seem to think of anything and when I do.. I can’t seem to keep the thought in my head for very long sometimes. When I am in the car and I am not driving EVERY single time, I will kind of like “open my eyes” and realize where we are and I will not remember a single goddamn thing of the drive and like stuff then I go back to doing it. The thing that is irritating me tho lately is that I can’t remember much of anything anymore in my past. I used to. And I know I used to but now it’s like so difficult to remember hardly anything from even just a year ago. It is like my brain has slowed down and stopped working properly. 

If anyone needs any background on me that could’ve “caused” these issues I legit cannot think of anything from my childhood but I these : I abused drugs but it was for a short period of time, probably 5 months the longest. Usually it was xanax or coke and weed or ecstasy. I did it with my boyfriend that I have been with for 2 years. I also went though some bad experiences for about a week ONLY a week, where me and my boyfriend were emotionally unstable and would get into unreasonable arguments mainly because we were using drugs and he abused me I guess. Example : He has thrown me out of a chair, punched me in my eye/nose but in his defense I was threatening to throw a lamp at him, and at one point the worst moment was when we were on drugs arguing and I took about 7 blows to the head and I just covered my head and cried to sleep. But as soon as we stopped using drugs, this all stopped.",02Feb2020,1

It’s very strange. I’ve kind of always had these thoughts since I was younger but on a 1-10 scale, when I was younger it was like a 2 and in the past year it’s like an 8-9. 

Idk how to explain the way I feel. I just look at my boyfriend and think, wow he’s really by boyfriend huh? Or I look at my daughter and I’m like oh fuck I really had a child what the hell and she looks just like me.

70," I've had this situation for years now before I started college. It's hard to explain and I feel embarrassed about it's the first time it's ever left my mind  but basically, I have always had strange coping choices that have helped me alot but I'm not sure where I developed them and I feel very embarrassed that I have them I was wondering of anyone had this to a similar or same extent. Basically I have had this method that to cope with being put down in life I have had to develop scenarios and people in my mind that are usually being projected as people that I know, where I'm falling apart and that person that I'm projecting it on is kind to me and practically takes care of me. It's not even like partners or just being kind but more like I'm a child they have that is seriously struggling with life and has been through alot that has effected them.

I have used this every night for years and in the day where, they are practically taking care of me when I'm in fear feel down or feel like I'm falling apart when I'm in bed it's automatic that it's like I'm a child and I sleep next to them to feel comfort from it.

These are always females that I tend to have an attraction to not just as liking them but more feel safe around them.

74,"I hope I don’t come off as sexist towards men or anything but hear me out:

     So I’m a 21 year old straight male and I don’t know what’s wrong with me.  When I was young I was diagnosed with ADD.  But now I’m starting to think that there might be other things I have as well because of the other problems I’ve been having, including anxiety, compulsions, panic attacks, etc.
     
     Anyways, for some reason I’d rather talk to a female about this than a male.  I hate to sound sexist but I can’t fix the fact that it just feels more comfortable opening up to a woman than a man.  I’ve had a few friends in high school that I hung out with a few times and they were all females.  I still talk to a few of them on Snapchat but I haven’t hung out with any of them for awhile because of my anxiety and social awkwardness.  I also have one sibling(my sister) that I’m pretty close with.  I don’t know if me being more around women has anything to do with it but I think it’s a possibility.
     
     So if I see a psychiatrist or someone that I can open up to, I would hope it’s a woman because it feels much easier for some reason.  I’ve never tried talking to any guys because it seems like they lack any interest in the “emotional stuff”.  I’m not saying that men wouldn’t care or anything but I just don’t feel very comfortable talking to one about my mental health issues, even if he was a professional.

     Anyone know a reason behind this or not?  

I would also appreciate it if there’s any advice you could give me on seeking help for my mental health issues.  Thanks!",02Feb2020,1
75,"TW: talk of suicide/self harm 

So last night I walked into an Emergency room and told them that I’m suicidal, I can’t keep myself safe anymore, and that I’d been self harming. The security guard took my razor blades from me. They only kept me for three hours. The put an IV in my arm that they didn’t use. They gave me a tetanus shot. Each nurse that treated me asked me to recount exactly why I was there, in detail. They asked a lot of personal and violating questions, and didn’t seem to write any of my answers down? They had me strip and put on a gown in front of a male nurse, after I requested a female nurse. They sent a clinician in that asked me all of same questions as the last five nurses and then she lectured me on being too dependent on other people because “it’s not healthy for them either.” She then printed out a couple papers with suicide hotlines and access to homeless shelters (I’m not homeless. I never told anyone I was homeless) and told me I was ‘good to go’.
The male nurse came in to take out my IV and said ‘Okay. Off like a bandaid!’, grabbed the tape and RIPPED it out of my arm. I didn’t even get discharge papers with my lab results. 
Here’s the real kicker: when I was leaving, the security guard asked me if I wanted my razor blades back. 

————-

Fast forward to today. 
I spent hours self harming today. I slit both my wrists in my bathtub and came very close to drowning myself. 
A loving friend said some extremely kind things to me and asked me to try again. One more time. 
So I came to a crisis center that deals specifically with mental/behavioral health. 
After a bit of a wait, ONE PERSON evaluated me. Told me that she can’t fix everything, but that they’re going to do a lot to help. And encouraged me to file a grievance against the previous hospital. She promised that when I leave I’ll get a case manager and they’ll get me continued therapy. And that no one will hand me my razor blades back😭
I’ll be stayed here for five days, with individual and group therapy. My boyfriend and dog will be allowed to visit me and hug me.

76,"I listened to a talk between a psychiatrist and one of their clients and client's problem really seems to resemble my own problem.  I apologize if this isn't the correct place to post this. 

I'm 26M.  So, I've been in college for about 8.5 years (5.5 years at community college, 3 years at my current university) projected to graduate this May.  I don't remember exactly when but probably during junior high, and moreso in high school, a habit manifested in me where if things got ""difficult"" for me in my classes, I'd default to half-assing those specific classes (AP/honors) and just spend my time after school playing video games, maybe because if I failed in games, it'd be okay because I could keep trying and getting better and essentially it feels like theres no ceiling for what I could accomplish for putting my all into video games.  So, fast forward to college and basically a shit show happens during my community college years, extending my time there to 5.5 years(from 2-3 years).  I get into my first semester courses, get mediocre grades because I refused to do homework in my tougher classes and, again, would spend all my time after class playing video games.  Then, it got worse to the point where I was failing my hardest classes (which were multi-variable calculus and calculus-based physics during that period) and re-taking them multiple times, putting in the same low amount of effort.  I'd always tell myself ""I'm going to work my ass off and get an A"" only to fall back to the same vicious cycle.

I transfer to university and the deep regret I had in my failures as a student (and as a person) essentially fueled me to work harder and my grades drastically got better.  However, I still fall back to the same stupid cycle a few times here (failed basically the two hardest courses of my degree because I refused to try).  I want to change.  I realize this is my problem now and I want to be able to put in 100% effort, regardless of the outcome.",02Feb2020,1
77,"Last year was the worst year of my entire life. I got injured back in November 2018. Then, my brother crashed my car and it was total loss but he was okay. Then, I lost my job because the injury got worse and worse. My injury made my back look crooked and that brought down my self esteem so low that every time I looked at the mirror, I cried. I did not like the person I was looking at; I looked horrible and weak. I used to be this energetic  girl who was working and going to school full time, traveling, dating around and just having the time of my life. Seeing myself in the mirror so weak, broke my heart to million pieces. 

I had a successful surgery on September because I'm back to normal. MY BACK IS NOT CROOKED ANYMORE! I still have some pain but I don't pay attention to it anymore. 

Well, my friends and I cooked dinner today and we had a little reunion. You guys have no idea how much I laughed. It's been an hour since I left and my stomach and my throat still hurt because of how much I laughed. I used to be this girl who would make other people laugh and seeing that girl today just made me so happy. It made me realize that not everything's lost and just because I had a tough year, doesn't mean it's gonna be like that for the rest of my life.

I came home and I found my parents hugging each other and as soon as they saw me, they ran towards me and hugged me. And my mom instantly said: You have no idea how much we love you *mi amor.* Then, they both gave me a kiss on the forehead and I simply started crying of happiness.

81,"I went to a 'networking event' the other night, only had 4 glasses of wine but I'm pretty small and a lightweight (25/F). Headed home with a friend - we live in college campus accommodation.

He made it back to his room but I was stopped on the way in and deemed 'incredibly intoxicated'. I had honestly been fine up until that point but I guess it all hit me pretty hard on the way home.

Campus security basically decided I needed to go to hospital to be checked out, but I insisted I was fine and just wanted to head to my room. They eventually relented and escorted me to my room, but not without telling my roommate about the incident and instructing her to take care of me. (For context, it's a building housing only grad students and professors, so drinking is not forbidden).

Obviously my roommate was furious and kept asking me what drugs I had taken, not believing me when I told her I hadn't. Once I thought she had gone to bed, I decided to avoid the tension by heading to a friend's room on a different floor (he invited me over). Unfortunately he had changed room recently, so a Resident Assistant then found me on a different floor waiting for him to text me back, she definitely did not believe me that I was meeting someone so brought me back to my floor. FINALLY got in touch with my friend, went to his and vented/recovered from the incident.

The next day I got an email from the Residential Services with an 'account' of the night before and checking that I was okay. I responded but they are out of office for the weekend. I also emailed the Resident Assistant in question and she was super nice about everything.

ANYWAY I'm completely freaking out. The past two days I haven't left my room because I'm too scared to face my roommate, let alone the building security guys on front desk. I'm literally petrified but this can't go on forever. I can't believe this all escalated so fast over a few glasses of wine.

85,"I'm gonna start saying my native language's not English, so sorry if I mess anything up. This ended up being very long, so I'm highlighting the parts that actually require medical advice, but I would really appreciate it if you could read it and help me with anything at all.

And then I'm going to actually start by saying that I'm not 100% sure that I'm BPD as of now. I've been diagnosed some years ago (after much arguing with doctors that never seem to be by my side), but my recent behavior (and if I look deep into it, pretty much all of my life) has given me strong feelings that I'm bipolar.

I don't really know how to start this, and it's probably going to be long, but I really would appreciate some help. I'm going to try and sum it up. We're in January and I've already been to the hospital because of a suicide attempt. I thought this year was supposed to be different. After being admitted to a mental institution sometime last year and having to drop college because of it, I changed psychiatrists. My last psychiatrist didn't take me seriously and, honestly, I'm sorry, it's hard writing this because I'm so emotional about everything and it makes me really mad, so I'm just going to use some bad words if you allow me. She was a fucking bitch. I was literally almost dying because of depression but she wouldn't change my medication or give me what I asked for, for almost 1 year (Lithium), because she was afraid that my ""perfect skin"" was going to be fucked up. Honestly. After being to the mental institution, and let me make a little pause here, because, I live in Brazil, in a not-so-poor-but-still-miserable city, and the mental institution was literally fucking hell. I thought I was going to die, I swear. It looked like a prison, it felt like a prison, it smelt like a prison. Fuck. It makes me teary just thinking about it. I don't want to ever go back to that absolute shithole.

But the shithole had a very good and kind psychiatrist, and we decided to switch psychiatrists and stay with her. I've been with her for around 6 months, and I wanna say I'm better but things just keep getting worse for me, so I don't really know. But I can see she's very smart and she actually knows what she's doing. She's prescribed me Lamictal, Lithium, Pamelor, and I don't really remember all the names but I'm also taking Xanax for 5 years now and she didn't try to change that yet because I'm obviously addicted and the withdrawal would probably fuck me up and I don't have the strength for that right now.

**My new psychiatrist recommended I start a new therapy, which was initially only EMDR because I have an awful lot of trauma and repressed memories. I went to the therapist and it turns out she's also a CBT therapist. I mistook CBT for DBT (which is the one that's good for bipolar or BPD folks like me, correct me if I'm wrong). So, the first session was absolutely fucking disastrous shit. I thought the therapist was honestly a bitch and she wouldn't help me or give me advice, it was a really strange and uncomfortable experience, but everyone's telling me I should go some more times before I decide it's bad. The therapy actually made me feel like a fucking mess yesterday and I felt really bad, and some repressed memories and events came up to my mind, and it was 2 or 3 AM and it was unbearable. But maybe that's what's it's supposed to do? Please enlighten me. I need to know what to expect, what to tell her, how to react, I don't know. Please just help me if you have any advice or experience with similar events.** I'm honestly so lost. I've been in this hole for 5 years and it's gotten to the point where I don't even know if I can kill myself, so I don't try anymore, but if I had a chance I'd probably take it. I'm so afraid of going back to that absolute shithole or having to spend the rest of my life bedridden by this goddamned sickness. Sorry. It's just really hard to write this. I'm at my limit.

&amp;#x200B;

**So, second part. I had an OD on Xanax, Lamictal, and Klonopin (a lot) and almost died some weeks ago. I couldn't eat afterward for an entire week because I'd throw everything up and I had to go back to the hospital. My dad is a doctor and he discussed some possibilities with my psychiatrist, and it probably was either a serotonin syndrome or lithium overdose (even though I didn't take lithium on the suicide attempt, I got dehydrated and the proportion of Lithium in my body got messed up). Nevertheless, after that, my psychiatrist changed my doses and I'm also taking Pamelor now. I've been having an unwanted side effect. I searched a little bit about it, and it seems that there are no psychiatrical meds that can increase your libido. But that's what happened to me. I usually masturbated once or twice a week, but now I have to do it at least 6 times a day or I go crazy. I feel like I have even less control over myself, and my sexual parts literally hurt when I touch them because it's been awful, and I also have some bad memories of having sexual relationships and it makes me feel extremely uncomfortable watching porn. Can someone give me advice on that too? I'd really, really appreciate it.**

I'm really sorry this is so long and probably very confusing. I'm desperate. I'm 20. I've had this fucking shit since I was 15 and not all meds in the world seem to be able to control it. It just got worse. And it's not like anything really bad is happening. My trauma is just, in the past. But it just gets worse. And I feel like sometimes I'm really happy and up and I could do anything in the world but all of sudden the depression creeps in and it's so unbearable and it lasts so long. And I've been in this cycle for 5 years and you could tell me all the names of meds you know and I'd tell you, I've taken every single one. And it always changes after some time or a crisis and I always hope it's going to be the last time, but it never is. I'm really fucking tired, so I'd just really appreciate some help. I'm really sorry. I've lost all good opportunities that were given to me, I've lost a scholarship for college in Japan, I dropped out of college in my city because I literally couldn't take it, and I've hurt so many people. And I keep thinking the longer I'm alive the more people I'm going to meet and therefore hurt if I die. So isn't now the best time for suicide? Because things will just get worse with time. I'm sorry this ended up as just meaningless venting but I could really appreciate some advice. Thank you so very much.",02Feb2020,1

87,"Hey Everyone, 
As a heads up, this post only really applies to inpatient mental health workers and/or residential counselors. I was recently sent this survey (https://williamjames.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_77is6d3CdImrIMZ) via a mental health email listserv that I am a part of. Unfortunately, I don't meet the participation criteria, but it seemed pretty interesting and I figured I should pass it along to another community. The topic is burnout, and how exposure to violence on inpatient units impacts mental health workers/direct care staff. I thought that some individuals who are members of this sub might meet the criteria, and might be interested in helping this guy out. If you're able to participate, I'm sure it would be much appreciated. If not, feel free to pass the survey onto other individuals who qualify.

89,"Since around halfway through November I’ve been feeling off and I didn’t really know how to properly word what I was feeling until about a month ago. I’ve decided the best way to explain it is that I don’t feel like me. I know I have to be me because who else could I be but I really feel like a different person. 
It’s similar to how I imagine Wanda feels from The Host, where she’s in control of Melanie’s body and what Melanie says and feels, but she knows that they’re two different people. The big difference is that I don’t know who I am if I’m not me.
It’s not a matter of feeling like I’m a guy in a girl’s body or anything like that, I just feel really disconnected from my name and even my own thoughts. I thought I’d reach out and see if this is something other people have experienced and if anyone knew what I was feeling.

If anything’s confusing lmk and I’ll try to explain better, thanks.",02Feb2020,1

This is an awful feeling. It’s been going on for years, and nothing helps me. It’s hurts more because of my loneliness. No one really cares, I get ghosted or they just stop talking to me. It hurts too that society sees someone like me, (a self harmer for many years) as a freak.

I’m just trying to find the love of my life and be happy. But apparently that’s too much to ask. I’m not “worthy” enough To girls to try to build up courage to talk to. But other guys can just instantly get any girls number and it seems like I’m the only one who can’t love anyone. But those guys just want sex and nothing more. I’ve always wanted a real relationship, sometime to share your feelings with, to hold each other while the horrible world around you rages on. But I’m just seen as “thirsty” or “cringy”. 

I wouldn’t blame anyone who reads this if they didn’t try and help me, I understand truly I do. I’d be surprised if someone even made it this far. Because I know that I sound like the most typical, by the numbers “good” guy. But I don’t have really any other way to express my emotions other than cutting myself. It’s all built up, and I have no release anywhere in my life. Nothing helps😔. 

It’s really sad too, because I tried to kill myself when I was 17 and I was thrown into a hospital. It was awful. But at least it wasn’t long. I kept the wrist band I wore ever since, every now and then I gaze at it in remorse and ponder about how my life was so different back then. That was only 2 years ago though it feels like a lifetime. 

I just want love. Honest and wholesome love.

My parents were divorced before I was old enough to gaf. I am so very thankful for their separation because at least I got a chance to a experience dosages of a loving healthy household when I would visit my mother growing up. 

As far as I know, my grandfather (father's father) passed away in his sleep when my dad was a young kid and I honestly believe that has damaged him as a person. He used to beat the shit out of me and physically intimidate me as punishment growing up. Things like talking back to an adult, not saying ""yes sir"" ""no sir"", or getting sub par grades would bring a world of shit my way.. Once I remember I was about 8 years old and my dad hosted a small gathering for his friends. It was a nice summer day, no drama, just good music and vibes. His 1960s muscle car (his pride and joy) was sitting in front of the house in the driveway all day that day. Later that evening I get called into his bedroom where he told me that he knows about the scratch. I thought WHAT FUCKING SCRATCH?! I knew nothing about the scratch.. Nope, he wasnt trying to hear that, I got beat. Belts, slaps, and fists.. 

Trips to my mom's was always my escape.. I remember times I would cry when I would get dropped back off back home after a long weekend or holiday with her. My dad would yell at me for crying..

Around my 10th birthday, he introduced his hidden family to the family if that makes sence.. he had a 3year old daughter (my half sister) and a  girlfriend. I was a little weird about the situation, but overall ok with it. Through the years as I grew older, I started to really feel like the outcast of the household. I would continue to get beat and yelled at, while my half sister never recieved any of that treatment for punishment (I'm not saying I wish she did! But it made me feel singled out). I turned to drugs and alcohol in highschool as an escape. I'm ashamed today to say that I grew to resent HER for it.. we are estranged to this day actually. Weddings and funerals is all we ever really speak..

He beat me when I was 17 for not holding a door open for his gf. This time I ran away and I called the cops.. after several months of back and forwarth, my mom was awarded custody of me. Thank God.

.... I learned about a year ago from a ""feelings Doc"" that I have ADHD/ADD... All those bad grades as a kid, ""Not listening"", all that shit was something I had no control over. I'm in tears as I'm writing this..

96,"Hey,

The last couple of months, i’ve been feeling my mental health has been deteriorating. When I dont have to do anything important, I sleep way too much and find it almost impossible to get out of sleep. I occasionally mildly wake up, however still not fully concious, and fall right back to sleep and start dreaming often quite intense dreams. However, I also experience quite severe sleep issues, especially the days before having to go to university, where I almost dont sleep at all. I am extremely irritable, and whenever I go out or meet with friends or go out in public in general, I want to snap at everyone and feel angry and feel very unease. I find the most simple tasks extremely daunting, and can’t collect the mental energy to do them. Just by going to university or the gym, already drags all my energy out for that day. I often feel anxious about other people, and have a very hard time trusting people outside of my family. Most things I usually enjoy seem extremely boring or uninteresting, except for the simple task of playing video games, which sometimes can make me feel slightly better. In addition to all of this, I feel paranoid, and often feel either people are malicious towards me, or judging me. It quite literally can make me feel sometimes, that I am going completely insane. I live in the Northern hemisphere, and right now it is very dark, and I did find some benefits when the sun is shining, to sit in my window and take it in, but it only mildly improves my day.

I’ve been experiencing these things, ever since I had a very chaotic end of a relationship with my BPD ex girlfriend. Since then, I started seeing someone new, but I am completely numb to show her any feelings or empathy. However, she still sticks through for some reason, but its very hard for me to show her any affection. I think also, recently i’ve had an exam period and got an internship, which also added a lot of stress to my life and made everything a little more chaotic.

I decided to be very self-reflective about this, since I have a brother that suffers from bipolar disorder type 2. I talk to him very often, and might talk with him about this soon, as he is very good at understanding such things just from his own experience and interest. I have been considering going to a proffessional maybe, but I would like to know if any of what i’m telling seems out of the ordinary for any of you, because I feel like I am suffering and can’t do what i’m supposed to do because of it...

He was hospitalized in December of 2019 and was there for 22 days while they observed him. The diagnosis was anxiety specifically OCD and they gave him medication which as of today does not seem to be working. He is in the process of starting a new school that has doctors on its staff to look over the children that have medical needs like he currently does and we are hoping this will result in more clarity and some sort of solution. I would like advice on how we can help him more as personally I am not sure what really can be done other than comfort and support him.

I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD, an eating disorder, borderline personality disorder, insomnia, and previous substance abuse. I’ve been told I had ADHD and schizophrenia but neither were true. I’ve been in psychosis, I’ve had multiple suicide attempts, and the symptoms I display for each of my disorders continuously intermingle with each other that sometimes it feels like even my therapists don’t know what is causing my issues. It’s like they are afraid to put me on any medications, like every therapist I go to doesn’t know what to do with me. My trauma list is too long and the scale of my symptoms are too grand that it’s like everyone just wants to admit me for something  and hope for the best. These people are supposed to be specialists and they either are not capable or don’t want to deal with a comorbid patient. I am not an experiment and I am not a lost cause, I just need genuine fucking help so I can live a manageable life and no matter what I try I just can’t find any.",02Feb2020,1

It’s like my brain takes things I’m afraid of, or obsess over (my pets) and plants them in my peripheral vision. I see people running past, people sitting on furniture, people walking by, my animals walking past, all of which aren’t there. If I spend too much time looking into the shadows in low lighting weird transparent figures start to form that resemble ghosts. Last week I was trying to go to bed and my room was full of transparent ghosts.

These things used to happen to me maybe a couple times a week before, now they’re happening many times a day everyday. I can recall one incident from a year or two ago where I was sitting at the table facing the glass sliding doors. It was dark out so they basically turned to dim mirrors, and when I looked up I saw a giant misty figure hovering in the kitchen behind me. When I whipped around I saw it but only for a split second, and I was too scared to finish what I was eating.

105,"**Pre-submission apology**: Sorry for the super long backstory in the beginning.  I just wanted to show that the capacity for confidence and motivation are clearly within me somewhere.  I just can't find them at this time.  It was also therapeutic to vent for a while.

You can skip to the summary at the bottom if you just want to see the issues I'm dealing with.

&amp;nbsp;

Some backstory about myself, and where I **[32m]** believe my lack of motivation came from:

I've always been an introvert who preferred sitting in the corner of family gatherings, and most holidays I would only speak to 2-3 family members before grabbing a bit of food, and eventually trying to exit without being seen.

In 2018 I made the drastic decision to leave my part time job in the US to pursue teaching abroad.  I did almost all of the research myself (proving that the ability to help myself is in myself, just buried somewhere), registered for an intensive teaching course at my destination, saved up a comfortable amount of money, and took my first flight ever.  After about 2 weeks of living in my new country I started the teaching course.  It was 40+ hours a week for 4 weeks of classroom studies, self-reflective essays, exams, and 6 lessons that were to be taught by ourselves in front of 20-40 students.  As an introvert who barely even spoke to his own family, the thought of getting in front of a room of students for 50 minutes terrified me!

I was super eager to attend the course each day, even though it meant a lot of studying, and preparing our lessons.  When we got to our first practice lesson, I was extremely nervous.  Setting up all of my materials on the board/desk as the kids got into their seats, I was shaking...and if anyone had asked me a question I'm sure my voice would have cracked.  As soon as my examiner signaled from the back to begin, my nerves almost completely went away.  I'd never seen that confident side of myself before, and I'll take that feeling with my for the rest of my life.

At the end of the course, myself and my 10 classmates received our teaching certificates, and I actually had the 2nd highest overall scores.  The only one who scored higher was someone who already had half a decade of teaching experience.

Shortly after I got my certificate, my issues slowly began.  I started taking on individual students.  The lessons were acceptable, but I knew I needed to do more to help my students achieve their goals.  I would check Google, YouTube, ask for advice from other teachers...but I couldn't find anything that would help, and I gave up.  A few weeks later I would seek advice again, find nothing for me, and give up again.

Over the next year, I adapted my lessons in minor ways, not in the major ways I really wanted, but in general my lessons stayed the same.

During that time I slowly but surely lost my confidence.  With a lack of confidence, I stopped searching for new students because ""My lessons are not good enough right now"".  With a lack of new students, my income shrank.  With a shrinking income, my savings shrank.

And that brings me to today.  I've got about half a year of savings from the US remaining, but I need to get back my motivation and confidence before it's too late and I have to abandon my dream here.  I am legitimately happy with my new life here, and I would be devastated if I had to return to a part time job in the US.

&amp;nbsp;

**Quick summary of the issues I've got swirling around my head**:

1. **Lack of motivation**: Despite the fact that my savings are dwindling and I need to take on more students to increase my income, I don't take the time to properly scour the internet for ideas to expand my lessons

2. **Lack of self-confidence**: Stepping away from my career issues, my unhappiness has caused me to overeat and gain 5-10 lbs.  I know it's not much, but it's enough to make me self-conscious when I leave the house.  If I have to go to the store, I usually wait until it's dark out to avoid ""people looking at my overweight self"" - which is ridiculous.  I know people are just living their lives and they don't care.  But my brain keeps telling me they do.  Hell, I can't even muster the courage to *go walk* to improve my health because people will see me.

3. **Overly dependent on others**: For all intents and purposes, I am incapable of going to do most things by myself.  I can do necessary stuff, like going to the convenience store for food or supermarket for home supplies (assuming I am having a ""good confidence day"" - otherwise I just put it off 1, 2, 3+ days).  But going out to eat (I usually order delivery), shopping for clothes (I've needed a few new shirts for a while), walking around the park, etc. is impossible for me in my current mental state.

4. **Spend too much time on the internet/games**: This one has really wrecked my ability to focus on anything (including researching lesson ideas for more than 10 minutes without opening up Reddit or something else).  I've seen memes where someone will close Reddit, then mindlessly open Reddit again.  That's legitimately me sometimes, and I hate it.  I want to break away from the cycle of Reddit -&gt; YouTube -&gt; game 1 -&gt; game 2 -&gt; repeat

5. **Lack of self-control**: Some days I can eat an entire large pizza or a bunch of cookies/donuts/cake/etc.  Even on a good day when I limit myself to a normal-sized meal, if I get slightly hungry again later I will have the mentality of ""I should just get a big meal to fill myself up so I don't get hungry again later""

106,"Hi, I posted it on /askreddit, but maybe here its better. Ill copy my post.

TLDR: I see lights moving in specific patterns when looking at carpets for a prolonged period of time. Its beyond my control, anyone knows something about this?

So hi everyone. Title sounds a little confusing, Ill try to explain this to my best.
Since I was a little kid (5yo? Now Im 26) whenever I stare at a carpet for like 10 seconds without blinking, I begin to see these flashing lights moving from left to right, from up to down, following the direction of this carpet's texture. 
More or less, its like Im looking, from above in the night, at a highway were thousands of little shiny cars move super fast trough the carpet. Its like a lights' party! 
Yeah it sounds crazy, doesnt it? I always remember having these phenomenoms. I remember spending all my church sundays looking at these lights on the (hiper mega giant) carpet of the church. Well that was hypnotic! Like thousands of lights going around trough the carpet (but mind, not casually, always following certain angles).
When I talked to other kids about this, or my parents, or friends growing up, no one understands whats going on and looked at me like I was weird (which I am) or crazy (which I dont think I am).
I called these hallucinations, but actually I dont believe they are. I never hallucinated for anything else in life exept for carpets.
My only explanation its that my brain, somehow, recognize sunconsciously some pattern I dont understand or dont see, and automatically tries to connect those patterns? Like when you have those ""games"" where u have to connect dots in a certain order to.obtain that particoular image.

I am a student and am extremely busy. I'm always sooo tired and still have tons of homework when I get home.I would say there are aspects of school that I do like such as my favourite subjects but I feel like im losing enjoyment in that too. And my classmates barely help my situation. I've tried being very open with them but can't help but think that it looks like i'm looking for attention. I also cannot stand the culture surrounding mental illness in my class where it is trivialised and relentlessly joked about. There are people outright claiming they are mentally ill just for the ""lols"". I absolutely cannot stand them. I've tried my darnest to forgive them  and tell myself that they are just under educated about the topic but a lot of times I can't bring myself to do that. 

The worst of this however is that assholes and bullies(Usually the same people) get away with a lot of shit and are having thetime of their lives doing so while I know classmates who suffer at the hands of disfuncional families, overworking, stress and mental illness alike.(These people are sometimes the victims of the bullying). Its.just.so.unfair! I get that life is not fair sometimes but it's just been so long and I'm starting to lose all hope that things will get better.

School is also extremely fast paced, even more competetive and stressful. It's not just my school its the general school and parenting culture of my country.I'm cooped up in either a classroom or my room alsmost 24/7.

My home life isn't any better. I won't go into detail because this is getting long (you can ask if you are curious). but I don't trust any of them (Other that then dog) and feel incredibly tense and depressed around them.

* My dad probably had Munchausen's By Proxy or had a delusion about everyone else other than him was mentally ill. He would enforce SSRIs on me whenever I expressed a glimpse of emotion or did something slightly out of the norms. I've had suicidal thoughts since I was 5, and repeatedly tried to run away since I was 11.
* My abuse wasn't taken seriously because I was upper-class and my dad used to lie about I'm delusional. I expressed the want to be poor since I was 6-7, and often role-played as an orphan. I faked being poor in university for attention. I was de facto expelled in the first semester for harassing other people and sabotaging lectures.
* I have a undiagnosed developmental disability and faced discrimination in the school enviroments. Due to it, I've always had the ""if you get slapped to the right cheek, slap the left"" attitude. My violent behavior was mistaken as a symptom of my condition and I took advantage of it.
* I sometimes obsessively repeat things I say a lot because I'm terrified of not making myself clear.
* I often have intrusive thoughts of harassing homeless kids, or stealing their money to give it to kids who are able go to school. (Like the reverse of what Robin Hood did).
* I often am very uncomfortable around poor people to the point I fear going to neighborhoods that are more ""ghetto"".
* I see myself a misunderstood villain to the point it becomes unhealthy.
* I have attempted suicide for attention with no intentions to die. I attempted suicide a few months ago by intentionally creating a gas leak and going to bed and survived it and acted like nothing happened afterwards.",02Feb2020,1

I've got body image issues and also I've self harmed myself  and keep getting suicidal thoughts like I belong nowhere and stuff...I did talk about it to my to my friends but they were like its just negative thoughts and stuff..Every thing gets out of control..I dont even perform that well in school..Is this a mental disorder?

118,"after a long time of struggling with my mental health I've had it and I want my life back.

I'm tomorrow sending in a letter basically saying I don't want to recieve any money from the state anymore because of a few reasons  
1. I'm not allowed to apply for jobs  
2. They've basically made it so that I can't live in my current apartment much longer because they've found me another apartment but can't seem to understand the money I get maybe only covers rent and nothing else.  
3. I'll only have this income until the summer because you need to reapply and that process can take months and if I get it denied idk abt going into debt because I'm forced to live in an apartment I don't have money for and can't leave because the state is like we own u.

I get both my rent and my food paid for now because I live here bc i was about to be homeless before now that I'm about to be homeless again. but the apartment is for like teens that's why they don't want me to live here any longer and want me to start paying.

This year could either end with me being homeless and wondering where tf i put all my furniture and my cat. Or it could end with me having a job and supporting myself and never being afraid of being tossed from city to city and feeling like just a diagnosis on a paper.

Problem is that whenever I'm like ""I want to get a job I want to be my own person again"" I'm being spoken to (by professionals) as if I don't understand I'm mentally ill and I'm 5 years old or something.

I have a really dumb plan but i think about this every day and it's the only think I can do because I feel like a prisoner? but they say im allowed to leave whenever i want but where would i go

a long vent",02Feb2020,1

122,"So I'm 18. I've been struggling with severe anxiety and depression for years now and whenever I've tried to figure out the cause I always link it to my childhood with my mother. Some people say I was abused, some people say I'm just whining and it's nothing...i dont know what to think. I just know that as a kid i was scared, alone and I felt worthless. I realise what i went through was not the worst thing a child has been through. Far from it, many kids get severely abused by their parents on an extreme scale and it's horrible. What I went through I dont even know how to interpret it. I lived with my mother and stepdad, and when I was around 7 my mum was going through alot of stress...not sure why. But she isnt the most stable person. Theres alot my mother has done when I lived with her as a kid so I'll name a few things she did and I want to know peoples opinions on it. 

So my mother liked to punish anything I did...and I mean anything from little petty things kids do to things you should punish a kid for, by sending me to my room and forcing me to sit with my back straight up against the wall and sit there all day, for multiple days on end. I was allowed toilet breaks and dinner. That was it. Other than that, I sat there all morning, afternoon and evening like that. No talking, reading, listening to music, playing with toys. Literally nothing. I wasnt even allowed to lay down or the time would be extended. I wasn't allowed to sleep until my set bedtime in the evening either. This would happen very often and each individual punishment of this could sometimes last weeks of sitting there. I got into the habit of talking to myself due to being so bored, and I'd spend the whole time mentally beating myself up and thinking I was not a good enough son. That was at 7, I still converse with myself at the age of 18 if I feel alone because of this. Is this abuse? Or am I just being a wimp? 


On fridays I'd have to polish, Hoover and tidy my room. Bear in mind I'm ranging from age 7 to 11. After everything was done, if there was but one speck of dust or one crumb on the floor or surfaces or cabinets...she slap me, shout at me, call me useless and tell me to repeat the cleaning process until it was done...sometimes I'd be there for the whole of a friday evening, trial and error to make the room perfect...and as a result for not managing to completely clean it perfectly, I'd be sent to my room as the usual punishment of doing nothing. 

My mum would often slap me alot anywhere on the body, I feel like alot of parents do this though...but with my other itd be for any petty things that kids do. I sulk or pull a little face, I get walloped round the head several times. It just made me scared more than anything. 


Often my mother would believe I did things and try to punish when in actuality I hadn't done anything wrong and she would practically interrogate me to tell the ""truth"" which she believed...when the truth was I hadn't done anything wrong. She would hit me, call me mentally retarded and verbally assault me until I told the ""truth""... when in actuality I'm lying that I've done something just so I can stop the hurting. 


Theres is a whole lot of other stuff my mother did to me combined with all this but I dont want to make this too long. Its already far too long...if you've read all of this. Thank you. It means alot to talk about this and get things of my chest.",02Feb2020,1
123,"Have you ever been misdiagnosed and if so how did you deal with it especially if you knew it wasn't going to go away?

I was diagnosed with atypical autism at 13.  
Borderline personality disorder at 18.  
Bipolar disorder at 19.

I think my borderline diagnosis was just depression/early symptoms of bipolar disorder. I believed 100% I had it tho but when my bipolar fully blossomed and especially after I got on mood stabilizers I have almost no symptoms of that.  
I've also always thought my autism diagnosis is actually social anxiety because I don't think they're that similar and it doesn't make sense that I have no difficulties with people at all unless I don't know them and the make me sweaty and anxious. I also wasn't involved in the entire diagnosis process and I was suffering from undiagnosed depression at the time so I wouldn't call my behaviour strange. My journal often said ""anxiety disorder/unspecified anxiety disorder"" without it really being more than a line in my journal that wasn't looked into. I've multiple times asked to know what my autistic symptoms are but I've only ever gotten that autism is a wide spectrum and some people have bigger symptoms than others but it doesnt answer my question.

I did get my autism diagnosis revaluated when I was 16 but the psychiatrist twisted everything I said and eventually told me I'm not even shy because he has worked with shy people I'm just autistic. Alright.

Problem is that I find that I so often get talked down to or get told I don't understand that I'm sick or that I need help or they feel the need to remind me theyre life long when I talk of my plans for the future. I also get told over and over and over about the option to go to a therapist for autistic people and talk about autistic problems sometimes I do think about saying yes so I can go and be like nope can't relate and hope they'll realize i'm not even autistic.",02Feb2020,1

A little backstory:

Came to China 4 years ago, with a girl that's supposed to be a very good friend. We came together on the same flight and lived together for 2 years before she had to move to another part of the city for work. We talk multiple times a week to check in on each other and meet up once in awhile as we are both pretty busy.

The event:

As you guys know, there's a serious virus strain going around in China and the rest of the world. We had both talked about our options and decided to remain here, so as not to get on a flight with possible carriers of the virus and not to infect our families, seeing as the virus can incubate for up to 14 days. Past few days been calling her, she doesn't answer nor return the calls, only for her to pick up 3 days ago  and tell me she's on her way to the airport to get on a flight back to our home country. She didn't tell me anything about looking at tickets or preparing to go home. Didn't even have the decency to call me up and tell me she's leaving.

I've been crying for the past few days, because my feelings are really hurt and I expected better. Am I wrong to be upset about this? Are my feelings valid? How do I cope?",02Feb2020,1

So I'd just like a little bit of advice if that's possible, thanks in advance to anyone who replies.

A few incidents while I was younger caused me to have trust issues among other things ( Generalised anxiety disorder, Social Anxiety, PTSD, Clinical depression, low self esteem )

What impacted me the most trust wise was being cheated on in relationships. I tried to write off earlier cases of this as I was a teenager and young people do stupid things.

However in my first ""serious"" relationship I thought things would be different. We were together for 3 years, my ex enrolled at a college 2.5 years into our relationship (UK college so no moving away, just extra qualifications to get into University).

I eventually found out through one of her friends that she had cheated on me with multiple different men, almost immediately after enrolling. I quickly ended the relationship because infidelity is a deal breaker for me.

Since the split I have socially retreated inwards, I haven't dated, made any new friends, I don't work due to chronic illnesses so I see no one in a day.

Our split was almost 8 years ago and I feel like I have stagnated ever since. I distrust everyone with a major emphasis on women and I want to try and get back into the real world again.",02Feb2020,1
132,"'It is what it is.' I don't like this line. Not at all. I just don't like myself. I try to do something. I fail most of the times. Going back and forth with one thing is tiring.

But then I feel like a quitter. Which I still am because I can't do shit. 
I am not good at anything. Just leading an average, monotonous, boring day to day life. Even though I'm pursuing what I like, I'm feeling this way. Idk why I quit tbh. Or feel this way . I guess because this has become a habit. 
Neither can I talk properly. Nor I talk much. So yay good for me because then I feel lonely because I just can't figure out what to do. Should I share what I'm feeling to someone? But why should they deal with my shit. I mean it would eventually become stressful for anyone to go through someone else's shit.

I feel so on edge and on the verge of tears from the emotional turbulence, even though it’s not directed at me.

In case there are helpers on here - first responders especially - please know you can ask for help.  There are various resources available in Canada for first responders.  If I'm allowed to, I will link you to [a youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idINVnsuKe4) that lists various resources under the video available in your province or territory.  I made this music video in collaboration with local artists, first responders, family, and friends.  The video first starts by showing 3 different emergency responders (including dispatch), then the music changes and supporters come to help them get back to their feet.    


We first responders have a lot of difficulty asking for help.  We hide behind our roles so easily: if we are helping others then we must be ok.  Of course, that isn't always the case.  What we see and hear on a daily basis in our careers can be traumatic, on top of all of life's stressors.  So be kind to yourself.  We don't have to always be the person in control, the strong ones, the person who's ""put together"".  Sometimes, that could be a difficult task to ask for ourselves.

So, I’m not a worrier. At all. I’m usually free and easy, not a care in the world etc. 

But every now and again I worry about losing the ones I love. It’s not an accident worry, just a niggling little thing that drifts into my mind every so often during quiet moments. 

Now my fiancée and I don’t want kids. We like our holidays and stuff and want to spend our money on us. But sometimes my fiancée sometimes just asks out of curiosity if I really don’t want children. And while the aforementioned reasons are my primary reasons for not wanting kids I also worry that if I had them I’d love them so much that I would be scared of losing them. 

Plus I’m 30 and I’m one of those that doesn’t really know what I want to do in life so I go from job to job and I don’t want to be a disappointment to kids. That adds to the worry. 

I was trying to think when it started and as best I can remember I can trace it back to about 5 years ago. I still lived at home back then and suddenly my mum decided she was leaving my dad. They had grown apart, normal stuff, but it came out of the blue and blindsided me (and my dad being the pretty content, happy go lucky guy that he is, got blindsided by it too).

This coincided with me moving out which left my dad rattling around in a big house on his own. Since then I’ve felt a lot of responsibility for my dad. He’s a pretty independent guy and seems quite happy in his own company but I personally don’t want him to be alone all day every day. Anyway, that’s where the worry started, I think. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this, this just seems like a huge tangent. Haha anyway, TL:DR, I don’t want kids because of (amongst other more selfish reasons) my niggling fear of losing people I love combined with worrying I’m a disappointment",02Feb2020,1
140,"24F. Moving out of home caused me to become suicidal for the first time in my life. My mental (and physical) health was already in a bad place, but this pushed me over. I became actively suicidal for the first time (I fell out of love with life a long time ago.)

I’ve been in constant mental health treatment for 14 years. It hasn’t been that helpful, but I still pursued therapy and additional meds to try to adjust after this move. (I was already in therapy.)

My therapist about hospitalized me. The culmination of all these years in therapy was supposed to help me cope on my own, right? and I just suddenly put my foot down. I left her. I legitimately don’t know what will make me better, but I do know what will make me worse. Hospitalization **will make me worse**. Taking additional meds that make me sick **will make me worse** (part of the reason I don’t like life anymore is I live in constant pain and exhaustion from a health condition).

I honestly didn’t think my parents would take me back, but they did. I thought they’d say it was enabling me. They’re not to happy. *I’m not happy*...

But I felt *this* was at least a chance of saving my life... to go back to some physical environment that was comfortable (and had awesome therapy cats) and use it as a base to to keep figuring life out.

I know my therapist felt a legal obligation. I’m very glad she let me go, because I would have killed myself as soon as I got out. A health professional’s job is to “do no harm”, but it’s also to “relieve suffering”. I realized they couldn’t do that for me right now, and being on the edge of death, I needed that. So here I am.

141,"Hi everyone. I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this (pls let me know if it’s not), but all advice and suggestions are greatly appreciated. 

The situation: For the past few years, my mother and I have noticed my father become increasingly dictative, controlling, and stubborn. He believes that every opinion and belief he has is absolutely right and everyone else who disagrees is wrong and not normal. He doesn’t consider other people’s opinions as valid, and any resistance to his opinion leads to him getting very angry, upset, and  yelling. My mom and I essentially have to agree with everything he says and thinks. Additionally, he wants to control and monitor every aspect of our lives, claiming he wants to ensure we are on the ‘right track’. He pretty much tries to micromanage everything. I am fine with letting him know what I’m up to, but the issue is that he gets upset if I spend time with friends or even if I am doing school work (I heavily prioritize my academics and spend a lot of time on them). He wants me to spend a majority of my time with him or doing chores around the home. Finally, the other condition is that he talks for extremely long periods of time usually either repeating the same thing over and over again with different wording or by branching off and talking about previous experiences. It’s very common for us to have to sit and listen to him talk for 3-4 hours straight about things he believes we did wrong. 

So my question is, do you all believe this has something to do with his mental health, and if so what could the condition be. I’m fairly certain this has to be some kind of mental health condition since it’s been getting worse over the years. Also, what would be the best way to get help for my father? There is no way we would be able to take him to a doctor or psychologist regarding the issue since he would never believe that anything is wrong with him and he would get extremely angry at us. 

Sorry for the long post, but we are in desperate need for some advice. Any suggestion is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for your time!",02Feb2020,1

I have generally 3 mood states. They can swing between each other with or without reason.

My default is neutral. I'm apathetic about most things and things don't really bother me. I think this is my genuine personality. 

Next is a depressed mood. I'm way more pessimistic, skeptical, and cynical. I have almost no motivation and I'm just tired. I sleep more and feel guilty about it. I barely move or do anything. I get antisocial and I isolate myself. It usually devolves into suicidal thoughts and stays that way for a bit.

Lastly is really happy. It's almost the complete opposite of the depressive mood. I become trusting and motivated. I sleep less and try to stay up as late as possible (bc I dislike sleeping). I want to move and I get really social. I make more jokes and I try to talk with everyone. If no one is available, they're probably just busy. 

It's weird I can switch between those, and it's weird going from beyond sad to beyond happy in a few minutes, or vice versa. Neutral usually kicks in after I go to sleep, but my mood can swing to it too.",02Feb2020,1

I’ve tried just not disclosing it but that feels disingenuous, and counterproductive to put up walls like that.

149,"My mental health has never been in control. I've been diagnosed, for sure, with anxiety and depression. I've also scored extremely high for unspecified mood disorders. I came off of my meds last June, which almost cost me my relationship (I went completely manic and had a very bad meltdown). 

Fast forward to now, I'm pregnant, 33 weeks. Still in the same relationship. And I just feel incompatible with the world. Being around people is getting harder, and I feel like a giant burden to my SO, and even my unborn child. He recently opened up about his own demons and admitted he wanted to sleep with other people, and the results of that talk were damaging at the very least. 

I am seeking therapy and actively talking to my OB about a game plan, as I know postpartum is probably going to wreak havoc on my mental health. I just hate myself and I hate my personality and a lot of times I wish I could just start over. There's a lot of times where I don't even want to speak anymore. I feel like I take all of these steps to get better, but in my soul, nothing helps. I still feel very empty and very very sad.",02Feb2020,1

155,"TW: talk of self harm/suicide (I think I put this here)


Hey there all, so I have a councillor I go to, and i'm gonna meet this Wednesday and I haven't gone in bit, gonna be back for the first time in like 2 months, anyway, so I wanna tell her about how my mom doesn't sleep in my house and hasn't for like 2+ years, she lives with her bf. My mom is my guardian, and i'm still a minor, i'm 17 atm, anyway I feel it would constitute neglect, cause the whole parental supervision thing is kinda important, like she comes down a good bit, but still if something were to happen who'd be there to help. Anyway, atm I feel kinda calm, kinda like I've accepted it, but I've thought about mentioning it for months and I'd get super stressed and depressed about it, so i'm not sure how i'm gonna act when I finally do say it, cause I feel like this is gonna drastically affect my life, I feel like I kinda have to do it though cause my life isn't going anywhere atm. My family might start to hate me which'll be fun, tbh I amn't great brother, I tend to be super disconnected, and they even make jokes about how unemotional and uncaring I am/come of, but they don't really dislike me atm, but if I messed up my family there's already a good foundation for them to not like me

Also so like when I was younger 14/15 I used to cut myself, I don't anymore, although at times I kinda bite my fingers, like i'll bite down decently strong, and it'll leave a mark for a bit, but I don't break skin, although I don't know if that's self harmey, or not. I've never really been suicidal though, I think about it sometimes, but its never felt like something I'd do. Btw, although I've never felt extremely suicidal, when I was 14/15 went to a psych place a few times, and they told my mom I was depressed and self harming I think, like do you think its a good idea to leave a depressed self harming teen all on his lonesome, idk... I don't really know what's gonna happen, but I might do something bad. the thing is I feel kinda weirdly calm, and a lil bit sad too, like its drastically different to past me who was super anxious. Idk, tbh the thing that's been in my mind a lot that seems the most likely maybe would be impulsive sex, lol, the thing is I've been feeling a lot more sexual, and I seem to have a person who wouldn't mind, but I feel like I'd regret it, like i'm never actually dated anyone or had sex before, so if I did this I'd feel like it'd mess with me for it be my first, also btw, if you're conceded about std/sti stuff, I got some protection, lol. 

But anyway, that's what's been on my mind, I kinda mentioned it on r/offmychest, but this subreddit seems like it might be kinda better",02Feb2020,1
156,"Really long vent incoming but I actually have a question for people at the end

Recently I can’t stop thinking about how much time I’ve “wasted”. I’m in the UK btw and I started one year on a college/sixth form course not knowing what I was doing it for, I got too stressed out so changed it after about a year for  an art course thinking I’d like it more. I kinda didn’t and nearly quit it and swapped again for a health and social course as I think I’ve finally figured out what I actually want to do as a job (this course will get me onto a nursing degree). 

Basically I need to pass the course now up until around September as it will look better when I apply to change to the health and social course. The college is luckily being fairly helpful and helping me catch up and so far it’s going a bit better for me. The only problem is I can’t stop thinking about how I’ve wasted 2 years (the time it will now take to finish the health and social course when I start it) and all my friends will be going on the uni courses this year or next year while I’ll be like 20 when I start the nursing degree. 

Then I have to do 3 years of that too and I don’t even feel 100% about nursing as I’m always getting anxiety about if I’m making the right choice (almost irrational thoughts I think) and I just can’t shake this feeling that everything is kinda pointless to do and I’m not going anywhere in life but at the same time everything’s not worth it anyway. It’s weird and exhausting and I just feel really uncomfortable I guess all the time.

I’m also aware before anyone says, that in the long run 5 years of school courses is nothing to the rest of your life and also that the 2 years previously aren’t technically wasted as it took me a while to think about what courses I want to go on. Also because I’ve thought about it more I may end up liking my course and job(nursing is highly likely employable so I’d most likely get a job too) more than some of my friends who I don’t think know what they’re gonna do later with the course. 

Everything just feels empty sometimes and not worth it all together. Idk it’s really hard to explain. Another feeling I’ve had is like there’s something just “off” and you can’t place your finger on it. And it makes me really uncomfortable constantly. Also I know this seems like a strange way to relate this feeling to words but I remember when Michael from vsauce was talking about the uni bombers theory about how technology and the modern day life has come on So quickly that human evolution kinda can’t catch up and it causes some people to just not be able to cope with anything for seemingly no reason. That sounded mental when I wrote that down but seriously it’s kinda how I feel sometimes haha also I probably didn’t say that theory right I’m just remembering it off the top of my head.

There’s a lot of things that I’ve been thinking of doing differently this year. Go on holiday by myself(something that I have no clue about and stress over) also I didn’t find holidays relaxing  last time for no reason in particular so I don’t know what the problem was. I want to maybe take language classes too but I don’t know if I’ll be too stressed out with college to do that as well. I’ve never handled school well for some reason. I wasn’t even bullied or anything like that so I don’t know why I’m like that. All these thoughts really stress me out in themselves because i feel like I “have” to accomplish them even if I don’t like them because I know I’ll feel disappointed in myself if I don’t.

—End thoughts and question?—Anyway I’ve rambled my thoughts onto reddit probably for the first time😂 after this whole text I think I’ve actually had an interesting revelation going on. I wonder if this weird unexplained stress is actually anxiety or if it’s actually something like OCD over thoughts and things?? Idk if anyone will read this but if you do is this like me obsessing over and having intrusive thoughts idk if that’s what OCD is exactly so sorry if I’m offending anyone by thinking it is. 

I know my college said they could offer counselling if it would help me handle the class environment better so maybe if I did that I could ask their thoughts??",02Feb2020,1

But lately(last two weeks),i've felt broken more,like last year.I am really confused and tired.Cause i am back to square one.

I feel like i am slowly going crazy. I said that i feel healthy to my mom and she is happy. I don't want to upset parents anymore.

I was ill and had to stay at home,i felt so calm and comfortable completing assignments and studying without people bothering me. 
That's the reason why I don't want to go to school again,(because of communicating with people),even though i've socialized and belong to a group of friends. 

It's not for me.

I've been studying hard for 8 months and i can't give up now,i need to keep on doing it. And i know how much my parents work to afford my education, to help me pursue my dreams.How much they love me. But i just don't know what i can do to get rid of these worries.


 I am afraid to let them down,cause my feelings of anxiety and panic are taking over once more. I am afraid to lose control again.

That's the reason why i lost my sleep again.

yes, normal is subjective.

but then i find i don't click with many therapists since i'm not like a ""standard"" person.

for instance, lots of people my age are loud or dress in a given way. i don't. i'm not shy but then I just fade in. i don't lack confidence either, i just do my own thing. I also just dress in a hoodie, jeans, shoes/trainers/sneakers, and sometimes a cap. i don't do styles or fashions. so because i don't fit a standard in people's minds, i get told lots of shit.

it's actually pretty funny. it doesdn't offend me. it used to but not any more. 

i think it's because of the halo/horn effect. because i don't come across as ""typical"" then it clouds judgments. 

i guess the point here is 10% venting but 90% inspiration too. who cares if a person is ""normal"" or not? I think it's a common theme in self-esteem and mental issues, and provided a person's character doesn't hurt others, then be oneself.

it's funny, and in some ways sad, that people who go to a university for three/four years to study a degree, or even longer if they do a masters/PhD, to not understand how people function at a base level. for me, i just live to get to the same level as everybody else in life. some person with an undergrad or postgrad degree cannot prevent me.",02Feb2020,1

165,"Hello,

Don’t know if this is the correct forum to post this, but here I go.

Over the past 5 months my brother has been losing his mind. He is in his late 20’s. Symptoms / episodes are:

-He believes he has gone to other worlds where he has learned a lot and says we were there with him
-He believes our neighbors have hacked into his dog’s mind. He has a strong bond with the dog and believes they have hacked him through hacking the dog
-He freaks out if my parents let their dogs off the leash because they are breaking the rules and, by doing so, are hurting his spirituality
-He, at times, believes he and/or his dog are Jesus
-He had an episode where he screamed at my neighbors in the street because he believed they were trying to kill him and my dad (they are not - bewildered all of us)

His symptoms come in waves. They seem to heat up for a week and then he becomes normal again for 6 weeks. We don’t bring up his episodes to him when he is acting normal because we don’t want to agitate him / throw him back into that mindset. We brought him to a psychiatrist but don’t know how good she is at helping him. She diagnosed him with depression and gave him a low dose anti depressant. It helps out but he doesn’t seem to consistently take it. One other thing is that he doesn’t mention any of his episodes when he talks to the psychiatrist- he keeps it secret. The most he he has mentioned is his ‘third eye’. I think he might have  he schizophrenia but would like some advice from this forum. Let me know what are some good options in terms of getting him help / how I can better support him. In Southern California, in case any1 has recommendations.

170,"Hi there!

I'm in need for a bit of advice so I thought I'd tell my story here and perhaps some of y'all could help me out with a wise word or two.

As long as I remember I've always had a very active imagination. I can't say I've always suffered because of it because it gave me a very interesting childhood, but it also had its huge downsides. I used to have terrible insomnia out of sheer fear because I would see creatures and people in my bedroom or sense their presence. My parents never believed me, rational people as they are, and honestly now, many years later I can't say I believe me either even though I remember many of those moments clear as day.

I used to have a hard time in kindergarten and middleschool since I would constantly be either tired from the previous night or dreaming and not paying attention. My teachers suspected ADHD but in a small community like the one I'm from it's not really a thing to just go and get diagnosed. You keep it under and deal with it. 

Anyways, I'm past that period now, 18 and finishing my senior year in high school. I could say things have gotten better since I don't have much trouble with sleeping about 80% of the nights and I've kind of learned to force myself to focus. The remaining 20% is what I'm here for because sometimes it gets really bad. I'm gonna describe my most recent episode (?) and let y'all be the judges.

I'm renting a room with my roommate near school and that day I got there a night before her so I knew I would be alone all night. Everything was fine for a while: i lit some candles, turned off the big lights and on the christmas lights and settled down to enjoy a book. Then, I realized that I needed to use the bathroom and that's when everything went south. On my way back I passed the two empty showers and after catching a quick glimpse at one's half-open door I couldn't shake the feeling that someone was right behind that door looking at me. Of course, having lived with this kind of stuff for 18 years I knew that it was probably just a feeling and I tried to calm myself down but I couldn't stop constantly looking over my shoulder the whole way back. I got to my door and almost ran the last few meters until i had safely closed it behind me but even despite that I could feel the panic bubble up. What if someone's already in my room. I looked at my closet and my hands started to shake. I quickly opened the door but nothing was there besides a sweater I had left there last week. I then turned back and started going towards my bed, then gasped and tripped over a chair trying to turn around. For about a second I was certain that in the reflection of the window I saw a very skinny woman stand behind me. By the time I got to my bed I wasn't even thinking clearly anymore and my brain's only remaining function was the fight or flight mechanism.  I curled up by the wall in the corner of my bed just staring blankly in front of me trying to not look at any dark spaces (especially the window) that could trigger a new wave of panic. I couldn't even close my eyes because I was certain that the monent I do that there will be someone standing next to me staring at me without me being aware and I couldn't risk it. I know that's never happened but i moments like this I always excuse these thoughts with ""there's a first time for everything"". 

Anyways, I eventually calmed down and even managed to go to sleep but stuff like this keeps happening and I don't know how to control it. I know it doesn't sound too bad written out like this but during the moment itsef it feels like my life is on line and this is the moment I die. Even writing it now keeps triggering those tiny panic attacks (for example I'm terrified of closing my laptop right now because my brain is certain that it will reveal a terrifying face or smth behind it). 

Has anyone had a similar experience or could direct me to someone who has? Anything helps, even if you're just guessing!

Thank you and so sorry for the long post!

The place she sent me to was like a prison, suicidal and homicidal teens in the same unit, they took away things they said I could bring, strip-searched me upon arrival, and would strip-search everyone in the unit if there was a single marker missing. Allowed me one phone call to my parents only, and as soon as I started telling them about what was going one, someone came and took the phone away (listening from another phone?). Said I would have an hour of visiting time with my parents only, once a week, but I only got to see them for about 15 mins.

Someone said they wanted to know when a certain person would die, and the ""psychiatrist"" laughed and agreed.

Currently, I’m 14 years old. I’ve hated myself since 3rd grade. In 3rd grade, I was, to put it simply, fat. I used to look in the mirror and tell myself: “you’re fat and ugly. You’re fat and ugly. You should kill yourself.” every time I’d see knives I’d have the urge to take them and stab myself.

I’m self-aware enough to know none of this is true, and yet.... I’ve accepted it. I can still feel happy sometimes. I don’t feel sad. I don’t feel sad. I just don’t feel sad. But I know I’m not numb.... I know what being numb feels like, and this isn’t it.

There was a few events more recently in my life that sparked a lot of these feelings for me.

Last year, a kid (who shall remain unnamed) got nudes out of me. He had been begging for some since january, and on valentine’s day night, I gave into his requests. I *knew* I shouldn’t have, but I’m just as dumb a kid as him. I ended up telling some people I shouldn’t have, and he got involved with the police a bit (he was 14, I was 13). He was scared out of his mind. 

Afterwards, I pitied him. I pitied him so much that I became *infatuated* with him. For a little over 4 months, I was madly in love with him, with no real reason why other than pity. There was an on-and-off  of him sending me nudes and me sending some in return. I felt used each and every time, but I kept coming back to him because just getting a message from him made me happy. Then again, just getting a message from him *also* shocked my body full of anxiety. 

Then, in july, I met *them*. My first ever partner. Only four days after I met them, they and I started dating. I’d finally escaped those feelings I had for that one kid! I felt so fucking happy. But even so, when I was with them, I was almost constantly anxious that they’d leave me, or that they didn’t love me, or that they would cheat on me. Not because of anything they did, no. They were actually quite reassuring and always very sweet to me. 

Until late november. They broke up with me.... And it honestly crushed me. I felt so lost, hurt, and hopeless. I loved them from the bottom of my heart. For a month, I cried. For the next month, I didn’t have the will to cry. I just tried to be there and support them as a friend, as currently they’re going through such a tough time figuring out their gender. 

Very recently, any time someone asks how *I’m* doing, I just say “decent.” because honestly, I *have* been feeling decent. Much better than before. I still don’t like myself, though.

I still tell myself things. Things that I’ve come to accept without hesitation or tears.

No one loves me. Out of 7.7 billion people, not a single one cares. I’m pathetic, worthless. I’m too god damn pathetic to even hurt myself! I don’t deserve to feel pained, yet I don’t deserve real happiness, either. I don’t deserve these emotions anymore. I shouldn’t still be in love, if I even am anymore. But at the same time, I’m so selfish for trying to get over them. I’m selfish for trying to better myself. Can’t I see that so many other people have it worse, and that they deserve more attention and care than I do? My “problems” mean nothing in comparison. My “problems” mean nothing without even having to be compared!

Maybe.

Just fucking *maybe*.

I need to grow up.

178,"I'm diagnosed with a few mental disorders but my key problem is my depression. Since a few weeks I experience extreme mood changes every day! Most of the time I'm in a very good mood, I see almost everything in a positive way, I'm very creative, I'm laughing and talking very much and just enjoying life, although I have the feeling that my mind is exploding because I have so many thoughts and ideas. But at a moment's notice everything changes: I get depressed, I see everything in a negative way, I hate talking to other people and I'm tied to my bed because I feel so powerless. 
I'm very confused with those mood changes because I never had it before in such an extreme way. Are those mood changes just normal for the end of a depressive episode or does this sound like a bipolar disorder to you?",02Feb2020,1

I’m scared that everything’s just going to get worse and I really don’t want to go down that path. I’ve tried all I can to help myself, but it’s not working. So I think I need to tell my mom about it finally since that’s the only way a can think of getting help. I’ve looked up how to tell her about my mental state, and a lot of videos and websites have said that you should find a good time to do it. But there’s never a good time for me. My mom works late and when she gets home she usually stays in her room for the rest of the night(we don’t eat dinner together). Plus, my anxiety and worries make it 10x harder.",02Feb2020,1
181,"Hi. I'm worried about a friend who is talking about suicide a lot lately. She's 17 (18 in July) and has attempted suicide many times in the past (before we were close friends). Her closest attempt at 14 put her in hospital, where they weren't very supportive and basically told her that others have it way worse. She's been going through a lot lately and I've talked to her about getting help, but she says she doesn't want to until she's 18 as they'll tell her parents about it. Her parents are very unsupportive and emotionally abusive, and after her attempt at 14 her mum basically told her she should've tried harder.

It's been really bad lately. She told me that her suicide isn't a matter of if, but when, and she really needs emergency help. I was wondering whether she could be admitted into a hospital or something? I don't know how much she would like that idea, but maybe it would help. I'm a bit clueless about everything so if there are any better alternatives, please let me know. I just can't have her parents involved because they'll make everything so much worse for her.

So these are my questions:

* Can I (also 17) admit her into a hospital?
* Do her parents need to sign papers? Is there a way to avoid that?
* Could I or my parents or someone else over 18 sign the papers instead?
* Is there any way to get emergency help for suicide without getting parents involved?

Any help would be appreciated. I'm really scared for her.",02Feb2020,1

If being honest, today is one of those days that everything feels off?  I've got a good life ahead, almost done with school and about To start working full hours and moving to my own apartment and so on, but sometimes out of no where I get these thoughts of emptiness inside me, almost like everything is not going well and things will never be well. Im tired of trying to accomplish things and way too tired to even start, what ever it may even be. Im tired of being that dood who feels insecure all the time and is constantly feeling lonely and sad, sure I go out there and meet People and being social etc but everything still feels so damn insignificant. Thats all...

183,"For more context, I generally don't feel any form of pain when others are hurt or in distress, and I don't even feel guilt when I know I'm the one causing said distress, much less regret or remorse. I also feel nothing towards dead people, although I have cried over my pets when they die. I have a conscience and moral code for what is right and wrong partially thanks to what my parents, teachers, and others have told me I should do, but when I violate said moral code, I don't usually respond quite as strongly as how I believe other people might. 

I'm NOT seeking validation by asking this question, but I am curious as to whether or not empathy can exist without emotion given how much I hear that it requires a visceral response.

I have also been diagnosed with social anxiety and generalized anxiety by my psychotherapist, but I wasn't specifically told that any of my emotions towards other people outside of stress/anxiety/fear could factor into either of those issues.",02Feb2020,1
184,"I was doing this grounding exercise where eventually the exercise needed me to name one thing, just one thing, that I think is a good thing about myself. I almost went into a panic attack thinking about this. Right now I cannot name a single good thing about myself. I do not like the way I look, I have not exercised since 7 months. I have some work related obligations which are keeping me mentally occupied but since there are no real markers except the end of the year submission, I have been procrastinating all along and therefore hate myself for that too. My personal relationships are not going smooth either coz I am so consumed with worrying about work all the time. You get the sense: I am a hot mess and right now I feel so deep into it that I feel like there is nothing I can do to make it right. Nothing at all! I feel so alone because over the years my relationship with friends has also suffered. I am over sensitive and really something difficult to deal with for a long time. I almost feel bad for my partner for being stuck with me. 

I know these are not good thoughts or feelings but I am living with them. Moreover, when I try to analyze the situation in an objective manner it seems more and more true. I am clearly not well and it is such a problem for every one else around me to have to deal with my mood swings and sensitive behavior all the time.

185,"TW: suicidal thoughts/self harm

I am 18 years old and after nearly 5 years of depression and self harm, I am ready to get myself help. Most people in my life don’t know, especially my family. Honestly, I don’t want my parents knowing that I cut myself and constantly map out my own suicide in my head. I also can’t imagine sitting down and having a serious conversation with them about my mental state because they don’t understand mental health. My boyfriend is very supportive and he thinks I should get help as soon as possible. I told him I want to wait, but I’m really just terrified. The problem is, without my parents I can’t afford therapy on my own. I really just want a diagnosis and medication so I can go to college in the fall without my mental struggles. 

My main question is, who do I talk to for help? Do I set up an appointment with my pediatrician so they can refer me to a psychiatrist? Do I find a psychiatrist on my own? I really don’t know how to go about this.",02Feb2020,1

I can barely see the me of the future, I can hardly hear myself cry.

The tomorrow I thought would be nearer, in my head seems only a lie.


The further I reach for an answer, less is more and I'm starting to fray.

I thought the sun would be brighter and I thought this would all go away.


The clouds in my head are just darker, and the banks of my heart overflow.

You act like you get it, but quit it.  Because don't act like you actually know.


You can't stop a river that rages, so park your ass at the dam.

Maybe stop and listen a minute, instead of offering all the shit that you can.


I'm errording apart at the seams, the precipice creeps dangerously nearer, and nothing is ever the same.

I slide frighteningly close to the edges, and I fall because I've made my own cage.

A rainbow may shine in the darkess, but a dream is just a dream anyway.

188,"I'm doing everything right - lost 70lbs since attending the gym 3 days a week since the beginning of 2019, managed to start saving while paying down student loans, I try to be social when I can, etc. Still, no one has time for me. I've gone a full year without being asked to hang out, I'm always messaging people first and no one seems to have any interest in me. No matter how much money I have or what I accomplish at the gym, it doesn't make a difference. I used to think there was something wrong with me and that damaged my mental health to the point where I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt. So at this point in my life, it seems like I can only enjoy my life and be successful if I disengage and avoid people. Even worse with women, they all come off as dishonest and make me feel inferior so I dont even bother anymore. So at age 24 I have sort of just accepted things for what they are and have decided to focus on financial success and making gains at the gym over prioritising a social life and women. I'm a little optimistic I'll have those things one day but for now they are not my focus. Would you be able to live a life like mine?  

As a disclaimer, I should point out that my gym perseverance has helped with my mental health a lot and my perspective of things. I no longer feel inferior to anyone and don't let other peoples opinions of me that don't reflect the truth, don't reflect reality get to me. People can perceive me how they want but when I don't match up with their description they usually change their tune or face looking stupid I find.

190," hey, im 20yo and just wanted to write in hope i find a solution by myself or stop thinking about it. (sry for my bad english tho)

i usually struggle with social anxiety and burnouts, maybe depression but i never went to a doctor to get a real diagnosis . i dont hate myself but i see no value in me, i draw but recently my art became shitty and messy, i had multiple projects but ended up destroyed. i often have panic attacks before sleeping, cry and then fall asleep of tiredness.

Recently, i lost one of my sketchbook which is like a part of my soul, there were a lot of memories and dear drawings in it. Another of my sketchbooks is at my best and only friend's house but since i had problems with his ex, she teared it up when she found it in his room and my friend is scared to bring it back to me due to the trauma she caused (because of her, i dont trust girls anymore or even people that seem nice at first, i always feel like they'll drop their mask and destroy me like she did). So now i kinda feel really vulnerable 'cause i thought i can forget about her after 2 years trying to forget what she did to me and my friend and maybe forgive her 'cause its useless to keep anger inside me but no. Now im writing 'cause just found out that my friend is into cocaine, and i think its not only occasionally, he used to smoke a lot of weed and now he found out coke can make u feel awake and alive. Im really worried that he gets deep into it 'cause it's not only coke but he also takes ecstasy and speed in parties. I feel shitty 'cause i thought i was bringing him a bit of support and love but guess not (i'll try to talk about it next time i see him, it's not easy since he lives in another city and rarely respond to my messages 'cause he's often busy or with people)

These last two years i cut bonds with barely all the people i know except my best friend and family and i dont feel like making new friends will bring me something good. I thought about going to a therapist, I went to three different psychologists but everytime i give too much informations about myself, i just stop seeing them, i do the same thing with people, it's pretty annoying 'cause i feel like a bad person lol. I'm just really worried about my friend who finally has his own appartement, his job and dreams, I think he suffers from depression but he's the kind of person to forget about himself, he hates taking care of himself or seeing he needs something or that people are worried about him, he thinks he doesnt matter and thats a waste of time to worry about him.

Sometimes my serotonin gets so high I get the “electrical shock” sensations I’ve found high serotonin gives me. For example, Busbar causes this issue really bad. I also know it’s high serotonin because when I take my anti psychotic in the evening they go away. And only seem to come on the next evening, and get worse until I take my antipsychotic. Then it goes away.
Raising my dose of my anti psychotic ISNT an option. 
What are natural means of lowering serotonin?

It is to the point where I think i may lose all my friends and my boyfriend - my actions absolutely disgust me. My actions are, when drunk are becoming hateful and mean to almost anything, shutting down, and saying untrue things that come out of nowhere. On top of that, to be completely honest, I have a problem with alcohol as well. I have been using it to cope since a young age. I hide it pretty well but it's obvious in a social setting. I lose complete control and turn into this hateful and mean individual. The other 95% of the time, I have people magnetize towards me because I am a happy, genuine, and joy-filled individual. What makes me happiest in life is cheering up the whole world. Yet, drunk me is a completely different person. I have never had to come face-to-face with my problems because I was never in love. I have now met the love of my life, we are perfect together in absolutely every way. I could not ask for a better individual. He is so kind and patient that he never gets 'mad' about when I behave in this manner, but instead, he just says everything is fine. Everything is not fine to me. I am a 24 y/o who just moved back home after 4.5 years of University. When I first moved away for school, I was so excited to leave my home town,  I never planned on moving home. I then met the love of my life over the summer and everything changed for me. Summer was magical with him. When I went back for my final semester of school, I became incredibly confused because I missed him but also loved the city I was in. Now, I moved home and absolutely hate it. I am living with my parents, broke, and unhappy in every way. It seems like I am actively ruining the whole reason I came back. I am deeply in love with this man and he is sticking by me through this, yet I can't keep getting mad at him. I am going to open up to him about the trauma I did experience. I am tied to the hometown now because I also found a proper job and got re-hired at my summer serving gig which I will work at for the weekends to pay debt. I have all of these jobs lined up, yet, I feel like I no longer can live the reinvented life I had created for myself far away from my history and past transgressions and trauma.

Every morning I wake up and just look in the mirror, and tell my self I’m not a bad guy. I don’t know why, I say the most offensive crap, laugh at videos of people dying online. I lie to my parents and people for personal gain, and I have stopped caring for what people say or think about me. 

In elementary and middle school I was bullied a lot, and I would get called names, get slapped, and humiliated at school. When I got home everyday, I wouldnt tell my parents, all they would do is call the school and complain but, that never really fix anything, just make the bullying worse. Home life wasn’t great either, parents were arguing, it would just be a constant argument everyday, yelling, hitting, and I’d cry and tell my parents to stop but then they’d get mad at me. Over the years I thought of horrible things to do to these people, these bullies, my mom always taught me to never hit anyone, and tell the teachers. But you know what they say in school, snitches get stitches, so I kept my mouth shut.

I have ADHD, and back then it was severe, I would crazy and weird things, and people would laugh at me, medicine never worked, and even had teachers ask me out loud in class if I took my ‘focus medicine’ yet. So I would do outlandish things, just to get people to like me. But as I grew older I realized they were laughing at me, not with me. I feel like all this just built up a shell, it’s hard for me to feel anything, love, empathy, remorse. My friends will tell me sad things happening with them but I have to pretend to feel bad for them, cause otherwise I wouldn’t react in no way. 

I say horrible things and make fun of all groups of people, obviously in a joking way, but these, emotions, and the way I perceive stuff ruins relationships I have with people. I watch shock videos and I don’t feel bad for the people getting hurt or killed in them. I don’t feel anything, I actively search for these just for the ‘shock factor’ of the video.

It was really confusing to me at the beginning, and I didn't know why. Yet, I'm still confused, but I do not even care why, I'm just ok with it. I was always a very active person, jumping around, talkative, extroverted af, but maaan, fuck. I just lie in bed barely moving, I can stare at one point for half a hour a somehow stay entertained by it. Even if I am hungry or thirsty, I can't get up, like wtf why would I do that? I just can't do anything. Food tastes bad, I can't do homework, I'm not entertained by ANYTHING, not even gaming can solve it, but guess what, staring blankly is a fun town party.

I am still being humorous and trying to keep optimistic about it, but I can't escape that sad mood, I cannot, I'm aware of it, but I cannot solve it, It's generated from thin air or somethin.

My mood swings are like rollercoaster. Sad, Angry, Sad, Happy for 10 min, Angry... and again, again

I just want my mood to be ok again, what can I do ?

This weekend, I have done some philosophy stuff, just because phone was my only friend and there were some juicy ytb videos.

Guess what? Gold mine, I was enthusiastic, happy, just like before, but even more. It was a really great time, but fast forward 2 days... ""Imma kms mood again.""

I'm sorry if this post is somehow scattered around, but I just type what I think about and I am really sleepy and want to get it done quickly.

I want go visit some psycho..something person to tell me what could it be or some tips on how to deal with it.

I struggle with some more personal stuff too and I do not want to talk about it here, but it's nothing serious, it's just that I have no one to talk to, I feel left out, maybe that's the main reason ? I get way more happy when someone talks to me. I just miss someone who would care for me for the most part I guess, but I'm not sure, still.

Do you have some experience with people just being sad and able to do nothing ? Please help, I am afraid of it getting even worse and I do not want that.",02Feb2020,1
201,"Hello all, I'm a psychology undergraduate carrying out a study in need of participants. If you have some spare time I would appreciate if you could complete the survey below!

This is a study looking into the effect of sleep disturbances on mental health (inc. Suicide behaviours). Participants will be asked to answer a series of questionnaires. This should take no longer than 30 minutes. Further information regarding confidentiality and more can be found in the information sheet.

203,"So having moved yet again I find myself back on square one. It's refreshing yet annoying. What's annoying is, this time around I'm staying in touch with the people I left and haven't exactly tried to seek for people here. Also this seems to be a tough crowd and I seem to be more pedantic about my company. I have always made friends like good friendship either with work friends or flatmates. Flatmates are but shite tbh like wil almost ignore. And haven't found work yet sooo... Yeah. Also uni people seem kinda hesitant hanging out 1 to 1, apologies if this sounds likw not a problem, problem. It's just I can see this aspect affecting me and not in the most positive manner, we are social beings afterall.",02Feb2020,1

205,"I used to have a great friend. We would talk about any and everything. No limits. No boundaries. 


Until last September when we split up. And now I refuse to tell people about the tiniest of problems I have. I just try to lighten up conversations and I make self-depreciating jokes. 


I want to tell people about how I'm struggling to maintain good mental health, but I'd rather just lie. I'm tired of losing friends. I can't keep introducing myself to new people if they keep disappearing so fast.",02Feb2020,1
206,"I don’t want to go into too much detail but I’ve recently had my first session with a new counsellor. I was referred for talking therapy at the beginning of last year. I hadn’t received any documentation or had any correspondence from them until last week, despite repeatedly chasing them up. 

Prior to this appointment, I’d filled in two forms, to summarise how I’d been feeling for the last two weeks &amp; to determine if I had a good support network. First of all, she forcefully suggested I change the answers on the first form (about my feelings). I had considered all of my answers very carefully &amp; I was confident that it truly represented my feelings. She picked up on my answer to the last statement. “I feel like I would be better off dead or hurting myself in some way.” I had chosen “nearly every day.” I explained that I often struggle with suicidal thoughts (roughly every 2-3 days) &amp; I have considered how I would do so. She replied that, as I hadn’t made any plans to take my life &amp; there were preventative factors (such as me not wanting to leave family behind), I was not considered suicidal. 

She didn’t even glance at the second form. She handed me a third form entitled “How to keep myself safe if I’m feeling suicidal.” She could tell I was finding it difficult to fill in, but she just sat &amp; waited whilst I contemplated my answers. She didn’t offer any help, nor did she talk. There was complete silence, which was very uncomfortable. 

I didn’t want to disclose too much at the first appointment as it takes me a while to learn to trust anybody &amp; I wanted to try to summarise my mental health issues. Whilst I was enclosing some of the minor issues, she kept sighing (I imagine this was out of sympathy). I mentioned how my family can be rather toxic &amp; are very negative. I didn’t mention the verbal or physical abuse at home, or the constant worry I’m at risk. I would not feel comfortable talking about the more-in-depth struggles I face. I mentioned how I come from a broken family &amp; it was established that I have very low self-esteem. On multiple occasions, she told me I was “too sensitive,” &amp; “it’s all in (your) head.” 

At the end of the session, she demonstrated a couple of mindfulness techniques (such as slow breathing through the nose &amp; stretches I could try). She gave me another form to fill in, which asked me to “rate” my session. These questions were included:

“Have you been informed of the different talking therapies we offer?” 
“Have you been offered the talking therapy you feel is best for yourself?” 

At no point did she explain what options I had, nor did she make any suggestions as to a potential diagnosis, or even inform me of the next stage. All she said was “I’ll see you in two weeks.” 

I don’t have any friends to talk to about any of this, but my boyfriend &amp; colleagues are horrified. They say I need to log an official complaint before others have the same experience as me. 

I came out, in floods of tears, feeling suicidal. I can’t stop thinking about what she said. I’m constantly asking myself (&amp; my boyfriend) “am I too sensitive?” &amp; quoting that “it’s all in my head.” I can’t forget what she said. I am not a violent person, nor would I feel able to inflict any serious injuries on myself. I am really squeamish &amp; hate the sight (or thought) of blood. I wanted to smash my face in with a brick. I wanted to inflict enough damage for myself to die instantly. It took my boyfriend hours to console me. 

I’m absolutely devastated that I waited nearly 12 months for this session, to feel worse than I did (which I didn’t even think was possible) &amp; want to give up on trying to recover. What would you do if this happened to you?",02Feb2020,1
207,"I have always had hope that one day I’ll get better and even when I’ve had no strength left, I’ve always managed to tell myself that one day it won’t be this bad but a couple of weeks ago, something in me snapped and I have literally no hope left. I am exhausted and fed up of bouncing between the GP, the hospital, different medications and different therapies. I used to think it would take as long as it did but now I cannot even imagine staying another week if it means feeling like this. 

I’m so desperate. 

Please tell me some things that gave you hope when you physically had none. I need one thing to hold onto that I’m not able to then convince myself that I don’t deserve or it’s not meant. 

Please.",02Feb2020,1
