0,"Me (16M)  English isn't my first language, sorry.

My mood changes multiple times a day from super happy to sad and it's caused by the tiniest reasons.

Example: A girl I'm talking to responds with something that makes me super excited and I start to imagine how things could turn out and it makes me super happy (too high expectations)

Then she responds with something dull and doesn't answer for a few hours and I get super sad immediately and think to myself how I could be so dumb and have so high expectations.

I feel like I shouldn't care so much about those tiny details but even though I don't want to care, I do.

I wish I stopped having those high expectations and became so happy when I get a nice response and that I become so sad when I get a bad one.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this is because I'm a teenager or if somethings wrong with me but I need help because this is destroying my relations to both myself and everyone around me.",29Oct2020,1

3,"The walls I built around myself are high and undoubtedly impossible to pass. But somehow he found a way. He’s awoken that sweet feeling of getting hurt by a friend, who doesn’t have the intention to do so. 

He managed to hurt me yesterday, just by calling me mean all day, again and again. I literally wanted to cry. And today I told him about it, he didn’t get that I was serious about it though, so he said even worse things. He jokingly said things that really got to me, to the point I almost started crying. 

He noticed something was wrong, and when I told him about it he was genuinely sorry, telling me that everything he said wasn’t true and that he often doesn’t see when he’s taking it too far. 

I can’t believe my walls withstand so many emotions, but when he makes jokes he manages to get right into the core of the kingdom I built around myself to protect me from such. 

Ever since I’m single I crushed on so many boys, but he’s the first where I care about what he says. I really want to spend time with him all day. That’s all I wish for right now. 

Morality tells me it’s wrong though. Because first off I’ll only mess this up and waste his time, and secondly he’s the friend of my ex and I heard you can’t do stuff like that. Which sucks, because I really seem to get attached to him.",29Oct2020,1
4,"I suffer from body dysmorphia, bulimia, depression, and anxiety. I've been with my boyfriend for 2 years now and he knows all about my struggles over the past 10-15 years. I've been doing well recently; got off my meds, slowed down my bulimia, saw some friends. But obviously I still have bad days. I had one today and I went to bed in tears. I could feel the bed shaking from my sobbing. My boyfriend laid there in silence, and when I asked why he said he was frustrated. I asked why again and he said he was fed up of my crying today. He's said stuff like this before - told me he can't handle me, can't understand me, saw me not as the person he fell in love with 2 years ago. It's all becoming too much to bare.

5,"I (17m) can never complete an assignment on time ! At first I thought it was procrastination but even when I organize my time well and start much in advance, I overthink and get nothing done. And then I feel guilty due to my lack of progress and take it out on my family. I’m always stressed and I hate this. 

For example, when I get an essay, I will literally try to come up with the most complex idea ever, Something the teacher will frame above their bed. I know this sounds ridiculous, but I can’t help it. I get nothing done now. I had to stop working tonight because it’s getting late and I’m going to wake up early and work on it, can anyone give me some advice as to ways I can just get it done rather than spend 3 hours on it and make no progress?

6,"It was a weird experience, i share a bed with my sister and one night i was very anxious as i read about bipolar disorder and was super terrified i had it because i cried and then ate chocolate, which made me happy and energetic... i know better now.

So i remember thinking my anxious thoughts out loud in my head at about 9.30pm (bedtime) to rationalise and calm myself down.

I cant remember the exact words but i thought aloud in my head for example ""everything is fine"" and the word fine sounded like a womans voice simulatneously the word ""fine"" and i was like oh my god im schizophrenic but told myself that i was dramatic and fell asleep.

The same week, as bipolar was a new obsession, i was exhausted everytime i had an anxiety attack after having any emotion at all. I was in class and thinking about how my life is over and this time i was so exhausted that i was just staring at the wall, in almost a dissociative state. All the laughing and talking of my classmates became muffled.

Then again when i was repeating a thought aloud in my head to chill out, the same thing as the previous experience happened except it was a mans voice which like woke me up. It didnt feel like it was someone talking, like a loud sound around my head. It wasnt like i looked around to see who said it cause i knew no one did, it sounded like a ghost in the horror movies instead of an actual person in the room...

The thing is i caught myself doing this on a seperate day, it was just my brother clearing his throat (i was also anxious at this time) and in my head was a word like tangerine. As i said this word in my head and he simulatneously cleared his throat, it sounded like i heared someone say tangerine when infact it was the two things occuring at the same time and crippling anxiety.

So the first experience could have been my sister clearing her throat. As i realised that the word wasnt so defined, it was a one syllable word that could sound like another sound. But i have no way of knowing for sure. But the one in class was confusing as that sound specifically woke me up. Which makes sense of why it sounded like very ghostlike and light and not perfectly audible because it was actually just a sound not a word.

These sounds sounded like a mix of right next to my ears and inside my head, like being woken up from a daydream in movies. And it mainly occurs when im shifting from a state of anxiety into nothingness. 

Have you had this experience? What do you think? Could it be schizophrenia?

Ps: Im 15 years old and this both happened in febuary of this year. Also sorry that its so long, thank you for reading and i hope you respond!",29Oct2020,1
7,"Hello, I’ve been having issues accepting my appearance as of lately. I was on a couple of u/ threads that rate people’s appearances. I wasn’t too happy with people criticizing my appearance and I had a mental breakdown. It seemed upsetting and annoying to others, but other people understood. The people who didn’t like my post seemed to criticize me more harshly versus people who wanted to be nice. I had a hard time just believing compliments and heavily focused on the bad comments. 

I’ve have issues with my appearance for awhile. Being told I’m ugly, average looking, masculine looking, fat. I’ve improved my appearance by a lot, but I still have emotional scars. I’m pretty sure there’s something wrong with me where I can’t believe people telling me I’m attractive, and other times I do have an inflated sense of self. 

In reference, I am (21F), I’m in a six month relationship with my boyfriend. I’ve addressed this situation to him and he thinks it’s ridiculous I’m this upset over redditors commenting on my appearance (which it’s reasonable, I’ve been crying for awhile). He’s sweet but sometimes I feel like he’s just being nice so I don’t get upset. Please ask anything or suggest anything, I feel like this is bothering me more than it should.

11,"Possible Trigger warnings, mentions of not eating and thoughts of forced vomiting.

For context I’m underage (16F)and I’ve been struggling immensely lately with my mental health as a general and I have been since I was about 13 or 14 years old.

However for about a year I’ve been having major issues with my body image which started when I had an argument with my dad which ended with him saying I’m fat and that “no one will ever love you” due to my weight, I never received an apology which does hurt I’ll admit. But all this caused me to eventually begin skipping lunch which then led to me skipping more meals and obsessively exercising and now just eating a couple bites of breakfast and lunch makes me feel highly nauseous, coupled with thoughts of making myself throw up when I’m too exhausted to exercise just has made me feel awful.

Recently I developed the courage to tell my mum about my body image and relationship with food and her reaction was unexpected. She began to take me on very long walks together, gave me tiny meals which honestly feels like it’s feeding straight into my eating habits.

So I was wondering considering I’m underage and I’m living in the UK, how can I get support from someone? I’d rather not go through the process of telling a parent again but I’m just so desperate for help now, so how do I get help?",29Oct2020,1
12,"I'm a 31-year-old mother to a beautiful 7-year-old girl and my partner her father and I are together he is 39 years old. He is a great father and loving partner the sort of guy that never really gets angry and is always happy and has bucket loads of attention and patience for our daughter and she loves him and is a total daddies girl so this is why I don't understand why I've gone back to the past to dig things up and why I'm willing to break up what was our perfect family over something I think could be happening due to my partner's reaction to a school note that was brought home. 

You see last week was a huge week for me I started working after 7 years of being a stay at home mum and my anxiety was through as I struggle with insane social anxiety and on top of that I had a UTI and I had hardly had any sleep. So when my daughter came in to say goodnight to me with a school note that she had forgotten to show me earlier this is is where my nightmare began. So the school note explained that school was teaching the children about how to keep safe and that's not appropriate for anyone to touch them etc. This topic is something I've always spoken to my daughter about  because I was sexually abused as a child and I wish I had known that it wasn't ok and maybe if someone would have said something to me I might of spoken up and said something about what was happening back then. 

Anyways back to the school note so she handed me the school note I read it and commented to her  about how at school they were teaching her about keeping safe and that her private area is hers only and no one is ever allowed to touch them right and she agreed and said yes that's right no one is ever allowed to touch me so after this conversation I walk her back to her bedroom where my partner is standing and getting ready to do the night routine with her which is a book that we usually both do together and found I him acting nervous going through his phone he looked shaky and I was confused as to what was going on I actually thought I'd maybe walked in on him doing something on his phone that he shouldn't have been doing but kind of blew it off but it wasn't until he started reading out loud and he kept making mistakes and he looked super nervous that It dawned on me that maybe he had overheard what I had said and it had made him nervous. 

So this where the worst anxiety comes in that I have never experienced before I mean I had to be taken to the hospital because I was so bad out of my mind and shaking and cold. I'm booked to see a Psychiatrist next week but until then I dont know to do. 

You see that night my partner acted weird nervous. I started to remember what he done 11 years ago and it's something I've tried to forget as he told me it was an accident and I really loved him still do but if it happened now I would never EVER forgive him!!!!!!

I can't believe I'm actually writing this but my sister was 14 at the time and he may now-partner was 28 years old at the time and he, my now-partner was our neighbour at the time. It's kind of complicated but I had been secretly seeing my now partner back then as I had just broken up with my teenage first love. My sister had laughed one day at the fact that he, my now-partner had gotten drunk and stoned and touched her not knowing how wrong it was at the time as she was only 14 and she said it was consensual and it only last a few seconds but I was completely shocked and in disbelief. I mean I lost the plot I smashed his door down and punched and kicked him in a rage and he denied it at first but  then eventually after me threatening to go to the police he admitted it and I didn't speak to him for  about 6 months and I hated him wish him dead and even told him he better sleep with one eye open because I would kill him while he slept my rage was unbelievable I went down hill fast I stared partying hard and sleeping around but eventually, the rage left and I missed him and I loved him and I decided to eventually forgive him and to be honest once I chose to forgive him nearly 10 years ago I've really tried hard to forget about it but sometimes it pops in my head mainly when my partner and sister are around each other, they get along fine she calls him and invites him to dinner with her &amp; partner when I'm away. I'm not sure if she's ever thinking about what happened between them years ago. 

But I've become obsessed with the fact I forgave him now all these years later and I think it's due to the fact he acted weird about that letter and I've become Suspicious that he could be abusing our daughter even though she doesn't show any signs of abuse. When I brought it up with him about the fact he acted nervous he said was acting weird because he thought the note had said she going to be taught about sex at school and he thinks she to young to learn about that I told him that's not what the note said at all, and for him to read it again. 

I'm hoping the Psychiatrist can help me get through this but I mean I can't even look at him and I don't want to live with him anymore.

16,"and I still can’t stop doing it, because I feel like it was an order. 

My mom called the other day and asked if I got any new music for her to listen, and I was like “Nah mom, I’m feeling a bit empty lately, didn’t really do much.” and she went “Oh, is it the artist who needs to feel something to create, or are you just out of ideas?” 
I told her that I didn’t want to force myself to feel sad so I can make music, because I didn’t have the energy to do so. 
That’s when it occurred to me. 

It’s been two years since the breakup of a 5-year relationship when I was 21, and I was just getting treatment around that time -even though I had symptoms of mental illnesses way before that. What I told by my ex was to channel my pain and sadness of the breakup into my art. 

I occasionally make music on my PC, when I find the energy to do so. I write both in English and my native language. I just started photo/videography. 
And I can’t stop it. 
I constantly lean into dark and emotional melodies and genres, I feel like I’m entitled to tell this pain that I can’t escape, I choose scenes that yearn for love and I... I just need the pain. 

As much as I know that how stupid it sounds, I still can’t stop myself from doing it. The annoying part is that if I struggle to create the art that I envisioned, the first number I call is always the pain. Which leads me into making myself suffer to create art, which is supposed to bring me joy. 
What happens if I fail to suffer on command, you ask? 
Nothing. I fall into an abyss, isolate myself from everything, thus failing to chase my dreams of art, because what is art without pain?
Do I really enjoy making art, or do I use it as an excuse to emotionally hurt myself? 
No, I really love art to the bits, I’d even love to earn my living just doing art.
I just don’t know how can I stop myself from pushing my mind into the barbed wires, just to feel something so I can write another verse, shoot a dozen frames and play a few more melodies. 

I don’t even know if I want to get rid of the pain because I’m afraid of losing art too. 

I’m sure there’s things that I miss because I can’t get this tangle to be solved. I just needed to get this off of me, sorry if I’m in the wrong place.",29Oct2020,1

And I just had my parents for the first time tell me that I’m an idiot and full of disappointment. Never had to deal with any of these issues and I guess I just feel kind of lost. I thought to try taking healthier measures for my life, like fixing my sleep schedule, exercise, generally productive things to improve my health. But nothing has helped. I kind of just get up in the morning, make coffee, and read fanfictions on my phone in bed or on a chair in the sun outside until I get hungry or go back to sleep.

21,"I've posted about how I feel like my mental health is deteriorating and how I feel like I'm headed towards a breakdown and this is all still relevant.

I literally have been feeling worse and worse and today might just be the breaking point. I can't handle anything anymore. I'm taking 6 college courses as well as working 2 part time jobs that I very much dislike. I have an eating disorder at this point is just out of control, I'm drinking way too much idk the last time I woke up not hungover, I feel incredibly depressed and mentally unstable. I also keep having panic attacks especially while driving which is so fucking scary. I feel like I'm starting to detach from reality and questioning if things that are happening if they're real or not. I feel like life isn't real and like I died already and this is either Hell or I'm just watching the flashbacks.

Time goes by so quickly it seems impossible. I don't understand how 4 hours will go by and I can't even recall what I was really even doing and can't figure out how 4 hours went by. (No, I'm not blacking it out, like I know I was doing hw or whatever but I can't understand how it's possible for time to go as quickly as it did.) The days fly by and before I know it I have to get back into bed because I have work at 630 AM the next morning. I'm not understanding where the time is going.

I just want to cry and cry, I literally have no one in my life to talk to. I lost my health insurance when I quit my full time job, I just got a $630 bill from the last therapist I was seeing because she apparently wasn't in my network, and I have no idea how I'll pay that, making matters worse she is close friends with 2 of my close friends. 

I got denied for my state insurance because of an error I made and am not eligible to reapply for health insurance until the marketplace opens at least that happens in November. So I have no insurance to even talk to someone right now.

Before this last therapist I worked with a team, a dietitian, a psychologist and a psych. I basically ditched all of them, but sometimes my dietitian reaches out to me, but she is $90/half hour which I literally don't have anymore. She was the one person who really helped me with my eating disorder but I can't afford her.

I literally don't know what to do. I'm so stressed out about money, about life, about everything. I can't talk to any of my friends about any of this, and the one person I could kinda lean on has her own shit going on so I can't talk to her either. I don't know what to do. I don't trust myself, I've also started self harming again. I'm just at a loss. I don't want to go to bed because then I'll have to wake up and go to work and then come home and do homework and go to my other job and I'm just trying to put it all off.

This post is a mess, and I'm sorry, but thanks if anyone read it. I just feel like my brain is broken and I don't know how to proceed. I'm worried for myself I don't know if I'm going to make it much longer honestly. I can't handle this anymore.",29Oct2020,1
22,"I am in my early 20’s and a Junior in college. I feel like I just have so much and I need to let it out. I do not know how I am supposed to organize all of this. 

I suffered bullying from Kinder all the way to Senior year of high school. For most of my time in school, I had two friends (the only two people that didn’t treat me like garbage at the time). Others (people in my class and even students many years older than me) would treat me like a waste of space. 

I am paranoid and get the feeling that those around me are either making fun of me or trying to harm me in some way. It has even gotten to the point of me grabbing an object to use as a weapon in order to defend myself if they try to kill me. 

I have issues talking to other people. I am able to engage in conversation, but struggle to grow relationships. The only person that I have been able to grow closer to in recent years is my girlfriend. 

I sometimes hear my name being called and it causes anxiety. 

When I was entering my teen years, I started to get aroused by the idea of cannibalism. The idea of trapping a woman, taunting her, cooking her, and eating her without her being able to do anything about it makes me excited. Even so, I would never act upon this fantasy. I am able to feel empathy which causes me to feel disgusted at the idea of acting on such a thing. 

I spend most of the day lost in my thoughts. This is not a good thing since it distracts me from what I may be doing. Sometimes people have tried to say hi to me in public but I overlook them because I’m having random thoughts. 

I deal with both narcissism and low self-esteem. Sometimes I’ll look at those around me and feel inferior, like I don’t matter. Sometimes I will see others as being below me and garbage. I tend to compare myself to others constantly.

26,"I've suffered with depression and anxiety for 8 years to the best of my knowledge. What kickstarted my problems was my parents divorcing, then having to move to a new town and losing my home and all of my childhood friends. I was raised by narcissistic parents, verbally abused, and lived in a hostile, unloving environment. **I want help, but I'm at a complete loss on how to start and find it.**

I'm 22 now and as a result of how I was raised, I'm struggling with everything including basic adult responsibilities. I can't drive and don't have a car. I don't work and have never had a real job outside of short summer jobs. I completed half of my credits towards my Bachelor's but withdrew in early 2019 due to overwhelming pressure from my mental health issues. I am slightly perfectionist and hard on myself with grades, so the increased difficulty of my classes scared me too. I was also uncertain of my major and future career path.

I graduated high school and did well, but I had a lonely high school experience. No extra curriculars and never went to parties, sports games or anything. I had some good friends in school but we never hung out, just played games online. After I graduated, everybody I knew went their own way and I lost touch with everybody including the ones who were my closest friends. This was partly my own fault, my anxiety and fear of judgment made me too scared to talk to them. Now it's been years and I am completely alone.

4 years have gone by since I graduated high school, and I have failed to accomplish everything my parents/other family expected me to do. I don't work and I'm as far from self-sufficient and being able to move out as can be. Recently my home life has grown intensely toxic and difficult. I live with my mother and brother, but my mother has been planning to move into a smaller apartment and kick me out. She is currently threatening that she will move and ruin my life. Without her support in this vulnerable time in my life, I can't make it. I won't survive. I'm not ready to be an adult on my own. She has left me to fend for myself. She does not understand mental health issues.

I have no friends or anybody to confide in. I don't talk to my mother or siblings about my mental health. I'm alone. I only talk to my mother's side of the family but I believe they are growing frustrated, tired and don't want me around. I believe that everyone is looking at me and wondering, ""What is he doing? Why isn't he done with college? Why isn't he working?"" and it's wearing on me. **They don't understand the mental turmoil I'm going through.**

There are so many factors that have contributed to my situation. Childhood abuse. Lack of emotional support. Conditional love from parents. Narcissistic parents. Lack of proper education about how to be independent and make it on my own. **I am completely lost and afraid.**

**TLDR:** **I want help but urgently need help finding it, and forming a plan.** I want to take the first step. I haven't gone to therapy since I was a teenager and that was only a few sessions. I live in the US and have insurance that covers almost any medical need including this. I don't know where to begin. Do I look for a psychiatrist? Therapist? What is the process like to choose one?

Thank you. Anything that you share, I will read it. I want to start on the path to healing. I think I need to start with a therapist and psychiatrist for anxiety and depression that have been holding me back. Is that all I can do?",29Oct2020,1
27,"Why is it so difficult to find actual good help?
My new doctor is one of those people who says she understands depression because she majored in it and has read all about it... but hasn’t actually lived with it.. so I don’t really feel comfortable asking her for help because she also tried to convince me to immediately get on antidepressants, which I don’t want to try right now because of a negative response I had with them years ago. 
(I also don’t feel comfortable talking to her about this intense, wild pain i’ve had in my chest/stomach for about 1-2 years because the last time I visited her (last month) she sort of downplayed it, and didn’t really pay attention to what else I was saying.)
So that’s adding a lot of stress to what’s already there. I’ve also tried betterhelp, but it’s odd. They say you can connect with someone whenever for instant communication, but the counselors take days to respond (which isn’t what I started using it for). I met with a great counselor once a few years ago but when I emailed her later on, I got nothing. I’m getting more and more desperate. If anyone here has similar issues please share some tips..",29Oct2020,1
28,"I'm a 15 year old male, and have always been weird and awkward. Not just the normal weird and awkward, I was always bouncing around like crazy, acting dumb and cringy without thinking, and basically making myself a big target for bullying and being left out. My mom told me I have aspbergers (I was never diagnosed despite seeing pediatricians and psychiatrists), but I really don't fit many of the common symptoms of it. 

My other issues that affect me quite often is being easily irritated, even if it is small things like an itch or someone upstairs blowing their nose. When I get irritated, I can go out of control and I go in a rage that can last minutes of me hitting myself, biting myself, having violent thoughts and actions, and yelling. Some of these outbursts have caused many broken items, holes in walls, a broken hand, and things I regret saying. This has also caused me to avoid many activities such as video games and drawing/coloring in fear I might have one of these outbursts, and although I'm not depressed, being angry alot decreases my happiness. I have tried breathing techniques and other ways of calming myself, but these seem to annoy me even more since they don't work. 

Over my teen years I've been improving my social behavior, and some people find my energetic personality charming, but I still have some issues, and I dont like how all my life my primary focus was to improve myself in ways that would make others like and accept me. Sometimes I wish I could've ignored how people thought of me and just did what makes me happy instead of being controlled by how people thought of me.

 Another thing I experience is lack of attention and boredom often. This happens mainly in school, but I show alot of ADHD-like symptoms, such as hyperactivity and low attention span, although I do not believe I have ADHD. 

So, I have always tried to find some kind of answer for why I am the way I am, but I can't decide whether I have a mood disorder, or maybe I just naturally have a very high amount of hormones that cause my irritability and hyperactivity, as well as improper social behavior. If there is anything that could be a possible disorder that could be taken to therapy, or something that would at least decrease the instances of these symptoms, I would appreciate it.",29Oct2020,1

Im a sophomore in high school (15 M) and I’ve recently been really wound up and I really can’t take it anymore. I have no idea how to let out emotion, I haven’t cried since way before my great grandfather who served in WWII died maybe half a year ago. Plus, i met someone I liked and we have a good relationship which I won’t go too far into here but I’m overwhelmed with emotion and have no idea how to handle it. I’ve been really wound up and almost angry recently, I always have anxiety so me being super anxious isn’t weird, and I just want to cry. Sometimes I feel like absolute shit and I really feel the want to and I try to but I just can’t, my body and mind just shove it all down inside and there’s absolutely nothing I can do about it. I’ve been talking with several people and they all say I should get help and get therapy and see someone but my fear of judgement from even asking my mother or father to get me therapy stops me in my tracks, honestly my fear of judgement stops me from doing a lot of things and telling my mother and father what I truly think about them. Long story short they’re divorced, my mother manipulates me, my father does too they both do a ton of weird shit, my father was never around when I was little and my mother hasn’t ever taught me anything to the point that I’ve had to watch porn and I didn’t know what deodorant was a few days ago, and I don’t even admit to friends (even ones who watch porn and are open about it) that I do because of fear of judgement and how I was raised and I just can’t talk about emotion or anything with anyone and never have. I’ve spent the last while looking up how to cry because I really can’t take it anymore and I’ve been trying but it’s like banging my head on a brick wall. I’ve wanted to kill myself in the past and kinda have lately but am nowhere near that, idk To be honest lately I’ve been a mental train wreck, feel bad about a lot of things, and I don’t know I’m not getting therapy just yet for a number of reasons but I don’t know if there’s someone out there who knows what I should do differently or Idk Im probably being a dumbass and acting like a child and not getting help because I’m a pos and an idiot, even though I have straight A’s. Who cares.
Thanks for listening to my rant or whatever you could call this idk tbh, if Im being a little bitch and should just get therapy tell me. Idk up to you. Thanks.

I've typed up my symptoms and I'm hoping someone could tell me if it's worth visiting a doctor about? 

&amp;#x200B;

* Can stay up all night and can go days with only a couple of hours sleep and not be tired the next day
* Take on a lot of new projects/hobbies which I spend a lot of money on that I drop after a few weeks 
* Have lots of ideas and plans for the future, my mind is always racing and full of thoughts
* Have periods where I feel really good and happy like life couldn't be better and other periods where I feel extremely depressed
* Get very irritable and angry easily over minor silly things
* Slight paranoia about being watched/followed e.g. cameras in my home, people looking through windows when it's dark, people can read my mind, someone is going to steal my dog when he is in the garden. (I say slight as I know these thoughts are ridiculous but and not true but I guess still worries me enough to be paranoid about it)
* Hallucinations? Seeing things in the corner of my eye, hear voices (only at work) and last week I've smelt things that I shouldn't have smelt in my room (cigarettes and gum - I don't use either)
* Have to check multiple times the tap is off, doors are shut/locked, oven and cooker is off 
* Strong urge to do things - get a tattoo, adopt a pet, clean the house/my room, go for a walk late at night, buy things (normally I don't feel like this)

41,"Maybe I'm a bit old to post on here, but I'm an adult man who has been struggling with long term complex trauma, PTSD, depression, anxiety. I've been to so many therapists, psychologists, support groups, and psychiatrists that I can't keep count anymore. Ultimately nothing has helped, literally not even a small bit. 

In fact I find all the ""treatment"" has hurt me a lot more than helped.  Not counting money hungry practitioners take advantage of my desperation for help, I find the same series of problems over and over again; I have the same arguments about how my treatment isn't helping, how it feels like a one-size-fits-all approach that reduces me as a person down to a cluster of symptoms and labels. I often get treated like I'm stupid, incompetent, or a child by practitioners who invalidate my emotions, thoughts, and perspectives as, ""the product of mental illness"". Or else they give me generic platitudes and a veneer of what often feels to me like vague and disingenuous empathy. 

Ultimately it's been over 10 years with no help and a lot of money spent. All the labels and being told I'm ""just a sick person"" have left me pretty bitter and upset. Medication isn't an option because of a genetic condition, and all the mindfulness/CBT stuff is at best unhelpful, and at worst insulting and demeaning. I don't think I'm able to have help on my terms, or according to my needs. 

I'm so tired of my life and the limitations that my mental health imposes; more and more I want it to be over. I've tried everything I can think of, and for many years I to believed it would eventually help, but it just doesn't. I'm really at the end of my rope. I wish there was something I could do other than just tolerate being internally tortured and miserable 80%-90% of the day, but whenever I ask for help I just get the same empty answers, platitudes, and ""thoughts and prayers"". Fuck I'm tired. I really think I've come to the end of my line.",29Oct2020,1
42,"My friend (we'll call him josh, M25) and I (F24) used to be best friends. We worked together, and we saw each other almost every day and were BFFs for like 2.5 years. We met when things were stable in both of our lives, I had just moved to the city, and it was turning over a new leaf for me mental health wise. I got away from the town and people that made me miserable, and being there helped my depression substantially and quite literally saved my life. 

Josh never really understood everything I went through, and never really quite grasped what it meant to be depressed. He had a lot of family trama in his past that was not unpacked and our friendship was the first time he ever talked about any of it and started to acknowledge the trama he'd gone through (including physical and mental abuse from family that resurged in the time we met). 

Long story short, we had a mutual friend that we met, they started dating and we grew apart because he would always flake on our plans. I confronted him about it, and he admitted the gf was jealous of our friendship and so we couldn't hang out anymore. We ended up having a huge fight over it, I couldn't believe he was 'choosing' his gf over a almost 3 year friendship. Ultimately we had a huge falling out last year around Christmas time and didn't talk for 5 months. 

He reached out at the beginning of the summer, and wanted to make up and said he realized how important I was in his life and regrets ever fighting. I reluctantly accepted the apology, but was clear on how hurt I was, and said if we were to be friends again the expectation is that he reaches out as much as I do. We tried to go back to how things were, but I had moved cities due to covid, and we had to talk on the phone now with a time difference. Things were awkward between us, and he didn't reach out often, so I matched the effort, and we ended up talking maybe once a month. 

So then last week, I get a call from him and he just unloads on me. He and the gf broke up, and he's not doing well in school, and things at home are getting worse, and the financial situation is falling apart, and ultimately told me he's now feeling suicidal. He's never had thoughts like this before, as long as I've known him he's been NT, but I was empathetic, because I've been there, and I know how it feels when things are falling apart. I was clear with him that I have a lot going on in my life that's threatening to bring my own mental health to a really dark place, (I'm back in my home town and it's taking a lot of self care and therapy to stay in a good place), and I can be there as a friend but I don't really have capacity to talk about his mental health. I am also extremely busy, between work, school, and other activities (staying busy keeps bad thoughts away for me), and I genuinely don't have the time to talk to him on the phone for hours. He said he understands and that's fine, but now has reached out to text/call 5x in 3 days. I've been putting him off or ignoring him, and while feel exhausted and guilty, I really just feel like it's not fair of him to put this on me. 

I called 911 the other night after he sent alarming texts, and then texted me this morning thanking me and telling me he's safe. But he just called again, and I really don't have the capacity to handle this. How can I be supportive and delicate of his feelings, but also firm and take care of myself?",29Oct2020,2
43,"I (22, F) started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist (Kaiser Permanente) to get a better handle on my mental health recently after a particularly brief mini-breakdown a few months ago. We initially chalked things up to depression and anxiety alone but ran an ADHD screen test at my request after I accidentally ran across an ADHD forum and felt like it was a plausible possibility. Going through all the posts and comments in that forum, I finally felt completely understood for all the things I thought no one else would really get (including all the little things that caused people to label me as a ""quirky, ditzy, hot mess"").

I'm not sure how much weight there is to these screen tests but I remember scoring a 14/18 on one of them.

My mother recently mentioned that my preschool and elementary school instructors talked to her about the possibility of me having ADHD, but that we never really looked into it for me. 

My psychiatrist has talked to me about getting on Prozac and Klonopin, or Zoloft and Ativan. I reached out to a different psychiatrist within the same network and was suggested to take Wellbutrin.

I was told that it was standard for people who think that they might have ADHD to be prescribed antidepressants and antianxiety medication to rule out the possibility of the problems stemming from depression and anxiety. However, I'm not sure I understand why ADHD meds can't just be prescribed as the initial treatment as both sets of drugs have their share of negative side effects.

Though I'm going through a bit of a rough breakup/ghosting situation at the moment and am having a harder-than-usual time handling things, I wouldn't say that I'm *overly depressive* over the situation to the point where I feel like I'd need medication. But to be clear, the event does drain up a good chunk of my focus by taking up a lot of brain space that I'd otherwise love to have freed up for my daily happenings- I'm also still quite sad about it all (it was much worse during the mini-breakdown episode).

I feel like the majority of my depression and anxiety strongly stem from issues related to ADHD. I get anxious when I compare my progress to those of my peers and somewhat depressive over the fact that I'm really not where I saw myself to be a few years ago- I should have accomplished more by now and I should currently be doing more. I'm upset with my lack of ability to be adequately *functional* and collected. I often feel like I'm just trying to run through viscous honey all the time.

I don't have any predisposition to heart diseases, I exercise pretty regularly, I eat decently, and I'm at a healthy weight for my age and height/build. Were I to take antidepressants and antianxiety medication, I feel like they would only function to placate the symptoms of my struggle vs. actually working to address the problem at its root. 

I'm going to try to summarize as much as possible here since things are getting a bit long:

Throughout elementary school and (now) college, I've always struggled with organizational tasks, time management, and my ability to focus. When micromanaged, I worked fine (GATE/Honors/AP/IB and all, but not without MUCH struggle and my grades showcasing mid/average performance); the micromanaging became increasingly harder to do as I got older. Left to my own devices on my own time, I've had incredible difficulty in prioritizing what needs to get done, actually getting to initiating those tasks, and staying on them until completion. A 4-hour study session mainly consists of me mindlessly reading text over and over again- in those 4 hours, I probably get a solid 1-1.5 hours of actual material absorption. As a result, I grew up having low self-esteem and a strong belief in my ineptitude. Though my friends and peers see that I put in a lot of time and effort into my work, they don't actually see how, in my opinion, much of that that labor is disproportionately reflective of the results I receive. Oddly enough, I will sometimes find myself completely engrossed in random topics of interest without strain. Despite having papers due in the next handful of hours and understanding that those assignments bear huge weight in dictating my overall grade, I can and will go down deep NCBI holes and the like reading research pieces about whatever grips my brain at the moment. I have no problems concentrating there at all- I've forgone sleep and set aside priorities in these moments. 

I should also mention that I'm very prone to missing appointments/commitments (if not missing events altogether, it’s not unusual to find me walking into them late). This has obviously affected many different facets of my life and puts a bit of strain on my relationships with others. My forgetfulness tends to be expensive as I tend to find myself losing/misplacing things on the daily. Lists, charts, apps, and reminders only help so much when I struggle with keeping myself accountable for committing to those resources. 

**1)** I don't feel completely comfortable with taking antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication, but for those of you who have taken them for ADHD, have they helped you? 

**2)** Is it usual for a psychiatrist to prescribe these medications in place of ADHD meds off the bat in cases like mine? I've read around that Kaiser is notorious for not wanting to prescribe stimulants to treat ADHD. 

**3)** If I were to try the Wellbutrin, will it at least help me move on a bit easier from the relationship issues (by numbing me up a little I guess)? It seems that my psychiatrists will not open up to the possibility of treating me with ADHD medication without me trying the antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds first. 

Thank you so much for going through my long post! I'm feeling completely lost as to what I should do at the moment and I'd be immensely appreciative of any and all input you might have!

I haven't had the chance to read through this post because I have an assignment due soon and I find it best to just leave things as they are so I can move on to getting started on my classwork!

46,"Hi all, 

I'll try to keep this brief though I may fail. I'm a 34 year-old person who's suffered from clinical depression &amp; anxiety for over a decade nonstop now. Every single day, every minute, every second. Every passing moment is filled with sadness, tension, fear, the usual. You know the drill. It does not relent. It starts 20 seconds after I wake up &amp; it lasts until my insomniac arse passes out. No fluctuations. 

Recently I've been driven so far into sadness by a particular person that I've been experiencing what I've discovered to be serious dissociation/depersonalition. You know, the looking at my hands &amp; feeling that they're not my hands, catching myself floating above my head in what feels like the third person, feeling like I'm not myself but an imposter in this body, etc. I'd really love to seek help for this &amp; I'm doing my best, but the UK is not known for giving easy mental health care. Anyway, the depersonalisation is pretty new to me. I admit I've never felt it that strongly before. I keep finding myself floating off &amp; 'catching myself' before drifting off like some wayward helium balloon. It was bad. It was really bad. But I live an isolated life &amp; my country is struggling with covid above everything - there is no help to give me. I could not stand it, but I also had no choice. I have no social support to keep me grounded. 

Two days ago something happened that shocked me. I was lying in bed &amp; suddenly all the feelings of depression &amp; anxiety just..stopped. It wasn't a gradual thing. I felt my usual permanent feeling of overwhelming sadness &amp; fear one second, &amp; the next second it was just gone. Gone. Not present. Not there. It had been there for over ten years. Then all of a sudden it wasn't there. 

For the first time in a decade, I felt neutral. For the first time in a decade I did not feel sad or afraid. Prior to this I've done therapy, psychotherapy, taken every single kind of antidepressant, done cbt, read &amp; enacted every single self help book - nothing cured it. 

But I was just lying in bed &amp; a switch flipped. The sadness disappeared. The anxiety disappeared. I didn't feel happy but I felt -relieved-. I felt like I had a hundred thorns suddenly removed from my skin all at once. I lay there &amp; thought 'wow I don't know what this is but it feels amazing'. I read my book &amp; for the first time in years, I enjoyed it. I read it &amp; got thoroughly sucked into the story as opposed to struggling to engage with the words. It felt good. I kept saying to myself 'I don't know what this is but it will probably wear off in 5 minutes so just enjoy it'. 

It didn't wear off. I thought 'okay this will wear off in an hour, enjoy it'. It didn't. I thought ""okay this will be gone by the morning'. 

When I woke up the next morning the neutral feeling was still there. Instead of being absolutely bloody swamped with sadness &amp; fear 20 seconds after waking like I always do, I felt..nothing. no sadness. No fear. Just neutrality. 

It's been over 48 hours now &amp; I feel neutral. 

How is it possible for clinical depression &amp; clinical anxiety to disappear in an instant?

I'm assuming it's not possible. I'm assuming that recent traumas (I've just gone through a year &amp; a half of severe emotional torture) has done something to my brain. I'm assuming it's made my brain turn off all emotions somehow. I haven't stopped feeling depressed because I'm cured; i stopped because it's been so extreme lately that some part of my brain has gone 'noooooope' &amp; just hit the killswitch. 

Right now I don't feel sadness. I don't feel fear. I don't feel anything. I really like it because it's such a relief,  but I recognise this might be a little alarming. I've gone from a depressed sad anxious wreck to a chill unfeeling rock overnight. 

The thought of leaving my house, travelling long distances, talking to people etc used to give me a panic attack. Just three days ago. Now I think about the exact same stimulus &amp; I feel no fear. Just 'meh sounds alright'. 

Three days ago I was an overthinking remorseful guilt-ridden anxious wreck. Today, I feel like I don't even have a conscience. Three days ago I would not say boo to a goose for fear of sounding rude. Today, I feel I could wring the goose's neck &amp; not give a crap. 

No sadness. No fear. No guilt. No remorse. No beating myself up. No internal criticism. No fucks given. Nothing. Whenever I think about something that would normally make me feel angry or sad, i feel like an empty lighter. The button is pressed, the flint produces a spark, but since there's no gas the fire doesn't start. There's a blockage. 

I am able to laugh. I found merriment in little things. Jokes in YouTube videos, films, etc. The only problem is, I haven't laughed at those things in years. 

After a decade of severe depression, this feels absolutely wonderful. But I am very cognisant of the fact that for this to happen overnight may not be normal. 

What the hell just happened? Did i just become emotionless in self defence? Any insight or thoughts would be welcome.",29Oct2020,1

I have like this tunnel vision and bright lights are way to bright. It’s also like I have a heavy foggy head. My head feels like it weight a lot. I feel mentally slow too. This is stressing me out and scares me. I know I am real and I know that everything around me is real too. I have no question about that. It’s really weird I’m constantly tired and feel like something is not right. It gets worse sometimes but also sometimes for a brief moment I “snap out of it” and everything goes back to “normal” but right back to the fog after. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I have tried grounding too and that does not shake it off.  I have never felt this way before and I’m fact this is the most happiness I have been my entire life, minus this foggy bit.

49,"Hi i just turned 20(m) and I’m in my first semester of junior year of college, I recently got over 7 years of depression and self hatred since I was 14 because of an emotionally abusive relationship with my mother who constantly put me down as I was going through highschool and neglected me my first years in college. My first two years of college were absolutely horrible because of my mental health and now I just want to get better this time around. I’m improving by gaining hobbies and becoming more open with friends but I have an issue with doing my schoolwork and committing to myself because a large part of my abuse came from my mom telling me i wasn’t going to be anything in life, it got to me and I gave up on myself entirely. I really want to graduate on time (maybe early if possible) but I’m sure I’m behind on credits so I’m just asking for healthy schoolwork and commitment habits so that I can get better grades and keep cultivating healthy growth with myself. Sorry if this is a lot to read but I would just like advice on how to grow. I’ve made improvements with myself but I want to get better soon so I can start my own life on a better path.

A few minutes later, a few comments began popping up here and there, calling me various rude names and utterly insulting me. I try to tell them how they’re wrong, and that I’m not looking for an argument, but that only fueled it more.

After more vile posts were made, I became worried and deleted the post. But it doesn’t end there. More time passes and they still manage to message me damaging letters and I don’t know how to block them now, since I didn’t do it before I deleted the post.

52,"On Sunday of last week, an attorney was contacted by my daughter, who said was tired of being emotionally and physically abused by my ex-wife. On Monday, my ex-mother-in-law drove my daughter to the attorney's office, where the three of them had a sit-down. On Tuesday, the attorney filed for an emergency *ex parte* hearing. Today, that hearing took place. My daughter will be living with her grandmother (my ex-mother-in-law) for the foreseeable future. Another hearing, in a month's time, will make this a permanent arrangement.

During the hearing, I learned the details of the abuse that my daughter had endured. The abuse had been going on for *years*, apparently, and no one knew. The grandmother didn't know. I didn't know. My ex-wife's boyfriend knew; he was part of it. His daughter (my daughter's 'stepsister') knew; she was a victim of it. The therapist knew and had threatened to call CPS at least once. My ex-wife is apparently a violent alcoholic who leaves recreational drugs and alcohol where my daughter can access them. I can't list the things she did. I just can't. I can't type them out. She was sexually assaulted on two or more occasions, but she doesn't want to say who did it. All she will say is that the abuser or abusers aren't people we know.

Bruises, scratches, being thrown against the wall, being told she's not mentally ill, being denied her medication, ... Being told that her self-harming is merely a cry for attention... Being told, when she's suicidal, to cut that s\*\*\* out because there's housework to be done...  That poor girl!

Fortunately, and much to her credit, *she came forward*. Now, 72 hours later, she's living in a place of safety with someone who loves her unconditionally. 

She's old enough to know whether she wants me in her life or not. She doesn't. My life is too chaotic. I've respected her wishes. Still, her grandmother and I talk regularly. I do what I can to provide emotional and financial support. That child does not deserve this kind of treatment. No child does.

Until now, I've resisted the urge to speak ill of my ex-wife when she isn't here to defend herself. I'm minded to maintain that attitude in public. The woman is ill, she needs psychiatric help, she needs to see an addiction counselor, and she needs plenty of compassion. Still, I... I want to hurt her. It isn't very nice of me to have these thoughts, but I want her to suffer. I'll take those feelings, stuff them into a little box, and throw that box into the harbor. I'll pray for her speedy recovery.

The important thing is that my daughter is safe and happy (happier).",29Oct2020,1
53,"I’ll probably delete this but I just wanted to share how excited I am since one of my AH friends ruined it.

I’ve been off and on depressed for at least 6 years maybe longer and I finally am in the position where I can get on antidepressants + finally had the courage to ask my doctor!

I wanted to when I was in high school but my parents were against it because my birth mom was an addict and they hated any kind of medication that wasn’t absolutely necessary. I spent the last 2 years (I’m 20 now) wanting to go on them but always had an excuse not to. 

I finally broke down this week and called the doctor. I was so scared since everyone in my life has been so against it and made me feel shame about wanting them. And let me tell you, it was the most validating experience of my life.

I started out defensive, explaining I’ve tried therapies, eating healthy, exercising, a strict sleeping schedule, drinking water; if it’s been a suggested solution online I’ve tried it, trying to prove to him that those things weren’t causing it (because thats where everyone in my life has sent me when I tried to open up.) He politely ignored (ignored isn’t the right word? he didn’t feel the need to question if I “really” needed it is what I mean) all that and started asking about my feelings, and immediately trying to narrow down what could be causing it. 

I’ve always been lead to believe I’m a hypochondriac in trying to figure out what’s wrong with me. Something I kept coming back to was bipolar depression. He didn’t say he thought I had it, but he noticed I explained some manic episodes (which I originally thought were manic episodes but then thought I was me being a hypochondriac) and said he’ll keep bipolar depression in mind but we weren’t going to start acting like it was that just yet. It was just so validating to find out that I wasn’t picking at straws and was actually showing signs of that. It made me feel less crazy.

He prescribed me Prozac and told me to come back in 2 weeks. I’m more hopeful than I’ve been since I started therapy when I was 12. I know this won’t start working immediately and may not even be the right medication. But it feels so good to be starting the journey to contentment. 

Thanks for reading. Like I said I’ll probably delete this. I just wanted to share my happiness with someone. Sorry if this is fast and jumbled. I just laid down for bed and just wanted to get it off my chest. Especially cause I was ending the night thinking about how angry I was at my friend for ignoring my excitement.)",29Oct2020,1
55,"2 years of working for a company and I’m afraid I might lose everything

Been living with my girlfriend the last 4 years. I’ve been working for a company making a little more than minimum wage. It’s a well known company and have made a good name for myself there until the last week. I only have 2K to pay off on my car and i will own it. I have 4K in my 401 K I have a high school diploma but have never went to college. I’m 24 but my only chance of not being homeless is continuing to better my life and work towards my future with my girlfriend. I have an apartment no kids plenty of clothes a dog and a girl that cares about me. I’ve been on prescription medication the last 2 years and it worked tremendously. Unfortunately I lost 20 lbs on it and my physical features have looked as if I’ve been doing heavy opiates. I’ve been working so hard to get to were I am in life at this moment but the worst part is this depression cloud has been covering me the last 2 weeks while trying to get off of it. My mental state hasn’t been right. I don’t want to put bills and responsibilities on my girlfriend and I’m just embarrassed that I’ve gotten to this point. I don’t want to lose everything but the depression cloud is saying fuck it. I have a chance to man up and talk to my boss tomorrow who has a nephew with opiate problems. Should I swallow my pride and bite the bullet and go in tomorrow to ask them about my future with the company? I understand losing a job isn’t the end of the world but at the same time if I lose everything and start at 0 again I will be so disappointed with myself. I’ve been on a medication called suboxone the last 2 years and with a mix of adderall I abused both medications and lost my fire of bettering myself. I need advice and or help from someone. Please lmk what you guys think. I sound like a whiny ass but I haven’t been truly depressed in years and the worst part I feel is I want to be depressed. I’ve always been irresponsible. Having actually adulthood and life on my plate is swallowing me up. Idk what is wrong with me.

56,"I'm a 17 year old guy in my senior year of high school. My grades are straight F's because I don't even log into school because I just sleep. I work barely any hours at work but it feels like an eternity awaits when I walk into the minimum wage prison of that grocery store. I have no motivation in life, ever since the 7th grade my mental health has been declining just as much as my grades, I have severe panic attacks where I'll get up and start screaming and running around my room even though in my head I know I'm losing it for no reason. I have a great social life hanging out with friends and just doing dumb shit while drinking and smoking. When I'm going down the road in the back bed of my friends truck with a whole bunch of my friends with me listening to music, every thing just becomes weightless, I don't feel bulletproof but I feel untouchable if that makes sense. Nothing other than being with my friends and family interests me in life. I love my dad and mom to death and all of my family, they try to motivate me to do better but I just sit on my ass and watch the days tick down until I can't do anything about my grades or life as a whole. I don't feel suicidal but I think when I hit that point where I can't fix what I've done, I will be. But I know that I'll never fix what I've messed up in the first place. My happiest place is working on my car, my cars engine blew up and I rebuilt the engine completely by hand with my father and soon we will see if it starts and runs, rebuilding that piece of iron and aluminum has given me more fulfillment in life than what I've felt in years...

I have no talents or skills other than my mechanical loving sponge of a brain and I probably would have loved going to a mechanical engineering college class, but with my terrible grades across all school years, I know it will never happen. It sucks knowing that I won't get to live a life with the comfort of income and success. I'll most likely just be working minimum wage for the rest of my life and that hurts to know. I have no clue what to do, I feel that if I could experience love and be able to share my feelings and just hold someone I would get some motivation, but then again, I know I'll probably never get a girlfriend within the time frame that would help make a difference in my motivation for school.

Anyway, over the past 2 months of us being back together, I have discovered that randomly, out of no where, i get a sudden wave of intense, dramatic, sadness. Seriously, out of no where. I have no current diagnosed mental illness’s but I wasnt sure where to post this. (I have been trying to set up a therapist appointment but struggling because of covid). 

The best way i can describe it is like a perfectly sunny day, and out of no where its thunderstorming above my head. And then, 15 minutes later, back to normal and sunny. Its like I cry heavily for no reason during this wave and I say things to my boyfriend like “please dont leave me” and he has been reassuring me but I do know that repeatedly begging my boyfriend not to leave me when not even 5 minutes earlier, everything was good, is super toxic and it needs to stop. But I have tried everything and I cant just stop this negativity no matter what I do. And I try to not say anything to my boyfriend, but he obviously can see me crying, so of course he asks!

59,"A weird and stressful situation about quizzes &amp; accommodations - advice?

I have this math class that I feel has been causing me so much stress that (maybe this is TMI but it concerns me) have had very abnormal or no periods at all and great acne breakouts throughout my face. I’ve talked to a medical professional about some of these concerns and he diagnosed me with anxiety. I feel so rough and I don’t know how to continue on from here. 

In this math class, I have about 50 questions for homework due every few days. I feel like I can manage this part pretty okay - because I can use my notes, use a calculator, and ask for help if I feel like I need it. 

On top of the HW, we have these worksheets with class material on them that have about an additional 50 questions to learn and know how to do.

Every week, though, we have 2.5 minutes to solve around 3 questions for a quiz. These questions will either be a bit different than the questions we have seen in class or nothing that we have ever seen before. 

I haven’t been doing too well on these quizzes. And I’ve asked for more practice problems and have been told that I can’t get additional practice problems for them. 

Recently got a quiz back with the comment that I shouldn’t leave additional work I did to solve for the problem on the paper, but was told by the same grader that I would get points taken off if I didn’t show my work / reasoning. Nothing against her, but I’m so confused as to what to do and frustrated. 

I felt like I didn’t deserve them at first, but I recently made the decision to apply for accommodations to get more time on these quizzes. I feel this painful worrying in my chest when I do them, as I feel like my future is slipping away with each question that I answer. 

I was wondering - would it be too much to ask for study guides that would have problems that are in the same format as the questions on the quiz? As in, the only big difference would be that some of the numbers are changed out and all. 

I already feel bad for thinking of asking about it - but I can’t remember to solve for a problem that I’ve never seen before or remember how to solve a question that is somewhat like one of the 120 questions that we’ve done.

TL;DR - Recently been receiving great stress and anxiety about these hard quizzes with problems we’ve never seen before - that have to be answered in 2.5 minutes. Applying for testing accommodations after recently being diagnosed with anxiety. Would it be too much to ask for a study guide for these quizzes with problems that are very similar to ones we could expect to see on the quiz?",29Oct2020,1
60,"Hey, I'm not sure how to exactly format this, but I'll try to make it separate based on each problem that affects me.

I feel average to compared to everyone else, and everybody has me 1 upped in something I enjoy doing. I know this is sort of selfish of me, and I know that everyone has their own talents and weaknesses. 

My anger management is poor. I can get mad at the smallest things. Playing video games is fun, but it's not fun when you are always dying and losing all your shit. Everybody in my friend group is playing this one game having fun, but I'm not enjoying it at all. They are way ahead of me and I feel like dead weight to them. It makes me feel like all I care is about myself and make them help me. I don't want to experience that. I would drop the game, but that's all they play nowadays. 

I have trouble expressing myself to my closest friends and family. This is mainly because it's just overall hard to talk with them about serious things. I don't want to talk to my family because I feel like I'll just be a burden and I don't want them to worry about me that much. On the other hand, my friends never take anything seriously, and it has created this sort of atmosphere where it's just a bunch of aggressive jokes thrown at each other in which I partake. I just hate that I can't communicate with my only true friends. It's hard to break down this barrier because if I express myself it would feel really awkward, especially out of nowhere. I really want to talk to them about my issues, but I don't know how to approach it. I enjoy talking about serious stuff at times, but most times I stray away from doing that.

Sometimes, I do feel worthless and there is nothing to live for. It's these rare moments that make me wonder if I'm better off killing myself. I know, I know, ask people for help, but I have no money to get the help I need. I don't want to use my parent's money either as well. I want someone that I feel is worth living to me. Don't get me wrong, I do love my friends and family, but I want to feel a connection with someone. Someone I can always rely and talk to about these things. I'm too young for any kind of relationship anyway, so it doesn't matter. I would sometimes wonder if I should actually just end it all, and if I even have the balls to do it. How would I do it, what would happen after. Pointless, meaningless life. Again, these thoughts happen from time to time, not consistently.

I’ve been close to crying several times in those lessons due to moments like this, but I’m so scared to open up and express myself in my music. More so, I’m afraid to express myself to my peers due to fear of judgement.

This extends to every aspect of my life. I can only express positive emotions around my mom and everyone except my dad. My dad is okay to be vulnerable around, but everyone else is an unknown and I’m so used to shoving those feelings down that I’m afraid of what will happen when they finally break the dam. They’re shoved so deep that I’m hardly aware of them unless I’m having a moment like this, and while I know they exist, I know my interaction with my own negative emotion is extremely unhealthy. This is made even worse by the fact that I’m not “traumatized” by any sense of the word, at least in my definition. I don’t know if I am or not from an objective point of view.

I can talk to my therapist about it, but I don’t see her for another week. It’s every other week.

this may be a long post but i really, really need help. 
basically, it feels like there’s a big ol void where my most critical skills i need to function should be, like complex thinking / intellectual skills, making judgements and being able to have cool and creative ideas, proper social and communicational skills and imaginative / deep thinking skills. i have very concrete thoughts, if i have any, and as hard as i try i can not form any type of opinion or original idea when being spoken to. it’s quite humiliating really, and as a result i’ve become quite detached from society and don’t really have many close relationships because i feel like i’m not capable. 
my mind constantly feels blocked, or like i have intense “brain fog”. it feels like there is a wall inside of it that doesn’t allow information, ideas or original thoughts to pass through. i just literally have. no. thoughts. i feel like a complete idiot all of the time, i don’t feel the slightest bit intelligent. my mind feels both full and empty at the same time, and i’m struggling to see how i can live a meaningful life this way, i feel like i’m missing out on the whole life experience. 
i’m currently in rehab being treated for severe depression, but i honestly believe that while depression is definitely piggybacking on whatever other issue it is i have, it’s not the root of it. what caused me to become depressed is i’ve come to realise how incompetent in so many aspects of my life i am and become aware of how limited my thought patterns are and how stuck for words and ideas i always am, with no idea how i’m meant to change or why i am this way. existence is so f***ing painful, i just want this feeling to end.

Hubby, today, insisted on going to the mechanic shop where the car is and getting everything that we own out of it so the shop can junk it. That means we had to say goodbye to The Babe (the car's name...don't ask...please). I was fine until they had taken us back to the bay where she was sitting on a jack, looking like nothing was wrong with her. I started sobbing my heart out, making the mechanics all stare at me with pity and sadness in their eyes. We took a picture of her, then I video chatted with our 21 year old daughter (the one in NY State) so she could say goodbye to her baby. I sobbed uncontrollably the whole time I was on the phone with her. I can't say goodbye. I started a GoFundMe, but I felt so guilty and wrong for asking for money for something like that when there are people on there trying to get money for valid reasons, like cancer treatments or other health conditions. I have no right to ask for anything...and my heart is broken. I want to self-harm so badly that I literally have to keep myself on this bed so I don't go do it. I don't want to eat, and I can't sleep. All I see is our car...abandoned and sad now. I KNOW a car can't have emotions...

66,"I’ve always seen medication as a last resort just because of possible negative side effects.  I’ve worked my way up from self-treatment (diet, exercise, and routines) to talk therapy to treat anxiety.  Although I’m doing much better now than I was before I started treatment, I still have intrusive thoughts, I pick at my skin constantly, and I find my way out of even the very few social engagements that are still happening.  Sometimes I feel so overwhelmed that I just lie in bed and do nothing for hours.  It’s partially the pandemic messing up my routines, but it’s partially just me.  

I don’t have a formal diagnosis because I see a graduate student in training to be a therapist because it’s way cheaper than a real therapist and I don’t have a lot of money.  I don’t think the grad students are able to give diagnoses.  They definitely can’t prescribe medication so I would have to find a doctor for that.

Another layer to this is that I’ve been anxious for so long, I don’t really have a baseline “normal” to compare to.  Is this how everyone feels?  Is this a healthy amount of anxious? I honestly have no clue.  Some of my friends who went on anti-depressants have told me that they didn’t even realize that other people didn’t feel like that all the time - they were so used to being depressed they thought it was normal.

I’m really proud of the progress I’ve made but I wonder if I could feel even better.  The only thing I haven’t tried is medication.  I plan to bring it up at my next session but I wanted to know what you’re experiences have been with this process/how you knew it was time for you.",29Oct2020,1
67,"Hi friends 
Like everyone else in the world, 2020 has hit me like a ton of bricks. I’ve always been an “anxious person” but I never considered that I may actually have anxiety as a condition. Looking back, there are a couple of things I’m noticing now. One of them is that I’ve always had a high pulse rate. As 2020 has just gotten worse and worse, so have my feelings of anxiousness. Now I get pretty frequent heart palpitations. However in the past I’ve just always had a racing heart. For example, I donate plasma. For legal reasons they have to REALLY make sure you’re safe before you donate, so they take temp, iron levels, pulse, and other things. More often than not I would get turned away because my pulse was higher than 100 (usually like 107). Could this be due to a resting state of anxiety that I never knew I had? Like I said, only about a month ago did I start having a conversation like, “hey, you might not just be a ‘worry wart’ you might actually have anxiety” so I’m not even sure what I think is happening. I started to have panic attacks and finally my parents and boyfriend told me it was time for the doctor. I’ve just always felt nervous/anxious/worried so I’ve almost gaslighted myself into thinking that there’s nothing wrong, it’s just my brain. I’m going to the doctor in about a month and I’m just nervous he’ll prescribe meds I “don’t need” even though it clearly seems like I need them. Has anyone else ever felt this way?

69,"I {22M} with Autism and several disabilties and anxiety, am extremely attached to my mother.

Due to the severe abuse from my father, my mother was a person i confided in. Since i was a kid i have been attached to her. When she went on vacation i cried everyday, when she goes somewhere for a long time i get anxious and sad. I feel she is the meaning of my life and she is the only person who actually cares about me and loves me, she is the person who validates my moderate Autism and disability. As i've got older i have got more capable of dealing with my emotions about her, but i still worry sick if she ever dies. I have no solution or plan with my life if she dies, her death would probably mean poverty for me or domestic violence in my brothers household. i always mentally tell myself to soothe myself, that if she dies, i can just end my life and it'll all be okay.

this is not just another ''immature mommy bois'' story, without her i am literally nothing. My whole identity and life depends on her. I often self harm when we have arguments because i feel i let her down. please give me advice on what to do if she dies in the near future? remember i am not a neuroptpyical person, i have moderate disabiltiies that impair me from living alone and impair me from living a independent life",29Oct2020,1

My hometown stresses me out, because my parents have taken my coming out awfully, and I had forced conversion therapy here. I want to leave and forget about it all. I am also very lonely, and am bored because of the lack of novel stimulation (no new places/people/activities). I probably should have left earlier, but college is free.

Just like all of you I too am a victim of the gruesome realities of what our minds and world's have created.

*This one's a long, but I do know these words you're about to read will absolutely become a tactic to battle the evils and delusions we are all guilty of creating.*

With what is going on:

A lot of people do feel like they have this disconnect from the world &amp; believing they have no one there for support or comfort.. this should be seen as an opportunity to really self evaluate how you want to mold yourself for the upcoming future. 

Please take this time to slow down, pace yourself, learn your strengths and weaknesses, become one with yourself and learn how to give yourself support and comfort.

Strengthen your will, mind &amp; body.... *Find balance before you seek peace, Learn your weaknesses before you seek strength, learn your enemies before you seek allies.*

Because a day will come when you will have to go to war with your self (everyone does), &amp; it will be you and you only who will suffer the losses and accept the victories.. you will have to be the one who supports yourself and comfort yourself remember that...

Once you realize that, you'll realize that you were building yourself a bridge that connects you back to the world or universe this whole time..

*New friends await when you seek self-love and not attention.*

*New families await when you realize loyalty makes you family not blood.*

*New journeys await once the traveller opens the wings to the next destination.*

And 

*A new chapter awaits when you're ready to flip the page..*


I really hope this helps you and anyone else who might've needed to read or hear this, please discuss any of the battles you're currently going through,


 2020 was the year where I hit complete rock bottom..

even though you hit rock bottom you dig yourself a deeper hole when you allow your emotions to take control of your thoughts and actions..

 accept the losses for what they were and spread the ashes of the fallen battles towards a better a future..

 happiness doesn't come from fixing the past, doesn't come from the sun or moon, it comes from within. Don't ever try to edit yourself. Accept your self.


Ego is the temporary solution to pride. 


Anger is the temporary solution to destruction.


Greed is the temporary solution to false fortune.

78,"Sorry in advance for the read. It’s lengthy, but any answers, help, or guidance, is very appreciated. 

So. It’s truly an incredibly long story as to how I ended up where I did, last year. I fell into a state of major depression and psychosis. For 7 months I thought I was schizophrenic because of the things that were happening to me. I hid from the world and when I did have to face the world, I was an Emmy award winning actor. It took a very long time for me to get help and when I did I was diagnosed with major depression with severe mood congruent psychotic features. After some medications I was sought to be cured. 

Is it possible to suffer from PTSD, from this kind of life event? Almost exactly a year ago is when I finally started to feel better. However, Last night I was binge watching a tv show. In the final few episodes, my favourite character had something happen to them, which lead to episodes of similar instances that I’ve endured. Evidently the character was checked into a psychiatric ward before the season concluded. I was a mess watching it. Essentially, I’m emotionally stunted, so nothing ever brings me to tears. But last night, it did. 

Today at work, all I could think about was that episode. I started to feel weird. And on my lunch break I had a full blown anxiety and panic attack. Freaking out. Bawling. Punching my dash. I felt similar to as i did last year. Although I am still far from how dark I was last year, my current mindset and last years mindset have been starting to see eye to eye again. I have never seen a mental health related tv topic since my dark days, until now. When people talk about severe mental illness, it always makes me internally panic. I feel as though the world is just waiting for me to crumble again. 

Is this ptsd? Am I just a mentally ill person?",29Oct2020,1

88,"Hi, I guess this is a topic everyone talks about here, I just wanna post my story, in order to feel that there's an interaction with someone out there on the web. English is not my native language, sorry for any mistakes. 

I'm 21 years old, I live in Honduras, and I don't feel alright. I'll start from my middle school life because in primary school I was okay. 
You have to know that here in Honduras, schools are small and bilingual schools like mine are even smaller, so every classmate is like half-a-sibling for you. But, I've never felt that type of bond with them, (I'm a single child) so it was rough actually engaging in normal after-school activities with them.
To clarify, I never considered anyone my friend, worst a best friend.

So, puberty happens. And I start liking a girl in 8th grade, let's call her Cookie. (important info, my dad made the typical American dream migration to the U.S. when I was 5, I feel this is a reason I didn't know what to do regarding girls in that moment)
I liked Cookie a lot, so I always tried to get in pairs with her whenever we had lectures and that stuff.

Now, we're in 9th grade, and I've been trying to get in a relationship with her, you know, cheek kisses and hanging out. But here's come the tricky part, I'm the most insecure and shy person to her eyes.

So I get friendzoned (now being older I know this is an excuse for coping with rejection) and I didn't want that. I wanted to feel special special in her eyes, which I was, but only like a friend, not like his confident.
This hurt me a lot, I felt that no matter what I did, I was never going to be someone special to her, so I avoided her. She didn't get it at the beginning, she just thought I was being quiet, but I made sure that she notice I talked to everyone except her.  It got to a point it was the first time I got called to the office, for the teachers to know what was happening, it was noticeable my disdain against her. I avoided her from latter half of 9th grade until the end of 10th grade.",29Oct2020,1

I keep focusing on their every move and if they follow the things given to them. When they don't, I get furious.

* Can stay up all night and can go days with only a couple of hours sleep and not be tired the next day
* Take on a lot of new projects/hobbies which I spend a lot of money on that I drop after a few weeks 
* Have lots of ideas and plans for the future, my mind is always racing and full of thoughts
* Have periods where I feel really good and happy like life couldn't be better and other periods where I feel extremely depressed
* Get very irritable and angry easily over minor silly things
* Slight paranoia about being watched/followed e.g. cameras in my home, people looking through windows when it's dark, people can read my mind, someone is going to steal my dog when he is in the garden. (I say slight as I know these thoughts are ridiculous but and not true but I guess still worries me enough to be paranoid about it)
* Hallucinations? Seeing things in the corner of my eye, hear voices (only at work) and last week I've smelt things that I shouldn't have smelt in my room (cigarettes and gum - I don't use either)
* Have to check multiple times the tap is off, doors are shut/locked, oven and cooker is off 
* Strong urge to do things - get a tattoo, adopt a pet, clean the house/my room, go for a walk late at night, buy things (normally I don't feel like this)

Literally out of NOWHERE, all of a sudden I was feeling stressed, lonely, anxious, extremely fluctuation moods. I was needy in a way that I never have been before with friends and family. I flagrantly missed work deadlines, was extremely flaky in general, and thought that I had developed feelings for a guy overnight. There have been consequences, and I am still working to remedy some of the conflicts I created. I would say that usually I am a confident, motivated person who keeps busy (and obviously has the occasional bad day), but this was unlike any kind of ""feeling bad"" I have experienced before. It felt like there was a literal weight on my heart, and I realize now I was just seeking validation from all my friends/family/ the guy. 

I didn't even realize that \^\^ all that was happening until this week, because all of a sudden I am feeling like my normal self again. And now I feel EMBARASSED. I have sent texts to my closest friends individually asking if they felt as though I have been off recently and they all have responded saying they thought I was just having an ""off"" week or two. 

This kind of behavior is not normal for me at all. And it's scary how in hindsight, I just woke up one day feeling like shit, felt like shit for 2 weeks, and then woke up one day earlier this week feeling normal again.

I fantasized about being on facetime with my boyfriend while “getting the news” and then telling him and getting his reaction. I hate to admit it but part of me wants things to happen so I will receive attention. When I get close to someone (like a significant other or best friend) I like to open up to them (as supposed to a stranger) to get sympathy/empathy/compassion from them. I vent to my boyfriend a lot and he helps me through some of my troubles and struggles (and vice versa, this is not one sided at all) and I really enjoy the attention that I get from him. I feel really fucked up, like I know this is awful behavior but I have no clue why I crave this. I don’t want to self diagnose or get anything into my head but I would like answers. Is there any specific disorder or mental illness that would explain? I want to talk to a therapist or psychiatrist soon to get an actual diagnosis.",29Oct2020,1

105,"I'm a guy and I have crazy body image issues that have started becoming a problem.

I used to think I was really fucking attractive (cause I was dating someone who I thought was attractive, and therefore I HAD to be attractive as well). But it's been a long time since then, and since I'm not being hit on or receiving attention or hooking up, I've slowly come to the conclusion that I'm ugly. There are other factors that have helped me confirm this suspicion.

Since I place so much value on my own looks, being hit with the realization that I'm ugly has messed me up. I legitimately feel like there's no point in being alive since I'm always so miserable because I'm not attractive. I might not actually be depressed (I had episodes for unrelated reasons and this doesn't feel the same) but I'm basically permanently sad and only alive because there's no alternative.

But my bar to be found attractive again is unrealistic. I NEED to be constantly hooking up, catcalled, hit on by strangers, complimented, have anonymous confessions on my university facebook page etc. Or date someone attractive. And being ""attractive"" won't do, I need to be the most attractive guy in any given room. That's slowly coming down to amongst the top % of guys but still, very high bar..

And I know that rationally speaking everything I'm saying makes no sense: ""looks are subjective"", ""ratings make no sense"", ""beauty doesn't mean THAT much"" but still, I need it. Idk what to do, I can only get external validation and I'm convinced that no counsellor can help me overcome this, nor do I have the money for it.

I've been asked to consider TMS and the nasal ketamine thing, but both make me uncomfortable, even though I know there's no real reason to be. I'm just bad at dealing with medical things, and recently finding out after restarting seroquel at a 400mg dose and experiencing a severe reaction (shivers, hallucinations, motor impairment, panic attack,) that medications only work on 1/3rd of the population, work permanently for no one, can cause lots of damage if thrown at you all at once as a ""try everything til something works"" approach (especially if you're misdiagnosed,) and doctors have absolutely no idea why they work at all on the few that do get temporary benefits, I've been made really uncomfortable by medical treatment and more worried about what it's doing to me since it's not working. In regards to TMS itself, I'm generally over-worried about the 4 week startong process creating a lot of changes that'll last for months before knowing if it works for me, and the thought that I'd have to do TMS for the rest of my life, even if only once every couple months, as well as some of the side effects like headaches that last the first 2 weeks.

114,"I always hear people talking about their depression/anxiety talking; hearing an inner voice say “I’m worthless” “I’m a failure” and other negative thoughts that are controlling them. I don’t have these thoughts. Negative or positive. I just don’t think in verbal thoughts at all. Instead my thoughts about myself are blank. If I’m down I just feel down but I don’t know if I’m down because I’m thinking I’m a nuisance, guilty of some imaginary crime, or what.

I’ve struggled to make any progress with my therapist on my mental health and I feel like some of that’s due to my inability to hear an inner voice. As I understand it, a big way to fight against depression/anxiety is to change how one views themself. But hearing and comprehending ones own internal dialogue seems integral to that. Since I can’t hear that voice I don’t really know how I view myself asides from feeling like I’m falling short of the mark all the time.

Furthermore, I find it hard to implement positive thinking (replacing “I will” with “I am” etcetera) because that internal dialogue has just never been apparent in my mind and I don’t know how I’d start implementing it now.

I have been diagnosed with ADHD (ADD really) which might be responsible for my missing internal dialogue but I don’t really know. I also think I might be experiencing something akin to aphantasia (inability to visualize mental images) as I can’t easily picture things in my mind and really struggle to remember what things look like and I wonder if that could be playing a role. To clarify, my mind isn’t entirely blank. Just devoid of any verbal inner dialogue about myself and lacking visual flair, but I do tend to daydream a lot, (which is a symptom of ADHD and I’m pretty certain I’m a maladaptive daydreamer). Very often I daydream of theoretical interactions—past, present and future—with other people, except I mold the presentation of me into my subconsciously perceived best version of myself. I understand I do this because I feel insufficient in how I present myself. That I could’ve said that better, I could’ve had more confident body language, or I should respond like so in that potential scenario. This is my only clue as to how I view myself, which is usually just a vague assumption that I must not be good enough for whatever reason.

117,"This is probably a stupid question, Im curious if it is possible to get antidepressants without having to see a therapist regularly. 

Its not that I don’t want to talk to a therapist, its that I don’t “have a reason to be depressed”. Therefore, I would have nothing to talk about every session. 

When I was 14, I was put into therapy for a couple years for self harm. My therapist wanted to diagnose me with depression but my parents claimed I was not depressed &amp; that I needed to “get over it”. During my last session, my therapist told me I was 5 times more likely to develop depression as an adult than my peers. She wanted me to keep my eyes open to it, though Im not even sure what depression is supposed to be like. 

Since then, I went back to therapy (age 22) last year for one session. I was extremely suicidal, wouldn’t shower for days, barely ate or would over eat, etc. Im an incredibly anxious person so I already went into the office feeling like I did something wrong/crying. The therapist went over everything in my life, which Im happy for everything. Im living the life of my dreams. I have the job Ive always wanted, the home Ive always wanted, the car, the family, everything. This therapist laughed at me &amp; said, “you have no reason to be depressed. You’re too young. Paint your walls bright colors, open your windows &amp; go outside for Christ sakes.”

I left, &amp; never looked back. To be honest, I often wonder if its all in my head. The anxiety just has a hay day with that whole therapy interaction I had &amp; I don’t ever want to see anyone again because Im “self diagnosing”. So maybe I don’t even have depression..? If I don’t, then maybe I’m just incredibly lazy &amp; an idiot for posting here. 

The thing is, I only do things when it’s absolutely necessary. If I don’t need to leave the house for 2 weeks, I spend that whole time in bed. I have no motivation to shower, or eat, or see anyone. Im like a...functional-but-not depressed person? Its been going on like this since I was 14. Its just only gotten worse over the years being on my own, but the suicidal tendencies have gone away when I left my ex. 

Im not sure if Ive just found a way to get by while also just never leaving my bed. I want to live the life where I take a shower because its basic care, &amp; I actually go out &amp; enjoy old hobbies. Ive gained 75lbs since I gave up on martial arts back in January. I had done it for years. But now, Im constantly bothered that I have no motivation to do anything. I sleep for 16 hours, eat garbage, then go back to sleep. When I have to leave my house, I constantly count down the time to when I can be in bed again. Its not fun. 

Im also torn between wanting help, but also not wanting help. I feel meds might be helpful, but I literally don’t have a reason to be depressed where I would need to see a therapist. I just feel it’d be a waste of time, money, &amp; time away from my bed. I don’t even have a family doctor because Id rather not leave my house. I was suppose to find one when I was 18, Im 23 now so I can’t just call up asking for a prescription. It also doesn’t help that almost all drs aren’t taking anyone new because of COVID.

118,"I haven’t posted on here in a while and I thought I would post a little check up. 

I suffer with Anxiety, Panic disorder, depression and an eating disorder. 
(For those who want to know, I am not medicated nor am i no longer in therapy, I work with this all on my own as I refused medication) 

It’s October 29th. And I haven’t had a panic attack in exactly 7 days. Seems short to some, but that’s major to me, I am in a relationship (6 weeks) with someone who also suffers with anxiety. We help each other and it gets tricky at times, like making a decision on what to do, but we work through it and he is so supportive and I feel so lucky to have him in my life. 
My anxiety has been good, the panic attack last week was fear induced as I was in a situation that ended up with the police being called. But before that I hadn’t had a panic attack for 2 weeks. 
My depression is getting better, I still have days where I don’t wanna move and I just wanna sit there and cry but you gotta keep on pushing I suppose and everyday I find a reason to get out of bed, even if it’s just to go and sit downstairs infront of the tv all day. At least I’m not alone in my room. 
My eating disorder is the only one that’s really causing me issues, I am just not eating regularly enough, I don’t eat breakfast and I usually on have one meal a day and it’s not large portions. I say I forget, but I guess I kind of do, as it is always the last thing I think about as I don’t really get hungry and I’m going through a phase at the minute where I can eat so much then I start feeling really sick so I have to take a second, calm myself and carry on eating, I never vomit, I know it’s just in my head. It’s still hard to deal with sometimes tho.  

I suppose I wanted to come on here just to really say that things slowly get better but you have gotta have the strength to fight or find a reason to fight, mine is my siblings.

125,"Hi I'm writing here because after a tough year I'm finally ready to accept the situation that I am in and find a solution, I'm also hoping writing this will give me some kind of relief, for some background I am 20 and from the UK. Last year I came out of a pretty terrible relationship consisting of mental and physical abuse which lasted almost 4 years. I came out of the relationship with no social skills, no friends and absolutely no self esteem. The relationship is quite blurry and I don't really have much memory of that time, since then my mental state has deteriorated quite rapidly and it's beginning to scare me. Forgive me but it's hard to put this into words, I'll begin by describing a few of my symptoms which I think is severe GAD. I am extremely anxious all day every day, from the moment I wake up till the moment I go to sleep, of course it varies but even on a good day I'm still what I'd describe as extremely anxious, to give some perspective I'm often curled up on my bed truly overpowered by this feeling I have no choice but to submit to so I just grind my teeth, rip the skin off my fingers and wait for the storm to pass. I also experience unimaginable worry and dread related to almost everything and anything that goes on in my life. Things such as sitting down and watching some tv or sitting on my phone are a long forgotten luxury as sitting still is an impossibility.

I am also struggling with social anxiety however this seems to have diminished a little over the last couple months as my GAD has increased in severity, I've gone from only being able to socialy function around a handful of people to being able to make a couple of minutes of small talk in the office without visible perspiration. A small improvement but I'll take it as social anxiety still largely dictates my life. 

To add to this I have been experiencing bouts of depression, I'm not really sure on the severity so im hoping you guys could help with that. Basically I can't remember the last time I was emotionally happy, nothing is really pleasurable in my life anymore I just continue getting on with things because that's what you do. I don't experience any thoughts of self harm but I've no passion for life.

To try and combat this mental state I have significantly increased my exercise in the last year. I average 15k steps during the week and 20k on weekends combined with an intense 2 hour weight lifting session 6 days a week which manually puts the feel good stuff there but it's no replacement for a steady flow of serotonin.

I guess I'm writing this as I don't really know where to go from here, some advice would be nice, maybe someone could point my in the right direction. I know there are medical routes to take but I'm a little sceptical for a few reasons so if anyone could share their experience with medication that would also be appreciated.",29Oct2020,1

Hey.I (M24) struggle with anxiety for at least last 3 years. I did many bad things but Iam honestly regreting them and hate myself for them but I cant help myself. I cheated on my girlfriends, I was ling to them all the time, was on many dating apps even though I had loving girlfirend, I was sexting to complete strangers, I had sex with man, I watch porn all the time, Iam addict to it, I even watch gay porn but I dont like it. I feel like I cant keep myself from porn. I had gf for one year and half and we had sex even more times a day and still I was missing porn. I was abusive to her, not physically, never that. But I was lying to her every day and when she was suspecting something, I made her feel paranoid and guilty. I told myself tthat Iam not gonna sext anyone anymore but I could not keep myself from it and I lied to her so many times again. I left her to go to the doctor, because I made her feel like she is impossible and paranoid and hard to be ith. I really ruined her, but I really regret it. She is the best person I know. But I still couldnt keep myself from hurting her. I was breaking up with her aprox. 2 times a month. We would break up, she would cry and second day I would take it back and tell her I love her. I felt like I love her, but other times I felt like the relationship is bad and Iam unhappy and I dont wanna be with her. I always felt like it is gonna end anyway, I always feel like everything is just going to end bad. I have such a bad mood that I dont want to get up. It is impossible for me to finish my task for work or school. Iam so lost. I dont know what is wrong with me, I honestly wish I was different. Sometimes I think-maybe Iam gay, maybe Iam not strong enough to live with a woman and be a man, but when I remember my experience with man, Iam disgusted. I really dont like men. I dont know what to do. This post might be really mish mash, really messed up, but this is whats going on in my head. I hate myself, but I still kept hurting good people. Iam a very good liar. They always believed me and maybe sometimes I even made myself believe Iam not doing anything bad. I dont wanna be bad person. Iam going for therapies but it is hard for me to open totaly up and in this corona time we have only online session so it is even harder. Please help, if anyone has similiar exprience or anyone may know what is going on with me. I know I might have some disorder.

People say get into college get good grades get a job earn money you will be happy, how i am supposed to go into college when I can't even pass class 12th. Do you really think i have time of 5 plus years and I can survive this time span.

Here , i am barely surviving everyday. Neither I or my family has money to get myself treated, most people get depression because someone broke with them, like seriously? you people are so weak. get a life dude, if most of you or normal people get to live my life most of you had killed yourself few before even start of this year.

Sorry , I really wanted to get this off my chest, I feel dizzy when people claim that bro I can understand you feeling I am going through even worst. I am like seriously ? Many of you guys can get better health care than me, many of you guys have functional body, my bones are think like 12 year old boy while i am 18 with different types of health problems, see my last posts in which I asked people of reddit, that day many wonderful people helped me calm down , they even offered me money and gift cards, That was the week after many years when I slpt with a warm feeling of wanted. I felt great that day and week when people asked me about me. But also there were few assholes who said i am faking it and i want attention. liek yeah motherfucker If i wanted really some attention I would have gone for some other peopular subreddit.

I want to go out , but I can't cause these old clothes looks weird on my tall and thin body and my sleeper is stitched by cobbler. Not that I care about that but when I see strange people looking at me i get instant nauseous and anxiety.

you know what i do when i need to listen some binaural beats , yeah i dont listen songs actually haven't listened the in years. i use my earphone , a wired one from 2018 whose left earbud is broke and i have to stretch and tape it table to function, do any of you guys have to do it? naw, i am sure, think you want to listen something but only one earbud is functioning but only if you pressed down the cable or stick some tape to it over table.

internet is cheap here still , I had to wait 2 weeks to get internet connection, family said I don't need it. imagine you can't go out, you don't watch tv, you don't talk to anyone, you have a place to sleep in corner of one room , you don't have personal place, your door is always open, you can see everyone from your chair into house and vice versa, imagine all day you just lay down see ceiling fan . that was my life few days ago .

Imagine you are in 12th class and your life is depend upon it, while other are studying multiple hour everyday, you haven't touched the book in months, when you try it, you try to read something after few seconds our eyes are seeing your book while your mind is somewhere else, i have 2 parts maths physics chemistry, hindi and english, while physical is 1 part, but when you try to study anything by your sheer will power you see that your brain cant register or save anything, lol, timewasted.jpeg

you can't solve simple mathematics forget complex problems .

sorry i can't write anymore, this is not 5 percent of my problems. My family is dying, but constantly name calling me worthless made me lost respect for them, from years i am listening that they will throw me away if i get low grades in 12th, looks like they were right time has come but i won't let them throw mw away like a piss of shit i will sleep on train tracks before that time will come.

I don't know why i wrote this except that i just wanted to express myself . if you have read this than thankyou, if not than thankyou too, if you don't like this rant than downvote/report and fuck off.

thankyou",29Oct2020,1

140,"Hi friends. 

I'm a psychology major that's really passionate about changing the way mental healthcare functions. In particular, I believe that the fatal flaw of mental health is how medicalized its become, overlooking the importance of accessible preventative measures to maintain overall wellbeing. A particular measure is the role that non-professionals can play in mental health support.

I live in South Africa where the vast majority of the population lack access to any form of mental healthcare due to accessibility barriers such as cost, shortage of mental healthcare providers and national funding being distorted towards tertiary institutional mental health hospitals. 

As a result, I've been particularly interested in this sub as a way for people to share information about mental illness, challenge stigma and access social support. I was wondering to what extent you feel this space functions as a support outlet to you - either in conjunction with formal mental healthcare (your psychologists, therapists, psychiatrists) or as a form of mental healthcare in its own right. How has having access to this space impacted your mental wellbeing? And do you think online support spaces like these have a bigger role to play in mental health?",29Oct2020,1

I'm really worried about whether I should call in sick tomorrow because of how horrible I feel. But I have missed work everyday second week for the last two fortnights and have already been warned about taking too much time off work in September.

My mental health has been really bad this year and only recently have realised that I have bipolar 2 symptoms (previously diagnosed with depression and anxiety) but I haven't been able to see a psychologist since May because I wasn't comfortable with my new psychologist who I only saw twice. Unfortunately my first psychologist had to stop working at the place I saw her at to help with patient's due to Covid in April. 

Also I had really really bad burnout in October last year and made me stop having a normal shifts at work. Plus in late April to early July I was really suicidal and self harmed more than I had done in the past.

She wants to make it regular, and also go swimming every sunday but it is making sleeping and eating so difficult.

I have accepted it but it doesn't help. 

My second issue stems from the first, I have been fairly body conscious for 3 years now, I have a good body at the moment, worked hard and ate lots to achieve it, but my current inability to eat and sleep well is really dragging on my mind and I am worried about losing the hard gained weight, I feel like I am in deep water with a big rock in my stomach.

148,"Maybe you know some supplements that really helped you with fighting depression, negative thoughts, lethargy, anhedonia, lack of drive/motivation and being more social (talkative, open, funny).

I'm 21 years old and visit the gym 3-5x in a week. I don't drink alcohol, I don't smoke weed, I don't do drugs at all. I study psychology but because of depression I feel like I'm fucking dumb and unable to do anything. My cognition is so inhibited and thinking clearly or following/understanding topics is very hard for me. I feel down, innerly empty and so much ununderstandable pain all the time. I feel horrible about my past and my future and I have very low self esteem and think I'm worthless. I have difficulties to find things to talk about and being open with people. I have social anxiety and think too much in social situations (what does the other one think about me, he doesn't like me, he thinks I'm dumb, weird, worthless...). I can't even have access to my own knowledge, memories or thoughts. I feel so dumb and like I don't own a personality. Life feels like being punished in hell or living in a dead body most of the time.

I also abused phenibut (GABA-B-agonist) and am tapering off and withdrawing right now. Sure this plays a role in my actual depression that seems very severe right now. But before abusing phenibut I also suffered from severe depression and social anxiety. I don't know how much comes from the phenibut withdrawals and how much is my old depression. Just wanted to let you know if you can think about something that helps with GABA-B-agonists too.

I'm right now down on 2.5g of phenibut. Other things I use to support my mind/body and handle my depression:

* NAC (N-Acetyl-Cysteine) 3x600mg
* Agmatin Sulphate 2x1g
* Creatine 5g
* Beta Alanine 5g
* Vitamine Bs, C, D, K, Selen, Zincbisglycinate, Gingko
* Passionflower 2x750mg (5:1 extract)
* St Johns Wort 3x500mg (8:1 extract)
* OPC Grape Seed Extract 400mg

What I have at home and could add: Spirulina &amp; Mucuna Pruriens

1. What do you think about these supplements? Any of them being able to give me assistance and aid in my depression, cogntion, anxiety? Maybe also only parts of it like lethargy, lack of drive/motivation, negative thoughts and so on.
2. What are your experiences with supplements for depression or social anxiety? Anything you could suggest?
3. Are there any possible negative interactions between the supplements I take?

150,"Ever since I had to cut almost all of my friends out- my outlook for everything has sadly gone down, to the point I'm basically left with feeling sick from thinking about things that happened this year/things with friends that caused me to just cut everyone out, even thinking about any of it is enough to cause me to go insane for a short while. Even my remaining friends have told me that all of this has affected my emotional health in ways they never thought imaginable.  


But- the worst part about this? I've not only lost the ability to properly identify what are good and bad friendships, but I also can't take people's attitude seriously, let alone when they say things like (Everything is fine, it will get better, you will feel better in no time, time as a way of healing things, etc...) I understand that we have to put up a facade of happiness just to get by and show to others that we are fine, but the events that have happened in this year- both personal and around the world, has lead me to believe everyone is just putting on a fake mask just to get through the times.  


Not only that- but I'm also so burnt out on friendships by this point that I feel like cutting everybody else out and disappearing, but- of course, I can't allow myself to do that because I would be no better then some of the other people who only consider you as a friend until something happens and then they promptly stop helping you and essentially tell you in a way, ""Sorry dude- we understand you are going through some stuff right now, but we are going to cut you out and essentially forget about you until you feel better! Then you will have to come crawling back to us!""  


No- fuck that, my two previous friend groups knew I was going through a lot of shit, and their method of, ""Giving him space until he feels better and not check up on him,"" is fucking bollocks.

I am a new transfer student at a 4 year university. I graduated from a community college and got all of my gen eds. I'm majoring in forensics, because it always interested me. But I'm really struggling. I was taking chem and bio, but I withdrew from chem because I spent so much time studying to get bad grades and it was taking away from my other classes. Now that I can focus on my other classes, I'm struggling with bio. I failed the 1st exam because I didn't study as I was focused on chem. But I accepted it because I knew the reason why. But this exam I did study for, and while I did better than the 1st, I still failed. There are 4 required exams, and 1 optional cumulative final that replaces the lowest grade. The last day to withdraw is about 2 weeks from now, and the next exam is a few days after. I feel like if I do well on the last 2 exams, and do well on the final, I would pass. I honestly would be fine with a C. But I also feel like I could totally bomb the other exams too. I think I'm doing ok in lab, but lecture is killing me. And the lecture exams count for 75% of the final grade. It's only based on lecture and lab. There's no homework or extra credit.

I only debated withdrawing because I already withdrew from chem. I don't know how 2 withdrawals in 1 semester would look. And if I withdrew I'd be a part time student and lose my scholarship. It's not much, and fortunately my parents can afford college, and they say don't worry about the money, but it's nice to have a scholarship for a few thousand dollars. When I withdrew from chem, my advisor found another class to enroll me in to keep me full time. I also feel like I'd be annoying if I emailed my advisor again about bio.

I wasn't prepared for how hard these classes would be. Now I know forensics isn't the right major. I don't know what else I would do though. I do have other interests. I thought about taking time off, for that reason and mental health reasons, but I feel weird about going to a new school for 1 semester then leaving. I feel like everyone would think I'm giving up easily. The past month college has made me feel so bad. My mental health has never been like this. I've cried so many times to my parents. I've had anxiety, stress, and breakdowns nearly everyday. I don't want to fail. But at the same time I do feel like giving up. I feel so lost with my life. I usually watch YouTube or play video games to feel better, but even those aren't helping much. I don't know what to do at this point.",29Oct2020,1

She's been through some very hard times. Her mother is an alcoholic with a personality disorder. Her mother makes our lives difficult. One night 15 years she left our dog outside late at night, the dog wandered and got hit by a car and died. This slowly ate away at us, and my wife ended up in a deep depression, which led to inpatient treatment.

5 years later, a med change led to a spiral and she ended up in another inpatient treatment round and diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She pulled through, it took a lot of time, but we did it.

She has been great for the past 8 years, and I am so grateful.

We've overcome many struggles. I'm self employed, and through the years finances and health insurance have been major stresses. Through the years, health issues for myself, my wife, my son lead to some big challenges; emotionally and financially. A struggle to have a second child. But we pulled through. We're a great team. 3 years ago my brother was in the ER with a surprise heart attack which we attributed to weight and restaurant lifestyle (he was a manager). Come to find out, he had been a heavy drug user for 10 years. One year later he died.

My wife had a recent breast cancer scare. After two weeks, scans, and biopsies, we found there is nothing to be concerned about.

But last week, late one night, I kind of snapped and felt a rush of anxiety. I believe mounting stress is the cause. I'm often stressed. And I've been through the tougher bouts at this time of year, not often, but it's there occasionally. But then, during a late night not sleeping panic earlier this week, I felt a rush of regret, guilt, and fear because one memory came rushing back.

Back in junior year of college, there was a group of us (guys and girls) that all hung out together often, pretty much daily. We'd play cards, watch movies, play video games etc. I found myself sometimes hanging out over there and talking to one girl often. We'd listen to a few songs on a new album, shoot the shit, talk about school ... generally about a half hour of nothing really. We would give each other shoulder massages sometimes. But that was the extent of it. I never had romantic feelings for her. I loved my girlfriend (now wife) deeply. Still love her deeply. After a while though, I felt it was wrong and just stopped doing that. 

I haven't thought about it in 21 years ... but a few nights ago, it hit me like a tsunami of guilt and I'm in full bore panic. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I can't think. I can't work. I don't know how for 21 years I tucked that away as something stupid, immature, and naive to never have it surface again.

I know I'm a great husband, father, friend, son. I'm known as the guy with a big heart that would do anything for anyone. But this is haunting me. I just want it buried again. I can't tell my wife, not now anyway. She's a teacher and teaching right now is a tightrope walk as it is. I love her so much. I love our family. I'm in tears in my office. All for what I still think was just a stupid, immature, naive kid thing to do. But I do feel I betrayed my wife, and it's killing me.",29Oct2020,1
165,"I've spoken to my therapist about a lot of things. I don't want this account linked back to me so I won't name them all, but I do suffer from ongoing anxiety and depression. I haven't been clinically diagnosed but I've been suffering my entire life with these things and I know it won't just disappear.

169,"WARNING: long post ahead. 

I don’t know what to do and I don’t have people in my life to talk to. If you looked at me, you would never be able to tell. You might ask “what could I have going on?” Which is part of the reason I don’t feel comfortable talking to the people in my life. I’ve been asked that question when I tried to bring up the subject so I don’t.


Do you ever start to feel like this? I feel like a car that slowly running out of gas. 
Between my day job (9 to 5) and trying to get up early. 
Keep in mind, my body needs a certain amount of sleep. Or I don’t get up and I can’t function. I need to be getting up at five. Which means I should be going to bed by eight. That does not happen. If I’m lucky I’m in bed by 12. I can set 20 alarms &amp; if my body is too tired it won't wake up. I'm at a point where even when I do get '8 hours' I'm still exhausted. 
This is problematic because I have to be at work at nine and I've been going in early (8) on days when I meet with my PT. I meet with my PT (Personal Trainer) on Monday and Thur.

Background Info: F24
It takes me a minimum of three hours to get ready in the morning and at night. So, if I wanted to be in bed by 8:45 I would need to start getting ready at 5 PM and most days still at work at that time. Unless I leave early because of PT or stay later because certain things went unfinished. 
Also, I'm on a weight-loss journey. I lost 60 pounds by myself so I'm meeting with this PT to shed the last 40 pounds. Coronavirus has made things complicated health-wise. I had to focus on buying non-perishable foods. Eating the way I do, that's not practical. So, I started doing Hello Fresh, the plan I can afford is the $60 a week one which gives you 3 meals a week for 2 people. So that's what I do. But, it takes time to cook and my lunch break only lasts an hour. I don't meal prep because my meals come in on Tuesday and if I was going to meal prep it would need to be on the weekend.

I meet with my PT on Mondays and Thursdays. I  have off-day workouts on Wednesdays. Then, have to do cardio Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  Meetings with my PT are scheduled in so it's easier to manage. But the things like the cardio and off-day workouts are a tad harder. Depending on the weather and my workload I'll skip lunch to take a walk to get my cardio in. Sometimes I skip lunch in general because I have too much I need to finish. On days where I skip lunch, I rarely see my family. I don't see them a lot in general and I live with them.

 Most times if I’m lucky I leave work on time but other times I’m there till like six I should be getting out at five. If I’m out of work by six, and I hadn't eaten that day that means I finish cooking and eating my food by eight. If I go straight to bed after that I am in bed by 11. Sometimes it takes me a while to fall asleep so I’m not asleep until 1130 or 12. If I want to seriously talk to my family stretch that time a little bit. That’s my normal schedule. 

Now, in November, I’m going to be joining NaNoWriMo. I’m going to be writing a 50,000-word novel in a month. This means I need to dedicate at least 1 to 2 hours a day to writing... I wanted to do it earlier but that's not practical because I can't get up. That means I might not be going to bed until one or 2 AM. I want to be a published author which is one of the main reasons I'm doing this. But most published authors make nothing. Most of them can't quit their day job. I write because I love it and not for the money but I would love to live off of it. Being an author is all I ever wanted as a kid. But even if I did get published it would just be one more task on top of my 9-5.

Also, I don’t make enough from my job to live off of, but I'm too busy for a second job. I'm financially very responsible and I've been trying to secure my future. I've been working with a Financial Advisor.  So at least 20-30% if my paycheck goes to my financial future. If I didn't do that I still wouldn't have any money to live on my own. It would be something at least. 

 For the longest time, I neglected my looks and my appearance so I have been working on that. Hence the PT. But looking good and keeping up maintenance does not come cheap. That's part of the reason it takes me so long to get ready in the morning. One of the things that are keeping me from slipping into depression is the fact that I get dressed up every day. On some level looking good does make you feel good.  

On top of all that I am also trying to start a business. I am trying to build a future for myself. Outside of this daunting 9 to 5. I'm also learning French, and trying to maintain the few close relationships that I have. I’ve started a podcast as well which is going well. I started this around three months ago because I wanted to help people. I also think it's important to do things that bring you joy otherwise I think I'd drown. I love it but it is time-consuming.

 I don’t know how I do it. I feel like I’m running on empty. I don’t have anyone in my life that I can express this to. People assume that I'm not busy, or don't have anything going on. So they jump to conclusions. But people just don’t know. I try so hard, but sometimes I wanna break down and cry. But crying is emotionally draining and I don't want to deal with that. 

In situations like this, someone might say ""you're doing too much."" But what's the alternative? life doesn’t wait for anyone. If you don’t take the time to chase after the things you want the time may never come. I don't want to live the life I'm living. I want bigger things for myself. I'm realizing that comes with a price. 

There are times when I can vaguely recall waking up at 5 but my body is beyond exhausted I just can't drag my body out of bed.

I’m so tired all the time. But no one seems to care because working yourself to the bone is the norm in my family. Also, my job doesn’t stop during the weekends. There are so many other things I have to do on top of what I do during the week. I don't always have a choice. But what am I supposed to do? Quit? That's not an option especially not when trying to start a business. The hours are flexible but not a ton. So quitting doesn't seem realistic. 

But I’m tired of having to work myself to the bone to survive when I’m barely surviving. I will never make enough money to move out of my parent's house. But I also don’t have any other real opportunities. Everything I want to do with my life is things that are either not likely to live off of or it'll take time and luck. 

I want to be an author a published author. Most people will never be able to quit their day job to make a living off of being a writer. I also want to start my own business and make money off of that. But who knows how long it’ll take for that to kick-off? 
Do you see what I mean? I don’t know how I’m surviving and I’m afraid that one day It won't be enough. 


Looking at me you never be able to tell. I also don’t have a ton of close relationships in my town or state. Most of the people I’m close to the odyssey or out of the country.

I also have two dogs and out of all 3 people in my house, I'm the only one that takes care of them. I love them, but I feel guilty because I hardly get to see them. Simple things that would lighten my workload no one in my house will do. 

I’m tired. I’m tired of being tired. If I had one wish would be to sleep. I wanna rest. But I don’t see any way out of this and I’m not sure what to do. I’m trying to start this business. Hopefully, I can live off of it. But most businesses fails and it's not very realistic. Sometimes I just want to sleep and never wake up. I'm not going to do anything extreme, I'm just tired. I don't know what to do. Any advice?",29Oct2020,1

179,"Not sure whether to post this here or in a place like r/EngineeringStudents or r/College

And yet another incoherent mess of thoughts (like my other posts here)

I have a tendency towards negative emotions when it gets hard. Had some depression phases since i was 10, and they periodically come back. Other than that I mostly had it easy in life. Like even when everythings great and fine i can feel an ounce of depression or just down. You could say i am emotionally unstable? Not quite sure.
Now that uni started i almost feel like wanting to depart from this life again. 

I am not very social, i only talk in the big group chat of my engineering program but not much to individuals there. This is my first semester, been 7 weeks now, and due to fear of corona i have mostly worked from home despite the presence lecture offerings (which is also no more because of measures in my country). So finding friends and people to study with is extra hard. Doesn't help that i feel like a soon 19 year old baby at home, incompatible with these mature 20-22 year olds. Yesterday i tried a problem sheet that i absolutely couldn't do and had a frustration attack because of that. I haven't studied anything since yesterday even though i had a lot of time yesterday and i am already behind on a number of things and still have new things due. Time managment is a joke of course as well. Made me think about everything and how I already probably failed this semester.

Now that it got really hard, i haven't felt so bad in quite a while, no motivation, depressed, honestly i feel like someone please kill me (i wouldn't commit suicide). Just take me away from all this life, I'll gladly trade in all the rest next to the uni stress as well to not have to live and put up with this. Like i feel it will only get worse from here, I'll have to work and responsibilities and stuff, which I'll have to face still. It's all too much, just free me please. Also doesn't help that i don't know my own wishes desires or dreams. Did i want this degree? Will it get better? Will i even pass? It's not like i hate the degree or school, **i just automatically feel like dying whenever it gets even a bit hard with anything in life**. You can take this accented sentence about me out of context and it'll apply. It's so stupid, when facing even small problems i feel like that. And it's like a trap because i almost don't want to get help to improve, but sink in myself and be consumed by the problem, (it's almost comfortable) and take the easy way out. 

Also unrelated but it's annoying me so much that i never achieve to fully express my thoughts since they're all so disorganized. This is not everything i want to say and not well put.",29Oct2020,1

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non-invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires and six sessions of tDCS during three visits over one week. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS. All research procedures can be done from your own home--no in-person visits are required.

Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures.

*To make your personal research results not be identifiable with you if they are used for publication in the scientific literature and presentation at scientific meetings, we will remove all your identifying information, including name and date of birth.*

*Questionnaire answers and data collected during the task may be used in future studies, and if shared with other investigators, information that identifies the scan, questionnaire responses, or task data with you will be removed before hand. There is a potential risk of loss of confidentiality from such data sharing, but this is extremely low as only de-identified data from this study may be shared.*

*Clinical records, including your name and other personal identifying information, and research data will be kept in secure storage at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Information in paper format will be kept in locked files. Electronic data will be protected by a firewall (programming that makes it virtually impossible to access the data from outside the New York State Psychiatric Institute) and by restricting access within the New York State Psychiatric Institute through use of a password known only to authorized personnel. If information is transmitted electronically, it will be encrypted so that your identifying information remains confidential.*

*Records will be available to research staff, and to Federal, State, and Institutional regulatory personnel (who may review records as part of routine audits). Your information will also be available to other authorized individuals, including those at the New York State Psychiatric Institute.

So around 3 years ago a family moved in next door with an autistic son.  At first we just accepted the noise hey poor kids disabled.  But over 3 years our house has become a living hell.  From the moment he wakes up he's in his bedroom howling so loud you can hear him at the bottom of the street on and on and on and on.  Then hammering something loud and heavy against our shared wall over and over and over again.

This is not helped by the fact his parents argue and seem to just leave him there.  Occasionally you'll hear the mother shouting at the kid. Mother dosen't leave the house.  The only time the kid seems to leave is for school.  Loud parties and generally being hostile and anti social.

This has left me and my partner nervous wrecks.  Nobody seems remotely interested how stressed, depressed and on the verge of nervous breakdowns we are.

186,TW!! For years I’ve personally struggled with my mental health rarely telling people about it. I have always felt that my concerns were too dramatic and I’m just sad sometimes. But I’m sad all the time and when I’m not I’m numb. I feel that it is depression but I use that term loosely because I feel that because I haven’t been diagnosed it’s not appropriate to use. My friends who were diagnosed seem to feel that way too so I can rarely tell them about how I feel. I just feel like I’m being dramatic. But if I were just dramatic why do I just want to simply not exist anymore? Idk it’s something I’ve gone through for years. It feels like how I feel never feels valid unless I commit or get diagnosed. But I don’t want to hurt the people around me. That’s the only reason. I made my parents bring my pet bird to my apartment so I wouldn’t try something either. I honestly just want to feel happy and I hate feeling like I’m in constant pain and crying.

When I'm at my bf's we have healthy structured meals so I'm calm and happy but when I'm home alone and have to make my own choices I end up not making the best choices and it just weighs on me and makes me feel crap. 

I'm also finding it really really hard to keep my bedroom tidy. It feels like the mess is never ending everytime I clean it, it's messy again within hours. I just mean clothes, and other stuff. It's really hard to keep on top of and I hate going to my room after I come back from my boyfriend's. It's not a calm nice environment that makes me feel relaxed. I'm currently anxious because I need to catch up on work that I didn't do Monday- Wednesday but instead of just doing it I'll worry about it not being done?

Also I'm snapping at people and feel bad. My little sister asked for help with something and I snapped that I was busy and I never snap at her and now I feel guilty but it's like I resent anyone making any demands on me.

I got served my 4 week notice 2 weeks ago so I can't afford therapy but I also don't think I need therapy because what is there for me to complain about? It's not like I have an actual issue in life that can be resolved. Financially, I'm fine. I'm really good at saving so not too worried about job situation but I'm just not spending on ""extras"" like therapy or make up or whatever. 

I don't know exactly what I'm asking but just needed to write this somewhere. I'm struggling and can't pinpoint why.",29Oct2020,1

194,"I’m really not sure what to do. I struggle with a ton of different mental disorders that fight against one another (the worst being OCD with my DPDR) yet I can’t talk about it at all. It’s gotten to the point where I try to talk to my mom but she just gets up and leaves because I’m being silent. I wish people would be more patient with me. I know I can’t ask for much and I’m sure it’s frustrating for the other person but my mind works significantly slower than most and I’m really bad at talking in general.

It upsets me sometimes, and I know my friends have good intentions but it seems like whenever I open my mouth they laugh and say I’m funny. Like it’s not in a mean way at all, it’s just when I do talk I usually say weird stuff that doesn’t really make sense or I’ll say something that seems normal to me but anyone else would find it odd or amusing.

They take care of me really well, but I feel like because of my lack of voice and the fact that everything I say is taken in some type of humor way, I’m being ignored. I try and do anything to help the people around me but it seems like I can’t even speak without someone either leaving or laughing at me.

Usually when I confront people I write letters. It’s dumb but I have no other way of expressing my feelings without just writing (it’s my only strong suit academically). But I can’t just bring a letter wherever I go and expect them to just read it and understand everything. Especially at appointments, my mom talks so much and I feel like everything she says it wrong in some way but I never really speak up to correct it.

I just wish I could be like my other friends and express myself better. They often become upset or something happens that they talk to me about, but when I’m upset I don’t really blame them for pushing it off to the side when the only thing I can get out is “I can’t drive. I can’t read. I’m sorry.” I just wish it was easier and people would stop taking everything I say so lightly.

I want people to stop laughing at me. I’ve expressed that I’m hurt by it but because my lack of communication, they don’t really think I’m serious since I can’t do anything but make it lighthearted or comedic. Like I’ll say something along the lines of, “You guys always laugh at me. I do nothing and you guys laugh.” And they will go, “Oh my god no!! We aren’t laughing at you we are laughing with you!” And I’ll laugh because they all hug me and give me forehead kisses but I’m not laughing on the inside at all. I feel like a complete joke.

My friends are great people, completely amazing. Sure we have our issues and there is stress in the friend group at times, but I’ve never felt so loved and valid. (I was in a toxic friendship for 9+ years before them so any sort of affection I am so appreciative of). And they all struggle with mental illness so we understand one another and help each other out.

But with me it’s a bit different and I don’t think they realize how much this affects me. I downgrade my issues so people aren’t sad but expect them to understand that the jokes I make aren’t supposed to be funny, I just can’t speak unless it’s comedic or jumbled.

I wish I could speak up but because of my last friendship, I always feel like my feelings are minor and I shouldn’t complain as much. And maybe I’m over reacting- I’m positive I am because deep down I know they are doing their best to help me but god.. I feel loved but not so much understood.

I wish someone could go inside my head and just know what I’m thinking. Because I’m struggling so much right now and no one really gets the extent of it. Or maybe they do, but I’m just too slow in the head to realize. 

I feel like a comedic joke because nothing I say comes out as serious as I mean for it to, and if it does I just laugh it off and feel bad later.

Sorry, I just need to know if anyone is like this as well. So I’m not alone.",29Oct2020,1
195,"I have known these guys at University for just over a year now, and at this point in time, they're really the only friends I have, and with the current situation, it's a bit difficult to go out and try to make new friends.

Recently I've been beginning to notice that I'm only invited out for things when it's convenient for the group, like they never ask me if I want to do anything, or hang out with them, the only time it happens if say there's an event when they need 4-5 people and only 3 are available, then they only invite me along just so they can do it. They never initiate the conversation and I haven't actually spoken to some them in literal months

I still repeatedly ask if I can even be part of their group chat but they always ignore the question, refusing to answer it or they say they'll do it later but still nothing, so I have no idea what they're all up to. They just don't seem like they care, like they're only friends with me out of obligation

I'm also beginning to see that my friends only see me as the ""guy with the vr headset"" as that is literally the only thing I do with them, they don't invite me out for drinks, and in the next few days, they said they were going bowling but didn't even ask if I wanted to come along

I feel like I want to find new friends, but with the virus, it's very difficult, and I'm not the biggest fan of messaging online so I have no idea what to do

I would try to end things but because of university being the way it is, I'm living with one of these friends so I don't want things going sour in my own home.",29Oct2020,1
196,"So my (19 f) boyfriend (18 m) and I have been dating for 7 months now and everything has been fine except for my anxiety. I have really bad anxiety and I've had it my whole life (I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder at 7) . I was also recently diagnosed with BPD. Throughout these last 7 months I've been trying hard to get control over my anxious tendencies and overthinking constantly because the last thing I want is for my anxiety and mental health to affect my boyfriend. However there is one thing he does that will always trigger me no matter what and it's whenever he tells me ""we need to talk later"". For some reason when someone says this to me I start freaking out, wondering what I did wrong, crying and feeling like everything is falling apart. Even when my parents would do this to me as a child I would immediately start to worry because I knew I was in trouble. My boyfriend has done this to me several times in the past, he'll tell me we need to talk later, make me wait the whole day to hear what he wants to talk about (which makes me incredibly anxious enough) and then when he tells me what's wrong it's almost always something negative or something wrong. I've told him before that I would rather him tell me what's wrong in the moment or not bring it up until he's free because I can't stand waiting all day with crippling anxiety, wondering what I did wrong. Yesterday he did it again. I was on my way to an early morning interview for a job and right before I even park my car he texts me, ""nothing is wrong but we need to talk later"". I started crying and becoming severely anxious and even though he said nothing was wrong, I couldn't help but feel like there was because in the past when he's said that, there has been something wrong. Last night I told him again why I wish he wouldn't say that stuff to me and he said he tried to make it seem like nothing is wrong, but I tried explaining to him why it still triggers me because in the past there always has been something negative. At this point I feel like maybe it's my fault? But at the same time it's so hard for me to calm myself and tell myself things will be okay whenever someone says this to me...

TL;DR I get super anxious whenever my boyfriend says ""We need to talk later"" and he still does it even though I've told him why I can't stand it and at this point I feel like it's my fault.",29Oct2020,1

198,"Hello all. 

I looked up on Google where I go to get diagnosed but it keeps telling me to go to a therapist and talk out my issues. I’m not looking for a therapist to vent to (at least not any time soon), I am looking for a doctor who can diagnose me.

I’ve grown up knowing I’ve had issues with anxiety but these past few months I’m starting to become more self aware and I feel like there’s something more to it. I’ve had a rough childhood, my father took his own life when I was 11 and my mother was emotionally absent after that, simultaneously being psychologically abusive at times alongside her new husband.

I don’t like to diagnose myself and I know nobody can diagnose me officially through the internet. I just want closure and I want to understand myself better but I can’t do that if I’ve no idea why I do the things I do.

I’ve looked up symptoms for PTSD, attachment disorders, BPD since I heard it can be hereditary (my father had a very bad case of BPD).

I’m done looking up disorders and trying to figure out what’s going on, or if I’m just being a hypochondriac. But I know my behavior isn’t typical.

I’m in the United States. Would I actually have to see a therapist to get a diagnosis, or is there a different kind of doctor who can determine these things?

199,"I (M24) have been with my partner(F23) for 4 years. 3 out of the 4 years she has been suffering from OCD and we have been on and off the street. My partner has never had it easy. Being raised in the foster system to end up with a family who never loved her, dealing with rape and emotional trauma, caused her to develop mental health issues very early on. Depression, anxiety and OCD. When we met, she seemed to have things under control and was leading a happy life. 8 months into our relationship we both had things going on in our life that caused a lot of instability but we continued to stick together. We ended up moving in with my mother. My relationship with her was just being rebuilt due to her being a recovering addict. My partner and mother never got along. A few months in my partners OCD began to return and caused a lot of conflict in the house. We ended up leaving and living in my car. That is when her OCD worsened very quickly. I had no idea how to help her. I was always frustrated and resentful. Yelling and blowing up when she would need to act on compulsions. Which now that I realize, just made things worse. 

It’s been 3 years. I’ve gained more patience. But the OCD has just gotten worse. I’m not in contact with anyone I used to know. Neither is she. It is just her and I and the OCD. It has completely isolated us. I’m so unhappy and I know she is as well. I don’t feel like things will ever change. Not the way we are doing things. We don’t love each other like we used to. I want to help her get better but I don’t want to continue leaving like this and loosing years of my life. I’ve looked into treatment and specialists but she always says that it won’t work for her. The past week or so I think her compulsions have escalated into self harm. I don’t know for sure because I don’t see her unclothed anymore.

Although sometimes I don’t get how I am gullible and others aren’t. Like, that friend was teaching me some things in another language and at some point he went like “no, the word I just taught you is wrong” and laughed for a bit. He then said I shouldn’t believe everything everyone says. But how on earth am I supposed to know when to believe and when not? This is impossible.

Now I’m over here, crying because I feel silly for trusting everyone so easily and I kinda want to fall asleep and never wake up.

The past year has been very very rough for me and I’ve been having these issues:

So I’ve been having a lot of bad days lately. I wake up automatically in a bad mood most days. I sometimes treat my parents rudely for no reason but I cant stop it.

I would be incredibly awkward and do shit like force laughter at something in a movie/ad/show that I didn't really find funny but thought other kids would find funny, but it all did was weird out or annoy the other kids around me.

As an adult, I often find myself just putting on the most bland milquetoast persona for strangers because I don't really know what's going to offend or weird them out. It's not like I really care if other people like me or not, I just don't want to be harmed for saying the wrong thing. I used to get physically abused a lot by my mother if I said something to piss her off, so maybe it's thanks to that, I dunno. I have been stalked and/or verbally abused by a few in my teenage/adult years though for saying the wrong thing, or even just saying nothing at all is enough to piss some people off I've found.

I also have a habit of just replying with random shit like ""yeah"" when someone says something and I have no idea what they just said, but I'm too pussy to ask them to repeat themselves (or I did, but I don't understand the second time either and no way in hell am I gonna ask them again unless I know it's something seriously important).

It's all even made worse that I'm now homeschooled and I can't get work done since I couldn't get myself to do it.

After years of wondering what's wrong with me I checked if I could have ADHD considering my brother has it too and lo and behold, I actually do. For most of my life I've been showing symptoms of it and I tick all the boxes. My next step is to seek a professional to assess me with a better eyes then go on from there, but I can't do that.

My parents don't actually believe (or severely misunderstand) in the existence and threat of mental problems like ADHD and many others (including depression). So it's hard for me to get support for my condition. Seeing how they treat my brother who is actually diagnosed with it I know that it's pointless for me to try and ask help from them. I don't have anyone else to ask help from either.

I'm stuck at the mercy of my parents who won't offer me the support I need such as seeking professional help and such and just think I'm a lazy bum and everytime I present reasons and explanations behind my difficulties they just scold me for making excuses and /or complaints. Then if I don't get my act up together then they'll kick me out. Btw, I'm still a minor and am still a year away from my 18th and even then I still wouldn't know what to do with myself.

I had a relapse in this behavior after coming to terms with a bad breakup. I started feeling intensely ashamed, and that was when I started acting up again. A reddit post led me to the idea that I may have borderline personality disorder (BPD). I brought this up with my therapist &amp; lo and behold, after some denial etc., I started acting toxic/crazy with her. And she said she recognizes this as borderline &amp; she's changing the way she therapies me (no more giving me pity since I feed on it). She won't write it on my chart, but she believes I have traits of the disorder. 

Its crazy, the more I think about it, the more ""borderline"" I feel. And I remember that there were periods in my life when it took me so long to fight the shame, and it worsened as I felt ashamed for feeling ashamed. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy. And I think its happening again.

Now I'm so ashamed in myself for letting this resurface. Heck, I'm ashamed its their at all. When a close person ""discovers"" this about me, it makes me not feel the same. I feel ashamed to even relax or play or give myself good things. After my therapist basically confronted me, it felt like my relationship with my sister all over again: My relationship with her crumbled once she addressed my behavior. 

Does anyone have advice on how I can go about my life? My world feels changed. I'm sucked back into that feeling where I just can't shake that I deserve nothing. What would a ""normal""/healthy person think like if they did something wrong? How can I remorse what I've done without revoking my care for myself?

I feel so dark inside, I just feel like crying &amp; wanting someone to give me pity and tell me that I did nothing wrong and its ok. But that isn't true, I am responsible for my actions. Its hard for me to cuddle with my giant, fluffy pillows and feel relaxed. Its hard for me to feel excited and play games. Its hard for me to reminisce about the good times with my ex. These are ""feel good"" things I usually do, that I now refuse to do because I feel like I don't deserve them.

Yet, I ""know"" now that I cannot possibly be this person -- that I am a sick and twisted individual. I should honestly accept myself for both, because I **am both**. People love me for the things I do well, and distance from me when I act poorly. But I'm unable to love myself anymore. 

TL;DR: As per usual, after someone ""discovers"" my inner toxicity, I feel uncomfortable and want to pretend it never happened. After a relapse of my bad behaviors and being confronted by my therapist, I was diagnosed with traits of Borderline Personality Disorder. After being confronted and diagnosed, I feel extreme shame and won't allow myself to participate in my daily ""feel good"" activities, nor can I convince myself that I am the good person that people on the outside see me as without acknowledging that I have bad sides too.",29Oct2020,1
220,"Hey there, it's been a while but sometimes I experience like a sudden change in my consciousness. It suddenly feels like I am in a dream. It's hard to explain but it does feel very uncomfortable. It feels like I am in a videogame with no emotions and everything feels less real. I just wanna know is it normal or is something wrong with me. Am I overthinking. I am really concerned.",29Oct2020,1
221,"I'm a m18. As said in the title.  I hate my body. So many aspects of it. Mostly ones that are typical for guys to hate about themselves but also just stupid stuff like my feet size or the shape of my nose. The thing is I know that my body overall would be conventionally labeled as ""okay"" but I just can't stop thinking about everything I hate about it.

I have this weird thing where I literally go from a douche with a god complex to banging my head against the table and screaming about what a stupid idiot I am because of something I did or just something about myself in general. I'm really starting to think I might be bipolar or something like that.

I have also been been very depressed ever since I was around 14. I don't know why. My brain just doesn't give me the happy. Nothing is fun. No energy. Waves of sadness. I had a hormonal deficiency but I had surgery for that and I was hopeful that it would at least partially fix me but it doesn't. Some other reasons are that I often just feel alone or not important and unloved by anyone around me. This has several times brought me to the verge of commiting suicide. I travel to school every single day by train and the amount of times I thought about just making a step forward while it isn't completely in the station yet.

I told my mum about the depression recently and all she did is suggest I find a new hobby and that I should go outside more. I don't know  what more to do. I just want to be happy.",29Oct2020,1

224,"My bf is a really lovely guy who had moved abroad in October. He was definitely having a great time after the move, he had a buzzing social life and when I video called him he was often smiling and laughing, despite his high PhD workload. He also organised trips for us to meet up every couple of months. 

Now he has moved back to his parents' house after the lockdown in March. I could be wrong but I believe his parents are emotionally abusive, especially his mother, who was angry that he moved and wanted him to move back to their town instead. She will criticise my boyfriend saying stuff like he can't think for himself etc. But he has a weird dynamic with her, in which it seems he dislikes her (although he would never say that) but also wants to please her. She pressures him to spend time with her and she seems to think she should be the main person in his life.

Anyway, since he has moved back he seems to have slowly become a shadow of himself and talks about pressure from all directions, and has a permanent frown. This is coupled with his research not having gone well and a total lack of social life for the entire pandemic. 

But when I ask him to come and stay with me (I live with my brother and a friend), he refuses saying he cannot focus at my house. Could this be a symptom of depression/anxiety? I'm really thinking that his mental health will be given a boost if he moves here for a while and can see friends (I live near the city we went to university at). But he won't take this opportunity, perhaps because of his parents' negative reaction.

I don't know what to do.",29Oct2020,1

226,"I have had multiple psychiatrists blame my parents but I've always refused to believe this and discounted it.

I'm a 36 year old gay male currently staying with my parents during the pandemic as I lost my job, my mother lost her job too so thought the rent may help them; i have savings and rental income from a house I own  so don't really need to stay here but they are broke so have been paying them rent as well as fixing all of the issues they need fixing around the house   which have been a lot. I've probably spent £5000 on fixing issues as well as the £3000 ish I've paid in rent since march. 

I have bipolar disorder and my mood is more and more stable as the years go by I was diagnosed 7 or 8 years ago and have mostly stabalised it. 

Now that I am staying with them I see all of the dysfunction in our interaction, I've slotted back into the way of arguing that was normalised growing up ( moved to various cities and countries since age 19)  they're racist, xenophobic, prejudiced against LGBTQ people but mostly stay silent against gay men apart from the odd comment against camp gay men as I'm not camp so I guess they assume it is ok. I never argue with anyone the way I do them.

I'm starting to realise they fucked me up combined with genetics and environmental factors etc I know it isn't solely down to them.

At what point to you stop blaming your parents ? I know it is a cliche to blame your parents for your mental health but that is always something I refused to believe when I have been told multiple times by psychiatrists. 

I'm only recently starting to believe they played a role now that I'm staying with them... I'll be moving out in 3 weeks to start a new job in a different city but I don't think I will ever move back here again.

So now that you have heard about my sudden realisation I wondered what you feel about how your upbringing impacted the way you go about life and if you think it's have negatively impacted your mental health? 

I will add my brother was a drug addict who died and my sister has mental health issues also and also harbours negative feelings towards our parents for the same reasons.",29Oct2020,1
227,"My fiance has given me the choice to rehome our 7 month old puppy because of my mental health issues and to help relieve the constant stress I've been under this year. Let me give you some background.
I already know I'm a terrible person for even considering this but me (20f) and my fiancee (19m) have been together for a little over 2 years. About 7 months, April, ago he had suddenly passed out in front of me which has resulted in multiple urgent care visits, test, and medications. He was later diagnosed, that same month, with epididymitis. After his diagnosis he began having very bad vision issues and eye issues (idk how else to explain it). After a few more visits to urgent care we were sent to an optometrist in fear that if nothing was wrong with his eyes he could potentially have something wrong with his brain. In August the doctors assumed it could be an unruptured aneurysm. Now September rolls around and come to find out he has 30/20 vision or 40/20 vision and he just needs glasses. After he got his glasses the eye problems went away but he still has pain every now and then from the epididymitis. 
Around may is when we got a 4 week old cattle dog/Shepard mix. He's had a lot of problems with him too. We mainly got him as a comfort dog for my fiance as he was going through a lot both mentally and physically. At first we were able to manage with him, me doing most of the work as my fiance was on medication that made him dizzy and not feel good over all. As the months went on we notice that our dog kept peeing everywhere as if he couldn't control his bladder, we also notice that a lot of homeless/drug addicts are throwing garbage in our yard where he used to spend a lot of time. (Side note we live next to a street that is frequently used by the homeless/drug addicts, there's a homeless park 2 streets down and someone in our neighborhoodsells drugs to them and that house is 5 houses down from ours) September we took him to the vet to find out that he needed several test done to him to find out whats wrong with him. The vet said our dog has admoralites in the kidneys which is very odd for a puppy. Our guess was it could be all the stuff the homeless/addicts have been throwing in our yard. We came to this conclusion because our front fence is facing the street, I have witnessed a homeless man come out from behind my garage at 5am in the morning, our fence has been cut and tampered with several times, people stole our ""covid please do not pet the puppy as someone in the household is immunocompromised"", and someone stole our pooper scooper right off our porch.
Around August I had attempted suicide (I have a long history of manic depression/anxiety, disassociation disorder, and now hinds of BPD) not only do I have things going on with my fiance and dog but as well as outside my own life and into my families lives ex. My dad got into a car accident, my grandmother and best friend are experiencing depression for the first time and are asking me for coping mechanism, I exiled my sister from my life for constantly putting me in uncomfortable situations as well as keeping my stuff when she moved back into my old high school room, and I had an abortion in March. Soooo things haven't been great and I've been losing myself every single month. I have nothing but suicidal thoughts as well as self harm tendencies on my mind and I have no motivation to do anything. 
Tuesday afternoon I got a wild spark of motivation to clean our bathroom and bedroom. I had so much motivation I even rearrange our bedroom to give our puppy more room, as he is still growing. I was extremely proud of myself because I used to clean my entire house weekly but now it's more even 2 months. I cannot tell you how proud I felt and how accomplished I felt. The next day, Wednesday, we go to my moms so I can do laundry (we don't have a washer or dryer at our house). We stay there for about 7 hours and our dog is usually super good on his own but when we got back the bedroom had been completely trashed.
This sent me spirling into a mental breakdown and to dissociate. I began crying uncontrollable and I started hitting my head really hard, I clawed at my scalp, punch my legs until they bruised, and pulled out some of my hair.  I lose hope for the rest of the year, I want/have plans to k*ll myself by the end of the year because I feel like it never well, and I am completely at my wits end. I feel like giving up and there's no hope for the world or for my life to be good.
All in all this year has chewed me up and spit me our several times. I feel as if rehoming our dog would be good not only for me but for him as we have a 1br, 1bth, and he's not allowed in the yard anymore. I think its be good for me but I worry because even through it might help me my fiance loves that dog to death and you can't just take that away from someone. I love my fiance so much and even though I take care of the dog the most I feel major conflict in my heart and head. I don't know what to do and I just need someone else's advice. 

Also I'm sorry if this is vague or if the times don't make since. As I mentioned I have mental health issues and to be completely honest this year just blended all together and time doesn't feel real anymore.",29Oct2020,1
228,"

Need to change my therapist 
Super unprofessional and condescending 
Had a phone call visit with her and I was reminded why I don’t want to meet with her again . 
She asked me what happened to the job me and my husband were working at and after I told her we got laid off because of COVID she just said “Oh” in a tone of disgust.

Then proceeded to ask me how we survive? With bills? 

Why is she asking me about my income and money and savings and job when I wasn’t even mentioning that at all to you. That is very personal information. I shouldn’t have to disclose with her how much money my family has and how we are surviving. I’m not asking her for any money. She’s not a bank. 

The only reason I met with her was because I met with the psychiatrist at the same facility she works at and I guess they notified her. 
I’m sure she has access to the prescription they prescribed me but she still went ahead
And began to say in a very patronizing way 
“So what medication did you say you were on? “
I said “Wellbutrin.”
“Oh yeah my cousin was on that medication they gave her 5 mg. How much did they give you? “
Wtf!!????
Does she not have access to my chart? 
I said 150mg 
And she says 
“Damn! That’s a lott!!! What was going on with you???”

It’s very common for people to be prescribed 150mg of bupropion. 
She should know these things.

I have anxiety and depression and the pandemic has affected me.
Another dissatisfied “oh”.

Then I told her my son had a fever and I had given him Tylenol and it got better
she said “ if it comes back take him to the emergency room”
This obvious advice. I’m a good mother and I hate when people question my intelligence as a parent. 
She gives me no valuable insight or coping mechanisms she just asks questions like a bad publicist looking for information to go gossip about with her cousins and friends about her “patients” 

I was then understandably annoyed and was “short” with her according to her. 
The visit was over the phone and I could clearly sense I was on speaker I had no idea who or what was listening to me but that violates patient confidentiality.
So I was not in a talking mood and she said we should speak another time, and I said ok. Never did I yell at her or disrespect her.
Then she text me again and ask me if I’m okay and I say 
Yes.
And then she CALLS AGAIN and asks me if I’m okay and that she’s doing a wellness check because I don’t seem like myself? 
Wtf??? 
Who wants to speak to an unprofessional therapist???? 
Am I being the asshole?",29Oct2020,1
229,"I have no idea how to cry and let out emotion

Sorry if this isn’t the kind of post People generally post on this sub, it’s my first time on here

Im a sophomore in high school (15 M) and I’ve recently been really wound up and I really can’t take it anymore. I have no idea how to let out emotion, I haven’t cried since way before my great grandfather who served in WWII died maybe half a year ago. Plus, i met someone I liked and we have a good relationship which I won’t go too far into here but I’m overwhelmed with emotion and have no idea how to handle it. I’ve been really wound up and almost angry recently, I always have anxiety so me being super anxious isn’t weird, and I just want to cry. Sometimes I feel like absolute shit and I really feel the want to and I try to but I just can’t, my body and mind just shove it all down inside and there’s absolutely nothing I can do about it. I’ve been talking with several people and they all say I should get help and get therapy and see someone but my fear of judgement from even asking my mother or father to get me therapy stops me in my tracks, honestly my fear of judgement stops me from doing a lot of things and telling my mother and father what I truly think about them. Long story short they’re divorced, my mother manipulates me, my father does too they both do a ton of weird shit, my father was never around when I was little and my mother hasn’t ever taught me anything to the point that I’ve had to watch porn and I didn’t know what deodorant was a few days ago, and I don’t even admit to friends (even ones who watch porn and are open about it) that I do because of fear of judgement and how I was raised and I just can’t talk about emotion or anything with anyone and never have. I’ve spent the last while looking up how to cry because I really can’t take it anymore and I’ve been trying but it’s like banging my head on a brick wall. I’ve wanted to kill myself in the past and kinda have lately but am nowhere near that, idk To be honest lately I’ve been a mental train wreck, feel bad about a lot of things, and I don’t know I’m not getting therapy just yet for a number of reasons but I don’t know if there’s someone out there who knows what I should do differently or Idk Im probably being a dumbass and acting like a child and not getting help because I’m a pos and an idiot, even though I have straight A’s. Who cares.
Thanks for listening to my rant or whatever you could call this idk tbh, if Im being a little bitch and should just get therapy tell me. Idk up to you. Thanks.

I just realized this is probably a mess to most people so-
Idk what should I do is what I’m asking ig.

**What is shame?** The painful feeling of humiliation or distress that comes from the sense of being or doing a dishonorable, ridiculous, or immodest thing; the feeling that you are *less than*, unbefitting, or undesirable. 

**What causes shame of a mental dysfunction.** History, culture, the disease model of mental healthcare, and mental health stigma (MHS).

**Why you should not be ashamed**. History is crude and inconsistent, culture is misinformed, the disease model is exploitive and archaic, and MHS is generated and sustained by prejudice, ignorance, and discrimination based on disinformation.

**What is shame? Carl Goldberg described shame as** ""feeling ridiculous, embarrassed, humiliated, chagrined, mortified, shy, reticent, painfully self-conscious, inferior, and inadequate."" There are many aspects and degrees of shame; volumes have been written about shame's types and complexities. Here is what some of the experts write. Shame is painful,  incapacitating, and uncontrollable. Shame makes you feel powerless, inferior, acutely diminished and worthless. 

Shame makes you want to escape, to become invisible. It elicits self-defensive reactions that can make you feel inadequate or become hostile and aggressive. Shame is unavoidable and  impacts every aspect of the human experience.

Shame is not all bad. Shame alerts you to wrongness. You have done something wrong (you are bad), someone has wronged you (they are bad), or you feel wrong (you are inadequate). Shame can be revealing, cathartic and motivational, promoting change, growth, and broadened self-awareness. 

Right now, I am only concerned about the shame you feel because of your mental dysfunction. Everyone has some degree of psychological disturbance. It is a universal and undiscriminating condition; it infects during childhood rendering you unaccountable. So why do you feel shame? Because mental illness is historically denigrating and culturally feared and scorned – beliefs perpetuated by the disease model of mental health and reinforced by MHS claims that you are disgusting, distressing, frightening, and undesirable. 

The disease model of mental health focuses on what is wrong with you. It labels you by your diagnosis, and you cease to be a person. You are then lumped in with others similarly diagnosed and labeled as schizophrenics, paranoiacs, depressive persons, persons with anxiety. You are then stereotyped by the most descriptive symptoms and characteristics of your dysfunction using terms utilized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (e.g., *incapable, deceitful, unempathetic, manipulative, irresponsible).* Then and ignorant (*misinformed*) and prejudiced (*fearful*) society stigmatizes or brands you as personifications of that stereotype.

Labels, stereotypes, and stigma are inaccurate representations because of the ""implied expectations of how people with mental health problems *may* behave."" [\[ix\]](https://www.reddit.com/submit#_edn9) You may share or resemble symptoms or characteristics of a dysfunction (who doesn't), but the sum of the label and stereotype is not the sum of the person. You are not your dysfunction.

**Mental Health Stigma** is the hostile expression of the abject undesirability of a human being who has a mental illness. Stereotypes label the mentally dysfunctional  unpredictable and dangerous. (Ironically, the early asylums in Spain and Egypt were built to *protect* the mentally ill from the dangerous and violent members of society.) The stigma or branding does not need to be true or accurate; it just has to be believed. Its only purpose is to separate you from the rest of society, which pretends they are normal, and you are not. 

**What are the factors or attributes in MHS?** Mental health stigma is formed facilitated by ignorance (misinformation), prejudice (fear), and discrimination (false superiority). Stigma supports and is supported by public opinion, media misrepresentation, the mental healthcare industry, and the disease model of mental health. 

First of all, studies show that the aversion to mental illness is socially hard-wired. Society considers you dangerous, unpredictable, and socially undesirable. Society wants to distance themselves and isolate you because of their deep-rooted fear and realization of their own susceptibility. 

The media stereotypes anyone with a dysfunction as an unpredictable, hysterical, and dangerous schizophrenic. Half of news stories on 'mental' illness allude to violence. A person with a mental illness is either a homicidal maniac, autistic, or a rebellious, hair-brained, free spirit. 

Healthcare professionals are often undertrained and inflexible**.** You know how your disorder impacts your emotional wellbeing and quality of life far better than your doctor. Clinicians deal with 31 similar and comorbid disorders, over 400 schools of psychotherapy, multiple treatment programs, and an ever-increasing plethora of medications. 

The mental healthcare community is drowning in pessimism. There is evidence to indicate the problem is endemic in the medical health community and universally systemic, which means that it impacts you personally, and the current model of healthcare is the culprit. 

Clients report instances where staff members are rude or dismissive. Complaints include coercive measures, excessive wait-times, paternalistic or demeaning attitudes, one-size-fits-all treatment programs, medications with undesirable side-effects, and stigmatizing language. 

The 'defective' or disease emphasis has been the overriding psychiatric perspective for over a century. By the 1952 publication of the first DSM, the focus had drifted from pathology (the science of the causes and effects of your dysfunction) to pathography (the breakdown of your psychological shortfalls, categorizing them to facilitate diagnosis). Pathography focuses on a deficit, disease model of human behavior. Which disorder poses the most threat? What behaviors contribute to the disorder? Are you contagious? What sort of person has a mental illness? It is these attributions that form public opinion, stigma, and your self-beliefs and image. 

The disease model and the DSM's diagnostic system is under increasing scrutiny for its misdiagnosis, constant criteria revisions, symptom comorbidity, one-size-fits-all recovery programs, and general negativity. The Wellness Model of mental health focuses on your character strengths and virtues that generate the motivation, persistence, and perseverance to recover. A battle is not won by focusing on incompetence and weakness; it is won by knowing and utilizing your strengths and attributes. That is how you recover―with pride and self-reliance and determination―with the awareness of what you are capable. 

**Why you should not be ashamed** 

(*History is crude and inconsistent, culture is misinformed, the disease model is exploitive and archaic, and MHS is generated and sustained by prejudice, ignorance, and discrimination based on disinformation*.)

Recognizing that shame is a fundamental part of human nature allows you to confront it and realize, while others may try to shame you, it is up to you whether you chose to be shamed. it is purely self-motivated. No one can make you feel shame; it is entirely of your own volition. Others may attempt to shame you, but it is up to you whether you chose to be shamed. What is there to be ashamed of? Mental illness is universal and undiscriminating. Everyone is dysfunctional in one way or another. You are not responsible for being infected. You did not deal yourself the cards. You should only feel shame if your disorder negatively impacts your emotional wellbeing and quality of life, and you refuse to do something about it.",29Oct2020,1

I just started driving this week, I passed my first three drives and we started drive four which is off campus and into town. Playing nice with other drivers that fun stuff.
I cannot stop disassociating when I'm driving. I kept failing to notice things like where I needed to turn when backing up and ended up off the pavement, not turning fast enough or turning too fast, not breaking soon enough, not turning in that four to five second grace period. Just zoning out all together still driving the car and rambling off what my driver's ed teacher wanted to hear and doing okay on the back roads to campus, I wasn't speeding and I was between the lines. I just can't stop disassociating and I'm stressed while driving because I was in a crash in 2017 and should have died, my airbag and seatbelt didn't deploy when they should have and I shattered the windshield with my head but am still alive with probably some worse migraines I don't know I didn't have insurance to get looked at then.
It's probably related to the fact I'm scared shitless to get in a crash but at least it's better? I use to disassociate a lot worse nine months ago, I'd be gone for days instead of just one or two hours. I'm going to talk to my therapist about me disassociating so much when I see her next week.

Whenever I close my eyes all I can see is a blackness, there is nothing inside me, no feelings, no thoughts, nothing, just emptiness. I can't cry, I cant laugh, I don't enjoy anything but I am not even able to feel guilt. In the last months I wasn't even able to feel anxiety.

Whenever when I recognize even a trace of some feeling it goes away within minutes. The only emotion I have been able to feel is anger. And I'm so fucking scared that might hurt someone.

Personal data collection. For me, I am bipolar and have adhd so my psych variables change a lot, tough to get objective insight. Could help get clearer objective picture. Memory is extremely fallible.

Research. Could crowdsource data (people who use it could opt in or out) to analyze relationship between variables in a very ecological way. Or could be used in general psychological research.",29Oct2020,1
240,"I don’t really know what to write about so I’m just going to go over some things and dump my emotions a bit. 

For years now, I’ve sort of felt like I had some issues with being social and making friends, and even now that I’m older and have identified what seems to happen (friends that actually dislike me, friendships that always end with arguments that I usually don’t initiate, quickly growing apart very suddenly, etc.), but I don’t really know how to handle it because at this point I feel like the best solution for myself would be to learn to not get emotionally attached to most people I meet/know because it feels like every friendship quickly has its inevitable doom with me. 

Over my life, I think I’ve made only two friends I can really think of that I was friends with for more than five years. Both of them live in different continents than me and I haven’t seen either of them for over a year. One of them I have a bit of a language barrier with which makes it hard to write to them, and I have some other but sort of similar barriers with the other one sometimes that I won’t really get into because I don’t want to assume or share anything since it’s private. 

Overall, I don’t think I’m a bad person, but in some ways I do doubt myself in that regard. I’ve gotten told by my friends and family that I’m rude or mean when all I think I’m doing is being blunt and straightforward. I often feel anxious or paranoid and like I overthink things. A lot of the times these friendships have ended I always feel like I’m the one to go within the group, even when I was the one who introduced the others to each other. I’ve always been told I’m super mature, and I really care about school and do pretty well in it, but despite this I feel like I miss social queues often and later realize what was wrong.


Despite this, I analyze almost everything I can find, whether it be art, writing, politics, or whatever, but even with my supposed maturity I can’t seem to connect with people in this way. Going back to whether or not I’m a bad person, maybe I have a good set of morals but I still am?? I don’t really know. I think my bluntness may have come after I was lied to a lot and most people I knew were never straightforward with me so I couldn’t fix my behavior before they abruptly get pissed at me. 

I have weird dreams a lot, and they usually fall under two categories, ones where I die at the end, both peacefully and horrifyingly, or ones where I have a total meltdown in front of my classmates and embarrass myself to hell. 

Thanks for reading my vent, I would appreciate any tips or advice anyone may have. I don’t think I’m alone in this, yet I still can’t find any long term friends who I can be around.",29Oct2020,1
241,"Trigger warning, I guess.

Ever since I came home from school I’ve been wasting time, waiting for my friends to come online and play video games with me. Only to get messaged that they won’t come today. I’ve been learned a little for my exam tomorrow, but I couldn’t concentrate at all. I was so sad for some reason when they said they wouldn’t come, especially because I have a crush on one of them. I miss talking to him, although it’s been yesterday that we last talked. 

I’m so eternally stressed because in one month I will get a reply from the office of my dream job. I applied for that job in January. It was such a long way to go since then, and I only have to wait another month. It’s killing me inside by now. It stresses me to the point that I’d rather commit suicide than find out if they’d take me or not. A few days ago a letter from them arrived and my mum showed me, and I almost had to throw up, until it turned out that it was only because of something else. I can’t do this. This is literally going to decide my whole future. It’s too much. I’d rather leave right now. I honestly don’t know how I’d react if they rejected me. That would be so terrible, but since there are 700 other people who applied for that job, it’s likely going to happen. I really can’t take this anymore.",29Oct2020,1

245,"I (21F) live in the Midwest in the USA. One of my friends (20F) has been having suicidal ideation for a while now that has gotten progressively worse and worse over the past month or so. Her family instilled in her many harmful things and she basically doesn’t believe in therapy and WILL NOT open up to professionals even when people she trusts are there with her. She thinks all professionals are trying to do is “get in her head” and will only open up to two people, which has led to those two people to suffer in their own mental health because they aren’t equipped to counsel her through all of her trauma. 
We have all done our best to be there for her, give advise, and love her all we can, but it isn’t enough to get her through her struggles and we all know that. 
There have been multiple nights where she has alluded to commuting suicide and a few people will rush over in a panic and find her alive. She always says we overreacted and will shut down if we press her on anything regarding her mental health. Her family is across the country and we don’t know how helpful they would be and we have been struggling to find her dads contact info. We feel our only option the next time she has an incident is to call the police. The last time we were over there she said she was planning on drowning herself cause she has looked up “the least painful ways to die” and it was next to guns, she says she cannot get a gun so it was her next best option. She has also talked about possibly taking pills. When she opened the door she was in a towel and said she was “just showering to calm down” and that what she said was a “joke” but I don’t buy that and I worry what she might had done had we not nearly broke her door down with our knocking. I feel so lost, we have gone to our university, our university health center, and the counseling center, but they have all basically said “we can’t force her to do anything and she lives off campus, next time call the police”. There are no in person counselors because of the pandemic and my friend will not meet with one virtually. She doesn’t want help, she thinks she’s fine, but she has been self harming by scratching herself and we had to restrain her for an hour so the last time before she finally calmed down. We would have called the police had her friends not been on their way to pick her up and “watch her” for the weekend. I’m glad they got her out of her apartment, but I know this won’t be the last issue and I feel horrible about everything cause I feel like I should have handled it better.
We all know next time we need to just call the police, everyone we talk to just says “call the police” and I know that’s what we should and will do. But I’m scared about what happens AFTER we call the police. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What happens when you call? Do you call 911 or non-emergency? When is it bad enough to call them? I just worry that if she says “I’m fine” and they leave her at home she will never open up to us again and will just isolate until something horrible happens. I guess what I’m asking is: what happens once the police are called? How do they determine if she needs to go somewhere or not? Does she need to be actively trying to harm herself for us to call? 

All of us are in our early 20s and we are just so lost and worried sick about her, any advise would be helpful.

TLDR: our friend is suicidal and we need to call the police next time we are worried she will harm herself, how do you know when to make the call to the police and what happens after? How do they decide if she needs to go somewhere or not? I just want a little clarity on the unknowns for after you make the call to the police.",29Oct2020,1
246,"So I'm 17(M) and struggling with depression and anxiety (especially in social situations).
I'm undergoing treatment for that but the results are pretty mixed. 
The problem here is I am having some very intrusive thoughts that I can't seem to forget. 
Sometimes they are if my family loves me, if my friends love me and it has almost cost me my friendship with my best friend. 
I'm so obsessive about her that she doesn't even wanna talk to me. And when I think about it, I am noticing a pattern in my repititive thoughts. 
I was just talking to my friends and I mentioned about my habit of obsessing over friends and family and he said that maybe I'm suffering from OCD. 
I also have repititive thoughts of causing harm to people who are very cool with me. For example, my teachers, family and sometimes random people. 
I also spend a good chunk of my day ruminating about my religious beliefs and if I'm gonna go to hell or heaven. 
These thoughts are very intrusive and repititive and give me anxiety. 
I cried for 1 hour straight because I thought all of my friends were gonna leave me, I don't have a reason for that. And it has caused me mental distress and actual problems between me and my best friend. 
After reading on the internet and taking some quizzes, I suspect I am showing moderate signs of OCD.

247,"I literally do not even know where to begin. I don’t even know what I am asking for. I am just so tired. I am a huge hypochondriac and I have crippling white coat syndrome. I am using these terms loosely - I just constantly assume the worst when it comes to me being sick and the thought of going to any kind of doctor for any reason gives me insane anxiety. I just feel so stuck lately. My highs are high but my lows are so astronomically low. And I keep getting so insanely angry over the smallest things; like I was cropping a pair of pants and I accidentally cut through the sheets on my bed so I just used all my strength to rip the hole even bigger. I couldn’t carry a bunch of water bottles at once to the fridge and got angry so I threw a water bottle on the ground with literal stupid force and then open hand smacked the wall when I dropped the paper towels to clean it up. Just now I dropped some butter on the floor and got so mad I punched the kitchen countertop. I get so mad over such small things and I don’t even know why. I am so stressed all the time - I thought I was going to be at a university my freshman year of college this year but instead I ended up doing mostly all online school at a community college because of the pandemic. I don’t have my own car because my family can’t afford one for me - so I can’t get my own job. I used to have one when I had a car but the point is right now I am literally miserable. I am cooped up at home all the time and all my friends have their own cars doing their own things and I’m so jealous. I have an incurable disease called Idiopathic Intercranial Hypertension and it causes increased spinal fluid around your brain which causes headaches. I am on lifelong medication and I am supposed to be losing weight to help but it’s so hard when I am so unmotivated and just always in a funk. Every time I get a headache I don’t know if it’s my IIH flaring up or if it’s something else and it’s exhausting. I complain about being single but I’ve had multiple guys hit me up and are interested in me and I’ve even made advances on guys in the past but I get scared and ghost them or the ones that advance on me I push away and I don’t even understand why. It’s like I am incapable of love. And I feel like I don’t even understand my own sexuality either. So many of my friends are a part of the LGBTQ+ community, and I have always considered myself a huge ally, but it’s like I am afraid to be anything but straight. I am terrified to go to a therapist or psychiatrist. I don’t want to find out that something is wrong with me because of my hypochondria and my fear of doctors. And I am so scared of becoming the person who has to depend on pills to make me happy and I don’t want to be 30 and still popping antidepressants because I am incapable of being happy on my own. Absolutely nothing wrong with people who do take antidepressants - I am just so fucking scared. I feel like I am going in circles. I have such good streaks of being happy but then I just get so bad again and I don’t know what to do anymore. I was doing so good when I had a car, was going to the gym, had a job, but now I am car-less, job-less, no way to go to the gym and am stuck at home doing community online college that I hate so much. I don’t even know what I want to do because I am not passionate about anything.

248,"I made a decision today that took lots of fear, strength and tears to do... my ex bf and I had a relationship for about a year and a half, broke up but kept seeing each other due to quarantine and because we could have fun occasionally. 

Main thing that caused me to make this decision was because I took care of him even though I have been jobless now for 3 months. Started my first day at my new job today which went great luckily. So I had anxiety for days and cried over minor things. I couldn’t hold it in so I sent him a text (we have different work schedules so I couldn’t see him until the day after tomorrow) explaining how I was feeling bad and couldn’t take it anymore because he didn’t want to quit smoking weed even after he saw how it broke me and triggered me. I have childhood trauma with this and as a teen so it is still something I struggle with even after therapy... he kinda evaded it and said he wanted to talk in person. I couldn’t do that because he would weasel his way back in and I really hope I can stand my ground if he comes knocking at my door (same apartment complex). I finally said he had to leave me alone and he got defensive as if I was in the wrong and I deleted his number and everything. 

I was crying the whole time and could barely see what I was typing. No one told me letting go of someone you loved but is toxic is so freaking hard and scary. Tomorrow I have another day at work and have to wake up in 8,5 hours or so and I hope I feel better tomorrow. 

If anyone has experienced this situation and the fear that can cause an anxiety/panic attack, please tell me how to cope and what helped you calm down and smile?

255,"Hi. I am 20 years old now and I have been rather an oddity in the society. I am sort of normal to others when I talk, although I avoid social situations a lot since I have preconceptions of whether people like me or not if I show my true character. 

I believe my character at heart is that of a narcissist or extremely clingy, and I am an HSP. I want appreciation from people. Sometimes I lash out on my parents harshly.

I love my parents but I feel tied down at home. COVID has sort of isolated me from the outside of the world and that has calmed me a lot since my second year at university where my social anxiety forced me to stop attending lectures, and instead rely on podcasts. 

I am presently doing CBT, but I feel like I am not being totally honest about trying to break my fears and solve my issues. I have had a feeling I have Avoidant Personality Disorder, but I feel emotionally numb -- if someone bullies me, or if someone praises me. Sometimes I wonder why I feel that way. I feel alone and hate being that way. But at the same time I am fine living alone -- daydreaming a lot. I looked up symptoms and landed on schizoid personality disorder. 

Can I possibly have schizoid? When my grandad passed away, I was shocked, but I never cried and don't know why. I was rather on the ground and was thinking on my feet all the time when my mum cried her heart out. I honestly felt I couldn't calm my mum down or take care of her as much as I would like -- as I was dependent on my mum at that time (i was 14 at that time).

262,"I am a girl from the Netherlands. I have had mental health struggles for a *long* time... 

I guess it's partially due to being neurodivergent  (ADHD-PI and some autism traits) and... ah, please don't take it the wrong way but of above-average intelligence (High IQ, higher education, but with a big verbal-performal gap. ) that often makes life hard to navigate and can be isolating in social interactions. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had treatment for these things but only in the sense of making me functional within society. Making sure I don't miss deadlines, don't forget to respond to emails and messages, have some semblance of planning etc.

But very little in terms of how it might make me feel. I feel permanently stressed and exhausted, have big depressive episodes and even been home for a year when I had burnt out. Currently, I'm really struggling to find energy and motivation to do things that strongly matter to me! (publishing my first book, for example, it's at press but I need to do a lot of final check-ups)

I've been thinking of seeking help for my intense lethargy and loss of interest, appetite, and lack of joy in things. But I've been discouraged because I still function. I still leave my bed when I have to (Some days I stay in it but others I can create a semblance of normalcy and leave it)

I meet my deadlines, I can shower and clean up when someone comes over. Things that people tell me I wouldn't be able to do if I was depressed. Yet I feel like I actually am depressed just really good at hiding it. 

There might be a cultural component here as well because I'm from a Reformed-Protestant Dutch background where suffering is expected to be borne without complaints and you just carry on. A bit of a 'walk on your broken leg' type of hard culture. 

When researching high functioning depression a lot of the websites seem questionable. Many assert that it's not a real condition or that the medical community is still divided about it. Which makes me even more reluctant to talk about it. I really really don't want to be seen as a hypochondriac of as an attention seeker, or someone who claims mental illness when they're not actually mentally ill. But I do have a tendency to allow myself less reprieve.

265,"I'm not actually asking for myself, but so that I can give advice to my loved one on what to do when I relapse. I found a few guides on dealing with schizophrenic, persistent delusions, but none that are suitable for what I experience.

I know that I'm entering a relapse into psychosis, which includes delusions. Mine are almost always persecutory (possible things, such as being watched, someone lying or cheating, rather than aliens or magic, for example). My delusions are fairly easy to debase, and when the gaps in my logic are pointed out, I tend to break out of the delusion, though seeing the consequences tends to make me thoroughly miserable. Furthermore, they're almost always directed at the person I love. None of the guides say what to do when the delusion is against the reader.

I  (F24) have been on Fluoxetine/Prozac for 6 months now after taking it for 2 years then having a break before that.

Being back on them I've had none of the side effects including nausea, insomnia etc that I had previously when starting them, but now after 6 months or so I've started to experience the sexual side effects again (Grrr).

Hey, I dunno how to start this but I'll just say it. I(16M) genuinely can't tell what side of how I act around people is who I am.

I most recently had a bit of a panic attack while thinking about my upcoming birthday and came to a realization that I associate my online/around friends personality with me more than the one I am irl/around family. 

Let's say my name is Tyler and my friends call me Ty. I up until two years ago had been reclusive and detached from outside to my social anxiety. I met my friends online while playing solo games and came to enjoy life a lot more. Over the last 2 years I told them to call me Ty to make it easier than my online handle and they were happy to.

But now I've started disliking whenever someone calls me Tyler or any of the rest of my name, even my family. I haven't confronted anybody about this because I don't know how they're gonna react.

After some thinking I realized that I even think differently when being Ty than when I'm being Tyler and it scares me. I just don't know who I am anymore and with everything else with my life it just adds to the bs I already deal with.

Sorry if I don't make sense but I'm just scared for what/who I'm becoming. I feel happier when I'm Ty but I don't feel right just leaving my identity as Tyler behind.

278,"Hello, I'm C (19f) and new to Reddit + English is not my first language, sorry in advance for any mistakes.

I'm here to seak an advice.

Context: I'have been diagnosed with hypersensibility, an alimentary phobia (called neophobia which is a ED) and I'm a gifted person. I didn't needed a therapist since I was 11 yo but recently I had to end a very important and long (7years) friendship because the person used to be verbally abusive and (according to close people I have shared my problems) manipulative/gasligted me. I feel the need to talk to a therapist and currently can afford it (I don't know if it will be possible in the future). Moreover, the bad stuff that made me stop the friendship happened during my country lockdown and we are now having a 2nd one, I feel stressed and it remind me of what happened a few months ago.

I don't really know how to choose a therapist and I know one who is really great. I have actually seen how she works/the metgod she use and how much she care and is involved with her patients, she would be great for me.

The issue is, she used to be my ex-friend therapist during her 2nd depression and I don't know if it is a good idea to go to that therapist. It's more convenient because I wouldn't have to search for one and I know she would be adapted to my fonctioning but could it cause any issues ? I need a therapist to talk and help me deal with the loses of this friendship and to heal from the damages but will it be ok for me to go to the former therapist of the source of my problems ?

I'm also worried that my ex-friend could go back to therapy with this therapist and it could cause issues to the therapist and ""sabotage"" my or my ex-friend therapy.

Thanks for reading me. I really hope someone can help me figure this out.

If you need more informations/have questions about the context I will gladly answer.

CW: Mental health vent. You might want to read a first person perspective.

Stop telling the anxious person in your life to calm down &amp; Why I don't reach out when I'm experiencing high level anxiety: A Vent

I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was 8 years old. It was a life changing diagnosis that put me on meds and helped me immensely when it came to school and home life. What I didn't know until I was 24 - I also have panic disorder. Some psychiatrists break it down to general anxiety because some of my symptoms don't 100% match panic disorder - but I've been having moments of intense panic for a little over a year now that I have literally thought my heart might explode during. You interpret that how you will - I normally just tell people I sometimes have fancy anxiety. I don't owe you an explanation. I'm medicated. Currently thinking about possibly adjusting those meds because I think we are really close to optimum - I have had so many good days since starting this new medication last year. This is the worst day I've had in a very long time. Why?

I was beginning to trust people - I reached out today. I thought I would be met with understanding and I could talk to someone. Every. Single. Person. I talked to today other than a few who contacted me first only could offer solutions. Told me to go drink tea. Eat. Water. Bathe. Cuddle Oliver. Watch movies. Go to bed. Give myself a spa day.

The solution to my anxiety is not a cup of fricking tea, folx.

Sometimes, I sit in one area of my home and stare. Unable to get out of the ruminating circle that is my head. ADHD combined with anxiety is like that. I can go completely nonverbal bc I'm trapped with my thoughts racing. Sometimes, I'll walk into a room and forget what I was supposed to get, only to get back to my couch, blanket on, to remember, to get up, to forget again because something between here and there caught my attention and I forgot the original purpose of my trip. Similarly, during tv shows, books, games, activities at home/work - if I'm not fully invested, I get distracted. Easily. I'm incredibly worrisome, though this is one of those that I've managed to curb as I've gotten older - it still rears its ugly head here and there.

I don't have a lot of hobbies because if I commit to something - that means somehow, some way, it's able to hold 100% of my attention. I want to do something, but it takes immense brainpower and effort to even set something up, often by that time I'm exhausted and have lost all forward momentum/initiative/will. I daydream a lot. I tried not to. I can't sit still when I'm on a long personal phone call. I'm also brash, and I've been reprimanded a few times both personally and professionally. I often feel unworthy of others praise because it has taken so much brain power to keep this show on the road - I feel like others could do what I do while using less effort and wasted time. At night, it is a conscious effort and choice to 'turn off' my brain and go to sleep.

There are other, smaller to me things, such as sometimes I am told I talk too fast. I also have a lot of trouble controlling my excitement if I have a cool realization or thought in convo (another I've worked on hard), and If you text me regularly, you probably noticed I usually text in 3's unless we are legit going back and forth instantly.  
If you have anxiety - JUST anxiety - of any type - I think you've already been confused by my behaviors listed. I have a comorbid diagnosis - and I have yet to meet someone else with the same diagnosis to compare notes. ADD and ADHD function differently, and they function differently when occurring simultaneously with anxiety. And if you think they're made up, well I'm here to tell you that you're wrong. I struggled to get this diagnosis - psychiatrists have been so quick to label me as bipolar, prescribe SSRI's and mood stabilizers. I've been refused the ADHD diagnosis that I've had since I was a child as an adult simply because the doctor ""didn't believe in ADD/ADHD. I've been forced to take medications I didn't agree with out of fear of being labelled non-compliant and unable to access any medication at all. I've also gone completely unmedicated due to cost issues. (All these are side issues yes, but this is my experience)

I am super frustrated living with this - as I sit on my couch or lay in bed or the floor, unable to move, straining against the heart squeeze I feel inside while trying to calm my brain that is going miles a minute between the random and the feeling not good enough. I feel like wasted space during times like these. Others can just use a stim toy or sing a song or recite a mantra or meditate and gravity blanket their way to a non-anxious state. I get to sit and literally watch my life pass me by, yet I'm not depressed. Why don't these tips work? I get fucking distracted on my way to self-care. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I call that the evilness of this combo. Very few things work. For me, it's been medications and a medical card - and of course you're darned if you do and if you don't because there are still those who tell me I'm just a drug user and my mental illness is a crutch.

So yes, please continue to tell me I need to do any of these activities or calm down. You know who you are. Stop this. And don't anyone ever be surprised again if I tell you I am having a bad day and no, don't you dare try to help. I'm over the 'help.'

TL;dr: You shouldn't be telling your anxious friend they need to calm down because it might not just be anxiety causing their anxiousness - also stop saying ADHD isn't real.

285,"My mum (56) has always been strong and independent. She has always done things by herself and has held the family together. 

She has always had trouble getting out of bed, but she uses the excuse of working night shift. Even then, she has a lot of trouble waking up and will sometimes spend the entire day there. Recently, she has seemed really low, and has commented that she feels as though she will never be happy again. She’s also said “there’s so much to do and no money to do it” so she’s stressed. Yesterday I came home from school and she looked awful, I asked what’s wrong and she said she didn’t want to talk and to leave her alone. When I asked her later that night about Halloween, she yelled at me, got really angry, then shut down.

288,"I'm currently on medications for anxiety. I was diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD.

So whenever I get excited or worried, I cannot do anything. I have a bunch of works to do, but I can really pay attention as my mind is somewhere else. For example, I'm soon getting neuropsychological testing done next week, and I'm pretty excited about it since I wanted to get it done. And this just stops me from doing regular studying because I'm just busy thinking about it and worrying about it at the same time. And I cannot stop googling the same information that I've already read over and over again. I literally spent 6 days so far thinking about it. 

This happens to me every time with every little thing I get worried/excited about. I really try my best but it's so much more difficult for me to focus on something than a regular time. 

What can I do to help myself? I hate myself not doing anything, but soon as I try to sit down and do something it's just like I can't! And I already wasted a whole week being like this.
