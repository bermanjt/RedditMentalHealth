3,"My 29-year-old son just walked out my door, maybe for the last time. He came to see me for the last time until this is over. My kids have all seen me cry many many times, I have suffered major depression my whole life and crying is just part of it for me. But I don't know if I've ever let them see me quite the way I was today, it was like all the horror and dread I have felt in the last few years, the loss of my mother, and our current situation just exploded. He broke the social distance we are trying to observe to hug me because I couldn't stop sobbing. So he left to go home and I have no doubt that if he gets sick, and we many of us are going to get sick, he will die. My kind, smart, funny, loving, dependable, hardworking, handsome, disliked by no one, loved by all, talented son with 5 serious respiratory conditions.

4,"I have bipolar disorder, anxiety, CPTSD, and anorexia. I work in the ""call center"" part of a specialty pharmacy. There are hundreds of people in close quarters there every day, and I am the only person I've spoken to who is taking COVID-19 nearly as seriously as is needed at this point. They recently announced that they are slow rolling out a work from home trial- I am a part of the final ""stage"" of the roll out, meaning it will be a minimum of 3 weeks before I am given work from home privileges.
My mental health, my job performance, and my social standing with my coworkers has deteriorated rapidly. Where a week ago I was getting along quite well, this week I have had to go home midday due to extreme panic attacks, and I contemplate suicide all day at my desk. I am barely eating, not only due to fear of food shortages but because my eating disorder is my nearest and dearest unhealthy coping mechanism. I feel weak and dizzy, I can hardly go an hour without crying or hyperventilating, and I'm growing more and more obsessed with the idea of just ending it to escape this nightmare. My managers are sending out emails telling us that performance levels are unacceptable and commenting on whether or not I can handle my job. I need this job for healthcare and to pay bills, it pays very unusually well for my field and before this week I was perfectly content with it.
What can I do in this situation? Can I provide documentation of my diagnoses of some sort to attempt to leverage myself into earlier work from home privileges? Or at the very least is there some sort of leave I can take that won't risk my position?

5,"Who am I : A spoken word artist who has been performing for the last 3 years from Toronto to Washington DC. 

What is this: I am offering to provide line by line feedback on poems to people who use poetry to stay mentally healthy.  Just DM me the poem; and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

Why: I struggle with depression and anxiety and I write poems to be ok.  I often go to bars and poetry clubs to share my poems, and the connection I get from others hearing them is really meaningful.  I know that others feel this way too, and with bars and local shops being closed for a while, I have been reaching out to friends to feel heard and understood through my poems.  It occurred to me today that others might not have the support network I do, and at poetry gigs I normally go up to people after their poems and share a few words. I figured with us all quarantined and social distanced, this would be the next best thing.",19Mar2020,1
6,"I'm worried that the title sounds a LOT worse than it actually is, I just don't know what else to say.

My (18F) mom died 5 years ago due to cancer when I was in 7th grade. It was the first major death in my life and happened over winter break. I consider myself very lucky- the family, friends, and school faculty that I saw every day were very compassionate and understanding towards my situation. This includes my homeroom teacher, who must've felt very badly about what I was going through, so she tried to do things for me throughout the school year to care for and comfort me. The problem is, some of these things breached the line of an appropriate student-teacher relationship, like giving me a family heirloom as a birthday gift (she also told me ""not to tell anyone else"" about it), slightly excessive physical contact (hugs that lasted a little too long), etc. At the time, I didn't really recognize that these things were not completely appropriate, and even unknowingly perpetuated them at times (I would describe myself as a pretty naive kid going into middle school).

The problem now lies in the way my brain thinks following that school year- it feels like this teacher is ""stuck"" with me in some way and I can't let go. In 8th grade, I would get worried about randomly running into her in the hallway or seeing her at other school events.  I thought these little worries would dissipate once I got into high school and was away from my middle school, but it seems the opposite has happened. From freshman to senior year (now), these thoughts concerning my teacher have only seemed to grow. Sometimes it's coupled with anxiety, other times I just imagine hypothetical situations where she is near me in some way. In my junior year, I happened to notice that she was visiting my high school for some reason, and I had a physical reaction to it- my heart started racing and my hands started shaking. Following this event, my friends and I decided to visit her after school one day, to get some kind of closure. When we walked in to see her, I had physical reactions (heart rate up, shaking hands) but they went away after spending some time in the building and catching up in conversation. It was great, actually. But it didn't help.

I still have periods of thought where she's just kind of... there in the front of my mind. I've had a couple of dreams where I am back in my middle school interacting with her in some way. I've created playlists and written stories in my google docs to try and help me process how and what is going on with this situation. I've also done EMDR with a therapist (that I've been seeing for a few reasons) that helped eliminate a lot of the fear, but these thoughts still remain. I still have that family heirloom, which I actually plan on giving back to my teacher at the end of this school year (corona permitting). I'm hoping that that might give some greater closure, and maybe even maintaining contact on social media after I graduate will help equalize the situation in some way and also rid me of uncertainty in some way.

I have a pretty good idea as to *why* she treated me this way in the first place: something about my situation resonated so deeply with her that she was compelled to give me some kind of motherly attention because that's what I was missing in my life at the time. And I don't fear or dislike or blame her too harshly for what she did- sure, some of it she knew wasn't fully right, but she was trying to help and had no ulterior motive. But my brain likes to tell me that maybe she DID! Did she want me to be like her daughter? Her friend? Something else? Is she watching me right now????? It's gotten to a point where *I* feel like a creep because I get so caught up in this part of my life. Why do I do this to myself? Is it a symptom of grief? Is it trauma? Is my brain sabotaging itself, or enjoying itself with these ideas? And most importantly, *how do I stop thinking this way?* I really don't like being in this state of mind. It doesn't impact my ability to do other activities, but it does follow me around wherever I go. What the fuck is going on in my brain?????????",19Mar2020,2
7,"Hey people of reddit,i am currently facing a huge wall in my life,and no one(family&amp;friends) could help me.So i decided to ask fellow gamers and humans for a solution.
      For the past 10 years i have been gaming a lot 6-8 hours a day and well,now i realise how much it has affected me as a person.I am 18,with social skills comparable to a cucumber,which is quite sad and i do blame everything on my addiction.While everyone was out playing,being friends etc,I was locked in my room,alone with no one but my trusty computer.This was enjoyable just because i am a huge introvert with no motivation to go outside and do anything every teenager does.Now i look back at it and see,how much i have wasted..

It is the uni entrance exam year(if corona doesnt mess it up) and i realised how different and regressive i truly am.I am bad with interacting with other humans,which has led me to be always alone, burried in books while everyone is outside in cafes,restaurants, you name it.Hell i cant even walk into Mcdonalds without getting anxiety.

To fix this, i decided to slowly drop gaming and start socializing.But i have realised how boring it is without my games.I just do my homework,play guitar and thats it,just stare at walls and just sit.Homework is the only thing that has me occupied and interested in.I do have many ""friends"" but its so hard to interact with them while having totally different interests.I feel like an old person that is 18 really.Things normal teenagers like, i hate.
I really dont want to seem like a snowflake who is different then others.I want to understand the joy of interacting and doing dumb stuff which will fill me with life.This fact has bothered me for so long and is so painful when i realise how lonly and uninteresting i am.I do even have a huge crush on a girl but i know if we even get together i will be so uninteresting that break up will be iminent.So i ask you,what would you do in my position?",19Mar2020,2

12,"Title says it all really.... 

(This is basically one huge rant &amp; I’m sorry)

I am sick to the fucking back teeth of corona virus this, corona virus that.... idiots on Facebook saying shit like “if you use the loo, drop the seat and lid, flush then covered your face... then wash your hands with bleach” 

Putting your hands over your face, before fucking washing them.... are you for fucking real? 

But also the fact of I’m myself at high risk of if I contract it, I could die easier than most (I have Cerebral Palsey. The source for this was on the NHS website if anyone asks) literally it’s damaging my mental health.... 

Today though, I really lost my fucking shit.... 

I went out on my motorcycle this morning just to get out because it’s my therapy &amp; makes me happy. I rode my motorcycle into my town (2 minute drive) and went into a store to purchase tobacco, I am well known where I live &amp; the people who work in the store know me, know I have a motorcycle etc. So I went in, leaving my lid on because of all this shit, I don’t need some idiot coughing at me etc. I walked up to the counter &amp; the old lady behind the counter had PVC gloves on, but NO face mask or anything else of the sort, just PVC gloves... I asked for tobacco &amp; she tells me to remove my motorcycle helmet. 

So I said back “why do you have gloves on?” She asked me to remove my helmet, so again I asked “why are you wearing gloves?” She said “because of the virus”. So I said “why do you think I’m wearing my helmet then?” 

She refused to serve me till I removed my lid, so I took it off, dropped my balaclava down to my bottom lip &amp; she got the Bakki, by the time she turned back round to face me, I had put my lid back on. She just stared at me....

I said “what’s wrong now?” She didn’t say anything, so again I said “what?” But rather sternly, she said “ I asked you to remove your helmet” I said “I did, now you have seen my face, I put it back on” I took the Tobacco from her &amp; paid, upon leaving I said to her “what you’re doing is fucking pointless, you don’t even have face protection, what you’re doing is pointless, I’m glad you didn’t cough all over me” yeah maybe I shouldn’t have said it, but I was annoyed. 

Like just everything is fucking annoying me.... due to my health conditions, I was supposed to have a muscular skeletal appointment on the 17th of March, but was cancelled because it wasn’t essential.... well it fucking was I’m in constant pain due to my heath conditions....

Being completely honest here, I actually hope I catch the COVID-19 virus &amp; die soon or hopefully I have like undiagnosed cancer or something seriously wrong with me. I actually want to die, but I won’t commit suicide.....

The cancer thing, for the past 4 years I’ve had testicular lumps, I’ve kept being told they are just epididymal cysts, yet not once have I been offered an ultra sound test which will confirm what these testicular lumps are.....

Alongside that I get groin pain, lower back pain etc.... you can work out what dr.google suggests.... (Cancer)

I keep getting chest pains &amp; my left arm goes numb occasionally.... you can work out what dr.google suggests there too (Heart attack) 

I’m having constant headaches, my depression is at an all time high, so Is my anxiety.... even my miso phobia is going crazy at the moment....

I literally fucking hope I die soon, I have fucking had enough... I won’t commit suicide as that’s cowardly.... but if I caught the CoronaVirus, I’d more than happily let it kill me, no questions asked.... 

Sorry for this rant, this hasn’t accomplished anything obviously, but these past few weeks I’m having an absolute fuck full....

Anyone else feel like this????",19Mar2020,1

14,"First off, I want to start this post by saying that I am an 18 year old girl, who has struggled with depression, anxiety, and eating disorders, all of which were diagnosed but never really treated. On all those issues I am doing better, but recently I have been struck with a new possible problem... 

Well, actually it has been an ongoing problem that has been brought to my attention. I do not think that I feel most emotions. I have always had the inkling that my experience was not normal, but figured that I was being dramatic, however i cannot get it out of my head due to a conversation I had with my brother a few days ago(God I hope he does not find this) where he made a comment about how he thought it was funny that I just did not care. I asked him what he meant and he just explains that I just do not care: happy occasions, sad occasions, receiving gifts no matter how amazing, our grand parents death, etc. He commented how I was a good actor, but he could tell since there was no emotion in my eyes... 

That has always been how I felt. For as long as I can remember I have never felt excited, happy, sad, etc. It's always been this sort of numb feeling I guess, but I know I can feel anxiety and anger. Anger does not happen too often, but I know it can be explosive when it does, and anxiety comes and goes often with certain triggers. I know I feel them because I feel it in my chest, I guess and honestly I cannot control them. I control my laughter and my tears but like my brother said there is nothing behind my eyes... 

It does not really bother me honestly. I mean some times it does. I would like to feel happy, excited, sad... I am not trying to be some emo r/iamverybadass type person. This is honestly a cry for help, and maybe some insights on what is going on in other's hearts and minds, as I do not have someone in person to confine in.",19Mar2020,2
15,"So I was roleplaying with a girl sexually online... probably not the best idea... I did know her irl though and yeah... I don’t do that with people I don’t know in real life. So this all happened yesterday too

Anyway, I suddenly started imaging myself as her character and I feel like I slowly started being attracted to mine. It took time but I feel like it was happening. It felt super weird. I didn’t know what was going on and it was the worst. I thought it would just pass so I kept roleplaying because I didn’t wanna stop it for her.

I understand where shes coming from, and clearly this is a problem for me...but it just really hurt to hear. I teared up because I was so angry at myself and embarrassed.

18,"Hi All--

So I've been practicing social distancing for almost three weeks now, with full isolation just kicking in this week. I have ADHD and anxiety/OCD, and it has been *rough*: remembering to take meds, keeping to any sort of schedule, dealing with the massive amount of negativity on the Internet. Every ""morning"" (which is now b/t 3 and 5 pm), I spend about an hour curled up, undergoing a wracking, overwhelming Panic Cry.

All this is to say: I don't want anyone else to feel this way. And I believe I don't have to get lost in these feelings either. We are stronger together. So I'm offering myself and my time to anyone who needs it. Hmu via reddit chat if you need to talk, if you need to feel a little bit less alone. I don't promise to have answers, but I promise to respond. To listen. To be there. Please, *please* don't hesitate to reach out.

19,"I haven't told a doctor this, but sometimes I feel like two different people in one body. sometimes (rarely) the 'two people' will fight and the mental pane is insanely agonizing. when this happens, all I want is to stop it; slam my head against something, anything. just stop the pain at all costs, even if it means brain damage or suicide (luckily I haven't yet failed to hold myself back). usually though, the 'two people' are separate; one being the part of me that wants to commit suicide and self harm and hates life, the other being the part of me that loves live and wants to live and live a great life.

also, this only happens when I can't cope in some way, it never happens when I can cope using electronics because they're the only thing i'm good at using, but ever since my mom died, I my legal guardian limits my electronic usage way too much(1-2 hours a day). now the only way I can cope is self harm, and that doesn't usually last that long.

21,"Hi, I live in England (North East) and i'm 22 years old. I've struggled with my mental health my whole life and i hit a crisis point a few days ago after something traumatic happened. Where I live, there is an NHS mental health facility which accepts self referrals for people who have hit a crisis point, and i'm going to go voluntarily tomorrow to as for help. They have an inpatient facility which i may end up having to stay in.

I'm wondering if anyone on here has stayed in an NHS inpatient facility? How was your experience? Would you recommend it? Which area was it in? Which NHS trust is the best? What sort of things would i need to take with me?

 I hate hospitals, so i feel very scared about going, but i think it would be for the best and it would one million percent be worth it if it works and i get some kind of help, whether it be medication, a diagnosis, therapy or a CMHT.

Or would it be better to go to a private healthcare provider? What would be the difference? My Dad has said he's willing to sell his car if it means that I get the best treatment for myself. (He can no longer drive due to disability, however, he kept his car because it is now considered a classic car and it is in very good condition. He's had it since he was 16 and he loves it a lot.) Therefore, if there is little to no difference, i'd rather go with the NHS so he doesn't have to sell his car. If anyone has any stories or advice i'd be very grateful :)",19Mar2020,1
22,"I remember 2020 coming around the corner and feeling energized/hopeful about a lot of things. I made a list of lessons I vowed to keep. I closed two deals in January and was leading my team in sales. I met a girl at a bar and we still talk to this day. I can remember smiling randomly on my walk to work and overall, feeling **great**.

I remember calling my dad and just being like ""dude, this is crazy. Every girl looks at me when I walk by. **Every one**. My friends make me feel like I'm the life of the party. I just feel really good right now and I'm trying to figure out why."" He offered no real helpful/valuable input but it was worth a shot.

It was nuts man. Literally every girl I'd walk past, I'd get a look. I can remember really hot girls just being around in me in public noticing me. And on top of that, I just felt fucking great in general.

I think a lot of this had to do with being excited about meeting a new girl, closing two good deals, and getting back in the gym. I think overall, these things compounded each other.

Until one day, I went on Reddit, and I posted a message very similar to this one, only my goal was to get feedback on ""why are all these good things happening to me"". I deleted that post 5 minutes later because I was scared that I jinxed the entire thing.

Well, the next morning, on my walk to work I just felt like no one noticed me anymore, and I saw maybe one decently attractive girl but she didn't even notice me.

I felt all around anxious again. My resting facial expression changed into something of confusion while walking/listening to music.

My posture got weaker, and I got weaker because I felt like whatever was going on, was out of my control.  


What was going on and what can I do to get back to that?

**TL:DR** \- with turn of 2020 was just feeling very positive. Girls were coming out of the woodwork in public all around me/noticing me, I met a new girl that I was crazy about, I got back in the gym, I had a good month in business, my friends made me feel like the life of the party. In general I just remember feeling fucking awesome. All of this was going great until one day I made a post on reddit saying all of the above only to ask what redditors thought was going on (in the universe, with my thoughts, how people perceived me, etc.) - basically any input on what I can do to keep the positive juices flowing.

All my life I have felt like I’m just completely stupid. I’m a little air headed naturally, things go over my head and I miss the point of most conversations that go beyond what I know. I’ve always been horrible with numbers. Simple math stuff like that. I basically didn’t absorb anything after 4th grade as far as math classes go. I failed all my math classes every single semester, managed to become president of the engineering club ONLY because the club sponsor was attracted to me. I didn’t know what I was doing at all. I suck at almost every job I get. I don’t mean to do anything half-assed, but when I work on a task at work I almost always am made to redo it because I didn’t do it well enough. Once I was made to re-vacuum a hallway three times. It’s not that I’m lazy, I try my best, I just really can’t do simple tasks the way I’m expected to. I can’t do any kind of sports, I was laughed at in 7th grade during field day because I couldn’t throw a softball farther than 5feet in front of me. I’m not overweight or unhealthy, I just literally suck. I faked a migraine that day so I could go home. The bullying was so bad. My brain shuts off when someone is trying to explain something to me and I start to realize I don’t understand it. It makes it hard for me to learn anything. It took me forever to learn how to drive and I still am horrible at it. Every car I buy ends up with bumps and scrapes and dents all over it by the time I’m done with it. I don’t talk about it, but it hurts me a lot. It’s come to a point where I just know I can’t do certain things. I don’t even try anymore. I know I’ll be bad at it.

I had a traumatic event happen when I was 16 and feel like my mental health has only declined since. I use to at least have hope for my future but now I feel completely stuck and trapped. I live with my bf in my parents house and my parents are both very toxic people. We can't afford to move out though and my bf supports me financially in most areas and is a great partner but I've been dealing with extreme guilt for the fact I don't contribute to anything. I've only had 1 job and it was before the trauma and haven't been able to motivate myself to work again since. I am on antidepressants (Wellbutrin and Lexapro) and also use medical marijuana daily. I've applied for disability before because I also have physical issues but my mental health is the main reason I don't work. My application was denied bc I guess some of the info was incorrect and my anxiety was so extreme that I never called back to fix anything. I have really severe anxiety about phone calls for some reason and have probably lost some opportunities just because of refusing to answer the phone. I feel like I'm being so childish and pathetic and can't even make appointments for myself. My bf reassures me that he understands and it's okay that I'm unable to make money right now but I feel like a spoiled brat. Since I started dating him I've completely isolated myself from everyone else bc he makes me feel safe and comfortable and now all I want to do is stay home and be with him and even when he's not here I still have no motivation to keep up with friendships and talk to people. I don't even have my licence because of this crippling anxiety. I feel like a complete failure in every aspect of life. I have tried many different medications and unfortunately haven't been able to maintain therapist appointments (once again cuz of anxiety) and also can't afford the ones that you can just text and stuff. I do have coping outlets like art and writing etc but at the end of the day I still feel empty and lost and trapped. I've tried selling my art before without much luck, I've also tried making and selling my own eyeshadows on Etsy but didn't get much profit at all, I've done people's makeup and nails for money but honestly don't know enough people or have enough supplies to keep up with that and also my anxiety has caused me to say no to quite a few opportunuties. I feel like I'm very not normal and just can't understand why I don't seem to have the same motivation that everyone else does. I know all of this is my fault and people think I'm just being lazy but I'm just terrified and so sick of myself. I use to self harm and was hospitalized 3 times but haven't done that in 2 and a half years now and still don't intend to do it because I know it hurts people who care about me. I just feel pathetic. Because of me staying home and literally just sitting around all the time I've developed back issues and gained a lot of weight which in return causes even more self esteem issues and less motivation to do anything not only because I hate how I look but because of the pain it causes my back now. I want this to end and I really would love creative ideas on how I can maybe take some baby steps to living a more normal life. I appreciate any advice you're willing to give",19Mar2020,2

32,"I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this because I've only read a few posts. I don't know how to correctly express what I've struggled with for essentially my whole life, but I'll do my best. For a long time I've been a self-dkagnosed perfectionist, and it started as somewhat of a prideful thing, where I would always have better work than everybody else because ""oh, I'm such a perfectionist, ooh look at me, I'm so great."" But lately it's turned into a roadblock. I'm only half-assing my work, and it's purely because of the fact that if I don't try, I dont have to be ashamed of bad work. All of this (which has been going on for almost 5 years now) has been giving me some serious problems with my anxiety. Somewhat recently I had a severe anxiety attack where I was sitting on the floor, shaking, and bawling. This isn't really a post asking for help, I guess I'm more just looking for confirmation and recognition. Should I just try to ""get my shit together"" as I've been told so many times? Or is this actually something that needs to be addressed?",19Mar2020,2

34,"I had a rough night last night. I was panicking and my legs felt like they were cramping up really really badly. I felt like my muscles were seizing and like my tendons were so tight that I couldn't even fully straighten my legs.
Well I turned a light on and checked and my legs were actually straight. I clenched my muscles as hard as I could and let them go and it was obvious that I could clench them tighter than they were, so they couldn't actually have been painfully clenched, right?? I thought my calf muscles were rock hard but they weren't actually much firmer than they usually are.
I'm really confused if this counts as a hallucination or a delusion or what! I can't tell if I'm being irrational by assuming it wasn't real and there's flaws in my tests... sorry I know this is weird.

I come home to it spotless and seeing him clean the same areas for the past 3 days.

38,"When I was 13-16 I had trouble even seeing myself in the mirror especially if I wasn’t at home I would go into like a panic mode worrying that I didn’t look normal because that was the way I saw myself. I’m 17 now and I’m a lot better at accepting it for what it is but it still affects me a lot I have trouble seeing my friends because I feel like the ugly one in the group I guess.
I don’t think they’d judge me for who I am but I can’t stop obsessing over the way I look. 

I look almost anorexic but I eat fine it’s just genetics, I have a small head and it makes it really difficult to pick a hairstyle especially because my hair cowlicks all over the place so I almost wanna go bald but what stops me is the fact that when I picture myself bald I’d look really weird. If I did I’d probably wear a beanie and it’s really hot at the moment so it’s kinda difficult. 

I’ve had supportive people give me the love yourself for who you are type speeches and stuff but I don’t think I could even if I tried. I don’t want to go on antidepressants because they fuck with me and there just yuck but if anyone has any advice I’d like to hear it",19Mar2020,1

40,"My whole life I have felt very different. It’s caused a lot of trouble for me in dealing with situations and social interactions. I’m hoping if I can pinpoint what’s going on I can find a way to navigate life a little better. Please be kind because I have never told anyone all of this and it took a lot of courage to be open and honest about it. 

1) a lot of times I can’t put into words what I’m thinking even if it’s something really simple. I am actually pretty intelligent but come off unintelligent sometimes because I can’t get my words out. 

2) sometimes, because of this, I end up saying a more simple version of what I’m thinking and many times I end up not making sense or offending other people.

3) Sometimes, when I do say things that are well thought out, people don’t understand what I’m saying, even though it makes perfect sense. 

4) Sometimes I feel like I’m simulating a personality. I don’t know how to think or act a lot of the time. I’ve watched other people’s behaviors and picked up things that I find pleasant in other people. I change my laugh every few years when I found one that sounds more appropriate. 

5) I believe I have imposter syndrome 

6) I can’t tell when people don’t like me, unless they’re super vocal about it. I don’t know if it’s because people are being fake and simulating niceness or if I’m just not picking it up. 

7) it doesn’t seem like anyone understands my intentions. Sometimes when I try to connect with people I don’t know well, I feel that the conversation offends them. I feel like when I talk about things that I believe may help them feel similar or connected to me, I appear as though I am bragging, even if I am not.  

8) I have impulsive thoughts, like saying or doing something that might catch someone off guard. For example, there was an older bald guy speaking to me one day, and the thought of giving him a huge smooch on the lips popped in  my head. It was gross and really embarrassing and it was nothing from attraction at all whatsoever just a very impulsive thought. Other impulsive thoughts would be like telling someone they’re ugly or something terrible like that. I feel so bad because I’m a nice person and I literally would never ever say something to hurt someone like that. 

9) when people I don’t know well talk to me, I have to try really hard to figure out where to look while they’re talking. A lot of times I’ll just look away to think while they are speaking so I don’t focus on the movement of their mouth and can actually listen. 

10) I am diagnosed with ADD and anxiety

11) I learn that a behavior is inappropriate or annoying only when someone does it to me and I don’t like it. There have been a few times where my husband has had to kindly tell me in social situations that certain things Im saying or talking about are inappropriate. 

12) When I’m alone and thinking, I catch myself making faces that go alone with the conversation I’m thinking about. I remember getting made fun of for this when I was in middle school. As an adult, I’ve been able to catch when I do this and control it. 


Despite all of this, the older I get, the better I am able to blend in. I don’t think people have any idea that all of this goes on in my head. I am seemly normal, married, and I have friends. I’ve been afraid of coming out about this because I don’t want to be brushed off and give people the impression that I am overemotional, crazy, or just overthinking. I’ve tried to open up about my ADD symptoms before and of course it was shrugged off. So I felt like if I opened up about all of this other stuff, somehow people would invalidate my feelings and tell me they’re not real. 

If you got through all of this, thank you so much for reading and for any thoughts you share with me.",19Mar2020,1
41,My county is I believe the most infected in CA. This is already worrisome. Then my doctor flat out told me to not leave my house until further notice because if I get infected I will die. I'm on the waiting list (1-2 months) for an eating disorders IOP and hope things are better by then. With my ED sometimes I hope I'll die. But with this virus I just want to live through it. Its overwhelming. The anxiety never ends. I feel like either way I have no future. The only positive thing in my life right now is that the cocktail of meds I'm on make me sleep without nightmares for 12hrs a night. Depakote geodon lunesta zyprexa gabapentin lamictal does it for me.,19Mar2020,1
42,"Okay, so, it's been a while (it really hasn't.) I'm alive, and, not too well, unfortunately. 

I'm still stuck in this box that's slowly closing in around me, and I believe will one day crush my bones into dust and leave me unrecognizable. This guilt I feel, it doesn't seem to have a trigger, a time of day/month/year/etc., it just comes around whenever the hell it wants, and it's driving me crazy. I know I'll be able to go into therapy soon, (well, not as soon as it used to be because of Corona,) but I really can't take this. It feels like my bones are going to rip open my skin and flee. The goosebumps on my arms leave me with hairs that stick up like pins. I can't sleep it off, I can't eat it off, I can't think it off, I can't get rid of it. It's no use.

I'm not suicidal, nor have I ever been, and I don't want to die. I actually have a rather irrational fear of death, but sometimes I just wish I could fall into a pit with no bottom, where my thoughts would just be quiet. But no matter how silent it is around me, my conscience is deafening. 

I feel like if I don't find help-- Therapy, meds, whatever that may be, (as much as I hate both of those things)-- then I'll lose my shit. And I very well could. At any moment, I feel like I could just say ""fuck it,"" and literally start wailing at the top of my lungs and ripping out my hair in clumps. I've never self-harmed, but this body doesn't belong to me, and I find myself wanting to cut it down the middle with a chainsaw. 

I don't talk to my mom or most friends about this, because I don't want to worry them or make them think I wanna hurt myself (because I don't,) or make them feel the way I'm feeling. 

The reason I'm feeling this guilt is because of things... said and done... by family members. One of these family members-- I know with 100% certainty-- would never mean to hurt me or put all this shit onto my shoulders, and so I don't want to tell them, because I'm afraid that I'll make them feel guilty for making me feel guilty.

It'd be a neverending shit cycle...!

I'm literally out of options, and  I'm ready to take advantage of this quarantine and curl up in my bedsheets and sob myself to sleep, where I'll inevitably wake up and have to deal with this shit all over again.

46,"I am living in New York City, and have been struggling deeply with the circumstances surrounding this pandemic. Our city has not reacted quickly enough, we are all unprepared and many of us not practicing social distancing. 
I am only 21 years old and as of Saturday was smart enough to truly realize the weight of the situation and have not socialized since. Due to the virus’s insane incubation period(s) it is safe to say, that many of us, including myself may already be infected. 
Though the last couple weeks before schools closed here,  I practiced conscious hygiene, I wore surgical gloves on the subway and washed my hands and sanitized my phone, the virus had made its way to the city long before we caught on to its airborne-like nature. 
I am worried for my grandmother who is a life long smoker, and my mother who is very overweight, and my sister who is also very overweight and has a history of pneumonia and has asthma. I myself have asthma. I am fearful that if I am, or my family, are to fall ill our hospitals will have reached overcapacity and our situation would be severely compromised.  
I am suffering extreme anxiety attacks as I sit in our tiny apartment watching our doomsday situation unfold. How slow we are reacting, and how this virus acts as a slow burning, torturous, and sneaky little assassin. The number predictions for mortality rates continue to excel and we are seeing more and more healthy younger people become infected and becoming extremely ill. 
We have no means to run, flee, relocate. We are stuck in a hot spot as our government does nothing to contain this issue, people are forced to continuing working, and people are still socializing. I am terrified for my family’s life and mine. 
I have been experiencing a sore throat, light and dry cough, and occasional phlegm which does not help my anxiety. For all I know, my symptoms can become worse at any moment.",19Mar2020,1

Feeling rejected and unloved and like you weren't doing enough and being told certain things were your fault when they weren't and anytime I brought up the issues, it was me asking too much, Etc etc. My point is, ever since then I cannot listen to the office theme song without starting to panic. It was my exs favorite show and he made a parody of it for the school band trip and I remember the uncontrollable feeling of doom I got that night. It's strange, I cannot listen to the theme song.

I live with a religious family,you probably know where this is going.So one day I was at my best friend’s house and then I saw her big sister walked in and at that moment I thought she was hot!and so I told her and we got into a secret relationship without my best friend knowing.I would sneak out to meet her and we’ll have fun till morning.But they all say “all good things must come to an end”we were cuddling and then her sister walked in on us and then she said in this cold blooded voice”I knew u guys had a thing”and she left.But this good thing is she didn’t tell my family but the bad thing is that I lost my girlfriend and my only best friend:(so I convinced my mom to move to the USA and she listened and she did.After a couple of months living in the us,I was telling my mom about this lesbian couple at school and she turned to me and said”listen,those little things are nasty!i don’t want you hanging around them!they are a disgusting!”After I heard that I just laughed it off and agreed with her:(after we got home I told my dad and he said “ew,I hate those little things!why are they even alive?”and the fact that he says that too crushed my heart.So I told my sister the Same thing and she was disgusted,I didn’t know what to do.I then realize if I tell my family then they wouldn’t talk to me anymore and disowned me...so I kept quiet for a long time until I got a boyfriend and I told him I like girls too and he said “that’s fine,I will always love you “two days after saying that he broke up with me.At this point I feel like no one loves me or cares about me so i started self harming..not a sense of cutting but starving myself that was my way out!i kept doing it every day and you know no one noticed for 2 years!so I decided to kill myself I wrote my suicidal note and left it on my bed and then I just got the bottle of pills and took all of them and sat there waiting for something to happen..then I felt the pain in my head,it felt like someone just hit me with a pan and then I felt sleepy,my belly hurts and I started vomiting!my sister heard me and drove me to the hospital and they stopped the pain:(they asked what happen?and I replied saying”I ate something while I was out with my friends “and they believed me.After two hours in the hospital I realize the suicidal is on my bed so I told my dad I was ready to leave and they brought me home and I ripped the paper in 24 pieces (I remember the pieces because that day I tried killing my self)and I have them in a box which is under my bed right now.After two months,I started to feel no emotions to nothing!I was numb and I don’t care...so kept being that way till today.Sadly there is no happy ending to my story and I am still depressed till this day and no one notices:(",19Mar2020,1
51,I really don’t want to live through seeing loved ones die and being on a virtually lockdown from life the next 1.5 years.

54,"I think this is a symptom of depression, but it doesn’t feel like depression. I’m not sad, I don’t want to die, I have aspirations and goals and such, it’s just that I don’t ever want to do anything. I’m going to try and describe it in a way that doesn’t make it sound like I’m just lazy: 

I literally have no motivation for anything. I know I have to do things, yet I don’t do them. I have to set alarms to eat meals or I forget, same with drinking water. I used to live reading and now it’s just something to do so I don’t feel like I’ve fully wasted my day, I don’t even really enjoy it anymore. Being on my phone bores me, watching TV bores me, working out bores me, it’s like I have no opinions on anything. I don’t feel like I hate anything, but I don’t feel like I like anything. Everything’s the same for me. The things I do, I do because someone tells me to. I painted the basement because my mom asked me. I walked the dog because my mom asked me. I feel like I’m not feeling any emotions. Even little things I used to enjoy, like crappy reality Tv shows, don’t interest me, I just zone out or sleep. Things I used to hate don’t make me mad anymore. 

Some past history: I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and anxiety-induced depression, which I haven’t felt for over 2 years. I think I might be bipolar (runs in the family), because I sometimes swing between these types of emotion where I feel like I’m the worlds most boring character in the worlds most boring book, and then doing a million things at once, adopting a million passions, waking up at 2am to workout or to clean my room. Sometimes I get super super angry at very small things (although I think this is more environmental than chemical since my mother has some anger issues due to a diagnosed bipolar disorder). 

I can’t really go to therapy right now. My mom (the parent I live with), works for the government and is super scared the gov is going to shut down and she won’t get paid, so she doesn’t want to waste money on unnecessary things. I went to therapy for a while for anxiety/family issues. 

So that’s my little rant. Any advice would be greatly appreciated because I don’t really like feeling like this, I’d actually prefer to be super anxious than to not feel anything. I’ve tried meditation, working out, faking happiness/emotions until it actually happens, most of that type of thing, without success. But if you think maybe I’m just being lazy, please tell me, maybe that will snap me out of it more if I can see myself from another perspective.",19Mar2020,1
55,"I (13f) am so stuck. I get pulled in so many ways, people in related to and close to tell me I'm pretty and beautiful while peope I don't know call me ugly. Everyone I know thinks I'm annoying. I grow unstable and ask for help so my friend tell me I'm crazy and my family and other people that don't know me tells me I'm fine. I've gotten so many mixed signals from people that I'm scared to do anything that involves what I think is ok. I feel like I'll be abandoned and hated if I make someone mad or upset.

I have gotten used to wearing a mask and only taking it off when I'm alone. But I used to cry a lot at night, I would go into hyperventilation and what i think is a depressive episode. But now I don't feel saddness. I don't get angry unless something really bad happens. I don't feel empathy or sympathy.  I just feel numb or happy. 

I smile at things people cry at, like the main character in the video committing suicide because the people that made them feel they had to felt sad and guilty. I smile at the thought of killing people I hate. I've lost my ability to recognise when I'm crossing a line. My friend was cyber bullied a while ago so I found the guys Instagram, which lead to his YouTube, tik tok, and phone number. I then tried tracking his address, name, ect. I didn't see it as wrong. I still don't but ive left it alone.

Things that used to make me break down and cry now make me smile. Heck normally I'd cry while typing this but I'm smiling. I've learned to put others before myself because I'm not as important as other people. No matter what it is its always ""be quiet this person's talking"" or no matter what I needed ""it'll have to wait a minute"". I feel like I'm being pushed away from my friend group because they all act as if I matter less and less. They do things to me that I would get yelled at for if I did to them.

I ask for counceling and I got it! But the school closed so no more counceling unless it's necessary. Anytime I talk people listen for a few seconds before ignoring me again then they yell at me for interupting them. Just today I tried helping someone who i think was suicidal and they just got mad at me, degraded me for not knowing what its like to have their problems, and overall said I couldn't help because of my age. They deleted their account though and for some reason I don't care.

No one will take me to a doctor to get diagnosed or see if its just depression. It's like they say they care but they refuse to show it. I'd probably be given medication and possibly therapy.. My mom can't afford therapy and she says that insurance would only cover it if a doctor said I needed it. She hasn't taken me to the doctor.

I wanted to develop a tulpa and I told my friend my choice. She basically said that i was making myself scitzophrenic to deal with loneliness. My mom and step dad both prioritize video games over me but not my sister. However I'm suppose to watch her 24/7. They get mad at me because i can't handle her and its my fault no one has told me how. It's always ""come get us"". I get yelled at almost every day because she wants to play and o can't play with her without her getting to excited which gets me yelled at. Then I get yelled at if I don't play with her cause she gets upset and I get angry. 

I just realized that without school I can hide things like cuts better. And that if my sister ever stops loving me I'll have nothing to live for. And to anyone still reading it probably sounds like I'm just an attention seeker. That's why I get downvote and almost no comments right? Or is it because I'm so far gone that no one knows how to help me? This probably won't be seen by a lot of people and I'm ready to accept that.

Congrats if you made it this far doubt many people did. Comment advice if you want, doubt anyone will. And if your gonna down vote then go right ahead I'm prepared for that to and i honestly don't care anymore. If you wanna send tips or advice on what i can do I live in Ohio. Further information will have to be disclosed privately.",19Mar2020,1

I thought that it was temporary because I was kinda tired and I thought in the morning I would go back to normal. But it never did, and now it’s been months and I’ve found new friends to hang around with.
    When I was little, before my parents became excessively abusive, they were actually pretty good parents. But I didn’t love them. As a little kid, it kind of bothered me but I didn’t think much of it because I was young and I didn’t really have complex thoughts yet. But I knew there was something wrong. I understood that when you loved someone you felt something almost warm in your heart. But I didn’t feel much towards my parents. I brushed away the thought, and as I got a bit older I believed that I truly loved my parents, mostly because I would say I love you and my mom would ask if I loved her and I’d say yes, and I guess that convinced me into into I really did care about my parents. 
    But as I became older, I started to sense gaps. I couldn’t care. 
    My morality compass isn’t broken, and I know right from wrong, but I don’t really care. Even if I know what I’m doing is wrong, I’ll do it without giving a fuck. I can emphasize with peoples emotions, but I can’t sympathize with them. So I understand what they’re feeling, but I don’t feel bad with them.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me :( but I want to figure out",19Mar2020,1

I'm currently part time at my job but I typically make enough to get the bills paid and still have some to put back. I'm happy with my job and I adore my kids and my wife. I dont understand why I have no energy towards cleaning my home. I dont know why I get so short with my wife and give her an attitude so often. She has anxiety and Is a for real a hypochondriac.

I hate the state of my home I used to be so organized but my life is so disorganized that it puts me in moods.

I looked up the symptoms and I seem to have a decent amount of symptoms from both diagnosis. 

I plan on going to my doctor after all this virus stuff slows down what kinds of questions should I ask my doctor or what should I tell them?

One of my past love interests is also a friend of mine. I’ve been very open to all of my friends about what me and my ex went through in hopes that they might be a little sensitive or something. My friends ignore me all the time to pay attention to my ex. Not only is it insulting and hard to feel like the second choice/rebound friend, but it’s also hard to watch people flirt with my ex all the time cause I’m not completely over them.

I have a history of self harm but it’s been 3 months since i last cut myself. Last May I left a toxic relationship. My ex (i’m gay btw) was my best friend for the 3 years we were together. We were in the same friend group in high school and started dating when i was 16. While we were together he was the only person i talked to about my mental health, some other close friends had a vague idea of what I was going through but I told my ex everything. Now I’m a sophomore in college and have a great group of friends at school (2 of them are from that same group in high school but they aren’t close with my ex anymore) but I don’t feel comfortable reaching out to anyone for help. I think i’ve convinced myself that since it’s been so long since we broke up i should be over it by now. i’m 100% over my ex i was happy to dump him but i think i’m still affected by the trauma. I honestly feel paralyzed. My life revolved around my ex for so long that I’m not really sure how to be vulnerable with anyone else. I’m not really sure how to move on in life so i guess im looking for advice on how to deal with trauma from a toxic/mentally abusive relationship. Any advice on how to move on/feel comfortable opening up to people again is appreciated. I’m sorry if this post doesn’t make sense or doesn’t belong here.

65,"Hi, English is not my first language and I'm mobile, so... Anyways, I think that maybe I have depression due to being so sensitive, crying on a stupid comment on facebook. A little about myself: I'm 24f and a college student. I used to be a smart kid. Not a genius or something but I can understand things quicker than normal kids. My parents took me to test my IQ and it's around 135 to 140. I don't remember exactly. Everything was fine, school was amazing until I got into an accident when I was in 10th grade. A drunk driver hit me when I was on my bicycle. I didn't have any serious injury, just a big bump on my head. My parents took me to the hospital and I was fine or that's what we thought. Soon I realized that I became more and more stupid. I couldn't understand Math or Physic anymore (they were my favorite subjects). Things got worse when I went to college. I constantly failed a tons of classes. That's when I started to think that I was a loser, a worthless person. I used to have the pride of be the smartest one, now I'm always the stupidest. When my friends went out to party or dating, I stayed home stick to my phone. My childhood friend went to the same college but one year later than me. I must dropped out long time ago without her support. Now she graduated and has a decent job now but I'm still stuck here. My parents pay for my college fee so I feel extremely guilty about the money they've been wasted on me. They're not rich nor poor. College is not just my dream but my father's too. Because my brother didn't go to college (he didn't want to, now he also has a great job), my father want me to do it for him. Although he doesn't say it but I can tell that he's disappointed in me. Due to corona epidemiologic situation, I started to take online classes lately. It took me four hours straight to do my homework yesterday, just some yes or no questions. This morning, I got into a stupid fight with some random person on internet. He ended up call me a ""stupid cow"" and it hurts me so bad that I busted into tears. Like all the thoughts about me being worthless kicked in. I cried for a while. Me, a stupid cow, have no talent, look or anything. I just feel lost.

66,"I'm sorry but this is gonna be quite long...

Ive always had a bad relationship with my mom growing up. My dad left us when i was about 10 since he came out as gay and found a new partner. I hardly have contact with him as we've grown distant despite always being a daddy's girl when i was younger. Prior to my dad leaving my parents would always fight. My dad started blaming me for their divorce/ separation. I live with my mom and she and I don't get along. There isnt a day where she hasnt called me fat, or her bringing me down. She despises me so much. I resemble my dad so much from face to personality that she always nitpicks on me for that. ""Oh you're just like your father"" or ""your father may have left but i feel like hes still here."" (she was talking about me) she doesn't like my dad. Growing up i dealt with alot of bullying which she didnt care much about. In highschool I also faced bullying which she didnt act on or care about either. She would just tell me how i was weak, too sensitive and too dramatic. I ended up feeling depressed when i was 12 and self harmed for a year before she wound out. She threatened to send me away to our home country and called me ""sick"" I did get child therapy but she never came with me to appointments. She always compared me to my younger sister, saying im not strong and independent unlike my little sister. How my little sister never asks for anything yet im so spoiled. Or how my sister was just better than me in general. While my mom was a single mom, I would cook, clean and tutor my sister while my mom was away and she knew that (this was from the ages of 10-15yrs old since when i turned 15 my sister didnt ask for much help anymore) I know she knows that because when shes in a good mood about me she talks to her friends and thats what she says. When we fighr, she always tells me hurtful things like i should just die, or im not a priority, she doesnt care about what happens to me Etc etc.. Then the next minute she's telling me how she loves me unconditionally, only for me to say something she doesnt agree with and the cycle starts again. Shes depended on me for so many things and sometimes it feels hard. I was the one sorting out the documents to send off to the lawyers when she was filing for her divorce, and when she applied for my stepdad's visa, she made me do it for her, and got mad when i couldnt understand anything, calling me dumb and stupid and ""how are you supposed to become a lawyer if you dont even know how to apply for a visa for your stepdad"" keeping in mind I was 15 at the time. My mom and I argue every single day, over small things, but they hurt. She was on a call eith my aunt and i came down to eat some cereal, then she started to call me fat over and over and laughing about it with my aunt. She knows my weight is my biggest insecurity, I tried to tell her later on but she just told me to ""stop being so dramatic"" and ""it was just a joke"" my mom and we don't usually joke to eachother at all. When I turned 18, the first thing she said to me is that ""yay i can finally kick you out!"" as a joke. I guess it is funny, but something inside me just feels sad. Im 18 now and we still argue. I had mock exams this week and yesterday, the teacher who was supervising the students with the exams told me to go home because I was sick. I told my mom and she said ""its probably just stress."" I ended up getting a fever when I got home but she didnt believe me and assumed i just didnt want to sit the exams. She said ""i dont care if you're sick. Deal with it."" ""your health is not my priority"" ""why are you stressed? You're too young to be stressed. Im the one who is stressed. I work day and night!"" She always compares me to her, and my sister. My stepdad, hes a kind person but he always sides with my mom. My mom is the more dominant one in their relationship and my dad just usually sides with her to stay out of trouble. The only support I have is my boyfriend, who i was with for 5 years, but we broke up due to circumstances, but we got back together secretly because my mom now hates him and doesnt want me to get back with him, but ironically she goes around and boasts how she's such a cool mother who gives her children freedom and be with whoever they want. I made my mom believe that I am no londer depressed, anxious, or feeling any sort of sadness or depression. I had to stop helf harming because she would always bring it up in a spiteful way and would call me sick and mentally disturbed.

I feel lonely, and that I have nobody to run to but my current boyfriend and my pet birds. They cant do much, but they've been there for me, my boyfriend and I have been going strong for a while and he's really been a massive help to all of this, but i still feel depressed, messed up and I dont think i can cope anymore... Theres so much more I wish to talk about but I cant remember from the top of my head. Ive tried for so many years to just forget whatever happens and its just all overflowing. Ive attempted suicide a few times in the past which failed. I feel like a failure, i feel useless and unloved by my own mom. I understand she must have insecurities and stress too but does she need to take it out on me? I always feel jealous when i see other kids happy with their parents, while im constantly locked up in my own room, crying and emotionally deteriorating. I dont think I can handle this anymore. I love my mother and i want to make her proud but for years, ive felt like nothing except a burden, a failure and a bad person. She's hardly ever been emotionally supportive and she has hit me in the past. She's one of those ""tiger moms"" the typical asian mom. I've cried to myself to sleep so many times.. i just cant handle it anymore...

I have grown to hate myself, every part of myself. My looks, my personality, traits and even my own feelings. I cant even look in a mirror without feeling disgust. I've tried so hard to stay normal and fine, but im finding it even more difficult as days go by. 

Anyone who read up this far, thank you so much for reading...",19Mar2020,1

My emotions feel so distant like they aren't even there and I cant really put a name to any feeling I really have. If i do feeling anything at all its sadness and demotivated. But I also think that I'd have no problem doing something others would think is hard, but I do have morals. And i know there are consequences but I'm scared consequences are the only thing keeping me from doing something wrong idk.

I'm cutting again, and I'm not proud of it, I hate myself even more but I feel a  bit more relieved I guess. Though I promised I wouldn't to my girlfriend who's been supporting me for 4 years so she understands it.

I just got back from college and its been forever. My weighted blanket feels like her but it doesn't and it makes me sad, relieved, mad, and everything.

It sucks the enjoyment from what I’m doing and makes me want to drink until I sleep. It stops me in my tracks and there is nowhere for it to go. I think mental health is about prolonging the moments it's gone without being addicted to a substance. It’s far easier to drink a bottle of wine than to sit with the pain.

I need/want music recommendations. I have been trying to find new music to listen to (I'm a musician so it is kind of difficult). But for the past few months, music has just not satisfied me like it used to. I haven't played an instrument in weeks, I haven't enjoyed music for months, I haven't done any art projects in weeks, and all of that is just really throwing fuel on the fire. 

I've been living, for at least 15 years, with bipolar disorder, PTSD, gen anxiety disorder, and probably other things I haven't talked to my therapist about. As most of you are aware, any one of those can absolutely ruin interest and drive to enjoy things you love. Music and art are things that my soul absolutely has to have, and my mind is shutting those things out. So I figured maybe if I got some different points of view, and different musical interests, it would eventually spark something and I could get into an incline again. 

So, if you guys are interested, post your favorite music. I wanna explore everyone's faves and see if I can find something that clicks. Thanks in advance, even if it doesn't help me, I know someone will get something from this.",19Mar2020,1

We’ve gone from around the clock contact (we’ve been living apart for a while) to absolutely nothing. His phone is on so he’s alive but no amount of messages will get him to respond. I am not well enough mentally to go there and confront him so I am just left to sit and ponder and it’s killing me. I’m trying to eat, drinking water, taking my meds and attempting to get fresh air but truly inside, I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. He won’t give me closure and I’m guessing his sudden change in recent character is because he knows he’s done something he can’t tell me or I won’t forgive but how on earth do I just pretend he never existed and move on?

Anyone who calls me selfish can fuck off, try watching the man you call your father die in front of you, try being in the kitchen and hearing blood curdling screams that haunt your dreams as your mum finds your dead brother who was sleeping right in the bunk under you. Try living with the guilt that your sisters were being fucked by someone you trusted when they were only fucking 5 years old. Try learning that your older brother got away with a 200 dollar fine and six months good behaviour.

89,"Not sure why. I've gotten episodes like this from time to time in my life, but they usually subside quickly and I always assumed it was normal.

This has been going on since early February. I don't feel really compelled to do much of anything. I'll play a video game for like 20-30 minutes and then I'll put it down and just stop. I don't really feel excited or motivated to go to work either (though I'm sure plenty of people feel this way). Even when I get up and start cleaning the apartment or read a book or put on a TV show I like, I just unexplainably put it down and don't want to do it anymore. 

It's basically affecting my day-to-day. I've been in bed more. I don't know if it's because of lack of human communication (never really had people to generally socialize to begin with or if I did, they seldom wrote back or carried on a convo unless they needed something) or maybe just an accumulation of boring, frustrating, or mentally exhaustive tasks getting the best of me. The back of my head feels heavy sometimes too.",19Mar2020,1

91,"I've seen people talking about it before that this corona virus thing is messing with their mental health. And the response is often ""you're so selfish think about the people that are actually dying wth?!"" or a variation of that.

And I used to think it was whatever but now I totally get it because I once again feel depressed af.

I have less than 3 months to find a job or I'll become homeless, it has been an issue for a while, but good luck finding a job now. Especially considering all the people being let go from their jobs and also the lack of jobs available suddenly, most likely because they don't want to meet with lots of new people for interviews.

I'm sick of not being able to escape it. Getting emails daily for companies, news screens outside, on the radio, weekly texts from relatives telling me don't go outside. I was shamed for chosing to travel within the country and for going to one of the bigger cities for a job interview - basically that I could spread disease to those in the risk group. Got home today and I had a news-paper on my door mat with ""corona-virus"" in big letters on the front.

My friend is unwillingly locked out from her life, to not spread the virus. She does not have the virus but it's to prevent her from getting it and spreading it to someone in the risk group. It's close to illegal that entire thing but its an entire situation I won't discuss but what I'm saying is it's also hard to meet friends and family if you don't already live with them.

I hate being made feel guilty whenever I go outside ? and i hate whenever you show sympathy for anyone else except the people in the risk group risking being sick you're an awful person.

this will go on for months and it's just a hopeless situation and i doubt im the only unemployed person struggling right now. i also doubt im the only one struggling with not knowing when i'll see people that are important to me again.

i don't even have a solution i'm just complaining about a shitty situation. and idk if there's help to get for people struggling in these rough times because you don't even get let in through the door at the health care center unless you answer their questions so idk how much of this is the cause of me never getting an appointment for my mental health",19Mar2020,1
92,"My next therapy appointment isn't for a while and i'm hesitant to talk about this to my therapist. I'm posting here because it's easier to express myself on topics like this when there isn't someone looking back at me. Sometimes I get triggered by something and it feels like my mind regresses in age or I lose sanity in some way. What I mean by this is i'm unable to think straight and tend to rely on my friends a lot more to feel a sense of safety and my thoughts no longer have a filter on them which allows recurrent darker thoughts in. This normally doesn't last longer than an hour so I just accept it as part of who I am and something I can live with but last time it lasted for three days which is way longer than it has ever gone on. This has me really worried with the thought of it happening again but never ending. Thoughts during this mindset tend to revolve around being sexually abused. I tend to find an attraction to the idea of it happening to me and romantic partners that put me through it. A lot of my fantasies line up with what is called Stockholm Syndrome. At the worst parts of this feeling or mindset or whatever it is, I feel that the only useful part of me is my body and that i'd be better if I gave myself to some dark group to be used for sex as it'd be the only way I could be useful. I don't like thinking about any of this really, it gives me a lot of anxiety and sometimes I feel really guilty for some reason for having these thoughts. This is only something that started happening when I got my depression under control, me and my therapist found a lot of it was linked to gender dysphoria which is something I have been taking care of through transitioning. (Genderqueer, Biological Male, Identify as Gay going with any pronouns. I am on estrogen through HRT) I want to be clear that this isn't something caused by the HRT or medicines I have been taking as way before I was able to start this was already happening and is just as bad as it was. I stopped having major depressive symptoms after I stopped pretending to be masculine for my family and friends and started acting like myself, I quickly found out that because I had been actively playing a character for my family and friends that my real feelings and mind didn't have much time to develop. (this went on for 10 years starting at age 6, after my grandmother told me I was too much for her because of my gender problems that I could only express through frustration.) Back on the topic of the dark thoughts, the only ones that are exclusive to that broken mindset is the ones of selling myself as a slave. The attractions and fantasies stay the same outside of it but not as much or as severe.  


Background/potential cause:  
I used to put myself through mental abuse by getting boyfriends that I knew would hurt me, I am unsure why I would do this and can't think of any reasons for it but I always know when I do it.  
I am told I most likely have repressed memories of sexual assault and I feel like its true.  


I am terribly sorry if this is not the place to post this or if i'm doing something wrong, please tell me if I am. Most of what I want out of this is to know if it's okay to be like this or if i'm just a bit odd and tips for self help on this situation. I'd also like tips for how to express this to my therapist, I have been to a mental hospital once before because of the depressive symptoms I had. It was a positive thing to happen, I really was able to help myself and developed coping skills but I have severe PTSD to being sent there and often have nightmares about it. This is one of the reasons i'm scared to talk about all of this face to face with my therapist.

94,"I recently was involuntarily held in a mental hospital last month, for trying to take my own life. Spent a week in there, and it was basically a jail experience. They take away everything, can't even use your phone, you have to follow strict rules, you have to take meds, talk to counselors, you are treated like you can't make your own decisions. If you try to assert your independence, they drag you into an isolation room to punish you. And I didn't even commit a crime. I was just in a bad mental state. I tried to assert my rights and it just blew up in my face. Why are mental hospitals like this?",19Mar2020,1
95,"So I’ve recently started going through the mental health system in the U.K. for suspected PTSD due to childhood trauma. I’ve been hospitalised 4 times in less than a year due to very extreme anxiety reactions (stroke-like symptoms, loss of speech, heavy ataxia, among more symptoms) the worst episode of which took me a month to start speaking normally again. 

My most recent visit resulted in me being given a short term Diazepam prescription (incredibly rare for the U.K. from what I have seen) and have been referred to the Psychiatric Nurse.

At my initial assessment we discussed if I was on any medication and explained my GP had taken me off all antidepressants due to them being ineffective and the side effects being too restricting on my life, also my GP wants to treat my mental health as trauma-induced anxiety rather than treating depression as the primary issue. Now when we discussed Diazepam, the nurse basically said he wants me to see the resident psychiatrist about being on some kind of medication as he doesn’t feel it safe for me to be completely unmedicated but iterated that diazepam, although extremely effective at controlling my symptoms and episodes, is not available for long term prescription. He did say however that the psychiatrist can prescribe “something that is similar but isn’t as addictive”.

I like to think my pharmaceutical knowledge is pretty decent, but I have been wracking my brain trying to work out what medication this could possibly be. Beta blockers, SSRI/SNRI, TCA and TeCAs have all been ruled out as ineffective, so has anyone else been through the U.K. psychiatric teams and may be able to shed light on what they’re likely to prescribe? I can’t think of any drug that works like benzodiazepines do in regards to anxiety.

I've kinda been threatened with being written up because I can't seem to do anything they ask of me right. My anxiety doesn't help because it makes me really panicky.

99,"20M here and there are alot of things that aren't working out in my life, to keep this really short and simple; I have anger issues, like real bad one where I blackout and break things. This has being going on for a long time, since childhood I was a destructive kid with a bad temper.

I had a really nice and loving childhood but when I get upset or mad, I just loose it, I yell, I break stuff, punch the walls till my knuckles bleed etc.
When I get mad, I want to break something or someone, I don't get the satisfaction by meditation at all but instead it fuels me up even more.

Since I started dating this girl things have been going downhill, I've been someone I never thought I would become, I am ashamed of myself to say this but this is the only place where people would understand.
So the relationship was bad from the start,I loved her dearly but she cheated (long story) I forgave her but I was still pretty mad about it.

So I had her Instagram account without her knowing and saw that she was lying to me again, in a fit of rage I hit her twice but I regret that. I never wanted to hit a women but now I've crossed that line, I even threatened and blackmail her that I'll leak her nudes etc. 
  
(Ik this sounds really really bad but this is not me, I'm not in control when I'm mad, I blackout)

Today I was in an argument with her, I snapped and I broke my 10k piano and broke the baseball bat itself, my face was red like blood from the anger and to scare my girlfriend, I grabbed my dog and put a knife on it's throat and told my girlfriend to apologize otherwise I'll slit my dogs throat.

Then it suddenly hit me with what the fuck I am doing? What have I become in past few months, I threw the knife away and sat down and reflected about the things  I could've done. I love my dog to death but at that moment, it wasn't me. 

Idk what treatment I should get, it feels like a curse and I bet one day I'll end up killing somebody.

Ik I am a piece of shit and deserve to be behind bars and I'll readily do my time if I feel I've started to become dangerous. I wanna know the root cause of this? Why am I defective? Why cant I live a normal life? Why do I get this murderous rage?

101,"I believe the short and sharp answer of addressing nativity is being a bit dumb in all honesty. 

I'm a 26 year old man that has struggled with very poor mental health issues my whole life and have witnessed more generational emotional and physical trauma than most people I've come across. Through adulthood I have heavily consumed alcohol and drugs to better my positive emotional state when it rarely comes across. This cycle usually leads to going too hard and end up in some of the worst mental states of my life. These cycles correlate closely with nativity because at times I have always questioned myself with decision making and feel at times I have lost connection with reality and almost always seek other opinions because I can't understand why close people around me would lie and want to see me hurt. At times I do the same and can identify the hypocrisy that is present and feel ashamed. Since the age of 18 I have always had issues with relationships and women because I witnessed regular domestic violence towards my Mother and feel the need over compensate and pledge myself to a partner. My understanding of women in relationships has grown into a truly murky perception and feel that extravagant efforts to be happy and keep the peace is dramatically artificial and delusional at times. I have a fear of getting hurt and can plot ridiculous thoughts of infidelity amongst friends and past partners. I have spent many times in my life blocking out volatile and truth based insults because I can't handle the ongoing pain in my life. At times I will literally pretend to turn off my hearing and zone out to try combat these certain situations. I am at stage where I am not entirely sure if I'm hearing what I want to hear, what I don't want to or having no idea how to operate. A lot of of my problems have been underlining since a child but definetly have to take blame for heightening these issues with the use of alcohol and drugs. Through ageing I have tried to cease nativity and try assess problems without focusing on the hurt involved. A large part of my confidence to combat difficult situations is pondered on whilst under the influence of alcohol and drugs and eventually poorly acted on. I have improved my life slowly but tend to ruin any good work made by abusing substances because the feeling of happiness is illusive and I feel it needs to be bolstered. As I am writing this, I have been awake for 3 days drinking ridiculous amounts of alcohol and indulging in drugs. 

I commonly live a life of ruminating impulsive good and depressing thoughts and try persisting to be a good person but have always ended up lost. I have observed how my family and friends acknowledge me differently in certain situations and find it hard to accept but have to keep moving in a forward direction. I believe I am naive but sincerely don't know what to believe in at the best of times because I don't know how to make my own decisions in tricky situations.",19Mar2020,1
102,"Hey all, I know that a lot of people are struggling right now, these are hard times.

For me I think the most difficult thing is that I'm away from my husband. I have been waiting for my spouse UK spouse visa from within the US for two months now. It's due to come back within the next two weeks but with every single day, the situation gets worse and worse.

When the outbreak became more of a reality for the rest of the world, I was calm. I'm staying with my parents and my mom was glued to the news from the beginning - which, we all know, even in this time of real crisis, *is sensationalized.* I took to finding my own news sources and searching around online to sort of triangulating my away to the appropriate level of concern for this problem. On a personal level, while I'm nervous, I'm not entirely concerned for myself... or.. wasn't... we'll get to that in a moment. I'm 24, healthy, and fit, with no compromising medical conditions so my fear isn't really for myself but more for my parents (who I still think will be ok) and others who are at higher risk. 

While I've already been away from my husband for a while I was initially thinking that it might be wise to postpone my visa and apply for a later date of entry and ride this out at my parents' house in the US. They live in the suburbs, we have space to ourselves, we have a yard and the woods, and cars... it's pretty ideal. Whereas my husband and I have an apartment together in London... not ideal during a pandemic. 

It was when the travel bans were first imposed that I started to get really nervous. When the US banned a large chunk of Europe from entry I began the conversation with my husband about having him come to the US. His office had already asked everyone to work from home so it was something that wouldn't be difficult to transfer here. My reasons were that the UK was definitely going to be banned next (which we see it now has been) and that even though they have a set number of days the situation is unfolding rapidly and we don't know what's going to happen next or if our options will be limited. I can't travel at this time as my passport is being sent back to me with my visa paperwork.

My husband wasn't as concerned as I was about the situation. I am probably overreacting, but he's under-reacting. His under-reaction causes me to overreact even more. His reasons for not wanting to come to the US were mainly based on personal comfort, not wanting to wake up several hours early for work, not wanting to leave the apartment, etc. He didn't even want to go to his parent's house in the country for some of these reasons. He really wasn't looking at the big picture.

When the UK was banned I lost it. I was upset that he didn't even believe that it was going to happen. In fact, from the beginning, he didn't believe that this would be as bad as it is and didn't even think his office would close. The situation continues to prove its self as being worse and worse, proving my speculations to be right again and again, and his lack of concern and unwillingness to trust my predictions is only stressing me out more. 

*\[it turns out there is an exemption for spouses to enter the US at this time, which I only just found the clause for... so this may still be a possibility... however.....\]*

We got past the initial concern over this and decided to wait it out and see what happens with my visa... but I feel like we're getting to the point where we really need to consider our options for what to do and what we *can* do if my visa is canceled or if I can't travel.

He doesn't want to speculate, but I'm trying to explain that these 'what-ifs' are very real and is not like saying ""what if one hundred African rhinos stampede and trample me in the suburbs of North America""...... it's on the level of ""what if I get in a car accident, maybe I should have medical and car insurance."" But right now, with him, with the world, and even with my parents it seems like to people, any speculation is just as unprobable or not worth thinking about as the worst and most unlikely speculations that can possibly be made. I think that's denial. I think that there *are* steps that we can take to reduce the risk to ourselves and ensure that we can get to each other before anything gets worse. But nobody wants to hear it and just wants to 'wait and see'.

My husband has been working from home for a week now. Generally taking things more seriously and when we've spoken he has been significantly more concerned than we was initially... even urging some of his friends who want to get together that this isn't the time and that they need to be more careful. He's expressed that he feels like work is so unimportant compared to what's happening and that it's hard to focus on his projects due to the chaos. However this is all pretty selective for him because today he somehow rationalized going to his co-worker's house to do work together for the day. 

London is being put on lockdown tomorrow. This is where I panicked. While they're saying they aren't imposing travel bans but I worry that they totally could, it's a real possibility, but that if they said so everyone would scatter and leave the city if they could, causing more spread of the virus the way we've seen with every other city and region that has imposed some sort of widespread lockdown.  

I told him that he needs to leave, and go to his parents ASAP. That even if I do get my visa and can travel, if he's locked down in London I won't be able to get to him for what could be months. While I adore his parents I couldn't leave mine, travel halfway around the world during this, and not be able to see him at all. While it hasn't happened yet, it is a *real* possibility. Even though we're young and healthy, if he did need medical care, London is going to be the absolute last place that you want to be during a global pandemic where people aren't going to be able to get the care they need. Either he wouldn't get care or he'd take the care away from someone elderly who needs it because he's young and has a future. He's already expressed that there isn't much food in our local shop - that is only going to get worse. Even if I can't make it to him at all through this, I want him to be safe and not alone during this. I want to have all of the chances that we can to get back to each other and being in a city will severely limit those options. Even the city that my parents live near is heading towards Shelter in Place measures... this strictness won't reach us because we're far enough into the country that such measures won't mean the same things for us, we can still go out to our yard. That's the difference. 

He was annoyed that I called him while he was 'working' and 'at his coworker's house', where he shouldn't have been anyway, and asked if we could talk later. NO. We cannot talk later because this is an *emergency.* He said so himself, this situation is so much bigger than work. He held on to all of these reasons to stay through this in London, in the flat, including not wanting our plants to die. I don't want him to get stuck in London alone just to keep the plants alive... like what on earth are you thinking.

I know that everyone is trying to cope in different ways and hold on to some semblance of normalcy and look for the things that affirm the illusion that daily life could still be going on but that isn't an option anymore. This mindset honestly makes me panic 20 times more. 

I think the biggest thing for me, and this is where personal physical health comes into this, is that the stress over this is going to deteriorate our health. His health. My health. Making us more subject to illness. Being apart and not having the comfort of your spouse during this time is probably some of the worst pain I've ever felt. With the addition of the worry of him being unsafe, alone, without food, in locked-down London. I honestly can't even live day to day worrying about that. 

I've been doing everything that I can to stay calm. The only place where I find some kind of peace is through doing yoga... but only while I'm doing it... I can't sleep. I have no desire to eat. 

My mother and I don't particularly get along so she has been spectacularly unhelpful throughout this whole thing. Instead of siding with me, or even just supporting me, she tries to play devil's advocate, vastly undermines my relationship and makes no effort to empathize with what I'm going through, and then tells me everything that *I'm* doing wrong. It's hard to understand quite what this feels like if you aren't dealing with it right now.

While I'm trying to stay calm, trying to practice self care, trying to stay strong for my husband and continuing to assure him and myself that we'll be ok... it's things like that that I feel can promote putting our heads in the sand and not taking action when action can and needs to be taken. Because this news has been unfolding over a course of several months I feel like it has gotten to a place that, while there's anxiety, it has also been normalized. Almost always the things that we fear happening are not as bad when we're actually in them, or the way that we imagine them to feel versus what they actually feel like are different. We have slowly eased into this. Because there as no sudden order for a global grinding halt, we haven't panicked. We're 'waiting and seeing' because largely, there isn't a lot we can do... but making moves like getting out of a city that's on the verge of lockdown and being overwhelmed medically... is the right thing to do.

So I'm going through this roller coaster of trying to stay calm, reaching a level of calm, learning a new piece of information and having my anxiety pitch through the roof, urging people that I love to take the actions that they *can,* while they can, having my concern invalidated or undermined, and then reaching a new peak of anxiety due to feeling utterly helpless, wondering who's right and who's wrong, what the appropriate level of concern is, if we can take personal actions, should we, and trying to convince people to do so rather than sticking their heads in the sand. 

My husband finally agreed to leave the city after I asked him why the hell he was hanging on to staying there when the list of potential risks were stacked so high against him versus the benefits of him staying with his parents... and that, sorry you're working right now but work can wait, there will always be other work, but family and safety is here and now and what I think is the number one priority, forgive me if I'm wrong.

This situation is torture. Especially with my mother who doesn't care and my father who is too overwhelmed to offer support or talk with me about it. I feel crazy but I also feel like if we don't do something, we might lose our options to. I'm torn between following all of the advice to stay calm and focus on myself and distractions versus my actual gut feeling and anxiety that this could be worse for us than we think if we let it go for too long (in terms of our personal lives and getting to the people that we need to). 

What do I even do? How do I get through something like this..",19Mar2020,1

Maybe a community focused on talking about activities that we still can do during this time and just overall support so that maybe less people lose their minds stuck alone at home, with toxic family when back from college, stuck taking care of children and feeling inferior for not being able to entertain them, etc.?",19Mar2020,1

108,"I think I am a sociopath.

I’ve never been diagnosed, no. To begin I consider myself a very like-able person, very charismatic and attractive. I’d never say that to you in person because that feels like I’m just bragging, but this is anonymous so I don’t care. I’ve never had problems getting along with people, and can talk to essentially anyone very well. I’m well spoken, usually judging by someone’s appearance I’ll even throw on a different persona if they’re a stranger and speak in terms that seem relevant to them, or about things that appeal to them. Every relationship I’ve ever had I’ve broken the woman. I’ve caused them to lose all of their friends, lose bonds with family, and worse. Unintentionally of course, but I can’t say I don’t find pleasure in being able to control things like that. When I can’t control things in their life, I get furious. I lash out a lot and say many hurtful things in fits of rage, which are usually short lived. Afterwards, I can see that I’ve hurt the person, but I don’t feel any remorse usually. It sounds bad, but I don’t realize it until I think back on it. I’ve never been broken up with, I think if I had I’d lose my mind, I’ve never said I love you first, and I’m not sure if I ever will. Every time a woman has told me they love me, it’s been within the first month of talking, usually within the first week. I always say it back of course, even if I don’t feel it because I want to keep their interests and make them feel special. The list goes on, and if you have any questions feel free to ask.

Can anyone confirm my suspicions? I think I could be a sociopath.",19Mar2020,1
109,"Hey all! I live in America, and have been struggling to find a therapist. I have a super weird work schedule, insurance that basically nobody takes (as is wildly too expensive), and now I’m stuck in my house on quarantine. I have severe anxiety, which comes with some DPDR and depression. And with my work being cancelled and me being stuck in the house, everything is worse!

I’ve tried a multitude of pills, and I’m actually on Duloxetine right now. It doesn’t seem to help much, and I’ll be seeing my psychologist soon about alternatives. I have my medical marijuana card, which works wonders for me, but is more of a bandaid. I think the one thing that’s really going to help me, is a therapist. 

But with everything going on, what should I do with therapy? I know about online therapy, but what’s the effectiveness of it? What about books and other self help aspects? Is it worth it to brave social contact to do in person? What’s the best way to get help with everything going on? What’s worked for you?",19Mar2020,1

I have things I could do, probably things that would be beneficial for me, like cleaning off my desk, and writing a letter to my friend who is in boot camp. I have laundry I need to fold, I have more I need to wash. I could read a book I suppose. Any ideas for tiny reward chemicals I can give myself? Lol.

111,"I used to be somewhat overweight up until three years ago when I was able to go back to a healthy BMI. Growing up I was always told how important it is to not be overweight in order to be well accepted into society. This made me feel very self conscious and that ‘I am not worth people’s time’.  My boyfriend recently told me that I am ‘the limit to what he would date in terms of body size’ which has kind of brought back old insecurities. He tells me he loves me but I have this irrational fear that he will find someone who is ‘prettier’ than me and that he would never want to marry someone like me who’s not ‘perfect’. I know this is total nonsense but I am always having those irrational thoughts. I also feel inferior to anyone who is skinnier than me.

But with the pandemic happening, the fact that my country will most likely face an economic collapse and the possibility of my mother dying to the virus ( the only person I still try to live for) is putting me in a state of a continuous low profile mental breakdown.

Crying over how much I've missed out on in my life. Over how many opportunities I've squandered. Over how I wasted my potential. Over how I can't break this cycle. And even if I do I cry over my past mistakes and regrets.

Dropping out of high school

Isolating self from everyone and never developing social skills.

Not knowing who my friends and family actually are.

Never developing relationship skills or ever being in a relationship with someone.

Never living my life. Just existing.

Never realizing my potential.

Letting life happen to me.

Never developing myself.

Never exploring what life has to offer.

Letting fear, insecurity, and anxiety live my life for me.

Being a coward and not taking action and working for what I want.

Fuck I wish I had a reset button.

Not having an idea of WHO I AM. I don't even know who I am anymore. I don't know what I like or dislike. I don't know my values. I don't know what I want from life truly. I don't have opinions of my own. I have no drive. No ambition. No skills. No talents. I'm like a robot that just woke up finally from a 19 year coma and became a human. But the tragic comedy of it is that I have to move forward and live with the fact that I wasted all this time and I'll be playing catch up for the rest of my life. I wish I could just forget my past and move forward, but it's my past who made me who I am today. I feel fucked beyond repair. I wish I could just change all this but it seems so unrealistic. Like me? Yeah fucking right. You'll never live a happy life. A life you dream of. No no you're just too fucking stupid. 

I just function on habits only anymore. I realize when I do something out of habit though. And I beat myself up over it for not being able to control myself. Is there something wrong with my brain? All I can truly say I know about myself is that I exist and that's it. I don't know I'm just kind of terrified from the realization that I'm so fucking lost. Will I ever know who I am? Or am I too far gone in the sense that I polluted my mind or something with others thoughts and ideas or fear/anxiety and never developed a sense of self? I can fake being someone but WHO AM I REALLY?

I want to stop wasting my life and do something with it but how can I change all this if I don't even know myself or what I want or where to start?

Even when simple things happen like when i drop something i get so mad. Even now.. nothing has happened and yet im so angry!  Im frustrated and sad at the same time. It feels like when you havent slept for a long time, you get irritated and sad quickly (atleast for me).

I dont have sleeping issues, on the contruary i sleep great.

Right now my brother watching tv and im so annoyed by the sound. Cant he fking turn the volume down to 0?! Why does he have to be so noisy. The volume isnt high but i just dont want to hear it. Even his presence bothers me. Why cant he just go play outside or something?!

Im irritated by everything. I am 17 years old  and sometimes i wonder why am i even alive. Idc that i dont have reasons to feel this way. I dont care if people miss me if i kill myself. After all its just a world i was placed in which i should be able to leave just as easily. I just hate it all. Everything. Then there are other times when i think, ""how could i ever wondered why im alive? I am going show everyone around me whos boss. I will write my own story and make so many people smile!""

But right now i hate it all. Im angry and i keep brushing my parents and friends off, and my parents they get mad at me. Earlier, i wouldve just gotten into a fight with them simply because i get irritated so badly I CANT STAND IT. Right now i dont even care. So what if theyre angry at me. I dont care anymore. So i just say ""ok"" and they have the last word and then the fight is over.

Sometimes when i walk in a hallway in school, towards my class, the people that walk in front of me annoy me so badly. On that moment it makes me want to choke them. I then imagine me choking them. I know i shouldnt think this badly and i would never really choke them to death, because i do not lack common sense. But i cant help wanting to choke them out of anger.
 On other days on school its the complete opposite. Whenever i see my friends i just have to smile sponatiously because im so happy to see them. 

I think that there might be something wrong with me. Maybe its in my brains or maybe im a psychopath. Somoene else told me that im just ""too spoiled"". Well, i dont get treated very bad but i wouldnt call myself spoiled. 

Please help i dont know what to do anymore. Im so scared to tell anyone. I tried telling my parents but they told me that i was trying to avoid the real problem/ that it wasnt the problem at all. The ""real problem"" was that im just in puberty and that i just lack respect towards others. But theyve been telling me that for 5 years now. Its getting worse.

118,"It has left a lasting impact that still causes me problems almost 10 years later. I’ve never been able to tell anyone because I feel so much shame. I’m a male too and i woke up and couldn’t move i was in so much pain. They held me down. I don’t know what to do because it’s to the point where I can’t live with the guilt. This isn’t how things were supposed to be. Most days i just feel hopeless and idk if this has contributed to it in addition to a history of mental illness. I’ve had numerous head traumas. I abused drugs for about a year or so very heavily to suppress all of my feelings before i decided to clean up a little and act like things were fine. I just don’t know what to do and struggle to keep going. I see no value in life. A typical four year degree has taken me nearly 8 years due too all my time off and medical withdrawal.

119,"I dont know where to post this so I'll do it here

I partly know the answer to this, but theres something I don't understand.
First of all, I tend to seek out dark things whenever I am in a bad state (which is quite often since my life feels like hell) I think this might be a way of coping or expressing my feelings. Dark things make me feel more numb to all those negative thoughts, sometimes a bit happy and relieved, like dark humour.
Theres stuff like murder, which gives me thrill and a sense of excitement, I like stuff like dark music and art and stories sometimes because I like analysing things too.
But then there are things or stories  which just make me feel like shit and ruin me, for example, certain stories of abuse (it's vague because it seems to be and feels kinda random, I can't remember what specifically, just that it happens and the feeling of it). It makes me scared and paranoid yet I cant stop, there are no positives, it destroys me. There are other topics too which have the same result. 
Often times there's things much, much worse that I can watch without batting an eye, but then I can't handle other things.
It's just so much confusion. I feel so close yet so far, My life seems normal outside and no big changes have happend, I think. There are a lot of things I cant remember (how and when it started, what makes me feel this way) so I'm sorry for that, I just want answers, I cant do anything so I just want to know answers.
I dont think I'm squeamish or anything because, as I mentioned before, I'm fine with things much worse, sometimes they make me feel less worse

It just seems like I'm going through so much and my mind won't step in to protect itself? I should be happy that it isn't too much, right? The thing is, I feel like I'm at my breaking point. It's too much and my mind just won't step in. Does that mean that it's not as bad as it feels for me? Or that my mind is strong, which is something I should celebrate? 

It's just so much. I think about how regular people don't have to have plans A-Z just to get through the day without breaking down. And I wasn't always like this. I used to be a happy kid.

And the last time I posted on this sub during a bad day, it made it easier, so maybe it'll help again. For context, I'm living at home as I'm just 16. 

I was sitting in the dinner table with my family, which in itself is rare.  But I realized, that I was the only one who is at a healthy weight. My father is only slightly overweight, but my mother is obese. 200 pounds, minimum. At just 5'2. My brothers are both overweight. Nobody in my family exercises or eats healthy. 

I am the skinny one. And by skinny I mean I'm normal. (5'8, 145 lbs). But still I feel like shit. I'm all skin, bones and fat. There's no muscle, I can't even do a single push up. Less than 15 sit ups. Only thing I can do well is squats. I walk my dog at least three times a day, so during the day I walk about 10 000 steps. But I'm not happy. My body is still disgusting. I have gained 15 pounds in less than a year. I have no control over what I eat or how much. It's the idea of ""Be thankful that you even have food. There are people starving.""  I'm not ungrateful for it. But I eat way too much. No fruits or vegetables at all. Food my parents cook is always quick, full of carbs and fat. Not nearly enough protein, way too much sugar. And a daily multivitamin won't do it.

All this has made me so disgusted of my own body. I don't want to see myself in the mirror. It's way too fat, jiggly and disgusting. I have scars from multiple eczemas from when I was a kid. I'm always finding new bruises, and not even remembering where or why I got them. My skin is covered in acne, that has spread from my face to my back, chest and upper arms. I can't change my body. If I was to start working out, I would immediately be suspected for having an eating disorder. I understand their worry, as few years back I avoided food at all costs, and worked out to be perfect. But now I just want to be healthy and pretty. I absolutely hate my body, it's just a sign of unhealthy habits. 

I get so many mixed signals from my mom. Either I get ""Why are you eating that"", ""do you really need that"", ""Oh wow somebody is hungry"" or ""That's alot of food, you know?"", ""When I was your age, I was so much lighter than you, but also had bigger boobs"", followed by ""Why are you eating so little?"", ""Eat a bit more!"", ""Omg your wrist is so small, I can put my fingers around it!"" . In a few weeks. It really messes with my head, I don't know what she wants me to be. My body is never good enough, my acne is always ""so bad"" and ""she feels sorry for me"".  Has been for years. I remember getting those comments ever since I was five. I remember being 7, looking in the mirror and just looking at my body, thinking how chubby I was. How bad I looked. I still do. I'm waiting for the day I move out. I could finally have a good body. I can change what I eat and how I work out. 

But at the moment, I just want to rip my body. I want to have a strong, healthy body. But now I'm just so disgustingly fat and unhealthy, with nothing I can do. I just eat what I'm given. If I try to resist and only eat when I'm hungry, my mother forces me to binge with her. I want to break myself into perfection, I want to break every mirror in the house. The way my body looks disgusts me. I can't find a single thing I like about it. I don't want to see myself in the mirror, but still I look at myself everyday, all day. I look at all my flaws that I could change. I want to have a perfect body, maybe then I could get somebody to love me.  It sounds so pathetic, and because I'm young this will just be put on hormones. It might be, but I can't find where the line goes. I truly believe that I could get someone to love me and have a relationship with if my body was more fit. I'd be so pretty, and so much happier.

129,"While living in NY, there were these silent disco things that I'd witness a lot. What are they?

A **silent disco** is an event where you put on a special pair of noise-canceling headphones and gather with others who have done the same. Then, as individuals, you can tune into one or multiple channels of sound, while simultaneously and indirectly combining energies with those around you.

People need to move a little bit and feel good while still have a sense of belonging. Syncing music is tough with connection and everything.

130,"My ex broke up with me 16 days ago, 10 days later he started flirting and messing around with one of my friends from uni. We were 4 years together, had an entire future planned out but due to several hard previous months he just couldn't take it anymore and broke up with me. I'm entirely devastated. I love him with my entire being and picturing them together drove me to self harm.
I constantly compare myself with her... at first I was wondering what she had that I didn't, then I stopped that and started regretting all the times he gave me hints that something wasn't right and I brushed it off cause I was too self absorbed in my own issues. She was there when I wasn't and that revelation hurts more than anything.  
I recently lost appetite; I eat once a day just so my mother wouldn't be as worried... I do feel hunger, but every time I think about eating I get nauseated...

I will be 31 this year and I'm just so tired. Women simply don't like me. I'm a decent looking guy its just that my personality is just meek and weird even if I try to act confident and they just don't like me and everything I do feels like a cope.

133,"My grandma raised me for three years (between the ages of 3-6) in Taiwan when my parents couldn't care for me, and in early 2018, my entire family save for my grandmother disowned me. She is basically my only family now. My grandma is in Taiwan and I'm a 21 year old college student in the US. 8 months ago, my grandma was given 6 more months to live due to her medical conditions. Initially the plan was that once she began to decline, I would drop everything (work, school, etc) and immediately fly to her to be with her until the end. Obviously, that isn't going to happen now. I am a Taiwanese citizen, but I can't go to Taiwan because she won't be there anymore at the end of the mandatory 14 day quarantine.

137,"First, this post isn’t meant to be insensitive, or shame anybody. Second, everybody’s circumstances are different, this is just my situation. 

I’ve been working through depression, anxiety, and a sense of hopelessness for many years.  I saw a therapist on a weekly basis, for a while.

However, since the pandemic crisis started in the US and I started telecommuting last week, I’ve actually been feeling much better mentally.  

Since the stress of my work commute and dealing with a toxic office culture (and toxic colleagues) has been eliminated, I’ve been getting a solid eight hours of sleep every night, I’ve quit smoking, I’ve started jogging and/or exercising everyday, I’m spending quality time with my spouse and dog, and I’m still finding time to get all my work done.  

Oddly enough, I’ve found a certain life balance this last week that I’m liking a lot, despite the fact that the outside world seems to be in free fall. Anybody else feel this way? 

Granted, unlike many other people right now, I have job security, a steady income, and a generally reliable means of getting supplies for the long haul. In that regard I feel very blessed.  If anything, the only things worrying me are the physical and mental health of my extended family, friends, and spouse - but thankfully, they all seem to be doing well too.

Maybe my depression and anxiety stem from a certain kind of agoraphobia or social anxiety I didn’t even realize I had, and this new situation, where I’m actually required to stay home or otherwise be alone, is the sort of “medicine” I needed.

141,"Today I opened my first reddit account only for the sole purpose of sharing my sorrow and how things are killing me from inside. I am a 22 year old female. I have had an extremely rough childhood with a lot of alcohol and violence. Our house smelled like alcohol all the time and it was putrid and atrocious. I have always been an average student in school because I used to emotionally and physically drained by all the chaos at home. Everyday. However, I had my mother's support and she was aware of my condition and she was infact proud of me that I could make it up to this much. But that didn't stop me from getting bullied and insulted by teachers and relatives.
I grew up, overweight and not so pleasant to look at. As a teen, I faced a lot of bullying by my cousins and classmates made fun of me all the time about my appearence and for how socially inept and abnormally quiet I was.

As if these were not enough for a 13 year old girl to bear, that one night I got wrongly touched by my drunk father as I was trying to fall asleep on my bed. I was frozen and could move a muscle as he kept going on with his disgusting activities. Out of embarrassment and out of the fear, I pretended to be asleep. Before this incident took place, there had been other instances where his hands would go on my chest and waist on several occassions but I neglected them and thought they were ""mistakes"". Ofcourse I was young and foolish. Sure my father is alcoholic and throw tantrums at my mother but the idea of a father molesting her very own child was beyond me at that age.

Nothing much is left to say after this. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, PTSD, manic depression, acute misophonia and misokinesia. Regarding misophonia and misokinesia, I particularly get furious at certain sounds and movements that my father make because my trauma is rooted from him and then it spiked towards my brother as well. My case is acute and I get extremely violent by those triggers. So anyway, as I am growing older, these horrors are getting more embedded with me and I am afraid that it will drive me insane one day. I get nervous breakdowns out of nowhere. My sex life with my boyfriend is at stake because everytime I let him touch my body, I get traumatic flashbacks and then I am unable to continue with it. I can't explain him why. I am sensitive about this past of my and fear that he wouldn't understand. My mental condition is aggravating and it is affecting my daily activities. I have also attempted suicide 2 years back and now I don't even have the courage to do that. I just feel trapped inside an unwanted body and emotionally drained. Moreover, I love my mother so much. She has sacrificed a lot for me and I dread to inflict such torture on her. I am in so much pain right now and I don't know what to do. Will I ever be able to pursue my career or anything at all? Will I ever be healed? I don't know.",19Mar2020,2
142,"Once again, I have felt compelled to write about mental health, basing what I write on my own experiences in dealing with OCD and anxiety. This topic is especially prevalent now that the COVID-19 pandemic has reached America, causing Americans to feel more anxious on a day-to-day basis. This means that those who have preexisting issues with anxiety are now in double trouble, and that those who do not have preexisting issues are now facing a new monster in anxiety. So, what should people do?

1.  Face it:

When it comes to dealing with anxiety, one of the worst things a person can do is deny that it is an issue. Anxiety, like many other mental issues, feeds off of one’s denial. Denial allows anxiety to sneak into the psyche and nest there without a person even realizing it. This is why it is so imperative to face the beast that is anxiety. If one spends their time denying its existence or worrying about when their next panic attack is going to come, the affect will be much worse than if one confronts it. Confronting anxiety can take many forms, and since I am not a doctor I will not even attempt to prescribe a specific solution, especially since there seems to be no universal fix. However, by confronting it one can learn how to draw on the energy of anxiety. Anxiety is not an inherently bad thing. It can drive people to study, start projects, or do many other necessary activities. By facing your anxiety and learning how to draw on its energy, you may not only rid yourself of the issues that result from an anxiety disorder, but also make yourself a more active person. Confront your anxiety and find your solution.

2.  Fight:

Have you ever read the Hobbit? In this book the main character, Bilbo, travels across his world in order to find an ancient treasure. When he comes to the cave where the treasure is hidden, there is an evil dragon that is guarding the treasure and Bilbo and his companions must face and fight the dragon in order to get the treasure. Why is this relevant to the topic of anxiety? Just like the dragon, anxiety can be a monster. However, beneath it is the treasure of peace. But you can never get the treasure without fighting the monster. Often times people think that dealing with their anxiety will be a matter of simply relaxing or going to counseling or getting medicated. This is incorrect. You have to literally fight it. As with all good things in life, you must struggle to attain them, just like Bilbo had to struggle against the dragon. Once you face it and fight it you will discover that it is not a great beast, but merely a hallow reflection of one. You must fight the monster in order to get the treasure.

3.  Socialize:

Although we are being told to socially isolate ourselves, it is extremely important to keep in touch with friends and family. Just like when one avoids anxiety, isolating oneself causes the effects of anxiety to feel much worse. Going back to the analogy of the Hobbit, Bilbo did not face and fight the dragon alone. He had help from friends, and a magic ring, and although this sounds silly it is immensely important. No one can fight a monster alone. Everyone needs help and no one should feel ashamed of needing help. In fact, the shame that stems from feeling like you need help is actually a by-product of anxiety because it knows that once you get help, its days are numbered. It will try to tell you that you are weak or that people will think you are strange. It is lying. Socialize with people so that you do not have to face the monster yourself.

4.  Find an anchor:

As I am sure everyone knows, ships have anchors so that they can maintain their position when waves are attempting to move it. Anxiety is much like these waves. It will try to move you out of reality and into its delusional and chaotic world. This is why one suffering from anxiety must find some kind of anchor in reality. For me, it was my parents. When I dealt with anxiety I knew that if I was ever straying too far from reality that I could be brought back down to earth by calling my parents who would remind me of exactly what it was the anxiety was trying to do, which was take away my sense and create chaos. One must find their own anchor, but whatever it is make sure that it is steady and strong and truthful. 

 In closing, I would like to say that in no way, shape, or form am I an expert on this topic. Everything I have written today is based on my own experience or on books and articles I have read (most of which have been written by Jordan Petersen, Robert Moore, or Carl Jung). Everyone must do their own research on this topic. There is no universal fix to anxiety, and people must find what works for them as at the end of the day they are the ones who must ultimately face it. But remember, while it may seem like anxiety is a great big beast, it is actually a hallow reflection of one, and you as well as your support system are much stronger than anxiety could ever be.

144,"Disclaimer - I understand that the only person who can diagnose you with a mental illness is a mental health care professional. I’m purely wondering what illnesses to look into to help narrow out wildly inaccurate ones. 

I am a 17 year old female. My family life is fine, in fact, I cause most of the trouble. I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, but it doesn’t quite explain everything. I also have an anxiety disorder and depression.

Im prone to extreme bouts of anger. As in, threatening murder, throwing things, screaming. It’s basically a toddler tantrum but more violent. It’s triggered by the smallest things. (ex. my sister dried out my makeup wipes and i broke down for hours.) I initially got upset over the makeup wipes, leading to wildly irrational thoughts and contemplating my life as a whole. 

I suffer from a lot of intrusive thoughts. These can go anywhere from “you could just start making monkey noises in the middle of the grocery store, what can anyone do about it?” to “your entire family could die in an accident leaving you helpless.” They effect the quality of my life tremendously. 

Im extremely codependent, as well as having an intense fear of abandonment. Anyone who has ever “left me” I have become obsessed with mentally. Sometimes I try to emulate them, other times I just social media stalk them a little too extensively. I don’t ever try to contact these people, just that. 

I often dissociate , or have moments of derealization. Sometimes it happens at the same time and I genuinely feel like nothing is real. 

I have an extremely unorganized headspace, and I feel like I have too many thoughts. I can often be going on 3 rants simultaneously that can last HOURS, trying to think my concious thoughts, while also having intrusive thoughts, while also thinking about the future and past at the exact same time. Its complete cacophony inside my head, almost constantly. All of the “voices” are my own. 

I also have trouble empathizing, but its not impossible. Just hard. 

Ive written a novel here, so hopefully this gives some insight, but I would be so appreciative if anyone could point me in the right direction.",19Mar2020,1

7. Substances which will enhance the ability of individuals to withstand privation, torture and coercion during interrogation and so-called “brain-washing”.

8. Materials and physical methods which will produce amnesia for events preceding and during their use.

9. Physical methods of producing shock and confusion over extended periods of time and capable of surreptitious use.

10. Substances which produce physical disablement such as paralysis of the legs, acute anemia, etc.

11. Substances which will produce “pure” euphoria with no subsequent let-down.

12. Substances which alter personality structure in such a way that the tendency of the recipient to become dependent upon another person is enhanced.

Ok so I’m a 17 year old bisexual male and I dated a guy in the summer, who I was really in love with. He showed me A LOT of attention which was rly new to me considering my past girlfriends haven’t rly cared for me in the same way. 

I feel like that attention all kind of went to my head because I began to crave it. I craved the adrenaline that came out of being needed by someone. I started to lose feelings near the end of the summer, and I had no idea why, but looking back on it now, I feel like it’s because I started getting less attention and eventually got bored. 

I KNOW that sounds really bad, but I had no idea what was causing me to feel that way at the time, and now that I do, I don’t feel good abt it. I broke up with him, not only because of this though! This wasn’t rly a normal relationship because after I ended it, he texted me like three weeks later and tried to get me back, and though I was kind of into it, I played hard to get because of the rush that came out of being needed by someone that I don’t necessarily need. We’ve been on and off like 5 times in the past year and now we’re just friends but time to time he flirts w me and I play hard to get again, except this time I’m not actually into it. We always talk and I find myself always talking down on him to make myself feel better. 

I don’t want to keep doing this, I ONLY do this with him. I’m not a bad person, but I lose all control of my judgement and feelings when I talk to him. And I’m sitting here ashamed, I rly don’t want to be this person, but I’ve started resenting him, he bothers me when he doesn’t even do anything.

161,"I'm at a point in my life where I'm genuinely considering threatening lives just to go to prison for fun, I'm stationed in Sweden so jail is not too bad. I've been suicidal for about 4 years now, and I've toyed with my own life many times. I have nobody I could consider close and I only want to have fun in life at this point. I value the life of all equal to that of an insect, so I couldn't care less what happens to others, full on sociopath. Suggestions as to how I should move forward?",19Mar2020,1
162,"Hey everyone, I want to post this somewhere because I have nowhere else to go to without someone stopping me, I’m 16, and tonight I’m going to run the bathtub with my childhood stuffed animal in the same room, im going to drink to numb pain, then I’m going to take the sharpest knives the house and cut my arteries, my inner thighs, my wrists, my neck, any veins I can see, then I’m going to bleed out, I’ll pray for hours, I’m religious, I’m writing notes for family members and my partner, I sent them messages about how much I love them, I’m doing it in the middle of the night because I’ll have hours to do it, I’ll have my Bible in the same room, my cross on, any other things I want to die next to, I’ll take a note on the door to tell my family members not to open it, I don’t want to scar them, I’ll tell them to call someone. I’ll be dead by then",19Mar2020,2

It's free on the app-store and is now waiving premium access for ALL users. Just posting this here in case someone finds it useful. I personally have been using the app for a long time, and there are lots of upsides to it, and no downsides now that premium is free. Hope this helps someone :)

164,"Let me start by saying, I know I sound like the everyday teenager who thinks they have depression.
Although for me I think it's real. I have lived in an abusive household (physical on many occasions but also constant verbal abuse and emotional abuse) for my entire life and I despise my father to the point where I never want to see him again in my life. I have no friends. My brother is just amazing at everything, he has loads of friends, he is extremely clever, he is happy, has a girlfriend and just enjoys life. He always goes to parties and is talking to his friends on discord calls at home. And then there's me, no friends, good grades but not as good as his, depressed, angry and unhappy all the time. I hate my life at home because of my dad and I hate school. My brother hardly any speaks to me and doesn't really want much to do with me at all. I have no enjoyment in life anymore. My happiness has just degraded over the years. My mum says how I used to be a lovely, happy child when I was very young. Then my happiness turned to anger as I grew up and then after counselling at age 12-13 I was less angry, but still quite angry. The only positive aspect of my life right now is my mum as she is always there for me. I have contemplated suicide several times but I have never come close to doing it. The only thing which is stopping me from suicide is my mum; I would never commit suicide as I wouldn't abandon her, she is always here for me. I tried going to the gym and it improved my happiness a tiny bit, and only for a brief period after exercising. I hate sports so they are out of the question. I just spend all my time playing video games on my own and feeling depressed and angry.

There wasn't really much point in this, I just wanted to express my feelings",19Mar2020,1
165,"I've got a few friends who are struggling with really bad anxiety regarding COVID-19. One of which is also going through a very, very rough time in life. 

I have mild anxiety, but apparently my dome doesnt think the virus is anxiety/panic attack worthy. I dont really have a full understanding of how severe anxiety is to live with. 

So what are some different things I can do when I hang out with these folks that may help ease their anxiety?",19Mar2020,1
166,A question I’ve been scared to ask. I have seen loads of people online with it and thought it was a coincidence but I’ve realised it must be a psych ward thing,19Mar2020,1
167,"is there some sort of medication that would essentially dilute over-thinking? or dilute most senses of feeling? 

i'm (20s) struggling with life and i feel that most of it stems from over thinking. 

example: what if i never find someone who will love me? what if i do end up finding them, we get married, and have kids, then they decide that they want a divorce and want to take the kids. how will i continue to live knowing that the person i married stopped loving me? did they ever care to begin with? was i just a convenient option?

after every relationship i have ends and i essentially think like this. 

i know i shouldn't be thinking ahead like this, but i truly don't know how to turn it off. how can i stop it from affecting me. it always gets me into thinking about suicide and each time it get worse and worse. i just want it all to stop
