1,"I have struggled for about 7 months now. I was good for the first half of the year, but then everything with school, my sorority, and trying to be the best I could for my friends took a huge toll on me. I cried all of fall semester. One friend who is still with me now, I met because I broke down before class and she sat with me. I was so overwhelmed. I almost failed my classes. I started drinking heavier than I ever had before. My brain kept me up at night. I reached out to my friends and I just wanted to die. I never hit the point I would do something to myself, but I wanted to just disappear, just wreck, just go to sleep and never wake up. I’ve never struggled with any of this before. I kept telling myself to keep going.

I recently fell prey to a huge wall of insecurity and anxiety, became obsessed with everyone I loved leaving me, lashed out, and consequently lost a good handful of friends. My heart is so heavy. My roommate comes in from work and I’m either on the couch or in bed. I can’t sleep and now am taking sleep aid pills. I’ve had two weeks to set up my planner and buy books for classes but I just haven’t. It’s like the entire semester I barely held on, and now I’m just broken. And I need to get back on my feet because university classes start again Monday.  

I keep telling myself I just have to keep going, but multiple people (roommate, sisters) who have seen me this semester, and now the past three weeks are telling me it may be a good thing to get on anti anxiety or antidepressants. They mentioned it a few months back but I blew them off.

I have an appointment with my counselor on Friday, she’s been with me through all last semester. So I know she is willing to help if I just ask. But I’m terrified. I am so scared I won’t be myself anymore. Im so overwhelmed. Im afraid to go to school even Monday because even though I’ve apologized, I’ve lost my closest friends and Im terrified I’ll see them again. What if the medicine doesn’t work and I’m worse?

I just don’t know if I should keep “going” and eventually things will fix, or if an antidepressant might be what I actually need? Any advice or experience?",05Jan2020,2
2,"Hey, I could use some advice.

I have rage problems in games, especially competitive ones such as League of Legends. Most of the time, I destroy keyboards. 

Today I destroyed my 2nd 120€ keyboard in +- 2 months of time. My fourth (or fifth) one in +- 2 years. It's the tipping point for me. I can't keep going on like this. I have to do something about it. It's not financially or mentally viable.

Fortunately, it's only in games. I've never, ever hit anyone over an argument or out of frustration. In real life, I always manage to de-escalate. When I notice I'm too frustrated or angry, and I just go for a walk to avoid issues, but for some reasons, when I'm in game, my brains seems to think that it's okay to hit my keyboard, tell strangers that they are piece of shit, etc. (Got banned multiple times for telling terrible things in chat)

Another example: In real life/when I'm working, I always blame myself, I try hard to notice my mistakes and to improve and do better. That's how I got this far in school. However, in game, I always blame everybody but myself. e.g. I died because of poor play on my part ? Meh, it was lag/a terrible jungler/a bug.

In short, when game, I seem to subconsciously think that's it's perfectly okay to be a trash human being, possibly because there's no one in front of me ?

Also, do note that I don't always act like this. I'd say 95% of my playtime is perfectly fine. I laugh at my mistakes, don't trash talk beyond measure, etc. But it's that 5% where I completely snap that's the issue.

Unfortunately, a therapist isn't an option. I already went to a therapist and they straight up told me they can't do anything about it because they don't know how to handle those issues. They recommended me to go to a ""gaming addiction clinic"" but that thing isn't what I need. I mean, people that go there are people that have much bigger issues that pale in comparison to my rage problem. I'm not really addicted either. If I can't find a solution, I'll just uninstall League and every single game that triggers this rage.

I love League. I watch league videos daily, I follow every developer update, I buy skins, but it's just can't continue like this. I have to do something about it. Even if it means uninstalling it for ever. (But wouldn't that be curing the ""cause"" and not the issue?)

Thank you.",05Jan2020,2
3,"What questions would you ask a licensed therapist if you had the chance?

I'm part of a group of mental health advocates and therapists creating short video answers to our community's questions about anxiety, therapy, CBT, relationships, and mental health. We wanted to ask reddit and hear your questions, and we'll create fun and engaging videos about them from licensed mental health professionals!

4,"So i don’t really know how to start this, or if this is even the place to express myself but here goes.
So i can’t figure out if i’m actually depressed or pretending/fooling myself. Because i have no reason to be, everything is going great for me at the moment, but i have had semi-suicidal thoughts since the 23. Dec incl. hallucinations (semi-suicidal= thoughts of suicide, but lacking the will power to actually follow through)

I also recently carved the word “HELP” into my wrist, but it’s just exactly covered by my watch. So i can’t decide if i am looking for attention or something else

Also whenever i think about something, i spiral, quickly. 
Example:
I recently got a text from a friend who asked me not to commit suicide (don’t do something stupid) and instantly i thought of insurance, so if i actually did it, they would have a clear conscience or be “off the hook”


So i am a bit stuck, i don’t know why i feel this way, and i don’t think i can tell anybody without (what i percieve to be) negative repercussions",05Jan2020,1
5,"I’ve been having horrible mental health issues for years now and they’re getting easier to deal with, but I’m in such a good relationship now, but I can’t stop panicking myself that I’m going to ruin it or that my boyfriend will suddenly leave me, I’m so anxious and it’s stupid but it’s the way I’ve always been about everything, just nice to say that.",05Jan2020,1
6,"I don't know what is wrong with me.  To start off, I'am 14 years old and extremly lonely. I only have my family and 1 or 2 ""friends"" who do not really support me. Now, that isn't the main problem. My problem is that...sometimes.. I want to get out. What I mean with that is.. complicated..
When I see for example an happy couple I get jealous. If I could kill them I would do it.
I always felt attached to fire and for me it also made fun to hurt small animals.One part of me tells me to be destructive and violent and to be honest it does feel wonderful just to think about it. Maybe tell isnt the right word its more like an urge but an urge you do enjoy. However I do not always think like that. I need help..seriously.. if feel instable, but I dont know what to do.",05Jan2020,1
7,"I know how it feels like to be the outcast, to feel like nothing. Just don't let go. I recommend a song from King Iso 'Keep Breathing' .. go check it out.",05Jan2020,3
8,"I’m a generally healthy 16 year old with a good home life and not much to worry about, and I’m generally a calm person. But since I was about 7, I’ve often (mostly daily, or at least once a week) felt mildly anxious with no cause.
I never really minded, but recently I’ve been tired (even though I shouldn’t be at my age, and I sleep enough each night), and I figure maybe the two are related.
Is this anxiety or is it something else? What do?",05Jan2020,1
9,I’m just always so sad and depressed of recent and for no good reason. I’m so frustrated cause it keeps pushing people away from me. I’m losing my best friends. I hate it so much why do I have this. One of my friends told me that since they had met meI had changed in a person and implied in a bad way. IK that they were just trying to help but it hurt. I tell some of my friends on a small group chat thing that some rough shit is going on for me rn and I might be offline for a bit but they just mock me saying “stop chatting shit” or something along those lines. I’m just so pissed rn. I’m at the point we’re I want to make some big act some big demonstration just to prove that I am serious and that it’s not easy but I won’t. Not yet at least. I’ve got so many problems going on em and U feel like I can’t function. I spend hours in my room starting at the wall. And I always try to be the nice person the person who always stands up for someone and always supports someone but it’s getting out of control. I can’t do this anymore. I’m going to call a helpline to try and fix things but if that doesn’t work well for me then I’m showing my friends that I’m not fucking around. I’m sure most of them don’t know how mad and fucked up I am rn but I feel an undeniable urge to just show them how serious things are. There are only 2 people ik that have attempted to support me and I am forever grateful for that but I feel this burning anger of bottling up things for years and years. I just want to let it out. Sure I might burn bridges but I don’t care anymore. The only thing I would be devastated about is losing those friends who have been so supportive but then again it’s just life. It’s all going to end anyway. I’m going to call the helpline and I really hope it helps cause I don’t want to show how sucked uo I am and I don’t want to burn bridges but I feel trapped and humiliated. Idk. It’s all so confusing. For all I know tomorrow I could completely change my mind. Thx if someone actually decided to read all through this. I just needed to rant somewhere and place down my thoughts,05Jan2020,1
10,"I feel so disconnected. I stopped taking my meds a while back because I realized the only reason I was taking them was to make other people happy. I've been on and off meds since I was eight years old and I can't recall a single time that I felt like they helped (the exception to this is my sleep meds, which do work). Since I made my stand and decided to stop taking them, no one will take me seriously. My mom won't hear anything I say because she feels like I'm choosing to be this low. So I'm left feeling guilty for every single emotion that I feel.

So I'm slowly moving further and further away from reality, trying to figure out if I'm still alive, sending out all sorts of signals only to receive no response. It's like ""the boy who cried wolf"", except every time I call there are really wolves, it's just that people are sick of saving me. 

I don't know why I'm burdening this sub with my so-called selfishness, but I'm honestly so hopeless at this point that it doesn't matter to me either way. As long as someone hears me. For once. 

Because otherwise, I think it's gonna be a long, long time till people see how far gone I am. 

But of course, this is still all ""my fault"" because I'm the one who refuses to poison themselves to comfort others. It's ""my fault"" that I keep getting worse and that I can't function. 

Yeah. It's my fault that I didn't get a childhood and that I was cursed with a genetic predisposition to mental illness and addiction.

That's like saying it's the Spaceman's fault if he gets lost in space, not NASA, even if NASA put him there.

I didn't sign up for this, but people keep treating me as if I did. And the sad thing is, I'm starting to see their point.

After all, it's ""my fault"" that I'm this low, isn't it?
I'm the ""guilty party"" here, right?

13,"TL;DR: Upped my Zoloft dosage from 50 to 75mg almost 2 months ago (on November 15th) and now I'm going through manic and depressive symptoms. How can I do so well on 50 mg but have a total decline at 75?

I'm diagnosed with PTSD and social anxiety disorder, so my psychiatrist put me on Zoloft last April. I was having so much progress and success with 50 mg of Zoloft, but a few months ago I was in a terrible mental state and we went up to 75 mg as o lf November 15th, so almost 2 months soon. 

Now, she's worried I'm potentially bipolar because I immediately swung into mania, which lasted a couple weeks, and now I've been in a month long depressive state. I'm having severe relapse in my social anxiety, which was totally in control before all of this, and my PTSD is getting harder than ever. 

How can this happen? I don't understand how 50 mg was perfect but going up in dosage would make me worse? I'm meeting with my psychiatrist later this month to talk more about it and I'm going back into therapy as soon as my insurance is straightened out, but I feel like I'm going crazy.",05Jan2020,1
14,"1.)  I did something (somethings) stupid--I torched a piece of rag on a porch of an abandoned house which is now all remodled, so something good did come out of that---it is a beautiful home now), then I torched the Dumpster behind the Planet Fitness...twice. Also a shit ton of paper...and wooden pallets)...

2.) My stupid ass got caught...What a moron I am...Sigh. Caught on camera torching the Dumpsters...UGH. 

3.) I got arrested on January 3, 2019 by our Fire Marshal...embarrassing as hell. Much deserved embarrassment.

4.) Got arraigned in front of a Magistrate at 9:00 pm...got told I am a ""Danger To Society"" (direct quote) and my bail was set at $50,000 straight. Needless to say...I didn't even have the 7% ($3,500) that the one BailBondsman wanted. I went to prison (not jail...we have the Big House that houses Federal and State and County cases) and was miserable for days and weeks and month on end.

5.) Had 10 court appearances and was continued 5 times....Months passed. Misery abounded and I learned a lot about myself.

6.) Finally put in my Plea (Guilty of course) on October 2, 2019 and was finally told that I would get my Sentencing Date in the mail...which I did 2 weeks later. It was set for 4 more weeks from them (6 weeks from the Plea Date--normal) which I sweated out. Time passed quickly and I was starting to realize a lot more about the WHYs even though there was NO therapy whatsoever. The other girls (only certain ones) were sounding boards and an ear or three to bend when one of us was feeling extra-miserable and anxious.

7.) FINALLY went to court on November 20, 2019, sat there through 3 other cases (one guy had to pay several-thousand dollars in restitution and he was sentenced to 10-30 years upstate--ouchie) and then stood on front of the judge and he lectured me (MUCH appreciated actually) and then sentenced me to 9-23 months incarceration and a 2 year tail (Probation) TIME SERVED. So I was officially d-o-n-e with the courts! Happy day.

8.) Stupid holidays. Thanksgiving (Nov. 28) and Christmas Day (Dec. 25) AND New Year's Day (Jan.1) ...nobody really works from just before T-Giving until after New Year's...so yeah. I had to spend all that time still in prison. Eh. I knew that was gonna happen so I was ready for it.

9.) Yesterday, on the ONE YEAR anniversary of my arrest (Jan. 3, 2020) I was woken up out of a dead sleep (for real lol) by my cellie pounding on the bottom of my bunk (I was on top bunk) telling me they want me. I said grumpily and sleepily ""What now?"" and then the Block Worker told me to get my stuff together and I just looked at her blankly for about 20 seconds. I was in shock all the way out...hah. I am still not used to being OUT...everything is so...Big and scary.  


Went to the store with my hubby (we took a long walk) and it was almost enough to make me have an anxiety attack. I didn't though and everything was fine. Everything is fine so far. The kids are over the moon to have me home. Hubby can finally relax a little. I did dishes and mopped the floor and am organizing this hot mess we call an apartment. Tee Hee.

So, please NO flaming or negative comments. I have already suffered. I am soley responsible for the suffering of the children...That was my fucking fault. I have to live with that pain that my kids were traumatized terribly.  


Sigh. I know what would help my suffering but I am not keen on violating Probation and making them suffer again. If anything else happens...it will definitely break our family. That is a hell of a load to carry...

But I am ready to do just that, despite the pain in my own heart trying to battle something that is such a part of me and always has been.

19,"Two days ago I went into my mom’s room, anxious for no reason. I just started crying. We talked for a bit, and I felt a bit better. The verdict was I should just calm down. 

But this has been repeated more times than I’d like to count- calming down is easier said than done. I’m on winter break, I have been for quite a bit now, which is supposed to be calming. But instead I have done what feels like absolutely no work and I am still finding things to stress about- now I feel depressed (or sad, it’s hard to tell and I don’t think I have depression, necessarily... I hope) on a daily basis about nothing in particular. I’ve been tired, anxious, and just like something is wrong, on and off for the past two days.  One minute I’ll be fine, the next I’ll want to cry, and maybe the next I have no idea what to do, paralyzed by indecision. 

Back to that night; I went to my room and found this article- it resonated with me so much it made me cry. It was like reading a biography of myself in an alternate universe [or something ](https://www.understood.org/en/community-events/blogs/the-inside-track/2016/05/19/my-anxiety-and-adhd-hiding-behind-a-perfect-veneer?_ul=1*7qo8xl*domain_userid*YW1wLXQ3T0Y2bGh1OThCY3V5empSMUR1UUE). So, I sent it to my mom because I think deep down it was my way of indirectly asking for help. And then, bam. I’d ended up in a conversation about mental health with both parents. It was just so off putting and foreign. We never really talk in depth about mental health- I have ADHD, yes, but it has always seemed to respond great to medication, and it is on the mild-moderate side of the spectrum.

Back to my story. I talked with my parents, and my mom asked me if I wanted a therapist or “just meds”. This sounds malicious, but it really wasn’t.  I said therapist, almost automatically. I think now I’ve finally come to terms with the fact that I need help beyond ADHD meds- anxiety and pervasive perfectionism have always just been “my personality”. Now it seems scary and foreign. The thoughts I have about anxiety are causing me to be more anxious than ever- what if I am just another person who thinks they have some disorder but they really don’t. I have very mild ADHD. Like, on the very line of diagnosis. So what if I’m actually using my medication as a crutch. These are all so irrational- I can’t even get the simplest to do list done in a day without my medication, and what I’m feeling is solvable with professional help. 

So why have I been feeling so emotionally temperamental and nervous? I feel fine now but maybe I won’t in an hour... honestly I am just rambling at this point. My main point is: I have to wait for my parent to find a professional, but that may take a while. How do I cope till then, and stop worrying about something if I have no clue what it is, or why that thing is making me so sad and emotionally fickle?

Premature Ejaculation. (all my sexlife)
Depression. (all my life)
ADHD (diagnosed at 26)
Currently on 10mg Methylphenidate/day for my ADHD, which really seems to help!

took Celexa (citalopram) for 4 years against depression. don't know if it helped with depression but it did with my Premature Ejaculation!
Weened off Celexa because it ""didn't feel"" right and because I read that SSRIs might interfere with ADHD?

I really really want to get rid of my PE because it cause a LOT of anxiety and depression.

help?


-.-.-




I have suffered from premature ejaculation (sometimes less than a minute of penetration) my entire sexlife, which hasn't been not very existent for long periods, since I have very low self-esteem due to my PE.

I have also suffered from depression my entire life to the point where I have been suicidal for about 90% of 2019.

I have now at age 26 finally been diagnosed with ADHD.

I have tried Celexa (citalopram) for 4 years but ulitmately weened it off in 2019 and flew solo, since I somehow had the gutt-feeling, hat Celexa is not the right thing for me. and now I also read that SSRIs, such as Celexa might potentially increase ADHD symptoms. I only had sex while on Celexa for a few times but I believe it helped a LOT with my PE!

currently I am trying a low dose of Methylphenidate (5mg retarted + 5mg unretarted), which seems to help me immensely both with my ADHD and anxiety! yay!

but I am yearning so badly for a somewhat normal sexlife (I am single at the moment and my last girlfriend of 2 year didn't want to have sex due to religious reasons, which is another complicated story.)

now here's the thing:

I want to be healthy. I want to be happy. I want sex.

27,"Tl,dr: What do I do to get in a room and start talking with a therapist. 

I live in Califonia of the US

Growing up, I learned that I was evaluated with the possibility of having ADD or autism. My parents ignored the diagnoses and felt they didnt want me to be drugged or put into any separate system that might make me seem different.

I learned about this maybe 2 years ago. I'm 25 now, I have never been reevaluated for these issues and I've made it through things up to this point in my life so even if I had anything like that I guess you might put it under high functioning. 

The only problem is that I have definate issues I need to work on. Anxiety, self loathing, as well as a possibility of having Disosiative Idenity Disorder. 

My life hasn't been so horrible up to this point. No where near picture perfect but there are so many people going through things worse than I am.

Here is where my problem lies. Between how I was raised with therapy being seen as such a waste of time or something to hold me back, as well as my own doubt that I should even bother a therapist with my problems, I can't figure out how where to start.

The closest I've gotten to setting something up, I scrolled through a list of mental health professionals provided by my insurance, and as I read PTSD, Abuse counseling, Schizophrenia, I felt so stupid and like my problem were such a waste of time and I closed the page.

I need to know where step one is. I need direction.",05Jan2020,1
28," Weird question - I am 23 years old. I have never scheduled any medical appointment. I am on my own health insurance plan.

I suffered from really bad depression and anxiety back when I was 14 - 15 and was on medication then. When I was 16 I got off the medication because I was doing great and have been fine ever since..until this past year. 2 years ago I moved out and got my own apartment so I spend a lot of time alone. I have a ton of hobbies that I usually do solo. I usually don't mind being alone, but now I feel like I have gotten to comfortable being alone that I don't want to spend time with other people, even my family.

I used to always meet up with friends after work or on the weekends. But for the past 6 months or so I always try to find an excuse to not meet up with friends or family. I definitely have noticed over the past couple of months that my social skills have been getting worse (avoiding talking to people at work, avoiding going to parties, bars, etc). I'm usually fine with being alone (I have not seen my friends or family in 2 months) but now it's starting to worry me. I still decline invites out even though I know I should socialize.

I'm certain I have social anxiety. I'm not sure if I have depression, but some days I feel really bad - overthinking everything, past friendships, family relationships, stressing that I am not socializing, etc. I have a good paying job that I love and I wake up with motivation to go to work, or to do errands / hobbies for the day. But if I am not keeping myself occupied, I get very sad.

I believe medication would help me, I think. Or not, maybe I just need a therapist. My question is how do I get mentally evaluated? Do I need to see a doctor? Will the doctor recommend a therapist or do I go straight to a therapist? Or do I need to see a physiologist?

Also, where do I find a doctor / therapist etc? Can I only go to certain ones my insurance provides?

Thank you!",05Jan2020,2
29,"(Sorry for being so wordy I just had a lot on my mind lol) A few months ago I slowly tried to open up to my parents about my crippling anxiety and many other symptoms I’d been experiencing. I’m not one to “self diagnose” but I have had legitimate concerns for years and very little outlets to vent to, confessing to my parents gives me horrible anxiety and my friends just... don’t seem to get it. When I finally started to open up to my family about my concerns and issues at school my father suspected I had adhd and insisted I went to the doctor with him. Of course I agreed and the doctor referred me to a child psychiatrist (I’m still 17) and prescribed me Zoloft for my anxiety. After about a month I stopped taking it because it made me more depressed than I was before and now, two months out from my appointment and I’m becoming increasingly stressed, I was looking up more about the doctor I’ll be seeing and he has a lot of really bad reviews. Having to go see another doctor wouldn’t be a big issue for me if i didn’t have to likely wait another 6 months for a second referral if he really is as bad as some people are making it out to be. Maybe I’m stressing over nothing, I just needed a place to express my thoughts.",05Jan2020,1

Never had someone I could really trust, not even my friends. I have frequent nightmares, lately is has gotten worse. I've already said this on other subreddits with more detail, but I really need help. Even if my life right now is ok, the past won't let me go. It drags me into it and I can't escape.

32,"TL:DR - My girlfriend blames me for our temporary financial problem and verbally abuses me here and there. Recently she has launched an attack at me against my mum, and this time it doesn’t seem like her ego talking. She has been arguing with me about the same things for 3 days but each day she resolutes it and says “its okay xx we shouldnt be fighting like this” 


So recently I’ve had an argument with my girlfriend and currently we are in a quiet bad financial situation we are both low on money but I return back to work in a couple of days we both smoke weed as she is quite more dependent on weed then I am but recently we have had an after pay is due and she would be the one that has to pay it because I currently have no funds in my account until I return to work she’s very upset about it and hasn’t now for a past four days abuse me called me names and blame me for a lot of things that’s not my fault she’s called my mother a bitch and called my mother a lot of names that I can’t imagine she justifies her calling my mum names and get mad at me when I stick up for my own mother she expects me to side with her and agree with her every time she says something bad about my mum and only reason at the moment that she is quite upset with my mum is due to the fact that on Christmas she received a present f from my mum of $50 and three hand creams two of the hand creams had been opened my girlfriend was quite upset about it and asked me to message my mum my mum had then told me she had not opened it whatsoever and had been straight straight from the store I told my girlfriend that but she refused to believe it and continues to think of my mum as a disgusting and horrible person which is what i keep hearing from her. She also makes a lot of threats to kill yourself and I don’t mean here in there but every time I hang up the phone because I’m sick of hearing the horrible things about my mum she will call back and say  “if you hang up on more time I will kill myself” in the past fight with had she would tell me to tell her everything that she has done wrong and should be sorry for it but today I told a something that had ticked me off but rather made me quite upset to and she told me to get over it. and this is just a side note but for Christmas I received $30 from her mum and dad combined but from my side she received $50 for my mum and 100 from my dad but yet she still thinks that my mother and dad don’t give a crap about her. my girlfriend and my dad never see each other due to the fact that me and I don’t have a rocky relationship already but also the fact that she never wants to come to any of the restaurant we go to because she doesn’t eat any of the food and most of the time it’s already been a premade family event so she gets quite upset and said no I will not come. I live with my mum though and I spent quite a lot of time with her..well i used to. nowadays I spend all my days weekends and hours with my girlfriend I’m not complaining at all but at the same time it just seems like you’re always at her house and not at mine what nowadays I go to work from six in the morning until three in the afternoon I never get to see my mum in the morning because shes asleep and when I come home from work I have to go to my girlfriend straight away or at least like to sometimes but most times it’s just to make sure that she doesn’t get mad at me. 
My girlfriend always tells me that I don’t care about her I don’t stick up for her but I’ve dedicated my whole life to her pretty much I don’t spend time with mum any more I never get a whole 24 hours a week with her only two my girlfriend always tells me that I don’t care about her I don’t stick up for her but I’ve dedicated my whole life to her pretty much I don’t spend time with mum any more I never get to spend time with my mum. She brings up all the time that it’s never good to bring up stuff from the past but she always brings up about what my mum has done to her in the past even though it’s nothing bad she still has a grudge against my mum from the first week that we started dating when she couldn’t get any sleep because my girlfriend was sick and coughing all night nowadays it’s a different story even though if she coughs my mum doesn’t bother she brings up all the time that it’s never good to bring up stuff from the past but she always brings up about what my mum has done to her in the past even though it’s nothing bad she still has a grudge against my mum from the first week that we started dating when she couldn’t get any sleep because my girlfriend was sick and coughing all night nowadays it’s a different story even though if she coughs my mum doesn’t ask her to be quiet any more she understands. do you have my work Christmas party was one of the worst times I’ve had to experience she had gotten very very very very upset at me because I had gone to a Christmas party but that wasn’t the thing that made her upset it was the fact that she thought I was going to cheat on her because of her past experiences and I completely understand that but at the same time I insured her nothing is going to happen and especially due to the fact of being together for the past two years. during the work party I had messaged her for a whole hour because we were doing an activity together and I had messages straight after to let her know that everything was okay but by the time I message to back and hour later she had already gone over to write about how angry she was. she said that I probably would’ve been cheating on a lot of people and that I am a cunt and much much more horrible names. The only reason this is taken three days to write is due to the fact that she has been going over the same argument three days in a row every single day for the past three days she has gotten angry about me about how we have no money and how she will have to pay for everything until I go back to work every day for the past three days she had gone angry about how my mum got a used hand creams every day for the last three days I’ve been hearing about how much of a cunt and horrible bitch in a miserable bitch my mum is every day for the past three days I’ve been hearing about how I do nothing and how this is all because of my fault. 

This was one of the hardest things to write, Because when so many things want to come out at once you forget how to let out each feeling. Even forgetting what those feelings were. This was the only way i was able to let you guys know whats still going on and for me to see if im going crazy with how im viewing this. 
I dont want to kill myself, but im also finding it hard to find happiness here. Im asking her to change, But instead of finding a resolution or progress, shes telling me if i dont like it i should leave despite the small progress shes made in the start. Its starting to feel like a warzone aswell, Between me and her and her mum, But not so much her mum as she gets dragged into it by my girlfriend. But then shes forced to give an opinion about the situation and most times shes siding with her but with ridiculous things obviously she understands my point of view. i dont know guys. its getting abit too much at this point but its nothing new for me.",05Jan2020,1

Right now im staying with my biological dad because he lives the closest to my therapist. He's a sportsman like the rest of his family but im the runt of the litter. I just watched two of my cousins on national TV prove themselves to be the best and here i am in shambles with nothing accomplished. My dad and his wife told me i should just push on and my dad wont drop that i should've stayed in sports and maybe i could have been fulfilled but i only played in the first place so he would look at me like he does my cousins. 

Im so confused and alone and i don't know what to do, everyone wants to help me but they don't know how or don't understand i just need someone to care. I feel like such a failure and weak, ive never felt so vulnerable and my life and no one understands even though they try.",05Jan2020,1
40,"I live in Australia, and the bushfires burning for the last few weeks have been horrible. Im lucky enough to live somewhere that hasnt been in the direct path of the fires, but the air quality has been awful (the worst of any major city in the world) and yesterday was the hottest day on record with the fire danger extreme. Not to mention deranged people intentionally lighting fires in these conditions.

I havent been able to sleep the last few days without the tv on and help of my medication, my mind just wont stop worrying. The smoke is causing my eyes to burn and coughing and headaches. I have a bag packed and have been keeping my car topped up with petrol just in case, and my landlords have put sprinklers on the roof. Today you cant see because of the smoke, its worse than the thickest fog I have seen. 

 I feel powerless and unable to help, watching people have their homes destroyed, lives lost. The death toll for the wildlife is incomprehensible. I tried to donate blood but was unable too due to my headaches. Last night while unable to sleep i went through and packed up 6 bags of clothes to donate. I cant contribute much financially but have donated what I can. 

Its a strange kind of helplessness in the face of such a catastrophic event. There isn't anything to do but pray for rain, help in small ways for people affected by the fires, and be prepared should disaster strike. I feel horrible for feeling horrible if that makes sense? So many people have lost everything, and here I am safe but riddled with anxiety, feeling sorry for myself. I cant seem to stop shaking the last two days. Its a constant battle in my head catastrophising everything and beating myself up for selfish thoughts.

44,"I have been so terrified of death for as long as I can remember. I used to cry to my mom when I was around 7 or so about the fact that I was going to die one day and there was nothing I could do to stop it.

I recently decided to force myself to accept it by thinking about it constantly. I figured I’d eventually accept it from overexposure to the concept. It actually worked kind of, because now I no longer get panic attacks from thinking about it. I still have dread though, not really anxiety but just lowkey fear. It’s kind of like the feeling before walking into school in the mornings. I don’t have like a full on panic attack, but more of a “well fuck guess I’m gonna have to do this shit”

This doesn’t excuse the fact that I’m still scared though. Every time I look at someone all I can think about is the fact that they’re gonna die, and so am I. I’m only 15 and if I do get to live out my full lifespan, that means I have a long time but I just can’t help but to think about how scared I am of growing old and just dying.

45,"To preface: I do have borderline personality disorder. I don’t know if this thing is related or not, but it’s making me really nervous because I feel like there’s something wrong with me. 
I do this thing where I have a whole other life and version of myself in my head. I have pretend friends, (who are usually celebrities I really like, as I want to be an actress), and I talk to them out loud sometimes. I invent different fantasies of things I did with these people. I know that none of it is actually real, but sometimes I still feel like the people are actually there when I’m alone. 
It’s like I’ll be about type/write something or do something people usually do when they’re alone, and I’ll get all self conscious about it. Then I’ll be like “what the hell, there’s literally nobody here what’s wrong with you.” 
I usually only slip into the world and talk to myself, (I don’t talk for the people, the people talk in my head. It’s like I’m playing with an imaginary friend only I can hear.), when I’m alone. However, sometimes I will accidentally start thinking the people are around me when I’m actually around real people. It’s not like the imaginary people replace the real ones, they’re added. I also never talk to myself in front of people, but I have pretended to make eye contact with someone who wasn’t there in front of a real person before.
Anyway, I’m really worried about this. I’m afraid I’m crazy or something. Acting is huge part of my life, and I think about how my life will be when I finally get to do it as a long term job a lot of the time. I guess I just need possible answers/advice to feel better.",05Jan2020,2

54,"Hi all. So I have an aunt with some kind of undiagnosed mental illness, probably paranoid schizophrenia or something similar. She always thinks she's being stalked, spied on, and that her phones, emails, etc. are being hacked. She also thinks basically literally everyone is out to get her. For example, she literally thinks the whole ""lgbt community"" is out to get her. She thinks everyone in her religion is out to get her, even though she tries to stay in it. Most painful for me, my grandma and then dad died within a very short period of each other, leading to some problems and delays in settling my grandma's estate. My uncle was the executor, and she got it into her head that he was cheating us somehow, and tried to sue him, audit the estate, etc., as well as get into a lot of hurtful arguments with him that I suddenly became involved in as I became the heir in my dad's place when he died. Well, soon after she started all this stuff with the will, she cut off all communication with both me and my uncle, changed her phone and email (as she often does), and she is always traveling around the country, so we have no fixed address to contact her...

Over Christmas she reconnected with me via text. I'm happy to talk to her via text as long as it is about innocuous things and not like the will or any of her other allegations. However, she said she wanted to talk on the phone because her text messages are ""hacked as usual."" I told her I would call her when I got home from Christmas vacation... However, I have phone anxiety even for normal conversations (I have general and social anxiety), let alone one like this... I haven't worked up the nerve to call her and it's a day after I said I would. I tried to just now but I started getting the onset of a panic attack, and even my cat seemed concerned about me... Sometimes she can carry on a totally normal conversation, but obviously sometimes she can't. I'm worried if I don't call her, it'll play into her paranoia, but I also don't know if it is a good idea for my own mental health to call her... So I guess I'm wondering if you all think I should just bite the bullet and call her, or is there some way to explain to her that I can't without freaking her out further?  I often feel anxious right before calling anyone normally, and then it goes fine, so I don't know if that is just the case here...",05Jan2020,1
56,"I guess I’m just venting because I’ve witnessed mental illness way too many times. This is a long post so be warned. I’ve also witnessed friends go through mental illness as well. Though, this is what has happened within my family. 

My brother had depression during his high school days and had to spend an extra 2 years to graduate. He slept all day in his room so I never saw him. When I did, he was yelling and arguing with my parents. I was about 5 when this happened. A few years ago, he was in an abusive relationship due to his poor anger management as well. He’s moved in and out of my parent’s house because of his depression and failure to support himself. 

My sister also had major depression during high school. She self harmed and tried to kill herself. There was constant arguing and intensity within the house. I was in middle school when this went down. She’s doing better now but is in EMDR and getting herself sorted out. 

My mother also had a depressive episode because her mom died from cancer (which is understandably hard to deal with). My parents were at risk of divorce but never did. I was roughly age 10 when this happened. Not to mention, I ALSO have anxiety from 14 surgeries in childhood. So, there’s a lot of mental health problems in my family.

This is stuff that I’ve never talked about with anyone. It’s just too much to think about. Fuck, I haven’t even told everything in this post. Even my therapist doesn’t extensively know this. Though, I plan on talking about this one day but it keeps being put on the back burner. 

Many of my friends are going through mental illness at this moment. I don’t ever want to bear witness to another person with mental illness. I’m sorry if I sound shitty because that’s the exact opposite of what should be said and enforces the stigma. However, there’s just something about it that just makes it scary as fuck as a witness.

For a long time I’ve been living with an irrational fear of how people perceive me, and am scared of the idea of being something people don’t like/want. I have extreme trouble interacting with other people and have an unshakable idea that nobody I know or am friends with like me, or if they do it is merely circumstantial or something I did to make them like me. The few friends I have I am very dependent on, while simultaneously unable to adequately interact with them out of fear of provoking or annoying them. I am very dependent on seeking praise, while simultaneously being completely incapable of accepting it as honest, and usually only seek it for the positive attention. I have absolutely 0 self confidence or positive self image whatsoever, and regularly psych myself into a state of unbearable depression when alone with my thoughts for too long. I feel like a loser on every metric imaginable, mentally, physically, and emotionally, and can only see myself for my flaws.

He sent a letter with a different address than the last one so I'll try to send it there. If he doesn't get it I don't know what I'll do.

63,"Hey 
I'm 19, a young Male and having a breakdown, as short as I can put it I'm on the edge of a ward or doing something stupid and it's a shitty situation but it's the one I'm in. I have a girlfriend and she has noticed me being ""distant"", she doesn't really know and is saying she cares, but every other ex who ""cares"" abandoned me when I let them in, i guess I'm curious as what people think. Let them in? let them go? Lie? 

Any female users, what would you prefer your significant other to do? 

Male users, what would you do ?

I'm just in a confusing situation and dont know what to do.

64,"I've been crying all day and now it's 2 in the morning and I can't sleep because I can't stop crying.

My boyfriend (19m) and I (20f) have been dating for 2 years.

He's from out of the country and is staying for two years. He got here a year and a half ago and now we have less than six months together before he has to go back.

We aren't sure how long he'll be gone this time. It could even be years. 

He wanted to break up with me after he left but after some conversation, we decided that breaking up wouldn't do either of us good.

I just don't know what I'm going to do when he leaves. I've never lived alone. I only very recently got out of my abusive family. I don't have any friends. I have no one other than my boyfriend and once he leaves the country, I'll have no one within 36 hours of travel that I can talk to, other than my parrot who gives me bad anxiety.

I'm just so broken and I don't know what to do with it all. I don't want to lose him and it's going to be so hard to go back to long distance.

It doesn't help that I have very bad mental health. I don't work right now because of it. I won't be able to afford our apartment when he leaves and I don't think he seems to think it'll be a problem.

He has a nice, loving family. He has friends.

I'm going to be stuck here alone (for months at least). I have no idea how to take on the world. My abusive parents didn't teach me how to live. They taught me how to live under someone who tells me what to do... and now I'm fucked and alone.

I don't even know why I'm posting this. I just need help and I have no idea where to go for it. I'm so hopeless and I don't know how I'm going to survive living on my own with no help and trying to stay alive through my mental shit. I just don't know if it can be done.",05Jan2020,1
65,"Let’s start from the beginning. When I was a child, I was blind to the world. I was a kid after all. Ever since my pre-teen years to now, I have grown a lot since then. My knowledge of the world, my mind, grew such amazing lengths since then. Since childhood, I always changed. My mind always grew and developed. I went through many different phases and dreams. Since childhood, I struggled with this existence. My consciousness was adapting to its own creation. I developed mentally to figure out what I wanted to be, what I wanted to do with my existence. what my life was. I could tell many stories about this development, like how I wanted to be many different things when I would grow up, shit like that. My mind grew and changed. My life, everything in the universe has led to this moment. Everything piece fell into place. I think now, this development is over, for the most part at least. For my mind, my knowledge, this, now, the present, is at the height of itself. 

Anyways. Let’s talk about the current day. I was thinking about writing this, this part of my mind, for a while now. Something big is going to happen soon. I’ve had this on my mind for a long time. I’m not sure what the future will bring. I’m not sure what is gonna happen, but something huge is on our way, something that will change life, maybe the universe, existence as we know it. I have many theories about this hypothetical event. I’ve been thinking about this forever. One theory is that something catastrophic will happen. Maybe WW3 will happen, who knows? It could happen tomorrow for all we know. Another theory is that maybe the afterlife does exist. I’m an agnostic, so I don’t follow religion is general, however, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the afterlife doesn’t exist. What lies after death is all speculation. Maybe there is an afterlife, and there’s something huge, maybe even mentally incomprehensible to the human mind, that will happen after our death in the universe. You could go full philosophical here. Maybe the universe is an illusion. If you ever heard of the simulation theory, maybe it is true. Maybe, after death, we still experience consciousness. If the universe is a creation by a society or god(s), maybe they will explain the universe to us after we die. Not sure. I don’t know. Maybe something great and amazing and game-changing will happen in the future. It’s all speculation at this point. I don’t know what will happen, but something is going to happen someday, I can feel it. Something will happen that will be huge. Maybe my life has been preparing for this moment. Maybe my brain, my consciousness, is only a small part of reality. Again, if there is a god, or creators, or simulators, or whatever, maybe there’s a world outside of our own. Maybe life is a video game, or a movie, with a plot and a story, not sure. Maybe there’s a point to my existence. After all, again, if you want to go the philosophical route, how do I know if you all exist or not? Maybe you’re all NPCs and shit like that. Maybe my life has led up to this point for a reason. My life has been dropping me hints of this reason. Maybe it’ll all make sense in the end.

I’ve had a fantasy for a long time. This fantasy has been something I’ve had on my mind for over a year or so. The fantasy starts from now, the present, to my eventual death. There are many forms and different directions it takes, but it follows the same storyline basically. I start off like I do now, but something happens. Some event, maybe a failed suicide attempt, or whatever big event, happens, and I change. My whole life, I have felt powerlessness. All the thoughts I have held in my head, all the beliefs and feelings, I’ve hid away from people. There’s a lot on my mind that I just started sharing to the internet, like I am now, but still, my mind is very vague to people. I’m trying to give more of my thoughts to other people out there, but I don’t know if I can. I feel so powerless, like I won’t be able to change things. I’ve been trying to get my thoughts out there, to wake people up to the truth that has haunted me for years. The next part of my fantasy is me starting my plan. My plan to wake people up and that kind of shit. I start with my parents. My parents are blind to the truth, they don’t know what I know. I later wake them up, and then, I enter adulthood. It’s always been my dream, a huge part of this fantasy, that over the years and in my life, I grow in supporters and popularity, I later become an important person in the world, a huge political and philosophical figure, I grow in support, and I wake everyone up to reality. How I do this, I don’t know, but I eventually gain power and after many years, and waking the world up, we start a revolution, against the governments, the Elite, those in power. We eventually overthrow and destroy the governments, taking the corrupt out of power. We eventually win the battle, and create our own society, our own government(s) and system, and create it in our view. We later celebrate in peace, and go on as a species to colonize space or do whatever. I die, after knowing I have just saved the world from destruction. 

So yeah, that’s the fantasy I’ve had. I really do wish it happens, I really do. This has been my dream forever to wake people up and save humanity. I don’t care about the power, or the money, or whatever, I want to help people. I’ve never been a misanthrope, I’ve always loved humanity. I’ve always wanted humanity to grow and develop as a species, not kill itself off and die. The human race is so amazing, our societies, our cultures, etc. All the achievements and memories that we have made as a species. Ever since I was a kid, I was fascinated with the many aspects of human life, like how are we so smart? How did we develop so many things in just a couple hundred-thousand years?! It’s insane how we grew and developed. I don’t want humanity to die. The thought of us going extinct is honestly depressing. Even the little things in life are amazing, and for all that to be wiped out of existence like the snap of a finger, (Thanos lol) is pretty sad. However, I have doubts. I know it’s all just a fantasy. I feel so powerless in life. Everyone has more control than me. How am I gonna change things? My parents and family probably wont listen, and if they do, they’re obviously not gonna wake up to the truth, they’re not gonna agree with my thoughts and beliefs. If I can’t change my family’s mind, how am I gonna wake up the whole world, much less start a fucking revolution?! I don’t know. I really hope in the future my life and mind will make sense. Who knows? Thanks for listening to me, sorry for the long post, but I needed to get this out of my head. It’s a great feeling to get something off your chest. Thanks!",05Jan2020,1
66,"Male 22, I was recently diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. My whole life, I thought I was normal. I thought this was what a real, normal human life was like. To save a lengthy story, I ended getting a diagnosis and honestly, it’s only made me want to end my life even more. Everything makes too much sense now but yet I’m still trying to figure out what’s real and what’s not and I don’t even know what I’m trying to think and everything is too much. I poked around on reddit to find some BPD communities. I found a specific one and not even 5 posts in and I’m sick to my stomach and having a nervous break during my overnight shift at work. I never realized how much people hate us, those people have so much hate and resentment for exes and family with BPD. They are moving cities and changing phones numbers just to get away from them. They hate them, they wish them death. They don’t think we’re human. I just feel like a disgusting, uncontrollably abusive monster.

73,"I have had a really tough week, mentally.

It started with hyping up a crush I have had for years. I’ve always known the possibility of acting on this crush was not an option, however going into the new year I wanted to speak to a couple friends about it. After some long individual discussions with these people, I came back to the realization that a relationship could never come from this crush and that I, and my friends, hyped it up to me for nothing. From here I began to spiral.

The initial thought of this crush caused me to have very bad anxiety even thinking about talking to this girl. I lost a lot of sleep over it. Then I lost even more sleep after I began to think of myself negatively and go down that rabbit hole of thinking.

I reopened many mental pathways for my negative thoughts to creep back in. And only a day after I had been so happy with the possibility of finally addressing this crush after almost 6 years, I fell into a depressive state.

Over the last few days, my eating habits have ranged between eating almost nothing to binge eating when I finally get myself to have something. My sleep schedule is completely off because of my racing thoughts, causing me to take hours to fall asleep and then sleeping well into the afternoon. I have begun to have small bouts of crying over small thoughts, such as “you’re a fucking fat loser who doesn’t deserve to be happy” or “you’ll never find someone to love you and you’re going to die alone so get used to this feeling.” Ive also been very angry at myself and others because of this, as I become jealous of people who don’t have to feel like this.

I feel as though I want to hit a reset button on my life, start with a clean slate. I hate my current position of being a graduate student, hate my interests as nothing is truly giving me pleasure anymore. I hate details about myself ranging from my fashion to the way I interact with people to the way a small piece of my body is formed like a finger.

On top of all of my personal issues, the problems around the world, including the bushfires raging in Australia and the possible war between Iran and America further pushed my depressive state into a darker place.

Today I was a little better but not much. Talking about it with friends only helps so much, as most of them just have general suggestions to fix my way of thinking that I’ve all heard before. And being with friends in person has distracted me a little bit I keep getting drawn back into this state.

I guess if you’ve read this far into my rant/story I’d like to thank you because I don’t know anyone who would’ve listened this long without trying to just stop me and say I’m overthinking things or I’m just not in the right headspace. If you have any sort of advice for me to help, other than “change up a few things in your life” or “go for the crush” or “only focus on things in your control” it would be greatly appreciated.

77,"For some context I’m a 21f with a history of childhood trauma, and have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder. 
Several months ago I experienced the most stressful time of my life and spent nearly a week in a state of almost constant panic. From the moment I woke up my heart would be palpitating and I literally believed I was going to die. Anxiety attacks to the extreme to the point I had to be hospitalized, I lost nearly 15lbs in a span of one week because I just couldn’t get any food down. 
Now, after that stint I got some help and got on some medications (an off brand Zoloft and hydroxyzine as needed) and that really seemed to help level me off. I still have highs and lows but I’m much more regulated. 

However...after that stressful time and since coming back off Zoloft I’ve been having these weird hallucinations. I’m not even sure if that’s what to call them. 

Randomly, a few times throughout my days I’ll catch glimpses of dark figures. As if just out of eyesight and they always seem to be just moving away from my line of vision when I turn my head to check. Sometimes it’s a large mass in the corner of my ceiling and when I look directly at it, there’s nothing. No shadow, nothing. 

Sometimes it’s in the corner of my room or just in my peripheral. Sometimes it seems like a human shadow and sometimes it’s like tiny black bugs swarm a wall for a split second. Just now I thought I saw a black swirl peering around my shower curtain. 

It’s confusing and makes me wonder if somethings wrong with my brain but when I see these things I don’t feel immediate fear, more like “what the hell?”  

So these started after that long state of panic and have continued since being on and off of medication. Could that extreme amount of stress triggered something? Is it developing because of my age? Am I just imagining things? 

I have a therapist and I know I should really be asking her...I guess I just didn’t know if I could say it out loud yet. It’s a bit scary to think I’m losing control of my reality.",05Jan2020,1
79,"What I refer to as “going away” is, in essence, a fesling of detachment from my body and mind. I feel like my entire body has gone numb preventing me from speaking and being able to tell people around me what’s going on. I have a few grounding techniques like trying to focus on touching my fingers together in a specific order or trying to describe the feeling of my feet in my shoes in my head. This used to only happen occasionally when I was younger but since I turned 14 (I think) it’s been happening quite frequently. I think my parents can realize when it’s happening now because I’ve brought it up to them a few times. 

For some background, I’m a 16 year old diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and gender dysphoria disorder. I’ve experimented with a few drugs, mostly weed, nic, and ecstasy. I only included the dysphoria because even though I don’t like bringing attention to that aspect of myself, my psychiatrist thinks the intense anxiety that stems from it could have something to do with it even though things that trigger my dysphoria don’t always make me “go away”. I’ve also had this phenomenon where, and this has been happening for as long as I can remember, I will worry that I’m hallucinating everything and I’m actually doing something inappropriate or something that i shouldn’t otherwise be doing but I don’t know it because in my mind I’m somewhere else if that makes sense. The most frequent one is where I’ll be using the bathroom and I get a sudden rush of anxiety and start to think to myself, “what if I’m actually sitting at the dinner table with my family and I’m going in my pants and I’m just hallucinating that I’m in the bathroom?” but I think that’s probably due to social anxiety. 

What’s odd is that something small and stupid could trigger it or sometimes it comes on without any trigger at all. The last times I can recall in detail of this happening were last night when my mom made a joke about me finishing some chips or something when she wanted them and I felt conflicted on whether she was serious or not and a very strong sense of guilt which made me go away. Another time, that to my knowledge didn’t have a trigger, was when my dad and I were pulling out of a shopping center and I just felt myself slip away and tried to ground myself with the finger thing. My dad kept trying to encourage me to come out of it by saying things like “come on lucas, talk to me, you can do it” and it passed after 30 seconds to a minute. I also remember this happening when I was at a chinese buffet with my parents that has a sad and grungy atmosphere and it made me go away. 

My dad thinks this could be dissociation but after some quick googling I don’t think that’s what it is because it doesn’t sound like the results I got however I am in no way a professional and neither is google. Any help or advice or even solidarity would be greatly appreciated. 

TL;DR stress or tension sometimes makes my body go numb and feel like I’m not in control of it and cannot move it or speak and this sometimes happens unprovoked. I also sometimes feel like I’m hallucinating my surroundings or am watching somebody else’s life through a first-person movie. I’m 16 with a few diagnosed mental health issues and have been on antidepressants and anxiety meds for over two years now, as well as a few other drugs such as weed, nicotine, and ecstasy most frequently.",05Jan2020,4
80,"I'm sitting right now thinking about my life, my emotions etc to make sense of what I'm feeling and going through to explain that to psychiatrist and I just realized that I feel disconnected to things that are normal. I don't know if it's because I'm so stuck in my head, I feel like I'm doing nothing but being in daspair. I am kind of high functioning and try to cover and hide my issues, but when I reflect back at what is 'good' in my life like for example studying, attending classes, having good grades I don't feel connections to this. I know it happend but I don't feel like I really was doing this. It just glides somewhere outside of me. It can be because of my low self-esteem that tends to make me feel like any of my achievements are either luck or nothing important at all, while I take blame for things that go wrong, and I tend to generalize and think everything in my life is so bad, so I kinda repress all the good and normal things to the point I feel like a imposter or a fake and like I'm disconnected. Or maybe it's because when the good things happen I'm in the flow so I don't overthink them as much as I do when I'm feeling down. I feel really lost right now and kind of uncomfortable tbh.",05Jan2020,1
81,"Hi! Since some days, I have a problem with sleeping.
I go to bed as I've always done, but instead of falling asleep, I just start turning around, I get hot and my heartbeat accelerates. During this process I have a storm of thoughts flooding my mind I don't know how to get rid of. This goes on for hours. When I'm so tired that I start falling asleep, I get right away that sensation of suddenly falling and waking up with a gasp and my heart racing again. I noticed that this gets worst when I work/study till late, while it's less strong when I go to bed earlier. 

Last night was the worst ever and it started to worry me, that's why I'm writing here. I turned off the lights at past 1 am because I had been having a conversation via texts about aeronautical engines with a friend (we're aerospace engineering students at the most stresful university of our country). All I know is that at half past 3 am I was still awake, my heart pounding and thoughts storming. I experienced the fall-down-and-wake-up (I don't know how to call it) at least more than 5 times, wincing in my bed any time I was close to sleeping. I got up, drank some water, walked around the house. Got back to bed, listened to 10 mins of relaxing music and that kind of helped clearing my mind, but I never really fell into a deep sleep till when the alarm started off.

Along with this, I think I'm becoming slightly hypochondriac because I'm often worried of being sick or of getting some sort of incurable illness and I tend to see everything way worse than it actually is. Like, I realize my way of worrying and seeing things is wrong - still it happens and I don't know how to stop doing so.

I don't know what happens to me at night, every time it's like experiencing small panic attacks. I did experience some panic attacks by day in June during the summer exams session that would get to me out of the blue and I would suddenly feel like I couldn't breathe, sweat cold, feel my hands freeze and my head dizzy and heart pounding. But then I would just tell myself that I was an idiot and it was all in my mind and I could breathe so I handled it in some minutes and got back to normal. I thought that was solved, but now similar things have started to happen to me again but at night and somehow I don't feel as strong as to fight them again.

I'm worried and I don't know what to do.

Sometimes i think I'm over it and i just sit up, pick up the spray and kill it. Sometimes I jump and just have like a breakdown but its all internal because if my dad sees mw crying or some shit like that he'll get all concerned. Its like, cockroaches make a noise when they fall down? And the boiler drips onto my blanket sometimes so the sound is really similiar. I'm not coping bruh. I can't put my head down properly without thinking about them. I swear to god I'm feeling them when they're not there. I feel like its on my skin, i check to look, and there's nothing.

i really want to die. i’m just so angry all the time for no reason. and anxious. there’s nothing left for me to do. but i’m too scared to kms. hell i can’t even cut myself it sends me into a panic attack. everything freaks me out.

i could never go to a mental hospital with my selective mutism and separation anxiety. also i don’t think i’m bad enough to go because i wouldn’t kill myself no matter how much i want to.

i spend most of my time on twitter. i’m addicted to it and have been for like 5 years. everything on that site pisses me off or makes me want to cry. like i can’t enjoy any fanbase or character without seeing someone talk down upon it. and there’s so many people on there who are even more sensitive than i am. yet those are the same people that make jokes when celebrities die, they’re very selective on what they find offensive. literally everything on there fucks with me and i have nobody to be there with me ever. that is my only social outlet i have and if i leave i’ll just be stuck in the house like normal but with even less to do.",05Jan2020,4

93,I have restless leg syndrome in both of my legs. Technically it isn't diagnosed but it's the only term I have to describe it. And every day I feel like I'm getting more and more disconnected from reality. It's like my eyes are security cameras and I'm just sitting inside my head just looking at everything happening and pressing buttons to make me move. I know no one else thinks the same way I do. They are all so natural. If people thought the way I did society wouldn't be able to exist. I feel like I'm going insane.

94,"As somebody who studies psychoanalysis in a cursory sense and has overheard psyche majors talking about their discipline and has been through the whole mental health system in my University (my school has a Mental Hospital so you can't even leave school if you're having an emergency), I have to say that it seems like the entire thing of ""Mental Health Care"" is fairly poor at treating anyone and doesn't help much with the existential crises which are involved with living in modern society. Although it was only a theory of mine until recently a [study](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-effects-of-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-as-an-A-Johnsen-Friborg/ba5fa04b5f4556cc6ccdc3e4004fe0ec28f6a188) I found confirms that the effectiveness of CBT (the most popular therapy in America) has declined since its inception, and its initial effectiveness (in my opinion) has more to do with the booming economy of the 60s and 70s and the general condition of the people than the ""scientific"" effectiveness of the treatment. It seems like the majority of people who work in mental health don't have a good idea what of they're doing and the success of the treatment has almost everything to do with the patients themselves. I've known people who spent a week (me) in a mental hospital and needed no further treatment, and others who've been in and out of them for years with no end in sight. Considering that it is practically illegal to mention suicidal thoughts in a mental health setting, a lot of young people have formed unofficial support groups for each other--though these can have disastrous effects (consider the self-harm communities which idolize very dangerous forms of cutting). Even though more and more people are seeking out these services, it seems that they have become sorely ineffective, so as to create a whole lot of bloat without much actual help. I'm wondering why bother, the answers don't seem to be in therapy. On the other hand, if not therapy, then where else? People get addicted to all sorts of bullshit for help; and besides like, exercise, which has light benefits for mental well being (for those severely afflicted), nothing has really helped much at all.",05Jan2020,6
95,"Two years ago (literally on boxing day) my boyfriend (and fiance for about a day) asked me to marry him. We were dating for 5 years, he put me through hell and back, and I still stayed (stupid, I know). We were going through another one of his cheating episodes, but little did I know he was living with the girl after I kicked him out and we were trying to work on things. 
Anyways, boxing day he asked me to marry him and stupid ass me said yes... The same night he decided to ""go sleep at his apartment"" and literally went to her house, fucked her, and slept. 
Obviously we broke up for good (he left me for her like 2 weeks later) I was absolutely heart broken. 
End of June hits (4-5 months of literally not leaving my house, crying, depression) I found out he took his new gf and he's daughter to the lake house we were planning our wedding.... That was it. I tried to kill myself. I didn't succeed thank God.
I ended up in the hospital and only my family and he knew (due to my family fucking losing it).

That same year I picked my life back up 100%. I went back to college. Graduated on time with a nursing aid degree and was accepted to nursing school, found a great boyfriend, and things were starting to finally be amazing. 

Fast forward to three days before Christmas this year. (2 years later)
My amazing new bf and I are engaged and just posted our engagement announcement.
An hour later I get a message from some random person ""someone has put you on this website just trashing you""
And sends me the link...
The link was to a website a lot of my town uses 
""This girl is a piece of shit, blah blah blah whore, blah blah blah engaged three times in a year (WHAT?! TO WHO) Oh btw SHE TRIED TO KILL HERSELF AND WAS PUT IN THE HOSPITAL SHES SUCH A LIAR SHE FAKES IT SHES MENTALLY ILL.

I can't believe this is happening to me.. what did I do so god damn wrong in life...

He said all these things despite knowing that things in his life are good and that people think he's a nice person.

He also said he wanted to calm down and fall asleep. Like physically calm down, but I don't know if he was having an anxiety or panic attack or what. Towards the end of our conversation he said ""I've pushed it out and I think being alone with my thoughts for longer is going to pull me back into badness""

97,"I have been dealing with obsessive compulsive disorder for several years. Consistently since sometime around middle school, my own thoughts threaten me with horrible things like deaths of others or Hell. It has made dealing with everyday things like school much more difficult than it should have been; my grades were shit throughout high school and, frankly, continue to be shit in my classes at a local community college. I went to a doctor recently and opened up about symptoms I hadn't been open about before - it had been a mix of me not knowing how to acknowledge those symptoms and downplaying them. I was referred to a specialist to check for psychosis and they found that what I'm dealing with is specifically _undertreated_ OCD. While I am relieved that it's not a psychotic disorder, it's still a pain to deal with OCD. I will be seeing a specialist soon that specifically deals with OCD; I also hope for a medication change.

The last few months made up my first quarter at the community college. Like throughout most of high school, I managed to severely fuck up the grade of one of my classes and have thus caused my financial aid (through FAFSA) to be suspended for academic reasons. This ongoing trend, caused by a complete lack of self-motivation, has caused me to feel absolutely worthless most of the time. I feel like what I'm doing isn't amounting to anything. This paired with frequent depressive episodes makes me want to stop living altogether, as a feeling of being trapped and worthlessness makes me feel like I have no reason to live, even though it's not true. I have good relationships with my friends and family, but I still almost constantly want to just end my life.",05Jan2020,1
98," I've been trying for quite some time to find out about who I am, what are my strengths and talents and my interests - all within the context of my future work of choice (career).

I am now very interested (and kind of desperate) to engage in some internal self-exploration, contemplation, evaluation... For now, get a good grounding with just pen and paper and thoughts to think through my next step and stop this chaotic direction of my life.

What I am looking for are some tests, exercises, books or papers to help me guide myself to some sensible picture of myself, my personality, my strengths, and talents, my interests... Upon which, later on, I can base off my decisions and really distill my best options going forward.

I need some guidance and help in this journey to get to the desired results and also to help me avoid dead ends, misconceptions, defense mechanisms, my self induced, inauthentic lies and illusions - just in general, all the traps laid in this path that I might fall into once again.

I have read a book A Job to Love (by The School of Life, ISBN: 0993538754) and it alone already help me to move ahead pretty significantly in my ""soul searching"". And it was comprised of some theory about this topic and a lot of exercises. Exercises were the real help to me in this case. Just a few guiding, well constructed (and ordered) questions (which I would have never thought of) and then on my part - a lot of journaling.

Also, our school psychologist had several tests for students who came with this problem to her. I never went to her but from what I heard they were aimed at many areas of intelligence (I guess) - spacial, verbal, analytical. etc... Plus she gave them some personality tests (don't know if Big Five or Myers Briggs or any other). I don't know how helpful or valid her evaluations were but I just wanted to mention this, it might help.",05Jan2020,3
99,"quick backstory: my mother and father are separated. they lived together for my whole life up until i graduated high school when my parents went their separate ways. i ended up living with my mother because it was my father who cheated on my mother (multiple times) and me going with him would be seen as taking his side by most of my family.

let me describe my mother: she is not a well-adjusted individual. her mother was abusive and she is old fashioned to say the least. she has been a victim of domestic abuse in previous relationships before my father.  
i think all the abuse she endured has manifested as a sort of moodiness that constantly keeps me on edge. my siblings are never a victim of her mood swings but i always seem to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.  
i think it's because i remind her so much of my father as she tends to say but i can't be sure because i know discussing my father with her is always a bad idea. she's never physically violent but she always finds a way to belittle or berate me for any of my insecurities she can immediately think of and then say that i'm the one overreacting when i tell her that my feelings are hurt or that she went too far. hence why i do not have a very good relationship with her.

as for my father: i actually don't know very much about him. he's not abusive that much i do know. for most of my life he was just the father figure that showed up in the evenings who would sometimes lecture me for an hour straight because i did something stupid. he's very level-headed most of the time and always finds an opportunity to lecture me about life and how i should be doing more to get ahead while i'm still young. i know he used to be a very good artist but he never mentioned when he started to draw or if he still enjoyed drawing. i also know that he was a smart student and that when he was very young he dropped out of school to get a job and support his family and that's all he's being doing since.  
i used to have a good relationship with my father but recently i've been wondering if he's been manipulating me.

regarding the separation: my father has told me his side of the story several times. my mother didn't do enough to make him feel loved so he cheated on her.  
over and over he's told me that if it weren't for me and my siblings that he would have cut ties with my mother a long time ago. he tells me so often that the whole reason why he stayed and the whole reason why he keeps working more than anything is to support me and my siblings and not for my mother.  
he is married now and he wants me to move in with him and his new family whom i've never met. i don't want to meet them mostly out of spite for how he split my life in half and also because meeting them would split my life even further and would give him more reason to encourage me to move in with him.  
now every time he visits he always brings up the subject of me getting to know his new wife and step-child. i've become so tired of hearing it because i always tell him that i don't want to meet them and he always ends the conversation with ""no pressure"" or ""i don't want to pressure you"". i have tried to tell him that i am uncomfortable with how often he brings it up and that it feels like pressure but last time i tried he laughed it off. he said it would be like me saying i feel pressured by him talking about how he wants to go to the moon so there's no reason for me to feel pressured.

am i overthinking it or am i justified in thinking he may be trying to manipulate me into sympathizing with him? also is there any advice i can get about navigating around my mother's tendency to lash out at me?  
any feedback would be appreciated but please know that i'm in a *very* financially unstable situation so moving out or seeing a therapist is not a very good option for me at the moment.  
thank you!",05Jan2020,1
100,"okay so before I get into what's been going on I'd like to say upfront that I am currently getting treatment for a major depressive disorder and high anxiety, I'm on the medication Lovan (aka prozac) at 60mg and for the first 8 weeks it was working great. 

The most noticeable effect was the little voice in my head that narrates literally every thought or action went quiet, this voice is my voice, and it's like it has multiple personalities it gets sad, it gets angry or jelous but I know that's not me my voice is a good voice, a kind voice. 

These voices have come back and are causing insomnia because I'm overthing everything of a nighttime. 

a little side note is sometimes I hear my parents fighting but in a whisper when it's not really happening, other times voices on a radio.

and when I was young I remember two distinct times of having an imaginary thing appear and try to hurt me but it wasn't a super common occurance. 

can anyone advise me about similar experiences?",05Jan2020,1

It is not unpleasant, I look forward to heating from them every night. However, when I did some research about this I found very conflicting answers. Some say it is normal and other people say that it is an early symptom of schizophrenia. The voices aren't family members, it's like it is another person. Sometimes he starts telling me about gory things which is weird. Any help or insight to this event would be helpful.",05Jan2020,4
105,"Heyyo. Well, this had been brewing for a decade and there were many signs but I was away a lot of the times and mum decided to ignore obvious symptoms because she was scared of her husband being ""crazy"". After he had 2 strokes, an operation due to his diabetes, he got even worse. He is 59 btw. 

In any case, the fact that my father is a schizophrenic got exremely obvious and it has also impacted our daily lives due to stupid stuff he does as well his suspicious spending of money. I feel like many people out there are taking advatange of him. 

&amp;#x200B;

He basically thinks he is a messiah that connects with secret cults/aliens that rule the world and is writing a book about it. 

I have been very angry and distant to him due to his weird behaviour but now I sort of pity him. He used to be a very rational, street-smart fella. He still has that buried in him as sometimes he makes a lot of sense and is trying to lead us to the best lives we can, but his disorganized thoughts are becoming more obvious now. 

When I confront him about him being crazy with a bit of sense of humor, he doesnt even deny it. I sort of feel like he is even aware of his problem but still wants to stick with it or something. 

He used an anti-psychotic at some point but decided to stop using it because he was using too many meds and it made him sad. He stopped that and told me that ""if he gets crazy again, he will use it again"", which he obviously doesn't now. 

Anyways, he agreed to go to a doc with me tomorrow. 

But in the meantime, are there any tips you can give? How can I make things better living together with him? Will meds make him sensible again? What are the odds of me having this disease in the future? I also have a pretty bad anxiety disorder, just like my father in his youth. So it got me thinking.",05Jan2020,1
106,"I (M31) feel as if something bad all of a sudden clicked back into place since the holidays. About two years ago, I found my way out of an abusive marriage (which mainly included psychological, emotional, and sexual abuse) which resulted in two amazing kids. However, as I began to distance myself from her, she succeeded in essentially destroying and isolating me via reputation control, gossip, and manipulation. Since I had not yet sufficiently become aware of the effects of the abuse on me, I let it happen (and even felt it was justified). 

I struggled with homelessness, isolation (both self-imposed and through social alienation), and an increased sense of depression and anxiety. I eventually turned to drugs, alcohol, and self-harm to cope. Eventually, I was formally diagnosed with an adjustment disorder, which was later changed to complex PTSD. I've struggled with suicidality in the past, and through a lot of counselling and work, I got to a place where I felt stable enough to not consider myself at risk. Since then, I've refrained from substance abuse (6 mo. sober), got an apartment and a job.

However, as I mentioned, since the holidays, I've felt as if I'm going backwards for some reason. I've isolated myself from everyone as far as I can manage (even choosing to go hungry rather than leave my room and see my roommates). I have no friends (as I don't feel as if I can trust anyone, and therefore never respond to anyone who actually does reach out). I'm starting to feel more anxious again, to the point of self-harm and more emotional outbreaks. 

The stress is beginning to take its toll on my physical health again as well. When I was first diagnosed, I was given a diagnosis for HPA axis dysfunction, as the adrenaline in my system was causing all sorts of issues. As my symptoms start to reappear, I've also been noticing some other new symptoms as well (such as bloody semen and neuropathy), indicating a potential for something more serious (i.e. prostate cancer). 

I've withheld this information from everyone (including my therapist), hoping that I really do have cancer as a way to do my dirty work for me. It's odd to feel my suicidality creep up again with so much blatant morbidity, but also a strange subtlety. In fact, I felt comfort when I'd think about a potential cancer progressing through my body to a point where I could no longer stop it. I don't want to die, necessarily, but I just don't feel that I have much reason to live - especially since I'm so isolated. 

My love for my kids saved me in previous suicidal episodes, but I'm getting back to the point where I feel that they'd be better off without me, especially since I hold myself in such contempt and with such unconditional negative regard. 

To be honest, I don't know why I'm even posting. I don't care for the attention, and I don't want any emotional connections again (since I only expect for them to hurt). I think I just want these feelings out from me, and I don't know how to do that.",05Jan2020,2

Everytime, my mother and brother discourage me in everything. They think I get motivated because of the anger. Their words are so cruel and they both gang up against me and hurt my feelings. After having enough I start crying. Even when I am crying, they dont apologise, they don't shut their garbage mouths, they just scold me even more for crying. I don't even have the freedom to let my feelings out. They are both (especially mom) so delusional and thet can never agree that it's their fault. They think it's my fault. It is my fault to cry when they hurt my feelings. Whenever I cry, they say that I am way too sensitive to live in this world. I am not. I never cried in front of anyone as far as I remember.

It's not that she's stupid, she just doesn't really think for herself. She has OCD tendencies, calling continually to make sure she has a ride to work(I am her ride on certain days. Another staff is her ride on designated other days) We have to tell her to not call until a certain time or she'll start calling/texting at 7 in the morning and we don't start work until 3pm! I have to pick her up, and she tends to gab(talk) when I really need silence when I drive to work. She was the cause of a panic attack because after I asked her to stop talking, she continued to gab.  I informed her that this isn't going to work out if she continues ( both the dutch person where we got her drink at and my lead worker could tell that something is wrong.

This leads to the house being in a state of utter chaos most of the time. 

I will often have bursts of energy and motivation to clean and organize and I convince myself that I will ""get my life on track"" and ""stick with it this time"" but it never lasts long. I always fall back into my usual habits and struggles and everything falls apart all over again.

When we first got married my husband was so supportive and understand. He tried to be there for me as much as he could when I would fall apart and would encourage me whenever I  was ready to try something again.

But lately, it feels like he's just accepted my failures as the status quo. When I start doing better he appreciates it but he doesn't encourage me. And when I  break down, he seems disconnected like he's there but he's not really there.

I understand how hard all of this is on him and I wouldn't blame him if he had given up hope in me. But I feel like he will never admit that to me no matter how much I ask. 

On the other hand, I have a lot of self loathing all on my own. So maybe my husband does still believe in me and I'm just projecting?

I know neither is good but I've hated myself for a long time.  I am working on it but that's something I can live with. I'm not sure I can handle having him not believe in me anymore. I know I shouldn't rely on what others think of me but he is my rock. He has kept me going when nothing else could. If he doesn't even believe in me any more I don't know what to do.",05Jan2020,4
119,"Hello. I shaved my head.

I look like a kiwi fruit.

But more importantly, I am learning that all my mirror-checking, selfie taking and nitpicking over facial appearance is driving me to deep depressions.

I am a man who struggles with some BDD and just want to know how other people perceive themselves. I’ve never brought this up to counselors before because I didn’t realize how much it hurt to hate your reflection.

Please, I am looking for people’s feedback on how they feel about their reflections, if it doesn’t hurt too much to detail.

120,"[ TRIGGER WARNING: mention of self-harm ]

i [18] feel like im losing my mind... about 2 weeks or so ago, i started hardcore dissociating but this time i got this weird feeling like im living inside of a dream. i remember not being able to feel any emotions, i started experiencing my thoughts in 3rd person (i felt like they werent my own, like i was inside of someone elses head) and i was just.. doing everything on autopilot. i felt so detached. and then i woke up one day and realized that i have a memory gap. went to sleep on monday, woke up and it was thursday. i checked my school's online attendance report and i was present every single day. i found random text messages on my phone but i dont remember sending them. i also found a text file on my pc (sometimes i keep a diary in digital form) that says a bunch of stuff about me ""not feeling like myself"" and ""pushing the stress away"" etc. I don't remember that either. i tried not to freak out about it because i already have a lot on my plate, but soon after that i got into a serious talk with my best friend and i mentioned what had happened and he basically said something along the lines of ""I don't want to sound rude or offend you but that lowkey sounds like bullshit""... that just made me really sad. i grew up being called a liar whenever i confided in someone (in my childhood those were just different family members) and my friend treating me like this really hits.. we've been through a lot of similar stuff like depression and self harm and i thought he would understand... but now im just.. panicking and questioning everything. the ""im in a dream"" feelings returned yesterday and now im scared that this whole shitshow will happen again and that no one will believe me. if anyone knows what to do, please let me know, any help is appreciated",05Jan2020,4
121,"24 y/o male. Right now I am in a very bad place mental health wise. I've been living outside my home country - the United States - for almost 1 1/2 years. Literally on the other side of the world, in Taiwan.

Recently my mental health has plummeted off a cliff.  My mind feels blank, almost nothing provides me with joy, I spend most of the time walking around like a numb zombie, I seem to have zero motivation to do anything, I feel worthless, simple tasks seem extraordinarily difficult because I overthink everything and convince myself I can't do them, I constantly sabotage myself with negative thoughts. These are all things that I've struggled with to varying degrees at different times in the past  but a few weeks ago all of these symptoms of my mental illness/illnesses seemed to come back in full force and overwhelm me all at once. Due to this rapid decline in mental health, I've made the decision to return home and seek further help while I am still covered under my father's insurance for another year and 4 months. I've been seeing a therapist here - she's a fellow American and is licensed back in the states - but I feel like I need more help. 

Yet this decision has provided no relief because I am now dealing with: Feeling like a failure because I'm returning home without having saved up much or discovered what I want to do in life, feeling like teaching didn't work out because I'm lazy and didn't work hard enough to improve, sadness at leaving the friends I've made here and not having experienced many of the things I've wanted to, and most importantly an extreme uncertainty about what I will do upon returning home mixed with crippling anxiety abut possibly never getting better. I feel broken. I feel juvenile and unable to do anything on my own.

I have still have no idea what I want to do in life.  Despite having a college degree, I feel like :

A. I have zero skills

B. Having a year after college where I substitute taught followed by a year and a half teaching English in a foreign country will be completely irrelevant in helping me get many jobs (considering my degree is in communications and I have no internship experience) 

C. I'm too lazy/not driven enough to succeed at anything or improve. 

I want to get better. I want to become motivated and driven. I want to stop spending time always thinking about the negatives and 'what ifs' but instead actually do things. I want to be less of a negative, judgemental person simply because I'm unhappy with my own life. I want to be able to find the joy in the simple things in life and appreciate what I have instead of constantly viewing everything that's ordinary or familiar as 'boring'. Yet I feel as though there is soo much for me to fix and overcome. I have zero clue where to start, and I feel like I don't have the work ethic to succeed at fighting my demons. 

If anybody can provide some advice, link materials to resources that may help, or both, it would be greatly appreciated",05Jan2020,2
122,"as a bi-polar schizophrenic.

i know one of my triggers is love and lust and when the two are together i find myself fighting a fire storm.

i get crazy when im in love its partly why i sometimes run away from it.

or when something threatens it, i try to destroy the very element that is getting in the way.

well... recently i had a bad falling out with a coworker. she was and still is the most beautiful woman i ever laid eyes on.

due to corporate level concerns we both cannot contact each other. whos fault it really is... shouldnt even exist in the first place.

i try to place no blame on the issue and move forward with it, i did blame at first, but that was my natural reaction to handling the emotion of feeling betrayed.

either way I feel comfortable knowing im recovering.

I used to scrounge around the r/unsentletters sub and even posted a few articles for my personal benefit. But i mainly used the thread to throw my mental state in danger.  This sub reddit is highly dangerous for the mentally ill. 90% of the letters are so vague and broad hinting that it could cause a delusional mindset to trigger itself into making a wrong move.

Lucky for me im smart (id like to think) and i kept caution on my mental stability and didnt allow these letters to influence my actions or behaviors. except this one letter i found that oddly resembled an EX's style of writting and the details so close to what i was experiencing. i just wrote down her pet name and my petname in response to it.. later got banned.. but this had in no way or form dealt with the current situation i was going through. with her and i, my emotions felt scattered across the whole unsentletters sub. I literally panicked and thought maybe she had multiple accounts making unsent letters towards me.  

That is how insane my situation was. Lucky for me i didnt do anything misfortunate to my mental health. I breathed. i knew. ive been through this before... the feeling of odd coincidences that seem to be a message from god, when the reality is. Theyre just coincidences. it doesnt mean anything. All i did was smoke some medicinal marijuana and read and fight the delusions off. The buzz i got from smoking really helped cope with my negative emotions and stupid desires to cave into these letters.

Now when i go to read the sub... i feel dissociated to the whole sub. Like nothing connects or seems coincidental. So now i know for sure, i have fully healed from this last demon that i never knew existed until now. The demon of love and lust. I defeated it today. i feel fantastic. i feel as though now i can be attracted to anyone without the discomfort of this demon to come back and haunt me. Although i still want this person back, not my ex, but this new person who came into my life.

do to current circumstances im going to stop seeing other women for a while. This one made me hurt myself in a very strange way. A strange way that i feel only she can heal me through. And so i keep an open scar for her even though she may not want to go back to way things used to be. maybe ill just walk into a new relationship again like i did with her. Just keep minding my business is all i can do atm.

cheers to a new year",05Jan2020,1

124,"hey y’all! 

preface:
okay so i’ve had 3 rounds of ect at this point over the course of two years. first round was 10 times in dec ‘17, second round was maybe 13(?) summer of ‘18, two times in dec ‘18, and this last round i had 18 sessions this past fall in ‘19. i didn’t have memory loss the first time but i had pretty bad memory loss for the second one and the third round. first round worked and for the first time in my life i didn’t want to kill myself—this lasted 6 months but just living without suicidal thoughts was nearly euphoric. the second round last summer didn’t take and i ended up in the hospital dec 2018. the third round i just finished and has worked pretty well tbh.

so my issue is that i’m a student. i have one last semester in undergrad left. my doctor said that a great way to keep the benefits of ect is to do booster rounds. it would mean going and doing 2-3 times a month for a few months and then hopefully 1 time a month after that period ends. theoretically i could start next month i’m p sure. but i’ve never done ect during the school sessions, it’s always been when i’m not in school (winter break, summer break, winter break, a term off) and i’m really concerned about how this will work with my studies, especially in regards to the memory loss aspect. and tbh school is a huge stressor already.

129,"I hate my entire life.

I haven't relaxed at all over Christmas break. Due to my ADD I haven't been able to focus on schoolwork and had to work all over break. I wasn't even given a break on Christmas. 

I'm an artist with a nerve disorder, and I'm struggling to make any money. I'm almost 16 and I know I shouldn't be worried about money but there are some times where I'd like to spend time with friends at the mall or afford Christmas presents for my family and I can't afford anything. All my friends have jobs and have referred me to their bosses, none of whom want to hire me because of my disorder, despite 100+ hours of volunteering and a letter of recommendation. it's mostly stoner 20 year olds that get the job. 

I see people who just buy whatever art and characters they want and they're so young and their parents pay for everything, and I can hardly afford to buy my OCs, let alone get them art by other people.

My parents constantly yell at me for messing up or having my mind wander and it makes me sad that I can't be the daughter they wanted. My siblings are both highly talented and honor roll students. 

It's gotten to the point where I'm nauceous and my head hurts all the time, and I can't make it stop. I don't want to wake up in the mornings, if I've even managed to sleep from the mental &amp; physical pain I'm in.

I hardly even have 'friends'. Most people steer clear of me due to the fact I could possibly be schizophrenic, but at the very least suffer from delusional psychosis. Those who are friends with me only want to hang out once in a while, and never really want to be seen around other people with me. I get bullied a lot at school for who I am and people will even intentionally set off my triggers just to make me have break downs in class. That's not even an exaggeration. It's happened a few times in a couple of classes and they were people who knew what might set me off. 

I'm always telling other people I'm here for them, but when other people offer the same for me I can't let myself be helped because of prior trauma and trust issues, and I'm wondering if my life is even worth living anymore.

130,"Don’t worry, this isn’t a cry for help. More one of curiosity.

I’ve found myself fantasizing about suicide a lot lately. Maybe not fantasizing, more day dreaming. Pondering. Lazy thoughts dancing across my minds eye, you know?

Naturally I quickly snap out if it and realize that’s not the way at all, but those thoughts keep popping up again.

Yes, I am in a depression and yes, I am trying to fight it. But still I often wonder - lazily - about not being around anymore. Sure, one or two folk might be pissed at my passing, but what should I care? Those that would mourn are the ones that jettisoned me into this dark place.

I’ve asked for help a bunch of times. I’ve made it clear what it is I believe that is not allowing me to progress, but still those metaphorical heels dig in deeper and deeper.

My question is if anyone feels the same? Knowing that I’d never do it, but daydreaming about ending the misery once and for all. In the same way you daydream about being Bruce Lee and beating a bunch of bad guys, but knowing it would never actually occur.

134,"Trigger warning : suicide




This might seem like a bit of a stupid question but I don't actually feel like I'm sick enough for immediate attention in comparison to others I know. 
Around this time last year I tried to kill myself, I was sectioned because of this and since have been to multiple different therapies and I'm still currently in therapy. My gp tried to get me in contact with a crisis team but my psychologist said she thought it wasn't necessary because I don't harm myself in crisis therefore ""I'm coping fine"". I agreed because I thought if I'm not harming myself surely I don't need that kind of help? but for the past few days I've been edging closer and closer to wanting to try to end my life again. It started as a crisis but it's a little different from before because before it was an impulsive decision but I've been so calm and collected since the crisis and the thought of it is actually making me feel relief and the more relieved I feel the more I'm actually making plans. I have told two people, one who asked me to go to a&amp;e but I didn't think it was necessary. I don't think how I feel warrants immediate intervention because I feel calm. I also feel like I'd be just wasting their time because I'm convinced they'll just tell me to distract myself and I'll go home feeling the exact same way so it seems pointless anyway. I don't really go to them when I'm in crisis so I'm not sure I'd even be taken seriously because I'm not frantic. 
I don't know what to do, some advice would be helpful because I'm worried that perhaps my perceptions are a bit distorted because of how awful the past few months have been.

141,"Very long post don’t know if I should break it up, post in a different sub, etc. In short I’m dealing with some difficult mental roadblocks that are negatively impacting me, and I just want to a feel of how much of this is normal, and just a part of being a functioning adult. I tied to bullet point some of my key road blocks and them how they impact me (see bold text below)
————————————————————
Mental
————————————————————
Extreme boredom - I have yet to consistently loose interest in my hobbies (specialty coffee, whiskey, cooking, operas/symphony), any boredom typically goes away rather quickly here; but these hobbies don’t take up large chunks of my day. So for the rest of it I just go through the same motions and am bored with the day before it even begins. I even got bored writing this post... It seems mundane things don’t interest me as much, where as something like skydiving has really been intriguing me, the intense rush of adrenaline sounds fun. 

Emptiness - Other than doing my hobbies or spending times with family/friends, I find myself having an emptiness about myself, a general world cynicism and apathy (to an extent). While I can get feel happy/mad/sad at certain events, this is a brief feeling before returning to my baseline. 

Fidgety, wanting to be on ‘move’, kind of like an engine- While I can get into a focused mindset, getting there is tough and seems like I just have to power through the initial boredom, which I cannot do. It also often turns into anger at objects/people when they don’t work/think/move fast enough. I just want them to ‘act’ it get out of the way so to speak. 

**I’m sick of my job, and while I have a math degree finding a job w/out additional training has proven to be a very difficult. But this is where my real struggle begins. Teaching myself a new skill I have to somehow overcome my boredom and fidgetiness - while it’s possible to mange them, getting the task to that point requires the stars to align.**

**But then, “why do something else” this is where my emptiness comes in. I really don’t care about a lot of things, nothing really gets me bumped up. For instance I work as a contractor for GoogleMaps, a colleague of mine loves GMs, he has benefited from it and wants to make it better; me I could honestly care less. So how does one find a new path, a new light in a sea of gray? I’m afraid to make a hobby my primary money earner as then it would be an obligation and no longer a choice, or an escape from the monotony of day-to-day.**
————————————————————
Relationships
————————————————————
Family - see/text them often, good and loving relationship

Friends - not to many friends, but the ones I do have I try to talk/see/go out with as much as I can

Self confidence - I constantly seem to underestimate myself, and question what I know; for instance, even though I have a driver’s license, I’m afraid I’ll get into an accident. 

Self esteem - I was fairly overweight in the past, and now it’s much better. While others say I’m looking good I still see fat (which I actually have, probably ~20% bf). I also have things I cannot change like my voice (sounds stereotypical ‘autistic’ (lack of better word)), or the fact that I have moles/bumps on my face, head, chest.

**Both of the above contributes to me having essentially no dating like what so ever. How can someone like me when there are so many issues? This then turns into a deep feeling of loneliness and a fear that my family (not so much friends) will abandon me (not by choice, but because something happens to them and they die). This feeling, along which many of the above often results in eating food that makes me not feel good as a way to sooth myself, but then it just me feel worse, and this cycle continues, until I can somehow snap out of it. **
————————————————————

How much of this is normal? How much of this is just me not being an ‘adult’ and not ‘man-ing up’ and doing what is needed?

The relationship side of things seem to come in waves, especially after seeing my family for an extended period of time (holiday, long weekend). Where the mental side of things is an everyday struggle.

If you made it this far I appreciate it. I tried to make it as short as possible. I plan to talk to a therapist soon, but wanted to (a) get what is in my head on paper and (b) just get a second opinion on is what I’m feeling ‘normal’ or something that everyone struggles with? before heading into a therapists office",05Jan2020,1

I just got my first diagnosis after 4 years of silent strugge.

I dont know where else to talk about this but i really just want to type it out. Quick introduction: I am a german boy and because of the social healthcare, it takes a really long time to get an appointment to anything regarding mental health. On top of that, when i went to a psychiatrist 4 years ago with my parents, they denied treatment and that made me what i am today.

I have been self-medicating myself with xanax during my major panic attacks that appear once or twice a month. It usually worked out, i calmed down after a couple of minutes. Yesterday, i had my first panic attack that my parents actually noticed. Because they dont believe me, they always think im making shit up so i never told them again. My panic attack was uncontrollable and since my parents havent seen that before, they called an ambulance that gave me some other benzodiazepine. In the hospital, i was then asked to talk about all my issues, and i explained everything. About the panic i usually have during these attacks, how frequent they are, about my depression and all that stuff. Waking up tomorrow morning, i was driven to a psychiatric institution for a first examination and to check if i needed to be put under watch. After maybe an hour of me pouring my heart out, the psychiatrist decided that im not going to be forced into a clinic, so i went back home with my first diagnosis: ADHD, depression with suicidal tendencies, beginning of social anxiety and panic disorder. I dont know what i should do now except talk to my psychiatrist. Im feeling really lost.",05Jan2020,1
144,"This is from an email I sent to a youtuber I frequently watch. Figured it would also be a good question for [r/OCD](https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/).

My question is in regard to my theme and whether it is OCD at all or not.

My theme has been on physical fighting, being attacked, and physical altercations for the last two years or so. I have had OCD off and on for four years. 

Generally in any given day I will obsess over a handful of real events that have taken place in the past. These events will entail someone staring at me aggressively, sometimes cocking their head quickly to me as they pass me in a store corridor, sometimes turning in a restaurant line to stare back at me after I've been staring at them, sometimes having a, ""Hey, you got a problem?"" look. People looking at me like they want to ""start something"" physical because I want to ""start something"".

These events *actually happened*. They are not false memories. They are not hypotheticals. Usually they have occurred when I am in the midst of obsessing and enter a public place with the feeling of hyper arousal, fear, fight or flight. The obsession (if I stare at someone, or even if I don't, someone here will pick up on my body language and vibes and want to fight me, or at least stare back and make it seem like they're feeling aggression towards me) kicks in and I end up feeling a sense of confirmation from the environment. I can't tell if what I'm feeling is real or not. I can't tell what's real and what's not at this point.

Because I've had people stare back and ""size me up"" in many of these real events from the past, it's hard to tell what is OCD distorting my perception and what's not.

Basically, people sizing me up and staring / behaving aggressively = this being something I should be afraid of rather than purely all in my head, OCD. The fact that people HAVE done these things many times validates my fears and anxieties, no?

I do however realize how OCD works. The more I act with fear, do compulsions, analyze, ruminate, reassure, the more I'm telling my mind to generate the perception of people wanting to fight me so I can reassure myself more and be less afraid. But the line between reality and OCD distortion has become very blurred in the last few months, so I need help.

THIS IS LESS ME SEEKING REASSURANCE AND MORE SEEKING KNOWLEDGE OF HOW MY OCD WORKS SO I CAN PRECEDE WITH ERP (exposure and response prevention) THERAPY. 

If this is OCD, my theme has been particularly tricky to figure out, which has lead to it being hard to treat.

I haven't encountered anyone with my particular type of OCD (if it is even OCD) so I want more information. I also just don't know anymore. I feel panic and terror at times. 

This thing, whether OCD or not, generates a sense of isolation and worthlessness. I feel a very real, visceral sense that people want to beat me up and fight me almost daily. This almost always generates the infamous fight or flight response. In response, I feel like I need to address people in public by staring to ""preempt them"" and get to the feared event before it happens out of the blue. I feel like I need to get them to stop. 

The intrusive feeling blares out, ""PEOPLE WANT TO BEAT YOU UP!! THEY ARE THE PROBLEM!! BE AFRAID OF THEM WHEN IN PUBLIC!! STARE AT THEM!! STOP THEM TO STOP THIS AWFUL FEELING!!"" The last thing I want to do is make this post weird and simultaneously ensure no one responds, so I wouldn't get weird unless that is already what I'm feeling daily. 

I'm a fairly normal person. I graduated from a great university. I have an office job. I have friends, a great family, achievements. I go to the gym. I'm extroverted. But I am also 100% in the grips of this obsession and need help. 

The feelings have become too overwhelming to bear, so I need to stop this and get help. When this started a handful of years ago there were only a handful of obsessions. I didn't have to spend more than a few weeks to get out of the brain lock and thought loops those generated. Now it feels all consuming. Like it's everywhere and everything in my reality and feels to be more of who I am than it is OCD.

At times it feels so much like it's not OCD and more like I genuinely want to get into fights and people want to get into fights with me when I'm in public.

I typically obsess over these real events, going over and over them thousands of times, doing compulsions about how the person was only looking and the chances of us getting into a fight are slim. (Anything to reduce the anxiety.) Or I might feel terror because the people in these events obviously stared and turned in line or did something overt and undeniable to indicate their discontent and anger towards me. I then obsess and ruminate that, had I done something differently, the situation could have easily turned physical (given the side of town I was in or given another situational context). 

I think you get what I am getting at. Given these events do entail people actually looking and not made up hypotheticals, how do I know the terror I feel when stuck in an obsessive compulsive spiral is not warranted? Most stories and examples I hear of people with OCD in videos and elsewhere involve things that haven't happened or are less based in real events.

With my events however, it is easy to link the terror and fight or flight I feel to something that could easily happen. Because these events feel like they are just a couple steps away from turning violent. (My mind equates staring aggressively or an overt action such as turning towards me to face me as easily leading to violence.) 

I have many instances from the past two years of people behaving in odd ways towards me. Cocking their head as they pass me on the sidewalk, staring at me in a public place, doing so in an obviously intimidating way. How do I separate real life from OCD? Is this OCD or something else? 

The last four or so months has brought me too many episodes of feeling actual terror than I would like. I know feeling ""fight or flight"" this much isn't healthy or normal. 

How can this be OCD despite it being based on real events? How does this form of OCD function? I'm worried I don't belong on this sub even. I'm not seeking reassurance but rather information on how this could be OCD since I've never heard of anyone having this specific issue.

Thanks for your help!!!",05Jan2020,1
145,"I recently tried to cut ties to my friends when I was having some kind of dissociative/suicidal episode, basically it sounded a lot like a suicide note but they haven't picked up because they thought I meant I simply need a break and will be moving on in life (we've been getting a bit distant lately). However, now I feel really bad that I left on such terms. Should I just let this be and not contact my old friends anymore or should I try to reconcile? Furthermore, if I do reconcile is it wrong to tell them the reason I left was because I was suicidal?

149,"(I'm currently 16) Ever since I was a child I had issues many issues I was cruel mean and heartless I didn't know pain I only caused it.   
I didn't have any real friends I never trusted anyone and I was super introverted and never talked to anyone out of school   
when I was 12 the teachers started harassing me verbally and always accused me of stuff and destroyed me it lasted 2 years I had anxiety and I stopped going to school I never got any support cause my parents never understood and teachers hated me friends weren't even an option for me then after those 2 hellish years I got a school transfer I was put into a problem child class since my old teachers had a lot of stuff to say about me even though I wasn't like that during those times. things were getting better, I had no confidence and I was afraid of the new school. I cut off all my old friends and it was a fresh start, I made a few friends and soon Id regret this decision.  we had a lot in common we had nice chats and I got to talking to them out of school but I never trusted them. soon enough they started harassing me and abusing me verbally and physically for 3 years. my confidence was even further ruined I developed social anxiety and I lost the will to live I had insomnia daily and I went through hell but it was only starting.  
a year later I was late to English class and sat by the only kid that had a spot open next to them, we started talking and we had a lot in common. I got to trust him and I shared with him everything and we were very close. the semester ended and we still talked a lot I got my confidence up and I had will to live again he gave me meaning in life, then the next semester started I was transferred to a new class and it was very difficult for me since I had social anxiety, soon enough this friend of mine stopped talking to me and it was as if I never existed he was mean and disgusting he used me and threw me away. only then I realized I had separation anxiety I couldn't see him with other people while I was completely alone and I stopped going to school and started abusing drugs to fill up his hole i was broken I was in a very deep depression and I had a lot of anxiety and suicidal thoughts.  
until he returned I stopped taking drugs for some time and he heard me out gave me support and love I felt alive again then everything crumbled to shit again he got very drunk I was spotting for him then I started having anxiety randomly so I sat on the side until everyone left and it was only the 2 of us then we sat on a bench and I started breaking down and having a panic attack I tried to ask him for help and I turned to other friends and i was just thrown to the trash everyone I came to trust abandoned me and i'm broken and depressed I'm abusing drugs again this time heavy drugs I cant stop without any support withdrawals are too hard for me to handle alone and I just don't have anyone to turn to and I hate myself and I hurt myself I don't wanna get out of bed and I don't want to keep living like this I don't want to be nice when nobody cares when I'm destroyed. I need a real friend or someone to love and support me my parents aren't an option I'm afraid to be a burden and same thing for my friends I cant stop being sorry and I'm just so done and I could use some help right now I don't think I can walk this path alone again and I need to vent.

155,"I am a 21 year old female. I’ve been struggling with anxiety for about 2 years now. I have constant fear of dying, my family members dying, just a constant state of impending doom. I constantly think something is wrong with me, i’m either having a heart attack, have some weird illness, or i’m losing my mind. I have these feelings nearly every day. I’ve been to therapy and I’ve managed to try to not be medicated for the last 2 years. 

However, it’s starting to impede on my day to day life. My anxiety flares up when I’m alone at night, and I can’t control my thoughts which causes me to stay up at night until 4-5am, or I have restless sleep. This causes me to be extremely tired therefore causing me to be unmotivated during the day, depressed, and feeling pretty worthless. (I also don’t have any traumatic event like the death of a family member that caused this, I just developed it when I moved to university and started thinking about my future, growing up, and realizing I have led a privileged life and that one day, I will face hardships and potentially a traumatic event.) 

I am not looking for therapy or anything or sympathy. I just want to know what your experiences are on anxiety meds? Did they help? I am scared of becoming a “zombie” or losing my creativity and stuff. I’ve tried lots of alternative ways to cope and some have been helpful but I’m ready to look into meds because I can’t keep doing this almost every night. I do have family history of anxiety, most of my mothers side of the family has anxiety as well. So anyways, tell me if y’all recommend medication? How has it helped your lives?

I’ve been mentally ill since I was 11 years old, and probably before that to be honest. Hallucinations, self harm, anxiety, depression, mania, BPD, paranoia, delusions, OCD, insomnia, problems with pharmaceutical drugs, painkillers, etc etc...

I got into lots of criminal things when I was manic at 13/14/15/16, I also went to psychiatric units a number of times between 13-14, then had a child when I was 18 and have tried to hold it together. I had to move back in with my mum, with my partner too. He has Aspergers and found it hard to live with them. I accepted that but needed help. Fast forward 4 years, we got a house. He loves it and I’m so happy that he does. However I feel like I am actually drowning, I can’t cope with every day things, with intrusive thoughts and thinking in the night someone will hurt us etc. I have been having panic attacks every day since Christmas ended. It didn’t even feel like Christmas came. Even when I’m sat there, it feels like the day has whizzed past me and I’ve done NOTHING. I am getting scared all of the time, I stayed in all summer because of wasps and bees and my paranoia was at LARGE. I now have a thing about not wanting my son to step on drains incase they fall. I am so stressed that my chest hurts and I constantly want to burst into tears, but my upbringing taught me not to cry so I try so hard not to, however recently I haven’t been able to help it. I feel like if this carries on, especially after the end of the “fun” season, and back to reality and a summer of bugs and terror for me, I will end up not here any longer. I want to be the best mum I can, my son deserves it more than anyone I know, he is so lovely and just the most amazing little guy.

165,"2018 and 2019 has brought me massive changes and damages. I found myself increasingly lonely, confused, unhappy because of work, relationships and my own avoidance to face the problem. I have started therapy for eight weeks now and I have another four sessions left. I am not sure if therapy will carry on after as I am using the state health care which is free. I realized that I need to work on my happiness by myself. 

I live a very lonely life and at the moment I find Reddit being a supportive community as people do really tell the truth here. I would like to talk about my actions today, and hopefully I will share more about my progress with all of you later here.

After thinking about what I can do differently,m I have come up with the following goals:
1. Focus on self-care - l live a lonely life and i work long hours. I am planning time into my calendar for self-care such as cooking, eating properly, doing nothing and do what I like.
2. Change my attitude - I realized I focus too much on work and take work stuff ultra seriously, which led to massive unpaid overtime and exhaustion, ending up having no time for anything else. I would still do my best in my job but I will take it easier than before.
3. Start learning something new - I am going to commit myself to an online language course. I am going to plan in into my calendar and make time for it. Learning is a way to have better sense of achievement and I think it would benefit me in the long run, in my mental health and my career.
4. Stick to my current work out schedule - I am lucky that I have been going to the gym the last two years so I am going to stick to it. Keeping active did help me in the past two years to sleep better and lower my stress levels.

I am sharing this with you Reddit, hopefully this can be helpful to someone or it might echo with some of you. I am posting this here also because I am signing this psychological contract with all of you that I am going to do this. I am going to be sticking to what i said and reporting to you about my progress.

168,"So I can't sleep more that an hour for 3 weeks now. I have to wake up to go to work at 5 AM and I'll be home around 10 PM. I wanna watch, play and read stuff but I don't have the time. So as soon as I'm home, I'm in my bed. The problems is it takes so long to finally sleep and I wake up after an hour. This is driving me insane. I have blackouts every single hour and I do not know how my days are going on. Like not a single idea. As if I'm sleep walking for most of my days. No memories or anything. But others say I'm normal. I do my regular stuff, say my regular stuff, but it's not me since I have no memory of it. (pls don't be dementia or sth like that.)

I'm not that much of a spiritual/psychedelic man, but I like to try stuff. Meditation or self therapy even. Maybe some psychedelic kinda books to read before sleep? (not the ""you are the same with the universe"" sorta thing. I'm a Tool fan. XD)

Or ways to improve the quality of sleep, if the quantity of hours is not possible. This is hurting the career I need so bad. Coffee is starting to hurt my physically (my stomach is sensetive and I am officially a caffeine addict now) and weed helps but I can't afford it as much as I need it.

My doctor prescribed meds but anything I've tried has given me hang overs the next days and it'll lead me to lose my job and therefore, become homeless. Me not likey.

So yeah. Anything would be of help. Anything. No harm in trying.

174,Firstly some info about me. 16M suffering from OCD for many years but was diagnosed 4 years ago. For the most part it's mainly contamination OCD and Instrusive thoughts but not as much as contamination. I've been on sertraline for the last 9 months due to many things that happened last year including a friend suffering a serious brain aneurysm (he is now a lot better and recovering with only some paralysis on his right side but no cognitive impairment or memory loss) and my brother losing consciousness in front of me which wasn't as bad but still had a negative impact on my mental health. Mainly these two events caused a lot of anxiety to arise conserning mainly my own physical health which eventually led me to medication. For the last few months my bath time has increased from 30-45 minutes to 1-1.5 hours which takes a lot of my time away and it's especially difficult because hot water runs out relatively quickly causing me to spend a lot of time under ice cold water while my parents are pressuring me to be a lot quicker as I am taking way too much time to finish. I've talked to both my psychologist as well as my psychiatrist about it and although they are trying to help me it's still very difficult for me to reduce bath time and i would really appreciate some tips for reducing it. Thanks a lot and sorry if my English is too bad.(also posted on r/OCD)  :),05Jan2020,1

The closest thing i do as a job is volunteer at my local shelter and yes it is called a high stress environment but i tend to take shifts where it is not as full so it tends to be much more quiet and easier for me to do what needs to be done, I tend to focus on the more calm and collected dogs and avoid the more aggressive dogs because i cannot stand the barking at it makes me panic at times. I want to do good and want to lead a normal life but I am just so tense about everything and I am always tired from the very little sleep i get anyways as i occasionally have nightmares. I feel lazy and worthless and get mad that i cannot function as a normal person. I dont like staying indoors anymore because my fsmily gives me a hardtime on the things i cannot do. Believe me i really have tried to function right and do what i can to be better, but i just cant help getting scared at every noise and sometimes i just remember things that throw me into a weird mindset like i am reliving a bad memory.

177,"I need some advise on whether or not I should seek someone to talk to about this. At the moment I feel like my own mind might be making this all up to trick me, and I am not sure why.

I don't know how cohesive this might be, as all I did was write down the things I am experiencing that other people might not find normal.

I am a 23 year old female btw.

So I'm just going to copy/paste what I wrote:

When I am in public I am afraid of someone listening to my thoughts. At times when I believe I have spotted the person who can read my mind, I will spend a majority of that time ‘talking’ to them, trying to get them to leave me alone, and apologising for any thoughts they might have been disgusted by.  I have had this recurring since about 15/16. Sometimes I am suspicious of my friends being able to read my thoughts, but I usually try and talk to them in my head telling them to just tell me if they can.  This causes a lot of anxiety, fear, and guilt.

I believe if I look close enough at my surroundings I am able to make out the shapes of other dimensional beings.  I believe they do exist, and have since I was about 17/18.

I believe sometimes when I dream that they aren’t really dreams, and have a hard time sometimes distinguishing between being awake and dreaming, and vice versa.  Deja vu happens a lot to me, and this also doesn’t help this belief and reinforces this idea.  This used to happen to me when I was younger, and it has been happening a lot in the past year and a half.

I sometimes ‘see’ blocks of static in the air, for about 2 seconds at most, and I feel like that is something to do with the other dimensional beings. This began when I was around 18.

I have been hearing things I know aren’t there, mainly computer noises or phone sounds, and sometimes chickens (yeah idk either).  I frequently hear people say random words very loudly before I try to sleep.

I take 250mg effexor for major depressive disorder, and the last two times my depression worsened I felt belief in these things stronger, and they all negatively effected my depression. Each depressive episode lasted for about four months, and were about 8 months apart.

I have never really spoken to anyone about these things, as I feel people would think I am joking, lying, exaggerating, or crazy.

People know about my depression, and it gets really bad sometimes.  My last depressive episode, I could barely function I would end up on the floor sobbing because everything was so painful, like a terrible grief as if everyone I knew had died.

The reason I am getting concerned and think I might need help is because the other week I was just browsing the internet, and saw a sentence in an article that I felt was targeted directly at me - as in it was written as code for me to decipher, like a secret message. But I know that cannot be true because it was written by a stranger and on the internet for literally anyone to read.

I am worried if things like that begin happening more often, that my next depressive episode will be result in death because I won't be able to be able to tell what reality is.

But I am also incredibly worried that whoever I see will tell me I am making this up, and tell me I’m lying.

What should I do?",05Jan2020,1
178,"Hey so this is my first time making this kind of post, especially on reddit. Idk man, I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve been feeling this way. I don’t really know how to properly express my emotions whether it be on text or in person. I hate that about myself, and I hate saying that “I hate this or that” about me especially in my head so I just suppress it. I suppress any thought that has to do with hate or anything. I have even thought of suicide, and at the same time I am concerned but at the same time I’m not. I open up in my head like I’m saying it to someone but when I do get the chance to talk to someone about it like a friend or family member I just don’t. I am an anxious person, paranoid too sometimes. It’s still Winter break and I had three weeks, this is already the third and I feel like I’ve just wasted so much time sulking, laying down, watching videos on YouTube and whatnot. I’m scared that if I keep this up, I won’t be able to perform my best when I get back to school and form closer relationships with the people around me. Or relationships at all! I just want to be better but... idk... it’s always hard to get my mind off of stuff like this when it happens. This household is so sad, at times I feel like it’s my fault that my parents are so strict or pushy, or it’s my fault whenever my mom complains out loud about how much she has to work, “work at work now more work at home”. My older sister is just staying for three weeks too since she goes to university now, and i don’t know, it seems like she’s not having it either. Yes she has mentioned to me to not ever feel like I am bothering her or that she’s too busy to pay attention to me or listen. I don’t know... I just want someone to listen to what I have to say... I feel like it’s my fault for not having a better or close relationship with my parents as much as i wanted to... but at the same time, they’ve never taken the time to actually sit me down and let me know that they will try their best. My mom isn’t very good at English and she to me, she doesn’t really pay attention to me, neither does my dad. They’re always at work. Along with that, I feel pressured to be the best in school even though I know I can’t because of my anxiety... Mental illness is taboo for Asians, especially the older generation and I remember listening to my dad and sister talk about an author who committed suicide because she was depressed, and my dad just said “It’s because she was crazy.” I’m sorry if this post was all over the place... I just needed to get some of this off my chest and honestly... I’m not okay. I’m finally coming to terms with that. I can’t get through this alone and I’m scared to talk to my dad about this, and it’s kind of hard to when he always seems like he’s in a bad mood. I want to get into therapy because I genuinely feel like it will help, I’ve wanted to tell him about it after him and my mom started arguing (it awfully reminded me of a fight they’ve had before in eight grade: my mom’s blood pressure was high and it got physical, my dad was yelling at me to call the police. I just stood there in the other room shocked because I didn’t know what to do). A lot goes on in my mind, scenarios, random thoughts, just anything. I know I’m not okay but at the same time I feel like maybe I’m just being over dramatic or I’m being a little b*tch. I don’t know... I wish I could just let someone live in my head or my life for a day, I hate explaining myself but I feel like, maybe making some reddit post where some random strangers can see it will help? Maybe understand me too?

179,"I just found out today that my roommate tried to kill herself yesterday. She would've followed through if the method chose wasn't so painful. I won't mention her method but she told me that within the first instant it was so beyond painful that she decided it wasn't worth it. This isn't her first attempt since I've known her, I had to call the paramedics on her when she tried to OD several years ago. She has bi-polar disorder with mostly lows and mixed episodes. She also has borderline personality disorder. So things are rough for her. 

I would push for hospitalization but after the three times she's gone in the last few years (two voluntary, one involuntary) she's adamantly against it at this point. She smart enough to know how to avoid it if she doesn't want to go. I tend to struggle balancing supporting her and looking after my own well being and I don't know how I can maintain what balance I've been able to achieve with this recent revelation. I'm not sure what to do at this point because I can't spend every minute by her side but I'm afraid to leave her alone.

182,"Hello,

I think I might have DID, I am 18M, I plan on making a phone call tomorrow with my family doctor to make an appointment but there are several things that are holding me back from being certain I want to make the phone call. 

It's a long story but just over a year ago, I finally realized that something wasn't right mentally. I first told my mother, at the time I suspected I had anxiety or depression. I always new I was a pretty sad person in general but it took me until then to bring it up to someone in my family because I don't trust my family for other reasons I would rather keep private. Upon hearing my concern, my mother immediately shut down my concern and said I didn't need to see a doctor.

Months later I'm moved out and on my own, now that my mother isn't too involved with my life it gave me a lot of time to think about myself, I spent a lot of time googling questions about some mental symptoms I've been experiencing, drawing conclusions to some crazy mental disorders I probably don't have. I visited a psychiatrist and after telling him all of my concerns he said I had ADHD, which I agree with. Most of my symptoms that have been affecting my life are non-ADHD related.

Every disorder that google matched to my symptoms didn't quite sound like me, until finally, just a week ago I found dissacoiative disorders, a little bit of reading and DID matched the symptoms I was feeling perfectly. Several months of googling and I feel like I finally found it.

Now that we have a potential answer, I'm afraid to bring it up with my doctor because my psychiatrist says I had no other disorders but I'm convinced I have DID, I'm eager to find out for sure so I can work out a plan to cope with the symptoms that affect my everyday life.

So my question to you:
How should I bring up this issue to my doctor? Or should I go a different way about it?

Sorry if this is the wrong community, still new to reddit. Thanks!",05Jan2020,1
183,"Hi everyone. I wasn’t sure if I should post this in the medical sub or this one, but my question is mostly about being emotionally supported. 

I’ve had a tough year with all kinds of physical symptoms that my doctors are trying to piece together to come up with a diagnosis. This year, I suddenly became anemic. I’ve been struggling with feeling like fainting, dizzy spells, constant nausea, dull feeling in stomach almost every day for 3 months now. I almost fainted a few weeks ago when I was out with my bf. My gastro is trying to find source of bleeding/cause of anemia. They did an endoscopy and found mild gastritis/hiatal hernia but neither could be a cause of bleeding. Next I’m doing a CT to look for cancer and ulcers. 

This has all been so debilitating that I can barely go out bc im scared I’ll faint in public and generally just feel really sick. My bf has been supportive but I can tell it’s frustrating for him. I’ll preface all this by saying he got me pregnant by accident in Sept., I had a miscarriage wherein I bled for 3 weeks. That could be the possible cause of anemia, but we are trying to rule out more serious problems especially since I have all these gastrointestinal symptoms. 

Anyway, I live with my mom and she is the most insensitive person alive. She has told me multiple times that it’s all in my head even though my blood tests show a legitimate problem. I’m starting graduate school in July and was thinking about staying at home to save money but I really want to move out, even if I blow my budget on housing. My mom is totally unwilling and unable to change. I’m living in a toxic environment. However, she is struggling to pay the mortgage and expects me to contribute rent money when I start grad school. If I move out, she will probably lose her house. She has made it very clear that if that happens because I move out, it will be all my fault. I can’t be dealing with this as I need to do well my first year in order to land a good job when I graduate and be able to get my entire family out of poverty. It’s too much pressure. 

Should I move out anyway? How can I get through this rough patch with my health with no support? Should I feel guilty if I move out and contribute to my mom’s financial ruin?",05Jan2020,1

School starts back tomorrow, and I’m a first year teacher who struggles with their mental health. A couple of weeks ago I was nearly involuntarily  Hospitalized by my therapist. I would post on one of the teaching subreddits, but the advice goes 1 of 2 ways: quit—your mental health isn’t worth it or quit—you aren’t cut out for this. I feel inadequate and like I am failing my students all the time. Those thought have been  a fixation for me, they are intrusive and defeating. I get stellar reviews from my principal  and neutral to positive ones from my students. On paper, my job is really the easiest in the school and I think I am capable of one day being amazing at it, but for now all I want to do is escape.

187,"I apologize if there is spelling errors in on mobile.

I’ve been married for five years to a really wonderful man and I’m also diagnosed bipolar II. To sum this up in a nutshell I, for reasons unbeknownst to me, do things to create situations that result in me trying to hurt him. I will push and push and push until he reacts and I go into almost a black out where I can’t control my actions or what I say (I have also been physical) I don’t even know why I do this and when I come back down to earth I just sit there and wonder why I just snap into this awful human-I’m in a complete daze and I’m zapped of all energy, like I ran a marathon. He’s stayed with me through it all but I can tell it’s completely ruining him. He told me he loves me enough to put up with this for the rest of his life; however, he’s completely defeated and I’m so sad but yet I can’t help it. I just have to fuck everything up. 

I also have paranoid delusions that he’s died when we aren’t near each other. Every morning he has to call me to let me know he’s made it to work (he has about a half hour drive). If he’s more than five minutes late or doesn’t answer his phone I seriously panic and lose control. I love him so much that the though of not having him might as well just kill me too-yet I continue my patterns of making him miserable. 

I’m 31 and I still deal with narcissistic parents, especially mother. I know deep down almost all of my issues stem from mental abuse-paranoia, gaslighting, guilt trips, anger issues. I’m just concerned this is more than bipolar (which I take medication for). I used to do rituals as a child to prevent bad things from happening and I had intense anxiety and was bullied. I also had trouble controlling my behavior in school and didn’t do well. As an adult I can control myself I suppose and have a decent job (though I’ve been fired from countless jobs in my early 20s for behavioral issues). I can’t afford to go see a therapist but I’m just at a loss for why I am the way I am. Why do I completely lose control and almost black out. Why can’t I control anything about myself. Why do I sabotage the person who takes care of me.

The time there was quite tough. It was kinda fun, I was 17 (turned 18 there) so I was at the children’s hospital and there were always such lovely nurses who would play games with you and distract you. But there were awful times. One time they wanted to examine my stomach so they wanted to do a gastroscopy. Would they wouldn’t do it without anaesthesia. But since I was so underweight, the weight alone was life threatening. Anaesthesia could worsen it. I panicked. My parents wanted the doctor to do the gastroscopy, but since I freaked out and cried they said they don’t want to force me. I felt so helpless. It was extremely scary. So they set one the next day so I’d have one night to think about it, and the next day I could decide weither I do it or not. I ended up doing it, I didn’t sleep much but I have to say I am proud that I did it. I knew if I said I’ll do it some day later I’d never have done it. So I just had to. Earlier today this situation of me lying there in my hospital, freaking out over the anaesthesia and the fear cake over me again, for no reason. I started crying again. It was horrible.
