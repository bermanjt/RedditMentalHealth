This thing has recently been on my mind about my girlfriend of one and a half years. She will cry during movies, a lot - but it always seems to be about herself. For example we watched Her, and she cried a lot at the end and said that main character is so lonely and she doesn't wanna be alone like that when her parents die. Or we watch Togo and she cries again, this time she said it reminded her of her pet cat dying... and on and on, always in the end she connects it to her.

I'm very emotional too, and movies often leave me teary eyed, but I always feel for the characters, I feel sad for them, or like I wanna help them or something..  

This thing is just one of the plenty of things kinda making me worry, although I keep telling myself I'm probably imagining it. 

She gets very very sad if someone says or thinks something bad about her, and she has incredibly low self esteem. Yet she hurt me in the past and seemed to be fine with it until I reacted hurt. Is this some sort of empathy disorder or just nothing out of the ordinary?",25Jan2020,1

2,"Hi Everyone,

I wanna start off by saying my mother has always been a very giving person. Sometimes well beyond what is expected from her. The last few years she has fallen into a bad depressive state. She just recently recieved a diagnosis/meds. She feels very ashamed of this because she has always seen herself as strong and surpassing every obstacle that she has faced but she hates struggling with something se feels she has little control over.

I check in on her everyday, go to dinner with her when I can, and am always reassuring her. She feels like she is a burden to those who she reaches out to, including me. I reassure her that it is not burdensome but it doesn't hit her that way. I'm just afraid of her giving up. 

Any advice when talking to her? I never know how to handle the times she calls upset.",25Jan2020,1

4,"I’m a student, in my third year of university. I’ve struggled in social situations for as long as I can remember but never thought of it as that unusual till I got to uni. Around this time last year it got really bad, I had no close friends, was miles away from everyone I knew and so lonely. I somehow managed to get the courage to go to the university counselling centre. 

I worked with a counsellor there for around 4 months. In some ways I felt it helped, but not enough. I was finding it too difficult to share my true feelings, petrified of being judged. My counsellor would never have judged, rationally I knew that, but I could never get the words I needed to speak out of my mouth. 

Now I’m back in my home country, living with my family again. I saw my GP back in November and started Sertraline (Zoloft) and an online therapy program to help with my social anxiety. I didn’t see a change until my dose was put up to 150mg when I felt a little better. I was able to make small talk with a cashier without freaking out and running it through my head for days after. I felt better for about a week, until Uni started up again. I have a group of friends at Uni, I really enjoy spending time with them and genuinely like them but I always feel a bit disconnected. They enjoy going out to pubs and nights out and given that they all know it is not my thing, I rarely get invited. During classes it’s great but then I get home and have no-one to speak to till classes the next day. 

I also have new classes this semester. I’m usually a high-achieving student but I’m struggling already. One of my lecturers just frankly terrifies me. She asks lots of questions to specific people in class and even though I was reassured that she would not ask me, I can’t shake the feeling she might. She also goes around and stares at your work and it stresses me out so much. While my Uni friends were probably aware I had a bit of anxiety before this (I’m not big on sharing it, but it can be obvious if you know me), they now are fully aware. I can’t breathe in this class, my heart starts racing, I go pale, I keep shaking and I’m always on the verge of tears. If the subject matter were not so difficult I likely would skip the class, but that is a sure-fire way to fail, one of my worst nightmares. 

Every night when I come him I feel really down and tired. I unloaded a bunch of this on my best friend (who lives somewhere else) the other night and though she reassured me that she didn’t mind and wanted to help me, I feel like such a bad friend. I’m feeling very vulnerable right now. I’ve never had this many people aware of my mental health and it scares me. I’m so tired of everything right now. I feel like a failure for being unable to keep up in classes, a loser for being so scared of a class, a bad friend for putting so much on my friend and lonely.

I know I could solve some of these problems by getting work done before deadlines and keeping on top of things but right now I have so little motivation. I get home, I nap and lie in bed till its night time then attempt to sleep for hours (when my thoughts turn more and more self-critical) till I eventually fall asleep and restart the cycle. 

I want to be someone different, someone who is more than just a member of my friend group, someone who is actually important to them and doesn’t always just feel like they are tagging along. I want to be less stressed about Uni, I want to be able to go to this class without feeling like I’m dying a little every time and even if I have to feel like that, I wish it wasn’t obvious so I wouldn’t make anybody worry about me or even worse feel pity for me.

Just had to get this all off my chest. I’m so tired.",25Jan2020,1
5,"My name is Craig Miller, and I am a counseling psychology doctoral student at Marquette University. I am seeking participants for a study examining client perspectives on failure in psychotherapy or counseling. 

Very little is known about how clients experience failure in therapy, and I am hoping this study will make a meaningful contribution in improving client care. Participants will be asked to describe their experience of failed therapy and what factors may have contributed to the failed course of therapy. 

Participation in the study includes completing a demographic form and participating in a recorded telephone interview lasting approximately 45-60 minutes. All information shared will be kept confidential. This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of Marquette University.

To participate, you need to be at least 18 years of age and have had a previous course of individual counseling/therapy, lasting at least 3 sessions within a 2-month period, that you consider to be a failure. 

If you are interested in participating or have further questions about the study, please email me at: [craig.miller@marquette.edu](mailto:craig.miller@marquette.edu)

6,"I've only just joined reddit so I'm not 100% sure what I'm doing or if this is even allowed, if not just delete but I'm saying this anyway.

So recently I started researching serial killers and became apsaloutley drawn to Jeffrey Dahmer. He's a serial killer who murdered and dismembered 17 males.

I.. have read a lot of posts about it being disgusting to glorify &amp; sexualise serial killers, and I totally understand. I'm not trying to excuse the acts of what he did, but it kind of excites me which actually scares me. I've seen his Polaroids and I've watched his interviews. It's like having two sides or people inside of me. Which I don't understand and is why I'm posting this.

One side is going ""oh my god, i just want to hug him, and talk to him and he's so handsome and I'm gonna act on these dirty thoughts about him"" and the other side of me is like ""... stop, he's killed.. like literally KILLED seventeen people."" Despite telling myself this everyday I still get obsessive thoughts about him daily, from when I wake up until I go to sleep. I hate it but I'm still sexually attracted to him. 

So he killed 17 people. 17 people who had families that loved them. But I feel nothing. Ive seen a video of one of the victims family members getting visibly upset at the trial but i didnt feel anything, i felt bad for him instead which baffles me. When I looked at the Polaroids...I just can't get my head around the fact they where a son, a person, a living thing at one time on this earth which only prolongs my problem. I don't really have emotions, I lost a lot of people the last few years and I lack empathy. When someone dies I'm just like ""get on with it,  they are dead and there is nothing you can so about it"" and I've never felt truly upset about loosing anyone. I've never felt fear or upset for loosing anyone. I didn't cry when people I love died. I just went about like a normal day and cringed at all my other family members. I hate crying. I hate it. Hate. Which is probably why what Jeffrey Dahmer did dosent disgust me
... It does disgust me, like a literal dead bod... but it also dosent. The fact that he DID SOMETHING SO BAD makes me feel so attached and attracted to him LIKE... why.

I opened up about my desires to people around me, friends. And all I got back was, ""oh my God nah its fine lol"" and ""oooh! Ted bundy was so hot he could murder me!!!"" And I just- I don't think that makes it any better?!?! 

I've always been attracted to ""dangerous"" or ""horrible"" kinds of men. I hate it. Some examples are only fictional characters. Pennywise (yeah, oh god what?) and Michael Langdon from AHS. Pennywise is a murdering child eating clown and Michael is literally Satan himself. And those i was fine with. I have pictures of them in my room, I read faction on them and I have merch. But it's got to a point where I like someone who actually killed people. A murder. A psychopath. A disgusting person. 

Why can't I see it? Why? Why do I keep getting all these thoughts about him? Do I need a therapist? Am I crazy or normal? Is this disgusting? Maybe I'm just disgusting and deranged.

7,"I have huge anger problems and depression often mixed with suicidal thoughts, before I started smoking weed I had 3 nervous breakdowns that I can remember, I attempted suicide countless times and I flew into blind rages at school in front of my classmates at the drop of a hat. The medication I was but on didn't help but As soon as I started smoking weed all of those problems almost entirely went away, I thought it cured it but now that I don't always have some (or I get alot of stuff that is no good) and I realized if I go long enough without it all those problems come back in full swing. It's been three weeks now and I've been flying into blind rages at random without anything to provoke it and I've just had a negative outlook on almost everything including myself and life in general. I feel horrible knowing weed is the only thing making me normal and happy and I can't always have it on me so now I'm stuck with extreme mood swings and I have no idea how to cope with it.

8,"I've been trying to make myself happier and improved my self-image for the past 2 years and at this point I'm like 100% sure that my issue is psychological and not just ""oh you need to believe in yourself"".

Every time I feel happy and/or confident, it's only for a few days and then it's back to a shitty self image because maybe someone didn't want to go to a beer with me or someone said something slightly insulting to me or maybe because I tripped over a puddle and questioned my life's value because of that.

Every advice I've read about anxiety / shyness / bad self confidence is usually somewhat helpful and reassures my life's value but then like a day or two later it's like I never even read it or just find another excuse as to why it's not true.

9,"-I am 24 years old 

-I might as well call myself unemployed since I only work three hours a week

-I do attend graduate school online but there are some complications that forced me to put my education on hold until September of this year

-I only have two friends IRL but we hardly get to see each other much because you know.....we’re adults, and we have other responsibilities 


-I am single. I have had a few dates and a couple of online flings but that’s just about it. Hell, I’ve never even got to hold hands with anybody or kiss anybody. This is probably due to the fact that I have Turner Syndrome and Traumatic Brain Injury. Not only that, I always alienated myself from others due to misantrophic tendencies that I formed due to a volatile relationship with my mother. For all of these reasons, I have never really learned to properly socialize and tend to put people off. Now I that I am getting over the aforementioned misanthropic tendencies, I want so so so badly to find a romantic partner who will stand by me, kiss me, caress me, and cuddle with me while watching a good film or Fire Force. My heart is practically aching for it!!! I am actually developing a concept for an anime series and one of the subplots consists of two misunderstood people who find comfort in one another, fall in love, and just when they think they found someone they can trust/provide them with relief......they discover that  are on the opposite ends of the celestial war that takes place in my story. As I managed to think about all the beautiful moments that these two characters spend together and the immense passion/devotion/love between them, I can’t help but want that for myself..... :(

10,"I never posted on reddit before and im not entirely sure why i'm doing this, but i've always found it hard to search for exactly what has happened to me and any clues are welcome!

Since I was around 13/14 I became (for lack of a better word, i try to avoid self-diagnosing now) extremely depressed. I've tried tracing the source of this and got maybe multiple options and causes, but i digress. At the same time this was happening, I began hearing ""whispers"", as i like to call them, due to the fact that to this day, I'm not entirely sure what this might be. Said whispers never seemed to be coeherent, you could catch a few words (maybe?), but the rest was just incompreehensible mumbling. This terrified me and always seemed to happen at night. This problem was also usually accompanied by weird twitches in my head? Everytime i heard these whispers or seemingly out of nowhere, it was like my head suddenly wanted to twitch and turn around everywhere. I'm not sure if these things were all my imagination or real, I know for a fact that my head twitched (and still does, thankfully very rarely now) and that i felt absolutely miserable. I would also like to point out that i've always had some kind of fixation on characters, and creating them for myself, constantly daydreamed about them. Such characters would often be associated with what was happening to me mentally at the time. I don't know if they have anything to do with it, but i felt like it was important to add.

This lasted to about 2017. From 2016-2017 this problem only worsened, since i was in a ""tricky"" relationship that almost made me make a big mistake. I can recall a very specific night where i could clearly hear someone say ""Come with us"" or ""come with me"". I think i heard some other phrases but that's the only one i can really remember. At this time i also felt some unknown hands pushing me to the inside of my bed. I've been told this can be sleep paralysis? I'm still not sure. During this time i also created a very specific character that i daydreamed almost throughout the entirety of the day and i couldn't distance myself from her (and i still find myself doing it very often).

Thankfully my mental health has never been better now and i'm the happiest i've ever been in a few years. But i would still love some suggestions as to what this might be, since i'm terrified of going to a therapist and don't feel the need to do so now, due to my healthy mental state. Could this be all fabricated in my head or some type of serious issue? Again, any tips would be appreciated.

TRIGGER WARNING: Survivors of murder-suicide

In 2018 I became a survivor of murder-suicide.

Facts were written in the media, case files, autopsy reports and death certificates. They were illustrated with crime scene photos and national news headlines.

Breadcrumbs of truth built the narrative for me, never telling the full story.

There are 11 murder-suicides each week in the United States, often in military and veteran communities. Why aren’t we talking about this publicly beyond sensationalized headlines that don’t help solve the problem?

The lack of support, information, and humanization led me to believe nobody *should* be talking about it. I felt voiceless and carried significant guilt and shame because of the stigmatized circumstances.

I’m taking back the narrative. As a survivor of murder-suicide, I am more than a murderer’s daughter.

I will add to the national conversation on mental health and veteran post-traumatic stress disorder. I hope my story will educate the public and help survivors of this type of tragedy to know they are not alone; the shame is not theirs to carry as they navigate their complex journey.

If you are a survivor of murder-suicide, or know somebody who is looking for support, please connect with me here on reddit. I am connecting with researchers and fellow survivors to reduce the stigma on this awful experience, and help other survivors. I am committed to taking my experience and turning it into a force for good to help others.",25Jan2020,1

I cut myself last night and I can't wait til everyone goes to bed so I can cut again. The urge is so strong. They usually are. I have urges to burn shit, too.

￼”Take a piece” she said to me, 
“I promise I’m your friend “
Calmness, peace, and happinesss, 
no doubt a true godsend

“Anxiety’s my middle name,” I said,  
“I don’t know who I am”  
Life has been so hard for me  
And this stuff is my jam

She said she’d never leave me  
But she wanted me to die  
I had a life my future bright  
My head stuck in the sky

Her blanket sewn by satan’s hands  
Stayed draped around me tight  
She held me close 
and whispered soft  
(Stay here you’ll be alright)

They taste so good I couldn’t stop  
It’s one it’s two it’s three  
False confidence and slurring words  
Why can’t she leave me be?

She took my pep she took my step  
Is this what they call death?  
I’ll have you know there was a time  
She even took my breath

I ran to him and told him  
Thinking he won’t understand  
I hurt him worse than she hurt me
That was not at all my plan

He’s crying in his room alone  
It’s taken an extreme  
The man I loved so deeply  
Felt like nothing but a dream

I wish he knew the pain I felt  
When looking in his eyes  
See that’s the thing that stupid bitch  
She taught me how to lie

But what went wrong? 
I asked myself  
How did I get so lost?  
I never loved myself enough
So now I pay the cost

That precious brown haired little girl  
Her big eyes filled with tears  
What’s wrong with me? 
She thought all day  
So different from her peers

Why do I care, why do I feel  
This shit is way too much  
They’re mean to me, I’m way too fat  
I couldn't eat my lunch

My tears turned into anger  
And my anger soon to rage  
I’m done with xans I swear I am  
It’s time to turn the page

Since then I’ve told them everything  
Thank God for honesty  
Her knife’s no longer in my back  
(She left me there to bleed)

But hear me out, I lost control  
I didn’t have a choice  
She said she’d be my closest friend  
Then robbed me of my voice

I kicked her to the curb  
And while her damage is still done  
I’m stronger with-out her, you see  
I know she’s not the one",25Jan2020,1
37,"I've had pretty intense anxiety since I was young. And for all of my teenage and adult life - I've had depression and PTSD. And its been pretty ridiculous for a while now, I've been having ""waking up screaming in the middle of the night"" night terrors since I was 13. Im now 21. It's getting to the point now that thinking about having to deal with this bull the next 60 years of my life, I'd honestly rather just die. I never would, my family keeps me going but living like this makes me feel like I'll never be content. I don't want to be happy, I just want to go to sleep. I just want to not be a burden to my family. I want to be able to drive down the highway and not almost choke on my puke cause I can't control my own mind and fuckin relax. 

Moral of the story - should I get anxiety meds? I really don't want to but nothing's working.",25Jan2020,1
38,"I feel like I’m looked down on because of the things I’m sad, angry, and stressed about. People have been through so much worse than me, yet here I am contemplating suicide. 

I grew up lonely with no friends because I was homeschooled. And I’m very awkward socially. 

On top of this, I’ve had trouble with what I believe is ADHD. I have many symptoms of it. 

I’ve been stressed about not being able to get the help I need for these things. And not being able to pay for other things such as fixing my rotted teeth, speech therapy, therapy, and an ADHD diagnosis.

And This next thing is something I feel really stupid about, but also really hate my parents. I feel stupid because they’ve been financially supportive. They’ve bought me the things I needed or wanted growing up. They bought me a car, and a then different one because the first one didn’t work out. And just spoiled me with things growing up. So I’m thankful for all that. I’m thankful for all the financial support. 

But there is mental abuse that I can’t forgive them for. My dad cheating on my mom and threatening to leave constantly, the few times my dad threatened to beat me, my mom saying hurtful things to me, being manipulative(I think), them doing questionably sexual things in front of me. 

And overall, they were not very supportive emotionally. They think that I’m just lazy or that “I just want something to be wrong with me”. 

I hate them for all these things, and no matter how hard I try I can’t forgive them. 

And I also just graduated school, and I live far away from town. So I can’t get a job just yet. I have to get my drivers license. Which I’m in a process of getting it. And then be able to get a job. From there, I hope to move away, and distance myself from my parents. And pay for all the things I need, like the therapy and all that stuff. I really just want to get away from my parents. I hate them, and I feel like there nothing I could do about it.

I feel like a I’m just a spoiled brat for feeling this way. I feel like everyone looks down on me for it because they’ve probably been through worse or something like that. I’m scared to go get help, when I am able to afford it, because I’m afraid I won’t get taken seriously. I feel like nobody takes me seriously because I’ve been privileged financially, and had everything that was supposed to make me happy, but I’m not.",25Jan2020,1
39,"So im 18 years old and I think I might be suffering from some sort of mental condition. The reason I believe I might be mentally ill is the way I react to certain scenarios and old started feeling like there might be something wrong when my friend moved into my house with his girlfriend. At first everything seemed to be going well, I mean we all got along and had a good group dynamic going. But for some reason I tend to get to invested in there lives and would feel bad or angry whenever they do things without me even though I know its irrational to feel this way I still just get to upset and take it out on them and claim something along the lines of they don't like me and that's the reason they exclude me even though they show me immense amount of care and support. Its gotten so bad to the point where I started hovering over them while they just do there daily routines, I also don't find a lot of joy in pleasure in doing average things like sports,games,music, and just things in life in general I tend to only feel happy when I have some sort of company or if I'm fighting someone. I didn't really have a lot of friends or outside interactions with other people besides my parents growing up and I feel like this might be a contributing factor to this problem. I also have a lot of unhealthy habits that I want to shake, but always seem to lead no where whenever I try to stop them. A good example of this is smoking I chain smoke about two packs of cigarettes a day and if I don't have a cigarette I also get irrationally mad and all this getting mad for bullshit has led to unnecessary violence. I got in a lot of fights when I was going through my high school years which I always tended to start with random people at that sometimes I did it to blow off some steam and other times it was just for the enjoyment of it. These actions got me expelled from the school in general, but I cant understand why I feel so hostile and bad at random moments knowing that its stupid to feel that way without any justification and the littlest reasons. I would go to a therapist with these issues, but my family is lower class and money been tight. The only reason I decided to go to the people of reddit is because recently i've just been having more and more thoughts of violence on random people or even the people that are close to me and since I can't get any professional help I'm hoping someone here will be able to help me.",25Jan2020,1
40,"Ok I know it's not good to self diagnose and that I should talk to my doctor, therapist or psychiatrist but basically all I've gotten from them is vague answers or that it's not that big of a deal. So here I am.

So not everytime but a lot of the time, I get very nauseous when I eat. I don't know why but it just happens. I also am a very picky eater anyways so it's really hard to find food that I'll eat. Even food that I want to eat makes me nauseous. Tonight for dinner we made breakfast for dinner which is my absolute favorite. I love breakfast food, and we got some really nice bacon and we had avocado toast and eggs and even quiche! I was stoked, and I'm thinking I'll actually eat a full meal! I have a very small appetite also so I was very excited because I can usually eat more of foods that I like. A few bites in and I already am feeling a bit gross. I figured I would push through and ignore it but it didn't work.

I am so upset. This was a meal that I was super excited for. I'm at the end of my rope with this.

TL;DR - I have a very small appetite and I get nauseous when I eat, even with foods that I like. I almost never want to eat, even when I'm hungry",25Jan2020,1
41,"So I’ve been intensively working on my mental health for the past year, generally treating it for the past 3 years. I’m a college student (22) and last semester was incredible for me compared to previous semesters. (Hope I don’t sound like I’m bragging, I’ve just worked so hard and feel genuinely happy for the first time in a long time- I hope you all get there soon too!) 

My friend (21) who is also my roommate has also struggled with their mental health. Everyone’s MH is different and I try to be cognizant of that. I’ve always had a hard time with them because their anxiety is taking things like having crushes on boys and partying and taking them to the extreme. They genuinely get worked up about it, and they need constant reassurance. Many of our conversations are me telling them how great they are, no that person doesn’t hate you, he’ll text back eventually, etc. I am completely aware how I am judgmental of these things because I know for me my anxiety comes from “larger” traumas and I wish it was as “simple” as theirs. I never express my judgment to them though, I truly do believe in validating their feelings. 

After a while, it got to a point where constantly catering to my friend’s anxiety was tiring for me and took a toll on my MH. They are incredibly sensitive and I knew they would take it the wrong way if I said that I couldn’t help them anymore. So I guided them to other resources for certain issues and made it clear I wasn’t the best person to talk to about certain things. (For example I am queer, they are straight and therefore I am of no help with straight relationships) 

It didn’t work as well as I wanted, and so I started using more non-verbal cues to let them know I was not available for them to vent to. (Before if I was watching a tv show I would take off my headphones and listen, vs then I would acknowledge what they said and go back to watching my show. They would then go and call people and see who would listen to them)

Anyway, they were away last semester. And now they’re back and in all honesty I kind of forgot how they were. They are already starting to take a toll on my MH a few days in. I love living with them but the constant anxiety emanating off of them rubs off on me. 

I’m afraid of bringing this up. First of all because they are incredibly sensitive. Secondly I am afraid that it will upset them and I will look like an asshole for saying “Hey I’m doing super well right now and I’d like to keep it that way and your bad energy is ruining it” (obviously I would not say it like that and I have become very good at phrasing things to help with their sensitivity). 

If you’ve struggled with your MH, been in a good place, and then been surrounded by others still struggling, what do you advise I do? How would you handle this type of situation if you were in my shoes?

They are a great friend and I love them dearly. If they weren’t then I would’ve just politely cut them out. I’m completely at a loss and I really, really don’t want my safe space to be drowned in negativity. Thank you all.",25Jan2020,1
42," 

Like people try and scope me out and try and mindfuck with me in an aggressive way.

I think some therapist said that I ""shouldn't play video games"" since I ""look smart"". i don't even know what that means. and why does ""looking smart"" even register. He just had it in his mind to try and mentally fuck with me, and get some rise out of it.

nobody else gets mentally fucked with - so neither should I.

&amp;#x200B;

and lately, some woman in a store kept on saying ""where is your sets? I know you get issues at work with that. It's best to let things lie and not have the sets faze you."" I work from home currently, and i have nothing there remotely about ""sets"". So one time I just told her to f-off and never went back. there are plenty of other places I can buy snacks, milk, or drinks, so i didn't care. Her intent as a shopowner was just to fuck around with me - a stranger - or kicks. HOW SAD.

I told a therapist this, and she said that why would these people gain satisfaction from this. I said that people can do bad stuff. She said that was true, but then it's not necessarily as random as this.

I'm just venting - i'm tired of people trying to mindfuck me. It doesn't happen to anybody else - so leave me the fuck alone.",25Jan2020,1

44,"LONG POST AHEAD. 

Im a guy (21) doing my army conscription and am still living with my parents cos in a country where people live with their parents even to their late 30s.
I think i have a strained relationship with my brother (31), also living w our parents, and my dad (60). My dad was a pretty strict man who ended up physically beating my brother alot when he was younger. My brother on the other hand really yearns for my dad's approval on everything. My brother and i have a 10 year gap and we have another brother(23) who is 2 years older than me, 8 years younger than the oldest. So this 23 year old bro and i have a pretty good r/s because of the small age gap while my eldest brother and i not so. Because my brother yearns so much for my dad's approval in everything, there tends to be alot of arguments that happen between my dad and him. These arguments can get really bad and both of them would start shouting and screaming at each other. When i was younger, i would usually just stay in my room and not do anything until it was over but eventually they kept telling me that whenever theres an argument going on im not telling them what i think about it and that i should not keep quiet in these situations. But to me these were coping mechanisms. I eventually tried to voice my opinions and thoughts when arguments arose and one day i just snapped and just started screaming for everyone to shut up. I started hyperventilating and couldnt think straight. I would huddle to a corner and wouldnt be able to have anyone come near me as i felt really scared and paranoid. I believe these were panic attacks although i cannot confirm as i have not gone to the doctors or anything. Usually when these ""panic attacks happen, my bro and dad would stop arguing and would try and console me but nothing would help unless i am on my own for say 15-20mins. And within the 20mins or so they would start arguing about who caused this to me and back to square 1, i go into another ""panic attack"". But even when i try to tell them that, them arguing is what causes me to become into this ""monster"" they tell me that arguments are bound to happen and that i should not get panic attacks as in the ""real world"", it would be worse and that i would not be able to survive if i get panic attacks over ""small matters"" like these. Because of these arguements etc, i tend to stay away from my family as much as possible and try to stay with my friends as long as i can but even at 21 i still have a curfew that i need to follow and even if my dad doesnt care if i come home before 12mn or whatever the curfew is, my brother gets really pissed at me. To him, because my dad was really strict with him, and now my dad isnt as strict as he was with him, he should be the one who should be strict with my 23 y/o brother and me. I try to explain to him that pretty much everyone i know dont have a curfew when they are 21 and he tells me that their parents doesnt care about their kids but i care about u, so you should listen to me. I dont know whats wrong w me, my brother, or my family. Do i need to see a professional for my ""panic attacks""?",25Jan2020,1

We’ll start when I was in high school I got expelled for giving my friend weed (he told them I sold it to him and I was labeled as a dealer) so I didn’t graduate high school long story short. No degree. I’ve been smoking weed daily for about 5 years, my longest streak sober is 5 days. I’m currently working and splitting rent with my moms. That’s about $2400 per month for a 2 bed 2 bath in Southern California. About 9 months ago I got caught up in a mlm where I waisted a lot of money and in the last month I’ve broken free from that and I really don’t know where to go from here. About 4 months ago I got caught up in a one sided relationship where I just adored the girl and waisted my money and time on someone who just couldn’t see me in the same light. I’ve learned sometimes you just aren’t for that person and I’m working on coming to terms with that.Half of my money I spent on weed for the girl and myself, we rolled a lot of blunts and drive around together. We had a lot of fun together and we’re still friends. The other of my money was spent on the mlm. In total I’ve spent $40,000 that I’ve received from the father who passed a year ago from tongue cancer (which runs in my family and I fear I might have) I have $0 left from my half of his savings and I am absolutely ridiculously ashamed of waisting. I’m venting to this sub that I just found in the hopes of receiving support cause I’m in deep pain from my mistakes and I’m so ashamed.

I’ve kind of taken steps backward though at the start of this year and had my first anxiety attack since 2018. To give some context without going into a long story, I entered into a relationship at the end of last year but aspects of the relationship have been triggering my anxiety. I’ve been confiding in my best friend about this and she knows about my mental health battles. We don’t live in the same city and at first she was concerned and called me to talk. I ended up starting seeing a psychologist and she asked me how my first session went. But I noticed that her replies have gotten fewer and shorter, and I feel like she’s drawing away. It’s hard because I don’t want to dump on her but at the same time we are friends and I’ve been there for her too in some of her darkest times and I wish I could say more but I’m afraid of her getting tired of listening to me and not wanting to be close anymore. I just feel pretty alone and afraid to talk to even my other close friends about how I’m doing right now because of this issue. That they’ll just pull away not bc they dislike me necessarily but bc it’s burdensome or they don’t know what to say back so they just would rather put distance.

About 2 or 3 years ago I worked on myself a lot and discovered that I had been doing better. In that same time frame I also got into a relationship and for a bit was rather happy. However things turned bad and the relationship ended up being an abusive one where I got manipulated for about 2 years and it lead to my mental state becoming worse then ever. 

Now that i’m out of it i’ve discovered that my mental state just keeps deteriorating. My trust issues with people have gotten worse and i’ve realized I have cut a lot of people out of my life out of the fear of of them just using me for whatever purpose. Because of this i’ve become incredibly lonely but can’t bring myself to do anything about it. 

I’ve also realized many things about myself such that I can’t seem to pinpoint a personality for myself as I only ever mimic what others do.

And I haven’t fallen asleep early since 2018. Then suddenly February 1st 2019 came and I just stopped. Because I felt almost free and numb at the same time. At that time I went through a breakup in a toxic relationship. Where my stupid ass tolerated so much stuff and I thought it was normal and I was so blinded by love because of it. I thought by just letting all the feelings inside because I didn’t want to feel weak because of it. And I don’t know I just felt numb and I thought all feelings were gone and done. I physically stopped myself from overthinking. And I thought that was a good thing. But now November 2019 my friends noticed I was acting off. I didn’t realize it but I did at the same time. My friends said I was just acting more aggressive and stuff. And I thought I wasn’t but I know I was acting more aggressive with my dad but I thought I was normal to my friends. So to sum it all up.

For a long time I have had anger issues. I never get physical, but I yell and scream alot at my Fiancee, and Im ashamed to admit my daughter as well. I honestly didnt see how bad it was, but im starting too. She sat me down and told me that im not happy, and that she isnt happy. She is right, I just dont want to admit it. I was happy when I was with her, but only when I was with her. Nearly everything else would upset me. 

I lost my job about 6 months ago when my company went under. I went from being able to provide for 6 people to not having any money. This coincided with a bunch of drama from my meth addicted parent. I wont go into it. I was a wreck. Drank too much, and some day I couldnt even get out of bed. She got a job and started providing. Started to help me quit drinking and start working on myself. But it wasnt enough.

She told me I needed to leave to focus on myself. That I bring down the entire family with my anger, and I know she is right. She said she wont force me to leave, but she may as well have. She didnt want to be with me any longer while I was this way, and she didnt want me to be at home to try to improve myself. She didnt want to do this. I know she didnt. She was in tears, we have been together for nearly 10 years. When she was driving me to my brothers, she said she thinks she made a mistake. I didnt say anything. I was so hurt. I asked her to make a promise, that she wouldnt be with anyone else while I try to improve myself. She wouldnt, and I understand why. It just hurt so much to hear the love of my life say that. She is truly, the only thing I really care about. Not anything else. And it seems like that is the problem. She said she doesnt want us to end, she asked if she could keep the engagement ring I gave her. I said yes. We promised each other that whatever happens between here and then, we wont give up on eachother. I need to believe her.

I had what felt like a month long depressive episode this time; no energy, not talking much, no motivation; eating disorder kicked in. Three days ago, it’s like I suddenly shifted. I need less sleep and feel rested. I did some heavy work outs and I felt great - so great I was still able to go for a jog, visit family, and clean the entire house. I also talk A LOT MORE, and I’m able to eat more without guilt. My thoughts feel all over the place, but this is when I’m best at my job/life/relationship. And there’s a sense of euphoria. Honestly, I love having these states. I have these manic-like episodes less than once a month, though. Not sure how often the mania has to be for it to be bipolar. 

I’m already in therapy for “depression,” but what worries me is that there’s more to it. I’m not on any kind of meds, btw. 

Any insight is much appreciated.",25Jan2020,1
57,"I'm incapable of verbally expressing my emotions, and I suck at having conversations.

When I speak, I ramble and go off on tangents. It's my ADHD. I simply say what's on my mind: a jumbled mess of whatever the hell pops into my head along with blank space. It's embarrassing.

This has caused me to become completely socially isolated, at least in person. I've been in college for two years, and I haven't bothered going to a single event or talking to anyone outside of class.

A lot of times, when I leave a social situation, I beat myself up for every little thing I say. I can't stop it, the thoughts are compulsive. I've locked myself in my apartment for days on end on multiple occasions because I couldn't bring myself to leave. I was too embarrassed and disgusted by myself to go out in public. 

Hell, I even actively avoid my roommates. I have 3 of them, and they barely know me halfway through the year. Last year, I shared a 1 room dorm with my roommate, as well as a bathroom with two other people, and I hardly said a word to any of them.

When I’m around other people I’ve even started saying it, muffled pursing my lips. I don’t know if anyone has really understood what I am saying, although these outbursts seem to have only begun to progress in intensity, as well as my diminishing ability to restrain them.

No thoughts of self harm have accompanied these outbursts, but I’m concerned that might manifest itself later. Whenever I murmer those words to myself I am overcome with confusion and frustration.

Curious if anyone has experienced this, and any next steps I should take aside from expressing my concerns anonymously.

I got it together for a while, got a job, antidepressants and anxiety meds and everything was good.

&amp;#x200B;

If you read my profile, you'll see my situation.

Basically, I made a horrible, massive mistake as a child.  I hit my childhood dog, I just can't live with myself anymore.  I don't know what to do, I am terrified of myself.  

I am not mean spirited, I am not violent or dark.  (Listen, I know you'll judge me, I judge me too.  Please trust that, that isn't who I am) I want to understand why I thought it was okay, I want to understand why I didn't understand that it was a terrible thing to do.  I think so poorly of people who abuse animals, which is making it really difficult to forgive myself.  

If you don't want to read my long novel on my page, explaining in detail what happened - here's a summary.  For a few weeks period (Memory is unbelievably blurry, it could have been five days it could have been a month.  I don't remember how long this happened) I was the first to get home during the day and my baby girl, my baby dog was making massive messes of diarrhea and pee.  We had to crate her because our carpet was getting obliterated and we couldn't lose our security deposit.  I was 11ish, I don't remember exactly.  My older sister was always late to get me from school so that delayed me getting home by hours.  She was doing random drugs, which I found out years later.  My mom would be at work, and I would get home and basically just let out anger.  I am trans, this was well before I came out.  I didn't even know what transgenderism was, I knew I wanted to be a boy but didn't think I would ever be.  Anyway, I think I was so disassociated and angry, and basically I pretended all day to be a class clown.  I let out all this pent up anger on my dog for just doing her nature.  Everybody shits and pisses. 

I would literally give my life, I'd give every penny, I'd give my heart and soul, to be able to clean up her diarrhea again.  I would kill myself, seriously, I would have already - but my mom really loves me.  I don't know why.

My father beat me as a child and I know that may have something to do with it, but I didn't like being hit.  I knew it was wrong, why would I repeat it?  What the fuck man.  I just hate myself",25Jan2020,1

65,"I’m a 28 year old woman, and I’ve been struggling with my mental health since I was 10. For a long time, I just told myself I was a naturally sad person or just a mega introvert, but I know it’s more than that.

I’m not looking for a diagnosis, so I won’t go into too much detail, but my issues have included long periods of depression, trouble focusing in college, procrastination on basic tasks because the idea of them stress me out, crippling anxiety, and issues with romantic relationships that stem from fear of abandonment and issues with rejection. 

Anyways, after struggling with alcoholism for a long time, I’ve recently gotten sober, and now I’m ready to take the next step with my mental health. After being against any type of therapy or medication, I think maybe I’m ready to open that door, but have no idea where to begin, and what type of doctor I should see.

I hate my body, but I'm not motivated to work on it, I failed every attempt and anyway what's the point. When I look into my future is overwhelming. I know it's going to be though, painful and difficult. 
It all makes me so stressed, scared all I want to do is to stop. Escape, hide, shut down. I'm such a mess. Not cut for this life as it seems.

I try to get better. I got meds. I thought the anxiety ones do work and they kind of do but not enough. All of this sh*t is peaking through wanting to take control over me compeletely again. The antidepressant will probably take a while before it will start working if it actually will. I'd love to start therapy, but it's not possible. At least for now.

It's even harder when nobody knows what you go through. And you need to put your smiley face and function like a normal person would. But I fear that somebody would know. I don't want them to know. It's so f*cking complicated.

68,"I'm in an interesting spot right now. When I was 19, I was diagnosed with severe clinical depression and general anxiety disorder. I took antidepressants for a while. Tried to OD at one point. Had never had a job, was living at home, a virgin, never had a girlfriend, addicted to video games.

Fast forward to age 25: Working steady job, bought a new car a few months ago, looking to buy a house, have been off antidepressants for several years, accomplished/elite power lifter, gained a bunch of muscle, body count is nearing 50, have been in 3 longish term relationships, have 0 problem meeting women and have several fwb. I grew a nice beard too.

Yet, I don't feel like anything has improved. I'm laying in bed listening to depressing pop punk from the early 2000s trying to figure out why I'm randomly sad and in a weird funk and mood right now.

I’m currently on Pristiq and Abilify but they don’t work. 

Some things I’ve tried: 

1. Dozens of prescribed meds: Zoloft, Prozac, Xanax (got addicted), Cymbalta, Buspar, hydroxyzine, bupropion, Trintellix, Wellbutrin, etc.

2. Therapy: talk, exposure, acceptance, etc.

3. Supplements: NAC, l-theanine, caffeine, vitamin B, vitamin D

4. Illegal drugs: mescaline, LSD, LSA

5. Legal drugs: Siberian motherwort, dagga, CBD (not in a legal marijuana state), kava kava (tried today, helped but worried about liver + interactions with other meds)

70,"Alright this might sound stupid but here me out. 

I'm a very logical person. The best way to describe my way of thinking is stereotypical INTP. I know a lot of people don't like the Myers Briggs because there's the Holland Code and True colors that are ""technically"" more accurate but to be honest neither of them delve into anything enough for me, or at least such things haven't been explored yet. Anyways this'll make sense in a second I promise. 

The way I think I have my own systems and patterns, I love finding connections and putting all the details together to form the bigger picture. I've been diagnosed with 3 depressive disorders. As of late the only one I've been able to recognize with clear patterns is PMDD. Major depression and dysthmia are playing fucking tricks on me. Instead of following a pattern my mood has been as flighty as a bird. Going up and down and changing and like I understand to a degree that's normal? Especially lately I've actually been starting to feel better. But say two hours later I'll get worse. And then I can't gage my mood on my ""mood scale"" and that pisses me off. Especially when I'm not sure what I'm feeling or how I feel. I like having that tangible data to fall back on and present to my therapist and my psychiatrist. I also have outlier symptoms. I have hallucinations at night and I derealize sometimes. But like wtf why??? You're probably thinking ""Just spend sometime out of your own head"" and I'm trying not to over thinking but I have that drive to just FIGURE IT OUT. And I can't. And it's driving me mad. The DSM gave specific criteria for this shit and if I don't fall under that then wtf is the point. Wtf am I.

72,"I’m just going to start this off by saying I know this is severely screwed up so don’t come at me for disclosing all of this information please. I am trying to sort everything out. Also, this may be very long.

Back in middle school around 7th grade, I kind of went into an emo phase I guess you would say and started hanging out with that group of people and all that because I thought it was cool or edgy. That eventually led to me wanting to be similar to them which somehow ended up to a slight depressive period and I ended up self-harming for attention. I put an emphasis on the “for attention” part because it was strictly for that reason. People say when you self-harm, your body releases endorphins but for me, I didn’t notice a difference at all. It was more due to the fact that a buddy of mine was doing it so I decided to do it to. Mostly, it was more of a “I have that too” or “I have more than you” kind of thing.

Anyways, I ended up getting institutionalized voluntarily for an observation period by my father because he was a drunken arsehole who liked to start fights and called the cops on me. 
I was diagnosed with Major Depression during that time period and honestly, it went away shortly after that when I got out of that toxic environment and got out of that peer group. But here is where things get a little screwed up. I did outpatient services after I was released and I never told them that I was no longer dealing with it. I liked the attention I got from that. I for one reason or another, decided to continue on and list off symptoms to the psychiatrist that I was “having” and faked having a form of Psychosis which eventually led to a diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type. I sat there and told every Psychiatrist, therapist, and Nurse practitioner what symptoms I had and what they wanted to hear to purposely twist everything to make it sound like I was suffering from Schizoaffective Disorder even though I wasn’t. Eventually, I grew the hell up and got over the bs and just told my family that I no longer had symptoms and everyone was just like okay cool. My mother was surprised because usually a disorder like that doesn’t just “go away”. I still haven’t told my family the truth of what actually happened and I’m wanting to do that. They think that it can come back or I can relapse or something but they don’t know that it never happened to begin with. This lie has been carried on for the past almost decade and they still don’t know the truth.

How do I go about relaying this type of thing to my family without them thinking I’m a Psychopath? This isn’t something you can just bring up and have a laugh about it saying like “haha got you”. I’m trying to clean up the damn mess that I made and it’s starting to seem like I made a HUGE mess and dug myself a deep hole.

Re-analyzing this situation makes me realize that this entire thing sounds like a huge scenario involving a severe case of Munchausen Syndrome (Not self-diagnosing, just pointing it out) and it is sad.

The last 2 spent living in an add on with his mother who has dementia. She's gone into a home now and my partner has really lost his mind. He has no impulse control and shames me in public with his tom foolerly and inappropriate behaviour. I tried to keep him together but he won't follow any advice, has terrible memory and won't stop drinking. We are moving into a house he's been renting in a week or so and I'm trying to hang in there but it's really hard. He asks me what's wrong when I dissociate from him and I can't talk.

Today for example we go to see his mother in memory care and I drive, seeing as he's  so drunk he has to shut alternating eyes to see. As soon as we see his mother he leaves the room and doesn't come back for half an hour, he was talking to a woman with dementia about the pros and cons of having a single instead of shared room. I spent that time answering the same questions over and over, trying to distract her, pretending her dead relatives are doing fine etc. When we arrived there were no parks and he told me to get out and parked his car in an obviously no parking zone, on a gravel verge,  so that people stared and looked at each other. I told him no I'm going to wait for a park, some people are leaving now so you go in. He berates me for doing the right thing. We get home and he acts like a child, he rarely acts like an adult now.

I never thought about it but ever since I was 5, I always felt not real and not all there. I don’t know if it was from medication or trauma, but I either felt people weren’t real or I was living in a world where no one was like me and had actual thoughts; like human beings, not animals.

And this brings me to dissociation and social anxiety, from being so self aware I would really push myself about being awkward and thinking about other people’s thoughts of me, and this went on for 20 years. I would get compliments but still think I’m being judged or ridiculed.

Social anxiety so severe I couldn’t go outside, I dropped out of school, and it took me until a few years ago to move on from it. I wouldn’t talk to anyone in person and sit quietly, in fear of being judged, even with family members.

The only way this can be truly fixed is to re-wire my brain and think positive and not negative. I can make my self feel and negative and a horrible mood instantly and pretty much feel this 24-7 all the time.

I'm trying so hard to think positive but my brain litterly can't function that way. Medicine will only mask the problem I just need to figure out how to help myself feel happy.

She said I was treatment resistant to depression and the only way is to do therapy to change my out-look on life but I've seen the therapist and years and can't change my wiring of my brain, it's like my brain has to automatically find problems and come up with multiple solutions

82,"Hello,

I struggled with depression and social anxiety in my teen years. Although I am well now, there is something that has been on my mind. My thought process is slower than what it used to be before I struggled.

Before, I was the kind of person who could do calculations in her head in seconds. Words came naturally to me, I did pretty fine in maths, and I had a teacher who even suggested that I did this test to skip a few grades, as I was basically learning nothing new in school (my parents refused though, because I already struggled making friends, being in a group of older people would only make it harder).

Of course, when I had my mental health problems, my grades dropped. When I started getting therapy, they went up again, but I still didn't feel like my old self. I actually needed to study to memorize things, speaking and writing didn't flow as well as it used to and while I was good at maths (I did understand the concepts), I was relying on my calculator and memorisation to make fairly simple calculations and sketch graphs.

I do feel like I'm improving slowly over time, though. Being in university as a Physics undergrad, which is very much a maths-oriented course, helps, and I'm also actively practicing a new language, English, as I'm originally from southern Europe and decided to study in England (so sorry for any mistakes, still learning!). But I still need to study and actually try to understand some stuff that might have come as obvious, had I kept the same skills I had when I was younger.

I was wondering if anyone else went through something similar. 
I did not take any medication, just therapy with a professional, so it's not any sort of side effect. Does mental illness make you ""dumber""?

Anyway, I wish you a great day. Sending positive vibes to y'all",25Jan2020,1
83,"I really hate myself. So last night was games night at my local games workshop were I play kill team. I meet up with a guy called Adam every 2 weeks and play a couple of games. He gives me a lift into town but says he needs to get something from a shop first, so I went ahead to GW planning on getting everything set up ready for us to play. I walk into the shop and it's the most busy I've ever seen it. I'm instantly anxious. There's no room for us to play. So I asked the manager if I could move the models from one of the display boards, he says no he can't but then he gives in thankfully. I'm all hot and bothered now so I take my beanie hat off and at that point Adam and 3 other guys walk in! I'm all anxious sorting my hat hair out and people are all around me and the shops not big at all. There must have been about 15 people. Anyway we play 2 games, at times I didn't know what Adam is on about and got confused with what is happening in the game because there was so much being said around me. I won both games BTW, not that it matters to me because I'm not a competitive player. So now I'm waiting for Adam to give me a lift back home, he doesn't seem in a rush, so I go outside for a cig. This is where it just totally fucked up. I needed a drink and didn't have one, or money to buy one. While smoking I'm looking at all the display models in the window. There's a Great Unclean One that wasn't there before and since I've recently bought this model I finished my cig and walked back inside wanting to talk about it. I asked a question but my voice sounded muted and not at all what it normally sounds like. Awkward, cringey and just fucking spesh!

He's down for it which is great obviously, but there's no excitement or motivation for me to do it, just cringe.

86,"Recently I went on a high risk venture over a week period. It ended with me waking up on a hospital bed in shock after a detox from a mixture of alcohol and xanax. I sat in my hospital bed in disbelief at the spotty memories of the night before. In my blackout state I decided to get in my sisters car because I needed to get home before sunrise. I swerved into a guardrail going about 35 mph and I very clearly remember realizing what I had done and crawled my way to the middle of the road hoping and expecting to never wake up again as I drifted away. I realized that the flashing lights and faint memories of faces filled with both disgust and anger weren't a dream. This was very out of the ordinary in the eyes of my loved ones, but it made me think of other experiences I initiated in high risk behavior to manipulate my emotions. One visit to Mexico illegally to visit a girl I had met in person once before, countless nights of drinking to black out in an attempt to feel something other than misery, maxing my credit cards attempting to buy my happiness and other nights of feeling invincible and angry just looking for a fight to feel a rush of adrenaline in lieu of suicidal thoughts. Tonight for the first time in my life I feel empathy for my late father rather than anger. His actions aren't completely justified by his diagnosis of bipolar disorder but I can now understand his constant struggle of emotions and addiction. 

I don't know what my diagnosis will be if any but I had a breakthrough tonight. I laid out a very long, detailed and scatter brained message to my wife explaining my lifelong battle with these extreme emotional ups and downs and how they've affected me. For the first time in my life I broke down and pleaded for help with my emotions. I feel a huge mix of emotions right now. I feel relief to finally have the support of others with my struggle of emotions. I feel nervous for what treatment or therapy might bring me. I feel scared that I may never feel the way I imagine ""normal"" feels. But most of all I feel STRONG because I have rid myself of the stigma that having mental health issues makes you weak. After 27 years on this emotional roller coaster I can finally admit that I can't do this alone.",25Jan2020,1

89,"I carry a lot of trauma from childhood abuse.

I now work with children experiencing traumatic home situations, and I’m doing a degree in psychology with a heavy focus on childhood trauma. 

It’s like my brain is wired to the trauma and I don’t know how to be a functional person outside of it. I am very effective and dedicated to my work and sometimes I think it’s helpful and healing for me to be able to be the person that can understand and help children like I wasn’t helped, but other times I think it’s damaging because I’m reliving my trauma constantly. It also serves as a reminder that while I’m here, living and breathing my work to ensure my children are supported, I am confronted with the reality that when I was a child, nobody picked me up and cared for me, and that if they had maybe things wouldn’t be as bad as they are. When I’m not at work, or focusing on work, or talking about work, I feel empty and devoid and distressed.

Just wanted to get that off my chest. It’s a realisation that came to me recently, after years of insisting that I just find psychology really interesting and enjoy working with children.",25Jan2020,1

I know it’s structured in a way for optimum collection of data but does anyone else ever feel like they need options that lie between the choices?

The result of the visit was severe depression and a change in medication so, fingers are crossed that I start to feel like doing something other than laying on the couch all day/night. 

One thing I don’t understand, and maybe some of you can provide feedback, is this: knowing how past trauma shapes many behaviors and attitudes towards oneself, why isn’t this more of a part of the evaluation process? I mean, I understand that these evaluations are focused on symptoms but I just don’t understand why trauma doesn’t have more of a role.

Before my teen years, even in middle school I would always be the quietest in class and never really said much. I kept telling myself that it'll probably get better as I get older, but it never does. It gets worse. I know this might not seem like a major problem to some, but not having any sort of human connection  in years is really making my mental health deteriorate. Almost every time I try to go out and socialize I run into  a situation where I'm trying to talk to somebody and I cannot for the life of me think of what to say. The other person then gets the impression that I'm being rude or don't like them, when that's not the case at all. I just don't like myself really. I feel like everything I say is boring or uninteresting so I just don't say anything at all. My biggest issue though is I don't know how to be present.

98,"Hello! I was wondering if anyone could recommend types of therapy that have been helpful for them or just give general advice for finding the right therapy. 

A little info: I’m 23F, from NZ, currently in the middle of getting diagnosed for bipolar type 2. I’ve had anxiety since I can remember. Periods of depression and suicidal thoughts since high school. Traumatic childhood. I have an appointment for psychiatric evaluation in early February to work out a proper diagnosis and a plan, I’m guessing we will talk about therapy at this appointment and I’d like to know what options are out there. 

I’ve had some CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) but I didn’t find it very helpful; the therapist spent the first session talking about my childhood and anxiety etc which was good but the rest of the sessions were focused on teaching me tools to help with anxiety. I’m quite self aware and I’ve already been using these tools for years, the problem is that I’m getting worse despite them so I obviously need something further than that. I’m taking some medication but that also needs to be changed and I feel like it’s only treating the symptoms. 

I found talking about my childhood other problems quite relieving, it’s like I need that stereotypical therapy you see in movies where they lay on a couch and talk about feelings haha!

I'm 27, have a really good job that I've worked at for five years with a great boss. In the last semester of my masters and graduate in May. I got married last year and she's the best wife a guy could ask for. Decent but smaller friend group since college, engaging church on weekends and I'm in decent shape and enjoy outdoors stuff. My question is this, I feel like nothing ever really gets me super excited or that I never feel fulfilled as I picture it in my head. I'm not a sad person or a downer and I'm super happy with how my life is.... and yet I feel like I've never found my purpose... I'd like to become a manager in higher education or private sector IT and use my skills and knowledge I've acquired. I want to buy a house and have kids in the next five years. My wife and I have plans on trips to take. Yet I feel like I'm sleepwalking through life because nothing is as fulfilling or exciting as I think it should be. I'll occasionally buy stuff I don't need and then wonder why I did it (not too often). I'm a go-getter and want to be really good at everything I do and to everyone I know. One example is I'll buy books that look interesting and I love the topics, but I never feel like sitting down to enjoy them. A lot of this I realize sounds like depression and maybe to some extent it is, but it's more to me like I don't know what brought me here or what to do with my time... I have hobbies like reading, walking, podcasts on sports, business, leadership, and video games, I love to fish, etc... My wife and I also have a ton of the same interests so that's always been good too. I'd bet 9/10 people would say you've got everything going for you.

113," 

I see a therapist from time to time, and i told her that my chief life goal amongst others was to be at the same level as others.

she asked what i meant by that, and i said i felt there was a plot in life to undermine me. i notice people give me shit for stuff the masses do - just out of spite and because i don't meet their definition of normal. occasionally this makes me feel a bit terse and i am rude to people. i sometimes enjoy it since I'm a human and under no obligation to be nice/welcoming. no person is.

for instance, I am not a loud and outgoing person. I'm not shy at all but then i usually don't jabber a lot or be hyper/lively. but then I was in a class a few weeks ago, and some student asked me ""why aren't you very loud?"" I responded ""it's who I am, get over it!"" and then she complained to some of the other students that i was ""rude"". but there was this girl there who seldom said anything. I contributed a LOT to class discussions and she never did. and I doubt this fellow student who ""got offended"" said that to her. i'm not bragging here but the lecturer at the end of the course said ""D, you're a smartass and do you, since you'll be an asset to any employer."" so clearly, unless she was lying, I had a good contribution. but nooooo.... pick on D coz he's easy!

My therapist said how long i've had these feelings and i said for years. she said I don't seem to have any paranoia but then to identify why i think/feel this way. if anything happened that made me this way. I just said that I don't know, and i just am on a quest to be at the same level as everybody else.

She then asked me if i had self-esteem issues and i said no. She said that maybe being rude can backfire, but then i said i was standing my ground a lot and defending my corner. She said it's normal to be defensive but then there are ways to go about it. I get her point and she is right largely. But then I don't see why people should stop me on my quest to be at the same level as others.

I told her of another instance where I was in line at the supermarket, and some random store clerk just hit her trolley into me when there was enough space to move around me. I was just at the sandwich counter and it was clear she had some agenda against me. I didn't do anything, and i said to her quite loudly ""watch it!!"" she ignored me and i just shoved her. not hard, but for me it was tit for tat. The clerk looked at me harshly and even with trepidation, and for what? don't barge your trolley into me. and no, it was no accident. there was plenty of space to maneouvre and no reason to hit me.

the therapist said i understand i felt bad or embarrassed but then maybe she didn't mean it. Well, look that's not normal. i've worked in customer service roles before and it has never been a norm where i have worked. I guarantee that if it were somebody who she deemed more ""normal"" she would not have done this. I don't tolerate anybody who tries their best to undermine me for petty reasons.

In the next session, I asked the therapist how i was feeling about the last time, and I said that i was still a bit angry but had gotten over it mostly. i just said that it was some other dude, it wouldn't be so. She said she didn't think there was anything wrong with me, as she did a screening for various conditions but i didn't fit. i didn't and don't fit the profile for autism or any DSM condition.

She said that it may not be people out to mess with me but then I disagreed.  
she probably thinks I'm a bit nutty, but i don't care. what will she do, section me? or lock me away?

there was an incident where she agreed with me and at least my feelings. I had to make an appointment for an exam and to get there early i had to exit a station. The train stopped but there were some teenage girls who were in the door space and i initially asked politely as the doors were opening to get off. the train only would stop for 15 seconds or so, and i asked again and they didn't move. so then I shouted that ""you're in the way! move out the f-ing way!!"" and they did. had i not got off at that point, I would have missed my exam and had to pay for another ticket as it was literally 35 miles to the next station. I know for a fact that if a guy had the appearance of Idris Elba or Travis Fimmel they would ease him through and not impede a random stranger.

tl;dr

It's one of my chief life goals to get what everybody else was handed. my therapist doesn't think i'm paranoid, but then seems to think that i need to examine why i have feelings of injustice and persecution.",25Jan2020,1
114,My life has been crumbling. Recently my boyfriend broke up with me and he was honestly the only thing holding me onto reality. My friends all know that I’ve been planning to kill myself for a long time but it’s definitely becoming a reality. I only felt happiness around him. I never looked at other boys nor did I plan on ever losing him. What people have told me is that I’m too clingy but being honest it’s only because he doesn’t understand my emotions. I always feel like I’m doing too little and maybe that’s why I’d go overboard a lot of the time. I knew he had a problem with me being clingy so I started to distance myself. But I guess it wasn’t enough. I honestly tried so hard and I feel like a sack of shit. Last night I wrote suicide notes to my friends and family and stapled them to my bulletin board. I left and went to the river near my house and sat at the bridge trying to decide if I should or not. I ended up coming home after getting talked down by a friend.

117,"My anxiety has been untreated nearly my whole life. Recently, my sister whose also a psychiatrist linked certain forms of ADD to anxiety, at least in our family and the family she married into and had kids with. Her, her husband and one of her three kids especially prone to anxiety have gone on slow-release ADD medication and have praised it deeply, however she credits most of her recovery from crippling anxiety to learning about, becoming certified in/practicing, and having EMDR therapy done for herself. She recommends it VIGOROUSLY. 

About me: I have had crippling but somehow also high-functioning anxiety as long as I can remember. Experienced plenty of trauma, from parents divorcing, mother diagnosed with and fighting cancer twice, passing away from complications from cancer a week after my high school graduation, harsh breakups, being cheated on repeatedly, an abusive marriage in which I watched my stepson be emotionally and mentally abused repeatedly, took custody of him when she went and had an affair and fucked off for a year and she saw him and our son together maybe 4 or 5 times for a few hours apiece, then had custody of the stepson legally taken away by her... I could go on and on. 

Now I'm navigating an amazingly strong and healthy relationship, but I'm working far - commuting 4hrs a day because the money is good and the experience is what I need and the sellers of the house I bought scammed me and I'm trying to get the home I own fixed and paying $15k to get it done. 

I'm not taking care of myself either. I used to do BJJ 5-6 times a week, or was at the gym 5-7 days a week, eating right and losing weight and not drinking, meditating and pretty dang happy. 

TL;DR - life is fucking hard and I'm having trouble coping. Looking into EMDR, has anyone tried it or had experience with it? ADD meds helped anyone's anxiety?",25Jan2020,1

121,"Alright, I wanna try to stick to facts as much as possible. So my problem is, I'm a 24 y/o male, looking 17, I am very skinny, I probably weigh around 115 lbs at 5'7"". So in general, this makes it hard enough to get through life. I always had issues to find a girlfriend, but when I finally found my current partner, I kinda figured out that she was the type of woman that wants to wear the pants. No matter what it is, everything always has to be done her way, she even tries to point things out by facts and logic, she's always trying to call the shots, and can't accept it if she can't get things done her way. Now back to facts and logic, I think that because I'm unattractive to most of the women out there, those who want the man to be calling the shots, be in charge and everything, I automatically attract those kinds of women who wanna be in charge, taking the lead etc. Also I do not wanna be sizeist, but she almost weighs twice as much as I do, and to be honest, I like it. Still I don't like that gender role reversal, I do not want to be dominated by a woman, and just because there are relationships were the woman is bigger than her boyfriend, it doesn't mean that she has to be the one who's in charge and taking the lead. I also gotta mention that she's not physically stronger, but sometimes I start brooding, questioning if my brain actually works with it's left side, or if I'm a right-brained person, like any feminine individual should be. The upsetting thing isn't thinking about it, but comparing it, e.g if my girlfriend and I play video games together, and this game I am taking as an example is mostly about logic, analysis and pathing, so whenever she performs better than me, isn't it her using the left side of her brain more than I do?  I've read facts that men tend to use their left brain a lot more often than women, while women tend to use their right brain and intuition. So if I am right, and by that I don't mean right-brained, doesn't it mean that my brain works more the ""feminine way"" while her brain works more the masculine way? If so, I am trying to figure out how to change that, all of it, I wanna be the man wherever I go, and besides gaining weight, I'll do everything to change it, I don't care if I become an apathetic person, what matters to me is analysis and facts, even if I have to give up intuition and empathy for it, it's unwanted in a masculine individual if you're not into gender role reversal. I don't have facts that prove my emotions are blocking the analytical part of me, but it seems that logic and intuition are opposites, which creates the possibility that logic blocks intuition (people being reasonable leave any kind of emotion behind, and vice versa). So does anyone have any advice for me, how I could possibly start changing my mind to be less emotional and more reasonable?",25Jan2020,1

123,"I have official diagnosis of OCD, depression, Asperger's both social and generalised anxiety, and a possible binge eating disorder (I did get ""assessed"" for an eating disorder, but instead I got told to get motivated and see a dietitian. I honestly don't think the woman who ""assessed"" me, liked me because morbidly obese people can't get eating disorders).

So for a while now I've been thinking whether I have some form of psychosis because some of the things that I always considered OCD don't seem to fit the OCD category. Here's why: 

* I genuinely believe that no one's life matters only Japanese people's. It's like my life and other people's lives don't matter. It's like I think Japanese people are these perfect beings that have no flaws. (I currently think this one)
* I used to believe that cartoon characters hated me, but mainly my mum, like they felt real feelings like a human would towards us. (I don't really experience this one anymore, but without medication, I would)
* I can taste things in my nose at random times, like I've had tastes of smoke, mayo, desserts.  (I currently experience this one)
* I genuinely think that I'm going to win the lottery or a load of money, so I keep buying tickets and gambling. Even when I've gotten through £100, I keep going thinking I'm going to win.  (I currently think this one)

Without medication or when a slight tweak in medication, I am seriously deluded. It goes to the point where I somewhat can't tell what's real and what's not. I don't really hear voices or see things that aren't there, I just believe these beliefs that others would find strange.

Then comes another crazy part - it's like I want to have psychosis because to me, it will make me feel special. I know I shouldn't think like this, but I can't help it. I also want to go into a mental hospital because then someone might listen to my concerns. I also feel like I need to kill myself because the my friend died of cancer and someone else I knew killed themselves because of mental illness. I feel like I need to die now. I also want to experience if heaven is real.

It’s like I want to go into the kitchen but something is stopping me.

I also keep feeling overwhelmed. I don’t feel comfortable anywhere but in my bedroom and its getting hard to leave. When I leave my room everything just comes at me so fast. The light from the window, the dirty dishes, the shoes on the floor, my laundry. When I see things like this I get a sharp pain in my stomach and short anxiety attacks.

I have also had a few panic attacks relating to my mother and some other things. I have noticed also that I over think a lot and I have strong fears of abandonment and cheating in my relationship. I know that she wouldn't cheat on me but I can't shut down the thoughts and fears.  I also have troubles to start to do anything like my homework for example.

140,"So love is a really complicated and multi-faceted thing, so breaking it down into something that is so true it can apply to any form of love is actually a really hard thing. Luckily, even though my real parents never taught me love, it is something you can get a grasp on with lectures from really smart and compassionate people and a lot of thinking and writing.

Basically, the best definition of love that I have heard is, “the feeling that comes from the mutual understanding that life is suffering, but that it is worth it in spite of this.”

The thing that is called “love” the most, that is, what is actually little more than hormonal emotions bringing people together for reproduction, is not really love at all. It’s all instinct. Love can be involved in such relationships, but sexual relationships can exist without any love at all. In fact, I think many do.

But you don’t need to like, have a complete philosophical understanding of love to experience it, either. I think that most people who have experienced love really haven’t thought about it enough to explain it to another person. Love is a pretty universal thing. Like, you don’t have to understand nuclear fusion to feel the warmth of the sun.

I’m really glad that I was able to find a good explanation of it, because it is something that I haven’t really ever experienced before. And so, I had no understanding of how to use it. But now I understand that I have to at the least act like I am worthy of existing in spite of the suffering of life, and that this is the first step in finding love, not what you should be seeking to find in the end. Because if you put all your eggs in one basket, very little can save you from tragedy. 

My favorite part of this definition of love is that it really applies to every possible type of love. Romantic love, parental love, platonic love, the Buddhist love of all of nature, it’s just great.

I know it isn’t perfect. There are an infinite number of explanations for any given phenomena, and so there will always be a better definition somewhere. However, I have something I can work with here.

I hope some day I can find someone to share love with. I don’t know who they will be or what kind of a relationship wit will be. But I do have hope. That is more than I had before.",25Jan2020,1

150,"Hi all, 

I am female (18), my boyfriend is soon to be 19. We have been dating for about 4 months, long distance. During this time, we have been chatting every day, still learning new things about each other. I opened up to him about my past experience of sexual assault which caused me anxiety and depression, as well as me currently attending therapy for these things. He has been nothing but supportive for me. 

Recently, within the last 5 days, he opened up to me about his own current struggle with mental health. We were on Facetime and he told me how he feels lonely and lost, how his home with his family doesn't even feel like a home. As a way to cope, he's been doing drugs (MDMA, nangs, cocaine, etc.) to numb with his pain. And he's doing it often. Including on nights which he has work the next day and still goes to work even though he's still high and only had 3 hours sleep. He also told me during Facetime that he felt better telling me as he hadn't told anyone, but he was scared to tell me because he was worried I would call him a druggo and leave him. 

I know this isn't him and that he's going through a rough patch as he hardly touched drugs when we first met. Only the occasional joint and LSD trip here and there. Nothing as heavy as what he's doing now. He's only started doing heavy drugs often within the last 2/3 weeks. 

So back to my main question:

How do I help him? How do I support him? I want to be there for him but it's hard when he's a $500 4 hour plane trip away. I told him I'm always a call away and if he ever feels like he's going to harm himself, especially in a way which is irreversible, that I'm only a call away and it doesn't matter when he calls me during the day or night. I told him I'd rather lose sleep staying up all night talking to him than waking up the next day to the news that he's done something terrible. 

I'm just wondering if there's anything else I can do to help him? Obviously if he keeps doing drugs, (he told me during the Facetime he's going to stop), I won't be able to stay with him because it's too emotionally draining, especially when I have my own stuff to deal with. 

He told me he's told his best friend (2 days after our Facetime, after I encouraged him too because he needs a support person who lives in his city) and that his best friend took it well and will try to be there for him. I'm just wondering what else I can do because I feel like I'm not doing enough ??? I just really want to help him :((

153,"Huge long life story so prepare yourself. My dads an art teacher and teaches in our house. Ever since I was little I drew a lot and I guess I was ok at it and my parents saw that I had talent for it. As I got older (11-12) my dad started teaching me with his students. During this time he was very harsh and strict with me, and we would fight. He would see a fault in my drawing that I wouldn’t see and scold me for it and drill into my head that I made a mistake. I also had and still have anxiety, and being yelled at in front of my peers was horrible. I remember once he tore a drawing of mine in front of everyone. I grew to be jealous and spiteful of everyone around me because they would draw something that wasn’t the greatest and he would praise them over it, while I got nothing even if I drew something really well. This caused so much turmoil within me, and as years passed by nothing changed. My mom was the only one that cared how I felt, and would deliver my feelings to my dad, so I wouldn’t have to talk to him. He also hit me on occasion but he’s an immigrant parent so whose surprised lol. In middle school things got really bad I because suicidal and self harmed, not really out of sadness but more out of anger, and I wished that when i died my dad would regret treating me like. Also, since I was in middle school, my dad would talk about what school I should go to and why program I should go into, and obviously I believed that since what seven grade child knows exactly what program they wanted to go to. I’m now in grade 11, and realized all this time I don’t even know if I want to do that program. I remember in 9th grade I would stress over it, and go on the school website and read over the portfolio guidelines and obsessively watch YouTube videos on how to get into that school, as the acceptance rate was pretty low. Now that I realize I don’t know if I want to do that, I feel stressed. I’m not good at anything besides art, but my dad has been making me feel like shit and inadequate at that for years. My anxiety for art and him is so bad that even stepping into that room that he teaches in gives me anxiety and makes my stomach hurt. Recently he was trying to teach me to draw something, and obviously, I was doing something wrong and unaware of it. I was also kinda pleased in myself cause I thought I improved. My dad did not share the same thought. He came up and said that everything was wrong, and started talking about how obvious the mistake is. He does this thing where whenever I make a mistake he always repeats how obvious is it and how I’ve been drawing for so long and how I should know better and I should draw more and he repeats the same thing but with different wording.  I’ve been already feeling really shitty about my art and I started crying. He saw me start to cry and turned away and started fixing it, continuing to say that I should know better. I thought a bit, and decided I wanted to tell him how I felt. How ever since I was young, he made me feel bad about myself. How art is the one thing I have for me and now I can’t do it. How I have no future for myself. How he wanted to make me want to die in middle school. He first started laughing while I told him this, struggling to speak cause I was crying and gasping for breathe. When I told him it was him that made me want to die in middle school, he got super accusatory and angry. He started saying “Why is it my fault you’re bad at art?” “You should be trying harder, it not my fault.” I was sort of shocked at his response, but it didn’t phase me. I told him that I can never tell him what’s going on in my head, and he ignored me.  I asked him whether he and my mom were going to China when I graduate highschool, and he chuckled and said that my moms staying but he’s going. He then said “aren’t you happy I’m leaving and your moms staying. When I go no ones going to have to care for you.” When he said that I was on the verge of yelling. And I told him moms the only person that cares about me. He laughed and went back on his computer. He told me to get out and stop wasting his time. As I left, I told him that if I dont come downstairs, it means I killed myself. I said it laughing and jokingly, because i was actually considering it, and if I told him without joking I would get my ass beat. He laughed and said that he’s kick my body if I killed myself, and I went upstairs. My dad makes me want to die. I know I’m not depressed because the only times I’ve been sad or wanting to die is because of him. He gives me so much anxiety and I wished I was never born. I want to go to therapy but I think my dad would be mad. My mom would support me because she’s asked me before if I wanted to go to therapy. I’m also gay and haven’t came out and if I did I know my parents would hate me. I wish I could be shot and didn’t have to deal with life anymore.

I'm 22 years old and I want to bring awareness to mental health issues in Canada. 
Canada is improving its mental health but lots more needs to be done.

My story is that I was sexually assaulted at work. (I have filed a police report). 
I now have PTSD and am unable to work due to daily panic attacks and nightmares every night. 

The workers compensation insurance board will pay for my counselling but not for my time off work because I was able to work for a few months before I broke down and my PTSD took over. 

I have doctor notes and psychiatric notes explaining that PTSD is an illness that can take months or years to show symptoms.

I have to wait 8 months to see a professional mental health counsellor which is covered by the insurance board. 

My city offers walk in counselling but you can only go 3 times per year.

I'm maxed out on walk in counselling,  and I still have months before counselling thought the workers compensation Insurance board starts. 

I have no money coming in and I'm unable to work. 

My car was reposed because I couldn't make the payments. 

The whole thing has been a living nightmare.

I have a few ideas for how to improve the mental health system:

- Offer a psychiatric assessment after a traumatic event covered by the workers compensation insurance. 

-Offer more education regards to mental illness and how it affects people. 

-Free counselling. Not 3 times max per year.

Obvious throwaway.  
Not attention seeking but more seeking advice....

All I have been thinking about the past 2 weeks.  
I'm currently 16.  
I'm very introverted and shy with almost no social skills. I stay away from everyone. Getting bullied all the time.  
That's why from a young age I have thought about video games,the internet or PC's being an escape from that.  
However that lead to me being really overweight and again no social skills.  
On top of that I have realized I'm 16 and getting close to finishing school and thought to myself how will I ever get a wife or even girlfriend since I've never really been in a relationship or a life in general with actual friends ?  
On top of many medical problems effecting relationships.  
What if my parents pass away and i have no family of my own ?  
Sitting there depressed. Been thinking about this for weeks.  
I cant change it. I cant be normal and hanging out with people.  
Most people in this country like smoking,drugs,parties and ect ect.  
I cant do it. I dont wanna do this. I dont know anyone IRL so I have no incentive to go out.  
I mean what do I do ? Go out and walk around the street asking for friends ?  
Im hoping Uni might fix stuff. Maybe I find a girl or friends with common interests.

this bit can get triggering so i apologise in advance but I did warn before.

Please delete this if it’s inappropriate, mods.

The concept of Adverse Childhood Events has only come to my attention recently, and after doing some searching, I realized...wow, I might have had some.  A few.  Like, one every couple of years, right into adulthood.  It took me an hour to document them, and I haven’t even gotten to 20 and beyond (35F).

Thing is, none of them were brought on by abuse or neglect.  I never went without things I needed.  I had a good family, all told.  Just...bad luck, unfortunate things happening over and over that caused me fear and avoidance.  I *perceived* them as a trauma, sometimes for good reason.  But they don’t seem to fit any of the communities.  Hell, even the ACE test asks about nothing but abuse and neglect situations—don’t get me wrong, those are tragic and awful, but what about medical trauma, or someone who’s never had anything but shit luck from the get-go?

For instance, being in a car wreck at age ten.  Our van hit a patch of ice and spun out and slammed into a highway guard rail.  Nobody was seriously injured, but for a long time afterward I was terrified of riding somewhere when there was snow and ice on the roads.  I didn’t want to do it, but I didn’t get a choice, sat and just oscillated with terror in the backseat until I could finally escape.

I choked on candy, twice, had to go to the ER the second time.  I had a van bench seat dropped on my head.  Being separated from family for the first time to go to school made me cry every day for weeks.  I was in a car fire.  I *hated* getting stomach flu and freaked out every single time it happened.  I panicked when it happened to other family members, afraid I would catch it too.

And when I was thirteen my body suddenly decided I had emetophobia.  I started having panic attacks that still happen regularly to this day.  Just had one right now.  I know I’m not in any danger, but they’re still goddamn terrifying.  And there’s no escaping them.  They can strike any time.

And now I’m wondering how all this has affected me as an adult.  I have quit more jobs than I’ve kept because the pressure of working eventually threw me into a downward spiral of panic attacks.  Now I’m in a high-stress job (THAT was a mistake) I can’t quit because I have no money and no one to support me.  My boss is great and literally gives me half the workload other people do, and sometimes it’s still too much.  

My siblings, who experienced almost no adverse events, have gone on to successful careers and “normal” lives.  But me, it’s like my stress response is just broken.  Like the pathways were laid in my brain a long, long time ago, and now that’s just how it reacts, regardless of the actual severity of the situation.  All the panic, all the time.

I take meds and practice mindfulness, but it’s still frustrating and exhausting.  I wonder what it’s doing to my future health.  I’m in the process of looking for a suitable therapist, but I guess I just wanted some feedback that I’m not imagining this or making it up.  If I belong in another community, that’s fine too.  I just can’t seem to find much help for people who’ve been screwed over from the start, through the direct fault of absolutely no one.

183,"This will be a little long, but I need to explain. I am going to graduate school soon, so I had been going to lots of information sessions for the specific schools I liked.


One of these was a class visit session that had a small social gathering the evening prior. At this party, an older looking guy (30-40?) approached me and a group of students I was speaking with. I introduced myself and he introduced himself as 'Jerry'. Immediately it appeared as though he was high or drunk, just because of his slurred speech / stuttering and how droopy his eyes were. But when the waiter came by to offer us drinks he just asked for 'more tea', so he must not have been drunk.


I went home soon after, and remember thinking how inappropriate the behavior would have been (if it was that he was drunk/high), considering he was presumably also an applicant for this top school, and he may not want to be seen that way at an official event. I thought maybe the next morning during the class session he may be sober and that would have been that. Jerry arrived early and sat at the front seat.  He participated often and asked questions in a way that was too extra, and seemed inappropriate at times because his timing was off and interrupted the speaker. 


Nothing else happened and I left when the event was over, but fast forward to a couple months later and I get a call from an Unknown Number. I was in a meeting for work and I didn't answer it, but I later noticed I had a voicemail. It was Jerry, saying that he needed to speak to me and to call him back when he could. I tried to but because it was from an Unknown Number, my phone wouldn't allow me to call him back. Over the next few days I kept receiving voicemails from Jerry, seemingly rambling about random things. In one of them, he even spoke to me in spanish (my native language, he must have remembered me mentioning this to him, and figured I wasn't responding and if he spoke spanish I would understand him?).


Nothing else happened over the Holiday break but this week, I got a call from an IL number. I answered it, and it turned out to be Jerry. He spoke to me very excitedly for what seemed like 20 mins and I couldn't get a word in (like how did you get my number). He also addressed me as [my full name], and asked me if I lived in [State] (I was born there, but didn't say it). By this point I'm sure this guy has some sort of mental health issuse so I am being kind and responsive, I humored him for about a half hour random things he wanted to say, and then he told me he was trying to improve at the GRE so he could get into these schools. I gave him some pointers and then, after a while, I asked him how he got his hands on so much of my information. He tried to deflect but then he told me he got it off some website he couldn't tell me about but that if I gave him my email he can 'download a report and send it to me'.


After a while I told him I had to go (I actually did, I was at work again), and he said he would call me again to continue the conversation some other time. Yesterday I got a call from him (again, during work hours), and then left me a voicemail telling me he had found a picture of me and somebody and had a question to ask me. I know this sounds like the beginning of a horror movie, but I'm genuinely concerned for this guy. I looked up the # he's been calling me with online, and found an IL number with several complaints, including (paraphrasing) - ""some guy called rambling about random nonsensical things"", more than a couple of them with similar comments.


Unsure how to feel about the whole thing, but it is clear to me that the guy needs help and I don't know what to do--any thoughts appreciated.",25Jan2020,1
184,"How do I help my girlfriend?

Hi. I’ll try to keep this short. This girl I work with and me started dating 7 months ago. When she first began to work there, she had a boyfriend in jail but they broke up and then we became a couple a week later. She is 19 and I’m 25, so a lot of her issues probably are due to age. Anyways, everything was good in the relationship. We spent all our time together and loved being around each other. She was with me every night and pretty much all the time because we worked together. Other than her snooping  through my phone in fear that I was cheating on her, there was no problem. She said she was so in love with me and i was and still am in love with her. However, as soon as the ex got out of jail I figured out she spent a whole day and night with him, while ignoring me and saying she was out with family. I told her what I knew and broke up with her. She denied ever seeing him, but felt things were different and it wouldn’t work because I don’t trust her anymore. We kept hanging out though and she expressed that she loved me and wanted to work things out. After about a week, I just didn’t see the relationship going anywhere because my trust was fucked up, so I told her I was going to Miami for three days and then she flipped out. She felt like I abandoned her and didn’t love her anymore and went back to her ex.

After two weeks, the ex already fucked up and she was calling me back. We started talking again for two weeks and the first time we hung out I realized two other guys (one another ex boyfriend and one I’m not sure who he is) were texting her. Once we started hanging out again constantly, I no longer saw any other guys texting her except for the ex she had broke up with who blows up her phone all day everyday on fake numbers because she blocked him. She acted like she wanted to be in a committed relationship again, but I wasn’t willing to commit because she had just broke up with her ex and I wanted to make sure there was no mix feelings. Now it has been three months since then and we are always together just like we were before. I asked her last night if she wanted to be committed again and she said no because she was afraid I would leave her because I didn’t want to commit for so long (still not owning up to the fact that she saw her ex in October and that me leaving was really her fault) and I told her I didn’t want to commit to someone who likely had mixed feelings for two men, but now she seems to hate him so I’m more comfortable with commitment.Then she understood and said she wanted to be in a relationship again, so now we are a couple again.

I love this girl to death. She  is my first love and took my virginity. I know, a late bloomer I am. But it seems like she can’t be alone. She always has to be in a relationship. She even said when she is alone she starts having bad thoughts and she tried to kill herself twice before. She has no friends, doesn’t like to go out in public unless it’s for work due to social anxiety, and just likes to be in bed all day with me. I’m not sure why she decided to see her ex that day, but maybe it’s because younger guys will say stuff like “we will be together forever” where I’m older and more realistic and would say stuff like “if we are still together in three months...” which she would point out and it would make her feel insecure. Or maybe it’s because we are interracial (I’m white and she is black) and she has expressed concern about how her mom would act towards me. She definitely has low self esteem and I believe abandonment issues and that’s why me leaving for Miami triggered her so much. All her past boyfriends have been terrible to her. The first one cheated on her, the second one was physically abusive and almost killed her, and I’m not sure what this last one did. I know I’m taking a huge risk of getting my heart broken again, but I love her and I just keep in mind that she probably does love me but is very damaged at the moment so anything can happen. We even got matching tattoos with our initials while we were not “official” which was her idea. I know, it’s crazy lol. It’s just so sad that she is this way because she is absolutely beautiful (she models on the side) and is funny too. What type of issues do you guys think she is dealing with and what caused them? How can I help?",25Jan2020,1
185,"I went to this doctor the other week, and he kept on saying stuff trying to mess around with me.

He kept saying that because I ""looked smart"" that I should not get a tattoo since I should ""using my smarts to help the world"". he didn't even know much about me but was using some techniques to try and mess with me and defeat me. I know he wouldn't do this to anybody else, and he would get offended for me living like anybody else.  He's a coward then - if it's ""wrong"" for a person to get tattoos, why is it wrong for me? it doesn't make sense. 

I'm tired of it - I don't care about others' spiritual views and ways. don't tell them to me.",25Jan2020,1

187,"So to sum it all up quickly I have back issues I’m a 22 (M) who plays college basketball at a small NAIA school

Right now I can’t workout let alone play the game  I love and as I was doing my back exercises today and I just absolutely lost it. And I wanna kill myself all of a sudden. Like why Live when the thing I know I’m here for, what I love the most outside of my dog and family and friends, the biggest joy in my life, I can’t do, Nd I can see everyone getting better and I’m worse off? What’s the point? I know this is a lil dramatic and could be the heat of the moment but what I want to do for the rest of my life I can’t right now and it seems like no one understands and i just don’t know what to do. It just doesn’t fair, and I know I can fix it I know I can do it, but I’m just exhausted, and no one listens. So here I am turning to the internet 
Maybe this should be in a different thread but I figure  with the whole don’t wanna keep going thing this is a good place to start",25Jan2020,1
188,"First off, my husband needs all of these medications. If he comes off of them, he loses touch with reality and things get really bad, even dangerous (towards himself). 
Our sex life is suffering because of this. He is amazing and always makes sure I’m more than taken care of, but he simply does not get off and more often than not, he ends up in pain.
Realistically speaking, I know this isn’t my fault, but it really affects my self esteem to the point where I dread and even avoid sex. It’a extremely important to me that he gets off and every time he doesn’t, I feel myself shutting down a little more. This is made worse by the fact that we are trying to have a baby....

I love this man with all of my heart and can’t see myself with anyone else. How can I help him reach climax? He doesn’t have issues with getting an erection, just the end part. 
Any advice, links and books are welcomed. 

Thank you. 

TL;DR my husband cannot reach climax due to medication and I want to know what I can do in order to help him.",25Jan2020,1
189,"I apologise to coworkers,friends,relatives,strangers way too much. And I don't mean in a bumping into someone and saying sorry politely.

I mean if I get in an argument or altercation I'm always saying sorry first or trying to make up with people but fuck em. I'm not doing it anymore.

It's not my problem if you don't like me, I'm not keeping the peace anymore. When people threaten and shout at me, they should say sorry. I'm not a punching bag.

The thing is that I'm a pretty cheeky/jokey person and I don't mean any harm but people are just annoying",25Jan2020,1

I hope this is allowed. 
Do any of you have good tips or tricks, that can help you think more positively?
I have heard about writing three good things down every day, but I am interested in finding ways to improve positive thinking.

I just got dumped (Long story) and could really use it. Also, I think it just generally good to try to stay positive.",25Jan2020,1
192,"I'm not sure if that makes sense but whenever there is a constant background noise it sounds like a song. It happens when I am waking up too. So, like, this morning when I was showing and the fan was going it was playing a quiet live version of Casey Jones. Right now, the kitchen fan is going and there's soe rock song I don't know...maybe its something I'm coming up with or maybe its a song that I just forgot I knew. 

   I love music but am not super into specific types, I would never ask the music snob's famous ""have you even heard of them"" type question because I know my answer is almost always ""no."" When someone asks me what type of music I'm into the answer is ""any kind!""  It's so weird too because it is accompanied with a weird buzzing. 

I've been having extremely bad anxiety and have just recently gone through some pretty traumatic stuff. Additionally, have struggled with addiction but have been sober for some time now. Oh, also, I'm in isolation a LOT and feel like I have no one and am terrified of that. Maybe that's all what sparked this? I'm just worried something in my head just snapped. 

I apologize if this doesn't fit into this sub, I don't post often and have never really gotten the hang of it. Let me know if I should remove this, or, the regs might I guess!",25Jan2020,1
