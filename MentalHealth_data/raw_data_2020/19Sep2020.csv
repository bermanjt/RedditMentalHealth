1,"while I’m able to avoid these thoughts because I don’t want to cause any more problems than I already do for those in my circle lol, every so often I get urges to harm myself and lately they’ve been popping up more. I’ve been stressed but I don’t want to do it out of stress or sadness (I mostly feel numb,) I want to feel this and I want to feel something. I’ve had thoughts like this before but I use sex as a coping mechanism, not usually something like this and I don’t like the thoughts I‘m having. this isn’t something I want to tell my therapist. what can I do? can anyone relate?",19Sep2020,1
2,"i just opened my email for the first time in a while and wow i have some emails from teachers and i just noticed them now. i’ve been putting off school; the term started nearly a month ago and the most i’ve done is about two pages of notes for one subject, psychology. it just feels like it’s holding me back... i can’t stand it. i wish i had the motivation. i have ideas for stories and i like writing. i would be interested in doing acting too but i think i might have social anxiety and i know this sounds dramatic but it sometimes feels like it’s too late for that. i know it’s not true but you know. it feels as if i have to be ready to start uni in two-ish years BUT i would have to have actual experience in acting if i want to be let in otherwise they’d sooner accept a donkey. but anyway forget about that

i feel like i want to talk about the stuff i’ve written about in my posts over the past few months. my first one was here on r/mentalhealth and it was titled “i don’t know”. then after that things went whauUiJjJkIkkajajAAAA. i discovered r/scrupulosity and started being active there too. in april and july there was so much stuff that made me miserable that i spoke of there. i feel kind of messed up but i also feel like i’m secretly an attention-seeker or just trying to find excuses to run away from stuff like school and i’m somehow not noticing that.

on wednesday i think it was, oh and last week too, i was playing roblox and made a few friends, it was just nice light-hearted fun and :,,,)))

i feel like i want a break from school but idk if i need it... and if i did take one, what if it just turns into me not going back and pursuing something else?

a few days ago i just cried idk i felt worthless and thought about my stories and how i might never amount to anything and honestly idk if i was being serious but yeah. idk i’ve kind of become desensitised to self-deprecating talk so i just randomly say “i hate myself” but it doesn’t mean anything but does it? ugh yeah idk",19Sep2020,1

4,"i’ve been at college for five weeks, and i have no one. and i can’t fathom a single way that’ll change.

i’m just so stagnant and alone. every day is the same, i don’t even leave my room most days because my classes are online. everyone seems to have friends and i don’t know how they did it. i get eager for the weekend not because it means i’ll have time to hang out and have fun with people but because i’ll have time to lay in bed and throw myself a pity party because everyone’s out and having fun while there’s no one here i could even consider an acquaintance. i cycle through the same 5 apps every friday night and feel sorry for myself and it’s still the best part of my week.

there’s not even anyone to talk to about it. i have no one here. i don’t even think it’s because of COVID limitations. my school has strict rules to keep our cases low (such as not allowing people in your dorm, no one can have a roommate) but it’s still possible to have friends, i just don’t have any. even if we didn’t have socially limiting rules and if we weren’t in a pandemic i feel like i would still be so alone because i don’t know how people made friends. i had the best friends in the world back home and they all went to the same school so it’s not like the group is split up, it’s that it’s completely intact and i’m just not there. 

i literally have no one. my room is a dump. i’m not eating. i haven’t seen anyone in days. and there’s nothing i can do about it. i’m so alone and so hopeless. there’s just no way out of this. please help. how do people meet people how did i ever even make friends before god damn it

We manged  to recover from this financinal crisis and now we can afford buying decent food but my past is still haunting me, because of my past im now obsessed with food i think about food most of the time and when I feel hungry I get a panic attack because it reminds me of the hunger in the past so I lose my mind and I feel suicidal and desperate.

7,"Hi.
I’m a 21f

For nearly 2 years now I haven’t been outside doing anything.
I feel like I will soon go crazy, I was very social before and suddenly I started to not answer my friends back, not go to parties, just wanting to be alone all the time.
Now I don’t have contact to anyone since I just couldn’t text anyone back anymore, I couldn’t go out to parties I had nothing to talk about.
I sit Infront of my pc and if a friend tries to reach out to me I hate it, I ignore it or find an accuse to not go.
Is this normal depression?
The world feels so different to me now, I feel sick and light sensitive all the time.
I’m so confused bc I don’t feel totally depressed, I get up in the morning, make breakfast and then I just sit Infront of my pc, I cry only sometimes, but I live in misery.
Why don’t I want my friends or the outside world?
Anyone else?",19Sep2020,1

14,"I've had 4 sessions with my psychiatrist in the past two months, each session was around 45 minutes - 1 hour and I still don't know what mental health issues I'm dealing with. 80% is just silence because every time he asks me a question I give one-word answers.

I was already diagnosed with anxiety a couple of years ago by another psychiatrist. This new psychiatrist thinks it's more complex than just anxiety and it'll take some more sessions to diagnose me properly. He also told me to see a psychologist because only meds will not help me. 

I want to get better and want him to be able to help me but to do this I need to open up to him and be honest about the thoughts in my head, the things I do, etc. I just don't know how. 
I can talk easily with other doctors but when it comes to mental health professionals... idk what happens to me. 

Does anyone have any tips? Also, I think I might have ADHD because I have a lot of the symptoms, should I mention this to him or is it disrespectful and considered self-diagnosis?",19Sep2020,1

16,"Hi guys. I currently am diagnosed with OCD (more about obsessive thoughts than compulsive actions), and bipolar disorder. That being said the bipolar aspect had just manifested in the past year while I've been on Zoloft and Wellbutrin. They are currently taking me off Zoloft to go on Aripiprazole 50mg (I was in 100 mg Zoloft, sometimes 150). 

I also smoke sativa and indica fairly regularly. Like two to three bowls a day. That being said I have noticed while I've been slowly weaning off the one med to get on the other that not only am I losing weight, I also am experiencing alot of side effects like naseau, depression, sudden bouts of mania and anger, extreme hair trigger out bursts, and general being an ass sometimes. This wasn't how I was 2 weeks ago. 

So I went into my doc, here in Swansboro NC. He's been seeing me for about 2 years. Well it was later when I stopped in about 40 min from closing. They said go to the ER. I said the ER?! And risk COVID? I just want to know if this is normal and if I should stick with my new meds (only been on them one day). It takes 2 weeks I know. And because my state doesn't allow marijuana usage, I can't really get help in the regard of his it interacts. But I know for a fact I'm better in herb than not. 

Anyway, as a husband and father I need to get this anger and mania under control because my wife said I'm like jekyll and hyde. I was so happy and had way less anger. If any! Help please guys.

20,"So this is quite the diamond in the rough revelation but fuck it felt great. So I feel like I'm in the same boat as everyone else right now because of COVID, I'm distanced from everyone I care about. I'm about to fail a semester's worth of engineering classes, as far as relationships go, anyone I meet in person that I'd love to be in a relationship with either friend-zones me or I friend-zone them. 80% of the people I considered close friends I rarely make an effort to see because we're only distant friends now at best. But as I'm watching the stars with my knees digging into the chimney so I don't slip off, I realized how much I loved my friends. Not even the group of close friends I mentioned earlier, but the friends I see less than that. The ones that I look forward to seeing, but neither of us make an effort to see each other. I'm talking about the real ones. The ones that you just get along with. You may not hang out all the time, and that's fine. Honestly I don't even want that. I'm just looking forward to the next time we do. Because the really cool thing is this, I'm doing my thing (maybe terribly but I still am), and they're doing their thing. We couldn't do that if we saw each other all the time, but we're all progressing through life the way we want to, and that's really fucking cool.

22,"My friend (22, lives in Delaware) is going through a lot. He has been having some scary health scares but can't go to the hospital because his healthcare is crazy expensive. His dad has cancer so he lives with him and tries to help as much as he can. He works under the table with a very labor intensive job that he hates and sometimes works 60 hours a week (more or less). He didn't graduate high school, even though he did the full 4 years. This was because the system screwed up and told him he couldn't graduate because of a book he failed to get or return even though he tried to right the wrong (basically told him on the graduation day btw). It was really messed up, and his dad is trying to get him to sue. He knows he can go to adult school to get his diploma but he can't afford it. He also has depression, which is 100% understandable, and social anxiety. Because of his anxiety, he won't go to the DMV to get his license which makes things harder. He doesn't have a girlfriend (I don't think he's ever had one) and it bothers him a bit. I forgot to mention that he is an alcoholic. He won't admit it but he drinks almost every single day, and he drinks till he's very drunk. He obviously does it to try and forget about everything that's going on. Also, just to top everything off, he and his family don't qualify for Medicaid anymore (I forgot the reason, but he wasn't happy about it). I can't just talk to him and tell him it'll be okay, I know how this works. He won't feel better until he finds solutions and he's only getting worse. And it's not like he can afford a therapist.

Now to the actual subject, 
I don’t mean to brag or nothing but I can actually read people, like when someone tries to hide anything from me I instantly notice it, when someone tries hiding their emotions from me I may not be able to tell which they try and hide but I instantly realise something’s amiss.
This mostly causes problems in my social interactions since basically everyone is hiding something and I feel the longing to find out what it is, other people don’t like that and I don’t like the fact that they feel they have to hide parts of their personality/emotions from me.
I’m smart enough to know when I did something that affected someone negatively yet I’m not socially apt enough to realise what I could have done differently.
Until a few months ago I was a hardcore pothead and dulled my senses, partially for that reason and partially because that was the only way I could suffer some people in my life, however I’ve now been clean for a per longed period of time and my mind is Cristal clear and sharp enough to cut diamond.
It may sound arrogant as hell but I would give my left nut to be as dumb and dull as most people, just smart enough to interact with other people without making them feel uncomfortable/worthless or making me feel as if I were surrounded by a bunch of bonobos who somehow managed to string together a plethora of words wich somehow qualify as a language.
It’s really kinda fucked to be smart enough to realise how messed up you are, yet not socially apt enough to know how not to be.

34,"This is going to be a long story so be prepared if you wanna know how this ends.

Me (M/24), her (F/22)

We both know each other from childhood and our parents are relatively good friends themselves. Our first encounters I don’t remember, but she does. 
What I remember is we met randomly on the same vacation site (I was alone, she was with her family.) I was 18 she was 16. We just met us once and since she was with her family they invited me to explore the place together. 
After that, we didn’t see or hear from each other for about a year. But keep in mind, that I had already fallen for her. 
After a year or so I managed to find her number and texted her. We talked about how we lost connection after our childhood and talked a lot about my school, what she was doing and family business. Turns out, we were our “first loves”.

The first time was really great we were having a wonderful time. Due to cultural factors and personal beliefs we didn’t (or couldn’t) meet for almost a year into our relationship. 

In that one year we texted, I found out that she has a rather dominant character which I lacked. But it was okay, I guess. 

Now kind of a backstory to her:

She’s an only child. She grew up in a relatively wealthy household. 

She told me about her mother who was diagnosed with diabetes (idk if type 1 or 2, it’s the worse one.) since her pregnancy with her. Problem is, that her mother wouldn’t look out for herself, neither would she take the prescribed insulin, making her some kind of “nurse” since her early childhood. 

She still faces the consequences like panic attacks, some symptoms relatable to PTSD and so on. There are days, where the most little noise in the house would startle her and checking in on her mother. 

Her father is the kind of “I earn the money, keep track of the bureaucratic work in the house, that’s all I can/will do”.

That’s all about her so far.

Backstory of mine:

I’m the first and oldest and only male child of 4 of my parents. Our financial situation has always been crippling due to my fathers gambling addiction. My fathers absence at all times (he was only at home to sleep or to eat) led me to being some kind of father figure to my younger siblings. Even today my mom tells me that I am more of a father to the kids and more of a husband to her than he will ever be.

I graduated from high school the time we met and planned on going to college to become a teacher. Since my mom and I were practically alone raising the children, I am really left with none friends due to not leaving the house or engage socially in any way. 
I always had struggles making or maintaining friendships. 

The time I first went to college, my grandfather got diagnosed with pancreas cancer, which totally threw me off. I couldn’t follow in class, couldn’t even stay in the students dorm I rented. ( college town wasn’t far away from home.)
Which ultimately let to me failing every class and later on leaving. 

After half a year of jobbing and applying to new colleges I tried my luck again. 
But this time I got problems with my kidneys which had to be treated stationary in a hospital. Again; not attended classes, failed courses. 
Yet I am still engaged with college and trying my best to finish it by the end of 2021. 

Now; the marriage part.

We engaged a year ago. My father, who now doesn’t gamble as much as before, said from the beginning that he won’t be a financial help due to his debts of approx 10k€. My mother told me that the wedding had to be planned for 2022 if she was going to be able to afford it. I am working as far as my studies enable it to support her. 

Her parents were okay with it at the beginning but are now pushing for it to take place in 2021’s spring. 

Her mother, whom she is really invested in, is always talking about how short of a life she has left and how she wants to see her in “safe hands” before she dies. 

This has let to her supporting her parents and building pressure in me and my family. This pressure is tearing my mother financially and psychologically away, since she works double time now. 

Her dominant character has become even stronger since that. If I slightly say sth another than her opinion, I’m the dumb one, the one who never gets something done and the one not caring for her thoughts. Even if it’s like “somebody said X” and I say “well, maybe they didn’t mean it that harsh like you picked it up to be.” This kind of conversation leads to a discussion in 99% of the cases, resulting in days of little to none conversation between us even if I text her sth like good morning. 

In the last past weeks, she said things that shouldn’t be said in a relationship that’s aiming towards marriage. 

She said “if I didn’t care for what the people said or if I didn’t think my mother would be really sad, I would already have ended all the planing and this relationship.”
She said that she doesn’t want to be married and only does it for her mother’s sake. 

After these weeks I’m not even able to look in her eyes without thinking about her words. 

And I, myself, am not a man enough to say “oh really? Ok than I’ll do the decision for you and end it right here.” 

I really do love her, but I see her becoming a person that I cannot live a whole life together. 

But like I said, I’m not man enough to end it. She had enough trouble and sadness through her life and I don’t want to be a reason for more of it. 

We went out today and booked our place for the party, but idk man.. it doesn’t feel right. 

The fact that we are together for six years is frightening; leaving a person that became your life for your young adult years, or marrying someone that you thought you knew for six years? 

I am really in a shitty place for now... 

She constantly reminds me of what kind of a poor life (financially) we are going to have since my studies aren’t finished and I’m earning none to little money. 
That also puts me in a place where I can’t even say anything against her parents since they said that they will take care of our rent and supplies if necessary until I get my bachelor. 

The reminder of a “poor life” is such a burden on me that I even thought of leaving college to start a vocational training just to earn money.

But even that wasn’t good enough for her. 

She tells me to finish my studies but also complains every given chance about our future situation. 

“I’ll be embarrassed to the people” “i can’t even look into my parents eyes since I vouched for you” “I don’t know if you are the right man to be my husband” 
These are things I constantly hear from her. 

That + seeing my mother work her ass off + helping out to get the kids needs + her parents pressure are tearing me apart.

I’d really like to end all of this by saying no, but as I mentioned above currently I’m willing to sabotage my own life and future for her sake.

Even that will result in a insult like “I didn’t ask it of you” or “if you’re that unhappy you shouldn’t have done it”. BUT IF I DONT I AM THE ASSHOLE. 

I really don’t want her to suffer more than she already has, that’s probably why I’ll say yes at the wedding and wish and pray for things to get better than worse. 

That’s the end. If you read till now, I really appreciate it. 

I just needed a place to vent for a bit, since I don’t want my mother to know my concerns after all her hard work and sacrifice and can’t tell my sister (19) bc I don’t want to be a burden to her even if it’s just in her thoughts. 

I really feel stolen of my dignity as a male, really feel stolen of my “best years”, really feel FUCKING betrayed not only by her but most of myself for not being able to stop all of this. 

I’ll end this post with an inspirational quote as a wish to make things better and give you, the people who read all of this stuff, and me, the dumb one, hope for the future.

I don’t know what’s real anymore. I know that reality isn’t changing. I also know that my mind is going crazy. Sometimes I can’t tell if it’s just me in my head. It can’t be DID. That doesn’t make sense. It’s not schizophrenia because I only ever hear the voices in my own head. They feel like my thoughts, but from not me. I can’t explain it. It’s not multiples. 

I can’t focus. Too many competing thoughts. I have to, though. I have work to do. I can’t fail another class. Working on a bachelors degree. I probably won’t be able to pass. Haha.

I’m a 17 year old bisexual male. I’m attracted to men, and while my attraction for women is much less intense sexually, I’m still attracted to them sexually. 

For a while now, I’ve been watching gay porn exclusively. At first it was because I was actually horny, sometimes that still is the case, but now it’s just an escape....

I’m not even in the mood 90% of the time I start watching it, I’m just stressed out or bored. My erection is hardly an erection and when I put my mind on anything else other than the porn, It goes soft. I also try to make it last as long as possible before ejaculating because it’s the excitement I crave, not the orgasm 

Now I can’t get turned on by straight porn anymore. It’s only gay porn that my brain seems to want. I’ll start watching porn and then my brain thinks “why watch straight porn when you could watch gay porn”. 
It was not like this before, and now this just feels unhealthy and it’s also confusing me about my sexuality. 

I feel gross every time I finish, and that might also be the anxiety and stigma that comes with watching gay porn. The porn I watch has also become less and less normal (nothing illegal or anything like that) it’s just less conventional domination type porn. Usually when I watch the weirder stuff, it’s when I’m not actually horny and just want excitement, that’s also when I feel the most guilty after ejaculating. 

I have other hobbies and interests, I don’t know why this is taking over my life. How can I get back to normal? What does this say about me? Am I fully gay and not bisexual? I’m so stressed out right now.",19Sep2020,1

I’m adjusting to a new schedule and work 6 days in a row this week. I relapsed and started self harming again. It feels like life requires more of me than I’m able to give and have no desire to try anymore. I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to keep living life. I’m miserable. Went out for my friends birthday, and had a couple drinks. One of my friends offered to talk if I needed it and I broke down...in public. I thought I needed to get out of the house because I’ve been isolating a whole lot, but now I regret ever going. I hate this life. Any advice that would help me keep going would be appreciated. Thank you to anyone that read all this.",19Sep2020,1
42,"I’m a first year college student (18F).   I’ve been in a rough spot for the last few days and decided to drive home (about 30 to 40 minutes away) so I wouldn’t be cooped up in my dorm the entire weekend.  Most of the things that have been negatively affecting me are just related to me trying to adjust to college, and me trying to handle the workload for one class.  

I was sitting on the couch with my mom (49F) when I sighed and said, “I’m burned out.”

My mom goes off on how if I want to quit college she’d be fine as long as I went to the community college or get a job.  It ended upsetting me a bit and I almost cried.

When I said that I was burned out, I meant that I was tired and needed sleep.  I did not mean it to mean “I might drop out of college”

Before I went to bed, she said she wanted to talk about how I’ve been doing mentally tomorrow.  

I love my mom and I appreciate the support.  But sometimes she assumes the worst of things and blows it out of proportion.  Sometimes talking to her about my mental health feels like an interrogation.  I know her intentions are good but sometimes she isn’t very helpful.

I’ve told her once that something she did wasn’t helpful and my mom went off on how I don’t appreciate what she does and that she’s just trying to help.  

I really do appreciate the support from her.  But when I try to tell her “hey this wasn’t helpful, can you do this instead” she gets defensive.  

I find it easier to talk with my dad (49M) about my mental health.  I feel like I can be more open with him.  I kinda feel bad that I’m more comfortable talking with my dad than my mom.  I’m a girl, I feel like I should be more comfortable with my mom.  I know I’m not obligated to.  But I can’t help but feel a bit guilty for being closer to my dad.

TL;DR:  My (18F) mom (49F) sometimes blows my mental health problems out of proportion.  I’m not always very comfortable talking about my mental health with her.  How do I tell her that something she said wasn’t helpful without her getting defensive?  Is it bad that I feel guilty for being more comfortable with my dad (49M) than my mom?",19Sep2020,1

I just feel like everything sucks and humans are literally the worst, so why live? I daydream and fantasize about peace in death. Anytime I brought this up to other people I was called selfish. I’ve attempted numerous times and once in the hospital my preacher told me I was going to hell for it. There’s literally no point to anything. I can’t please anyone let alone myself.

So I recall a moment in my life that should have been more obviously a red flag, I have had several red flags but this one comes to mind most prominently at the moment. 

I was at a point inmy life, like many times, I was acting argumentative with people and just acting hyper and bizarre. I knew my behavior was costing me my job. At the time I was reading a lot of Aliester Crowley. I took a knife and carved a big pentagram into my stomach and began praying to not lose my job. A couple days later I hopped on a train and left almost everything behind to begin a new job in a new city with little to no plan. 

1. Obvious self harm
2. Seems rather delusional and psychotic

Over the last few years I have made a series of decisions and mistakes in my personal life and in my career that were just flat out stupid moves. Stupid at the time, and stupid looking back.

I knew what she was describing. It was what I felt almost every day. I gave her my advice on grounding techniques and she was feeling better within a few hours. But I wasn't, the techniques I use help me feel *More* connected but still I'm not all there.

56,"Hi, I have a roommate who is having a fairly tough time. A little background, he’s a refugee who resettled to the United States about five years ago. He’s been having delusions with concerns of people who might kill him or steal his identity. Some of these concerns have come up over the last several months, but my other roommates and myself thought it was a language / understanding of American laws issue. 

Over the last few days he has moved much deeper into the delusion and has certainly raised flags where I am concerned for his health. Yesterday one of my roommates found him with a knife on the couch crying and stuck in a loop about how his life has been destroyed. We called the suicide hotline without much success. Afterwards we called the psychiatric hotline and they indicated they can admit him if he comes to the hospital, if he willingly will go with parametric in the ambulance, or the police can forcibly remove him. We very much want to avoid the police taking him away as that is very clearly one of his huge concerns.

After his breakdown yesterday, he left the house and didn’t return last night. He came back tonight, and we have been trying to get him to willingly go to the hospital, but we have had no success. 

Does anyone have advice that might help us help him that doesn’t involve the police. I’m incredibly concerned if the police come the story will escalate and be a national headline that I don’t want to read.",19Sep2020,1

I also feel remorse(? or is it guilt) for not making the first impression of being the talkative, sociable one. Btw, it's not who I am, but I feel the need to become that.

Hi. I need help. I’m a 22 year old male and I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 last year. I’m taking my meds and I’m going to weekly therapy, but I’m still feeling suicidal.

Than at 8-9yrs old was molested by my sister.  I never told anyone one till I started dating my first husband. He told me she was just experimenting. It was always in the back of my mind. It never left me. Many many things happened to me along the way. Most importantly because of behavioral issues my Father abandoned me at 14 he was too busy fucking different women to deal with me. Now in this time as a child I had heard the grown ups talking about a female cousin that the Mother of that said child had been molested by her father at a very young age. All the family labeled her as crazy and was told to stay away from her. At this time none of mine was never revealed. I had many issues like drugs/alcohol. So I was labeled a druggie and talked about amongst the family  at this time noone knew of my molestations. My family was fanatical about religion hell fire and brimstone which I always rejected so I was made to feel ashamed I was labeled as a irredeemable niece and cousin.  Now I am 63 and just found out that the whole family has incest. Fathers molesting daughters brothers molesting sisters sisters molesting sisters grandmother molesting son grandfather molesting children   Daughter’s and daughter in laws being schooled to recieve sex from husbands regardless of their feelings and if they wanted it. I know that this sickness runs deep. Their is atm only 3 of us willing to tell the story but we know there are many more. I need serious couciling. I have not exhibited those type of behaviors but suffered from ocd, addiction,low self esteem, abandonment issues   Ive been to counciling and I hv been sober for over 10 yrs.

So recently things with life have quite honestly been hell. A lot of it stems from the ongoing pandemic and the way it's impacted my life and it's been the main reason that my issues such as depression and anxiety have been worsening rapidly. I stay up later (until 3 or 4 in the morning on average), sleep in more and waste my day away being unproductive. I skip meals and snack more, don't talk to my friends as much, and all in all just feel alone. It doesn't help that I'm going to college during all of this as well. Junior year so far has been me walking to class alone, sitting in a class that I don't feel motivated for or feel rewarded for working on, and walking back to my car alone since I rarely see any of my friends. Then I drive my 25 minute commute to the radio playing whatever my spotify playlist decides to play next. Sometimes I think about just driving into a oncoming semi and just finishing everything there. I used to not think of these things as often but recently I haven't been able to avoid them. I'm always drowning in homework because I'm not motivated to do it when it's assigned or I forget about it since I'm already stressed over a different class, I didn't even think that taking a semester off was an option until my dad told me that now would have been a good time to do so (fuck me I wish I would have). I just, I don't feel like anything I'm doing anymore has meaning, value, like it's worth it. I never think about my future unless it's a suicidal thought of me putting a bullet into my teeth. I just really don't know how much more I can take. And things are only going to get busier since my major (education) requires me to complete 60 hours of field observation and my professor only signed me up for 2 hours a week, meaning I have to talk to the person in charge and hope there's more spots that I can fill that don't sacrifice my dinner time, which is the only time I really see my family during the day. I just wanna give up. I want all of it to end and I just want to be at peace. If that means taking next semester off, trying to find more help (my usual counseling sessions on campus are unavailable due to coronavirus concerns), or simply finding a way to end myself, I really don't know anymore.

Recently I've been feeling kind of weird and I'm not sure if I need help and, if I do, where to turn to get it. When I was a kid I had a kind of not great childhood. My father is a recovering addict (over 14 years sober thankfully) so, despite being a genuinely loving father, he wasn't around for a lot of my childhood. Most of my early memories of him were either in halfway houses, him fighting with my mother, or seeing him and his then girlfriend (a great lady who had a large hand in making me who I am today) for a weekend or two a month. My mother is a really unpleasant person who treated my sister and myself pretty badly when we were growing up (highlights include telling me to drop out of school when I was 10 because I was just ""too dumb for it"", telling me that my Father died on Christmas because she was mad about something, and letting me know that, if it came down to it, she would put me up for adoption to stay in her current relationship). I know these things are pretty bad but the thing is it never really bothered me in the past. My older sister more or less took care of me as a kid and my father got clean shortly after I turned 13 so from that point on I was in a relativity stable and loving household. Lately though I've been finding myself dwelling on my childhood and I don't really know why. As far as I'm concerned I didn't have it half as bad as the people around me, I honestly feel bad kinda bad about even posting this here as it seems pretty insignificant compared to the other posts, and I've long since stopped feeling angry (or really much of anything) at my mother. I broke off contact with her a while ago when it came to light that she had begun to use drugs.vDoing this was not hard for me to do in fact if It didn't hurt at all and it still doesn't. I don't know why I'm feeling this way or why it's happening now (I'm in my late 20's for reference with a college degree, great friends, a good job, and I've always felt mentally ""stable"") and I'm not really sure if it's normal and I just need to feel with it or if it's an issue I need to address.  I thought I was past this, or more precisely, that other then a few things (fear of conflict and a lowish self worth) that most of this stuff just hadn't affected me. I've already talked to my sister about this stuff but I'm still stuck on it and I'm not sure what to do to move past it. I'm not sure if I need to see a professional about it and figured you I could use some advise or maybe that just typing this all out would do the trick and move me past it.

Sorry if this was kinda of rambling and thanks for taking the time to read it. I appreciate any advise!",19Sep2020,1
75,So ive been going to the gym for about 3 years now. Im not very good and everyone assumes im a beginner all the time. I go because I have a lot of energy and if I dont I lose my mind with my problem at home (the gym is my bandaid of sorts).,19Sep2020,1

78,"Because of some trauma from a few years back, I've sorta become a pacifist. The problem is that I can't defend myself anymore. Even when I was attacked a few months ago and could not bring myself to even throw a punch in defense of myself. I just shut down and accepted it. No fear of death or pain or well being. Just thought, ""I wonder if I'll die"" and dissociated from it. I used to be able to handle myself in a fight, but now I'm totally useless. My cousin has me go places with her when she's going to a bad side of town because she believes I'd keep her safe, and I really want to, but I'm afraid that I'd choke up and fail to keep her safe. 

I tried joining an MMA gym, and I'm tough enough to take as many punches as anybody can throw, but when I try to throw one back, my body pulls back and makes it real hard to follow through. It's either my arm goes weak (or like there's somebody holding my arms back when I swing) and refuses to give a real punch, or my arm is fine but my body pulls away not allowing my punch to make contact. I keep getting my ass kicked. You'd think that enough fat lips would convince me to step up and be okay with it, but nope. 

It feels like my nerves are burnt out. I feel nothing in the moment. I don't get adrenaline pumping like everyone else does. I don't get scared when I'm getting beat. I don't even particularly feel the pain. There's no sense of self preservation or self defense. It's like the longer I'm wearing the gloves staring at the guy across from me, the more I start to shut down. It doesn't feel real.

79,"Hello fellow Redditors, 22F who suffers with anxiety and depression here.
For the past week, I've had this terrible feeling. I feel like I'm just kind of numb and floating through life and space without a purpose. I've never hurt myself or thought about ending my life, but I'd much rather just not live anymore. If I could disappear into thin air I'd be so much happier. I really just want to be anywhere else but here whether it be a different state, country, planet, whatever. I just don't want to be *here*. This feeling sucks and I feel like I have absolutely no one to help me out of this funk. Could it have something to do with my anxiety and depression or something else entirely??",19Sep2020,1
80,"None of this is anyones fault but my own.

So I was at the gym, and Ive been going for 3 year but everyone sees me and thinks im a beginner because I have so little body awareness (i spent the good majority of my life dissaociated). I'm a trans guy (I pass) and im almost two years on T, but despite going to the gym and lifting for 3 years, im not very strong. Im like 140 lbs and bench 140 lbs. At least two times a week someone will ask me if I need help. I usually let them help but it hurts me because I feel like I should know how to do things by now. 

Since ive been getting a little better, i figured id venture out and try a little boxing.

I thought it was so cool because no one else did it, and I thought well ""hey this is neat! Even though im not as strong as the other guys, at least im kind of okay at this and its pretty fun."" 
I even bought myself some gloves for my birthday.

Well today four other guys were at the punching bags and they were doing really good! And I thought wow!! Cool! It hurt because I wanted to have my own thing but I understood and that was okay. But then they started giving me advice which I mean, its a good thing to do, but I'm already so harsh on myself. I just wanted something I could be kinda good at myself. They never left me alone and started boxing next to me and I caught them glancing over at what I was doing and it felt like they were judging me. And maybe they had good intentions but all anyone ever does is judge me. I stopped. 

I got hurt and I thought I could do something else no one did; rolls and handstands (which im usually okay at). Well after doing way more than I normally do i ended up landing on my neck and spraining it. I couldnt move for a moment but then I got up did one last cartwheel (i was not about to let anyone see me weak) and then drove home. Im now collapsed on my bed unable to move.


I'd KILL to just be a normal guy and have normal strength and not look like im a scrawny 16 years old. I would slam myself into the wall everyday five times a day to just be a normal guy. Im crushed. I dont want to box anymore. 

Im going back to the gym first thing tomorrow to practice until im better. I just wish I had thicker skin. Ive been crying for three hours.

84,"For as long as I can remember I've been severely depressed and nihilistic. I was raised in a very christian household, and from the get I was skeptical. I never told my parents about that part lol.

Most of my life has been spent playing videogames and watching YouTube, with the occasional anime. All of it is escapism. I have no close friends, and a few who try but don't get far. 

I know from some experiences we'll say, that I'm schizoaffective. It runs in my family on my mother's side.

I'm currently in my third semester of college, and I'm about to get kicked out. I'm failing all of my classes again, for the third time and they've had enough.
I know I'm not the only one but still, doesn't it feel like the world is just so empty? I know it only makes sense I would feel this way, having no friends, emotionally abusive parents, a selfish little brother.

I'm just tired of pretending I'm okay, just to hide away in my room for days at a time, watching everything fall apart and everyone drift away.

The world is such a joke. No wonder everyone's losing their collective shits. There's nothing left to fight for anymore. If you're happy, it's not enough. If you're sad, you'll kill to be happy.

85,"A friend of a friend of mine seems to be suffering from some form of schizophrenia over the past couple of years. As far as I am aware she has been able to keep on top of it up until about a month ago (could be longer my friend doesn't live in the same town as us anymore and they aren't as close as they once were so I'm unsure) as she has stopped taking her medication. She has been living alone in her family's house for some years now as her parents have split and literally live as far away from each other as is humanly possible on this Earth and neither seems to want anything to do with her and her mental problems. As is probably common with schizophrenics, she has creeped out most of her friends and doesn't seem to have any close enough to help her. She's convinced the government and her neighbors are trying to kill her and is often wandering the streets being confrontation with random people in the street. An acquaintance who lives near her paid her a visit as she wasn't answering any phone calls or texts and was being very strange on social media. She let her in and had her bags packed by the door preparing to travel to the West Coast (we live on the East Coast) where she has no family and apparently has no where to stay when she gets there.

How do we make her get the help she clearly needs before she does something of harm to her or someone else? Any suggestions y'all have would be of great help.

88,"So my husband came home late tonight (10PM) after a very long day of work. He was acting irritated, said it was work related. I suggested a shower to help him relax. He agrees and gets in. 

Eventually I hear the water turn off and what sounds like really loud breathing. I went in, and he is sobbing. Like full on. He went out into the living room and was wailing. I’ll be honest, it scared the shit out of me and I’m only marginally calmer now. I convinced him to go into the bedroom at least to avoid waking the baby, and he did, but full on wailing loudly for two hours. I thought someone died, he was so upset. He said he misses his parents, and mumbled some other things I couldn’t hear. Said he had been crying in his work vehicle for an hour before coming in. Then listened to someone reading Revelation and Timothy from the bible aloud on his phone. I rubbed his back and held him, got him water and food, and just sat with him. He’s quiet now, he just went into the living room by himself and seems a little calmer. 

I’m freaked out to be honest but trying not to show it. I think he should probably have an appointment with a mental health professional, since he is clearly having a hard time right now. Obviously right this second is not the best time to bring this up, but when he is feeling a little more recovered, maybe tomorrow, I think I need to bring the topic up.

When in bed, at any time, I use 1 earbud to make sure I don't miss out on any noises or anything weird. If I do hear any noises I start to get, well, paranoid (that's the word right) and start to think about what it could've been. Was it someone breaking in? A ghost making noises? A possible homeless guy doing weird stuff in my house? I don't know but I cannot recall the last time that I used both of my earbuds while watching anything that wasn't at my home.

102,"I have been a profectionistic procrastinator every since I can remember. School has been really hard for me not because I don't understand the material, but because I don't believe I understand the material. I often leave homework undone or half done and sometimes even redone because I'm worried that it's not good enough and this of course weighs heavily on my grades. But when I am tasked with doing a test in class and forced to put the petal to the metal most of the time I pass with flying colors.
 I wish someone would sit down with me every week and say ""hey these are the things that need to be done and this is how you are to complete those things"" but the real world (college) does not work like that and so I fight alone against my mind that tells me that I can't do the homework, that because I can't do the homework I will fail, and because I already know I will fail then there no hope because I'm a failure. 
Ive noticed that the way I respond to these thoughts is a pattern. At first I will hammer away at all of my classes (in anticipation of the thoughts), then the doubt and dread come in, then I motivate myself and push through. There always a start to my worries and a relief from my worries.

103,"The 22 years I've existed it seems I've constantly struggled with mental health issues especially controlling my anger. I will say I don't get angry around friends or in public and even if I get frustrated I can keep it internal. However, whenever I'm alone at home I can never seem to control it when it comes up, mostly from videogames. 

It seems that if things aren't going well such as not performing in a game or someone being toxic I get really frustrated/angry and lose my temper. No matter what methods I try such as breathing slower, counting to 10, or even just trying to reason with myself and convince myself its not worth getting upset about, nothing works and if anything it makes it worse. For some reason, it makes me more frustrated and angry when I can't control the anger and that I'm childish for having to walk my self through breathing exercises and things that were taught to me as an elementary school student. So if I can't follow these steps to calm myself down, and either way I reach some sort of anger peak what do I do? 

The main issue with my temper and rage is that it has caused me both financial and physical damage. From what I can remember I've punched countless holes in walls, broken at least $1000 worth of xbox, playstation, and game cube controllers, 3-4 laptops, and 3-4 gaming headsets. I also, when I'm really angry to the point of what feels like pure primal rage, I will bite or hit parts of my body. I don't know why I've developed this habit or if I got it from something but I really am scared I might do irreparable damage at some point. My hands are already constantly sore from playing video games a lot and one of the places I do the most damage is the part of the hand that's in between the thumb and the wrist. I'll bite as hard as I can on that part of my hand which unfortunately afterwards makes me feel better, almost like I've relieved some of that anger. Alternatively, I'll punch my legs or back of my head or use a controller. I'm really scared that one day I'll get so angry I'll hit my head more than I should or just completely loose it and not think about how much force I'm putting into a swing and really damage a part of my self.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like an easy solution would be to just 'avoid what makes me angry'. In theory yeah that would work but frankly almost anything can annoy or frustrate me when I'm doing something alone. Especially the things I enjoy doing the most. Like I said earlier I play a lot of videogames and tend to take them seriously, which is also something I could fix. Regardless, I play a lot of super smash brothers, and when I am just having an off day or whatever else could be rubbing me the wrong way I almost always lose it. When that happens I tend to avoid playing smash because I just don't want to deal with my temper. This happens in a lot of games now, even something as casual as minecraft or fall guys. Its sometimes like I don't want to do anything because I don't want to deal with being frustrated or angry and it seems that no matter what I try to do I will have to confront my rage and I just really don't want to.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, after all is said and done and I've had my childish tantrum over something trivial I almost always feel defeated and depressed which makes everything worse. The other competitor in the never-ending fight to make me miserable. Especially if I break something expensive, I'll feel depressed for days on end. I'm a loser that can't deal with their childish anger and I annoy and scare my family as well. I really don't want to deal with any of these emotions any more. I hate the depression, anger and hopelessness that comes as well because it feels like nothing and no one is able to help. I don't know what to do, who to talk to, anything. I've gone to therapy for the last 10 years or so and have seen little to no results. Talking to family or friends provides no advice that resonates with me. I'm lost and tired and just want some answers to this pathetic issue, something to click that resonates. I feel like im asking for some magic cure-all and in a particular sense, I guess I am. I come to realize that the only one who can help me is my self. However, I fail to be capable to help my self work through these issues. So that being said if I can't help myself who can?

So a month ago I had a car accident which almost was deadly. To not make it too long, I got hit by a car, ended up with few bruises, but I was close to dying, it was a matter of being one second slower.


I noticed that my memories from this day became really blurred and hazy and lost their details really quickly. Just few hours later I had troubles telling what exactly happened. I've heard that it might just be because of trauma, so I didn't bother, just kinda wished that I could see recording of the accident to know how right me memories are.


Fast forward to a week ago, I met for the first time with my boyfriend, we're in ldr and I love him a lot, he's my first partner. I had the greatest days in my life, I don't remember being so happy ever. But we had to say goodbye.


It was on Wednesday. Now, just few days later, I noticed that my precious memories are getting hazy and losing their details. I'm having troubles remembering how did I lose my virginity with him, I remember only few details. It's like if each memory was a paint of different color, but my brain mixed all of them into this chaotic stain.


I'm scared, I don't want to lose those memories. I don't know what's happening. Is it normal? Is my brain trying to protect me from emotional damage (saying goodbye was extremely hurtful) by making me not remember this happiness? I didn't get any brain damage during accident, that's sure, but I never had it before it. I'm also very dizzy lately too while this is happening.

A little more than a week ago I was on Facebook at work, and even through she blocked me years ago, I came across my ex profile (friend of a friend), since then it's like I was gone 10 years in the past, like it happened yesterday.

It's been a week and it's not going away, I check mist of ptsd symptoms, it's becoming hard to work and my gf don't know what to do, I told her I wasn't well but I don't know how to explain it to her, I'm afraid it will hurt her.

The obvious thing to do is to go to a therapist but I don't know how, I'm crying just writing this, how can I speak about it to someone I never saw before?

113,"I tell myself that I’ve been doing so well. I’ve been taking medication for a month now and I don’t really know if it’s working. It probably is cause I don’t feel as much fatigue. But I still can’t sleep. It helped but it also made me realize that there are things that can’t be changed just by taking some prescription drugs. I feel really lost when I have this realization. Funny thing is I feel like it’s harder to cry now too. I don’t even feel sad now, I just feel depressed. I know I can’t trust my thoughts whenever I’m having an episode. But my thoughts always make sense, like all the bad thoughts I have make sense and they are logical. How everyone probably hates me, how they probably already know I’m pathetic and depressed no matter how hard I try to hide it. how I’ll probably end up being no one doing nothing in the future. I skipped a night’s sleep just so I could sleep at a normal time and hopefully have everything adjusted and I end up staying up till morning the night right after. I hate that I have come to write something like this too cause it always seems like a last resort that does something but really nothing.

114,"so, i’ve been suffering really bad from depersonalisation and bad anxiety for around 3 months now. before this bad spell, i was at my happiest and felt amazing - i was so happy, mostly anxiety free (i did have bad flare ups and intrusive thoughts every now and then but i was just SO happy and care free). i had a panic attack about death 3 months ago and since then, my mental health has taken a downstairs spiral. 

basically, these three months started off with being scared of dying. what happens when we die? omg one day i’m not going to be here! - it would make me feel so hot and flustered, so dizzy, and not be able to breathe. this started this depersonalisation feeling, which hasn’t left since. i’ve managed the thoughts of dying now - i’ve kind of came to terms of it and try and not let it affect me. however, when i do think of it, i feel very hot and panicky but can calm myself down quite quickly. which is good. 

the new thing im worrying about is going insane. getting psychosis and schizophrenia. this is genuinely making me PANIC. this is because ive been researching a lot about my anxiety, reading forums, people’s stories, etc. my biggest fear is now losing my mind, losing my touch on reality. i read something that said ‘you wouldn’t know if you were going insane or had schizophrenia, people with anxiety are too in touch with their emotions’ - so now i’ve started to feel extremely paranoid. i cant even explain it. i’m paranoid that i ‘don’t know how i’m feeling’ even though i do. i clearly do. but i just feel so detached and physically sick constantly, because i am SO worried about getting this. i sometimes even throw up because of this. like, i’ve read about schizophrenia and it’s like ‘you think people are watching you, and are out to get you, your family are gonna kill you etc’ - i’ve never felt this way. but now my mind is going into overdrive and i think i’m making myself feel this way. when i feel particularly anxious, every sound i hear triggers me, my family talking makes me feel really hyper aware, i just feel so hyper aware and panicked. i just can’t calm down, it’s like a constant panic attack and im terrified. i just want to feel normal and not have racing thoughts all of the time. my biggest fear is ending up in a psych hospital or trapped away forever. i just don’t want to go insane or crazy or get psychosis or  schizophrenia. how do i stop?!?? am i ok? ☹️",19Sep2020,1

Why do I have to fight through the struggle, just to live a 9 to 5 lifestyle. 

I was born Christian so when I feel like ending it all, I can’t help but think of Hell. It really makes me hate God for being “the Almighty” but couldn’t save his people from this torture?

130,"I’m a random guy who runs a business from home and dealing with stress during the day. Half a year ago I started a diary. It changed a way I think about myself and “woke me up” in some way.

It made me open to trying other “free tools” that are popping up here and there on the internet. The only thing I miss is support from others who do/learn something similar. But we can connect and share our experience.

**Breathwork**

There is emergency breathwork you can do to calm down. Once you feel overwhelmed try to extend your breath for 7 seconds and then release it for another 7 seconds. Your body goes to the parasympathetic nervous system that is responsible for the body's rest \[1\]. And your heart rate gets down. Use this in a stressful situation or if you go to sleep after the hard day.

But we need something more powerful to deal with regular stress.

There are many variations of breathwork. You may know about pranayama (yoga practice) or holotropic breathing. In general, breathwork is a process when you isolate your breath from any physical activity and do only it to push your body above previous oxygen limits.

**The Wim Hof Method**

I learned about the Wim Hof Method by watching the Joe Rogan Experience podcast \[2\]. This technique consists of three rounds. You do deep breathe for 40 times and hold it for as long as you can’t. Then you release, inhale and do one more hold for 15 seconds. That’s round one. There is even a video where Wim Hof guides you \[3\].

Laird Hamilton shared a story behind the method \[4\]. He said Wim Hof’s technique is a derivative of a Himalayan breathing technique called “Tummo”. It was developed by monks to keep their body temperature in the right condition in a cold environment.

Mister Hof says breathing is about changing chemistry.  “When you saturate cells with more oxygen then you typically need, your body stores it. And your body’s chemistry becomes alkaline. That enables control of all the body systems — immune, endocrine, lymphatic, vascular, etc.” 

“Oxygen influences the body’s chemistry by balancing it in affected areas. Scientists agree with me, doing psychotherapy is not enough to reduce stress. You should also work on your chemistry” \[5\].

There are some scientific papers behind the method \[6\]. Which makes it even more interesting to try.

**Let’s connect and run an independent study**

I would love to share my results and get data from others. How did we feel before that? What experience we had by using the method? How did it change us? And so on. 

I encourage those of you, who also deal with anxiety/stress or have problems with sleep. Let’s connect and run an independent study on the breathwork.

132,"Hello friends. To get to the point: Since I forgot to lock the bathroom door of a restaurant and a girl walked in on me (I had finished, but it was still a shock), I started to check every lock twice, or three or four times. Since my cat jumped out of the window, I check the windows twice or more times, too. I also lock the car three or four times on average. 
I check if I closed the locker in the riding stable, which means I have to walk about threw minutes, even tho I checked it double when I closed it in the first place, to prevent me from going unnecessarily. I KNOW that I locked it, but I can't do anything about it.
As well as I know that I closed the gate to the meadow, but I still turn back to look after ~twenty seconds. At least only one time.
It's nothing that bothers me too much, except for the fact that I manage to be too late or don't catch the train or have to hurry like hell. Not always, just sometimes, but it'd be preventable. 
I managed to stop checking more than twice if the bathroom door is closed. I even manage to check only one time, or not at all, but then I am extremely anxious when I'm sitting on the toilet.
What fuels this obsessive behaviour is 1. my shitty memory - but I also check if I KNOW and REMEMBER that everythings fine - and 2. paranoia. What if the cat jumps out of the window again? What if someone steals the car? What if the horses escape? What if. 
But even tho I know what's the problem, I can't stop. Well, sometimes, with enough force, but then I am extremely anxious. I should have checked, I think. I forgot it this time, I think. Maybe I am not too late then, but I am not concentrated. 

Still, for me, that doesn't seem as if it was worth talking to a therapist. Just something I had to figure out how to get rid of. But now I am starting college and ask myself it it's worth it missing the train, coming too late, maybe even to exams or interviews for internships, just because I feel unbothered enough not to see a therapist. 
Problem is, my insurrance would only pay if I have a proper diagnosis. Does such rather harmless OCD count? 

(Funfact: I am arguing w myself rn if I should go check whether I locked the locker. I did. But my ass wants to go look anyway.)",19Sep2020,1
133,"Online world is getting crazier day by day. The Me Too movement started of great, with actual harrasers getting outed, but later it changed into lynch mob.

Even after two years, people who were absolved of the charges are facing the brunt with random people going back and posting old links before their absolution claiming them to be sexual predator.

All it takes to ruin someone's life is one post. Just one post. No one cares about the other side of the story.

134,"(This port has some bdsm-y themes in it, I hope I can post that here! )

I've been in a toxic relationship with a 'dominant' man online for a little over two years now, on and off. 
 
It started when I was 19 (and he was 27). Back then I was curious about the online bdsm community and thought I'd try it out myself. We met online, we were both looking for the same thing and we got along pretty well. 

The problems started because he had a tendency to ghost me constantly. He'd just stop replying in the middle of a conversation and then disappear for weeks - which would result in me getting unreasonably upset and I'd end up bombarding him with texts till he replied. (Which is very unusual for me, I don't show this behaviour with literally anyone else) 

This cycle would keep repeating and each time he would promise a 'fresh start' and talk about how attached he was to me, how he wanted a 'relationship' with me etcetc. And I would just stick around like an idiot. 

It would end up feeling like he only used me to get nudes from me, that's the only time he showed real interest. We would have times of normal, fun chatting too but it was usually cut short because he'd be 'busy' so he'd just stop replying. He used to act oblivious about it initially but the more I called him out on it the more pissed off his reactions used to be and he'd call me crazy for bombarding him and ranting like a 'bitch'. 

One time I completely spiralled out of control and got really toxic when he ghosted me for months. I ended up finding an insta page of his dog he told me about (which was very creepy of me to do) - but the account was run by a woman and she was definitely his girlfriend at some stage because her insta had a picture of them in a relationship. 

I'm still not entirely sure if they're in a relationship together but I don't understand why they'd get a dog together otherwise? I even asked him about it straight up because I felt terrible for stalking him like I did. His response was, obviously, that it was none of my business, that he was done revealing any more details of his life to me and that he's saying he isn't in a relationship so I should take his word for it and shut up. (There was a big possiblity he was in a relationship otherwise too - because we've never even spoken on the phone, he rarely took pictures for me, and he disappeares after his false promises)

Anyway we moved past that because I had to 'make it up to him' by sending him nudes (like I'm some object) but then the cycle would start again. The toxicity would get worse every time and keep building up - I started to give him missed calls and more text bombardments when I knew he was avoiding me. 
Right now we've ended it completely - we've both blocked each other on all our chat apps. 


Is there any way I can figure out why I did all this and got so attached?
Have I been completely unreasonable and creepy in how I've acted? When I look at it objectively, I think it's all been really fucked up and I've been used and objectified and I've been awful as well. 
It's like I hate him but I still want to go back to that relationship. It was so frustrating because anytime I'd vent about how upset he made me he'd just ignore it or call me crazy. This unfeeling attitude would make my ranting worse because it's like he didn't care for me at all. 

Why am I still in a state where I blame myself for this going wrong and still give him so much value? Why do I still crave his approval and want him to care? What do I do? I'm so lost!!

Then ended up in hospital for 7 days, got released after that with antidepressants and sleeping pills and antihistamines for anxiety. Got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. And 3 days ago I tried the same thing. Only this time I didn’t have so many pills at disposal and it was only antihistamines (10 pills) and alcohol. My SO called an ambulance again and when I woke up there, I freaked out and took needless out of arms and took off. Had a bad fight with my boyfriend after that when I came home, he even called police on me, but they just came checked us out and left. 
But anyway, long story short between February and now I was doing quite well, taking antidepressants in the morning and these other pills when needed. Now question is, why am I going in circles?! Why is this happening all over again?! It’s like my mind gets darkened completely and am out of any control. Then I turn to alcohol for some calming effect but it turns to hell.

It was my first intense anxiety attack and thought I was dying. The way they seemed to not give a shit (for lack of better terms) and roll their eyes at me, and treat me like I'm over-reacting only makes me feel worse.

I have chest pain. I have had worsening chest pain since March time. I have been to the hospital easily 30 times for investigation but every time it is ruled none cardiac. I am so dizzy I feel like I will lose consciousness at any minute and I feel like my heart is going to stop. 

I've been told I have heart anxiety. I have a phobia of my own heart and I cannot function. 

I cant walk, I cant feel emotion - all of these things end with my visiting the hospital with 'heart' pain.

ECG
Blood Tests

144,"I have a 2 year long relationship with a person I deeply love, but I assure you the path hasn't been soft. My boyfriend was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder many years ago, much prior to our relationship, when I meet him he was in a very unstable phase, deeply depressed and didn't know how to handle a commitment. Regarding his personal life, he couldn't have a job, there was weeks where he barely leaf his room, he didn't sleep or ate for days in a row because he was heavily anxious and paranoid, passing out episodes were not that rare. With time, the right treatment/therapy and a good support base that he was having from me, he was able to get his life back.

Nowadays he has a full time job, a good sleeping/eating schedule, he's much better regarding our relationship in all aspects as well, same for social life, and he's doing well financially too... basically, everything as made a turn for the better. Now, thing is, he has a quite stressful job, with a good amount of responsibility. He's fighting to have a better position and earn more, but that's just stressing him a lot. He has been working more extra hours, and talks about how stressful it feels all week long, he feels tired almost everyday. Recently he commented with me that sometimes he felt withdraw effects from his medication, as if he didn't took it, but then when he checked he confirmed that he actually took it and the symptoms would eventually go away. Usually that happened when he noticed he had done a mistake on work, so, he believed it was purely just anxiety. I believe that, but, I'm concerned about it. Stress is one of the main factors for a psychotic break, for a mental break in general, and he's already showing symptomatic signs that he's not feeling that well.

I've spoken my concerns to him, I've told him that he didn't need to put his health at risk for a promotion, or to prove something to anyone, but I know he just wants to prove it to himself. I don't know how to make him rethink his approach, I don't want him to think that I don't believe in him and in his potential, because I obviously do. I just don't think it's worth to risk another relapse when he has done so much already. 2 years ago he was suicidal, if his path towards now wasn't successful Idk what it is. We all need time to breath and stop sometimes, with or without mental issues. Obviously, on his case, taking in account his health issues, I'm specially worried. I love him a lot, maybe I'm also worrying too much, but I'd like to find a way to help him see that he's enough, every single day, not just a productive day but I don't know how I can do it or if I should do it.

I think that everything doesn’t exist, what I touch, see, hear, everything it just don’t exist. Before my family moved, I’ve been seeing shadows.

My parents think it’s my vision, i have myopia and I am having my myopia treated, so I thought that too and I’ve grown used to them to the point I ignore them and don’t pay any attention to it.

It’s just now in quarantine that I’ve been seeing them less, but start to hear my mother calling my name when she’s not and feel anxious about living in another county. The neighborhood is quiet and empty like the last neighborhood I was in, but it just don’t feel right. I never go outside and rather stay in my room the whole day, but I know I have to come out at least care for myself with less motivation to do so. I feel like I’m being watched, and sometimes I try going up the bed trying to avoid whatever is under my bed ready to attack me, the same thing as the garage I quickly get what I need and exit as soon as possible.

So it led to the point that I think my house is haunted because it would get like this almost everyday, except the voices because i hear them sometimes, more when I’m sleep deprived because I’m starting to not sleep as much as I used to.

151,"I realized I daydream a lot, usually about characters I like (sort of like fanfiction except i don’t write it?) I think if I’m not doing school work, then most of my day is literally just spent sitting or pacing around daydreaming. Like I have a book I’ve been trying to read for 2 weeks, but I feel like I just can’t get myself to read it as I get too distracted with my daydreams. I also almost never finish videos or books because I get distracted by a daydream. 

During school I had to do independent work, but I got distracted again by daydreaming and music

I also noticed that I not only listen to a lot of songs, but just movie or show scenes in general that fit with my thoughts. Like, I’ll be watching a show that’ll have a scene of someone saying something, and a lot of times I’ll automatically think “This goes perfectly with “this daydream” and then I’ll play that scene along with songs that go with my daydreams usually while pacing around my house (I think my family must think I’m possessed or something since I just spin in circles, or if there’s people around I’ll lock myself in my bathroom and pace in there which makes my family mad)

I now mainly only listen to music that goes along with my daydreams

153,"Since late primary school I’ve struggled with anxiety and mild depression, and recent traumas have made it more difficult for me to control my self worth and suicidal thoughts.

Recently I’ve noticed that whenever I have a somewhat difficult time in my life, suddenly my mind becomes really negative and I lose all self esteem. I forget all the good things in my life and what I’ve managed to accomplish, and my mind just focuses on the negatives. I have epilepsy, and recently I was living a good life seizure free and controlled with medicine, but one little random seizure happened and everything just came crashing down, I thought to myself- what’s the point in continuing if my epilepsy will just get worse and worse? I’ve also moved back to my small hometown recently, and a conversation with my boyfriend about why I don’t really go outside in my hometown was a little bit awkward, and I just thought- why would he date someone like me, I’m so messed up compared to him.

This immediate negative mindset results in me doing things that I don’t want to do, and with hindsight later I deeply regret how I coped in these situations. I’m tired of pushing my relationships away, I’m tired of feeling proud of myself one day for me to feel like I’m a monster the next. What can I do to control this?

157,"Hi all, I'm not sure who to talk to about this so I figured I could hopefully get some advice here. I'd like to give some backstory first.

I am an 18 year old male and, like so many other people, have had a rough year. First off, my senior year got cut short, which wasn't the end of the world but it really did suck. But I was able to keep my head up knowing that I got to go to college in the fall. But as the summer progressed, I realized that wasn't going to happen either. Currently, I am living at home going to college online and will be for the foreseeable future.

The reason I'm in this subreddit is because I don't really feel like myself. For a moth or so I was in a pretty sad place, but at this point I would describe it differently. I am easily irritable and have a lot of pent up stress and worry. I normally am a daily positive and happy person, and I am definitely a people pleaser. I avoid conflict at all costs, no matter how small. Normally that's fine, but since I feel so irritable, whenever something annoys me, or makes me sad, I bottle it up. 

 
As I type this out I feel like it sounds ridiculous, but I really just don't know how to describe it. Long story short, I feel like I'm prone to frustration and sadness, and I don't feel like myself because of that. If anyone has any advice I would really really appreciate it.",19Sep2020,1

164," So... over a week ago I spoke to the head of a counselling group in my area, and they said they'd match me up with a counsellor and get back to me to organise a session. When I heard nothing, I sent a follow-up email a few days ago to ask when this will happen and if it's still going ahead... and theyve still promptly done nothing : )

I contacted like 10 counselling places nearby... this group did that,  one of the private ones is unavailable for over a month and only doing virtual sessions (which Im not really comfy with) and well... the rest (besides 2 who I have yet to speak to) said nothing (Ive emailed them all twice and even gotten my friends mum to leave a voicemail... and gotten radio silence in response) 

Kinda annoyed at the provision (or lack thereof) of help if Im being honest! I would have thought theyd want clients anyway... isnt this a business? 

People with depression tend to find it really hard to ask for help and feel very despairing if they finally manage to and then don't get it,  and often might not have the energy to chase things up this much...  really not great I dont like to think how many depressed people might end up feeling that  the help isnt there, or feel rejected and less likely to ask for help  again, or are too tired to fight tooth and nail for a response in this  situation I have two more who actually scheduled an initial appointment and that I  can talk to somewhat soon at least, so... there is some hope (unless they do the same thing as this group or also aren't free face to face)

Just... anyone out there who is experiencing this as well, know that I empathise and really feel your frustration! But DO NOT GIVE UP - as much as what I said above is true and I think its wrong for people with depression to be forced to jump through all these hoops... just please keep trying to. You owe it to yourself and they owe it to you to respond... eventually.",19Sep2020,1

166,"I have a 2 year long relationship with a person I deeply love, but I assure you the path hasn't been soft. My boyfriend was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder many years ago, much prior to our relationship, when I meet him he was in a very unstable phase, deeply depressed and didn't know how to handle a commitment. Regarding his personal life, he couldn't have a job, there was weeks where he barely leaf his room, he didn't sleep or ate for days in a row because he was heavily anxious and paranoid, passing out episodes were not that rare. With time, the right treatment/therapy and a good support base that he was having from me, he was able to get his life back.

Nowadays he has a full time job, a good sleeping/eating schedule, he's much better regarding our relationship in all aspects as well, same for social life, and he's doing well financially too... basically, everything as made a turn for the better. Now, thing is, he has a quite stressful job, with a good amount of responsibility. He's fighting to have a better position and earn more, but that's just stressing him a lot. He has been working more extra hours, and talks about how stressful it feels all week long, he feels tired almost everyday. Recently he commented with me that sometimes he felt withdraw effects from his medication, as if he didn't took it, but then when he checked he confirmed that he actually took it and the symptoms would eventually go away. Usually that happened when he noticed he had done a mistake on work, so, he believed it was purely just anxiety. I believe that, but, I'm concerned about it. Stress is one of the main factors for a psychotic break, for a mental break in general, and he's already showing symptomatic signs that he's not feeling that well.

I've spoken my concerns to him, I've told him that he didn't need to put his health at risk for a promotion, or to prove something to anyone, but I know he just wants to prove it to himself. I don't know how to make him rethink his approach, I don't want him to think that I don't believe in him and in his potential, because I obviously do. I just don't think it's worth to risk another relapse when he has done so much already. 2 years ago he was suicidal, if his path towards now wasn't successful Idk what it is. We all need time to breath and stop sometimes, with or without mental issues. Obviously, on his case, taking in account his health issues, I'm specially worried. I love him a lot, maybe I'm also worrying too much, but I'd like to find a way to help him see that he's enough, every single day, not just a productive day but I don't know how I can do it or if I should do it. In the end, it's up to his decision.",19Sep2020,1
168,"I'm completely losing my grasp on reality. It's beyond just running stupid scenarios on my head, I'm afraid I'm going to act on these incredibly bizarre and pointless urges I have. For example, all over my Facebook and TV all people are talking about is pedophilia and child predators. Constantly. Nonstop. Article after article after article. I read some at first because I like reading the news but now I'm ocd about it. I have to know more, I have to know everything. I get so uncomfortable reading it and it makes me sick but if I stop I get even more nauseous because I can't fight the urge to DO something like read or research. The subject matter is disgusting and upsetting, and I don't actually want to know more and yet I constantly do. Every link is like a rabbit hole and I end up learning about something that sticks in my head. Now I'm afraid of what my next urge could be. I read about the dark web or whatever, and now I'm afraid I'll end up learning how to access it and everything and then finding myself on there when I don't want to / care about it. Or I read about a really upsetting ""meme"" related to some awful video someone forced a child to make and I'm afraid I'll end up seeing the video, or the authorities will arrest me for looking up info about it... But the thing is I don't WANT TO. It feels like someone is holding my hand over a stove. I get do anxious and start sweating and freaking the fuck out, shaking and pretty much crying unless I research things. And then when I do, I calm down but feel a deep sense of regret and pain because I had to ""give in.""

The subject matter is constantly changing. A couple weeks ago, it was drone strikes and war crimes. Before that, it was Warhammer 40k lore. The list goes on. It's always something and I can't control it. The current thing is really destroying my head because I am so sick to my stomach reading about these horrible things people do to children and I'm so scared to have to learn more or end up in a place that has something like that, be exposed to it, and even if I report it I'll never be able to scrub my memory of it. I don't want to see anything like that but I'm afraid by reading so many articles I eventually could end up on some website that has it by mistake. It's driving me insane. I only have peace when I'm completely asleep. Even if I distract myself with a game or movie, the thoughts come back in the middle of it and I freak TF out. 

I need serious help and I have no one IRL except an elderly parent who can't help me. I'm completely alone and afraid. I want to go to a psych ward just to be isolated from everything but I know they'll just kick me out after 2-3 days. I don't know how to go and be kept long term for months or years. Medication will make my condition worse but I don't care as long as I'm just put in a room and kept away from all books, TV, internet, etc. Does something like that exist? Who do I have to talk to?

Hi R

You see, I have been in love with the same person for 3 years and the truth is that things never worked out, we were never a couple and she is doing her normal life like anyone entering and leaving relationships but I have given a lot of importance to what I keep having feels because the truth is that he was the first person I fell in love with.

 and because I have not overcome the feeling and sadness that I have never been able to take the relationship to another level, I want to feel better about myself and give myself the opportunity to know to other people and then in the future to have something with someone else other than her but it really makes me very difficult since my mind constantly reminds me that I failed with her and I am discouraged from trying something new.

171,"Hi. :(
I know how bad self diagnosing is so I won’t tread that category, but if there’s anyone on here who has OCD, or knows anything about it or even has something similar, may I please have your second opinion on this? My mental health has been going down a drain and I’m afraid this is worse than I precedented.

Here are some things I’ve been experiencing:

1. I have health anxiety, but recently I’ve been noticing washing my hands constantly after touching anything or anyone who is a stranger to me, in fear I’ll be getting a deadly disease. I’ve literally made my hands raw and rough from all the soap multiple times.
2. I now have intrusive thoughts, which destroy me from the inside out. I don’t want to get into it but they’ve made me have terrible breakdowns that I really cannot explain.
3. I am constantly...paranoid? Thinking the food delivery guy poisoned our meal, thinking the man who rang the doorbell may be a bad guy, thinking my cat will knock nail polish off my desk when I’m asleep and lick it and die, thinking my cat, who I know is upstairs, is in the bedroom/bathroom I was just in so I’ll have to recheck it again and again just to make sure she’s really not being trapped inside, you know, in case my large cat is behind my small toilet, thinking if I don’t check both of my pupils before I go to bed, I’ll miss the chance of a stroke or seizure or whatever kind of brain injury because one of my pupils will be much more dilated and I won’t know unless I check, having one major health anxiety flare up that lasted four months with panic attacks every day cause I thought I had rabies for literally the most baseless, nonexistent reason, and I proceeded to go through the most horrific time of my life with an unbelievable amount of guilt thinking that I’d doomed my parents too, thinking if I don’t pick up the T-Shirt that fell on the floor, that I’ll become a victim to karma for not....picking up a shirt. Rechecking whatever my brain tells me I need to recheck, like the bathroom door a hundred times, or if the bedroom doesn’t have snakes slithering on the floor a hundred times or if the window isn’t open a hundred times. The list goes on.
4.I maladaptive daydream a LOT.

I don’t remember anything else, but these are the more major ones. I know we shouldn’t diagnose each other, but I’d really appreciate it if someone could give me their opinion :( This is getting so tiring. 

*BTW, the increase in health paranoia is not because of COVID. For some reason, I’m not worried for it, and neither is the worst I have experienced for it nearly as major as it should be with someone who has a huge health anxiety. Weird, I know.

when i was a pre-teen i experienced what i call a minor sexual abuse experience form my step father. a person who i have had a great relationship since forever so this was a confusing experience for me.

i spoke with my mother about this at the time yet my father denied everything. my mom wanted to go to the police and i refused, i didn’t find it necessary, i wanted to resolve this as a family and move on.

my father then stopped speaking to me for months and when he decided to, his first words were “you nearly broke up our marriage”. i was shut down. i didn’t understand the need to say this as i wasn’t at fault.

years passed and we never spoke about it again and i guess i had to make out as if everything were fine.

christmas 2018 i brought it up again, and again i was 
denied everything but was also receiving apologies.

i left my family home to come back to my home, my parents then were not speaking to me for a while, as i ruined christmas. 

i then received an email from a lawyer a few weeks after, saying that i should never speak about the issue  again as it was false information. i couldn’t believe my parent went to a lawyer (by recommendation of a friend of theirs, which is dumb, digging their own grave because what if this person was to speak around town...?).

once again i didn’t understand why they couldn’t resolve this with me. it’s like my mom wanted to take my stepdads side instead of mine, her only child at that matter. someone who i have had a best friend type relationship with, so why did she do that?

a few weeks ago i brought up the issue once again, this time i spoke about why getting a lawyer on their daughter was extremely incorrect and also the way they brought me up, i disagreed with their lack of patience and that i don’t agree with the fact they used to beat me, a lot. i look back and, i behaved pretty much like every child.

i see how many parents act with their kids now, and i see compassion, love, patience and understanding. my parents aren’t bad people but they continued a generational cycle which i intend to stop.

my mom says she doesn’t regret anything and won’t apologise. she is now not speaking to me.

we had a great relationship amidst all this crap, what i don’t understand is when i’ve done wrong i have learned, apologised and grown yet when i have called them out it turns into an argument and lack of accountability.

not sure what to do at this point and if it wrong also.",19Sep2020,1

182,"Hey! So i don't know if this is the right place to discuss this, but i don't really know where to go.

Little about me, i am a 15 year old gay girl and closeted for obvious reasons.

So I keep having this weird urge to see someone's SO get hurt and then saved by her lover, obviously this happens only with wlw couples. For example in Supergirl where Alex was kidnapped and Maggie was trying to save her this whole time. I watched this episode a couple times just because i wanted this hurt/comfort genre and I always seek it when I start some new series with a WLW couple in it. I don't know what it is and apparently it's not normal, since my friends don't seem to have it, (found out about it just a couple of days ago and it's bugging me ever since). I just want something to happen to someone's girlfriend and then be saved or something like that. I have been trying to research this myself, but I can't seem to find anything except that it actually exists as a genre in fanfiction lmao.

 I know it's weird, I just want to understand why do i have this in the first place, thank you for any help you can give me.",19Sep2020,1

I’m having mental breakdowns in pubic places because I’m unable to drive when I start freaking out so I pull over and getting the cops called on me. I can’t focus on anything, I went to make photocopies and driving past homeless people knowing I have selective empathy like everyone else made me hate myself so much I was crying in my car getting as high as possible so I could walk inside and look some random person in the eyes so I can make these stupid fucking photo copies.",19Sep2020,1
185,"I’ve been disassociating a lot recently (nothing feels real, hours seem like minutes, I feel separate from everything, etc.) likely due to the stress of being alive in 2020 on top of regular life things. Now, with RGB dying and the idea of having to go through yet another brutal senate confirmation (trying not to think about beyond that), stress has pretty much shut me down. I’m having a difficult time feeling anything other than numb even though I’m mentally still just this side of optimistic. 

Does anyone have advice on how to stop disassociating? Or advice on how to acknowledge and feel my feelings in a healthy way?",19Sep2020,1
186,"My psychiatrist suspects bipolar disorder and wants me to give these newer generation BP medications a shot. Luckily my insurance covers them. I didn't have much luck with Seroquel (worked but way too much weight gain-that I still have to lose now). Respiradal or Abilify \*can't remember which I tried but they made me feel super jittery and uncomfortable, hard to explain.

For 15 years I've really struggled with severe severe severe generalized ANXIETY and OCPD, with bouts of depression. Now all of a sudden because I'm 30 and my mental health has kind screwed up my life, depression has REALLY been a kicker.... so now magically all of a sudden I might have Bipolar Disorder lol \*\*I swear I believe all these docs do is ""guess and check"" method....

187,"I’m a 29 year old guy I’ve always been more of an introvert. I work 40 hours a week at work and without revealing to many private details a function of my job is communicating with people over the phone, so when the weekend rolls around to me it’s a chance to mentally recharge, mow my lawn, go grocery shopping or do laundry, clean my house, clean my car every so often. Basically what I’m getting at is a lot of these activities are ones I do solo. I was going to the gym once a week but I kinda stopped back in March due to covid but I might reconsider going back to put myself back in a positive social environment. 

I honest to god don’t have any friends. I communicate with people at work, mostly in regard to work related matters and sometimes I’ll say something funny or vent about something. I kinda realized that when someone asked me what my plans were for the weekend, I said “oh not much” and just kinda fake laughed. I’ve never dated but I’ve been successful in other aspects of my life. I kinda grew up poor and put myself through college, I worked hard saved a lot lived frugal I m a home owner I own my car part of my self pride comes to the tune of my financial success that I started with nothing and I build a strong foundation for myself. I’m financially secure basically which gives me so much pride and peace of mind.

The only thing I just never really mastered in life is the socializing thing. I’ve had friends before obviously just not in a while. In the past I’ve had acquaintances coworkers who i was friendly with and joked around with. The last time I had a friend in the traditional sense I guess was back in high school. But to be fair I didn’t really make an active effort to attach myself to people once I began college I did in high school but I did maybe once or twice or so try to attach to someone but it kinda just became the norm for me to be on my own to do things my way and so on. 

I don’t know if I’m upset or anything I’m just reflecting and kinda asking myself if I should put myself out there and maybe make a connection or 2? I guess I’m just kinda craving some new stimuli in my life like every week feels like a repeat over and over it’s fun to make more money save more get a little richer but I just feel like I’m lacking a certain something ya know

I don’t know maybe friendship companionship I mean I do value my alone time I just wish there could be some more exciting elements in my life I guess. Even as I post this I kinda have an idea about what you’ll reply you’ll say join a club, approach someone at your gym or somewhere else, or something to that effect. I just don’t want to randomly latch onto some random person I could only be attached to a person if there is some motivator. Maybe my thinking is flawed or I’m overthinking I don’t know.

190,"I don't know what's going on with me. I've been suffering from depression my whole life and it's been horrible lately. I've came really close to ending it this month. Usually being around my friends provides some temporary relief from my depression, but lately it seems to make it worse. I'll be hanging out with people, and regardless if I was already feeling down or not, my mood just plummets. I can't connect or relate to the people around me, their laughter makes me tense up like I'm in pain. I'll try to stay in the room and just play on my phone (something that usually helps calm my social anxiety), but it provides no relief, and I just grow more and more restless and frustrated with my negative feelings. I seek escape, to another room, or sometimes I even go out to my car, and usually I break down crying immediately, and start feeling extremely suicidal.

This has been happening almost on a weekly basis. I just want to hang out with my friends but I can't stop being depressed, even for a moment. I spend all my time sleeping and crying.",19Sep2020,1

192,"When I tell people that I consider myself an angry person, they usually don't believe me because I typically don't come across as one. This is because I tend to keep my anger bottled in, suppressing the emotions I feel. The issue with this is that just because you suppress your emotions does not mean that they go away. You still have to deal with them on your own. Because of this I have had to teach myself some ways to deal with my pent up anger, and I would like to share some with you beautiful people.

1. Stop being judgemental/cynical of others and start looking for the good in people.

2. Understand that most of the time, other people aren’t trying to piss you off. They just don’t realize that what they’re doing is pissing you off. 

3. Remind yourself that you won’t solve any problems by getting angry.

4. Remember that you yourself are not perfect. So don’t expect others to be perfect either.

Keeping these four things in mind has been crucial for me in dealing with my anger. I still got a long way to go, but I’m definitely headed in the right direction.

I go more into detail about all of this in my latest youtube video. Check it out here: https://youtu.be/NP90dZyVnKc",19Sep2020,1
194,"I feel quite alone in how I've been feeling. I have had a rough couple of years now. A couple of years ago, when I turned 20, a lot of things changed. I had my first panic attack and triggered a panic disorder. That made me stay home and become more anti-social. I gained a lot of weight. My skin broke out. And with that- my confidence was gone. I became more bitter. Paranoid. In the beginning, I was so mad that this happened to me, while all my friends were out living their lives and had no way of understanding what I went through. They still looked good. They were able to do whatever they wanted. I was so angry that I was in my 20s and I felt like I was trapped from being able to enjoy my life. Not to be dramatic, but I literally felt like I was in a one-way mirror, and I was screaming to get out but no one could see me. I was so angry that in a matter of seconds my life changed and within months so did myself. 

*I am the worst version of myself and I have been trying to get the old me back ever since.* 

I used to be a girl that was known to be outgoing, optimistic, and I felt pretty good about myself (meaning I didn't *hate* my appearance, I had the confidence because I had clear skin, I was somewhat fit, etc) And now I am unrecognizable in every way. One positive is I did get my panic attacks under control, which wow, I really thought was the end of my life at the time. (I got them under control due to antidepressants, specifically Lexapro, and got off of it after 1 year) I am definitely grateful every single day of my life that, at least right now, it is gone! But- I have been FIGHTING to be happier again. And it took me a while to realize that one of the ways that would help me be happier is to clear my skin, lose weight, and go out more. It is just who I am as a person, I need these things to feel good. Unfortunately, no matter how hard I have tried, nothing has worked. I am still fighting 2 years later to ""look good"" for myself, and I am not one to give up. But strangely, I feel like I have been battling myself. 

Some days, I am really good at letting go and I try to be grateful for what I do have. I try to tell myself if I am consistent, things will turn around. I will feel good about myself again, which will then make me want to go out more, talk to people, find a boyfriend, make a career for myself, etc. My biggest motivator is to do this for my parents... because they've seen me at my worst for too long now. But then the other part of me self destructs (I get in a down mood and tell myself to give up). After a month, I ALWAYS give up. I overeat again, I stop doing my skincare routine, I stop seeing friends, etc. I don't take care of myself and then I go into a dark place and stay in my room and become very depressed. I become very snappy. I get mad at myself very easily. Even writing this, it is so weird to realize who I have become as a person. 

I have been crying every other day randomly. I cry when I listen to a happy song in the car. I cry when I'm about to go out with my friends. I cry sometimes out of nowhere when I am doing absolutely nothing. I feel crazy. I miss the days where I felt SO happy! I feel stuck. I am not sure how to keep going, but I know that if I find a way to past the one month mark, things can only go up. 

I know some people are going to say that the things I want will not make me happier, but I disagree. I think a big part of happiness is being comfortable with yourself and liking yourself. I tried to let go of this desire for my ""old self"" and just accept the way I look now. And that life is different now. But then I am left with... deep sadness. I can't help the way I feel, ya know? 

 **So, what is the point of this post? Well... I was wondering if anyone out there relates to this.** 

**What is your advice?** 

**What are the ways to change my mindset and not ""self destruct"" and ruin my progress?**

**Why am I crying randomly?**

195,"Today my mother told me that she's been very unhappy with my father lately. He doesn't ask her simple things like how's your day and how are you feeling and he generally always talks to her when it's related to work or if he needs something. On top of it all, he forgot their anniversary and this really upset her. I can see that she is very hurt and she is the type of person who keeps it all in unless she's pushed over the edge. I told her that it would be best if they said down and talked about it as my father seems to think that everything is fine. All this came as a shock to me because my parents have always seemed perfectly happy. I keep thinking that I might be responsible for this situation even though I'm probably not. I've also been very depressed lately and today it feels like I lost a big part of what I thought was stability. Any advice on how to help them work this out would be appreciated.

197,"Some background:
My mom is bipolar 2, diagnosed at age 43.
My dad was diagnosed with depression by his primary care physician, but has a lot of unaddressed issues and is very manipulative.

I started going to therapy through my school (I’m 21) about 3 weeks ago. I went twice with my universities social worker, and about 15 minutes into my second meeting she was asking if I wanted anti-depressants.

I was a little taken back, because I told her my mom was bipolar and told her about the symptoms I have that my mom told me she had when she was younger (mind racing, panic attacks, getting over attached/reliant on friends, eating disorder that comes and goes, being able to stare at the wall for hours in my own head, crying hysterically for hours then being able to pull it together to go out with friends and be genuinely happy while out), and she didn’t ask me any follow up questions about it.

Hell, I even moved out of my grandma's house, which I thought was the reason why I was so sad all the time, but I'm still just as sad as I was before. Probably even more sad. I've heard antidepressants work, but I'm already taking medication for epilepsy and am really scared about possible side effects. I've heard they cause anything from weight gain (which would make me more sad obviously) to anxiety (which in my opinion defeats the purpose of even taking an antidepressant to begin with but whatever) to even an early death (?) so I don't take them.

The whole thing ended with my brother getting a panic attack for the first time and i cant stop but think that i have got some serious shit issues with my head.  What should i do?

My illness got worse, drug use got worse, life in general started to fray. I came to the conclusion that she would have a better life without me, a happier life.

206,"Before I begin let me say the title sounds mean, but hear me out.

I try my best to view everything from an evolutionary standpoint, for example a foot fetish, or any other strange fetish, can usually be explained through our primal urges. However, homosexuality and gender dysphoria from an evolutionary view, is a drawback. (Less reproduction stalls a species expansion)

Now this isn’t a bad thing, let me clarify that being gay or transgender is in no way a bad thing, it is who you are and you have every right to pursue happiness. But I’m always trying to find new ways to explain to people (especially the hard right) what exactly homosexuality is. 

The way I explain it is: View homosexuality and gender dysphoria as a mental illness if you’re unable to accept it, but not in a degrading way. Such as an amputee or someone with autism, these are members of our society, and just because they function differently doesn’t mean they are lesser. Many people automatically jump to “how do we cure it then” to which my reply is, there already is a cure. It’s called embracing your sexuality. A man who lives his life in the closet will most definitely have more self destructive tendencies, whether it be drinking or isolating himself. If you live your life putting on an act you will lose touch with yourself, the only way for someone who is gay to be satisfied, is for them to be openly gay. 

To summarize all of this, from an evolutionary standpoint homosexuals and trans people are an evolutionary drawback, however this isn’t a bad thing, and the only way for these people to be happy, is to be supported throughout their struggles. It isn’t easy being gay, personally I’m not, but I couldn’t imagine hiding who I am. It would drive me mad. I’d rather have a society of lgbt members than a society filled with repressed desires. 

Next time you’re in an argument over lgbt rights, just explain that forcing people to suppress themselves can lead to far worse things than being gay.",19Sep2020,1

208,"Day 19 of **Suicide Prevention Month** and in today’s post, it will be rather simple and straight to the point. Instead of listening you facts, causes or information on how to deal with Mental Health illness, I will ask one question that many of you haven’t heard in a while. 

**How are you today?**

It may be the simplest of question to ask a person, but unfortunately, it’s not asked enough. 

But, saying that, there are also **MANY** other ways to start a conversation with a stranger. By conversing with a stranger, it will make them feel worthwhile, feel important and that they belong here. You may not know, but the conversation you’ll have with that specific person could be the first conversation that person has had in weeks or even months. How do you know a person is going through a lot? Can you tell when a person is upset or on verge of being in tears? No. Be kind to everyone. Smile at people who deserve it. 

Here are some others way you can start a conversation with a stranger:
- What are the top 5 things in your bucket list?
- Who inspires you everyday? 
- What makes you laugh/smile?
- What’s your idea of a perfect day/night?
- What’s your favourite film/book/TV Show?

Starting a conversation can go a long way. For some, it will make their day, for others, they have made a brand new friend for life. 

If you, like myself, hear “how are you?” a hundred times a week and you’re in need of finding a different way of asking it, don’t look any further. Below, I will list MORE ways of asking a person how they truly are without saying those exact words! 

- How long has it been?!
- Anything interesting happening in your life recently?
- What’s new with you?
- Travelled or been anywhere fun lately? 
- How is life sailing?
- How have you been the last time we spoke? 
- What’s been the highlight of your day/year so far?
- What’s the latest buzz in your world?

212,"I’m an established patient (with this therapist), I’ve been seeing him for over a year. From what I could gather from our interactions (as an Autistic adult, so grain of salt there) we had an okay relationship.

A couple of months ago, I phoned him. He did not phone me back. I waited a month—nothing. So I phoned him again. The receptionist said he was busy, said she’d knock on his door. Nothing. I phoned again—he wasn’t in. Phoned when he was back, left a message on his machine—I tried to be calm and work with the system, hoping it’d help. Nothing.

I suspect that I have cPTSD, and I’ve realized on my own that I’ve been spending most of my days dissociated. I’m very isolated, and my support system is not reliable anymore. I’m trying to stay present, to be mindful and deal on my own, but I’m having limited success. Just being awake is a reason to dissociate. I’m struggling to care for myself through body pain and what looks to be a sinus infection (but “passed” the province’s COVID checklist).

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do in this situation. I’m a textbook example of learned helplessness, and while I’ve found a hotline in my province (Alberta, Canada) that could potentially help connect me to other services, I don’t know if that’s what I should be doing... and I don’t know where to find out. Google searching did not help, and asking my caregiver will likely end with them lashing out at or dismissing me, which isn’t good for my living situation.

It is quite a problem because I’m going to be going to college on my own which ends at 5pm, it’s nearly winter which means it’s going to be getting darker much quicker which makes me even more anxious. I don’t think I’m much of a “target”? But still my mind makes up the worst possible scenario all the time.",19Sep2020,1
216,"When it comes down to it, life is a bunch of distractions to a terrible society that we’re trapped in. People are awful to one another. Humans are terribly selfish, as shown through the pandemic. We live in a society with a horrible economy. There’s literally almost nothing good about life. There is no future for people my age until the old get sick and die (M21). We distract ourselves from our terrible situations to find temporary relief. We work 8 hours a day, five days a week, with weekends off.

There is no afterlife to me. This is it. There was nothing before birth, there will be nothing after, and shits going to continue to decline. Why do people keep going, I don’t understand it. I can’t get mental help because my family judges it hard and will just find me lazy and tell me to do more. I hate this life I’ve been given, but I’d never personally take it away from me. I’m just stuck. Everyone’s in the same cycle, I just feel like the only one who can see life for what it is in it’s truest form.

218,"I was texting my friend at about 10:00 at night and we were talking about our friendship. I like her and she knows that and doesn't like me that way. I'm very self conscious about the way i text, and a lot of the time i feel like i'm being very mean to someone but they actually don't mind. Pretty much, I was trying to talk about some issue i had and then i realized that for the past few minutes i hadn't been able think straight, like there was a million thoughts going on in my head all at once and i couldn't process any of them. I had to end the conversation like this:

i'm being dumb and asking you to do a lot of things that you're not comfortable with and,

Please excuse me, i need some space. I'll text you tomorrow.

The whole time my hands were shaking and i was barely able to get that last part out. I talked to a friend about it the day after and she said it might be a panic attack.

219,"[M24] I can't feel strong emotions anymore, nothing is special. Yesterday, I went to this very scenic park with a girl I've been dating that overlooked the city and it was beautiful. I knew logically the magic of the imagine and moment before me, but inside I felt nothing; when I was 16 I would have killed to be in a place like this with a girl. I can only seem to feel good emotions for split seconds in rare occasions, most of the time I feel like life is horrible and I'm sad/mad all the time... The wonder, love, and lust I had as a teenager is gone. I can't even have sex because instead of being in the moment I'm constantly thinking about how I'm gonna fuck up.

I don't know what to do; psychiatrist don't help, never have. I'm currently in trades school to become an Electrician and I have a path forward ( not suicidal ) I jist wish I felt young! I'm 24 not 90... 

I also have alot of beliefs around women that lower my self imagine and I'm terrified to talk about my emotions to other people because the reaction is always either to brush me off or the typical ""you're a man; be one"" speech.

220,"I feel mentally handicapped. I'm not diagnosed with anything, but I absolutely hate how my brain works. 

I read something - My brain decides not to process the words. I have to go back and read again to understand. This happens frequently, like every paragraph. 

Im listening to a podcast- they say words, which I hear perfectly fine, yet my brain goes ""im gonna ignore that"", so I have to fucking go back and replay. 

Because there's no such thing as a replay button in real life conversations, I'm constantly forgetting what the person in front of me has said. Even when they're on the same sentence, Ive already forgotten what they said at the start of the sentence, so as I'm trying to remember, I ignore what they're saying at the present. 

For me, I feel like this only when I'm stressed out. But the scary thing for me is, am I causing permanent damage to my brain from being so stressed out? Is it possible to fix a damaged brain? That genuinely terrifies me - the horror of suffering irreversible damage to the brain.

I was bullied and harassed constantly for years in my early teens. All my confidence drained out of me. I could barely speak in groups. I believe I missed out on years of brain development because I spent most of my lunch breaks at school in the fucking bathroom stalls.

I feel like a zombie. When I speak, I speak slowly because for even the words I say, I'm thinking ""am I saying this right?"" 

Im obsessed with using the right grammar, so I'm always fighting with myself on the correct word usage in spontaneous conversations that I cant concentrate on the essence of the conversation. 

An example for me is 'have not' vs 'did not'. I waste fucking brain energy from debating which one to use. Even though I'm a native speaker of English, I feel like English is foreign to me sometimes. I cant wrap my head around things I hear everyday, and that sucks. Especially when theyre fast at talking.",19Sep2020,1

I do cry a lot when I'm anxious and stressed, so I escaped the situation and hid in the bathroom then started crying hysterically.

226,"This year my job has been highly demanding and more stressful than normal due to Covid. It has meant teaching online, and working much longer days just to get through. Some nights, I was so caught up in working that I’d keep working until I realised that it was morning and I was due in class in an hour. It’s been exhausting and meant that I only had energy for work and nothing else. 

Holidays started two days ago. I’ve spent all of the time since in bed, not wanting to move or do anything. I ordered food as delivery because I couldn’t be bothered cooking, yet I feel like I should be working.  I have work to do still and keep checking it and forcing myself to close it instead of doing it immediately. 

The only reason I’ve got out of bed is to feed the cat, get food from the door and go to the bathroom. 

This is a pretty typical behavioural pattern for me and has been for years. I’m stressed with high anxiety levels and go go go, or I can’t do anything and have no energy. Having no energy will last for weeks or months without stress and purpose to get started again.

227,"Looking after your wellbeing is the most important thing that you can do to make the world a more peaceful place - when you're stressed you have more difficult interactions with others, they impact others and so on. So how do you prioritise your mental health? Through the choices you make in every moment, and these can be big, life-changing decisions and the little decisions we face in every moment. 

For example when considering a new job, we might look at it and say that it’s stressful and long hours, but a good step in our career and will lead to us being happy - at some point. But another option could allow us to enjoy our career and won’t take us away from the things that are good for our mental health like our family, friends and mindful activities. By making our peace the top criterion in our big and little decisions, we can lead more peaceful and happier lives.

Now I wanted to stop smoking which is no problem per sé but my neighbours are a couple that separated about 2 months ago but are now together again. They fight a lot which triggered my anxiety since I had a toxic relationship before which sounded pretty much like their fights do. I go out everytime I hear them but I just get so shaken that I need SOMETHING, be it a cig or selfharm. I dont need to smoke any other time of the day, only when I get triggered by them.

And the other weird thing is something that I do sometimes involuntary still today, when I'm looking something that makes me feel excited or is something ""satisfying"" (even seeing a bathtub fill with water) I feel the necessity of rub my hands with force and fast, like I need to release that excitement in a physical way, but I only do it when I'm alone, when I'm with people if the sensations is strong, I close my mouth hard trying to release that excitement, when I was 14 or so someone saw me and told me that it was weird, and I got totally ashamed, I didn't want to be watched, so I started doing it discreetly even totally alone, rubbing the hands slower and with more force, making me get some kind of skin damage when I was 15-16, then and now I began to quit doing it but it shows up sometimes.

235,"Hi everyone! First of all I'd like to recognise that it has been a hard 2020 all round, and I'm sure I'm not the only one struggling at the moment.

Basically I am a 29 yo male, and in January my long term partner who I lived with broke up with me (on my birthday) and asked me to move out immediately (it was her house). I have felt kind of like I've been drifting ever since, both physically and mentally. 

After the breakup I had a very short time to find somewhere to move to and so moved in to on older woman's house as a lodger on a temporary basis. This was okay to begin with, we each had our own routine and didn't see each other all that much and were civil to one another. In February/March I was spending a lot of evenings going to social events, and exercising to keep my mind occupied. I started a business at the end of last year which was going well at this point. I also started going to therapy in these months, and found a therapist who I actually got along with (after trying several in my life time).

When the pandemic came in mid March, I lost my main client for my business, the social groups I had joined were no longer doing events, and my therapist went to work in a COVID hospital and could no longer see me. I ended up being at home in lockdown all the time with my landlady, and I found her difficult to spend time with. I am very introverted and I felt like she would talk to me a lot about all of her worries and just want me to listen, and while I was okay to do this initially I felt like it drained me and I didn't get much out of it - we also had contrasting opinions on most things but I didn't want to offend her as I was her lodger. Because of this and also financial worries, I moved back in with my parents in the countryside in April.

I have been here for 5 months now, and had little social interaction with anyone other than my parents, the occasional phone call with a friend, and online chat with co-workers once a week or so. I am just grateful that although my business had a rough few months and I was not able to get any financial support from the government, I am able to run it remotely from anywhere with an internet connection, and it is now a success once again.

I feel like throughout the 5 months I have felt progressively more distant with more and more negative thoughts. I meditate daily and so tend to notice patterns in my moods and mental health. I the issues I was discussing earlier in the year with my therapist have been going around in my head a lot, and I am gaining a more and more negative perspective on them. There are 2 main issues:

1 - Asperger syndrome

The first issue is around me potentially having Asperger syndrome. One of the reason's my ex-partner broke up with me was because she believe I could not give her adequate emotional support, and she suggested to me (and our relationship therapist) that I may have Asperger syndrome. I am in the process of getting a diagnosis (the waiting list for seeing someone about this on the NHS is around 1 - 1.5 years currently), and have done online tests which suggest that I potentially do have Asperger syndrome.

I really struggle with the idea of this, it basically means that my brain works differently to most people's brain. I'm very good at logic and at solving problems, my brain works primarily via these mechanisms. I can get very attached to my own routines and systems, and need a lot of alone time to process in retrospect each event in my life and emotion that I feel. I get intensely anxious about things that other people don't (being the centre of attention, attending social events, driving, being in even a minor leadership position). I struggle to feel like I am 'on the inside of life' with other people and to empathise with them in 'real time', usually feeling like I am watching life go by as an observer (one of my favourite books is Perks of Being a Wallflower).

However, I do care about the emotions of others, and want to be able to connect with people and give support to those close to me. I feel bad that I have not even had the self awareness to notice my problem until recently, when I have started to look more closely. I'm nearly 30 years old and I have just 1 reasonably close friend (I see him every few months and we talk on the phone every few weeks), my ex girlfriend broke up with me because I was too emotionally distant, I have lost touch with everybody I knew from school and university, and other friends/acquaintances almost never message me casually - usually I have to be the one to instigate online conversations etc... and these often go nowhere. I'm not sure what my ex meant by emotionally distant, but I think it has to do with the fact that I would sit and listen to her issues but would not respond in an animated way, or always understand and process what she was feeling until hours/days later. 

Her expectations of me were that she could share her emotions with me at any time she liked, and she expected me to listen and to process them right away - this made me feel la lot of pressure, and also tired me out emotionally, leaving me with no remaining energy to spend on social/emotional interactions with family/friends. It made me wonder how on earth people who require a partner to give them this kind of daily emotional attention like this even manage when they are single? Anyway, after talking to others it seems her expectations were reasonable and that many/most people will have similar expectations in a relationship - but I just don't ever see myself being able to fulfil them! My own way of dealing with emotions is to process them internally and reflect upon them a lot, and then talk to someone close to me if I discover a tough issue that I can't resolve, but this is more of a 'once every now and again' requirement. Also, I see the need to talk to someone about my emotions as something that I am happy to do whenever the other person is ready, rather than something I must  force on someone whenever I feel the emotions come (which I have also been told is unusual).

2 - sexuality/gender

I have been thinking a lot about my sexuality and gender lately, I don't feel like I fit neatly into a box and this makes me uncomfortable. I never used to feel like I had to, and that everyone had a different  sexuality and that couples just made things work through compromise and exploration. However, lack of sexual compatibility (or of even being vaguely on the same page) in previous relationships has made me feel insecure - as if to get that sexual compatibility I need to fit neatly into a box and then search specifically for someone else who fits neatly into that box. 

Without going into too much detail - I am mostly straight, consider myself to be mainly aroused by BDSM activities, primarily as a masochist. I often fantasise about being dominated by a woman, or occasionally by a man or a couple. I also fantasise a lot about myself (lightly) dominating a woman, and cuckolding scenarios. To be honest I don't enjoy penetrative sex all that much, it certainly isn't the pinnacle of emotional connection for me, which I have been told it is for many. I much prefer touching/oral sex/teasing/imaginative sexual games, and the thing which makes me feel intensely emotional (in fantasy, haven't done it much IRL) is power exchange.

Next, I think I am probably monogamish. I consider 'loyalty' to mean being honest, transparent and emotionally committed to a partner, not necessarily complete monogamy. Until experiencing it first hand, I did not consider that many (most?) people have tight definitions of monogamy which are violated by many things other than just sleeping with someone else, including: me telling them I fantasise about other people, bisexuality (the thought that there is a part of my sexuality that they cannot fulfil and hence I am not enough for them), a threesome, not acting possessive if they show attraction to/fantasise about another.

I don't really relate to my gender, I'm fine with presenting as male to the general public just for simplicity, and I don't have gender dysphoria. I'm fine with having a man's body and sex organs, but would be equally happy with a woman's body (from an identity perspective - I am aware that having a woman's body is more hassle in our society). However, when I get close enough with someone to be sexual with them, I don't really enjoy them always talking to me as if I am some masculine guy, complimenting masculine features of my body etc.. it doesn't feel good. I don't want to feel like someone is turned on by me as a man, but as a person. I want them to know and accept me as a person, and not focus on me being male too often - perhaps sometimes, but to also allow me feel more 'female' sometimes too. 

I have found from multiple past relationships that there is a kind of default (in a straight relationship) that the man and woman both assume each other to be monogamous, straight and relatively vanilla. I have only had 3 serious relationships, so not sure if this is always the case but the conclusion so far is that I am yet again the freak/anomaly.

But anyway, I have been processing these 2 issues for months now, and feeling more and more hopeless about future relationships and friendships. I think writing them out and sharing them on here will help to get things off my chest a bit.",19Sep2020,1

I am not scared as much of ""living"" as much as i am of losing the people i care about, specifically my dad. I lost my mom 4 years ago to cancer and i cant fathom that one day my dad will be gone as well. 

Also, i think i would find it weird and uncomfortable not living with him when i move out. I have a gf and we will probably move out to live together as soon as we can, but the fact that my dad wont be around the corner in another room a few years down the line is making me bawl my eyes out.

mental illnesses: so things like anxiety, depression, and bulimia and thinks i know i have but can't get diagnosed until i'm 16 because i don't want my parents knowing 

parents: so my friend never really believes me when i talk about my parents but they always just act like good parents when other people are around but without company they turn into complete hell hole to hate me because i'm a girl and they wanted a boy like my brother 

TW⚠️other things: my mind constantly things about self-harm and suicide and then i've already planned that i'm going to die before 60 

school: literally gives me a panic attack every day

weight: basically my mind is telling me to get thinner

bestie: Still not completely sure how much i know about her,  i realised i might have asthma because i've got the symptoms and my mum and brother have it and that annoys me, yeah the asthma thing was important because i have panic attacks about how she might think i'm trying to copy her but i'm not

life: i've had a total of about 7 panic attacks just about the thought that my bestie might move further away if her mum gets a job somewhere that's....idk....not here?

251,"r/mentalhealth has posted some amazing content on mental health and opened my eyes to many issues I did not previously know.

But one thing that stands out more than any data point, any guideline, is perception, which may be the most important thing in healthcare: [https://www.sehealthcarequalityconsulting.com/2019/04/16/perception-equals-reality/](https://www.sehealthcarequalityconsulting.com/2019/04/16/perception-equals-reality/)

While we know COVID-19 has led to an increase in mental health and more overdoses, we still continue to face the same biases at an individual level. We as patients are not treated individually based on the clinical studies that discuss healthcare inequities broadly.

The reason for this discrepancy is the perception difference between individual patient care and broad healthcare policy.

I am working on a fundraiser that will sell hoodies and use the proceeds to educate hospitals on clinical best practices for patients with mental health conditions and substance dependencies, and we will supply critical medications like Naloxone that are often in short supply.

The most important thing to remember is that healthcare is not statistics, broad generalizations, or large scale studies. It is individual conversations, narratives, patient journeys.

Why do you think healthcare has such difficulty applying broad principles and policies to individual patients? 

And why do you think patients will mental health are disproportionately affected more than any other population?",19Sep2020,1

I also can’t really talk about my feelings to anyone ik since I’m pretty bad at expressing my feelings and my acquaintances won’t understand/see it as smth small or even stupid (has happened already).
I’ve been trying to find people online to be friends with, but it hasn’t worked since the conversations last one day, and I have no social skills in real life and am very shy.

-would i be able to groom myself? as a girl this is really important to me and if i’m not able to it usually drives my anxiety through the roof. i get that i most likely won’t be able to bring razors with me, but what about waxing strips?

258,"I don't know if this is because of the pandemic or not but over the past few months it feels that I've been thinking more pessimistically. I have always had anxiety. I worry a lot about upcoming events and I often dread social outings even if it's with my friends. I worry even about things that are so minor that I wouldn't even want to mention them to other people because it would sound silly. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, recently my mother has been talking to me about  my college apps as I am a senior in high school. I dread college from the bottom of my heart. I couldn't conceptualize a single future where I would enjoy myself there. I don't necessarily struggle academically but I guess you could say I really don't like change. I am not social either so if I lose touch with my few friends then I see myself becoming incredibly lonely. My two older siblings are in college and both of them have often expressed how I should cherish my time in high school because college isn't enjoyable.

259,"I have a really bad habit at my school of not looking when crossing the streets because obviously pedestrians have the right away and people have to stop cuz yaknow it's a school campus.

But obviously some people speed, don't care, aren't looking etc etc

Again, bad habit of me testing people, being an asshole, and just a suicidal person...I don't really look all that often when crossing. I do when I'm not doing it on a crosswalk, and I'll do a quick left right glance like if I see a car speeding I'm not going to walk out, but if I see a car that I know has enough room to slow down, I'm going, lol.

ANYWAY, today there was a car that was way far back, and I wasn't at the crosswalk yet but I  was getting there and very obviously walking towards it to cross, I knew they had enough time to stop so I just kept walking but they weren't and I had to stop and they drove right in front of me.

264,"I have been diagnosed as depressed, anxious, socially anxious and a bunch of other stuff too over the years but I really think I have some kind of personality disorder. Probably covert/vulnerable narcissism or borderline or dependent, or at least strong traits of those, either in addition to or instead of my other doagnoses. I have other symptoms but the one that is most telling to me and that I will focus on here is my obsession with being a victim. It's sick and I hate it but it's so true. I can't seem to shake it. I crave sympathy so much. It's all about how others see me. I can't stand to be seen as selfish or bad but it's all about my ego not about being a good person and ironically I am more selfish because of my desire to avoid being seen as selfish. I use my mental instability and depression as a tool to protect my ego. It's part of the story I tell myself, even if I really am depressed, the reason I can't get better is that if I get better I have to acknowledge and take responsibility for myself. Well I have to do that anyway but... I thought I would grow out of this shit but I haven’t. I feel developmentally arrested and absolutely pathetic to be honest. At least in this respect. I mean, imagine it, I'm that person that WANTS to be pitied. How sick and disgusting is that? How offensive to those that are actually suffering and hiding it?

Most people I talk to who have serious struggles with mental health, abuse, trauma etc. say they try hard to hide their problems and appear to have the perfect life, that they actively dislike sympathy, pity, attention etc. Some people have even gone so far as to suggest that people with real issues typically don’t want sympathy while people who are “faking” or have less serious issues are the ones that talk about them the most.

While I am also very aware of how I come across to others, and try very hard to avoid falling into self-pity, oversharing etc. I very much crave to be “seen” and to share my pain and receive sympathy and even pity. It disgusts that I am like this. It seems very adolescent. Some people, particularly authority figures and bosses, trigger some deep desire in me to be seen and validated and even for them to feel sorry for me.

Here is another related thing: it is painful for me to be reminded that “everyone has their own struggles.” I know that is true, I really know it, and I remind myself of it all the time. But instead of feeling compassion and connection I just feel intense embarrassment and shame and anger, and a strong resistance to that idea, because I don’t want to believe it. It reminds me of all of the people out there who are doing the right thing day in and day out, who are not complaining, who can’t afford to have a mental breakdown, who are making better choices and are at least somewhat thriving (at least outwardly) and trying to be happy. It reminds me that they have issues too they are just dealing with the pain inwardly while I am here feeing sorry for myself and imagining that I am especially troubled and have it especially hard. Even now I still sort of believe that even though statistically speaking it’s unlikely.

It’s weird because I feel like when people say this to me, or on the Internet, they are not trying to be dismissive. I think I’m supposed to be comforted by the fact that my struggles are not unique. But instead I find it intensely painful because it implies that I’m overly sensitive, entitled, and lacking in character and maturity. It takes away all possible excuses for any of my behavior or the fact that I’m not where I wanted to be in life. It forces me to face the reality that I’m not special and that even though I’m in so much psychic pain so is everyone else (why is that so hard to accept?)

If I acknowledge reality I also have to a knowledge some extremely unsettling things about myself and my entitlement. I guess it also forces me to accept that having intense feelings is just a part of life, and because you don’t have it worse than other people, that means it’s probably not going to get that much better. So part of it is just going to be accepting that I’m always going to feel things and that there is a lot of pain in life and that’s normal. And that I can’t really complain about it.

I don’t know if any of this is making sense. I’m crying a lot as I write this. It really bothers me and I feel so ashamed and kind of disgusted with myself. It makes it hard to change because my defenses that hurt me are also what are keeping me from seeing the truth about myself, and so protecting my ego.",19Sep2020,1

267,"This feeling is hard to explain but i will give it a try.
All my life i have loved. I automatically like people, and back in my teenage years i used to have a friend that i had a very deep connection with. This ""us against the world""-feeling. I didn't need anyone else and i finally found someone who i could give all my (platonic) love to. It has been ten years now and i haven't had any friendships/relationships on that level. It's like all this love is build up inside me and it's awful not being able to share it. I have friends and i have had lovers but...i don't want to sound ignorant but i feel like nobody ever understood the depths that my love goes too and nobody was ever able to love me on the same level. And this doesn't only apply to people. It's anything. Sometimes i see something beautiful, it can be just a scenery, the sky,..and i will find it so beautiful that it is unbearable. I once heard this quote from a movie ""sometimes things are so beautiful that i can't take it anymore"" and that's exactly how i feel every day. It's very contradictive but all this beauty i see and all the love i have, not being able to share it on a deeper level, makes me feel empty and sad inside.

269,"About 3 years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I shrugged it off because I didn't understand the disorder and thought ""surely that's not me"". On top of that, I started feeling better and falsely believed I was fine.

 Last week I fell into a major depressive/anxious state. I'm having panicked thinking basically from the time I wake up to when I am able to sleep. Sometimes I wake up and immediately start crying, or feel numb. I'm having consistent intrusive thoughts of sexual assault that causes physical symptoms like fast heart rate, sweating, anger, and chest pain. 

It's not even my own sexual assault that makes me feel these things, it's any triggers on tv, in conversation, and even scenarios I make in my head. I'm finding anything related to sex as non consensual even when it is. My boyfriend is trying to be there for me but I can't/don't want to tell him about all my trauma. I'm taking things out on him and he doesn't deserve it. 

I finally got on mood stabilizers and a prn that's supposed to help with anxiety. Nothing is helping. I have no will to get out of bed or do anything. I feel like this will go on forever and that's hard to reconcile. 

I can't keep a job longer than 6 months. I have an episode about every 6 months and quit my job. I can't go on like this forever.

I can't afford therapy but I desperately need consistent help. I need to feel like I'm not alone and that I'm not crazy. I guess I don't know what I hope to get from posting this... I guess just knowing that other people are there and might understand what I'm going through could help. 

If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions about ways to cope or any free therapy avenues please let me know.",19Sep2020,1
