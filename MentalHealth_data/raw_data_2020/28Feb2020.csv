0,"okay so this is going to be my throw away to post embarrasing shit and mental health issues i have.

in England

problems i have:

crippling depressed (therapist approved)                                                                                                                                   i hear voices (talked to my therapist about it)                                                                                                           issues with morality and more but it takes too long and formatting Reddit as a new user is a little difficult.

problems they cause:

issue is i feel low all the time, i have suicidal thoughts but ive only tried to go through with it once, i feel like a piece of shit and everyone around me hates me. the voices dont help and its a constant reminder that i have no purpose and that my life is a finite resource. i hate the way i look, the way my body should be even though i KNOW its fine, i hate my personality and the way i think about the world as a whole is quite nihilistic.

this girl i really liked left, it was totally my fault but i feel like she was a bitch about it. we were on speaking terms as she left the hometown here and she was planning on coming back down so instead of a full relationship we just vibed together. i felt alone and texted my ex and we started hanging out again, we cuddled, things were tense but nothing sexual. i decided id tell the girl id like (A) about the girl i hung with (B) as they're friends and its not right to not at least tell her, she replied worriedly but all good. next day we argued because i got into an argument with this bitchy girl about something and i said she was shaped like a lava lamp and girl A found out about it and got in a pissy with me. she then revealed shes been annoyed for a lil due to me texting my ex. my ex (B) apparently told her that i was jealous of her ex, was desperate to get with her and said that i hated girl (A). i told her i wanted to explain what actually happened but she had non of it. thing is she called me manipulative and i noticed that its been a trend, i just dont understand what to think about myself. i dont think im manipulative but truth is i am a chronic liar, im trying my best to remain truthful but this is 100% the truth, i lie for no reason but i can tell the truth if i need to. i noticed i tend to lie if it protects me or if it gets me on the better side of an argument but ive always reasoned with myself that i should put myself on top of those that oppose me. usually they're not opposing me...

i dont fear death, i dont have a problem with bodies, im not obsessed with them but my therapist got worried when i explained that i wanted to be a surgeon due to my interest in the inner workings of the body ( i think to this day that its normal, im an extremely curious person ). my past wasn't kind to me, my mothers side of the family have a history of mental illness, my Nan has PTSD and both my parents and their kids have all had depression at least. my father kind of abused me? i was fairly neglected and grew up in poverty. ive overcome a lot of it when i lived with my mother and stepfather and whilst we are average to slightly poor. they try their best and my biological father attempts to help every now and then. i have trouble with concentration and will ramble for hours (as you can see). im stressed with my GCSEs and i hate everything about them. im not getting great grades in the 3 important subjects but im taking active steps to fix it.

the reason im here instead of with my therapist is because i use the public system CAMHs which is a mental health organisation like the NHS. issue is its majorly underfunded and i had a 6 month waiting time before a few sessions. my last one was in November and i just dont feel like i can continue waiting.

what is wrong with me in your opinion, how can i help myself and should i talk to someone privately about it? im worried. thanks for your time and help peoples. i do appreciate every second you take to write and read about this.

1,"  This anger that simmers below the surface. When something happens, it just boils over. When I express how angry I am, it doesnt go away. There's always this nagging feeling in the pit of my stomach that eats away at me. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with my depression and anxiety or if it's something else,but I'm always so irritable and short tempered. Is there anything that I can do to make it stop? I've tried exercise, journaling,talking,etc. But the anger is always there.",28Feb2020,1

Before I (F,19) start ranting, I would like to say that I have never been officially diagnosed nor have I seen a medical professional about my mental health. 

This is something I have never shared before so I think it will be therapeutic for me. I’m not asking for a diagnosis or anything; I would just like to know if anyone else can relate to my past experience. 

I was a happy child and found life pretty smooth. I made friends easily and did well at school. But once I got to secondary school and especially at the age of 14/15 years old, I found life quite difficult and I think it could all be explained if I or my family had realised that I was really struggling mentally. 
I was very shy and closed off, I found it incredibly difficult to make friends and talk to new people. I hated being the centre of attention and I would always blush/ tear up. I hated school presentations and sports competitions and I would often think of ways of catching a cold so I wouldn’t be able to speak or breaking my arm/fingers so I wouldn’t have to play. I would cry all the time, especially if I was struggling to do something and afraid people would think I was useless. I was paranoid about my health/ safety. For about 6 months, I was nauseous, had stomach cramps and developed a phobia of vomiting in public so I missed a lot of school. My mum thought I had a problem with my gut and I even went to the doctor but my mental health was never brought up. When I was made to go to school, I would be crying on the walk there and cry if anyone asked how I was feeling. I would constantly check information like travel times or deadlines to make sure they were correct. I always thought everyone was judging me and comparing me to my twin sister who I resented (unfortunately) because she was always better at everything. I would always worry about my friends and family, always assume the worst. I would try and mentally prepare for situations like the death of a parent because I thought something bad was going to inevitably happen. To be honest, I didn’t like myself and was comparing myself to my sister constantly. I also felt like I wasn’t in charge of my life and I was being dragged along. It almost felt like I was dissociating sometimes.  I had low self-esteem. I couldn’t wait to leave my town and start a whole new life, become someone else away from everyone I knew.

These habits and thoughts disappeared with time. I think changing schools and finding an amazing group of friends (through my sister) pushed me out of my comfort zone as well as tough love from my family who were tired of my ‘sensitivity’. 
I am grateful to no longer feel that way but I do resent my parents, especially my mother for not recognising that I was deeply troubled. I thought it was just my personality and I forgot how I was as a teenager. I thought it was just a phase of awkward teenage years, my hormones were making me sensitive and I was just boring. I’m only seeing this from a new perspective as mental health has become a bigger part of my life and I feel more educated about it. Two people very close to me are struggling and I have had to learn how to be as supportive as I can.  But it also has made me recognise that maybe I was struggling to. My mental health was not taken seriously and, although this may be unreasonable of me, it makes me angry that it didn’t cross my parents’ minds. I can’t blame them though, because as 50 year olds, open conversations about mental health aren’t affluent in their daily lives. They used more of a tough love kind of approach. 
I’m just grateful that I ‘grew out of it’. 

I am much happier now and although I still don’t like being the centre of attention, blush during any public speeking, cry quite regularly, worry and do more checks than I need to, I feel like I am in control of my thoughts the majority of the time. The anxious thoughts i have feel like a healthy amount to have and I feel mentally stable. I have some flaws and I would like to change some things about myself but overall, I can say I love myself. I don’t feel 
like a victim to my own thoughts like I did as a teenager.

I apologise for the long post but I would like to know if anyone else has had a similar experience with their mental health or feels like an undiagnosed mental illness would explain a lot about how they felt and acted growing up. 

Thank you for reading and letting me share my story.",28Feb2020,1
6,"So i've been very interested in mental health lately. Especially everything that has to do with trauma and personality disorders. Perhaps because i can somewhat relate to many of the symptoms that some of the personality disorders present.

This post will serve as rare insight into my thoughts because there are many things that i've gotten curious about when it comes to myself. Call it an introduction.

Over the years i have grown accustomed to a lifestyle of isolation and lack of social relationships. The reason i prefer to stay to myself is because i don't like other people. Ever since an early age i've had the attitude that i don't really need or desire any friends. Friendship is to me more of an annoyance than a benefit. The few friendships that i have had was when i was at school. These friendships consisted of insults, bullying and beatings for the sake of jokes. At the time i seemed to have this weird impulse to hit other kids for no reason whatsoever. Which is probably why my perception of friendship turned out the way it did. This was early life and was my most outgoing period.

When i got into teenage years i decided i was tired of having to deal with other people, so i suspect this is where i developed the preference to stick to myself. I was getting sick of school as well, because now i've wasted so many years listening to some teacher talking about things which for the most part was useless information.

As i was tipping the twenties i was now driving delivery trucks as a living, because obviously society is built up in such a way that you need money to live. Driving trucks was never my ambition. I was constantly pushed into taking the truck license in order to get that profession. It was not an interest or a passion of mine. It just sort of happened.

In late 2019 was my first experience trauma. I had an experience where i was driving a truck on some slippery snow a little too fast. I lost grip and started slippering at a speed of around 70-80 km/h. However i managed to regain control just in time. I was told afterwards that this was a traumatic event and could have killed me because i could have run off the road and crashed down into a cliff and perhaps into a house. This was the first time anyone has said to me that i've experienced a traumatic event. And it was just one big anticlimax.

The year is now 2020 and i suspect that i'm experience a constant state of dissociation, because i realize that i feel very little of any emotions. I also tend to get these very violent fantasies and urges that involve cutting someone's throat, strangulations, dismemberments and just stabbings in general. Here's a recent experience i had. I'll wake up one morning and i'm driving on my way to work. Then i see this person walking on the sidewalk, and i'm wondering whether i should run him over and kill him to see how that would make me feel. The desire is driven by curiosity. I have thought about how i want to do it, and when i supposedly would want to do it. I don't think it's going to come to that though.

And that's basically where i am at today. I have some personality disorders which i may suspect and wouldn't really surprise me if i qualify for. But it's the sort of thing that i don't think i can self diagnose. Maybe i'll go talk to a therapist at some point. Just to see if my theories are correct.

If any therapists are reading this. Then i'd be interested in hearing your opinions.",28Feb2020,1

10,"I don’t really know if I have a mental disorder or not so I want more advice before seeking a professional.

I never feel like doing anything anymore. I used to be active and get my homework done and stuff but now I never have the motivation to get my homework done like I have before. I also hate chess which is something I used to love.

There are sometimes when I get these weird 30 minute to 2 hour periods where I just don’t do anything. Like anything. I’m really sad and think about sad stuff or nothing at all.

My friends tell me that I’m acting weird and not like I used to. One sent me this one night “Hey, you’ve seemed pretty down lately and I don’t know what ur going through but I really hope you are ok. Make sure you talk to someone if you ever need to.” Another asks me if I’m okay a lot. The other times I am completely fine though.

I never have actually thought about doing it but i have thought things like “what if I never existed”, “what if I killed myself”, “how quickly would people forget about me”. Those are mostly during the 30 minute to 2 hour periods when I’m sad though.

My dad always asks me if I’m okay and I always say yes because I don’t want him to worry.

I am afraid of a lot and constantly worry about things. If I see any bug I freak out. If I’m in a plane or car I always think “what if we crash”.

A few bad events have happened to me recently. I went through my first break up and lost my best friend because of that break up, my grandmother was in the hospital with Pneumonia for about a month, and my mother lost her well paying job.

My self confidence has also really took a toll. I think I’m ugly, I think I suck at sports, I think I’m dumb. It also doesn’t help that my friends tell me these things to my face (not the people who asked me if I’m okay and sent the messages, they are my good friends.)

I think that’s about it. I don’t know if I have a mental disorder or not so I want some advice from people before I consult a professional and probably look stupid.

11,"Don't get me wrong, I know I'm real, I know everything happening is actually happening but I feel like I'm just watching someone else, not myself. 

I've been in a bad spot lately, I went out with some friends thinking ""hey, maybe it'll help"" but honestly I felt more disconnected than ever. I've been disassociating for a long time, I can no longer afford my medication and without a car and a with a very young child to take care of it's near impossible for me to see a mental health professional. Even when I feel like I'm in control I feel like I'm on the brink of an anxiety attack.

12,"My wife just got home and I was sitting on the couch that is close to our front door. As she walked through the door our kitten who is 5 months old slipped out right behind her and she didn’t even notice. Lucky I saw him sneak behind her and he just sat on the front porch waiting for me to pick him up instead of running away. 

I just fucking freaked out because if I didn’t see that happen our new kitten would have just ran away and been gone. She doesn’t seem to care about her carelessness at all and just laughed it off while I am here nearly dying on the inside because we almost just lost our cat and she doesn’t care.

If I’m worthless, then just tell me so, so I can take my next steps in my damn worthless life. God, I’m so sick of this.

22,"I will take a mental health day. I will call around to see if any therapists are available to see me but I cannot continue like this anymore.  I feel myself falling apart and I am trying so hard to keep it together.  I tend to compartmentalize and when I look at each thing on its own, I hate it all.  

I’m growing more miserable with each passing day and I can’t deal with the emotions, the emptiness, the loneliness.  

I’m experiencing gang-like mentality at work and it is affecting me. I don’t have energy to do simple things.  I can’t concentrate when people try to talk to me.  I can’t move past one word answers, slurred speech or a cohesive sentences when people call me or stop in my office.  My concentration levels are jacked up. I am making a lot of mistakes at work. It’s getting to the point where I’m getting written up or yelled at and it is humiliating.  I don’t know if it’s depression, but I stutter or forget details when I’m confronted at work.  My boss thinks I act like a child, and I just feel like they are all laughing at me behind my back. People are always whispering when they are near me. It got so bad I had an anxiety attack the other day. 

I broke up with the man I love after 9 years. We grew incompatible and were fighting more and more, and while I understand we can’t be together anymore, it hurts like hell. There isn’t a day where I don’t think about him and it’s killing me inside. I miss him but am being strong by not calling or texting him.  

I hate my body, how I look and my eating habits are shit right now. I keep gaining weight instead of losing it.  I’m not suicidal right now but I think about it because it seems like it’s easier to not exist.  No one calls me or texts me and I’ve basically made no solid friendships in my 35 years. I believe I have sabotaged any real chance of having good friends by being this broken person.  

I’m in debt and I can’t catch a break.  My daughter is turning 16 in two weeks and I can’t even afford to take her out to dinner.  I have had to cancel cable and internet and I called to see if I could cancel my phone but I can’t because I still owe the phone.  I get paid tomorrow and I will be in the hole by $200 at the end of the day even though I worked OT.  I had to use my credit card to buy food today.  This financial shit is stressing me the fuck out.  

I’m not here for advice or handouts.  I know I have to be strong and to tackle one thing at a time.  I don’t know how much more I can handle before I lose my shit.  I need to talk to someone and I’m so desperate to get a handle of my life.  I hope something changes soon and I hope I can recover from this mess.  I’m hopeful. I want nothing but to be happy and to be a responsible person and to be there for my kid.  I want to get over my heartache and to be laugh and smile more.  I don’t want to cry anymore.  I want to lose weight, look and feel healthy. I want to stop losing sleep over this nonsense.",28Feb2020,1

mobile so sorry if formatting is bad. I have yet to get any solid education so I'm sorry for horrible grammar.
I should start off by saying I have a wonderful boyfriend and he has practically saved my life, by literally stopping a suicide attempt of mine and just helping me get thru life. I've had depression and anxiety from as long as I can remember, it's taken a huge tole on my self esteem. I think I'm worth a lot less than others and I don't compare to other women which I've made this clear to my SO. he always tries his best to reassure me I'm nothing what I think I am and that I'm really attractive. last night he was rather frustrated with me for saying that my body is ""disgusting and worthless"", he pointed out to me that at times it seems like I'm victimizing myself and it's just a pitty party because he thinks I'm really attractive and guys and women are always trying to get at me. he's also brought up before that he finds confident women more attractive (which ouch that just made me feel worse). he said if I do not seem to be making any kind of effort to work on my self image it'll most likely be the down fall of our relationship. he feels like all his compliments and reassurance means nothing to me, when in reality it's far from it. im in the process do getting into therapy because I really do want to get better but it's taking awhile to even be able to get into it. so I'm just wondering if any of you guys have any tips for fixing a broken self image?",28Feb2020,1

I always play games and love to chat so I have decided to do both on my Twitch channel everyday for roughly 15 hours! I play all sorts of games and get all sorts of people joining my stream to just discuss everyday life and chill with me while watching me let off steam on games. It might not sound like the best outlet for some but its working for me! If you guys think you would be interested then feel free to watch my stream completely free of charge and chat to me openly about anything you want. Its a great way to let off steam and have a laugh especially if you struggle to maintain a social life outside of work etc. I will be here practically 24-7 for anyone that needs me.

32,"Hey guys, this is one of my first posts so be gentle please. (Mobile)

I’m a 19yo with some issues, one of them is that I can’t seem to love myself or believe that others can enjoy my company. I do have great friends and I know when I think rationally that they care about me. 

The problem is that I can’t always think rationally. The side that tells me that my loved ones don’t give a damn about me wins most of the times. 

How can I convince myself that it’s alright and that I won’t be replaced?",28Feb2020,1
33,"I started back on Zoloft about 3 weeks ago, but I’m not sure if it has anything to do with this. 

- repeating the same word/phrase over and over 
- it’s hard to talk because I feel like I’m going too fast for my brain
- I don’t really get emotions. They’re not completely gone, but they’re very dull
- depersonalization and derealization 
- mild paranoia 
- very jittery and always moving. Too much energy sometimes. 
- acting out a little too much
- annoyed super easily, especially these past few days
- I felt really good every morning when I woke up until today. Now I feel very tired and have no energy. 

Any idea what this resembles?",28Feb2020,1
34,"I don't know how else to put it. I've been having a lot of trouble writing because I can't find the words. My thinking voice gets slowed down, stops abruptly, trails off, or quietly fades out. Random noises replace it, almost like hallucinations but strictly internal. Sometimes it's loud enough that I'm not sure anymore though. Bells, music I've never heard before, voices with such a strange quality that I can only imagine it coming from a monster.

Making an effort to think actively about something results in the aforementioned stuff. It has taken me forever to write this because I keep missing words or writing the wrong ones because the background chatter in my head is saying something totally different. If I get absorbed in a task or if I talk with somebody, things get a little clearer, but once I'm alone the noise comes back.

It's really been bothering me and I think it will go away. I just don't have anybody to talk to about this stuff in real life and I wanted to get it out. Thanks.",28Feb2020,1

What the hell is keeping me alive...

I'm feeling really suicidal right now. I'm quite too scared to call a hotline, I... would rather just write. 

I really don't want to fucking go back to the hospital...

I've been there so many times already! Five years of this! So many, so so many hours of therapy, taking up time where I could have been doing something else... and yet, nothing's changed. Medication as well. 

I'm so tired of this.

This episode was fueled by a thought about my identity... what and who am I?

My body completely isn't mine and i'm not the way people identify me either.

I don't have a name, an age, a gender... i'm just... here .

And I don't want to be...

fuck, what is keeping me here...

Perhaps i'm fearful to die... but soon will come the day where being alive is just as frightening as being dead.

I have to sleep, but I can't...

I've missed too much school over this... my grades suck, and I don't even care.

Happy go lucky college grad taking a year off before starting adult life and grad school. Now it feels like I'm in a hole and I just shut down sporadically. My father is dying of cancer, my professional career is up in the air and I don't have that many friends in my current location (all of them are back in my college town). Dealing with my fathers mortality has taken a big hit in me emotionally and I'm having trouble coping with it. I've always been that macho guy who was good at sports, happy and outgoing but now I just feel like a shell of a man and scared shitless for what the future holds.

 I have every basic necessity, a girl who loves me and lots of opportunity so I should feel happy and grateful right? I don't, I just feel shitty and scared. I don't know if I'm really looking for any advice (any is welcome) but more so just a place to get things off my chest without being judged for it.

Yes, I have mental health issues. I’m not quiet or shy about them. I’m very open and up front with everyone. But this friend will just say whatever comes to her mind. Sometimes. And she announced in front of my partner and my partner roommates, that I have to make sure I pay my insurance, cause she didn’t want to be around me if I’m not medicated. 

That really hurt me, the worst that happens to me if I don’t take my antidepressants or anxiety meds, is a bunch of panic attacks, a lot of crying, probably some self harm (but not to like lil myself), though I may feel suicidal thoughts. And if that happens, I’d bring myself to the psych hospital. Like I did a little over a year ago. 

I just didn’t know what to say. It’s not like we’re best friends, but sure is best friends with my partner. And I’ve never heard her say anything quite like that.

I want to die and I want to stay dead with no thoughts whatsoever. Please just let me rest. I don't want to play this game anymore, it's boring, tiresome, monotonous and causes me some sort of pain in my head. A sort of low battery feeling. Highschool is horrible. I'm stuck with doing busy work just so I can go to college. And I don't even want to go because I have no interest in working. I just get mad sometimes that my parents made me because I really wish they hadn't. If there really is a god and I do kill myself, well guess what, I'm going to hell. So would I rather wait to go to hell because I am a sinner? I have sinned so much in just 17 years, so should I just start my eternal suffering now? The thought of being in God's paradise isn't even appealing to me. I am stuck in a loop of trying to make these last few months of school fun by playing video games, having sex and watching movies. But these things may be fun in the moment I still don't enjoy them. Especially the sex. People and bodies gross me out. The fact that we have organs inside us is nasty. I don't know. I really needed to get this all out there. So I will keep going. I just a few minutes ago had something I guess would be a panic attack. I thought I was being possessed by a demon. Or that God's light has finally shone upon me and I know that there is such a thing. And so I wished for death for myself.

42,"In my freshman year of high school I had suicidal thoughts and occasionally tendencies. Sad, right? Well, it was admittedly selfish, as my driving intention was to stop being mean to other people by just disappearing, instead of solving my problems and becoming a better person.

This is where the fun begins: all my friends straight up told me I was being selfish. That I was scum for wanting to off myself and I should stop being so weak and fix my problems. They said these things to me while I was in a suicidal state. Now, I'm no expert, but I do believe those are the words that drive people to kill themselves and cause the person to be charged for promting them. But everyone else sided with the people against me, treating them like heroes for standing up for themselves or something.

So I really don't know, people in my high school probably still think they're justified, and it makes me sick. Im over it and not suicidal now, so I'd really like to know, was I really such scum for running from my problems?

Got chronically ill and and nerve damage, and now because of my disabilities I'm on a type of pension that you usually get when you're old. I am an artist, sorta, but I haven't done more than a few sketches for the past year or so. I feel so useless, like I'm overextending my right to exist. I'm supposed to do things, to earn money, but the only thing that I can do to make money... Which is art... I'm too scared. I used to make commissions (such as portraits) just fine, but for more than a year I'm just lost. And since December I'm really depressed and even suicide has crossed my mind around Christmas. I just don't know what to do with myself anymore. I have raging Hashimoto's, really bad ADHD, and chronic pain. Every day feels like a fight. Everything feels like I have to drag myself to it, but myself is not a human who makes decisions, myself is a huge sack full of rocks that just doesn't move. Everything is just so hard. Even just brushing my teeth. 

My Hashimoto's is medicated just fine according to bloodwork, but I never got back to be the person before I got sick. I feel like my ADHD got ""worse"" over the years, which probably just means that I'm not coping as good as I used to. 

I have, or had, so many dreams for my future, but recently it looks so dark. I just don't know what to live for anymore. I'm even too stupid / lazy / useless to do the only damn thing I used to be able to do (which is art), even though I failed I'm everything else. 

I just... I'm so disappointed in myself. So goddamn disappointed and disgusted. I feel contempt for the person I have become. I will never achieve anything if I'm not even doing the simplest things.

But I also don't know what to do. I'm medicating my illness(es), I'm forcing myself to get out of the house to do things, I socialize with real life loved ones when possible, I'm trying to keep a daily routine, but most days I just hide under my blanket staring into the darkness and feeling like it all just isn't worth it anymore.

44,"Hey guys, hopefully one of you could guide me on this.

Recently I'm exploring the decision of getting some help in the form of a therapist/counselor/clinical social work (unsure if there is any difference between them).

In what do I think I might need the help?

-Personal Stuff. Stuff that I don't feel comfortable talking it with friends or family. Might be considered borderline legal stuff. And sometimes that thing eat me alive.
-Isolation. I'm immigrant, since I moved here doing social stuff have been basically impossible to me. I went to some classes, workshops, but at the end I feel unable to connect with others. In a personal meaningful level I mean.
-Career Guidance. I went to school, I finished a bachelor that then I haven't been able to use I'm earning minimum wage. And in top of all of that, we could said that my parents and siblings are (partially) financially dependents of me.

Therefore, my two questions. First, how relevant is the age of the therapist/counselor for career Guidance?

And second, One therapist/counselor is enough for so many things? or I'll be better looking for more than one?",28Feb2020,1

Yesterday I had something along the lines of an anxiety attack and I kind of had a ""oh shit I really should seek help"" because the moment was so trivial it shouldn't have sent me into the spiral that it did.

I just feel so stupid about it considering it was just like run-of-the-mill ostracism but it genuinely has a huge impact regarding my ability to trust and just my self-esteem in general, even though 2 years have passed.

50,"So I was recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety and I'm struggling with it really bad now. A little backstory, I have always been a pretty happy person for the most part. The only thing I ever struggled with when I was younger was ADHD and it was treated with medication which I eventually stopped taking. Lately I've been feeling down and anxious all the time for no apparent reason. I will be totally fine one minute then all of a sudden I'm just laying in the fetal position crying my eyes out. I have everything I've ever wanted. A son, girlfriend, and the only thing I'm missing is a good job but I'm close to getting one. For some reason I just can't shake this feeling that I'm a failure. I'm always letting people down or making them mad because I tend to do things that are not wise. I always seem to upset my long term girlfriend who used to adore me, now it feels like she hates me. I hate feeling like I'm better off dead. I have never felt this way before and it concerns me a great deal. I have a baby boy to support and I'll never ever leave him behind but I don't know how the hell to cope with all this negativity in my head. I feel light-headed just thinking about it. 


I don't know what to do or who to turn to. I feel like life isn't fun anymore. Like I have this voice inside my head telling me that I'm never going to be happy so I should just jump off a bridge or something.

55,"Throwaway account obviously. And I already know that everyone is going to hate me for what I'm about to say, but I need to get it off of my chest.

I believe myself to be a sociopath. I will spare you all the gruesome details of the things I've done, but I will share some of them. I'm married, with children. I've cheated on my wife with 4 separate women. Can't help it. Don't want to help it. I feel bad about it but in a very strange way. I feel bad that I'm not living up to the self image that I have for myself. This fucking grandiose super genius playboy. 

I've done some hallucinogens and they've made me significantly more self aware of my issues. I always knew there was something wrong with me. I've always had a problem with lying. I still lie. I almost lied while writing this out. But I caught myself and wanted to make this honest.

The incongruency of my narcissistic self image, and who I actually am is the root of all of my depression and suicidal thoughts. 

I have violent sexual fantasies. Necro, rape, the sick puppy cocktail. I masturbate between 3 and 7 times per day. I have a drinking problem. Basically I know that the world would be better off if I just shot myself in the face. Thankfully, I haven't raped and murdered anyone, or even raped anyone. 

I'm extremely self aware of how fucked up I am. I do think that underneath all of this fucking awful shell of my disorder is a human soul. I feel it come out sometimes when I have a quiet moment to connect with one of my children, one on one. Sometimes I feel it when I connect with my wife, who I do feel some sort of real connection to. Pretty sure I would just become murderously jealous if anyone else fucked her after we separate, if we separate. I have a huge problem with that.

I realise how my I can't even properly deprecate myself because of how fucking enormous my ego is. I can't even call myself out for being a garbage human without sounding like I'm bragging. This is very ranty, but this is real.

I think I do love my wife, or I somewhat do in my own way.

Is sociopathy triggered by events? I can't bring myself to read into it too much because I start seeing too many similarities between what I read and my life, I then get panicky and jerk off to calm my nerves. 

I remember being somewhat normal as a kid, but my mother was so unfair to me as a child. She's still unfair to me as an adult. Always breaks me down in these really fucking clever ways. So subtle so if you were to draw attention to her methods you sound like a crazy person.

I'm pretty sure shes like me. I wonder if she made me like this or I was born like this. My father is a weak beta male. 

I'm not sure, but I'm pretty certain that she wanted girls, and got boys. So now maybe she wants to indirectly sabotage her boys to make herself feel better. Sounds like something I would do.

I fingered my cousin and played around sexually with her when I was 9. She sucked my dick a lot. She was 14. 

Wow I just read over what I wrote and want to hang myself. I almost deleted it, but maybe if someone reads how fucked up I am, they wont feel so bad about themselves.

Also, kind of a hail mary if you made it this far. I know I'm a huge piece of shit, but I would like to change. If there truly is a way to behaviorally train myself to not shut my emotions off and not have all these fucking crazy sociopath patterns, I would like to think I would do it.

If anyone knows how to help a sociopath besides a bullet to the head, I would like to know.

64,"So, I texted an old co-worker because I was thinking about him after my mom (who worked with him) told me he moved down south with a partner.  I never got a response (probably to past burned bridges) And after talking to it with some friends, I decided to let the past stay there.

In the past, I've always thought about how I could've changed my past and was dwelling on it most of the time. Mainly all the relationship I've had with girls with I really liked or valued that I, one way or another, and how I've screwed it up because of my depression. And wishing I could reach out to them. The old co-worker, for clarification sake, was a Transgender male, who I knew before and after he came out.

Also, the fact that it was dwelling on the fact I have no friends to hang out when I'm not working. And I realized I do have friends to hang out with, people with the online communities (e.g. Twitch) and my co-workers when I'm at work (who I enjoy their company).

A lot of dwelling on the past, and in relation to my depression, and wondering I haven't found a Partner yet, when everyone around me seems to have one. So, I decided to not seek it out and just let it happen.

65,"I have a problem, I'm addicted to day dreaming. Ever since I was little, I'd imagine scenarios in which I'd spend time with my favorite tv show characters or imaginary groups of friends, but for the past 3 or 4 years it's been really bad, I'll spend and average of about 4 hours a day walking around my room imagining things, commonly, about a group of really close friends. They dont exist nor do they bear and resemblance to my current group of friends, I just made them up one day and they've been appearing in my day dreams for about a year. I wouldn't mind this that much if day dreaming was all it was, but the thing is, while I'm trying do something else, like study, clean or work. I'll get the stong urge to walk around in my room with music playing and day dream for literal hours. I get different day dreams too, with characters and plot, I often made stories about them but they've been getting weirdly violent and sexual in nature. Does anybody know what's wrong with me?

66,"Heads up - this is a new account I’m going to use on mental health subreddits. I need to rant. Let me know if this is the wrong subreddit for that.

I had a really bad problem with alcohol and I’ve had a really successful recovery so far (90 days in one week). I’ve lost weight, I’ve gained muscle mass, I’m eating well, my heart rate is a steady 50 bpm resting, my depression is better (I think the pills work better without booze) blah blah motherfucking blah. 

It’s great. People tell me it’s great... but I don’t feel fulfilled. The exercise and diet restrictions have been a great distraction, and I’m about to start a great new job on monday. But I don’t know what is enough. What “recovered” is supposed to look like. What sober u/krangbrain is supposed to do now that krang isn’t in control.

69,"I decided to sit down and design my first tattoo.  It's a tattoo related to a good friend who took his life last year. 

Just a lot of shit coming back up. 

I think all 4 of my roommates are home, and if anyone is nearby I instinctually swallow any emotion and tell some jokes. I've almost cried numerous times tonight, but cant. 

But fuck. He killed himself 6 months and 5 days ago. I really looked up to him. He invited me to move in with him our 2nd or 3rd time meeting/hanging out. If i had said yes, he might still be here. 
I was so close to asking him if the offer still stood, but then he did what he did. And here I am. 

Then november last year, someone I went to high school with, one of those people I'd been hoping to run into one day, died. As well as a great uncle I was fond of. Then my grandma died December 10. 

Besides a classmate a few years after high school graduation, and a great aunt I never met, I've never lost anyone. And now I feel like I'm just waiting for the next phone call saying someone died. 

I can vividly remember everything about that phone call. I was at work. My buddy called and asked if I was alone. I said I'm at work, in a grocery store. He told me to find a quiet place, it's bad news. I went to the back room, expecting to hear a friend was in the hospital or something. But fearing the worst. I called him back, he asked if I was alone. I told him I'd go to my car and call him back. I was now having a panic attack. 

I got to my car, called him back, and I dont think I'll ever forget it. ""Um...---...killed himself."" And I just sat there. I cried, but it was silent. That morning I was in a good mood. That whole day I was in a good mood. 

I was finally in a good mindset, and listened to a podcast that interviewed Daniel Kyer. A youtuber/musician who killed himself some years back. And then I got the call.

76,"My mother , age 65, has always been an highly dramatic (for lack of a technical word) person who has really overreacted to the most minor of obstacles eg. lost cell phone, bad food at restaurant, a broken refrigerator. I am not sure if you would consider this anxiety or PTSD because the result of her nervousness is always very loud, mean, and sometimes violent outbursts. 

For example, tonight she had an issue with iCloud where she thought her photos were going to be erased from her phone. I tried reassuring her it was going to be alright but it did not help at all. She screamed extremely loudly, I am surprised  neighbors did not call the police. The issue is the new iphone had something on the screen that said like ""bring your old phone close to this one to sync"". She thought my phone was too close because I was sitting across the kitchen table with it. I told her that's not how it worked, but she said she ""didn't trust me""

I told her to stop screaming and then she made some horrible comments about me and how she believes I am against her. I confronted her and told her this reaction to a technical phone issue was 100% inappropriate and did not match the problem at hand by any means. She then threatened to punch me. At that point I walked away.  Then she claimed she was going to the hospital because she had a rapid heartbeat/ breathing problems and  I was ""giving her a heart attack"". Which I honestly think was just a panic attack she was having but not sure?She kind of calmed down after I left the room but was still yelling from the other room. I put on some music to drown it out. 

She refuses to see a mental health professional. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to talk her down from these episodes. When she screams like that I do get very defensive and tell her to stop because I don't accept that sort of thing in my life. When I hold her accountable it seems to make things worse and fuels the fire...so I give up and forget about it. She never sincerely apologizes or wants to talk about what happened and often attempts too place me as the ""aggressor"" so we never get back to a true baseline. Then the cycle repeats a day later or a a few days later . I really think she is shortening her life span with these pointlessly  stressful episodes, but I am not a doctor. I don't know the proper approach to take with her.  Maybe instead of trying to calm her down I should just accept her for who she is because I don't think one day she is just going magically be a calm person, this has been going on for twenty years now.",28Feb2020,1

79,"I am 17, a senior in high school, I am described by everyone as a nice person that cares about others, everyone likes me and thinks im a pretty cool guy, also they know not to fuck with me lol. I have a job(recently got promoted lol), i have my own car, i have plans after high school, such as going to college, getting a well paying job, traveling, of course buying everything for my little sister (i love her to the moon and back) that i couldn’t have as a little kid, i’m a pretty smart guy, i like helping people and whenever i get the chance to i do, however, i think i might have some issues.

I love fantasizing about violence, beating people’s faces in, curb-stomping people, stabbing people, shooting people, not random people or classmates but particular people are whom i have a negative perception about, which i think could be justifiable, at least in my head. This really gets me going, i mean it really makes the pistons in my brain just pump pump pump, if that makes sense. Sometimes i feel like i would do it if i could get away with it and thats what i don’t like.

These sort of fantasies happen every now and then, and sometimes cause my mood swings which i struggle to keep inside and not show to the people around me (i smoke a lot of weed which helped me turn into a better version of me, more productive and more responsible, and has made me emotionally numb). When I go sober my mood swings come back, my mood can last a day or two or three, or change a couple times a day, it swings between super-hyperactivity to a very calm and bored state, and if im alone and not surrounded by peers that turns into a sad/worthless feeling. 

Im also a little weak on the empathy side, I have trouble understanding emotional situations regarding other people, and i have trouble actually FEELING bad for other people’s grief, not that its not there, its just little. I can easily manipulate people but this is NOT part of my everyday routine, I do it when i have to to get out of a sticky situation. However, i dont use people for my benefit, nor will i feel right if i cause harm to someone by trying to get whats best for me, if anything, i am a very helpful and selfless person sometimes. I am a fantastic liar though, that, i do all the time, its pretty fun not gonna lie, creating entire stories that never existed and fascinating people with them. Ive been lying since i was a kid and ive always been pretty damn good at it.

I usually get anxious at public places, i hate going to the store because i feel like everyones looking at me and everyones criticizing me in their head, or talking about m. Sometimes i feel like im going to get approached by someone and get socked in the head. A complete stranger, i know it sounds insane.

81,"Finally deciding to use Reddit for something productive, so here goes: my mental illness wrecks my relationships. Because I have GAD, my brain always tells me that the worst case scenario is reality, so I often get upset for seemingly “no reason” and never get a chance to explain myself. I’ll start arguments over situations that I only assume exist, I can come off as clingy or obsessive because I’m constantly texting a S/O to either make sure they’re okay or that they still want to talk to me. 

If my depression gets bad, it usually causes me to do the complete opposite. I’m distant and, when I do talk to them, I end up saying destructive things that I don’t mean because I guess, subconsciously, I want to push them away. I’ll be locked away in my room for days, often without showering or eating, and just mindlessly watch TV or stare at my phone, or sleep. 

My social anxiety keeps me from ever wanting to go out and do things with them, because every time before I leave to go to a social instance I visualize a fast slideshow in my head of all the horrible and embarrassing things that could happen and, a lot of times, I’ll just go back home and go back to my room to avoid it entirely.

85,"Depression is a serious mental health disorder, which, on the bright side, is treatable. Depression can hit anyone from any walk of life and of any age. It causes a lot of pain to not just the individual suffering from depression, but also those around them – their family, friends and other loved ones. If you know somebody who is suffering from depression, you will know that it comes with helplessness, anger, frustration, difficulty and a lot of sadness. It is not easy to deal with a family member or a friend who is depressed, and yes, your health can be affected by this too. 

Your love and support for the patient can be extremely beneficial apart from the [mental health counseling](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/) that they must seek. Your role could be primarily to help them cope with the symptoms of depression, avoid negative thoughts, keep them positive and optimistic and enjoy their life, one day at a time. The best thing you can start with is doing some research about the problem.

It may be challenging to understand the symptoms of depression. It is possible that you may identify the symptoms of depression in your loved one before they do. Here’s when you should be concerned:

&amp;#x200B;

* If they don’t care about/enjoy the things they enjoyed      before 
* They express negativity often and act helpless and      moody
* They complain about pains and aches frequently
* Their sleeping patterns are disrupted – sleeping too      much or too little
* Their eating habits are disrupted – overeating or      undereating
* They      have started drinking/abusing drugs or have increased their usage 

Dealing with a family member suffering depression can be tricky, and [family counseling](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/) can be very beneficial to help you manage your troubles. Similarly, depression counselling in Mumbai can teach you how to talk to somebody facing depression in a constructive way. Here’s what you can and mustn’t say to a patient:

What you can say:

* “You’re not alone, I’m here for you”
* “This too shall pass”
* “I will always help you”
* “I may not know how you feel but I want to help”
* “You are important to me”
* “Just      hold on. For me. For yourself.”

What you should avoid saying:

&amp;#x200B;

* “It’s just in your head”
* “It’s just a tough time, everyone goes through them”
* “Look on the bright side”
* “I can’t relate!”
* “You’re still not feeling better?”
* “Change      your mood”

You must encourage the patient to attend therapy whether it is family counseling, group counseling or [depression counselling in Mumbai](http://www.tanuchoksi.in/) – counseling/therapy can do wonders and give an impetus towards healing for the individual. You must provide assistance to the person, in personal, emotionally intimate ways. Something as simple as “Hey, don’t worry, I will drive you to your session and I will wait for you until you’re finished too!” can significantly comfort an individual who is depressed. Any small gesture that makes them feel like you understand and care for them can make them feel a lot better than you think.",28Feb2020,1

87,"My whole life I was a sports player, extraverted, and always happy.

I remember telling my dad one day I wanted to play this sport seriously. Ever since that moment he took my word for it. He sent me to an elite academy, I played 3 hours a day 6 days a week.... eventually I just lost the passion for the sport and quit.  

I played two sports and was an honor roll student, I was happy until I realized it was too much. I crashed and burned and spiraled into a deep depression. I quit both sports, I started skipping school, I just stayed inside all day. 

(Now I’m going to skip a lot of time but touch on what happened).  

I eventually started hospital home bound schooling, then online, had two medical withdrawals, but still remained a high gpa at the cost of my mental health. I played video games as a way to cope this time and my father would always get on me about it. 

I tried everything, I went to one counselor, then the next, then a psychiatrist, I even volunteered to go into a mental hospital, stayed a week and got out.

All of those events took about two years, I lost all my friends, when I mean all I mean all. I still have nobody. I lost my passion and love for a sport, and I lost my ambition.

This past year though, things really started looking upward. I did dual enrollment (doing college and highschool at the same time) and mainly took classes at the college and it really improved my happiness. I liked how classes were formatted, less petty drama. I also got interested in my old passion and love for that sport again and now play for my highschool. I am getting straight A’s again. 

On paper, my life has always sounded great (besides the two years), but I lack the social skills I once had, and college students don’t seem to respect me enough to be friends with me.

That is until recently. There was this girl I took interest in. She gave me her number first, set up a few events to go to.... she really came out strong. My self esteem had never been so high before, this had never happened to me. 

Recently she’s just been dry, obviously trying to Ghost me, ditched two events. I just want a friend at this point. Everyone says they want to listen but it’s so different from actually being loved and hearing someone in person talk to you and have compassion for you.

I haven’t felt love in so long. I missed the highschool experience, I’ve never done weed, smoked, had a girlfriend. It’s all because I just pseudo-suicided for two years only clinging on because I was too scared to end it and I do have aspirations. 

Im just going through the motions of life, step by step, day by day. I’m not living. Video games and distractions don’t even help me anymore. I have lost hope. 

I might start skipping again, and honestly I know what path that leads to. I just don’t see a reason to live anymore.  

I just want to be loved by anyone, even platonically, I want someone to talk to, that I can fully trust. I have a great therapist but it’s not genuine love, I love my mom but I can’t tell her everything and it’s not the same.

I’m sorry how this became so messy and poorly written. I’m crying while writing this... which is amazing in a sense, I haven’t felt emotion in years. I’ve been so numb until now. A painful numbness though. 

I’m just so boring because I lost everything interesting about me, nobody would want to be friends with me anymore and this recent situation just proves it. I’m somewhat smart, somewhat attractive, and I would consider myself charismatic..... but my anxiety just rules my life. 

I’m scared of everyone and everything, of messing up with someone. So I end up being boring. I just want to feel loved, wanted.... I lack the social needs I’ve needed for so long. The only person who cares for what I truly want is my mom. 

I improved so much... but I just can’t do this anymore. Please, give me some advice. I know I’ll never kill myself because I’m too much off a wuss. I just want to know how to love life again. Thank you",28Feb2020,1

Here are some points I want to talk about and maybe get some answer for. It's gonna be long so buckle up:

1. At this point I'm pretty certain I have depression. Since starting university it's gotten worse each year (cliche I know). That being said, I think I've had it for most of my developmental life (currently 22). Since about grade 7 everything has felt like a dream (feel ""out of it""). When I try to be present in the moment I feel like I'm drunk or half asleep. It's like my brain isn't fully recording or aware. To move on to some more typical depression symptoms: I don't find anything fun anymore and I'm rarely truly happy. I'll have short moments of happiness but they're few and far in between. I can't get myself to even play video games anymore. Fun stuff feels like a chore. Motivation is zero. I am almost physically unable to do anything. It's taking everything in me to write this fucking post. My parents like to tell me it's ""laziness"" and that I'm ""lazy"" but it's not that I'm against doing stuff, my brain just won't let me. I have no energy to do anything and when I don't want to do anything I kind of just sit there in this numb pain. Suicidal thoughts are just about a daily occurrence at this point. I don't think I've had a restful nights sleep since middle school. Going back to my motivation: I can't even physically think about things that are even remotely complicated. My brain gives up. I am emotionally deficient. A family member died recently and I felt next to nothing. I'm terrified of having a romantic relationship because of this. I've been this way for as long as I can remember. Every once in a while I get these euphoric episodes where I'm mentally taken to a different reality (usually induced by music and at night or evening). I think it's just regular emotion leaking through.
2. I'm decently confident I have OCD or at the very least the intrusive thought portion of OCD. I don't really want to get into the intrusive thoughts because they are very fucked up. They cause me a great deal of stress. Not sure if this fits into OCD but sometimes when things don't go how I want them to go I get REALLY uncomfortable. 
3. For as long as I can remember I've had sever anxiety that is triggered by literally everything. It could be something as stupid as travelling north or thinking about certain locations. It has definitely taken a toll on my mental development. As a result, my social anxiety is through the god damn roof to the point where I don't have any meaningful relationships outside of my family and even those are kinda weird because we don't really rely on each other for emotional support. This has definitely handicapped me when it comes to operating in a work environment. Everything about a job is fucking hell for me. I have worked jobs but every day grinds on my soul (as dumb as that sounds). 
4. I feel this mental cocktail has probably bestowed upon me the prestigious honour of having ADHD. I can't focus on my school work to the point where it has greatly affected my grades and probably hurt my potential coming out of university (this is what I meant about messing up my future). I'm currently trying to find an internship before I graduate but I'm worried I won't be able to participate in any kind of job. Reading documents and texts is almost a no go for me. I struggle through them. I can hardly even watch movies or play video games if they're not literally the most interesting content out there. Music is another one I struggle with. I can pretty much only listen to a small portion of music as the rest ""bores"" me. I guess this goes along with the fact the my patience is pretty much non-existent.
5. This is a little bit different but I want to talk a little bit about physical flaws or at least the physical flaws I perceive.  Like many men, I'm pretty sure I'm the victim of receding hairline and probably baldness. It's on both sides of my family. Every time I think about it I mentally check out from reality and shut down (a lot of things have caused this actually). My head is tiny compared to my body and not a nice shape (intense ridge from front to back) so I don't think shaving is an option. I also have a really weak chin. Last thing I want to touch on is my posture. It's atrocious and I'm pretty sure I now have a permanent hunch. That is all.
6. In terms of help, I have the contact info of a psychologist that my parents gave me (it would hopefully be through their health care that I could see this person). My biggest concern though is that she won't be able to prescribe meds (which will undoubtedly need). Would she be able to recommend? The only problem with that is I've told my doctor I don't have depression.

It's kinda weird to talk about it, but I have no idea how people usually feel, what is normal and what is not. I don't like myself very much but I'm not ugly in the eyes of society.

97,"I’ve been going through a rough couple of years, and it has influenced my mental health.

A few years ago my mom, I love her so much, got diagnosed with breast cancer. That was rough for me, my childhood wasn’t easy and my mom pulled me through it. Seeing my mom going through so much pain was just so painful to watch. When she cured I thought everything would be fine, and that I survived the hardest part of my youth.

A few months later, my mom and dad divorced for the third time. I didn’t really care about it, because my mom and dad had been fighting for as long as I can remember and I was actually kind a happy, because I thought the fight would stop. At that time I was 15.

I didn’t realize that my mom protected me from my dad for my entire youth. When my mom moved out (I lived with both of my parents after the divorce) I realized this quickly.

My dad is a manipulative aggressive liar. He said various things to my older sister, which caused her to hate my mom and leave her for ever. He tried to do the same thing to me, but I noticed he was manipulating me, so I didn’t listen. He hated me for resisting, and became quite aggressive.

I fucked up school when my mom had cancer, I couldn’t concentrate. My dad is really rich, so he sent me to a private school. I went to school around 7:30 AM and came home at 7:30 PM. When I got home there were always fights. This, everyday, for 3 years, has impacted me quite a lot.

My father keeps lying to me, keeps being aggressive, and I just can’t allow that. Recently we had an incident. I was cooking, he came into the kitchen, moved a pan, I politely asked him not to and he punched me two times in my face, causing my lips to bleed. I was furious, I started to fight him, but avoided hitting his head and kicking. He was hitting my hand and kicking my legs. I can’t trust my father.

All the things I went through, I always just put em away and move on.  But recently, everything has come back.

All the mental and physical pain caused by these things is one thing, but why I wanted to commit suicide has another cause.
  
My dad is a manipulator, a liar, and he’s good. Fact is, I’m really, really good in these things aswel. Way better then my father. And when I say good, I mean really good. I can read people, use them. I make myself look weak to them, so they feel sorry for me, and that’s when they’re easy to use. I’ve manipulated every psychologist and mental coach I’ve been through, it’s just so easy.

I hate it. I hate that I can do this. I try not to use this ‘talent’, but I still do sometimes. I can’t trust myself, people can’t trust me. All people who love me, love me because I manipulated them into loving me. I’ve got much friends but I’m lonely, nobody my age understands this.

A few months ago I wanted to kill myself, my mom pulled me out. She’s the only reason why I want to live, but suicidal thoughts come up frequently.

105,"Okay, so a childhood friend of mine (F24) (let’s call her S (F24))moved in with me 5 months ago because she got a job in the city where I'm attending university. I've noticed that she's really passive during the day when she's not at work, but I didn't make much of it in the beginning. She rarely goes out, she takes a lot of time to make herself go to the supermarket, every free day she has, she spends sleeping and doing absolutely nothing. She has no interests or hobbies, she doesn't watch movies and series, she doesn't read, there is absolutely nothing that comes to mind when it comes to her activities. Although she does sometimes go to the gym for quick cardio. 

S is a reporter so she works a really stressful job and she does nothing to relieve herself of stress she endures. Two weeks ago, we (me, S and another friend, let’s call him B (M25)) went to Germany for vacation cause she took 10 days off and it was supposed to be a super chill trip, but it was everything besides that. The day we arrived was Friday and even though we planned to go out, B and I were super tired because of the flight and decided to stay in to have a good rest so we could have the energy for upcoming activities. S absolutely did not like that idea, the whole night she was throwing subtle tantrums because we decided to stay in and it was really weird for me and B but we really had no energy so we just ignored her behavior because we did plan to go out on Saturday (which we did and she got super drunk, ended up with a guy from France and came home at 11 a.m.). Every day since then she was pissed off, did not like any of the suggestions we had. We visited some of the attractions S wanted to visit but she showed no interest in anything. Her behavior really started to piss me off so I just went my own way and had a great time. B stayed with S until the end of our trip but he also told me that she was pissing him off too, but he just decided to ride it out. I really couldn't let her ruin my trip cause I was really looking forward to it. Also, three days after we arrived, she told me she just wanted to run away from her job and was disappointed because the trip was not what she thought it would be. In my opinion, she was clearly running away from herself.

Anyways, when we got back, she went back to work and had an attack. Her heart started racing, she couldn't hear anything because of the drumming in her ears and she started sweating. Bear in mind that she was complaining about heart palpitations and lack of sleep for the past month and a half. She got scared and decided to go to the doctor. Her blood test results came back normal, her EKG was normal and she keeps moving holter monitor placement appointment. Our friend B is at the end of his journey with depression and anxiety and he told her that she is showing classic signs of anxiety disorder, but she absolutely refuses to accept that she might have it. She keeps telling us that she just wants to get her life in order and if things stay bad after that, she’ll visit a therapist. That makes absolutely no sense and what does ”getting my life together” means since she has absolutely no activities besides her job? I think she's in a clear state of denial. She keeps taking heart palpitations medication and tells herself that it will help her in the long run because she started changing her diet to a more healthy one.

I have absolutely no idea what to do, she is super stubborn and refuses to accept the fact that she might be suffering from something more serious. I feel responsible for her and I can't let her ignore her mental health which she obviously does.",28Feb2020,1

107,"Hello r/mentalhealth,

There are a lot of thoughts in my head right now and I thought talking to someone else might help.

I am 30 yo woman with a relatively stable career, some friends, a partner and an uncomplicated family life.
From an outside perspective, I have everything I need – I should be carefree and happy.

The thing is, ever since puberty, I have felt wildly different from other people.

But I am very easily sad, I have zero self-esteem, I have anxiety (diagnosed), I am easily tired, some noises make me absolutely furious for no reason, people joke about me being either emotionless or too emotional, social interactions with more than 3 people are EXHAUSTING, following conversations in a loud environment is nearly impossible, I'm constantly overthinking and I need days to recover from a meltdown when things get too much.

It feels like I use a lot of energy to pass as “normal”, to focus on conversations I would like to care about but don’t, to avoid crying when too many people are talking at the same time, to go to social events even though everything is loud and overwhelming, to accept people joking about me being expressionless but also too emotional…

I used to think these were character flaws, and I worked hard to compensate them. I exercise, I meditate, I create, I talk to people, I do therapy, I eat healthily, I take off time when I need to. Why do I still feel wired wrong?

On a normal day, I have enough energy to function like a normal person. I will appear as shy and a little socially-awkward, but that's about it. But that requires *a lot* of energy. It's tiring. And sometimes, it feels like I have used up all my energy, and if I force myself to pass as ""normal"", I inevitably end up breaking down.

Sometimes I wonder how people would see me if I just stopped trying to appear healthy and normal. I wonder if people would finally understand how I feel.

As I said, I used to think these were just character flaws. At some point I started to educate myself about mental health and neurodiversity, and it was freeing in a sense, but it also raised a ton of questions. Is this just a byproduct of anxiety? Depression? Psychiatrist didn't diagnose depression. Is it just my personality? Am I just lazy, negative  and oversensitive? Am I on the autistic spectrum, do I have ADHD, is it something else I don't know about? I have been doing a LOT of reseach, reading books, scouring the web, trying to avoid the Barnum effect, trying to find reliable sources of information, because there are so many different approaches out there.


My psychiatrist and GF think that I'm gifted, and that it explains why I feel different and why I am so sensitive, but I never passed any IQ test and they are expensive where I live.

My early school years were a breeze, I had good grades with minimal work. It's not that classes seemed particularly fascinating, things just seemed easy and obvious. Until they weren't, and at some point in high school I had to actually work to get good grades. Nowadays, I really do not feel gifted at all. I feel slower than most people, my memory and focus are average at best and I'm easily distracted. As far as I know, giftedness is not something that just goes away with time.

I highly suspect that I am neurodivergent in some way. But I only partially recognize myself in depictions of autism, giftnedness and ADHD. And I miss some very common traits of both. I have no problem with nonliteral elements in social interactions. But I also never know when it’s my turn to speak or how much eye contact is too much. I often experience sensory overload, I constantly have to watch my emotions to avoid being overwhelmed by them. I often get lost in my thoughts, to the point some people actually thought I was stoned, lol. I have a hard time filtering out unnecessary stimuli (I can't focus on conversations in a loud environment, I can't wear tight clothes, I constantly feel the seams of my socks or the tags in my shirts, etc.), but I always could focus on work when it mattered (at school, at my job, etc.)
I am very easily stressed, but very calm in actual emergencies. The list goes on...

I also do not know if I can trust myself – self diagnosis is easily skewed by biases and things like the Barnum effect.

I'm just lost. I don't know who I am. I wish I could find the right words – simple words – to talk about my identity with people.

Thank you for reading this.",28Feb2020,1

Imagine the whole childhood experience of ""wanting to clean room, mom asks me to clean room, instantly refuse to clean room anymore"" but even stronger and laid out in all kinds of circumstances.

**Examples:** 

A) I try to set myself a schedule to bring more order into my life. If I tell about this to anyone, my brain says ""ok, we're done with that goal then. We reached it!"" and I don't have the motivation to do it anymore.

B) I meet someone who is highly ambitious. Regardless of my ambition level, I feel the strong need to mirror that, but opposite, so by being the more casual and unambitious person. The opposite applies too - if I meet someone who isn't very ambitious, and likes to keep things casual, I suddenly become the most ambitious person and get highly motivated.

C) I tell someone about a goal I have, and if they seem supportive, I instantly lose interest in that goal.

D) I find a new show I like, and if I feel like a lot of other people are even more engaged in it than me, I don't feel like getting too much into it or participating a lot.

117,"Just for the sake of context, I'm gonna just put all my diagnoses on the table. Also, I'm 17.

Clinically decided: autism, DD-NOS, generalized anxiety, social anxiety, conversion disorder, OCD

Probable/things being looked into: C-PTSD, (from emotional abuse) at least one undiagnosed learning disability.

For a while now, I've noticed that if I'm not multitasking in some way, I get restless and upset. That's the easy way I can explain it. The more messy way is that it seems like if my brain isn't taking in enough stimuli, I have issues.

 I have trouble focusing, but also, for example: sound is really important. I have to be listening to something constantly while I'm doing stuff. I keep a radio station that i hate on 24/7 just for those rare gaps of silence so it's not quiet.

My thoughts are also often fast, incessant, repetitive, and obsessive. If I'm not repeating the same word or phrase over and over or monologuing to myself like a dumbass, I'm getting invasive thoughts or what I think are intrusive memories of and thoughts about the abuse I've suffered. They don't bother me much, but sometimes I do get frustrated because of the level of obsession, and the compulsion I feel to talk about them.

All of this seems to give me a *strong* compulsion to stay awake and stay active. My sleep issues shift between being an insomniac, only being able to sleep in shifts, and sleeping for 18 hours straight. When I can't sleep, it's because something about the notion makes me super uncomfortable and I feel compelled not to. It's like I NEED to stay awake. 

I don't have night terrors as far as I'm aware. (I tend to wake up shaking in pools of sweat, but I'm not really sure why) and nightmares don't usually bother me that much. They're also not always related to my trauma, so I don't think it's that.

125,"I have been dealing with depression all my life and over a year ago I started taking escitalopram, which is a big help.

However, I noticed that after I started to take it, I stopped wanting kinky sex? I really loved being overpowered by my bf, getting strangled, scratched, hit, etc. Now all I want is cuddly vanilla sex. It is really quite odd.

And yes, I talked with my bf about this in length and detail, he doesn't mind (he just cares that I am sexually satisfied, the how isn't important to him).

So, yeah, does anyone else here relate? I could really use some insight. Anecdotes, advice, all welcome. But please don't kinkshame me :/",28Feb2020,1
126,"When I’m trying to sleep and I look around my room, the appears to have shrunk to the point where I physically cannot be in the room. it appears that if I reached out my
hand would fill the room. The strangest part is that my thoughts are incredibly loud, they are whispers but more like as if I was whispering into my own ear, a whisper as loud as a scream. This isn’t exploding head syndrome as the sounds aren’t unexpected out imaginary they are my own thoughts simply magnified, and not Alice in the wonderland as it only happens during night and only occasionally - then again I am no expert I am simply curious as to what is going on.

128,"i just cut my wrists but I cut too lightly so its only bleeding and hurting mildly. my parents think im a parasite, a piece of shit who habitually lies. they're not wrong though.

im only a 15 year old with depression, anxiety and bpd diagnosed yet my parents ignored these. i self harmed often and id leave fucking obvious as hell signs but whenever i mention anything about my depression to my parents, they're always like ""oh you'd already be in a mental asylum by then"".

ive started lying when my parents started forcing me to study a lot more than anyone else does that i know of around my age. all my friends agree that what my parents make me do is overkill, even for an asian. whenever i confront them about how stress stacks up because of this, theyre always like ""oh you aren't even doing much, you should be doing about four hours a day"" and compare me to fucking ivy league students. i started to lie, saying i did about 3-5 hours of study every day when in reality i'd just finished my homework to a decent standard for school and just chilled listening to music or chat with friends on social media. i got caught lying countless times because my mum setup screen time on my phone which i can't turn off.

i eventually told my parents that i had to go see a counsellor because of depression, but they were like ""oh its normal for every teenager"" and brushed it off as just minor mood swings. they got a bit better for like 3 months, but the pressure restarted and they've now got into the habit of comparing me with my sister. even when im actually doing my work my parents are like ""oh good job OP's sister at least you actually do your work unlike OP"" or something like ""OP is so lazy, don't be like him"". It fucking hurts because they pretty much disown me every single day saying how im a disappointment or that i dont live up to their expectations like my sister does.

today, my parents kept up the comparisons against me and i was caught lying again. unlike last times though, my mum seemed to disown me completely, call me scum, manipulative and how im not her son anymore. pushed me over the edge.

only reason i cut lighter than i intended was because of that final stray of hope.",28Feb2020,1
129,"Anytime I see people trying to talk about sleepiness, canceling plans, being moody, snappy, forgetting ([like this](https://imgur.com/a/finrqYz)) there are ALWAYS people coming in saying you’re an asshole if you’re like that and your personality is just shit. That they’re mentally ill and they’re not like that, so you should’ve be either. 

here’s a few direct replies to that post:
*”None of those things are 'mental illness' those are personality traits.”
*”Stop self diagnosing yourselves. Because these aren’t symptoms of mental illness. You just have a shitty personality.”
*”Mental illness is not an excuse to be a piece of shit person”
*”I wish so many people would understand it, because to use mental illness as a crutch for the way you act is so.. horrible.”
*”Everyone gets like this it’s no excuse to treat the people who go out of their way to try and help you like shit because of your feelings”
*”You're not mentally ill.”
*”Sounds like every other human being. Dont use a mental illness as an excuse to be angry or aggressive.”
*”Stop using your mental illness as an excuse to act like an asshole.”

Maybe I’m taking this too seriously, too personally, just incorrectly, but these are symptoms I (and a lot others) experience from mental illnesses. Everything about my sleep is awful. I don’t have energy. Sometimes I have too much. I get moody. I have mood swings. I already feel bad enough about them, but this stuff makes me feel worse. Like I’m doing it on purpose. I feel like shit. Sure, getting help is the right thing to do, but it’s HARD. I’ve been working on getting help. My mom is a np, she’s hard on me and doesn’t like excuses but she sees it too. She would be the first person to be honest with me if I’m a shit person or if I need to get back on meds. 

I’m just sick of seeing people acting like just because their personal experiences aren’t the same it’s not true. Just because your ex used mental illness to be abusive doesn’t mean every mentally ill person who has problems is in control of it. Just because someone isn’t getting help doesn’t warrant calling them an asshole either.

130,"I could drone on for hours about how I've struggled with ADHD and depression for years but I recently opened up and started taking meds for the depression and it's crazy to think this is how normal people feel ahahaha, anyways I've been struggling with school. 

I've done meditation, focus seminars, courses on managing schedules and yourself, basically everything under the sun I can in order to deal with my adhd. 

When I first went to my doctor and was like man im sad I think I need meds, she said nah you're fine- then I was like I'ma finnah kms a$ap rocky- she was like oh actually yeah maybe those pills are a good idea. And they've made a world of a difference in my life! 

Now I'm facing the adhd thingy, I don't know what or how I can just get meds and be done w it, because literally nothing else works. I tried my friends meds and while everyone was tweaking out I just sat there wondering when it was gonna kick in. It helped my focus and studying a lot, and I feel like I actually retained the information and am more able to call upon the info from that day!

I am neither depressed nor suicidal, I am here cause I need your help

Yesterday my teacher casually said that people kill and cut themselves only for attention.

I was so shocked. That is just wrong and something you can't say as a teacher. Especially not if you state it as fact and not as your own opinion. In his classes could sit a person with suicidal thoughts or depressions and he just drops a sentence like that.
Wtf

I can't peacefully go on with my life without having said something against that. So I am writing him an email in which I explain why people really do things like selfharm and suicide. And why it is bad to say something provocative like that.

He told me to wake him up if I had a nightmare, but I knew I wasn't going to because he needed to sleep. I had a nightmare and woke up, and then he woke up by himself and could hear me having a panic attack. So he came down from his bed to help me and after, we both went back to bed.

I haven't fully stopped this but sometimes when its very quiet and my mind does what to have silence or just to be at peace I create scenarios / false realities in my mind and speak (move my mouth and all) the words that are being said in my head by these fake characters. It gets so bad that I make scenarios in my head that I either
- start laughing out loud, which to people in the real word is weird because why am i laughing at nothing
- I start to speak too loud to where my parents would ask me who am i talking to while im sitting alone 
- the reality in my mind is so real to me that I sometimes getn mad at a person IRL that I was mad at in my head (reality / scenario created in my head). this is the worst one because i love my friends and family and I don't want to he mean to them for literally doing nothing to me IRL

This, making of seemingly real scenarios / fake realities only happens when I'm super bored, very quiet outside/ around me or when i haven't spoken to someone like a friend in a while. Its annoying af because I never notice it until mid way but i now snap myself out of it asap when i realise im doing it.

If anyone knows if there's something wrong with me, in all seriousness please tell me what this means, if I'm going nuts or is maybe a sign of some sort of mental illness.

136,"I'm 21 years old and I've been in a relationship with a female for around 10 months, but we were friends for 3 years before that. We broke up this past December. Our relationship was rocky from the start because she didn't truly ever recover from her past break-up (which was really traumatizing), and I never really processed my mother's death that happened in 2016. Every-time I drank I kind of binged drank and all my emotions came over me from my mother's death. This happened at-least 4 times where I'd get a little too drunk and make an ass of myself in front of her friends and her. (Throughout the past 3 and a half years that I've known her. She'd always try to push me to go to therapy, and it was hard for me since I was raised to never seek help from anyone, and to always be independent. Also I was commuting to school 4 hours in a day, worked at my school, and attended full time plus having a catering job during the weekends which would be so exhausting, plus try to maintain a relationship. I know, I was spread too thin. Our relationship was good but with bad moments, we'd argue about the little things, in which I can look back on and be like why the hell did we ever fight over those things. 

She ended up breaking up with me and ever since then anxiety, abandonment issues, and depression took over. I was a total mess. She wanted to be friends, I tried, but I couldn't look at her the same way. I couldn't look at the person who hurt me so bad. I tried to do no contact, and I broke it half-way through the agreed month. She just saw it as another broken promise, but me, I just saw it as just missing her so bad. She was cold to me. Really cold. I invited her to my graduation dinner, and she politely declined. 

My mental state was declining hard afterwards. I showed up to my dinner piss drunk, emotional, crazy.  Afterwards I went to a bar and totally broke down, saying things like why did she leave me, why does she not care for me anymore, why doesn't she love me. I ended up having sex with a stranger, trying to fill the void. 

I ended up realizing I lost my belongings so I went to go find them to no avail. The only person I thought that would help me was my ex-girlfriend. Walking to her house in tears I knew from the bottom of my stomach that this choice was going to be a bad idea. 

Her room-mates opened the door and I just sobbed saying I lost everything, and I thought I might have been sexually assaulted. (because I really thought I did) My ex-girlfriend tried to help me, but was very cold to me in the process. She let me sleep over, but I just felt so ashamed of my reckless behavior. My mental health was declining even more. 

Woke up the next morning to my ex-girlfriend telling me that she didn't sign up to help me, she didn't sign up to clean up my mess. Again, my mental health was declining rapidly. She left for work, and I decided to look for my belongings by messaging the bars I was at the night before on Facebook. Using her laptop, I loaded Facebook up, it was her account and right when I loaded it, her and her best-friend were talking about my mental health. Calling me mentally unstable, crazy, saying that I need to be medicated. I felt like my whole world was crumbling underneath me. People that I thought really cared about me no matter what I did were discussing not only the facts of my sexual assault, but also my mental health. Then, my ex-girlfriend says how she was going to invite her ex over that was a huge insecurity on our relationship that night, and that I would've lost it if I found out. 

I was devastated. I was in fact becoming the crazy person that they said I was. I left her house her room-mates gave me a lift to my place, I called a few people and confronted my ex about how I know she's been messing with her ex literally a couple days after I wanted to take a break to try and work things out with her. 

I ended up telling her that I looked through her messages and then she blocked me from everything possible. She said she felt so disrespected, that I invaded her privacy (I did), and that I made her feel anxious in her own home. (declining rapidly). This was about two and a half weeks ago. 

We met up this week to talk about our past relationship, to exchange stuff, and I apologized to her for my mistake. It wasn't my intention to ever snoop around her personal business. I just say my mental health getting slandered and with how low I was just a hot fucking mess. She said she wants to believe me, and that we can work on ""trying to be friends, and regaining trust"". 

I just feel so awful for my actions, guilty, and ashamed. I pushed the people that I loved the most literally out the window. 

I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I can't sleep right, can't eat right, can barely be outside without this immense sense of depression looming over my head.

137,"About a year ago I was going into my kitchen to lunch with my family. As I went through the door,  I felt rather weird and threatened by the presence of my older brother (he was sitting next to my twin brother) as if I didn’t know who he was and seeing him next to my twin brother made me very anxious as to protect the latter.

For context, we’re four brothers but only us three live together with our parents. He was 29 and I was 17 at that moment. We also have a really good and friendly relationship between us three, we talk and laugh a lot everyday. 

Such thing has never happened to me before or after the event. However, when I was a bit younger, I sometimes had these “reflexion moments” where I thought to myself in third person, like being an observer of me for a few seconds, but it wasn’t a big deal. I also went regularly to a psychologist and a psychiatrist for a few years (12 to 15 y/o) for generalized anxiety (that is a problem long gone though).

***\*\*Warning: Possible triggers below (PTSD, flashbacks, abuse)\*\****

Over the last year and a half I've been on an incredible mental health rollercoaster. In July 2018 my husband and I moved into our first home and thus began my nightmare. We both thought that moving out of our unsavory living situation (bad neighbors) into our own home would be an incredible, exciting, happy adventure. For my husband it was. Right after the move he was truly the happiest I'd ever seen him—but I wasn't and I didn't know why.

For me moving into the house caused this unsettled walking-on-eggshells feeling that reminded me eerily of how I felt growing up. I became hypervigilant, always aware where my husband was in the house and constantly afraid he'd be angry with me over the smallest of things. I also had an incredibly stressful job at the time and had been struggling with a chronic illness for the past few years. I chalked up all my weird feelings to that: ""It must be the work stress."" As the next couple months eked by my relationship with my husband began to deteriorate. He didn't understand why I wasn't happy. He felt abandoned with the work that needed doing around the house because I couldn't muster the energy or will to do much of anything. He started armchair diagnosing me: ""I think you might be bipolar."" or ""Maybe it's BPD, like your mom."" 

In September 2018 he came home from work. I greeted him and began to share some of my day. Unfortunately for many months I hadn't had anything positive to share from work so this was more venting/ranting on my part. This particular night was a breaking point for him. He got mad at me and things became heated and he said, ""I spend all day working with messed up kids, I can't come home to someone who's messed up too!"" (He has since apologized profusely many times, and regrets having said such a thing about his students or me.) 

I began having intense panic attacks at night, right around the time were both falling asleep. They were brought on by fear that he might be masturbating in bed next to me (which he wasn't). I have no problem with my husband masturbating—it's a perfectly normal and healthy activity for all adults. I still do not fully understand exactly why this thought would cause panic attacks. I started having them almost every night. The fear and paranoia that he might be masturbating became so great that several times I confronted him in the middle of the night. By December 2019 I couldn't even sleep in the same room—I'd try to fall asleep, the panic would creep in, and I'd escape to the couch. 

I began desperately researching mental health issues searching for answers. I'd struggled with depression and anxiety periodically through my whole life, but I knew this was something more. In all this research I realized I'm on the autism spectrum, (which turned out to be a totally incidental discovery, but definitely helps me understand myself better). I thought ""Hallelujah, an answer!"" but my panic attacks continued. Fortunately my autism diagnosis helped me find a therapist I really connected with.

I ended up in a partial hospitalization program for 7 weeks, despite the help of my therapist. My anxiety was so high that I could barely function. I spent 3 months on short-term disability. With the time away from the stress of my job my panic attacks all but disappeared. The fog over my mind cleared enough to be begin to start processing the enormous amount of trauma in my past, much of which I had never realized was trauma. It was in sharing small anecdotes and memories with my husband and having his reaction be, ""That's not normal—that wasn't ok."" for me to start to realize that I'd experienced abuse. Emotional abuse from my mother. Verbal abuse from my stepfather. My therapist started helping me to understand that I have C-PTSD from what I went through. It explained the panic, the anxiety, the fear, everything.

And now I'm starting to remember physical abuse. The other day my husband crawled into bed with me to cuddle in the morning (we haven't shared a bed in over a year because of my anxiety/panic). He accidentally leaned on my ankle as he was crawling into bed. It hurt, and suddenly I had the most vivid flashback to my stepfather grabbing my ankle and pulling me out of my bed. I can't remember how old I was but I'd guess between 17-21 (I lived at home through college). 

Lately I've been remembering a lot and having flashbacks, somatic flashbacks, nightmares, the whole shebang. What scares me the most is what I don't remember. There are huge gaps in my memory between 12-22, the entire time I lived at home and my stepfather was in the picture. 

Last night I didn't sleep well (more nightmares). I woke up and heard my husband masturbating (which, again, I don't logically have any issue with) and was overwhelmed with fear. I spent the next ten minutes or so stuck in bed, being able to hear him ever so faintly, and I couldn't bring myself to move. Afraid of saying anything because when I'd first started having panic over him masturbating in the bed he would get so angry with me. 

In hindsight a lot of my relationship with sex involved some element of fear. Vacillating between a very high sex-drive and virtually none at all throughout my life. When I was younger I felt deeply that my value as a woman was based on my sexual value to the men I was seeing. If they didn't express interest I'd become terrified they were going to leave me. Conversely I was incredibly afraid of male genitalia. With the three sexual partners I had before my husband I somehow managed to almost completely avoid every touching or seeing their anatomy. I know this was a conscious effort on my part. With my husband I've always felt safe, so I thought I'd overcome this fear years ago after meeting him. 

In retrospect all of this makes me very afraid of the things I don't remember. Was I sexually abused by my stepfather? I honestly don't know and it scares the living hell out of me. But it would explain why I've had nightmares about him ever since I moved out of my mother's house. Why I'll have flashbacks of just his face. 

Does anyone else have experience with this? Or know of online support groups for C-PTSD? 

I need other people to talk to about this besides my husband and therapist and don't know where to turn...

146,"***TRIGGER WARNING*** ⚠️ 

Hi everyone, to make a long story short, I was repeatedly raped and verbally abused for about 3 hours when I was 17 which was 10 years ago, and I have been on a long healing journey since then. I truly believe that my self-worth has been completely restored and that I feel healed and whole. The problem is that while I’ve always been able to remember bits and pieces from the rape but not the parts I dissociated from, more vivid memories are starting to come back and I’m not sure why. I feel more whole and healed from the rape than I ever have, so why now have I been having vivid nightmares of body memories, and visual flashbacks suddenly returning out of nowhere that I didn’t remember before but provide greater detail into what happened? This morning I suddenly had a very clear visual flashback of being forced to perform oral sex on him and while I’ve always known that happened, I couldn’t remember most of the details before. This morning some of them came back. I just don’t understand - why now? I’m not able to go to therapy (long story) and I know this isn’t the best place to ask this obviously but if anyone has any insight, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you so much.",28Feb2020,1
147,"So I have done a bit of insight of myself and I am sharing this here. 


1. I am quite antisocial as in I hate going at social events, it's just not my thing. I love being in solitude and I often enjoy the time I spend by myself than I do with others. However if you put me into a group then I'll have no problem with talking to others. I can get along well but I hate to do it in the first place and only resort to it if I was forced into that situation.


2. I am very apathetic, idk but I'm just like that. I can sympathize with people however. I have been known to give emotional support to my inner circle when needed but I can't feel their pain. I also have never felt guilty of things I have done, I haven't done anything crazy but simple lying, manipulation, verbal abuse etc. 


3. I don't know if I believe in morals but I have my own set of rules I follow strictly. I also am more of a factual than emotional person and at times I have a hard time to understand other people's emotions. 


4. I have no self grandiose and no desire to be a millionaire, I like a simple life as I have very few requirements and desires. Expensive things might amaze me but it doesn't make me feel desiring of it. 


5. I love solo traveling, exploring the world of new cultures and languages, different infrastructures and styles of buildings, arts and cuisines. I absolutely love it and I'm crazy and it's something I want to do for the rest of my life. 


6. I am actually pretty intelligent, I do like intellectual conversations, deep analysis of various movies, poems, songs, characters, scenarios etc. I love writing essays, reading books, articles etc. I often do a lot of research in the things that interest me a lot like politics and I like to be updated on it. I love a good one on one argument/debate. I stand strict with my beliefs. However when coming to emotional side apart from politics, I'm quite diplomatic when needed so I can benefit from being that way. 


7. I actually do not care about others when it comes to my life and if I have to step on others to get ahead then I got no problem or empathy to show. It's just survival, I want to go ahead and especially in work life, people are so cunning, you can't be nice to them. 


8. I often daydream about stuff and a lot of times my emotions control me but I have a pretty strong control over my habits involving cigarettes and alcohol. I can go on days, weeks or even months without it. 


9. I feel I'm have a personality problem, I have no personality of myself but I adapt to the scenario. It's like I have no personality but I have every personality. But I do have a basic identity as I have typed above. It's just that my behavior, emotions and outer mask keeps on changing. 


10. Idk what I really am but I love myself and I think I'm unique. I want to do positive stuff for the society if possible because I'm really very selfish and I rarely care about others unless it's my family. But nevertheless I feel like I'm gonna rock life before I decide when I should exit.

152,"So, I (45/M) got some anger issues, which weren't there before 2007. What happened in 2007? Well, from that time until 2012 I got seriously bullied and got traumatized because of it. Details don't matter, I got treated for it (EMDR).

Now, whenever I see injustice (whether on TV or in real life) or someone makes a small slight against me, my head gets extremely violent and the anger explodes inside of my head. I sometimes end up talking in myself or even screaming. Before my mind's eye I see all kinds of movies of all the terrible ways I'll end up abusing or murdering the culprit. This invariably ends up in me feeling distressed, because I cannot be this violent person.

Sometimes I encounter an issue (inside of my head) and invariably some imaginary people are opposing me and my head starts doing all kinds of horrible things and I get an explosion of anger (all inside of my head).

Now, pre-2007 this wasn't a problem. However, 2007-present it's been an issue. Also, I'm not entirely sure whether this has anything to do with the bullying as thoughts can pop up regarding complete strangers who had nothing to do with it.

153,"(First of all I want to apologize if something I wrote doesn't make much sense, since my English is still not very good and I am using a translator to help me write all this.)

&amp;#x200B;

For quite some time I have been someone a little insecure, however it has never affected me so much because I have used that insecurity to become someone better in various aspects of my life, which has been quite useful and made me happy.

The problem is that lately that insecurity increased dramatically, I realized this when I slept with a girl from work, I was a virgin and she was not, I saw no problem to that but after a few days I began to dislike the idea that she had been with another person or people, which surprised me and I started to investigate on the internet why this happened to me, all the answers I found led to the point that I was disgusted because ''I thought women should not have more than one partner, which was a machist thought '' and I don't agree with that, I think women should be able to have more than one partner just like everyone else.

That's how the days went by and I kept thinking about the problem (I must clarify that I started dating that girl and we love each other a lot), when one night I discovered what bothered me, it was the thought of insecurity, my mind thought ''What if she doesn't like me as much as her old partner?'' ''What if she think I'm not as good at sex as her old boyfriend?'' ''What if she thinks about someone else while we have sex?''

I don't know what to do about it.

To give a little more history, this girl has a split tongue, something that hides because it was done in her teens and now she is embarrassed of it, which makes me think about how her past life was, maybe she slept with a ton of men or whatever and all that makes me even more uncomfortable.",28Feb2020,1

I guess I just like the tease but I don't actually enjoy real intimacy with guys. So anyone who has a shy and seductive personality? It is interesting how this part of me developed since I was exposed to MTV and pussycat dolls and black eyed peas from a young age and that shaped my thinking. I even tried to shake my booty like them in elementary school once.

 I always thought I had munchausen(not diagnosed) since I liked some mental ward stays, but then I realised, no, actually I just wanted to be a baby. I have precious moments baby doll, resin baby snowglobes with babyish tunes. I can act grown up and pay my bills and do a lot of adult things but it is so comfortable being a baby. I love going out to explore new shopping malls, do new things, travel overseas etc., but once I get scared or anxious I want to go back in my room and hide away from the big bad world.

Sometimes I really speak in a baby voice to my hamsters, to guys and my behaviour starts to seem more shy and naïve. I really love my hamsters so much. There is something about them that tickles the child in me.

And honestly that just isn’t enough for me to not appreciate what it’s done for me. I feel like I can finally think about stuff and see things for what they really are. I finally have my own voice and can reflect on myself and learn and grow. In my opinion it’s worth all of the pain and suffering I go through on a daily basis.

If anyone has any experience, am I supposed to try to get a mental health evaluation first and then be referred to like a therapist or is it supposed to be therapist and then referred to eval? Do both things happen in the same place? Are there any other steps to the process that I am not aware of?

I feel regretful. I keep making “what if” scenarios. What if I didn’t do that? What if I forced myself to love him more and fixed our relationship? What if I just stayed with him forever?

175,"My brother and I have always been very different. I’m the quiet book smart one while he’s the loud, athletic one. We both played sports as a kid, though I stopped at 11 while my brother has played competitive baseball and football since he was 10. 

Since that competitive sports took up so much time, it was always about that. It was the only thing we ever did. Until my parents starting just leaving me at home on my own at 13-14, they’d be gone for entire weekends and I’d just be... alone. And if they ever did think of doing something it would always be “what can  my kid do with me” instead of “what can I do with my kid” if you see what I mean. It wasn’t ever what I wanted to do, it was “let’s bring him with us even if he wouldn’t like it”. So I eventually turned to video games on our old family computer, which basically raised me in place of my parents. It was around that time that I began to deal with a lot of problems, mostly depression and a feeling of worthlessness. I also lost my grandmother around that time to Alzheimer’s, and she was the only person who I ever felt comfortable talking to about my problems.

180,"This is going to be a long and boring post, and so I appreciate whoever makes it through. I’m just looking to understand myself a bit better.

My interpersonal relationships are trivial, and I’m not close with my family at all, in fact I distance myself. There isn’t a reason why I do this, I just never opened up to them and never shared long bonding experiences with them. I do understand the value and genuine warmth to connecting with others, but still I don’t even try to make that happen anymore, and so maybe that truly shows how much I value it.

I’ve removed myself from my friends and I don’t really feel either way about it, I miss having fun with them, but I prefer being by myself and not having any commitments or expectations from them. 

I try and act kind to people and use manners and everything, but I realise I don’t form bonds with people easily, and as mentioned, those bonds can be dismissed. I don’t really want friends, but I’m not schizoid as I do care about moments of connection with people that I have had in the past. I want people with me, but I’m not willing to put in the effort I guess of making that happen. Lately I just want to be by myself away from everyone, and this feeling hasn’t been as strong before.

My emotional range is muted, I used to “save feelings” as in if I’m feeling something in the moments, I’d hold off on it so that I could express them to or around people later on. So when I’d feel “love” or appreciation for someone I’d save that feeling for when I could express it to them in person. This is because I didn’t trust that I’d actually feel any emotions, I knew my “supply” of them was limited and I could “run out” I guess. I can’t really explain this well, I’m sorry.

I’m also narcissistic, I can admit that I only think about how I’m represented, and how people who see them might perceive me. This goes from how I’m perceived in public to what people might think of me when I’m in group photos,and I find myself thinking about this over anything else relating to it, unfortunately.

I’m not charming though, which is a trait that would actually be good to have, and I’m actually very socially inept, honestly. This has gotten worse as I’ve been avoiding social interactions recently, but I’ve always been odd, and I previously thought I was autistic. Traits I have regarding that, though, are too few and mild to really be labelled as autistic, though I might still be on the spectrum.

I don’t really have many factor 2 traits, and I would consider myself pro social. 
It’s not depression, I have been depressed in the past, but I’m honestly quite content with where I am now, which isn’t something I should be. I’m really lazy, and I’m not anywhere as depressed as I act. I just lack emotions and would rather stay by myself. I do get anxious and feel fear, though, which is t something that would seem psychopathic, also I’ve been getting paranoid. I also do want to have friends, I’m not schizoid, and I dream about having fun with my
friends, but don’t feel a desire to talk to them or anyone. It’s just my lack of concern for everyone else. I feel guilt and regret, at least I think I do. And so maybe that just makes me worse, someone who understands how other people feel, and yet still priorities myself over them. But if I am that person then I can at least have the opportunity to change and improve.

Well... I reached out to all of them and none of them are taking new clients either. I'm talking like 25 therapists I've been rejected from...

186,"A bit of context, I am an 18 year old dude who lives with his Dad and Stepmom. I've been struggling with depression for a really long time now (I believe since I was eight, I can't quite remember ) it's always put a damper on the things I tried to enjoy. I have a very big problem expressing happiness/gratefulness, I don't know why. And I always seem to stay out of people's way, I don't like causing conflict and I always try to be the middle man. This makes it very easy for people to take advantage of me. As of recently I ended up landing in a mental health care facility for suicidal thinking because I felt I can't work anymore. I'd much rather end my life then spend countless hours a week slaving away at something I dislike. (You can call me lazy or unproductive, I don't really care.) But I recently resigned from my position at work, and now spend my days at home. (I worked full time as a behavioral specialist at a school.) My parents are very avid on me getting another job right away and I can't handle that. I'm very exausted with being forced to keep living each day, nevermind working again. Some other things that are stressing me out are
 A: My girlfriend of two years has been making me feel like things aren't okay between us. I really give my all to check up on her regularly each day, asking how things are, making sure she's feeling alright. When she hasn't asked me how my day was or texted me first in what seems to be months. We live quite a ways away from each other and it's a long distance thing, so communication is everything. And it hurts to think that I can give somebody my all and feel as if it's not reciprocated. 

B: My friends are all worried about me. If it were up to me, I'd cut myself off from everybody and just die. I feel like I cause so much stress in everyone's lives it's selfish of me to feel the way I do. I have such a hard time even texting people that I often times leave people's messages unread for a long time. I've told people so many times to just cut me off because I'm bad news, but nobody listens and it just makes me feel terrible. 

C: I have a very hard time taking care of myself. I don't care enough about my well-being anymore to even want to clean my room, or brush my teeth, hell even just trying to get out of bed feels like a chore. I just want to die, I don't have a hobby besides guitar playing and I'm so self destructive I can't pick up anything else because I beat myself up over things and quit. I'm so fucking tired of being myself. 

I'm trying therapy, I'm trying meds, I'm trying to get out but nothing is right. Everything I do seems to upset someone in some way and I can't ever do things conventionally. Nothing is helping. The only things I can think of to do now is either kill myself or take off in hopes that things change. I don't have the money to go anywhere and I'm so exhausted I don't want to keep carrying on.

187,"I am not sure if this is the appropriate subreddit for this post.. I wanted to hear if anyone had experiences with someone close to them who suffers from PPD. Growing up one of my parents made me quit my soccer team because they believed one of the coaches was a secret service agent. They would duct tape all the sprinklers in our apartment because they thought there was cameras in them. They sent written letters to our entire complex that the construction workers were spies. They went with my sibling to purchase a used car, because the seller could only present one key, they got aggressive and wouldn't let my sibling purchase the vehicle after making a scene- most likely in belief that the other key holder would be out to get them.

 I have a wedding coming up and it is difficult for me to say this, but I do not want them to come. There is no knowing how they will react in a large group setting and religion seems to be a trigger for the PPD, which is an added difficulty because my fiance's family is quite religious. I get anxious thinking about there being a scene at the church as we are getting married. It is incredibly difficult because I know they are caring and supported me throughout my whole life and this is something that is out of their control.  The PPD has been present throughout my entire childhood - Refuses treatment and refuses to believe there is anything wrong with them. I am also worried about the questions I will get if one of my parents is not present at my wedding. I know I shouldn't worry about what other people think but it's been an ongoing worry of mine since I proposed.  Also, they have completely cut out certain family members that I was planning to invite. My other parent was telling me not to invite those family members, so that they can both be present. If I do that, first of all I feel like complying with paranoia is enabling, and second of all, if that trigger isn't present, there's no knowing what else could trigger it.

194,"Hello guys,

I really don't understand my brain, I'm struggling a lot with anxiety and I used to struggle with depression. But for some reason, I tend to have way more commonly feelings that have these symptoms but are not exactly it? I started thinking of this after one meeting with my former therapist (I quit because she made me feel very unwelcome) when I described my struggle with casual daily adulting and her question to me was: ""Is it laziness or depression?""

And, honestly, I think it's neither? She described laziness as hard to start but easy to go on. While depression as hard to start and hard to go on.

For me everything that requires multiple steps needs me to do EVERY step as if separately. For example, when I clean my place, I can't look at it like cleaning my place because I'm physically unable to start. It seems overbearing and unclear. But I always have to cut it into the smallest of steps, for example: Putting away clothes from this chair, then taking the laundry and diving the colours, then putting them into washing machine and starting it, then sweeping one room, sweeping another room, etc.

It's like I can absolutely stop at any of these steps and just waste remaining of the day and I have to convince myself to do EVERY step and it's a struggle.

But I don't feel depressed? For the first time in my life, I feel free, I feel great, not perfect, I have about nothing I wanted to have in my age but I feel like life is good.

Then there's anxiety, I do get very anxious, I'm pretty sure I have some sort of social anxiety as social situations are a struggle and general anxiety as I have anxiety attacks triggered by anything out of the usual and also my work performance and other stuff.

But then there's this... odd ""alarm"" feeling that's not exactly anxiety but like a feeling that something is very very wrong. However, there's very little fear or typical anxiety stuff like faster breathing, shaking, feeling under threat or like dying. It's like when you turn wrong your brain doesn't recognize the area and keeps blasting ""RED ALERT THIS ISN'T RIGHT RED ALERT"".

I'm recently moving into a new town and I get quite a lot of anxiety over it but even more, way more, I get of this alarm.

I'm absolutely 100% certain it's not anxiety or me not wanting to move but it's like my brain can't process this. I don't know how to put it but it's like non-stop of my brain going like ""wrong turn, wrong turn, wrong turn"". And I have no idea why or what it is but I'm literally unable to look forward to the moving even though this was my dream, I have good friends in this town and I've lived here the best times of my life.

Just some more info: I usually have a tight knit relationships: I only have 1 bestfriend that I'm trying to maintain friends with, my cousin and my sister who I live with (we're uni students, so we're roommates) and a boyfriend who lives in the next city. I was never a social butterfly and I was never eager to make new friends, but wasn't opposed to the idea. 2 months ago I stopped taking my medications without talking about it with my doctor, it was the fourth type of medication they put me in (different dose) and I could tell it wasn't doing anything for me except give me bad breath. 

Recently I noticed that I hate being around people, and I mean HATE. I work at a convenience store, so I can;t avoid the small talk but god I hate being with people. I don't like being at home anymore because just the presence of my cousin or my sister makes me unjustifiably angry.

199,"I am 17, a senior in high school, I am described by everyone as a nice person that cares about others, everyone likes me and thinks im a pretty cool guy, also they know not to fuck with me lol. I have a job(recently got promoted lol), i have my own car, i have plans after high school, such as going to college, getting a well paying job, traveling, of course buying everything for my little sister (i love her to the moon and back) that i couldn’t have as a little kid, i’m a pretty smart guy, i like helping people and whenever i get the chance to i do, however, i think i might have some issues.

I love fantasizing about violence, beating people’s faces in, curb-stomping people, stabbing people, shooting people, not random people or classmates but particular people are whom i have a negative perception about, which i think could be justifiable, at least in my head. This really gets me going, i mean it really makes the pistons in my brain just pump pump pump, if that makes sense. Sometimes i feel like i would do it if i could get away with it and thats what i don’t like.

These sort of fantasies happen every now and then, and sometimes cause my mood swings which i struggle to keep inside and not show to the people around me (i smoke a lot of weed which helped me turn into a better version of me, more productive and more responsible, and has made me emotionally numb). When I go sober my mood swings come back, my mood can last a day or two or three, or change a couple times a day, it swings from super-hyperactivity to a very calm and bored state, and if im alone and not surrounded by peers that turns into a sad/worthless feeling. However people describe me as cold and not displaying emotions, i get “youre shallow” and “you have cold eyes” all the time. They only see the hyperactive side when i choose to show it/when its too much to keep inside.

Im also a little weak on the empathy side, I have trouble understanding emotional situations regarding other people, and i have trouble actually FEELING bad for other people’s grief, not that its not there. I can easily manipulate people but this is NOT part of my everyday routine, I do it when i have to to get out of a sticky situation. However, i dont use people for my benefit, nor will i feel right if i cause harm to someone by trying to get whats best for me, if anything, i am a very helpful and selfless person sometimes. I am a fantastic liar though, that, i do a lot, i like being honest too, i dont have anything to hide, but its pretty fun not gonna lie, creating entire stories that never existed and fascinating people with them. Ive been lying since i was a kid and ive always been pretty damn good at it. I lie way less then i used to, im more honest now.

I usually get anxious at public places, i hate going to the store because i feel like everyones looking at me and everyones criticizing me in their head, or talking about me. Sometimes i feel like im going to get approached by someone and get socked in the head. A complete stranger, i know it sounds insane.

203,"Hi folks,

I get sick a lot. Sometimes 6 times a year, sometimes 10. It's usually the flu or a cold and lasts 5 to 20 days.

Various GPs have told me over the years that my immune system should be fine, after checking my blood and other samples. I still get sick a lot. I eat lots of veggies, dress according to temperature and weather, and wash my hands regularly. So that's not it.

A while ago my psychiatrist told me, that me getting sick all the time could be, because I have been handling a lot of stress over a period of years, and that that stress might have affected my immune system. What she could not tell me is, what I could do to make this better again.

I've been battling mental illness for lots of years now, and am on medication for a year now. Also going to therapy.

While pills and therapy are helping my well being in general and I've learned to navigate my illness and stress better, my immune system still sucks.

Does anyone have any suggestions that could help me? I'm literally sick of being sick all the time.",28Feb2020,1
204,"Hello my name is Todd Goldfinger. I've suffered from mental health issues for over 24 years and I believe that mental health is a very important topic to talk about and that we should be very open about these things.

 I lost my father when I was 12 years old and it was completely unexpected, he wasn't sick there weren't any warning signs and he was only 44. He died of a heart attack in his sleep. this death left an unbearable trauma on me and I felt like my world turned black. 

I was completely lost and alone and by the time I was fifteen I had already considered suicide many times.  

I head crushed up a bottle of pills when a couple of Jehovah's witnesses came to the door basically talked to me they came to my rescue. they told me that the world was going to end and so I thought to myself well then I don't need to kill myself if we're all going to die. 

After my father's death one year later I start playing the bass guitar and got deeply into music. I started playing in bands, record albums and played many gigs in New York. 

It wasn't until after college that I started going to therapy and at one point I even when I'm medications for depression and anxiety.

The Medication I took was called effexor and it was a complete horror. I had terrible side effects and felt absolutely miserable. that was the end of my experience with medications until I graduated college. 

when I graduated college in May of 2001 I moved back home and became very depressed. It was the week of 9/11 when I packed my things.  It was that week that I made a trip down to Miami to visit family. 

After a couple of months it became very clear to my family around me that I was depressed or so it appeared. 

It was recommended that I speak to a psychiatrist and I was put on anti-depressants. Unfortunately this didn't work as the antidepressants caused me to have a psychotic break or what may have been a manic episode. 

Shortly thereafter I was hospitalized after having after having an outburst at a shopping mall, where I was taken in by the police and Baker acted which is what they call it in Florida if they don't arrest you but they put you in a psychiatric facility. 

I was hospitalized for about a week and put on a drug called zyprexa, it helped a great deal but I gained a whole lot of weight. I was able to feel good again and I considered zyprexa to be a wonder drug with the exception of the weight gain. 

I was able to stay on the medication for sometime but then it became the kind of thing where I was on it and I still started feeling good and then I stopped taking the medications which I guess is very usual in these cases. 

My diagnosis at the time was bipolar disorder but to rule it out. I had a very good doctor in Miami and he helped me a great deal..

it wasn't until years later when I was married and feeling depressed that my wife would often ask me are you feeling okay are you not feeling well do you want to go to the hospital? making it so easy for me, I went several times and often times it was because I was having suicidal ideation. 

The healthcare in Germany was fantastic I really got the help that I needed I must say but at this time I was taking up to four medications.  1 antipsychotic one mood stabilizer a third one that I don't remember an antidepressant. 

A cocktail as they call it. Do to my erratic behavior and leaving the relationship abruptly I moved from the south of Germany where I was living for 9 years up to Berlin which is definitely not a good place for anyone who has mental health issues.

This was one of the roughest times  after my father's death. 

While I was married and taking all these medications I was absolutely miserable. I couldn't see myself doing this for the rest of my life so I tried some things in Berlin that were able to help me. I'll keep these things that I took out of the video although they helped me a great deal and even healed me I would go as far as to say.

now I'm only on one medication a very low-dose called risperidone and it's used to treat schizoaffective disorder which I got from being stuck at the Moscow airport for 3 days during what appeared to be some sort of episode where I believed that I was stuck in a concentration camp. I had nightmareswhen I returned to Germany that I've still in that airport every time I woke up in the hospital I thought I was in the airport. 

That was one year ago December of 2018.

After my 40th birthday in August of 2018 I attempted to take my life it was the first and only time that I tried to do something like this and I know that it would be my last. 

Since that time I moved from Germany and took a teaching job which I soon quit in Vietnam. 

 in Vietnam  I was able to get my medications without a prescription. I would just go to the pharmacy and show them the Box. 

I spent three months in Vietnam  this good weather a new environment away from my divorce help me a great deal and I found new energy in helping others and sharing my story. 

I started a mental health project called beautiful Minds in Hanoi Vietnam. 

In late November of last year I returned to New York and I started doing a show for Comcast one month ago which is called ""conversations about mental health"" which I hope will help a lot of people.

so my hope is that now I can help others with the journey that I've been through. And that people can hear my story and know that they're not alone and to know they're not the only ones who have ever been through such hardships and to know that they can survive. 

This has been my story. thank you for reading.",28Feb2020,1

207,"I was so happy maybe a week ago. I went back on my meds after taking a break and I feel really off today. I plan to tell my psychiatrist about it when I see her soon. All of a sudden, I'm thinking about way too much. Every little thing bugs me. I feel down. And it's like I have so much to do when I don't really have anything to do. And it kinda freaks me out because I just looked at an automatic email and thought, ""What? What do you want from me?"" Sometimes I have these drastic drops and I feel like I'm going crazy.

just how do i try and prevent very minuscule issues flaring up alot of anxiety

like for example; i have a friend who talks a certain way, with alot of hand movements and a specific voice etc. We (my group of friends 12th grade) copy his form of talking as a joke. Sometimes i do catch myself talking like him on my own. So now im scared ill talk like him forever and im thinking about taking a break from them and am having anxiety about it lol. I do want to break the habit, but like you get the point.

Another example: everytime im excited for something im scared ill die the day before, and have anxiety about it

just dumb shit like that. Whats a good remedy?",28Feb2020,1

211,"I used to be in a weird, kinda abusive relationship. It was just very taxing, but I loved her.

We'll, she grew to dislike me, and ended up kicking me out of her life.

I genuinely loved her, but hated her the same.

She treated me like shit. Playing with my emotions and making me feel worthless.

But at the same time, she was cute, funny, and fun to be around.

Now that she's pushed me away, it's weird.

It's been about a year, and I still feel weird.

Every now and again, I'll see something that reminds me of my time with her, or something that reminds me of a fun day we had. And I immediately have to hold back tears.

Like, I'll just kinda start crying for, seemingly to people around me, no real reason.

It just hurts. And this isn't the first time this has happened either.

She left and came back before. But now I know she's never coming back.

I loved her so much, that it's ruined relationships for me. Everytime I start talking to someone, I just realize, they don't make me feel like she did, and I lose all interest.

Then, after 15 minutes of ruminating on those thoughts ill come to the conclusion of ""yannow what, these are just thoughts and i can be whoever I want to be, im going to be great in life."" And it's just all day back and forth. I'm fucking scared of myself and I'm scared someday I'll act out of impulse and do SOMETHING. I feel really disconnected from myself and my thoughts and it feels like I almost have a demon inside me. Whenever I hear my name it doesn't really feel like that's me if that makes sense.  I have some pretty fucked up sexual urges that i constantly battle with my morality over. I think about suicide a lot but I don't have the balls to do it. If my mental health gets so bad I might just do it tho. Another symptom I have is it is super hard to trust people and i usually get bored of friendships after awhile.

I cry all the time, I've lost over 40 pounds i now weigh 99 pounds i have zero appitate. I have lost a lot of hair i now have wrinkles and from lack of hygiene now have gingivitis and a cracked tooth from me now clenching my teeth while I sleep from stress. I went to have my teeth looked at was told were doing x-rays so i still had my ear muffs on the dentist put the scrape tool in and started moving and since i had ear muffs on it made that screeching noise 100x louder i made him stop after 15 seconds because of that my ear is now muffled feels like i've lost more hearing and now have an even louder ear ring.
