1,several times i’ve been wondering would anybody be sad if i died  (probably doesn’t belong),12Apr2020,1
2,"Long post incoming. On mobile, so apologies for formatting in advance.

I first had experience with suicidal thoughts after my mom died when I was 16. Day in day out, all I could think about was different ways to die. Thankfully I never acted on any of those, but I got very close. Eventually these thoughts faded.

Fast forward to college. Freshman year comes and goes. It's normal, everything is fine. Now, in sophomore year, I(M/19) got into my first serious relationship(F/21). First semester goes by and we're great. This semester comes and things are a bit rough after I got back from abroad, but things got better. We were in love. I have some very good friends, but I was more comfortable with literally anything when it came to her. Then I go to California for spring break, and come back right as Corona is happening. Classes become remote, and she ends up living with me at my apartment for 3 weeks. At the end, I wanted to go back to be with my family for a bit(have been here for two weeks). At this point, I have had enough of my family, and was ready to go back to living with her at my apartment. Before this, she had made it clear that she didn't want to go back to her apartment to live(the person she shares a wall with stays up until 4 am very loudly playing video games). I asked my parents if she could stay at my place whilst gone, a d they said no. Eventually I left. And jokingly said ""goodbye for the last time."" Turns out I'm an idiot and you shouldn't say something like that to someone you love/who loves you when I might not get to see here before she goes back to China and potentially transfers school. Queue yesterday, I told her I was planning on coming back and that I really missed her. I had noticed she had been distant for the past week, and we ended up talking on the phone. Turns out she thought(understandably) that I was serious about not coming back and she thought the relationship was over. I told her that I was wrong and stupid for saying this stuff, but she said there's no coming back as she felt abandoned and was too hurt. It also turns out she met a new guy who she's been staying with for the past two days so she could be away from her roommate. If I had phrased things differently when I left, none of this would've happened and we'd be together again soon. But, because I'm stupid,that's not the case. As such, the same suicidal thoughts from before have flooded my mind, ridding me of any productivity which I exhibited before. I talked with my best friend about it but I'm not sure what to do. She said she would still want to be friends but I told I'd need at least a month before I'm ready for that. Has anyone been this dumb before, and if so, how did you cope?",12Apr2020,0
3,"Nothing happened today, past week I’ve been okay cause repressing everything but why... why am I unable to stop hurting myself. It wasn’t as bad as it’s been before, it’s not as bad as it usually is, quarantine has let me distract myself. The thoughts that came before the scratching weren’t even that bad. It was just me telling myself to stop looking for attention, that I’m faking it and should just shut up. Then I couldn’t stop tearing at my skin until it bled. Why? Why couldn’t I stop doing it either, for the next 20 minutes I kept doing it, why? I’m okay, I have no reason to feel the way I do, everything’s okay in my life, besides some things but it’s all right, right? I’m just being a moody emotional teenager, right? It’ll go away right? I’m just a disgusting mockery of people who actually have gone through mental illness, claiming I have it, even thinking that I want to kill myself and harming myself, I’m just faking it, there’s no reason for this.",12Apr2020,4
4,"Im 19 and have been depressed since high school Id say is when it started. I have been trying to see a therapist but with everything going on I’ve been unable to get in until July. I first went to my primary Dr in January and she gave me a referral to a psychologist. (I’m also dealing with anxiety, anorexia, and ptsd) I live on my own and have felt so lonely. I don’t have friends and feel like a burden when I talk about this stuff with my bf. I don’t want to die but I just have no motivation to live. I love my boyfriend but he’s all I have. I’m not close with my family nor do I have close friends to rely on. Even before quarantine my life consisted of working, eating, laying around for literally all of my free time, and sleeping. I don’t go out or do things, don’t have hobbies or many things that interest me. I just am so stuck in this rut and can’t get myself out of it. Not being able to get myself help, when I finally feel like I’m ready to, has been so discouraging. I just feel like I can’t do life anymore, I just want to be done.",12Apr2020,3
5,"Where do you draw the line between a shitty person and simply embracing someone's personality? In therapy I was told I have a strong personality that can control a room - this was compared to being a superpower that comes with A LOT of responsibility. The issue I'm having is that my housemates (husband and step-sibling) seem to always tiptoe around me. They are constantly questioning if I'm okay and asking what's wrong to the point where I don't even want to be at home anymore. Honestly, I feel like this is just my personality but they act hesitant and almost fearful. Most people in my life chalk this up to just having a more aggressive personality (which I admit is true) but I have also tried to change myself. Now I'm to a point where I feel like I can either change myself completely or leave. Any insight?",12Apr2020,2
6,"I like helping people. Especially my loved ones. I offer them my unconditional love and do everything for them. This has happened many times and many people with me. At first I become a doormat for them and let them run all over me. I feel okay I feel like maybe its supposed to be like this. I don't confront or complaint about their behavior. After a while I start feeling exhausted and I want to get away from them. And then I leave without any explanation, or want to leave without any explanation. I block them, cut them off. When they asked me what happened I don't know how to tell them that they started becoming toxic for me. Why do I do that why cant I confront people. This is so much more complicated than this I just dont know how to explain it.",12Apr2020,3
7,I found out that vigorous exercise will help depression for a few hours.  So do some brisk walking every day for as long as you can go.     If you haven't been to a therapist who can get you a scrip for anti-dep drugs do it.  It worked great for me.,12Apr2020,5
8,"Hi, I'm a 16m from Brazil who has a perfect life and hasn't been diagnosed with anything mind-related ever.

The title sums it up pretty well. I'd say it started last year but things got more noticeable in this one. Everyday my disposition to do things just keeps lowering for no apparent reason. I'm an extraordinarily lazy person and I thought this was the problem until today, but when I have obligations I can do them without a problem. Same thing goes for stuff I enjoy, but now it's different.

I've got a lovely and very supportive family, a great school with great teachers, a huge and beautiful house with everything I've ever needed and wanted and good friends. Hell, I even got myself a girlfriend on February (I'd love to talk about this with her but I can't reach her now). I could be the happiest guy in the world, but I'm far from it.

Today my mental &amp; physical energy just took a massive nosedive through a bottomless hole. I spent 6+ hours on my PC browsing through YouTube and ArtStation trying to distract myself. I didn't even touch the games I were super excited about yesterday.

My mother prepared her best dessert today, which I don't even know the name in portuguese so I'll just call it cake. I saw it in the fridge, but couldn't lift a finger to get a piece of the damn cake even though I liked it so much. I've written two short chapters of a fantasy story I was working on in the past few days, but now I want to give up on it. I did literally NOTHING good the whole day and I was okay with it until I decided to think about the reason why. Why am I just not willing to do things I like anymore? Why am I feeling so useless to myself even though there are a thousand productive things I could work on right now?

I simply don't know. And when I think about it I realize how undisposed I am and it makes me want to cry. It doesn't even make sense but it's exactly what happens and I absolutely hate it. I'm relying on uplifting music and on the hope that this quarantine will end soon to balance my mood. The fact that I miss my gf more than anything doesn't help at all but I'm 100% sure that this is not the only cause since I'm feeling this way since January.

This is a very important year to me because I'm about to finish high school and I'll have to decide what I'm gonna do with my life. But even though I agree when people say it, I don't actually recognize it. For me it's just another normal year passing by, and if this keeps up things won't end well.

I hope some of you can help me understand my own issue. You can ask anything except for personal info.

Thanks.

I just don’t think that I’m asking to much to allow my body to rest, if only for a bit. I’m being pulled in every direction and am unable to think clearly. I’m ready to just breakdown and cry, but I don’t want anyone to worry about me, because I’m not worth the worry. I hate all of this. The virus, the helplessness, the selfishness. I hate it all. I wish I could just die or disappear and be done with everything. It’s not like I’m worth a damn anyway.",12Apr2020,1

I mean, I could smile and laugh, but every time I did, I would realize there was nothing behind it. Like I wasn’t actually happy. I guess you could call it emptiness.

12,"I’m having a bad day. 
I just started this new treatment for my depression, PTSD, anxiety and psychosis. Although it’s promising, it hasn’t kicked in yet. My psychiatrist built it up to be this amazing cure and it’s just not. At least, not yet. 
I feel so sad today it feels like there’s a black hole in my chest sucking out my soul and everything inside me. 
I reached out to a friend and they said I’m an intense person to be friends with because of all the suicide attempts and self harm and other stuff, and that they needed space from me. My aunt calls me emotionally fragile and my mom only answers the phone if she’s prepared to deal with me in a crisis. 
It’s like everyone only sees my mental illness, and not me. I feel like a walking mental illness because of it. I’m lost and I’m broken. Maybe I am nothing more than a walking mental illness. Maybe everyone is right, and maybe I’ll always be this broken heap of sadness and pain.",12Apr2020,1

14,"TW: self harm / suicide






I’ll probably delete this. I’m in a really bad state of mind. I used to scratch my arms as a form of self harm. 
Today I tried to kill my self. Sort of. Day after day it’s something else. My partner reaching out to a girl he was in love with, him not telling me right away, before then continually telling me I’m the worst girlfriend he’s ever had and can’t wait to leave me. I can’t ever keep this house clean. We are running out of food but I’m too terrified to go to the store. Constantly being reminded of how fucking weak I am. I have so much going through my head I want it to stop. I’ve thought about it for what feels like forever but I’m reaching a point that I just don’t see the purpose anymore. At all really. 
It’s too much to explain. All in all I took the only kitchen knife we had, went to the bathroom and attempted to slit my wrists. It was too dull to do anything. I tried multiple times. Nothing. Just scratches and creases. I’m balling my eyes out because I can’t even do that right. 
Now I’m just sitting on the bathroom floor. My partner kept asking through the door what I was doing. I lied. Said nothing. Over and over. Then he asked where the knife was. I said I don’t know. He said to open up the door, he dreamt last night that I killed my self, that I bled out in the bathtub. I chuckled. That’s what I was trying to do. I hid the knife and opened the door. He didn’t search for it. I shut him back out. I don’t know what to do. I feel so empty, and sick. 
I can’t escape anything. Any of the pain. I just want it to stop. I can’t even help him through his issues either. Why am I here. I’ve quite literally fucked up anything you can think of. I can’t do it anymore",12Apr2020,2

16,"This is my first time reaching out for any sort of help with a mental health issue, so I'm not entirely how. That said, I'm struggling---and that's a weird thing for me to admit. But I am. As days are going by, I feel myself lapsing further and further into loneliness and sadness (depression?), and it's beginning to scare me. With everything happening in the world, I guess I'm reaching out to see what resources you'd recommend to use given the lack of in-person resources. I'm not sure what exactly I want, although I think being able to speak honestly, and have someone listen and offer their thoughts would be a big help.... and I think I just described a therapist. But maybe you may know an ulterior resource that could help.

17,"I’ve never had a history of depression. My junior year of high school I was very sad, probably even depressed. But it was never officially diagnosed, so there’s no way to know for sure. Other than that, for the rest of life I’ve always been relatively happy.

Until some things started to change recently. Last May, I graduated high school and was probably the happiest I’d ever been. Had a promising future in the marine corps, a great girlfriend, amazing group of friends, loving family, a good savings account, great health, yada yada. Then I lost almost all of it.

Things started going south after I got to boot camp, got hurt and sent home. My friends and I started drifting, the girl and I split, had to dig into my savings significantly to fix my health, which prevented me from working properly. I continued to get more and more distant from almost everyone, but I still kept my head held high, because, as I said, no history of depression and always been relatively happy.

Well, I was finally starting to get back on my feet after around six months of that. Injury finally fully healed in January, and could work. Still didn’t have a medium of making friends, and the ex girl and I now were not on good terms (now blocked). I was about to get into the military after many months of paperwork and pleading for reenlistment.

Then corona happened, and ruined it all. Got laid off, rejected for enlistment, and my friends and I are more distant than ever. No idea what I want to do with my life, other than I love airplanes and want to be a pilot, but can not afford the school and can’t get a job for obvious reasons. I’d love some friends or even a girlfriend but again, no medium to meet people and I don’t want to force it, since I want some genuine relationships. I’m worried this is going to turn into a depression if I don’t do something about it.

20,"Please remove if this is not the right place to post this. Also, on mobile so I’m sorry for formatting and everything. 

I’ve(32F) struggled with mental health (bipolar/panic disorder) for my entire life. These past few years I’ve made a tremendous amount of life changes and developed a solid set of coping skills. The frequency of panic attacks went way down, I weaned off meds, things were fantastic. Then out of nowhere, **BAM** ... global pandemic. Now my usual coping skills aren’t helping. I’m in contact with my doctor and therapist but I can’t shake this heartache. I find myself crying every night thinking of all the people around the world who are dying scared and alone. I’m scared for the healthcare workers who are going in every day knowing they’ll probably get sick but are going in anyway and holding the hands of people who are literally dying and can’t have their families around them. I’m heartbroken for the people who are losing loved ones, whole families in some cases. I’m a teacher and I can’t stop crying for my students who’ve lost family already. I can’t stop crying over the people who have no one or nothing to help them cope with this. I think about that mass grave in New York and I can’t stop crying. I could go on and on. 

I’m crying nightly. It feels very different from a panic attack, it feels like sorrow, like grieving hundreds of thousands of people and it’s so heavy and so painful, I really haven’t figured out a good way to cope with it. I cry for all you too, for your losses and your struggles, and for all the hardships we have ahead of us when we begin to recover. 

I really don’t know what else to say, I’m sure you guys are feeling this too. Any suggestions of favorite coping skills that have helped you?",12Apr2020,6

24,"I'm diagnosed with ADHD and generalized anxiety. I have these really weird moods I get into. I get extremely happy for no apparent reason, like over the top though.

I can do public speaking, and make friends easy in these moods. I can do everything I can't usually do. I have no sense of danger or fear at all in these times. Always happens after a period of deep sadness and fatigue and all that fun stuff. It is weird. It feels so unlike me. I feel so extroverted fun and invincible in these moods. Everything that makes me sad and worrisome? Nothing bothers me, just over the top happiness. There is literally no reason behind it ever. I don't know where this really positive energy is coming from if I am usually so depressed nervous tired and just...oof most of the time.

28,"I don't really know where to start. Back in January I guess. Things were going decent at my job but there was definitely something wrong. I was going through almost full day crying spells. It was getting hard but I powered through.

Not long after that my boyfriend was fired. I thought not having him there would make it easier to focus but the crying and anxiety attacks got worse. Then one morning I accidentally bumped into a girl and she called me a fat ass. I just launched into a panic attack I couldn't come back from. My boss was trying to understand what was wrong but pretty much gave me the ultimatum of taking a (minimum 30 day) person leave or getting back to work.

The leave system shit out and pretty much autofired me for missing work. It took until the beginning of March to get it sorted out and hired back on. At that same time, my job lifted their missed time penalty.

Since then I've managed to work through one full shift, one half shift, and maybe five 1-3 hours shifts. I don't know what's wrong. It's just like I walk in and my flight or flight kicks in. I can feel the anxiety creeping in the more I look around. If I manage to pull myself through getting there I get to my station and start checking the clock. I've tried covering it up. I've tried swearing to myself I won't look. I do though. I start checking every 30 seconds and freaking out because it's not moving. Then I start to feel like I'm stuck there. I spend the rest of the time trying to calm myself down until I finally just say ""okay okay you'll leave in an hour"". Then I immediately clock out and leave because I feel like I can't take another second.

I lost my insurance. So I can't even get into counseling. I can't even try to go back to my old job. I was miserable there but at least I could do it. Unfortunately, they're bare bones in the current pandemic and have been on a hiring freeze since Christmas.

I'm here to ask a favor of any redditor to take 10 seconds out of their day to help make a difference in my girlfriend's mental health. My girlfriend has been suffering with depression and mental health issues for the last year and I have tried my best to support her as much as possible. With this whole covid pandemic, I've noticed that her mental health has gotten alot worse. I suggested her to create a instagram food page to display local Toronto restaurants and foods she's been to to pass her time (she's a huge foodie). After creating her account, she immediately changed her attitude and mood and you can clearly tell she seemed alot happy. Its almost like she found a new passion and purpose and it has made her into a happier person. The moment someone likes a single post or follows her, she jumps for joy and it resembles a child waiting for santa. So I've come to reddit to help me make a difference in my girlfriend's life. Please if you have any time out of your day to follow her food instagram page, it would be much appreciated. IG: eatendlesslywithus.

I am not trying to make this instagram page popular, nor do I wish this page to get famous. It just makes me happy to see my girlfriend finally happy, and I can't describe that feeling to anyone. So If you do decide to follow, we aim to create great content and display some of the greatest restaurants and food the city has to offer. Toronto has some of the most diverse food and we want to share our experience with everyone!

Update: Thank you to everyone who followed, my gf is jumping up and down in joy

Update 2: We’ve went from 30 followers to 200 in less than 2 hours, and my gf still doesn’t know it’s through the help of Reddit. But all I can say is thank you from the bottom of my heart. Let’s get this account to 1000",12Apr2020,329

i don’t have any mental illnesses (that i know of), but there are genuinely some moments where i just blank out.

after this i usually sit around doing nothing (or at least try to stimulate my brain by watching something, although i’m not very interested in it) and it bothers me. i get irritable and feel hopeless. i could honestly feel fine before hand (hell, i’d be in a really good mood, even) and it would still happen.

could i just be stressing myself out with the thing i’m doing and thus causing displeasure towards it? i often get frustrated with my lack of ability to draw what i want to, do that could definitely be a factor for that, but i just want to know how i can get out of the unmotivated funk.",12Apr2020,1

I come from a place of tears. I come from a place of being alone. I come from a place where I was never good enough, to anyone. I come from a place of abuse, emotionally, mentally, physically. I come from a place of being afraid. I come from a place of not knowing who I am supposed to be. I come from a place of insecurity. I come from a place of hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone else.

My logic is irrational.  Anything that happens is my fault. Nobody truly loves me. I don't feel like I belong in my world, yet I am nothing without my people. I love my husband. I love my kids. I despise myself. 

I want to be different. I want to be better. I want to be enough for my husband, I don't believe I am. I also know, these thoughts about myself will eventually come between us. Nobody wants to be or deserves to be around this, these fears, these anxieties, this sadness. 

I appear happy. I smile as much as I can, but inside I am anger. I am hurt. I want pain. Pain is all I know. As a child I self harmed. As an adult I do the same. 

I don't want to kill myself. I just don't want to exist.

I mean every since I heard about that girl taking her on life last week it’s really bothering me like I can’t shake the damn negative feelings that surround it my heart goes out to her family and I can’t help but feel angry that she did such a selfish thing to her family as well and right before Easter. Honestly I want my life and what I do to matter that’s why I’m choosing to take this lockdown and soul search more not saying I haven’t I have being single and alone you have choices I chose to better myself and work on myself my mental health means more to me then anything ever will you if my mental health isn’t in check I can’t function like how I need to, I can’t communicate my needs, wants desires I mean I feel guilt about shit that I absolutely have no control over like the media tells us to reach out to people well I have and they haven’t responded and I know they struggle with mental health issues but it’s exhausting I get frustrated when the consider gesture isn’t recognized if that makes sense it’s like a one sided conversation.",12Apr2020,2
38,"i have been picking at scabs and my fingers for years. When i was younger i would deliberately scratch at mosquito bites to make them bleed so they would scab and i would have something to pick at after years of doing this my legs were left coverd in scars  and  they were ugly thankfully most of th scars have faded but some are still there... i would also pick at other cuts on my body  and no matter how hard my dad would slap my hand (he didn't do it to be mean he just did it to try to get me to stop which would just annoy me more thus making me pick more) It would never work. i still pick at scabs and cuts on my body but i don't go out of my way to make them anymore (unless i self harm but that's different)  but there Will always be a 99% chance that cut will scar  because i cannot stop picking at it. And i now have so many scars all over my body because of it. i also pick at my fingers. i have been doing this for as long as i can remember and throughout the years it's just gotten woes to where i'm sitting on my bed for hours picking my fingers into bloody stumps because  for some reason i have to get every single  fucking tiny piece of skin that i can.... I have tried to stop. i have tried telling my self not to do it but that just makes me want to do it more i have also tried bad teasteing nail polish but i just stopped biteing my fingers and started pulling at them instead then after i stooped using the nail polish because i thought i didn't need it anymore i went straight back to biteing my fingers.  It's gotten to the point where whenever i see a hang nail or anything sticking off my fingers i have to stop what i'm doing right away to pull it off or else it will physically bother me untill it's gone.... i have tried talking to my mom about this but  she just sits there and gives me the Same useless and mainly stressful advice she gives me about my eating disorder. ""just stop. If you commit to stopping you Will stop"" so she's never much help. but again like my eating disorder this is a problem i have had for as long as i can remember and i literally cannot just stop.

39,"i feel like there's rarely any spaces to discuss this kind of thing without judgement and. i hope this can be one of them.

when i feel bad, or i'm upset be it with someone or in general i have fantasies/impulses to do things that will worry other people, make them feel bad, or just get some kind of reaction out of them. i think about \*trying\* to kill myself, but not actually dying or saying something passive aggressive so the other person will worry and cater to my feelings and i keep getting images of people's reactions if i did, which i know are fictionalized because people don't react the way you want them too and honestly they rarely care that much.

i want to make clear that although i've been passive aggressive and manipulative in the past, it's been at least a couple of years since i've acted on those impulses save for a few minor episodes which i've always apologized for. but it's a real struggle trying not to do these things. it's draining and painful and a constant cycle of mentally abusing myself for being such a terrible person for even having those thoughts. it's tiring.

sometimes when i self harm there's that little part of my brain that thinks of it as some kind of vengeful act which brings both some comfort and self-loathing, and obviously i never tell, never show anyone or really think it's someone else's fault, but in the moment that little fantasy of 'now they'll be sorry' feels good, as twisted as it is.

i can't see my therapist right now because of the quarentine so i've got virtually no one to talk about this because i know people will judge me for it and doubt my intentions any time i display negative emotions. i keep thinking i should just isolate myself, that it would be easier both for me and other people, but i know that's not a real solution and no way of getting better.

i'm not really expecting advice or anything (though it would be appreciated) since i know probably a lot of us deal with it and there's no clear cut to fix this. i guess i just wanted to vent and maybe seek support, so if you read this, thank you.",12Apr2020,2

This feels weird because other girls my age (16) might be going through a rebellious phase or fight a lot or say they hate their parents but at some point they loved their family. I can’t remember a time I actually loved my mother or sister. Especially not my sister. Since she was born I’ve absolutely despised her and honestly been quite awful to her. I hate my mother as well. Just being stuck in a room with these two starts to make me legitimately upset and tense. Their very presence annoys me knowing they think I love them makes me extremely angry. I don’t feel this amount of rage towards any of my family members. Even my shitty bio dad. I want a good relationship with the closest family I have but no matter what I can’t seem to stop despising everything about these two. I’m sorry if this sounds like some serious teen angst but I’m actually rather concerned and it’s really upsetting knowing I’ll probably never feel close to the two women who should be the most important people in my life.

45,"Hi! I want to start off by telling you that I had a pretty rough childhood full of secrets and dealing with my mother who had really bad bipolar, she would go to the mental hospital a lot and abuse us kids (5 of us) when she was home. That only really started when I was 13 (I’m 18 now). My father was always manipulative and made me hate my mum and over the years I’ve had to re build a relationship with her. I’m not sure if it is relevant but I thought I might as well share.

So, when I was a child, from as young as I can remember, if I was ever In a room alone and I heard someone call my name or coming down the hall way my body would slightly shake and I’d do anything I could to find a hiding spot in time, before whoever got there. I would come out like it was nothing and I was fine. This continued on until sort of recently, I still get the urge to do it but I can control it. I have really bad anxiety these days, I’ll cry just because I spoke to loud or I did something slightly embarrassing. I think the hiding thing could be early stages of anxiety, I just find it strange because I was doing that before any of the serious stuff (I can remember happening) actrually happened to me!

I will no longer feel like I'm in my body anymore and I even sort of feel possessed by an evil entity like I'm going to kill someone even though I never would. But like... Boyfriend was worried and was going to hug me and I got super scared and started backing away from him. I knew who he was but I felt like I didn't know him and I felt scared of him like he might kill me. I felt so removed from myself and felt like I didn't recognize my own hands. And... Sometimes when I'm like this, I snap out of it so fast and will be giggly and outgoing... But other times I don't. What is this experience???

47,"I just finished my first go at therapy with an intern therapist that lasted roughly 8 or so months. I’d formed quite the attachment to her as she was the first person I’ve ever really been able to open up to and my work with her has been responsible for some really great changes in who I am as a person. This alone would have made it difficult as is but we didn’t get to properly end the therapy. The shitty ass clinic abruptly canceled their intern program thanks to covid-19 with no intention of explaining what happened. After almost a month of just hearing “she’s currently unavailable and you may have to be scheduled with a new therapist” I finally got some sort of info. My therapist waited weeks to get permission from the clinic to reach out to her clients and inform them of what had happened. She reached out through a temporary number and told me what I just mentioned and that the clinic won’t allow any further contact so I needed to ask anything I wanted to know then and there. We talked about how the therapy didn’t exactly end properly, I updated her on how my situation had changed over the past month, we establish that she has complete faith in the idea that I’ll meet my goals based on the progress she’s seen in me, and I wished her luck in her future career. It felt good to at least get some sort of closure through this phone call but it still feels almost as if I’m grieving a death in a way.

The other shrink told me I for sure have a psychopathic tendencies, but the other said I'm also not psychopath because I certainly have emotions and I can see other people point of view, while they may be supressed, I do have them. I'm aware of it myself too..

I can also mimic or not mimic any disorder I want to. I don't understand this.

There was a time, I was ultra raged, drunk and I was sent to a mental hospital, I was released after about 7 days with results ""Had a good behaviour, cooperated, alcohol intoxication was cause of that, we see no problems here."" and that was only because I lied straight to their eyes, to the doctors here, I just think they believed me so they've released me. Average patients are locked up here for more than 6 weeks.

It's scary, I wasn't 100% realising that back then, but now I do. I sometimes tend do things and then lie about them just for the joy of it, and there is absolutely no purpose. People believe me cause ""Why would he lie? He'd never"".

my everyday life isn't so different from quarantine life - i stay at home and go on my computer, smoke, make music, and do school work. i leave the house to go to the gym or get food or go to school, and sometimes i hang out with a friend. i even take online classes when i can so as to not have to go into class lol. but overall, my quarantine life isn't much different from my usual life; only now all my classes are online and i have to work out at home and can't hang out with friends, all of which i'm okay with.

anyway, i'm always bored and i want to know who else experiences this, and what you do to help it. it's been a problem for awhile now - for example, i've always hated school because i find it so boring. i hated school so much that i walked out freshman year of high school and refused to go back, and then i did online school the rest of high school.

 i even feel bored with friends a lot. i feel like i just end up acting and putting on a good face while sitting through the boredom and emptiness (this isn't always, sometimes i do actually have fun). but most of the time i'm just waiting to get back home to my room. and then i get to my room and i'm still bored, but i prefer my room. however, constant boredom at home has caused some unhealthy coping mechanisms. i smoke when i'm bored (multiple times a day, i'm a stoner), i eat when i'm bored, and i find things to obsess over (for example, i currently am obsessing over my spotify playlists. i've been making, deleting, re-making, renaming, and editing playlists and their songs for like a week now. however, a lot of times i'll obsess over something that i can research on the computer). other things i do to try to help boredom is play video games, make music, make tiktoks, and excessively walk around my block. i always try to watch a movie or tv show to cure the boredom but i can never pay attention to it because i get bored, so i end up on my phone or searching something on a different tab.

55,"I'm only 22 and already exhausted, I don't wanna do anything. I don't wanna know about hustling or hard things, don't wanna fight, don't wanna struggle. I just feel extremely tired physically and mentally.

A little about my background: 

I was raised in a single parent household and to this parent I was their emotional pillar since I could remember, I was a shoulder to cry and someone to confide. I think one of my first memories was me probably 4 years old holding this parent while they cried and I myself was crying too because I didn't knew what to do. When I grew up a bit I stopped crying. 

I suffered a lot emotionally, I grew up seeing a lot of ugly things: cheating, lying, domestic and criminal violence (thank God not inside my home, but close enough to see, hear and fear), poverty, people being evil and cruel just because they can, sickness, death and much, much more. I endured it all, I've learned to swallow my bad feelings because I need to be there for someone who is worse, to not be angry even when people explode at you because you know they are hurt and it's not personal. While this all was happening I still needed to go to school so I could do something for myself (and I'm deeply thankful for this privilege).

I've had to deal with all of it, every since I can remember, all this adult problems, this big problems and awful situations that seemed out of a badly written soap opera. I've felt so much despair and helplessness I could taste it. I don't know how many times I tought I would go insane after so much stress and sleepless nights having to help my parent to take care of my grandparent with Alzheimer's. 

I feel like I'm being a whiny bitch. So many people have so much worse, I've seen with my two eyes. But I'm so God damn tired.

I'm in the end of my college journey right now. I don't even know how I got to this point, there are years missing from my memory, I think I just got into autopilot and powered through. But recently even this is falling apart, now even my brain can't take it anymore, every single text that I read, every single activity, is so hard - I can't concentrate or think, I feel so dumb.

Even the things I did for fun I can't do like before: read a book, watch a movie, write, watch YouTube for gods sake. My brain doesn't seem to concentrate, and God forbid anything sad or emotional, because I can't take it. I don't have peace inside my head, to be quite honest I feel tormented. I can't say if my depression and anxiety are getting worse or if it's just harder to run away from them. 

I'm at a point that there's nothing I want to do (not even fun things), I joke a lot about being ready for retirement, but honestly I feel that life sucked my dry and I just wanna rest and don't have to worry about anything. Now that's my time to fight for myself and be full of energy I just feel dead tired an worn out, I don't wanna get out of bed. I don't think I have dreams anymore, all I want for my future is to pay my bills and feel safe for once.",12Apr2020,23

I was studying so much I wasn’t thinking about helping around the house. She said she would kick me out if I didn’t smarten up.Sometimes in the past thoughts would pop up in my mind about hurting people and killing them. These thoughts are vary disturbing to me, I think I’m a nice person and would never do anything like that. I have talked to a few therapist and they say it’s normal. They still make me feel bad, they make my anxiety go up more. Thinking about hurting others makes me feel like I’m a horrible person and they make me thing, why would you even think of that ? 

I tried talking to one of those help lines, through text. Just to vent and get it out but the whole time it just felt like scripted responses and her just making sure I wasn’t suicidal. And then she ended the conversation too soon, warning me towards the end that she was ending it in a few minutes. I was going to leave her a bad review but then I thought, there was a real person at the end of that phone. She’s probably stressing over the virus and the fact that she’s probably over worked. She didn’t help my situation at all. 

I didn’t have a ton of anxiety today but I have an exam in a few days and the distance thing is getting to me. So I had a bad thought pop in my head just before I was about to go to sleep.

And, as with many people, I had to pack up my life in 36 hrs to get back to my home country before the borders closed during this pandemic, which included throwing away about 80% of my belongings and rehoming my dog.

68,"DISCLAIMER: Whilst I am looking for advice on what to do in my situation, I do not want to be told that “life just gets better” or any other bs slogan. If you do decide to comment, please leave some actual, critical advice. Thank you very much in advance.

Ok, let’s get started.

Ever since grade 4, I have thought about killing myself. I don’t think about cutting myself, or any other self harm, mostly because to me I’d just be inducing more pain into my life. This is what has been stopping me from killing myself too: I knew that it would be painful. Recently, however, I discovered a way to do so very painlessly (I won’t describe how to in order to hopefully stop others like me). At this point I don’t really have much to live for. All I can think about are big world issues (not COVID), such as climate change, ICBM’s being able to be launched, total surveillance (mostly China related concerns). Even though I’m young-ish, I already know that I don’t want kids, mostly because of these issues. 

I’m still in school, and whilst I’m not bullied, I am well known for being a not so nice kid. It’s not that I bully people, I’ve always known where to stop. Instead I’m the kid that thinks he’s better, smarter, more well educated than everyone else. I can’t make friends with guys (Yes, I’m M) because I don’t understand or fit in with masculine culture, and so instead sit with female friends, ones who I get along with but don’t really help me feel more connected, mostly because I don’t understand the idea of social bs, and not telling people what I think of them.

To summarise the above paragraphs: I have friends, but I don’t see the point. I think about my future alot, and don’t see the point. I want to kill myself.

At this point the only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I know that I am going to hurt people by doing this, mostly my mother (my sister and father are both pieces of shit). I don’t have social connections strong enough for people to care for longer than a couple weeks. I don’t get the idea of living to adulthood, because all I can think about is how am I going to fit in or get along with people.

As I said in my disclaimer: please don’t answer with some bs about how it gets better, or how much people care. They genuinely don’t, outside some close family and friends (maybe 10, tops). I really need any other reason to live rn.

Thank you, and apologies for the lack of structure and the repetition in this post.",12Apr2020,2

I was struggling with bulimia and self harm a lot then and as a minor I talked a lot to her about both. I told her about my bulimia and how I was constantly making myself throw up and she never wanted to help me with it and whenever I'd bring it up she'd ask if I was throwing up and when I said no she'd dismiss it. She also never told my parents since they didn't know and I realize in hindsight she probably should have for my own safety.

But what really messed me up was she made a lot of comments about how I was the most extreme case they'd ever had (her and the head pyschologist also insisted I only had mild self esteem issues when I'd been previously diagnosed with two anxiety disorders and depression and I was showing all the symptoms of bpd and my family doctor thought I had bpd which it turns out I was later diagnosed with it as an adult) which was why they extended my therapy from three months to a year which they'd never done before and when she was referring me to a group therapy program she made a HUGE point of telling me how everyone else there had been cutting for so much longer then me and had attempted suicide way more times and had been hospitalized and I was lucky to get in because they were sicker then me and nobody got in unless they were as sick as them but because I was such an extreme case I got in.

I was constantly referred to as an extreme case and being extremely mentally ill which really messed me up and lead to me developing an EXTREME paranoia where I felt like everyone viewed me as being an extreme case and I had to keep hurting myself constantly to live up to those standards. It got to the point where all I could think about all day everyday was huting myself and getting more sicker and I would go to bed crying worrying I hadn't hurt myself enough.

I'm realizing in hindsight a lot of what she said wasn't appropriate and I'm so thankful I have a good therapist now who knows about all this and doesn't refer to me as being extremely ill or mildly ill. I was already sick before but being constantly told I was one of the most extreme cases ever led me to an intense paranoia where I again tried to end my own life and made my self harming behaviors ten times worse then they already were. I know she didn't mean any harm and I don't blame her for my own actions but at the same time I've realized what she said was just not appropriate.",12Apr2020,4

72,"m not depressed about myself, im depressed with a seemingly pointless existence. like at the end of the day nothing matters, some people find that freeing to me thats scary as hell. one of the other things that scares me is the idea of peak creativity. let me give you some context, im a ""musician"" which is kind of a word id use to describe somebody who can play pretty much anything but averagely, sort of a jack of all trades master of none situation (again im not depress ed about myself this is just a backstory). my problem is that after 100 or soo years of contemporary popular music with the body of work of ll the collectiv artists that at some point every or melody will have been thought of. theres only 12 notes in the western scale and if you take the word understanding which has 12 letters theres only so many words you can make out of that. now as a musician and an audio engineer whos whole life was music ive had a hard time being able to listen to music even old music as it seems like everyones always just copying somebody else, hell katy perry got sued for using a common descending minor melody and had to pay up to some nobody. this has translated across to movies and comedy because nowdays all we see is reboot after reboot and even some original movies seem just likea another movie in a different package. also with standup comedy i was watching a special on netflix where one of the jokes was about masturbation and it was one that id heard before, at least a loose interpretation of another comedians joke. now i look upon the world and i cant not see the seemingly meaningless environment we live in where everything is just a repeat of something that has already been done and it literally keeps me up at night in a cold sweat. like we as a species have done it all and with the ever increasing nature of ai into our lifes (this has already had an impact on the audio engineering industry) humans are kind of coming to an obsolesces in a way.",12Apr2020,1
73,"So I'm in the worst state I've ever been in and am extremely suicidal. However, the annoying thing is that even when I'm in that state of dissociation that happens when you're about to make an attempt, I can control myself to not do anything purely because I know the effects the even an attempt can have on other people and I couldn't do that to my best friends (who are like family to me). Despite this control, the suicidal thoughts have been getting worse and worse over time and more difficult to reason with and now it's been over a week where my first thought every morning is about killing myself.

74,"A little bit about me, and some context behind my life:

I'm 17, I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. 

My parents, whom I live with, frequently fight with one another and it always makes me feel devasted and distressed. I have told them before about how I feel about their fights, but they didn't care nor did anything to try and solve their problems

I also feel like I can't turn to them for emotional support because of their emotionally neglectful ways of parenting, and they don't even have their own shit together so I don't think they can help me out. 

I have no true friends whom I can turn to for emotional support, mainly because I have social anxiety (haven't got it diagnosed, I know you aren't supposed to self-diagnose, but I find myself ticking all the boxes of social anxiety).

My school is starting soon and I have no doubt that I would be stressed the f out from all the school work, and presentations on top of my crippling social anxiety, loneliness, and depression. And I'm worried that because I have no emotional support, and if my parents were to fight again, which is highly likely, it would just destroy me. 

What can I do on a personal level to keep myself sane amidst all these shit? 

Also, I have been on free counselling at my school for months now but I still feel like nothing has changed. I have booked an appointment for therapy at the start of this year at my national mental health institute (which is the cheapest option I can afford), but have been told that the earliest date I can get therapy is at mid-May. So there's that.",12Apr2020,1

I've been dealing with anxiety my whole life, and it's been getting really bad ever since covid 19 hit my state. Seeing political posts on Reddit is not helping. Yesterday I had a panic attack because I feel so lost. I'm really scared for my country and family. Ive always classified myself as pretty left leaning, but now I don't know who or what to trust. It seems like no matter what, everything's getting worse. Maybe it's the bias posts on Reddit, but I dont remember the last time I saw some good news, other than random people surviving the virus. Am I overreacting? Are media outlets exaggerating? Should I just stop caring and stay out of politics? Or should I just keep staying informed, even if it's effecting my mental state.

85,"Since birth, I was never really appreciated or loved by  anyone else other than my closed ones, what I mean is that I was hated or perceived as a despicable human being by pretty much everyone that knows me.

Here's my story.

I was raised in a boarder line falling apart family, dad too busy and mom has severe mental health and physical health issue (depression and other surgery). So I was sent to live with family friends for 2 years between the age of 4-6 due to my mom's conditions. She later admitted that she wanted to kill herself and bring me along with her. I remembered one time I misbehaved, I was around 4, she threatened me by saying that she's gonna jump off the building because she believed that I didn't love her. 

In school, I am always being treated as the freak, creep, ugly, idiot, and fag by pretty much everyone, ""friends"" included. This is always a part of my life, even now. I guess I am just cursed and nothing really changes in the end.

I was bullied severely and nobody helped me. I reached out for authority but they blamed everything on me because bullies have more friends. One time, two teens physically bullied me severely and I kicked them back. The institution informed my mom and she doesn't let me explain so she blamed me, I was 8 or 7. She then fake abandoned me for a night and I was picked up by my busy father. When I misbehaved, she punish me by taking away things that I love, so I am scared of her for most part of my family life. I think that authority or anyone else will never help me because they didn't. I was always punished for mistakes that I was forced or didn't commit. 

I also don't believe that people will help me because I learned that people are heartless toward me in my darkest year. I was the target of everything and everyone, I was not someone's enemy but I was the arch enemy, the only foe. I am still kinda of that person now but there's less people messing around with me now since everyone is busy.

Everytime I got hurt, I don't tell anyone or rarely cry in front of people, even my family. My mother always tell me that I never deserved to cry because my family provides me with organic foods, good educations, and attentions. So I cry alone since I know that other will kick me while I am down and my closed ones think that I am just being weak when they saw my tears. 

Overall, I don't trust anyone and I think everyone is going to hurt me in someway that I don't expect, so I grew more and more paranoid. I was always harmed when communicating with others, they always end up making fun or straight up assaulting me.

I also don't know if I am depressed or not because I did have many suicidal and self harming thoughts. However, it doesn't effect my function as a person that much because I have been feeling this way since birth. 

I have felt short lived happiness in my life, it was a simple but warm feeling. So I have decided to feel happy again. The biggest problem is that people still hate me, and they always mess with me for entertainment. I was listening to music on the discord server today in a separate chat, but I still got kicked out since my existence is offensive. Despite not disturbing anyone, I was wrong fundamentally. 

I really tried to be a nice person and start to be positive about everything. But I will always end up being a tool or being attacked. Now, that kindness is fading away from my head and I can only feel my violent desire. It's taking over my mind bit by bit and I am on the edge of breaking apart. I really tried to be a friendly but I do know that the only way to stop everyone from hurting me is to hurt them. I know that because I tried. Now, that bad desire is tempting me and I don't know what to do anymore since it is very effective at making hurting stop. 

Please don't hate anyone or my mother. She loves me and she is the only person that gives me any sort of love or support, so I love her and I know that she's trying her best to help me. For the people that hate me, I believe that they are nice people of some sort because they do seem to be friendly to anyone else  and a lot of them are willing to help others. I just don't know why nice people are not being nice to me and I really just want to make people stop attacking me. 

I am so lost and I don't know how to feel about myself and everyone else. I am now so tired of living in constant paranoia and being so defensive but aggressive at the same time. I just want to be kind and to be loved like everyone else. I just want to enjoy life and stop conflicting with everyone.",12Apr2020,2
86,"For context, I am currently 19 (male) and the oldest guy of my siblings (I'm child 3/5).

When I was younger (around the age of 7-15), my dad used to try rough housing with me (because it's apparently a thing guys are supposed to do?), Or chase my older sisters and I around with a weaponized towel, despite all of my protests and attempts to fight him off/escape, or even calling for my mother to get him to stop (very seldom worked), and he would always pin me to the ground and say that I would have to push him off (like how is a 7yo supposed to do that?). Now, if I see even a hint of movement in my direction, whether it's innocent or not, I flinch, recoil, and throw my hands up in front of me to stop whatever it coming my way. Sometimes my dad makes fun of me, especially when we're in the car together (when he's driving) and he'll just randomly make sudden quick movements like moving his arm straight up or towards me stopping just before hitting my chest, and he seems to think it's funny. But now it's gotten even worse to where if I THINK I see movement, even if it's in the corner of my eye or nothing is there, I physically recoil and put my arms up like I'm defending against being hit or something. I don't think my parents physically abused me, but I wonder if I developed some form of PTSD/some other problem because of it?

88,"Okay, so, idk how to start this, but hey, my name's Andrés, and I am from Colombia.. And I think I need help.
Basically for what I think it's 3 years now, I constantly feel worthless, like life doesn't matter, that I am a waste of time and resources,  it started as a minor thought, but now, it''s almost daily. 
Let me tell you all the story.
So I've never been good looking, nor i've been the best at school, nor did I have the opportunity to have a present father with me (he ""abandoned"" us), gay with a very closed minded family...to sum it all up, my self steem is very low.
Being the only child with a single mother on a small town... It sucks... U can't have personal space unless you bottle everything up, which I did.
It all started in 10th grade, our highschool  actually, was the worse school someone could have. Literally no one had the right to express themselves nor have some kind of choice when it comes to religion. My school was a private catholic school, which I guess they had the right, but man, that's not good for anyone. Anyway as of 10th grade I have not been thinking the best of me. I started lossing motivation, to get lazy, my sleeping schedules were horrible, and I've never had good eating habits. But I didn't paid a lot of attention and kept on going with those things for a whole year, until my senior year in highschool, when a lot of pressure was building on me because *college* 
Here in Colombia, I believe colleges work a bit different than US or international colleges. So basically we have 2 kinds of college, public and private. Private is for people who have money and can go and pay their fee and that's it, public college, however it's complicated, u have to take a test (which is not easy) to pass to the career u want. If u don't cut it, then you out, is that simple. I wanted to do my major in a career called ""engeneering of digital entertainment design"" which is only found in one of the private colleges of Colombia, and obviously we couldn't afford it. So I had to take the risk and jump to take one of the tests of the public colleges from Colombia, in a career i didn't want (or at least not as much, systems engineering) but i didn't make the cut for it, and my family obligated me to pick a career that I did not want to because it had ""engeering"" on the name.
The moment I staryed college (1 year ago) I felt... Hopeless... Like, it doesn't matter if I try nothing would come out as I want, I dropped out of college asap and my family was utterly dissapointed on me, and from then on, my mind is in a constant state ofnot being motivated. Feeling depressed. Acrually crying myself to sleep sometimes, feeling worthless, like, a lot of times I wonder if life it's better without me and my conclusion is always yes... Idk what to do. I can't afford to go a therapist nor I want to worry my family (which my relationship with them is one of the worsts), I am thinking of actually dissapear. Like. Leave no traces behind... And just dying alone in a hole because of how worthless I am...

91,"I am currently trying to figure out if I have BPD. Although, I have many times where I think mental illness is fake and just made by the psych community and pharmaceutical company to make us take pills to poison us and make us weak just because we're different. I have been self harming for a while but did have a 2 year gap where I stopped. Then as things got bad in my life again and I hated the situation where I haven't been able to accomplish my goals it makes me just want to punish myself. I also do it sometimes now when I'm really anxious. It alleviates the anxiety. I am also currently trying to get my file from my therapists office to see what diagnosis they gave me. I remember reading schizoaffective on the notes but I may have misread I don't know. I definitely do not believe I have that or have bipolar disorder either. 

Everyone keeps trying to convince me these things but I have been good. Except for the fact that I'm dying from sleep deprivation right now I can't sleep and have bad panic attacks. The sleep has nothing to do with the anxiety. It just has to do with the fact that I can't sleep and I keep getting dizzy and yeah I think I'm gonna die. Anyway, sorry for ranting. I think one time I wanted to commit suicide was because of a person but at the same time I think I had some kind of enlightenment and realized that I'm the problem for everyone. It was impulsive. I do not remember if I was depressed days before that. But I know I wrote a suicide letter that morning and went to drive to the bridge. I never ended up attempting it though. I was more contemplating it instead. I've had other times where I've contemplated it which was not due to this and went to the same place.

 How do I tell my therapist and how do I ask her what my diagnosis are? Can she tell me over the phone? We're doing telehealth right now. I guess I should be proud of myself for thinking this way because for a long time I've believed and still do I think that mental illness is corroborated by higher people that want to hurt us middle class or lower class citizens. Also, a lot of people told me I was in denial or that I am lacking some kind of insight. I hope I'm making sense. I'm literally typing this while having anxiety because of no sleep, dizziness, and other symtpoms. I hope I don't die soon from sleep deprivation. It might have been going on a week or two now.

I definitely do not have mania or hypomania or depression. I do not have bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder. I don't hallucinate all the time or everyday. Right now it's just anxiety, sleeping issues, and anger as well as irritability which is probably from lack of sleep. It's horrible to be sleep deprived on your birthday. :(",12Apr2020,3

A year or so ago I tried to eat more. Still no result and now I can’t tell when I’m actually hungry or just the fat twat inside me wanting to be a pig. Days swing between eating well, over eating or pretty much nothing. It’s really contributed to my horrible mental health and mood swings.

102," So the reason i’m posting this in this sub reddit is because i’m looking for a point of view that is looking at this situation with a rational mind as i’m still trying to make sense as to what happened.

So i’m a regular college student but as the pandemic hit in mid-March my mom thought it was best for me to move out of the dorm and be back home for the rest of the semester and finish up my classes that had been moved to online. My mom works at a small suburban pediatrics office near our house and has been naturally stressed out considering her daily job is her being with sick children, on top of that since the pandemic had blown up she’s been watching the news 24/7 and it’s been a talking point of every conversation that she has had.

To give more background she is knowns to have serious anger issues as there will be days were she seems regularly happy and she can be outraged and hysterical to the point being violent to her two sons and husband, all of us recognize that this behavior is not and should be treated as normal.

Yesterday when she had come back from home she had been visibly upset about something at work and normally when this happens she will begin screaming at me and brother about an issue in the house that may or may not have done that is an easy fix (ex. doing the dishes, sweeping , basic chores). Trying to stop a confrontation i immediately go to make sure the house is in order before going back to my room, while in there i hear her screaming at my brother from outside the hallway and go to check what’s going on, I made the mistake of being a smart ass in the moment and simply telling my brother that he’s talking to a brick wall which my mom would describe as one of her triggers. 

Around 15 minutes later me and my brother are having an unrelated conversation in my room and she barges in and brings up why i haven’t found a new job (the new job that i had found had temporarily closed down due to the pandemic which i had explained to her days before hand) What had confused me the most about this is that we had a conversation about working less then 24 hours beforehand and she felt that she didn’t want me to even be working in the first place due to us being in the midst of a global pandemic but when i had brought that up she said she didn’t remember any sort of conversation like that. It was about to form into a full fledged argument and i brought up that she was already bothered by something at work before coming back and instead of taking out your frustration on your kids like you usually do can we just have a conversation about what happened, to which she had walked off to.

Around 10 minutes after my brother had come back from getting groceries i hear crying and screaming coming from the kitchen and walk on to the scene of my mother being hysterical to my brother and talking about how she scared about if she has Coronavirus or not and that no one in the house cares about her. Upon hearing this me and my brother realize that she’s having a panic attack and spent time trying to calm her down, she mentions how me and my brother are going to be the death of her and how we never cared about her and when she dies we are going to be driven insane, me and my brother are just trying to calm her down and get her to go lay down and rest since she believes she has a fatal disease and she says that it’s to late for that as we should of already cared this much before hand and she starts cooking dinner. Me and my brother at this point are just trying to convince her that we do care and love her and that she should go rest but she just keeps crying screaming and cursing us out.

This frustrates my brother to the point of suggesting that she doesn’t actually think that she has corona as she would of went and rested and not tried to cook dinner and basically suggests that my mom is just being emotional manipulative at this point this erupts into a screaming match we’re my mom says very malicious things to us and brought her to the point of trying to fight both me and my brother, she then seems to have snapped out of crying and is enraged with us telling us that we will no longer be able to live at our house together and that she’s taking her car back from me and that she’s not going to help with my schooling anymore. I go on to decide that i’m just going to call her husband who’s at work so that i can have some clue on how to handle this to which i found out she had texted him “i’m scared” followed by cursing him out over text.

The next however remaining hours of the afternoon and evening were followed by screaming on her part at every other person in the family and I had simply decided to go and crash at a friends. I’m still trying to make sense of what happened and I’m not experienced enough on the matter to call my mother mentally ill or scapegoat her saying that all of it is her fault, I guess i’m just looking for someone’s take on this outside of friends and family I’m willing to answer any questions on the matter as this is most likely a very confusing and poor view of what happened to some people.",12Apr2020,1
103,"Grew up sad and depressed, went through numerous anti depressants and hospitalizations, didn't have a close family or any close enough friends.  Mother was very emotional and dad was distant and agressive.. (Didn't really know how to be close to anyone, scared of intimacy) Have a weird relationship with myself. During childhood and teenage years I was alone a lot and it felt like I was my only friend in some ways, but at the same time I hated myself. I don't know where my beliefs about myself begin or end and my mind is so far from myself it seems like I can't grasp onto anything inside myself. I know my family has always treated me a specific way and are assholes about it, but they are my family and feel as if they have done nothing wrong, because it is the past and even i have forgotten. I feel like they never taught me anything just left me to wonder why the world doesn't deserve me. I don't know how I feel or why I feel or why it matters. I know I have many limits and negative beliefs especially about myself but I don't know where to begin or how to begin at all, everytime I try to think about myself I just get really depressed and shameful and hopeless about ever fixing it, and I can't stop crying. I can't ever remember the important specific moments in my past that changed my mind about myself based on what I interpreted, but all I remember is crying most of the time and just feeling really incredibly shitty, usually specifically about myself.  I want to say that all of my issues stem from problems with myself.
Now I am almost 21 and I have much more of an objectice understanding of the whole thing, I have been trying to forgive people of my past from my own misunderstandings and interpretations. But when it comes to me and myself is where I always hit a road block, I can't figure anything out. It seems like I purposely blocked what I did out of my mind. I was a shitty teenager for sure, stealing and doing drugs and not caring about anyone; now I realize I just didn't understand life back then. It's like I have never had a relationship with myself and I am just more confused about me than I ever was. Its like my subjective understanding, my first hand perspective that is my problem. I have always been very bad at communicating and  I don't understand any of this
If anybody gets what I am trying to say please give me some advice. I've looked up so many terms, so many roadblocks.",12Apr2020,1
104,"I'm a 26 years old guy and I've been staying with all of my extended family in a family home. I've always had a toxic relationship with my mother. She was very abusive to me and my siblings growing up.
Some honest to god examples:
-pulling out a knife on us.
-Yelling ""We're Muslims and if I killed you I don't face the death penalty because I'm your mother""
-Getting my 8 years old sister to clean the entire kitchen with her bare hands because 'She messed it up"" baking cookies. Needless to say my sister abandoned what was a blossoming hobby.
-Rubbing peppers on my 6 years old brother's lipe and yelling at the rest of us while he cries ""whoever gives him milk or water will get peppers on their lips too""

Now I was always the one standing up to her, but she always used religious ""honor your parents crap"" to turn the siblings against me even after I stop her from abusing them. I came to terms with that.

Women didn't drive in Saudi Arabia when I was in highschool, and my father worked until 6pm before visiting his parents because of the ""honor your parents"" doctrine. This left me running the day to day aspects of the house. And it really showed me how insecure my mother is about her intelligence. Becoming effectively my boss, she couldn't remember all she needed when she sent me to the grocery. She'd flip and blame me when I don't bring something she forgot to ask for. She was clueless about  basic things like booking an appointment at a hospital, business hours of certain shops. She also had no ability to draw up timelines. She'd expect you to make 2 half hour trips in 20 minutes, neglecting the time you'll spend at a facility every time, etc.

Over time I began using her intelligence insecurity to abuse her. My entire family is made of Doctors, engineers, and research scientists. My father was also a professor, while she administered a small government office. I would always fight back when she blames others for her mistakes or throws tantrums by telling her she's childish, blind to her flaws, and narcissistic.

With her kids having all left home, she turned her abuse to maids.

She was yelling at them for one of her mistakes today, and I said ""have compassion for the people working under you"".
She flipped and began yelling that I know nothing about managing people and that she manages over 50 women at her office.

Now she may have been right, I'm a chemist and never had any interest in management, but I responded back by telling her she couldn't manage sending a highschooler to the grocery store and that her office is a joke. She called me a pervert for standing up to the maids and that I was a low life scum.

I responded by telling her she revealed her trashy mindset. And that the reason all of her kids moved to far away cities as soon as they could and are now actively avoiding visiting home is her.

I feel red rage after such incidents, and I have no idea what to do. My father says I should just ignore her, but how can you ignore someone abusing people so much? It's not a matter of her yelling at me, she's making everyone miserable. You can't just turn a blind eye to things like the examples I already gave.

I have so much rage and frustration towards her, I've repeatedly told my father he should divorce her if he cares about his kids and grandkids. That's how dysfunctional our mother-son dynamic is.

What the f**k am I supposed to do?",12Apr2020,1
105,"What's the point of surviving when no one bothers about your existence ? People say live for yourself,it gets better with time but no it doesn't. 

I've literally no one to call as my own.No friends,no relatives,no relationship. My parents hate me and are just ready to get rid of me anyhow.Just consider me as burden because a single person of my age is nothing more. But growing up in a dysfunctional toxic family lead to so many trust and commitment issues.Scared of attachment and don't want get married or into any relationship because don't want someone neither will I het anyone who'll bear with my mood swings,my depression,my complete lack of emotional control.

I keep pushing people away because scared that they'll hurt me leave me,got rejection and abandonment issues. Several times I find myself searching for 100% sure ways of ending my life because ""what if I survive"" then everyone will hate me more, everyone just hates me without any reason.No one understands me.My so-called family and friends will be ashamed and people will call be psycho attention seeker.But above all what if I just survive but somehow physically challenged then it'll no less than a nightmare.

It's not like anyone will be bothered if I die.I am that friend who's always remembered when they need something but never called for any outing,who's always left behind while walking or in conversation. With my  childhood experience of hatred,bitterness and getting beaten at home along with that getting bullied at school and college severely damaged my mental health. 

I hate talking to anyone scared that they'll just use me, scared of relationship as no one can tolerate my hot and cold behavior  plus people these days just want you or physical needs. I am too scared to get my leftover sanity and heart broken.My sibling hates me.Just wants to push me out of house and prove me to be a loser and  wrong one in front of my parents. They all had beaten me so much in my childhood but still I care for them beautiful I have no one.My relatives and cousins hate us.Seen my father,sibling and heard of my grandfather cheating on their spouse. So but hate marriage and relationships more. 

During childhood two house staffs used to molest me, I was just 8-9 years old.One of my cousin was no less.Sometimes I feel that may be somehow I was responsible for it. Now I hate when people touch me. In school I used to be  badly bullied and humiliated. Never had anyone to help me or understand me even a bit. My mother sometimes getting manic tried to kill me.

Sometimes I crave of affection but then I push people away because I'm fucking scared. No one ever hugged me,I want to hug someone and see how it feels. Never played with teddy bears in childhood,just want to get one for myself. Never did anything which a person of my age does. Always tried to be a good girl, trying to appease my parents, always helping others even if they hurt me, no thought ill about anyone,never intentionally hurted anyone,never demanded anything for myself,always listen to others.

I don't want money,riches or anything.Just a small happy family, a protective sibling not a selfish one who won't leave their sister in front of wolves to fend for herself.Want a caring partner who'll understand,love and care and above all respect me,with respect comes loyalty.Some who can love me which I never got in my life. Even after everything I till love my parents and their codependency,obsessive helicopter parenting has ruined me badly.They are aged now don't know how will I survive all alone in this big bad world. Can't marry which they want because again don't want to be a liability on anyone. Want to live independently on my on terms. But think that's too good to be true.

Now after 27 years of struggling with all these I'm just tired.Guess my problems are never ending and now I'm high on my manic mode so sharing so much publicly and will regret when I'm normal.Guess ending myself will only end my problems.Sorry for my long rant.",12Apr2020,1

108,"Hi so I’m (19F), 

So for about a year now my friends have noticed that once I’m happy I’m extremely happy and it’s uncontrollable and I have a very high self confidence which is very rare for me as I have extremely low self esteem and I seem to just have a lot more energy then usual and I get super motivated about work or some other project and this will all come out of nowhere. This will usually last a few days to a week but no longer then that, and then my mood will drop completely all of a sudden and I become extremely depressed and my self esteem will drop even lower, become suicidal at times etc etc don’t wanna go into detail. this state will usually last 2-3 weeks... I assumed it was normal until my friends started to point out that I didn’t have a very good balance with my emotions and it’s not normal to either be extremely energetic or extremely depressed and not have a emotion in between the two. I’m not trying to self diagnose myself as I know how hard bipolar can be for people with it, but I am starting to question it because I’m unsure what else describes these weeks of uncontrollable extreme emotions. I would go to the doctors but I want to go in with some idea of what maybe is happening with me :) (also I have a history of social anxiety)",12Apr2020,1

Maybe its because everything is less noisy and annoying to pass by, maybe its the free taxies to work  and sometimes empty transportation.

 Maybe it's because i don't need to worry about fake smiles and human interaction as much.
Maybe seeing people panic about things makes me feel more energetic somehow

111,"Hello everyone,

First of all I hope everyone is coping as best they can during these challenging times, and most importantly don't be afraid to reach out to your friends and family even if it's just for a chat. Remember that we're all going through this together. 

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, so if it's not maybe someone could point me towards somewhere else! And sorry in advance for the long post, I'll try my best to explain the situation as concisely as possible. 

Anyway, my sister has struggled with a lot of mental health issues for many years now (she's 29 now and got diagnosed with bipolar disorder sometime during her early teens). She's seen countless psychologist and psychiatrists who have given her countless diagnoses (aspergers, depression, anxiety, the list goes on). She's been put on so many different medications I think it would be impossible to count and none of them have ever worked. When she was around 19 or 20, she rapidly gained lots of weight (due to being prescribed HEAPS of new medication) and she has never lost it since. She was always very fit, active, and healthy before that. She's been in and out of uni since she finished high school and still hasn't graduated. She is incredibly smart but just doesn't apply herself (or know how to). She will go through good spells and bad spell (months at a time) so she always ends up spiraling out of control and needing to take a semester off. In the past year or so, she's been into the hospital twice for 2-3 week periods in order to take her off certain medications. I thought this would be good for her and that maybe she might be finally starting to move forward. 

I've been studying at uni overseas for the past few years and just got back a few weeks ago (a couple months earlier than anticipated because of the whole COVID-19 situation). I'm back now living with my parents and sister while I look for a job, and she seems to be doing worse than ever. I'm 6 years younger than her so I've been out of the loop for a lot of this, but now that I'm older I feel like it's my responsibility to help. As stated earlier, I was under the impression that her medication is being reduced but I have just found out that that is not the case at all. She is being prescribed Largactil (chlorpromazine), Duloxetine, Topiramate, Sodium valproate, and Propanalol Hydrochloride. She is so quiet, doesn't speak unless spoken to, and even then it's either no response or a word or two if we're lucky. Both my parents are working from home right now so we all eat lunch and dinner together as a family. She'll get up for meals because we force her to but then she'll just go straight back to bed. We try to get her to stay up, go for walks, even just go outside and sit in the sun for 5 minutes but she just won't do it! She barely even drinks water unless my mum tells her to. It kills me to see her like this. She's never been like this in her life. I feel like she's her own worst enemy at times. 

I guess one of my questions is, does anyone have any experience with these drugs? It seems excessive to me especially since she's never had a positive reaction to any of the medications she's been prescribed before. She also insists on taking more than she is prescribed on the packet (my mum keeps them and gives them to her in the morning and night, but my sister claims that the doctor has told her to take 2 tablets instead of one, for example). So I am wondering if maybe these drugs have the potential for abuse? And that she might be wanting to take more for a ""good feeling"", like recreational use?

The way my parents and I see it, she started going downhill badly after she started being prescribed lots of drugs and put on all that weight. She has never been healthy since. I feel like one of the most important things for good mental health is to be physically healthy as well. I'm not saying you have to be a 5-start athlete but you should at least eat healthy, stay hydrated, and do some kind of exercise daily. I know I feel like shit mentally if I don't exercise everyday. I also think the weight gain has contributed to her lack of confidence and anxiety issues. 

Does anyone have any advice for us so that we can help her? Maybe you or someone you know has struggled with similar circumstances? We are always trying to be as supportive and as encouraging as possible, we just want to see her succeed and live a happy life. 

Sorry again for the long post and being a bit all over the place, I'm not really sure what I'm looking for but any advice at all would be greatly appreciate! Stay safe everyone.",12Apr2020,1

113,"I ended up in the hospital in March for a depressive episode, and they believed I might have bipolar based on information from previous therapists and psychiatry appointments. I was put on Seroquel, felt better, and they released me. But I had a few questions about that diagnosis. 

So I've suffered from hallucinations since I was younger (around middle school age, I'm 18 now) and they are ongoing, almost daily occurances. I have auditory, visual, and tactile hallucinations, many of which are recurring. I only have delusions during episodes and they involve believing I'm being spied on, people are going to steal my things, or hurt me. But the hallucination are all the time, even when I'm not in an episode. 

I stopped taking my medicine recently due to a bout of paranoia (I thought I was being drugged, I was triggered by vivid nightmares caused by one of my medications and threw all of them out in a panic) and it triggered an episode of mania. My hallucinations have gotten worse, but they are almost constant most of the time anyway. My medication is being upped by 100mg to handle paranoia, but I don't know how that will combat the paranoia I get from my hallucinations. They aren't scary to me per say, but they bother me with delusions and try to change my thinking. I dunno, it's weird to talk about.  I'm not schizophrenic as far as I'm aware, but I have ongoing psychosis and a mood disorder, which sounds like a dead ringer for schizoaffective. Could it be something else?

Sorry if there are any mistakes in my writing, English is not my first language.I don't really know much about mental health, so if I'm wrong about something please let me know. 

So first, I need to tell you about the story behind the problem: I'll try to cut it short so I don't bore you, but here it is: 

I'm a 17 year old female, who had a year long relationship that ended about 7 months ago, so I was 16 when it happened. I was very naive so I had sexual relations with the guy a lot, and most of the time it was unprotected, so when I missed my period, the stress began. I live in a country where teen pregnancy is not at all accepted, my parents are also very strict, and my boyfriend was not the ideal type. So I took a test and it was positive. I was 16 and pregnant. I didn't know what to do, I went home and told my mom, I knew I had to. She screamed at me, and told my father, who didn't speak to me for two months after, but it wasn't as bad as I expected. They booked an appointment for an abortion the following week, and made me go to school in the meantime. I was desperate. I knew it would be best to abort because I am young and I wouldn't be able to give the baby the life it should have, and also I didn't want anyone to know what happened to me. So I did it. I cried for two weeks without stopping, it was horrible. I feel a lot of regret. But I thought it was done, that the pain went away. But then I shut down, I didn't feel anything. I broke up with my boyfriend, because I had zero feelings left for him, even though before this I was madly in love with him. Now, I'm in a different relationship that is three months long, and I'm starting to regret it. I had feelings for him at fisrt but now, nothing. Also, I have problems with concentrating, anger, panic attacks, I also have problems with eating, I feel like I don't belong anywhere and like there is no future for me. I have been feeling like shit for 7 months, but today I researched about PTSD for the fisrt time, and I feel like I have most of the symptoms. Is it possible to get PDST because of this?",12Apr2020,2

120,"So ever since I was a kid I easily got lost in my daydreams easily

I used to go to school pretend I was listening and day Dream about my cartoon shows what would happen and also enter myself in the story its like  I had a TV in my head

I easily woke up when we had to write something or to when someone says my name but after that I easily fell back to daydreaming even sometimes in school I wrote automatically without paying attention even when the teacher was telling us what to write

Also at recess i spent my time alone from other kids( I'm highly introverted so I mostly prefer to be alone) walking in the playground and daydreaming


The only time I was awake was when I was doing something more entertaining like watching TV or playing video games

Well years passed and I barely finished highschool ( although  I rarely focused in class except with some fun teachers (mostly my history teacher he used to describe history in a fun way  also I had a math and physics home tutar because it was one on one I didn't daydream too much) (the rest of the stuff I crammed at  home on my own which was hard because I kept daydreaming in between)

And even at collage I still daydream the same way


Well the problem is recently I realized that I don't control what I daydream completely it depends on shows anime's and books I read

And lately Ive been daydreaming about sad scenarios like betrayel death being framed for a crime I didn't commit

Also loosing my girlfriend ( which is funny because I don't have one)

And although I know these senerios are fake It emotionally feels real so I'm emotionally down allot of time

I tried looking for other shows with a happy tune so that I can feel better but I still daydream about sad stuff allot even if less than before






What I want to ask is daydreaming excessively a medical condition? what is it and what should I do?


Also I'm a collage student in a third world country in a small town with a not so understanding father (who has a little bit of anger issues) and haven't told him or anyone about this (but they all kind of already know because as I said I daydream a lot)  so therapy is out of the question until  I graduate get a job and move away which will take sometime.",12Apr2020,0

132,"Hey there folks!


For the information of the post, I'm a major germaphobe. I absolutely do not like to be touched by anybody


It's absolutely damaging to my mental health. I've also had a history of being slapped by my dad as a child.


Everytime, he or anyone else for that matter, even raise their hands at me, I flinch and get scared.

So with him touching me, my germaphobia compounds on top of it as well


I also have this weird issue where I damn near blackout each time I stand up, or even raise my back when I'm sitting on a bed.


My dad knows this, continues to make fun of me for it and claims ""I'M 50 and I'm not tired. Why are you so tired?""

Anyway, I'm heading on the wrong track for this post, so I'll get back to the topic at hand.



If I don't come as fast as I'm told, my dad raises his hand and comes forward to touch me. Half the time I'm on my bed. 


I can not rise up quickly enough, lest I near-blackout again, so I plead and beg him to wait and to not do that. 


He doesn't relent. He just tries heading straight towards me to touch me. Keep in mind rooms here are small. I can't walk by fast enough. 



I woke up one day to him threatening to touch me to get me out of bed, and at one point even raising a filled fabric pouch filled with stationary and pencils, and threatening to throw it at me. 


Today, he scratched his chest in front me, and tried to touch me. I managed to walk past him, to the place where he wanted me to go in the first place. He doesn't give up. He again walks a couple meters behind me with his arm out stretched. 




He also has a habit of coughing into the air. If I tell him to cover his mouth, he coughs onto me purposefully.

142,"I just got my shit together after going through treatment a bunch. Once COVID is over, I'll have a job that covers three times the rent. There are a few problems:

- My boyfriend is also mentally ill, works through vocational rehab and cannot work full time
- I had some incidents with landlords. No evictions or late payments, but I broke the lease at the end of one lease
- I accidentally sublet illegally and upon finding out, I left immediately. Because I applied for food stamps there, that address shows up on my history and I must explain why I was there for a month and a half before moving across the country. This was less than a year ago.
- I have high credit card utilization due to the poverty I was in
- I don't keep jobs for long, and everywhere here requires that you have been with the same employer for 2-3 years.

To make matters worse, I won't have a cosigner to balance the credit and poor rental history. Most landlords and property managers want each person over 18 to qualify separately- that means even if I make $100k, we will be denied if my boyfriend, individually and alone, doesn't make 3x the rent.

I got my shit together, but can't erase my recent history.  I've only had it together since August. Are there organizations that can vouch for people like us who have very bad history but can now pay and be good tenants? A group home wouldn't be appropriate for us, and we were told that the Section 8 and 811 waitlists are long enough to not help us when our lease is up in 6 months",12Apr2020,1

I've used a sleep recorder app and found that I whimper in my sleep on a nightly basis and because of my pillows being on the floor when I wake up, I can tell that I roll around a lot too.

Or I just forget I exist. That's why I'm scared of my reflection.

I view in a camera perspective and don't think about foods at all except sweets. I don't like sweet things but it's like a drug to me, that I can't stop eating.

This year, I went through some traumatizing things that caused me to struggle a lot with my mental health. Luckily, I'm pretty sure I'm over the hump by now and have accepted that things are getting better and that I'll be happy again someday soon. However, during my recovery, I things keep happening to me that make me feel like I'm going crazy and I don't know if I should seek more professional help or if this is part of the healing process and will go away as my mental health improves. Recently, I notice that I keep thinking that I'm losing things and then finding them in places that I've already looked. This happened once with a favourite sweater that was hanging in my closet; I wanted to wear it but I didn't see it when I searched for it. I looked around the house and then came back to my closet and looked more meticulously (I could swear that I looked at what was hanged on each individual hanger in my closet) and didn't find it. It wasn't until I looked in my closet a third time that I saw it hanging normally as it should. I'm highly doubt that anyone would have taken it in the time I couldn't find it. Also, almost the same thing happened with my house key, which I always keep on a hook in the closet near the front door. I remember pretty vividly looking on each of the five (or so) hooks that I could hang it up on and didn't see it. This happened after the sweater incident and so I was aware of the possibility that I was somehow not seeing it due to my anxiety and pessimism, so I made sure to look meticulously again with a clear head but somehow didn't see it until the next day when it was hanging on one of the hooks. I asked my family if they moved it and they said they didn't. This kind of freaked me out. Also, today, I realized that one of my final exams that I thought I had in a couple weeks is tomorrow. This dumbfounded me because I'm a good student and must have checked so many times when it was so I have absolutely no idea how I thought it was on a different day. Each time that something like this happens to me, I feel like I'm going crazy and it honestly makes me question reality to some extent because these things feel so surreal to me. I used to be such a well put together person with good intuition and these types of things would never get past me. I'd feel a lot better knowing that people who have struggled with mental health in the past experienced things like this and that once I heal more, my mind will stop messing with me like this.",12Apr2020,2

174,"My mom has always been a bit quirky. She used to just watch videos on conspiracy theories and talk about it, etc. and it was always just kind of funny. Like, my mom believes in reptilian ppl and big events that were hoaxes, and so on. Pretty much any theory you can think of. 

However, now, it's to a whole new level. She is now super religious (never been religious up until 1-2 years ago)—which religion is fine, no opinion, really—but it's gotten to a level of insanity. She believes the Earth is flat and in a dome and on pillars, and the coronavirus was created so that they could microchip people so now she's talking about going off the grid (aka selling her house and just...living?). She's a retired veteran (Army ICU nurse) and receives money each month, and she is currently in the process of stopping the money flow, which means she will be receiving no money because she doesn't want them to be able to keep track of her. I'm pretty sure she has no savings, and nothing I can say changes anything. She's convinced the world is ending and all these signs (earthquakes and the virus and possible war) and God is going to protect his followers.

She's talked about having problems sleeping, which she claims is attributed to demons and technology. (Which, by the way, mental illness is caused by demons in your head). 

So, family history: My grandpa (her dad) has Schizophrenia. My cousin (her nephew) has Schizophrenia. No one has diagnosed her or anything, I'm not even sure if this is something she has, but given it's in the family I don't know if this is just late onset or something. She's 50 years old. A few years ago, my stepdad left her? and came back? (I don't remember, this has happened so much) and I finally told her he touched me when I was a child because she was so upset. Anyway, she ended up staying with him regardless, even though he constantly accuses her of cheating (he's been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder). That was a big stressful event for her, and all of this ""crazy"" stuff started a little bit after all of this happened. 

I don't know what to do. I'm an only child. I don't have a father to go to, the man she's married to is insane, and I know if I bring it up to her she'll think it's ridiculous and will refuse to go to the doctor because she thinks modern medicine is fucked. She also has grave's disease; I don't know if that affects anything. As for me, I've struggled with anxiety and depression, but nothing to that extent (and I'm really worried I might end up like her when I'm older, which is another reason I'd like to know if she has it). 

At this point I'm freaking out because she's selling her house with no plans for another place and is talking about getting rid of our two senior cats. One has renal failure and they're declawed and she was recently talking about just ""letting them go into the wild."" they're 16. I would have never expected this and I'm honestly worried she's going insane. 

Thoughts? Is this indicative in any manner of Schizophrenia? Is she just insane, and I'm reading into it too much because of family diseases? 

tldr; My mom has been declining mentally and I'm worried it's late onset Schizophrenia; I don't know what to do.",12Apr2020,2

179,"This is a message for people who don't struggle with mental illnesses.

If you have one, you may recognize yourself in my experience.

I'd love to have feedback, if some of you feel the same thing or not.

Today I decided to explain to my friends on Facebook how I was managing the containment so far, but felt like this could be my first post on Reddit.

So here it is :

It  can be a bit shocking and may upset some of you but I never felt better than since the containment started. You'll wonder why I'm sharing my boring ""story"" here, but I hope you'll take the time to read it carefully, if you want to understand what it's like to live with a mental health condition.(TL ; DR at the end)

All the services, organizations, associations, medical appointments, job searching for which I used to be forced to go are now only accessible via mails, phone calls or videoconference.

I absolutely don't miss the outside. I absolutely don't miss ""the nature"" because even before the containment I never used to go for walks ""in the wild"" as I live in a quite crappy, dirty and sad neighborhood. I hate taking the subway, it mentally exhausts me.

I only go out for groceries and it became a quite exciting thing since the beginning of the containment, as I started cooking a lot of vegetables I never used to cook, cause every time I go to the supermarket, only the ""least popular"" ones are left, so I have to learn ""real"" cooking, follow recipes and eat new ""exotic"" (for me) ones. Same for the meat. Before, my ""cooking world"" was only composed of peppers, tomatoes, carrots and... that's all.

No wonder I got bored and almost stopped eating veggies.

You may think that my story is boring and wonder why I write this, but there actually is a reason : for some people like me (I'm Bipolar Type II with major anxiety problems), or like autistic people (I don't consider myself autistic but it's for the example), the outside world could be an extremely stressful, exhausting, noisy and visually aggressive place.

The containment made me understand that I'm not fit for the outside world, and I should stop trying and trying, and failing all the time fearing that if I cut myself from the outside world I'm gonna slowly lose friends, human interactions, lack of  subjects to talk about, and end up totally isolated.

It's not true.

Since the beginning of the containment, some old friends decided to call me to see how I was going.

I do, along with 5 other friends, ""Movie Nights"" on Google Hangouts  (allowing us to see everybody's face and reactions during the film)  every Friday evenings, always beginning with everyone cheering ""around"" a  beer before.

We play Cards Against Humanity online. We play Jackbox together and have tons of laughs.

I meet new and surprisingly interesting people on the multiplayer videogames I play. I have endless conversations with them. I speak to  people from different origins and situations than mine.

In supermarkets, as they monitor the density of the population inside, allowing people getting in only if others finished their shopping and got out, I feel less ""pressure"" from the people surrounding me. Same in the empty streets everytime I really need to go outside (go get my meds at the pharmacy...).

For me, containment has only brought me the experience of a more suitable life adapted to my condition.

Containment could be a Hell for you right now, but as you can see, for some people, the ""regular life with no containment"" IS THE REAL HELL.And yet we have to deal with that ""normal life"" everyday, with people not understanding why we struggle so much, thinking we're too weak, lack willingness, that we should force ourselves so we get used to all of that (most of the time, we don't).

Please understand this. People with medical conditions, who are struggling with them like me, can live  ""normally"" and even happily with less stress and exhaustion, if the ""normal"" people do a little extra effort to make our daily lives more bearable.

Allowing for example remote work is crucial.I'm also thankful that some supermarkets in France have taken the initiative to arrange  special hours only for disabled or elderly people, dimming the lights with no constant noisy calls and music.

I just wanted to share this.

\[TL ; DR\] :I have a psychiatric condition and even if containment is a Hell for  you to live right now, some of us are actually perceiving this momentum  like Heaven, almost willing that it will never stop.Your normal life could be the real Hell for some people.Please be attentive with us. We know it could mean making some extra effort for you, but it could be life-saving for some.

Thank you.",12Apr2020,5
180,"Hey guys, I hope I do not come off as rambling, but I have no idea what’s going on with my mind recently. 

I’ve been good in the last two years. Really good. Just to paint the picture, I beat a depression that used to cripple me up until late 2018, and in 2019, it felt as if I was getting better at life every single day. I learned how to be confident, improved my social skills and got really good at talking to women in particular, got accepted into uni, and managed to build a social circle there, something I have never been able to do. 

My physical fitness is better than ever with me working out and doing yoga a lot too, and I made strides in terms of spirituality last year, completing the Transformation Mastery program by Julien Blanc and letting go of a lot of trauma that guided me through life so far. 

Yet, for the last 3 months or so, I started doubting every single achievement of mine, started thinking I just lucked out, am a fraud, had to bend rules and cheat to achieve everything I did and so on... 

I’m working on a business that would help young men gain more confidence just like I did, yet my personal confidence feels at an all time low. 

I just feel like I can’t trust myself with everything, like I do nothing well. No matter what I do, even while meditating or doing yoga I constantly keep thinking that I’m doing something wrong. 

It feels like all the good mindsets I have managed to cultivate throughout the last 3 years broke down, and that makes me feel like even more of a fraud. 

What can I do to stop this vicious downward spiral? I logically know that I have improved so much, but my mind keeps trying to tell me I’m bad at everything and regressing in my progress. I don’t know if it’s just temporary and will pass as long as I continue doing a good hub or if I should be worried and seek help",12Apr2020,1
181,"She's had pretty significant mental health issues for at least a few years, but for the past year she's been almost completely dysfunctional -- she often is profoundly lacking in motivation/resolve and has a lot of trouble even just eating enough (maybe 1-2 meals' worth a day), moving around, or communicating (she's generally pretty articulate when she does talk, but it very often involves waiting literally minutes at a time for her to respond to even simple questions). I don't know too many medical details, but I do know that her PCP has diagnosed her with severe major depressive disorder and said she presents as psychotic -- probably schizophrenia. She has been prescribed a number of antipsychotics at various points (risperidone, aripiprazole, quetiapine, perphenazine), some of which have seemed to help her be more functional for limited periods while hospitalized, but which she's never taken consistently outside of a hospital (even now when she has a visiting nurse).

Unofficially, she has also developed some behaviors that seem possibly indicative of OCD (she's very particular about the placement of certain objects in her room), anorexia (she has a habit of spitting out small amounts of food as she eats), and possibly addiction to lorazepam, which she has also been prescribed. I also believe she has (c)PTSD from various events within the past decade, since she has referenced trauma several times and asked me for help contacting a trauma therapist^(1), although she has mostly been extremely vague about what happened. I unfortunately suspect the original trauma might involve being physically attacked in some way, since she has especially extreme anxiety about sleeping in the same room as anyone else at night, and has called having any roommate ""a safety issue."" She has also recently told me that she doesn't think she would be mentally ill at all if she'd never had any traumatic experiences. I also get the impression from conversation with her that a significant part of her paralysis is from fear of experiencing future trauma, and being consumed with trying to think of how to avoid it.

My parents and I don't know what to do with her, because it's so incredibly difficult to work with her to take meaningful steps toward her recovery -- being ""in crisis,"" as she puts it, has more or less been her baseline for a while now -- and her social/support circle these days is basically limited to us (apart from her other issues, she's also extremely isolated &amp; lonely). Yet when she has called 911 and been admitted to a mental health unit in a hospital, nothing good ever seems to result in a lasting way. It often ends up making her sicker, in part because two of her few remaining passions that help improve her mental health are creative writing and spending time with plants, but there are intense restrictions at hospitals on using computers (which she needs as part of her writing process, in order to refer back to her extensive previous writing) and going outside the unit. She has also described having traumatic experiences in hospitals, such as a doctor resorting to threatening her with ""Section 12"" if she didn't take her meds, or being forced to have a roommate.

And despite spending a total of about FOUR months in FOUR different mental health units over the past year, she's never even once received a referral/transfer to a specialized residential mental health facility -- at least not one that she's been able to follow up on herself, or willing to tell us about. (The closest they've come to this that I know about is: a recommendation to go to the Walden Center in Waltham MA (for eating disorders), which she declined; help finding her a visiting nurse; and help applying for assisted housing from the department of mental health in Massachusetts, where she lives. Not that that's come through yet due to long waiting lists, of course.) We've tried to do some research into facilities like this ourselves, but the impression we've gotten so far is that patients generally need to be able to do basic self-care, and that there is often a schedule including required meetings, appointments, activities, etc. She has great difficulty with/resistance to anything imposed on her against her will, especially on a specific schedule. And she definitely needs more assistance and monitoring than she would get through intensive outpatient or partial hospitalization programs.

So my question is... how do we, her family, support her in getting on a sustainable road to recovery? Is a residential mental health facility theoretically the best (only?) plausible option? (How do we support her in taking steps toward going to one when she can barely do ANYTHING for herself?) Do you have any ideas of specific facilities that would be a good fit? If there is one out there somewhere, it would have to meet *all* of these criteria:

* Patients aren't expected to take care of themselves (at least for a while at first) and can get help taking care of basic needs
* Structure is provided, but there are no rigid restrictions or schedules that can't easily be personalized to the current needs of the patient in question
* Frequent individualized therapy is provided
* There is both a strong sense of community and privacy when one needs it
* Opportunities for creative pursuits, and spending time outside/in areas with lots of plants, are readily available and encouraged
* The staff do not believe, consciously or not, that they are ""better than"" their patients
* Accepting new patients despite the situation with covid-19

*Ideally*, this facility would also not be really far from Massachusetts, and wouldn't cost more than, say, $50k/yr out of pocket (considering that she has MassHealth insurance)... but we're pretty desperate and are willing to seriously consider just about anything that seems like it would be a really good fit otherwise. Thank you so much for reading and giving this some thought!

&amp;#x200B;

**tl;dr** My sister is too severely mentally ill to live independently right now, or even to qualify for/do well at many residential mental health facilities, yet psychiatric hospital stays are TOO rigid/structured and make her sicker. What are her most plausible paths to recovery?

&amp;#x200B;

^(1) To be clear, I did reach out multiple times to this therapist when she asked for help with that, but he's been totally unresponsive, and she hasn't yet had the energy/wherewithal to talk with me about other therapists AFAICT, even just to give me the go-ahead to reach out to them on her behalf as well. Also, in the past our mom has done extensive research into therapists for her and given her lists of them, but she inevitably either doesn't follow up or takes some issue with a therapist and refuses to contact them/keep seeing them. So we're disinclined to contact any more therapists without consulting her first.",12Apr2020,1

A 9 month old who literally never leaves my side and an autistic 4.5 year old who is having his own meltdowns all the time. I feel like I just need time to myself; so I can gather my thoughts and calm down. But, I don’t ever get that. I’ve tried to talk to my husband about how much I need this in order to function. I tell him that it’s unfair that he gets to stay up till 6am every night trying to be a “streamer” aka play video games with his friends. Then, he just sleeps during the day. While I go to bed with the kids and get up with the kids. Spend all day with the kids. He’ll get up in the afternoon and not do anything with them besides getting my oldest a drink or making dinner. Like even as I’m typing this; he’s sleeping. I’m sitting on the couch and one kid is playing on the couch literally right against me. And the other is holding onto the couch to trying to get up here. This is just constant. I try to talk to my husband and he says, “you get time alone at work (mail carrier) and you could just stay up later” 🙄 Really? Plus, being stuck in the house only makes it worse. My 9 month old has sleep regression right now and is only taking 20 minute naps during the day. I need a break so badly. I’m just so tired. And my husband sits there and tells me that I need help. Yes! Yeah, I fucking do! I need your ass to help me. I told him that I need like an hour or 2 a day.

So like I’ve had a couple relationships.
First one, it was good and great, and my girlfriend was upset and her sister and brother forced her to drink alcohol to forget me , and I couldn’t do anything about it because it was too late. I had a mental breakdown 

After a few months I got better. A few years down the line, I had another girlfriend! And I sent her love letters, and I bought her a Bible from Amazon, and i think she loved it. And then she told me she was currently getting raped, and don’t want to call the cops. And so I tried helping her. I tried convincing her that things would get better if she just told
Someone! She was telling that she was getting raped by her abusive father and she would again in a couple weeks. I felt powerless. And so I prayed and fasted and nothing worked! And she told me she got raped again in a phone call, and I lost it and called the cops. And then I found out she was lying to me the whole time weeks later.

And then I met another girl named megan, and she was the first girl to let me hold her hand and put my arm around her, and I got her roses and a jar of confidence with encouraging quotes because she was insecure. then she told me she got raped too. But then months later it was revealed in the court system she was lying. 

Then I met another girl, and she was named Autumn, and she lied to me. And she mentally abused me by pulling me in and pushing away. And that was after I emotionally invested in her, and it broke my heart

Now I’m insecure and idk if anyone could ever love me, and I’m in a relationship now, and she hasn’t given me any reason to believe it’s fake. But I still feel like something bad is going to happen. Can any fellow Christians encourage me? Or even if you aren’t a Christian?",12Apr2020,1

When you get down and blocked every way of picking yourself up For example you got this mindset that you are bad at socialising that you have no worth that you can't add anything to a conversation that you ask yourself why would somebody want to spent time with me and you don't have an answer to it. You'll get scared that if you talk to people your fears will become reality. You don't want to talk about your thoughts to other people because you fear of getting pittied on and these people just wanting to talk with you not for the person you are, but for the problem you have. You start to ask yourself am I depressed, do I need help. What will my family think about this, will I be a disappointment to them. They try their best but do I even try my best. I don't know anymore. What is even depression you ask yourself. You google the definiton but it's vague. You don't know so you try to cheer yourself up it works but for how long. Then you think back at the Idea of having friends and you say to yourself I'll think about that tomorrow I don't have time for this It's not that bad why would I need friends. But the thought thats still on your mind is why am I this way, my family has no problem dealing with their mental health so am I the odd one? You know that if sometings odd its different its alone. So you get deeper in thought do I even deserve friends am I good enough, why would anybody I haven't got a connection since I was a child want me? You search but you find no reason.

The next day you analyse the situation and you sill have no clue if your depressed you carry on from your thoughts you try to cheer up distract yourself from your thoughts. Am I just wanting attention is that it. You'll start seeing that words you thought you know the meaning of are not like they seemed they were. It gets more difficult like a spiderweb made by multiple spiders its starts of with one but grows into 10 20 then 50 untill it gets difficult to concentrate very very difficult.

I even lost my thought there if you didn't notice till now Im talking about myself. I don't know if Im depressed I don't think I am and I think thats good or rather I don't call it depression we associate depression with crying suicide beeing ill. Im not Ill im fine maybe I don't really know ith something like beeing deprived of fun and beeing put down by yourself its really weird. I am also lonely I'm many more things that beeing depressed How you wage that is your opinion but In my opinion its not that bad its just something I can't explayn. I've been without any friends in reallife for about two and a half years now there have been many ups and downs but I seem to be fine it's just that I sometimes wish that someone was there to grab my hand and throw me into an unexpected situation something to get me out of my comfort zone, but Im a person who builds up many walls to avoid that its weird huh to read this and think this must have written by two different persons. But It hasn't it has been all by me. I got this talent of cutting out my emotions of beeing completely transparent with myself. I just started doing this now to explain a bit about myself for everyone who reads this and thinks of wanting to help me to please not to I would feel bad about it that I don't deserve it. I just would like to express myself to let it all out for once I don't do that usually. Why? I don't know I don't wanna bother anyone with it. Beeing self aware is great but its also the worst thing that can happen to you.

198,"Hello!

I've decided to start a mental health podcast.
I've always been passionate about helping others and many have encouraged me to follow that passion so I thought to myself why not give podcasting a go.
I'll be covering many different topics as I have a lot of personal experience with many mental health related struggles. 
I have created cover art and an intro/outro track.
For my first episode I was thinking of answering a few questions about myself and the podcast .

Any suggestions for questions I could answer related to myself or the podcast?

200,"Hi, I’ve been diagnosed with manic depression since I was 12. I’ve had a hard time but never had effects of paranoia. When I was younger like maybe 7 or 8 I became super paranoid and slept with my older sister who was 18 till I was 12 because I couldn’t stand being alone. I just grew up of it and never really thought about it. When I was younger I always thought I was hearing things but it kinda stopped for long enough for me to forget and act like it no longer was happening for me. I guess that’s not how things work because for the last two weeks I’ve been having extreme paranoia at night and am convinced someone is out there to hurt me or that I’m not safe. I keep hearing things and when I check nothing is there. My medication make my vision a little distorted in low light which makes everything worse because I keep feeling like I feel / see shadows or someone is in my room watching. It gets to the point I feel in shock unable to move with my hands shaking an insane amount and heartbeat completely elevated. I haven’t ever talked to my therapist or doctor about this because it hadn’t occurred or when it did it wasn’t often and I’d just forget about it. Now I feel it repeated and even worse. I was talking to myself saying it’s okay and swear I heard someone in the room say it back to me? I get panic attacks very quickly when I get scared and then it feels like a hole where I am convinced I am going to die right now. Has anyone experienced this? Is this normal for people with depression it is new to me as of recent and I’m freaking out because it’s getting so bad!! please someone give me some input thank you! maybe I’m imagining it? I don’t know",12Apr2020,2
201,"Ever since I got off my meds I only been on them for 6 days, it has been one month a lot has changed, I don’t feel like myself completely emotion blunting some might think that’s a good thing but actually is  the worse thing can happen to you. Let me explain what I feel, one things I have noticed is not being able to defend myself since u feel nothing. not being able to connect with anyone, I feel like a robot acting as a human. My libido is completely gone, complete lost control over my body sometimes u might not be able to orgasm or hold it. PE happen with random sexual thoughts. My hair is thinning, no appetite I lost so much weight seems like my body isn’t producing enough hormones to hold muscles. I feel very weak and anxious all the time, my penis shrunk dramatically, I feel very small mentally and physically. The thought of dying consistently on my mind",12Apr2020,1

Certainly not a standard post, but I've seen many here discuss their struggles with depression and how they cope. In short, my girlfriend is going through a severe bout with depression at the moment and I have no idea how to help. 

She's always struggled, far before we started dating. We both talked about our mental health and our struggles early on, both of us knew we shouldn’t rely on each other for our sole source of happiness. It felt like a good start to a healthy relationship. Things for her though especially after the quarantine have really gotten bad. She’s never found a medication that suits her, and one of the only things she ever put hope in to was eventually finding a doctor who cares enough to find the right medication for her. I’m not sure how many therapists or medications she’s had, but its certainly more than 3-4 doctors and over 5 different types of medication. . 

Things were good when we both had hope in something. I’ve struggled with severe, often suicidal, depression; but I somehow never lost hope things would get easier. In the darkest moments, I’d somehow think of a bright future where I was surrounded by a group of people I love with no worries. I never lost sight of that hope and it helped me. 

She put hope in to eventually finding medication, but in the last few weeks… that hope has pretty much eaten itself alive. The most recent medication she was prescribed had pretty bad symptoms to her. Those symptoms included pretty bad nausea, cramps, headaches. She was even convinced she was pregnant a few days ago from how bad her morning sickness was. After speaking with her doctor, she realized her ailment was caused by the medication she was taking. This pretty much killed any hope she had for eventually beating and learning to live with depression.. Not only did the medication not work, it made her mental health significantly worse. 

I feel like my experience with depression is blinding an obvious answer. We have gone through similar problems, but had completely different ways of coping and put our hope into completely different things. At this point, I honestly have no idea what to say to her whenever she tells me how she feels. “Please don’t give up.” “It’ll get better,” I feel like whatever I say means nothing in the long run. I know I shouldn’t be the one to fuckin ‘cure’ her, and I shouldn’t expect myself to. But it hurts like hell seeing someone you deeply care for lose hope in something they’ve desperately needed to work out.   


Is there anyone here who has gone through a similar situation she has? Any ways you distracted yourselves or learned to eventually cope?",12Apr2020,2
203,"(please notice: english is not my first language)

This is not a joke. Today I stumbled upon this meme and the accuracy with which it was able to describe some of my behaviours left me speechless. Let me start by reporting you what the meme said and then I'll move to the actual question of the post.

So the meme is captioned ""19 year old thinker"" and describes a wojack-like character with the following behaviour:

\-Has created entire anthologies of imaginary events

\-Completely unaware of surroundings, except when driving

\-Inner monologue has become his entire reality

\-Has had multiple imaginary girlfriends

\-Imagines what it be like to start over with everything he's learned

\-Can't understand new things, gets caught in analysis paralysis. Just thinks about things he already knows.

\-Has no interest in any carreer, just wants to think

\-Thinks are always better in my head

\-Can't listen to music without pretending he's the artist

\-Barely reads. just thinks

\-hedgehog dilemma

Now, I'm sure the majority of people will find this at least a little relatable. What scares me is the extent to which this applies to me. Every single point in the list is something true/that I do on a daily basis. And many of these thoughts are actually somewhat debilitating for me, meaning that I've had the feeling that something was not right when doing/thinking them, as if I was concious that I was losing touch with reality. But I think them all the time. Even things like ""Can't understand new things, gets caught in analysis paralysis. Just thinks about things he already knows."" or ""Can't listen to music without pretending he's the artist"" , which seem somewhat oddly specific, they perfectly describe me. This meme made me realize for the first time that all these ""symptoms"" could be linked to something, and I wonder what that is. Again, I know that many people probably have these toughts too, but I am worried because the frequency and intensity of these ,and alike, thoughts, really do have an impact on my life and my attachment to reality.

I wonder if you can help me figure out what the common cause of these thoughts could be. I have recently read about compusive daydreaming, and I belive some of these bahaviours seem to fit in the symptoms of the syndrome.  Thank you.

204,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Prefacing this by saying I'm not actively suicidal and have been on a medication that has worked well for over a year. A tweet came across my timeline that some health professionals are predicting that life won't resemble any bit of normalcy for at least a year and a half+. The immediate thought that popped into my head was ""wow, I bet murder suicides are going to sky rocket"" and sure enough, they have (quick google estimates domestic violence murder suicides are up 100%).

I live alone and work from home, so I could see the attraction of offing yourself if the professionals you're supposed to trust are telling you that life will lack a lot of the finer, enjoyable things for quite some time. So my question is: how are people who are already depressed and feel hopeless supposed to stay positive? Obviously, we have to be realistic and cannot sugarcoat what the data is likely projecting, but these brutal timelines are going to do a number on a larger amount of people than we think (i.e people in isolation, older folks, parents who are already at their wits end with children and significant others, medical workers, etc.) Seems like there's no right answer here.",12Apr2020,3
205,Ugly has layers. Most don't know what ugly means. Ugly is inside and out. Outside being the most painful. Inside being the most hated. I'm outside ugly. Causing empty inside. Does inside ugly give up? Outside ugly does. Outside ugly is simple. Inside ugly a puzzle. Both a struggle. At least it is for me. Outside ugly nobody see your inside. Inside ugly nobody wants to see your outside. At the end of day I'm so ugly outside my inside becomes ugly. At the end of the day inside ugly becomes outside. Society determines your ugly. My ugly is based on your ugly about my ugly.,12Apr2020,3

211,"Hello! I just launched a website called \[[TicsAndThoughts.com](https://TicsAndThoughts.com)\]([https://ticsandthoughts.com](https://ticsandthoughts.com)) - basically my thought is to have a place with posts relating to OCD, Tourette's, and Mental Health in general. Currently have it set up to 3 different categories of posts: General info, Resources, and Research Reviews. Hoping to eventually get user-submitted ideas and have it be an educational forum for anybody that's interested in the above topics!

&amp;#x200B;

It's very basic right now as I'm completely new to creating a website but I have a ton of ideas for it and thought some of my fellow mental health friends might enjoy it/have some ideas. I'd really appreciate it if anybody had a second to check it out and, if they have any, provide feedback/suggestions/ideas! Thanks guys!

&amp;#x200B;

212,"Today me and my boyfriend were arguing and I got annoyed at him (on facetime) and he chucked his phone and I was like laughing telling him to smash it harder and harder then he picked up a glass photo frame and smashed his head with it (he is okay), I do love him with all my heart and I hate him hurting but I also love him hurting and i feel nothing, it's like there is 2 sides of me and I don't know which is the real me?
I've killed animals in the past (mainly because they were annoying me or I was bored or I wanted to play like to have fun).
Me and my boyfriend have rough sex, I tell him to hurt me and I hurt him too.
I have constant thoughts of killing people and really hurting them. 
I lack empathy.
I get excited when imagining killing someone (I think sexually too)

213,"Someone needs to be awake in the house at all times and stay close to my mother to get her meds if she starts having a seizure. my role was meant to take the nights, from 10 pm until 10 am the next morning, just to be awake and keep an eye on things. My father was supposed to handle the daytime. Its just the three of us here and mom isnt in a situation where she can care for herself but she isnt covered for any inpatient care.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem 1: we agreed on the hours But my father is passed out before 9 pm every night, leaving me with the extra hour to get started.

Problem 2: by the time 10 am rolls around. im so stressed out that it's impossible to get any sort of break and take a nap to recharge, let alone get any significant amount of sleep.

P3: my father relies on me to do the day to day cleaning, dishes, trash, and to keep an eye on mom well into the day so he can sit in the other room with his feet up and take a nap in the middle of the day.

&amp;#x200B;

Solution? I guess I get used to sleeping 2 hours a day while still physically having to lift mom off her chair or the bed, cooking, cleaning, answering phone calls from the nurses and doctors, preparing her daily medications, giving her her seizure meds, calling the team of hospice nurses, keeping track of exactly WHEN she got her first dose and when she started seizing. coordinating and delegating tasks to my absentminded father, and somewhere between all of that..... I need time to shit and feed myself.

Its not just mom circling the drain here and I don;t even know how to let my family know that I cant maintain. It feels like im being crushed all the time while being pulled in all directions.",12Apr2020,3
