0,"Its been 2 years ive been feeling this way now, helpless,  exhausted and always with a feeling that I am never good enough for anyone even myself. This covid situation has just intensified things for me. There are times where I wake up in the morning and just cry helplessly for no reason. I haven't told this to anyone but sometimes during theres episode I have bad thoughts about myself, I know I will not do it because in the end I just keep thinking of my loved ones, but the thought do come into my mind. My chest feels heavy everytime and I am just exhausted from this feeling now. I constantly overthinking each and every thing in my life leading to such episodes and I cant even stop it. I dont truly feel happy anymore and I feel like I am a disappointment to everyone. Its rare for me to even feel motivated to do anything but I still try to set a few goals to do in a day. I live in a very toxic environment with no privacy and In a completely new country on my own for the first time. I just feel lost amd hopeless. I haven't seen anyone about this and I feel embarrassed to get help or if this is even worth getting checked.",30Apr2020,1
1,"   I've had depression and sucidal thoughts for a while, but I've been at my lowest lately. I was walking my dog and I got near a shooting range. They didn't start shooting when I got here, and I didn't expect them to do it considering the time and the quarantine, which is why I got there.
   The first guy shot. I just broke. The sound was just stuck in my head. It wasn't that loud, but it was painful. I was really confused so I just got back to my house and slept for a bit, thinking that I was just tired. It's been 4 days since it happened. I still have the sound, but most importantly the feeling the bullet.
   I'm still pretty young (16yo) so I never saw or touched a bullet. It doesn't interest me overall. However, I can feel it. The pressure  on my head, the weight of the bullet, the feel of the metal and the sound that comes with it. 
   To be clear: I'm not scared by guns or death. So I don't understand why this is happening. I feel like I'm starting to get crazy. What is happening to me ??",30Apr2020,1
2,"I posted this in r/casualconversation but it got taken down because it’s considered venting (I didn’t think so but I guess it is) so I thought it might fit here. 

I just wanted to share these thoughts/way of thinking that someone else told me that impacted my life positively. 

I feel like many people don’t realize that mental health is your health in the way that physical health is. Mental health is as important as your physical health and I think many of us don’t see it that way. 

There are situations where our mental health is at risk but where if our physical health was at risk we would make a different decision or it would be easier to make the decision that is better for us. 

An example to illustrate this(sorry I can’t think of a better example right now &gt;.&lt;): deciding to stay at a place that is making your mental health worse but would leave if it was making your asthma worse. 

Hopefully someone who needed to see/hear this does :)",30Apr2020,1
3," Can I hear from people who are NOT experiencing sexual side effects from Lexapro? I was on it years ago and I don't recall it being an issue, but I'm about to go back on it for anxiety and I'm really concerned about it. The internet is generally a very bad place to assuage these types of fears, so I figured I would... Ask the internet. 😄",30Apr2020,1
4,"But when I look it up, stress is not listed as one of the causes for it on various sites. I'm actually the least stressed I've been in ages.       
Diabetes was ruled out via a blood test.
It could be my drinking, but I dont drink enough for this kind of damage.     
She did begin to offer a medication, but after she saw I was already on 4 medications ( apparently that's a lot for my age, I'm 24) she decided against it.
She didnt offer any other treatment.         
I've only had this for a couple months, but it's already progressed to most of the day and now theres stabbing pains too.    According to my research, neuropathy progresses without treatment, to the point it can affect other stuff, like balance. It's already affecting my sleep which I said on the phone.      
She just said to call back if it stops me from living a normal life, which sooner or later it will do.        
I don't want to be dealing with this.      
I already have PTSD,  BPD, alcoholism,  dyspraxia, asthma and chronic gastritis. 
Hopefully this is something fatal.",30Apr2020,1
5,"When I was younger I spent weekends with my grandparents (like I stayed over every Saturday and Sunday night) with my older brother. One year when I was 8 or 9 my grandfather died, I then found out a month later that my grandmother had cancer and dementia and that my family suspected that my grandfather died of a broken heart due to finding this out. At the time I didn't understand what dementia did to someone until I started to pay attention to my grandma, I noticed her repeating herself and forgetting things, this worried me. In April that year me and my older brother stayed at my grandparents house like we always did, in the morning I got up early so my grandmother didn't go to the shop by herself, as I sat eating my breakfast I heard a bang and rushed through to see my grandmother lying lifeless on the floor, with blood trickling from what I thought to be her head. Me panicked, I rushed upstairs to wake my brother and returned downstairs to keep an eye on my grandma while my brother called an ambulance, I asked my grandma to lift her head slightly so I could place a kitchen towel under her head to soak up the blood and make her head feel better on the concrete slabs. They didn't believe us, the hospital, at first asking if we are lying and where our parents were. My brother then called our mother and then our father (they split up when we were younger) my father arrived a few minuites before my mother and picked my grandma up off the hard tiled kitchen floor. The ambulance arrived a few moments after that and me and my older brother went home with our mother.
We found out later that my grandma had gotten a dizzy spell and hit the corner of her eye on the corner of the kitchen side (keep in mind this is made of marble and is apart of the house not just a table). 
After my grandma ""recovered"" she was never the same, she repeated the same question ""have you guys gotten the Easter eggs off the counter?"" About a dozen times. My grandma then died after she gave up her battle with cancer.

Does anyone else have a similar story? Or am I just a very unfortunate child.",30Apr2020,1
6,I know I should get up and eat something but I don’t have the energy to and don’t even want to. I don’t normally talk about it but I’m hoping maybe just getting it off my chest will help me decide if I’ll eat today or if I’ll hide all the mirrors in my house and go back to bed,30Apr2020,1
7,"So I was prescribed 20mg Fluoxetine to take daily around the end of February this year because of a big flare in my anxiety/panic symptoms (had been doing much better before which is why I was off meds).

So anyway, I started taking the Fluoxetine daily after breakfast, along with Clonazepam 0.5mg before bed as prescribed by my psychiatrist.

But then I think I made a big mistake. After about a little more than a month (late March or so) I just decided to quit on the Fluoxetine, because I was getting some really unpleasant side effects like REALLY decreased libido among other things. However, I kept taking and still am taking the Clonazepam because I've heard all the horror stories about quitting benzos cold turkey and stuff. And while I've read that antidepressants also cause withdrawal symptoms, they're not life threateaning like benzo withdrawal.

Anyway, fast forward about a month after I quit the Fluoxetine cold turkey, and I just completely started losing it from INTENSE anxiety. From April 17th to today, I've been lucky to get like 4 hours of sleep a night, and I've had a few completely sleepless nights, which is making me really fatigued during the day, and I can't even nap during the day without getting these weird adrenaline surges just as I'm drifting off to sleep, which wakes me up and gets me wired and really miserable from being so tired, but unable to sleep.

I know that a month is a long time for withdrawal to start to kick in, but I heard that Fluoxetine has a long half life, which makes it possible for withdrawal to kick in weeks after quitting the drug.

So my question is, do you guys think this intense insomnia I've been experiencing could be from the Fluoxetine withdrawal? Even after a month of feeling fine before? Or is it more likely just to be plain old anxiety playing tricks on me? Also I'm a huge hypocondriac (Health Anxiety), so my mind naturally starts to think of worst case scenarios and I'm obsssessing now about Sporadic Fatal Insomnia, even though it's literally one of the rarest diseases in the world, with like 30 cases recorded in history.

Anyway, any insights would be appreciated. I've come to dread trying to go to sleep because of this. The past two nights I even took some of my mother's Ambien, and it seemed to help with sleep onset, but still can't get me a full 8 hours sleep. I'm pretty desperate, please help!!

PS: can't get a psych consult anytime in the near future because of quarantine, so I'm on my own without professional help for God knows how long.",30Apr2020,1
8,"Good Evening All,

I am looking on advice on what to expect on going about seeking assistance from a counselor or psychologist, etc.

I recently came to the decision that seeking assistance is the best option for me as I have been struggling with some issues for some time. I am on my employers healthcare plan which gives me access to Cigna's list of doctors and nurse practitioners (though Cigna itself is not my health care provider, its another company). And from their list I know how to look up mental health providers. So that part is fine.

I guess everything else I am unsure of. Like when I call to set up an inital appointment, what kind of questions do they ask? And when I arrive, what can I expect from my first visit? While I am aware of my own decision to seek professional help, at the same time it feels awkward to speak to a stranger about my personal problems and don't want to psyche myself out of not going. Really any advice from someone who has gone through this experience will be appreciated. Thanks!!!",30Apr2020,1

12,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this. I haven't been diagnosed with anything except for depression and anxiety (I might have PTSD but I wasn't diagnosed). This has been happening for a while, I'm not sure how long but definitely most of my life. Ever since my ex and I broke up and quarantine it has gotten worse. I always feel like someone is watching me. It had started affecting the way I act, even when I'm alone. I constantly tell myself ""don't do that (insert name) is watching and they'll judge you"" or ""what if they saw that and you'll be an outcast from your friends"". I've also stopped doing ""normal"" things. I'm an artist and I sometimes try to teach myself human anatomy and it's easier with nude models but I've stopped doing that because I'm scared of being judged even though I'm alone and have a valid reason. It has even gotten in the way of me practicing my instrument because I'm terrified of sounding bad and being judged even though I know it's part of the process. Is this normal?

i have no interests or career path but i shouldn’t be making coffee for a living at 25. it’s not me.
i’m not good at anything, believe me i have tried. since 11 i have tried super hard at things like football, badminton, call of duty, fortnite, video editing, even mmorpg games (the only things that i have ever had interest in) i have devoted so many hours to these etc daily and the best i become is mediocre. i can never be at the top. i’m talentless. like you don’t realise how jealous i am seeing people making millions from cod or fortnite when i have busted my ass off for hours daily for months and years yet i still can’t be above average. it fills me with rage.
like right now during lockdown, all i want is to be really good at playing modern warfare, i’m putting in 12+ hours a day grinding but it’s no use i’m still in the middle. 
i have nothing going for me.
i hate being in public because i’m so insecure due to how ugly i am. i can’t even talk to people.

17,"I was wondering if anyone has felt similarly, and how/if they've been able to cope with these feelings if they have: 

I'm 27 years old. I've struggled with depression and PTSD for a long time due to childhood abuse and bullying. I've been out of the abusive environment for 10 years now and have been getting better but it's been a slow process. Mental illness and learning to cope with ADHD also played a role in me needing an extra 2 years to finish undergrad. It's been 2 years post university and I've hit a wall when it comes to trying to start working on long-term goals or projects, like applying for grad school, learning things like languages or musical instruments, etc. 

Every time I try to start on those things I immediately feel stressed because I'm afraid I'm not working on it fast enough, or that I need to get everything done super fast, or that it's going to take too long to see results. My therapist has told me that I shouldn't feel like I have to get all my goals/projects done in one year or a matter of a few months, and that it's unrealistic to try and get things done faster, but I have problems pacing myself because I feel like I've got to make up for the years I lost dealing with mental health and abuse. Like I need to shove three years into every year now to make up for lost time. 

The problem is that I get overwhelmed with trying to undertake too many things at once, in part because of my ADHD, or I'm overwhelmed at the stress I mentioned above. And then I end up not working on anything and more time goes by that I feel I need to make up for. So it turns into a cyclical thing, and has been feeding into my pre-existing stress and depression.",30Apr2020,1
18,"I don't really know if this is the right place to post this kind of thing, but it's been happening to me on and off for a while (feel free to remove if this doesn't qualify). A few months back it happened a couple times a week and then stopped but I was in my kitchen two minutes ago and it happened again.

I guess the best(?) way to describe it is I've been having weird deja-vu panic attacks that give me some sort of flashback to something that I haven't experienced. It'll be triggered by something completely random that is normally fine to me, and then I'll have panic attack symptoms (shortness of breath, general anxiety and heart racing and feeling warm and dizziness/sometimes momentary vision loss and I need to either sit down or hold onto something) and it will kind of feel like I am not there or it's not real life/like I'm not me or something. 

Sometimes it's kind of like flashbacks to dreams I've had or places I feel like I've been in but haven't been? Most/all of them give me a sense of having been there before wherever ""there"" is but it's just a very uncomfortable sensation.

 Also, I have an anxiety disorder and I've been on meds for a few years, and it was way worse at the beginning but I've gotten it mostly under control -- so I know what having a panic/anxiety attack is like for me. These things are similar, but different. They're episodes I guess? It kind of starts by being triggered by something completely random, like today I was getting ice cream from my freezer, or if I'm cooking something. They usually only last a few minutes at the most but are just very strange.

Has anyone had anything similar happen?",30Apr2020,1
19,"My university provides access to this online therapy service called TAO. I started using it early last year when I was feeling extremely anxious and concerned about my future, was feeling extremely low in self esteem. However, I was completing my PhD and was busy writing my thesis, so I just spent few days on it and discarded it right away.

I have never been to therapy. I felt ashamed and embarrassed to do so. Fast forward a year. I graduated with my PhD. However, my anxieties and low self esteem, depressive episodes did not leave me.

I started reading Feeling Good by David Burns last month. I read first chapter and I realized that the TAO app I still had access to also administered Cognitive behavioral Therapy. 

I reinstalled the app, for last two weeks have been working on the modules. I was initially screened for mild to moderate depression. At the moment, I feel lighter. For the first time in my life I am able to see all the patterns in my thinking and actions. Scientific explanations of what's going on in my head has made me aware of the thoughts. 

I am actually feeling better. I am feeling the urge to work, I am not feeling hopeless lately. I am feeling quite good about myself.

I will be continuing on my understanding of my thoughts and actions. I hope to work on the therapy exercises diligently.

Now fortunately I was 2 hours away at the time so that I could vote on Super Tuesday. However, I work with children and immediately after the tornado schools closed for the week.

On July 5th, 2016 I started my long long journey recovering from a crystal methamphetamine addiction that started while I was in high school 10th grade to be exact. I have been clean for almost 4 years. It wasn't easy because two of them years I was away from my family. I have been doing very well for the most part but some long lasting psychological effects have started to show themselves lately. When I got high on meth I did things to a harmful extent. I used to go 2 to 3 days without eating, eat a sandwich and go another 1 to 3 days again and repeat. Things like getting stuck doing something 6 to 7 hours straight like walk back and fourth in a line for no reason whatsoever! 

Now the last two months I have noticed that I'm in that same routine again but without drugs. I have been doing the same thing over and over again and it's been very hard for me to get myself to stop doing it. I haven't been eating right because I can feel my body shift into starvation mode. I'm not worried about the food part because I eat a good amount before bed. I am emotionally stable, happy, not depressed or paranoid but that still comes and goes and will never go away.

25,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar Depression, F29.  I had my life under control, all in neat boxes, I was sexually abused by my step-dad's son when I was seven years old. My parents divorced when I was five and I had to pick sides at an early age. I picked my mother's side, and made her pain my own. I went to boarding school for 3 years and was separated from my mom for about 4 years before we moved to the US. We lived in a crammed 1 bed apartment with 4 adults and 2 children before my mom took us out and moved to a shelter. That is when I had my first breakdown. I was so mad that my mom took us that I had a tantrum, she has always been physical with me and would hit me to calm me down. I was a freshman in h.s. that summer I was in pain from again losing my life. I had to keep it together, that summer in the shelter the only thing that kept me together was reading. High School was good overall, I had good grades, was an athlete and student government. All while working odd jobs to help myself. Senior year, I tried weed and didn't really like it, so it wasn't a constant in my life. I got into a good college with scholarships and took that as my way out, I was finally going to have my own room. I had a bf, and the end of summer before starting college, I got pregnant. I found out about it during orientation week. I was worried, scared, sad, all the feelings that a 17yo would face. I decided to have an abortion that fall. I had post abortion depression, and almost failed the semester. The school sent me to a counselor and therapy, they said I had adhd and gave me meds. The meds helped and I continued therapy and began to get good grades again. I was overall a good student, but the flares of bad blue days were more noticeable. I had days/weeks when I was invincible and days when I couldn't move. I've always worried about my image, so I made sure the outside world wouldn't know. The only one that really saw my downs was my roomie/bestie. I have always had a rough time with sleep and anxiety, there were weeks when i would be in bed with my eyes closed but no real sleep would happen. I began smoking weed, at first it was at night, then during my sophomore year, it was more often, I studied abroad, and that's when the weed usage got intense, from once a day to multiple times a day. I still maintained good grades, and had jobs. By the time Junior and Senior year came around, I was smoking 10-15 times a day, writing a perfect thesis and being super productive. I still had the same bf from hs but really hated him, and loved him at the same time. I graduated with a really good gpa but didn't get my dream job/research position. I lost my life of 4 yrs and went on a spiral, after graduation, I didn't go back home right away, it took me over three months to get to that, i was living in friend's couches, to bf's house, to even staying up all night (it was summer) contemplating my next move. I was lost. But I had to get a real job. 2012 was a rough year for jobs, i finally landed a job in a financial institution early 2013, and had to leave behind my hippie life. My mom was happy i did that, i was not. I hated the idea of losing my freedom. I was still an overachiever, so I had to do good.  I was getting paid and as soon as I had enough, I moved out and broke up with my ex of 7 years. That was the first time I moved out. I was once again free to smoke weed to feel good. My roommate was not keen, and so I had to move out again. Being with a person for 7 years really does something to you, I began experimenting and living an open life. The second roommate was not too bad, just a bit dirty. Then I met the love of my life, the one that would read me like a book and toss me like a pamphlet. I was with him for 3 yrs, he didn't approve of my smoking habits, so for a while i would hide it, and sometimes even quit for periods of time. I now understand myself a lot better, but back then, I was the jealous one, the crazy one, the impulsive one, the emotional one. He cheated on me, I caught him, he lied, and I still stayed with him. That is when break three happened, I was so convinced that he was cheating that I became erratic, paranoid, until i had evidence/proof and confirmation from both parties. That destroyed my low self esteem. I lost weight, overcompensated by working out, trying to be more like her. Work had been eating away from me, little by little. But it was manageable, since it was better than my romantic life. I finally broke things up, moved to another country, and was ready to start new. I only had my job going for me, oh and a killer body. I met another man, slept with him out of courtesy and ended up dating him. But i was still stuck in love with the man that cheated on me. I moved back home and did long distance again and then moved in with the new guy. One thing is having me as a gf and another is living with me. I still can't sleep, i get anxious, paranoid and try to find faults. I had a traumatic three months at work, which gave me PTSD. I spiraled into a depression that was just overwhelming and i ended things. I moved back home, tried ayahuasca for the PTSD, therapy and more to control it. I managed, I was back on top of my game. I moved out again, got a place on my own. I smoked even more, but was doing great, I was alone, had multiple partners and even tried polyamory. While my friends were getting married, I was sleeping around, trying to not get attached and achieving a lot at work. I had weeks when I was a boss, and weeks when i was a peddler, but as long as I showed up and was good, no one would know. I had it all under control. I was making more money that I could count, so I took my family on a two week vacation, all expenses paid, trying to come to terms and build good memories. Not even two days into the trip, i got a call from my dad, he was sick, first it was just a surgery, a day later it was cancer. Another episode for me, i yelled, screamed, cried, pulled my hair, burn my skin with hot showers but nothing would let the pain out. I still had to endure the vacation. My dad omitted that it was terminal cancer, i guess he wanted me to enjoy my time. When I got back home, i was told that a close family member had a car accident and was critical. I went into one of those super hero episodes, i could handle everything and anything. Week one went by, working 50+ hours to make up for the time that i had taken off, and running around to take care of all the logistics of the accident, got insurance covered up, lawyer lined up, lived in the hospital for at least 2 weeks. Then another call, i was told that i needed to go see my dad, because he wasn't doing as good as what he had told me. I traveled to see him, and was told it was terminal. The man i saw then, was a spec of what my father was once. This time around, i regressed, i became a child of five again, i started sucking my thumb again and using a stupid squeaky voice whenever i talked to him. I threw tantrums, and looked for things that were familiar but nothing would change the fact that he was dying in front of me. My mom had in her mind that a transfusion of mother cells from his children would help him, so we did the tests, that and a bunch of tests to rule out cancerous cells in our bodies. I had to leave my dad since i didnt have any more time off. When i was back home, i got my results, there were anomalies and i was told to do more tests. Manic self came out to play, i was sure i had cancer too, and two more weeks went by, weeks that i was not a person, i wrote my will, i was happy to leave, as long as i would go with my dad, we could keep each other company. I couldn't work, think, live. i began to drink a lot, and smoke even more. I finally got my results back after cat scans was told that i didnt have cancer, but they didnt know why my hormones were all over the place. pancreatic cancer was ruled out, but tests will have to be periodic. The same day i got my results, i told my dad, i was going to live, but had to hang up the phone because my manager was calling for something, that was the last conversation i had with him. dad, i dont have cancer... i got a call the following morning, he had crashed and was in an induced coma. no breaks for me. i was all alone, and had to bear that pain. after four days in a coma, i was told they were going to disconnect him, i had to say goodbye. i told my manager, he warned me that if i left again, i was going to look bad to clients, and my job would suffer. He said, you do what you must, but be aware that it doesn't look good and there are consequences. i didn't care, i told him, i only have one dad and clients many. i flew out to see him, to find out that it was a lie that his sister made up, but it was too late, i had taken bereavement. a partial lie really, he was not going to make it. he fought for his life, i saw his body decay everyday, the smell of blood after dialysis, the swelling of his limbs, the change of his skin, and the tears in his eyes, i saw that everyday twice a day for ten days. I had to go back to work, and left him, hopping that he would come back. I was back at work, he was dead but alive. i was alive, but dead inside. the last thing he made me promise was that i would stop smoking weed, he died ten days later from a heart attack after dialysis. for ten days i suffered, prayed, yelled, screamed, cried, all on my own. for ten days, the outside world saw me as an orphan. i wasn't able to bury my father, because of a lie that i was told. i do not lie, and had to keep up with the lie for 10 whole days. I didn't grieve, i stopped smoking, stopped drinking, stopped living the moment he passed. every time the phone rang, i would jump, startled at what was next. I didn't sleep, i was alone, and i started to hear things, see things that weren't there, i was paranoid. i thought it was time for me to lose everything. I just worked and worked and never slept, but then things on my phone started to disappear, i was going through a melt down and was paranoid that my job had found out that my dad died 10 days after what i had told them. i was so worried, about what they would think of me, and at the same time, i was worried they were coming after me. I didn't want to live anymore, i took anxiety medication, and sleeping pills, but still no sleep, no rest, just the constant smell of blood, the images of a  decaying body are hard to forget. I started to have suicidal thoughts, my perfect under control life was gone, i wanted to be gone too, before i lost it all. i was paranoid that i was going to be fired, i had a bad relationship with my manager, and he was mad after i chose my dad over work. I started to self harm, when i was slicing my skin the pain would disappear, whenever the images of death would show up, it was easier to bang my head than to see them. The pills weren't working, the candles wouldn't get rid off the smell of decay. I just had to work to get through it, to keep my job. but the the job was too getting out of my hands, everything that was solid became a gas, and my mind went with it. The paranoia got to me, i bought a new phone, i was so sure my job was watching my every move that i became paralyzed with fear. I. had to end it. it was either paranoia or a new beginning so i quit. i just quit, before i was fired, i quit before i was told to leave. I was told not to quit and take some time off and go to therapy, this is after i had ended up in the hospital, as of then, no one had seen my arms, the bruises in my body, all self inflicted. at first the doctors said i was grieving, they sent me to more therapy, from one place to another, therapy was not working, i went into a deeper depression, i had to leave my perfect apartment and move back with my mother so that someone could watch me. i could only leave home for therapy, and even that was really hard. i didn't shower, ate too much, slept too much, then slept nothing, then wouldn't eat, and repeat. I knew i couldn't go back to work, not because i was fired or because i had tried to quit, but because the last straw that broke me down, were the words that my manager said to me. the paranoia was there because he injected the thought of losing the only thing that i had left.  While i was away licking my wounds, many rumors were spread, amongst them, that i had lost it due to pressure from work. Rumors that came to me from others, which only made my decision to not go back stronger. I was lucky to get another job, from someone that took the time to reach out to me to ask me how i was doing. I took the job, handed my resignation and waited until my doctor said it was ok for me to go back to work. I am still depressed, I still don't have a reason to want to live, but i am no longer paranoid. They diagnosed me with bipolar depression, I am worried that people would look at me different because of that. I have had a particularly interesting life, there have been many things in my life that have broken me down, I am depressed, I did mourn, but not only mourned the death of my father, but also the death of my compartmentalized life, the one i kept together, before it unraveled. I am 29yo, i am working on finding happiness everyday, somedays like today, I think of ending the misery, but hope that tomorrow, the thought of being alive would fuel me to continue. I am still bipolar, I am working on being in between, not too high, not too low, just in the right place.  I have kept my promise, I am going to live.",30Apr2020,1

so I was abused by my father (mentally and physically) from like grade 5-9 after my mom left &amp; parents got divorced (divorced happened bc he was being abusive to her &amp; then when she left the abuse went to my sister &amp; I ) . child services had to come in and now I live full time with my mom.  therapist thinks my dad is a narcissist. my younger sister who I was &amp; still am very protective of &amp; who was also abused was diagnosed with autism a couple of years ago when she was in high school. Just writing this so you know my situation. 

I got me some anxiety &amp; mild depression. I was also bullied throughout elementary &amp; for my first year of high school (switched schools after). I currently struggle to process my emotions &amp; really feel them BECAUSE IF U IGNORE THEM THEY DONT EXIST RIGHT!!!! anyways I know that not a good thing but whatever I suppose. also I am HSP (highly sensitive person) which is like I feel things deeper than most people. 

if u have made it this far into my life story. im sorry and thank u. 

anyways I feel like my past super haunts me &amp; idk man I just want to be happy but idk how to get over this shit from the past. been going to therapy for 7 years and I think its helped me but it also has given me this like self pity???? or something? like I just see myself as fucked up &amp; am constantly worried I cant get out of this. 

anyways if u have been in this situation pls let me know. thank god reddit is anonymous bc I don't like telling ppl my shit. 

if u can have anyway to change this mindet pls comment or whatever.",30Apr2020,1

I don't really know what the hell is going on with my sister but she's pretty strong and I love her, so I just hope she's ok. She only has her husband directly close to her to support her.

On my dad's side, my religious family just defers all their problems to god, shirking any real personal accountability. On my mom's side, my aunt is a doctor and is neurotic as fuck and thinks she knows what's going in my head and why I've abused drugs in the way I have. She does not. She doesn't have a clue. All her daughters live abroad. They all talk every day, which I don't understand. I never wanna talk to any of these folk by nature. I appreciate them being there but I really feel as if no one exposes their problems because they're too proud or something. I can't really make up or down of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have my own share of problems too. But I rarely divulge them with my family because I honestly don't think it's their business, and also with how much shit they have going on how can they even pretend to be a help for me?

My boss is incredibly emotionally and verbally abusive towards me. He also has done several other horrible things like DIDNT give me my bonus when he said he would and I was owed it, limiting how many patients I see so I don’t make a bonus, accuse me of doing things I didn’t do, etc. He is constantly raising his voice at me and snarling and making nasty comments. Just today he snarled at me repeatedly “DO BETTER, STEP UP, YOURE DOING A HORRIBLE JOB” bc I didn’t know the answer to a question that had nothing to do with my job position. I was in hysterics and cried so much the rest of the day. 

I need to stick it out, I’m due in about 10 weeks. I can always go on disability and then take my maternity leave but disability pays like CRAP and I need the money.

Some more background: this dude fired my coworker when she was 6 months pregnant. And another pregnant woman before that. Has made fun of my pregnancy multiple times.

35,"Ok, quick story time.

I have done LSD multiple times. For the (probably) majority of people on this sub who don’t know what tripping is like, let me explain the important stuff, at least as best as i can. 

First off, I’ve heard every argument against psychedelic use, and all of them are arguments that I just fundamentally disagree with, since they follow the principal that consciousness should have restricted access. I’ve never had more desire to better my life than after my last trip, and acid was the only thing able to give me that motivation. So please don’t try to steer me away from psychedelic use, as I just respectfully disagree with you. I don’t even wanna do it again until i have some of my shit sorted out.

When you’re on acid, at least for me, it becomes very clear what you should and shouldn’t focus your mind on. i see all my daily anxieties as nothing but things distracting me from what’s important (also, you can never remember “what’s important” afterwards. it just doesn’t make sense in a sober mind). I also see my unwillingness to forgive myself and others as more distractions, and ego driven decisions. You’re ego is a complete fucking illusion but that’s a while other can of worms. The colors and fractals are some of the most beautiful shit you will ever set your eyes upon, don’t get me wrong, but this mental affect is what was so damn freeing for me. 

So, I want help being able to do this sober. I talked to my therapist about this, and she told me that her job is to help me achieve that state when i’m sober. However, I obviously don’t have access to her 24/7, and I want to hear how other people are able to do this.

One thing that I can barely deal with is nighttime despair and emptiness. Everything is okay during the day usually... but when night hits, it is *awful*. I live alone, I don’t really have anyone in general, and that depression and loneliness tenfold until I end up in the fetal position, feeling like I’m buried alive in it.

44,"So, I’m diagnosed with DPDR and OCD and Im trying to get somewhere with my therapist in this situation, though my last psychiatrist said because of my age, the symptoms I described to her, and the fact my grandmothers brother had schizophrenia, that it’s crucial I pay attention to signs I’m developing schizophrenia. I don’t feel I have it, as I’m a very rational person and I dont think I see or hear things, I just overthink that I’m misconstruing normal sounds and sights to my anxieties. But I do believe certain things: a common thing is that I believe is that I’m being watched. I’m know no one is watching me, I’m not that important. For instance I’m casually making dinner, I’m always thinking and it usually leads to “extravagant” things, and I convince myself that someone is watching me in the window. A common theme with me is death, and I know this thing watching me is going to kill me, I fully believe it, but I know it’s not there. It’s just hard to convince myself it’s not there because I don’t know, I can check but I convince myself it’s just hiding, I can go outside and look but I convince myself they’ll just leave and come back once I go back inside, or I’ll be shot if i show signs that I know they’re there. My instinct is to hide, I stop making dinner and I cower behind the cabinets away from any window. This sounds ridiculous, but I truly believe I’m going to die if I stay in sight. I have extremely high anxiety, and idk anyone that has as much as I do to the point of hiding in your own home. Idk if this is a compulsion, idk if I’m developing schizophrenia, idk if my intrusive thoughts are stronger and personalized because of DPDR, and quite frankly it’s hard to understand myself cause I can’t think too hard into why I am the way I am without depersonalizing.

Problems are also part of my personality after 30 years, losing them means losing part of myself. Finally, can't imagine a life without problems. This would be so unreal and I don't even know if I like it losing my problems. Hate them but can't let them go :(


I have a lot of problems. Reaching from minor to major ones, some of them are very similar some the opposite.

Today I tried to imagine how my new life should look like, so a life without all those problems and somehow that really scared me. It was really scarry for me that my problems would just be gone. Over 30 years they became part of my personality I think and somehow I am afraid because I lose a huge part of my ""personality"". 

I also tend to hide behind problems and disgnoses, when they are gone I simply lose my shelter where I could always hide..

I am for example afraid of dogs and some kind of food. It is just so unreal imagine losing this ""part of my personality""(problems), that drives me crazy.

I always wanted to lose my anxiety, etc.,
but at the same time losing all my anxiety and problems somehow makes me anxious.
I would just become so vulnerable without all those problems and diagnoses.

I am also really socially awkward etc. and if I imagine I wouldn't have that problem. I am like, WTF what kind of life should that be, where one can socialize with others without any fear, just totally relaxed conversations and having fun being with people.

67,"(Paragraph number 1&amp;2 are background info
Paragraph 3 is current, and a very slight summary.)

When we're born, we don't get to choose who's arms we're placed in. How can the one person who's supposed to protect you, fuck you up so much? Your mother is the first person you learn to trust, rely on, and even love. Why wasn't I important enough, why am I still not important enough, will I ever be? I keep waiting for my parents to be consistent in my life but they've never been anything more than in and out. The amount of control they have over my pain is devastating. There were years we didnt talk, years I fought with them, years I was abused by them but this mental abuse won't ever end, will it? They don't fucking care but cutting them off feels like hell too. I remember being a child, waking up in the middle of the night from bad dreams or even just being extremely ill to nobody being home. I still suffer from constant nightmares, when I actually manage to sleep. I remember being a child, getting yelled at for needing food since my father couldnt afford drugs and cigarettes because of me. I remember my parents having their addict friends in and out, I remeber an angry man pounding on the door, screaming about what he was owed. I remeber falling asleep to the fighting, I remeber getting a paper cut and being given a fuck ton of medications, I remeber moving in with my aunt and moving back in with my parents because all I wanted to do was protect the woman who never gave enough of a fuck to protect me, to choose me. The smell of cigarettes can send me into an overwhelming panic, I can't hold myself together at the slightest raise in somebody's time when they're angry.


Every day at school, had become another contsnt reminder that I was and am still worthless. I had to face people who hated me every day. No matter how many times I went to my peers , they never helped. They didnt believe me. Why would they? I was the new kid, always bouncing from school to school. All of those words that I had been called,  those things everybody called me, said to me or even about me built the rage inside of me. When I started Jr high, I  lost my grandfather. I didn't get to say goodbye to him. That It was an all time low for me. It lasted years, the next year is when I began to harm myself.  Nobody would help, the bullying wouldn't stop. I spent my youth from 4 until 15 unable to control my anger. The amount of times I lost my temper and freaked out at people and in front of people, still humiliate me. So much so, I still feel trapped by the angry and hurt child that I was. I'm so ashamed and guilty of my past that I fear success. The best long term experience of my life was my co op placement that I had during my last year of high school (2019) I made some of my best friends in the world, I finally felt loved and accepted but we aren't close now that I've gaduated and they no longer work their either. I guess we all drifted apart. During my time at my co op placement, I developed a very strong bond with one of the dogs there.  He was there for months on end due to his owners having to be gone to China for a while due to paperwork. The poor baby became so anxious, scared, he felt abandoned. I took constant care of him. We became best friends and I lost him too, once my placement came to an end and I graduated high school. My life began to spiral downwards again. It was a crisis for me, so much change at once. I survived high school, something I never thought I'd be able to do but it got harder from there.


This all leads me to now, I just failed my college course and have no idea what to do with my life. I'm falling apart and without student coverage can't afford my medication anymore. I never received a full diagnosis and I have a lot of issues with my physical health as well. The closest thing I have is a partial diagnosis of Bipolar disorder. I can't cope with the guilt I feel over every single mistake I've made during my existence, each one causing my a fear of success. I can't cope with waiting for my drug addict parents to love me, I can't cope with having no friends and failing to make any, I can't cope with the emptiness I feel from not having a single clue about what to do with my life and not feeling as if I have a purpose. The stress is so heavy and I'm not sure how much longer I can tolerate it. Throughout my life I've been nothing but depressed, suicidal, continuously dealing with self harm off and on. I've made multiple suicide attempts, having to go to school the next day with nobody knowing. I sat in front of teachers, falling asleep from the excessive amount of pills I downed the night before not wanted to or expecting to wake the next morning. I still wish I never did wake up.

68,"  I wrote this in a text doc as a vent to myself but after reading it over maybe some other people can relate to this and share their experiences

&amp;#x200B;

I think I have written about this topic before in a different context but I just had another terrible internal experience with it so I feel the need to write about it again. I’m not sure if this is due to my lifelong ADHD, my self-hatred issues, my social anxiety or perhaps an amalgam of all three, joining forces to turn into a superstorm of negativity but taking constructive criticism about myself is torture.

Since early teen years I have been an introspective person, constantly working to improve myself and get along better with others, its just one of the things that comes with being neurodivergent you notice very young you are unliked by most so you resolve to either change yourself or give up. I refused to give up.

So painstakingly over years and years of self-critique, introspection and improvement I have managed to mold myself into a far more patient, understanding and likeable person. Most of my friends respect and appreciate how honest and aware I am of others and most importantly how I can seemingly handle honest critique/feedback in a constructive manner. A friend could tell me “hey you did X and it was really annoying and made Y person uncomfortable” and outwardly I will be super apologetic and try to apologize and make amends with said person as soon as possible. The feedback I often get on this kind of behavior is “Wow I really appreciate that most people wouldn’t do that” or “thanks I know you are one of the few people I can have a conversation like this and it will go well”. Thing is I know what they mean, I appreciate it, I understand most people are not emotionally mature enough to handle a critique of their personality but…FUCK YOU I WANT TO BE IMMATURE! The whole time im having these conversations I feel that fucken child chained up inside me screaming and crying wanting to fight and ball my eyes out because my friends fucken hate my guts! I want to yell back and tell them to FUCK OFF they are being too sensitive or “WELL THAT’S THE WAY I AM DEAL WITH IT!”, I want to burst out crying and run away and not deal with it, but I can’t FUCKING DO THAT because it would completely destroy any friendships I have. And I hate that I only know this or feel this because they see me as emotionally mature enough to handle the conversation. Because sometimes I would rather just live my life without knowing every little thing people don’t like about me. I have worked so fucking hard to become a better person and its been almost impossible to balance the see-saw of helpful introspection and destructive self-hatred and situations like this push it over into the fucking deep end because it makes me think I have accomplished NOTHING, at 26 years old I’m still the same spazzy, annoying, ADHD child from my youth and people still secretly hate my guts but now a few are brave enough to tell you.

That’s one of the things I have noticed is very hard about being an emotionally resilient person (at least on the outside) is people feel safer coming to you with these kinds of things whereas with most people they would not bother…it means the stronger and better I get the more of this I have to take and I only hope it won’t keep making me hate myself.",30Apr2020,1
69,"I know this should be obvious. I mean I have a choice, right? Just stop if it makes you feel bad. (And it does, it really does, because all I really want is to be smart and classy and kind to be loved by a nice, nerdy guy who actually cares about me).

Still, over and over again, I feel compelled to post pictures of myself online, have rough sex with people I just met, talk dirty with strangers on reddit, or cam up for old men and strip. It’s not like I’m getting any sexual pleasure from it, either. i like the attention, and I like hearing that I’m beautiful when I’m feeling ugly. But that’s about it and it’s all very cliche and pathetic. Sometimes just feel so disgusted with myself. I feel tainted.

And sometimes, like right now, I feel so empty and subhuman, like a rag doll. I don’t know how to access the human spirit part of me sometimes. It’s like I’ve objectified myself more than any man has ever, and I don’t know what I can offer to anyone anymore besides a hole to blow his load into. I should volunteer or something.

72,"I know professional help is the answer, but I am also looking for anonymous, unprofessional opinions. 

As a brief background, I have had a long history of mental health issues: anxiety, depression, anorexia, bulimia, and a suicide attempt that left me on a ventilator. I don't really talk about it much and really don't want to provide more details about that. I also don't talk about what led up to it very often. It's all still pretty traumatic.

I won't do anything because I know it'll hurt my family, but every day I just want to be dead.

I've been told that I am so serious all the time. I can truly be a fun person at times, but people think I am just totally serious at all times. I hate that. It's mostly my constant worry and anxiety that makes me seem so serious. I really, really do want to be relaxed and have fun.

What I hate the most are these intense waves of panic I feel. I feel like I'm no longer myself, my brain is hyperactive, and my worry spins out of control. This has had a huge impact on my relationships. I worry and become so hyperfocused on a small issue. This also brings a great deal of anxiety on my SO. It's so bad. Coming down from it is like stopping a train in its tracks. I've had plenty of therapy and meds, but it's so bad. I know the breathing exercises. I know the distractions I need. It's still just bad.

This just happened to me tonight. Once I am able to calm down, I just feel this immense amount of guilt and embarrassment that I had to be so worried and make such a big deal about something so meaningless. When it happens, it's like I'm looking at my life on the outside. My vision is tunneled and I literally forget all logic and reason. I never resort to name-calling or personal attacks, it's just this weird hyperfocused mode on a specific, stupid issue. 

It keeps happening in cycles. And then I just feel guilty and worthless. I'm so sick of it. I feel like I'll just end up alone in the end. I understand I need professional help. I am not looking for that advice.

I just have no one else to talk to right now. My bf is turned off completely by my anxiety attack. He's just annoyed and told me to relax and not worry about every tiny detail in life. 

I feel like I'm just so weird when I have these waves of anxiety. I feel like I'm a different person when I'm anxious. When I'm calm, I just think, why tf did I need to worry about that for 3 hours straight.

74,"I am a person that has been dealing with OCD since I was around 7 that progressively got worse (I am now 18.)
My OCD largely affects my hand-washing more than anything. So far all these years, hand washing for me was a process of washing your hand till your brain gave you the signal that you’re good to go (about 3-5 times). If I stopped washing before the signal, I would just feel seriously anxious, which is basically what OCD is.
But for the last 10 days or so my brain doesn’t give that signal anymore, and even after washing 6-8 times it doesn’t feel any different. Now it is just my brain short-circuiting serious anxiousness that really doesn’t let me function. For the last 2 days I’ve had serious headaches and I believe anxiety is the reason.
I’m well familiar with meditation and “mindfulness”, and those two were usually the things that I’d turn to when I was going through something. But I seriously can’t calm my brain down, I’m constantly anxious and I don’t even think it’s about the hands anymore. Just no matter what I do, sit in the dark, try to meditate, try to sleep, my mind feels like it’s frying itself. 
The fact that these are serious times and pandemic and whatnot has been causing the distress would be a good answer, but honestly I was thrilled about lockdown, I have a list of books that I was hyped to go through, but I can’t even focus on that anymore.

The worst part is that I’d gotten so used to the feeling that I don’t always realize that it’s a problem. It feels like I spent more time during my past relationship having a mild to severe panic attack than not, so that’s just my new normal. I recently told my friends all of this and they haven’t been coming to me with their problems as much anymore. I don’t know if this is PTSD that I’m experiencing or what. My therapist has said she thinks I definitely have trauma from what happened, but we’ve never talked about the possibility of me having PTSD, so I don’t want to say that’s what it is, but it’s definitely anxiety and panic attacks caused by past trauma.",30Apr2020,1

78,"After six weeks of government enforced solitary confinement in New Zealand with no physical human contact, I now understand why people cut.

At night, when laying in the bath, I've started giving myself little cuts with a shaving razor. The focus of the pain and the trickle of blood remind me that I'm alive, that I'm real.

Otherwise, the rest of the time, I feel like nothing is real.

During the day, I'm working from home. Are the projected faces of my team members and friends on Zoom real, or are they characters in a Netflix series running on my laptop? Is the work I'm doing real? Are the other people in my organisation that I'm e-mailing real or just craftily engineered chatbots? I watch our health authorities give their Covid-19 update every 1pm. Are they real, or part of the same TV show? Covid-19 doesn't feel real. Nobody I know has had it. I gaze out my window. Sometimes a few essential workers pass by in the distance, but too far away for me to get a good look at. Are they real or mirages and out-of-focus shades in some unwelcome walking dream that I'm trapped in? Have I been in a car accident? Am I stuck in a coma? 

Do you ever feel like you're in a play? Except you're the only one that knows it's a play? And everyone is just playing the role they think they're supposed to play, because that's what you do? And you're like, ""Hey, this is just a play. We don't have to do this."" And maybe we shouldn't.

While in a Zoom call, I have the urge now sometimes to blurt out something absolutely outrageous and socially inappropriate. Just to see if people will react. Or will they not even notice I exist, because this is all just a dream? 

Cutting helps. The pain; the icy tingle of the razor biting in, and the warmth of the crimson ruby blood washing down my body afterwards; the heady rush of the adrenalin and endorphins of my body's damage control systems coming to my defense; jolts me out of my dream, jolts me out of catatonia and coma and reminds me I'm alive.

Self harm really is addicting. I never thought I’d fall into it but I did. And once you try it it’s hard to stop, because when you get injured your brain releases endorphins. Basically like a drug. So relapsing isn’t really great for me, because I’ll see it like “oh I already fucked up being clean, there’s nothing stopping me from cutting more”.

I am looking for a book, not really motivational, but something to help me with mental health. To get me understand why this is happening in my brain, how to get it under control and all in all just get me some kind of help since therapy is not an option to me right now.

I'm just confused why some things I have none of, but the other things are extremely high (symptoms) I hate it.",30Apr2020,1
83,"A bit of background: Diagnosed with panic disorder at 13, depression and generalized anxiety disorder at 14, went on to develop psychotic depression, OCD, social anxiety disorder, and now I'm 24 and still have these problems except the psychosis has gradually faded away. Hospitalized 6 times in the psych wards due to either suicidal thoughts, homicidal thoughts, or suicide attempts. Tried so many medications I've lost count but I'm on 3 right now that work well. I was also recently diagnosed with autism.

So here's the thing: I've been doing better. I used to really, really suffer with this stuff. High school was a big trigger. When I graduated, I had no plans and that was scary, but I started stumbling through adult life and it felt a lot better to not be in high school anymore. I had a great relationship that ended awfully (lost my ex and all my friends in the process) and now I'm in a fantastic relationship and I'm engaged. I still live with my parents, and they're either great to live with or completely awful and unsafe to live with. Like flipping a switch, I swear.

I have very few panic attacks. I have very few major depressive episodes. My OCD is still an issue but it's always been on the milder side. Struggling with autism...well, I've been doing that subconsciously for all my life, but it's definitely a new problem that I'm learning to deal with. People scare me but I used to refuse visiting places like shopping malls and concerts, now I jump at the opportunities.

So if I'm doing so well...why do I feel so mentally drained, fatigued, and just...dead inside? I can be happy but I have no motivation, no willpower, no energy to do things that I need to get done or even want to do. I let my laundry pile up into a mountain and my room become a mess and I end up hating myself for it all because I can't bring myself to just ""do"" it. I don't cook food and I don't grocery shop and now my appetite is strictly for junk food and I'm lucky if I eat 1000 calories a day. So now I'm gradually losing weight, too, about 20 lbs over the past year.

It's like I'm better, but I'm not. I feel like I'm stuck in a pile of wet cement. Is it executive functioning? I can sort of relate to issues with that. I can sit around and stare at my phone for hours and hours, stay up late for hours and hours, but as soon as I tell myself to do laundry or clean my room or get ready for bed, even little things like brushing my teeth or taking a shower or eating a bowl of cereal...I can tell myself to do these things hundreds of times over and try to justify to myself why it's important to do but I just...can't? Don't? Won't? What am I supposed to do in this situation? The only time I don't feel like this is when I pump myself full of energy drinks but I know it's easy to build a tolerance to those so I don't do that often.

I do work, but less than 20 hours a week, and I'm able to make myself go because it's really easy, monotonous work, but I find myself dreading it even more if I have to do something more strenuous than normal.

Am I lazy? Or am I just depressed but no longer to the point of psychosis and suicide? I don't get it...I feel like a failure in life. It feels like my brain has slowly rotted away and I no longer can do normal people things.",30Apr2020,1
84,"I have previously been diagnosed with depression around 4 years ago.  I had a good GP and got the help I needed that really made a difference and helped me recover.

Recently I have been feeling a little lacklustre but have put it down to isolation/social distancing etc. One of my hobbies is gaming and last week I joined an online community and had a tryout for one of their teams, which I was turned down for.

I know it is utterly irrational but I have been so upset by this to the point that its now disturbing my sleep. I feel humiliated and I honestly don't understand why I'm reacting this way.  No one was unpleasant to me, I simply didn't get what I was hoping for and I feel so childish for this reaction.  I know I'm overreacting but I don't know why.

86,"Ever since I was little, I had this constant urge to count things. I didn’t do it all the time, but times when I was feeling extremely emotional (happy, sad, stressed, worried, bored, etc). While in the car, I was so bored I would count everything that passed whether it was a car or a tree or a sign, I had to count it. Not only that, but I had to count a certain number of things before I felt satisfied. For ex, I had to count to numbers that were ending with 5 or 0, if it was not ending with those numbers but we had made it to our destination so there was nothing left for me to count, I would count random things in the car to get to a “nice” number before I could get out and do anything else.

Another incident that happened often was when I would run on my treadmill. To get my mind off of feeling tired and sore, I would start to count all of the little buttons on the photo albums my mom had that was directly in front of the treadmill. Not only that, but I would count all of the photo albums themselves as well. I would repeat the numbers (only 9 photo albums but one photo album was shaped differently and looks like two smaller albums, so I always count it as two so I would get to 10, which was a nice number) and 25 exact buttons. I would repeat the counting process in my head over and over and over again until I finished running.

Once I got into high school, I would constantly count the things in my classrooms if I was bored. If I was extremely happy about something, I would count things to calm me down. And when I gained a little weight, I became obsessive over calories and numbers in a different way. This obsession fueled my anorexia and counting soon became something harmless to harmful.

Counting numbers became a way for me to cope with things, I guess. But it felt too silly to bring it up as an actual problem, because it’s wasn’t something that harmed me or anyone else before I had my ed. When I brought it up with my doctor, he said it’s normal to be obsessive over numbers when having an ed, but what about all of the counting before I even knew what an ed was? Before I was even aware that my counting was something no one else did? Did my counting set me up suffer from anorexia or is it something that’s truly harmless and has no correlation with my ed.

Why is it that I count everything? Do other people count things and see things the way I do? When I count things nothing goes on in my head, the numbers don’t look different or turn into objects or anything like that, but it still always bothers me that I can’t find an answer as to why this happens. Hopefully by posting here, I can reach people who may understand what’s happening with me.",30Apr2020,1

Since the moment I started dating my bf she always said that ”my brothers gf have to be close friends with or else I wont accept them as my brothers gf” because we are all asians thats how it appereantly is family comes first in every sitiation and they butt in, in everything.

She has 2 brothers. I remember when I started dating her brother. The other brother also had a thing with this one girl that is in the same dance group. And the ”friend” would always go on and on about how every gf of her brothers has to be close friends with her. 

Me,I’m the kind of a person who is bad at saying no, but there were several times I was brave enough to say ”no” to her, but it wasn’t worth it AT ALL! She doesn’t take no as the answer. She will remember that I said no this one time and she will use it later to make me feel like I’ m the monster.

Today is my 24th birthday. I normally live at home with my family but I've had to move out for their safety. I haven't seen any family or friends in 2 months now.

I rang in my 24th today in a room with a baby suspected for COVID-19 who was very sick. I was holding the baby while the doctor was doing a lumbar puncture. Wearing the same mask I've been wearing all day and full gown, face shields, gloves.

I could feel my phone vibrating with messages from friends/family. I'm not even an emotional person but I just started crying silently. Everyone was so concentrated that no one noticed. I went to the back after and spent 20 mins having a good cry while listening to the stable song from BOTW (LOL).

I wasn't sad about working on my birthday, having to wear sweaty PPE all day or even having to deal with a sick baby (I deal with them all the time). I think I was just so overwhelmed the last few weeks and this was the first time I let my emotions out.

Fast forward to last year, right after my 18th birthday. Due to complications with my dad's job, we had to move states in late May. I was absolutely devastated and begged my parents not to move; alas, they used the ""it's this or we go bankrupt"" card. I eventually just went along with it. 

This past year has been an absolute shitshow, to say the least. I tried to find the good in living here, but just made myself hate it more in the long run. My depression and anxiety have gotten bad again since, and I've gotten progressively more angry towards my parents. Which I feel awful for.

However, a few months ago, they came to the realization that they too were miserable living here. So, after many difficulties involving the house (corona has really messed up the market), we learned today that it is under contract. I'm thrilled! Yet, at the same time.. am not.

I thought I would be ecstatic about finally getting to go back to where I'm happy. I've surprisingly felt nothing, though. I think I've gotten so used to the situation and things going wrong that I've become kind of emotionless.

94,"I have been in the mental health system for many years starting with the breakup of a girlfriend, going to college, and the crumbling of my fundamentalist evangelical belief system. I've had no clue how to navigate emergent adulthood, and while I voluntarily began seeking mental health treatment, over time I have been very repulsed by the mental health field.

In short, I believe that the mental health system is an extension of the state designed to reduce class consciousness by subduing biological systems which normally facilitate awareness. By abstracting out social or financial issues people are facing to a ""medical problem,"" then repression or distraction become justified solutions to people in crises.

They get people in there with catch-all diagnoses like ""unspecified bipolar disorder"" and feed people neuroleptics. The psych wards are full of veterans and rebellious kids whose parents just put them in there as a low key form of unaccountable incarceration. They feed people neuroleptics as first line treatments like latuda.

I've tried every class and kind of medication and therapy type and at no point did people begin to realize that maybe things like a stable living and work arrangement, to be around intelligent peers who are good influences, relevant mentorship, the ability to make effective use of interests skills and abilities in a constructive way, the ability to express and receive sexual reciprocation, intimacy, fair pay, and the ability to form and build reasonable schedules and routines were actually important.

Like you can be deprived of the ability to have these things or have no clue how to achieve them, and at no point in the mental health system will they recognize that things outside of yourself actually might be the cause of the issues, but instead it's all within you and to be fixed by the way you think about things. They told me they aren't allowed to give advice (only empty platitudes?). It feels really really like a scam. 

Like one time after trying basically all the meds and just saying they didn't work I was told that I have to ""believe in them working for them to work."" So basically an objective trial of the medications are not adequate. You have to believe them to work for them to work. Then when you are just honest they aren't working at no point does anyone think that actually maybe it isn't a medical problem after all, they just give you passive aggressive looks as though you have done something wrong by just being honest about it and there is always an endless list of other pills you haven't taken but have slightly different mechanisms of action.

Like they give me one ssri, an maoi, a dri, an nri, it's like yeah I know how all of these things effect me, excuse me for being a little skeptical? Like okay I had a few ssris and i know the general feeling. Then they are like, hey take another one you can't really say it will work or not because it's a different chemical. It's like and I'm not wrong every time - I take it and the same predictable response is there.

The field feels really dishonest. It sort of feels like the place they put people who have fallen through the cracks in life to brainwashing them into thinking they are fine. It makes people end up like in a zombielike state like its sort of a fake complacency. I've been in the system for 7 years and it has been socially damaging because it undermines your credibility and then family latch onto it like delegitimizing any real concerns I have because it's not real, it's just a ""mental"" problem. Like you don't need a decent job, intelligent peers, or mentorship, it's really just your outlook, how you think and respond. It's completely ridiculous and removes the responsibility other people have in social and economic dynamics by isolating the ""patient.""

And you aren't allowed to criticize it either, because everybody is on the bandwagon that in doing so you are ""discouraging people from getting help"" and ""you aren't a doctor."" I was told really contradictory things like ""your problem is that you are too busy trying to fix everybody else you aren't fixing yourself"" and ""you are only thinking about yourself and not anybody else."" When it comes to relationships, it's also weird, like I thought that expressing sexuality was also a need people had? In the mental health system they think it's not really needed and is like a luxury only (even though I know many LGBT people who become suicidal in environments where they feel deprived of it). Like and they think just ""self exploration"" is adequate? It's not. 

The problem is that with the mental health system, there is no baseline, or they set the baseline so low that it's like you can be a slave eunuch and if you aren't fine with that then you have a mental problem.",30Apr2020,1

So I posted through another account on a different sub about how I got my pets to help with my mental health but there were one or two particular situations that I found stressful and I asked for advice on how to deal with these situations and make my pets more comfortable. I made it clear I only wanted advice on how to make my pets more comfortable. But, people being people, there were one or two comments along the lines of ‘you’re relying too heavily on your pets for your mental health’ to which I responded saying that that wasn’t a fair assumption as they couldn’t possibly have the whole picture. One of these threads ended up with us coming to terms and understand what the other was meaning. The other person insisted I was being defensive and confrontational (how you can be both I don’t know) and that I couldn’t take advice. I asked them not to make judgements as they didn’t know all the facts and they insisted they weren’t being judgemental, just offering advice - a judgement is drawing a conclusion from the evidence before you. They literally made a judgement.

Anyway, this second person continued along the same lines and ended by saying ‘seek therapy’. This made me really angry because I was trying (civilly I might add) to ask them not to make assumptions about me or my mental state and they continued to do so and basically ignored the fact that I was trying to get help with something else, that would help my mental health!!! And also, they have no idea whether or not I am seeking medical or therapeutical help, so for them to say that shows me that they don’t have any understanding of people in crisis and how to talk to them. 

I know people on the internet can’t possibly understand the full extent of anything you write, but when you’re explicitly asking someone to stop judging you I don’t understand why they would continue to do so.

99,"I have been struggling with depression for about 10 years of my life now (im 19) due to childhood trauma and extremely twisted views of life. My friend recommended meditation and mindfulness videos to me, as I had a few nights prior relapsed to self-harm (i have been clean for over 4 years). I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBFEqDRMi-0) and started meditating. After thinking about my feelings and getting really deep into why i was feeling the way i am, i saw something that truly changed my whole mindset now.  (i have been in therapy for about 6 years of my life, tried several antidepressants and nothing seemed to help me, even my own therapist told me there's a high chance that i would never get better which made me believe i could not move on)

I imagined my childself (as a symbol for my trauma, depression and childhood) screaming under water, with no one being able to hear her. Then my ""higher self"" or really just my current self came to help her and spent time with her. I then had a very heartfelt conversation about her needing to let go, as it is my time to take control of myself and my life now. She accepted it, i told her i loved her no matter what and that i understood why she felt the way she did. I then put her to sleep and continued with telling myself how loved i am, how much i matter etc. basically a lot of self-love.

And now for the first time ever, as i was thinking of my life this morning, i didn't feel sadness, i didn't feel angry, i was able to just accept my life as it is, because that is what shaped me into the way i am now. I also stared at myself in the mirror and just felt pure love towards myself. It feels increadible to say that i now truly believe i have a chance to a normal life.

Hey all, im an 18 y/o male, diagnosed depression and anxiety (that is p much under control for the time being). However I have a super low libido and haven't watched porn for like 3 years. But I guess I got super worried about the following situation.

So basically the video itself is pretty tame, theres no explicit imagery or whatever either and in fact I had no idea it could be any form of hypno until I checked the comments after the video. The channel is a kinda avant-garde art channel, in that he creates videos as art (and also does some perversely funny book reviews). So when it said to stare at the centre of the screen, I obliged for the entirety of the flashing logo up until about 0.50.  

I felt kinda odd after watching it, kind of light headed, like something inside my brain had been messed with. Im not sure whether it was just bc the flashing stuff kinda stunned me or because of something more insidious... There weren't any lewd images, just black and white panels flashing.

Then I checked the comments, where several ppl either insinuated or straight out said it was sissy hypno, or supposed to make you gay, whatever. If you want to you can go see the comments for yourself.. Now, I dont know if it is or not, or if it works, etc but it freaked me out big time. This was all about 1.5 hours ago.

Right now, Im not sure if I like my massive crush anymore, as in I cannot for the life of me tell if I like her anymore or not when I look at pictures of her. Im just as worried that it has 'turned off' or 'reset' my attraction to her as I am about the sissy/gay part, which would suck cos we have a really great relationship formed over a good 2 years. I dont know if this is due to me worrying, a placebo of some sort or bc it is legit. I really care about her and she is kinda the reason I pull through, so it'd be awful if I had no drive to be with her anymore.

is there any way I can reverse it if it is a thing?? Is it actually hypno or is it just shitposting? Can anyone tell me the extent of this? Does it wear off??

If you need any more details please feel free to ask me.

For good reason, many organizations have issued guidelines to combat the stress of a coronavirus pandemic. Things feel pretty real at the moment, and many of us are being asked to lodge in our homes, restrict our travel and social contacts. One of the most important weapons we have to fight the virus is our mental health, and the general concerns people have as they digest the news from around the world here at home are likely to take a heavy toll. 

For many people living with mental health problems, the current situation will only exacerbate and exacerbate symptoms, so it is important to take extra care to ensure more support and self-help for mental well-being. While countries take the necessary steps to ensure everyone's safety by adopting these tips and tools, they should ensure that they also take care of their own mental health during this time. 

Here are some mental health practices that make it easier to continue during the lockdown, starting with the most common mental illnesses, such as depression, anxiety and substance abuse. 

If you have an appointment with a psychologist or psychiatrist, you may want to cancel it. If you need to behave yourself because your immune system is compromised or you are worried, talk to your doctor right away. 

I have already done a good deal of work to look after my mental health, but I am facing a somewhat stressful time from anxiety and mental health standpoint. 

If you find it depressing, Dr. Gertrude, a psychiatrist at the [University of California](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu), San Francisco, has given some top tips on how to deal with it. Her advice included planning activities to help you stay on your toes, get your old address book, call old friends and get exercise to give you a break from the people in your life. I will tell you that the coronavirus is really what someone is talking about, isn't it? 

It can be a coping mechanism for dealing with emotional stress, any kind of stress and a way to bring the situation under control. Many people are affected by the closure, but others are coping well and there are coping mechanisms. When you have recovered from a binge eating disorder, it is triggered by stress or anxiety that can make you feel things are out of control. 

There are things you can do to deal with it, but there's no need to feel guilty, it's not your fault and it's not your fault. 

If your situation is frustrating, there are things you can do to make your time at home enjoyable, take care of your mental health and copy the tips below on how to stay positive and relaxed during the lockout period. It may not seem like a long time, but staying away from family and friends for so long will be tough for everyone, and tough measures could hit many people's mental health hard.  

While it is important to stay informed, there are also many things you can do to support and manage your well-being at such times. Staying active not only keeps your body moving, but also helps to reduce stress, increase energy levels, and keep you awake. 

Spend more time at home as many of your regular social activities will no longer be available. The government tells you to go and wash your hands as soon as you get home, but if you stay home You have to do it at least once a day. 

When schools are closed and many people have to work from home or are asked to stay at home, it can feel as if everything is over. 

In fact, it is much better for everyone's mental health to try to keep the routine going as much as possible. The reason for this is not only that routines are maintained, but also in the overload and exhaustion that can come with too many options. It releases mental bandwidth at a time of uncertainty that is already straining their cognitive abilities.

During this quarantine it’s got much worse but I’ve always felt it. It’s like I’m so used to doing things by the book and working through assignments that when I have my own free time I can never relax in the fear that I should be using that time wisely. 
The reason I know this is wrong is because I DO use my time wisely. I wake up at 8am, eat healthy, exercise every day then after 1pm I’ve got my own time. But I just can’t. I’ll sit down to play video games but it’s like I’m slipping behind my peers in this invisible race. I hate it. 

I have creative outlets, for example I drum, and I like to think I make music but I don’t do it often. Maybe I should focus on that? I don’t know. I guess I’m just posting to see if anyone feels the same sometimes.",30Apr2020,1
108,"Honestly I feel like I've been struggling with mental health for a few years now but I've tried to block it out and carry on like normal. I feel like I've just reached my limit where I can't take anymore. I've got such a negative association with how I look, and I'm having problems with feeling comfortable when eating. I've been focusing on how I look so much that it's made me so miserable and I've not been focusing on uni work very well. I'm struggling to concentrate now, nothing will go in and I've got exams in 2 weeks time. 
Yesterday is where I felt tipped over the edge. I was just chilling on the sofa with my boyfriend and we were talking about PewDiePie. My boyfriend said he was jealous of Felix's life and I asked why. He responded with ""He's so lucky because he's married to an Italian model"" and honestly that just broke me. I told him that it upset me and he said he was joking but I just can't stop thinking about it. I'm not exactly a small girl so this comment really upset me. Now I'm literally too scared to eat or drink anything as I don't want to gain weight. I'm sorry this post is all over the show but I just wanted to rant. I know this was a very small comment that he said he was joking with, but my boyfriend really hurt my and I literally can't stop thinking about those words he said.",30Apr2020,1
109,"So last night was like every other night right? Started off that way. Something didn’t seem right to me. I felt really anxious, I kept smoking to keep myself cool. But it eventually didn’t work anymore. I was thinking about my ex friends who ditched me, harassed me, threatened my life multiple times, and how no one cared, felt so fucking helpless, how I feel like I’m always tossed away like garbage. I started rocking back and forth almost violently in my chair, breathing heavy. I couldn’t think straight, I don’t really remember what I was thinking. I just remember what has happening to me, I started smoking again to see if it can cool me down and make me stop. 

This lasted 3 to 5 minutes. I sorta paced around my house for a few too. Started listening to music like nothing happened. I don’t know what was going through my head but I feel like my mind was just trying to stop myself from a super depressive state. Idk people might say it’s dissociating as I have bpd. But I’ve never had something that drastic happen to me before. 

I feel better but I’ve been up all night. I’ve been feeling really empty. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. This is new to me, should I talk to someone about this?",30Apr2020,1

111,"Before I get into it, I'm genuinely looking for any advice I can and didn't know where to go so I came to this subreddit. I need to tell someone but no one seems to care in my personal life. If you don't want to read a lengthy amount of text,  then keep scrolling but anyone willing to help me it's more appreciated than you think just please be patient with me, I'm not the best at writing and I'm not in the right state of mind. I'm a 17 year old male, for reference.

My dad had a horrible childhood. I won't get into details but just to give you an idea he got kidnapped when he was 3, he's been held at gunpoint as a kid, been bullied, jumped, stabbed, you name it. His parents were primarily absent and he had to fend for himself.

Fast forward to now. He made the best out of his life and married my mom, and had me and my older brother, along with getting a good job. One thing that hasn't left him is his temper. And I don't mean your average yelling in an argument. It's so easy to push his buttons that if you say the wrong thing he gets hot headed and SCREAMS. 

Now if there's any other people that have experienced this reading, he's the type of parent that says anything you do is attitude, even if I'm simply feeling down and have a frown on my face. I have to fake my entire personality around him due to this, and it's been like this since I was a young kid.

It's so hard to explain everything about him but I'll do my best. He drinks nearly every night. Not necessarily in excess, but I think it's enough to consider him an alcoholic as he makes multiple rum and cokes a night and claims it to help his pain in his body which I saw BS from a young age. Anyways, this makes his temper even more fragile.

When it first started to affect me was when I was 8. He got in financial arguments with my mom and that led to more of a personal argument and a lot of yelling. I remember my mom cooking dinner for me and my brother whilst balling her eyes out due to my dad unleashing on her verbally. 

Keep in mind he's never physically abused me. I've asked my mom if he's physically abused her and she said no, which I believe.

I've took health classes. I KNOW that physical abuse isn't the only form that can put a toll on a kid, significant other, etc. I KNOW I've been consistently verbally and mentally abused throughout my childhood and as I get older it's beginning to reflect in me and affect me more.

I can't sit here and tell you every story as there is too many I can remember and they're all blurs to me, so I'll tell you what happened today so you can see what I'm talking about.

I went downstairs and my mom and dad were sitting on the couch watching TV. It was a peaceful night at first and my dad seemed to be in a good mood. He got up to make popcorn. I was going to make a protein shake as I've been working out a lot in quarantine to try to boost my morale. I'm a really precise person and like to measure out ingredients perfectly, not eyeball them. I went to the drawer and was looking for what I needed. My dad stared at me and asked what I was measuring. I told him vanilla extract, a quarter teaspoon to be precise, as it adds flavor to my shake that doesn't taste the greatest. He says ""why the fuck do you need that? Just another thing we'll run out of that costs money to stock up on."" He went back to the couch from the kitchen. I told him it's a small amount and won't out that much of dent into the huge bottle that costs SIX DOLLARS. I've been using it daily and haven't noticed a difference in the bottle. And keep in mind we're a middle class family and having to pay for that isn't a big deal considering how much stuff my dad blows money on.

Anyway, we continue to argue somewhat peacefully until he continues to tell me not to use it. So I comply and tell him ""okay i won't use it I'm sure it'll taste fine anyway"" in a normal tone, and not being a smart ass. I was being truthful, I can handle the taste. He all of a sudden lost it and  went off the topic completely about how I never clean the dished thoroughly and a bunch of other random crap. Again he'll do anything to make me look bad even if it isn't related to the subject.

I argued back in a normal tone whilst he was rasing his voice. He calls this attitude and disrespectful. I told him this isn't worth arguing over. He lost it. Went on and on about how shitty of a kid I am and how little I do, and when I tried interrupting and standing my ground he yelled ""SHUT THE FUCK UP AND LISTEN TO ME"" and at this point in my life I'm done putting up with his verbal torment and letting him step on me. I still, in a normal voice told him I'm gonna stand my ground and don't think what he's saying is true. He starts point out more random, false speculations about me. 

I deny what he's saying and say he's over reacting and EVERYTIME I talked he yelled at me to shut the fuck up. At this point, he has the look of pure hatred and anger in his eyes, which I've grown used to when he gets like this. It looks like he wants to come over and hurt me. So I finally stay quiet and comply, and for minutes he continues to chew me out at the top of his lungs. I told him to stop yelling and to let it go.

Keep in mind my mom was just sitting there staying quiet as she knows it's best not to provoke him anymore.

He got up off the couch and said ""OH THATS FUCKING IT I'VE HAD ENOUGH"" and balled up his fist, and came over to the kitchen. We have an island in the middle of our kitchen thank god, which kept his distance from me. His face was bright red and god when I saw screaming, this is the loudest he's ever yelled at me and that's saying something. He kept trying to chase me around the island to quote on quote ""teach me the hard way to be the fuck quiet."" My mom thankfully jumped in and stepped in front of him and told him he's overreacting. Still yelling. Luckily didn't push my mom or anything. He slammed his fist on the counter so hard it looked like it would've hurt.

I had enough and was shaking throughout my body in fear. I'm legit scared of this side of him and fear him. I yelled ""STOP"" multiple times and started to cry but I held it back. He went back to the couch and tried yelling again and me and my mom both just told him to stop. 

I wanted to make him think I'm not afraid of him so i stayed downstairs and finished my shake, and took it upstairs. When I went up I heard him slam his hand on the table followed by a bunch of cuss words regarding me. I went upstairs still trembling in fear and actually felt the need to lock my door. 

I sat in my room for 30 minutes. I went out to eavesdrop on what he was telling my mom. He was ""calm"" by now and was telling my mom some shitty things about me. He was saying how me and my brother have no self confidence unlike him when he was a child, and some other random things that hurt. Funny how he thought I couldn't hear him. He then went on to say to my mom how if I wanna take out my anger to put on the boxing gloves and he'll let me get a few punches before he beats the living shit out of me. 

I stopped eavesdropping because honestly I couldn't take it anymore. Haven't talked to him since and we're in the same house, although my mom came up to my room to try to comfort me. She wanted me to talk to him but it's WAY to early for him to expect me to sit down and talk.

I would talk to him if he heard me out, listened to what I have to say for once. He always dominates conversations and interrupts as if what I'm saying isn't important and his words are so much wiser. EVEN WHEN ITS A CASUAL CONVERSATION(i.e. about school, sports, people). I just can't be myself. I can't put a word in any form without it being called disrespectful. And he will literally interrupt my thoughts telling me to let HIM get a word in. Might as well glue my fucking mouth shut as my words have no value, and since he's my dad his actions, words, and everything are justified and if I don't agree I don't understand how the world works. 

He has a good side. We used to do fun things together like fishing. But he is always breathing down my neck and nowadays he wonders why I don't spend time with him. Maybe because he's trained my brain from a young age to fear my own fucking dad? I don't think his past is an excuse for any of this. 

This is one occasion of numerous, and probably the closest to him physically abusing me. 

I don't know who to talk to. Anyone I've told tells me I'm a pussy and everyone's parents are like that. Or that other people have it worse and to stop being an attention whore. Okay, fine. I've stopped talking about my problems and now with no one that understands me I feel lost, I feel a deep deep pain that I just want to go away. It makes me cry when I even think about how fucking dysfunctional my family is. My brother is slightly autistic and he never talks to me. But I love him. He's been bullied a lot too. That makes me sad. The only way I am ""happy"" is when i block out those thoughts and put on my fake personality. But that isn't happiness it's being numb. I can't keep living like this. I can't call the cops over verbal abuse. I can't get a therapist because my dad strongly believes verbal abuse isn't a thing and I'm being a little pussy because he went through so much worse so I shouldn't ever get depressed. Little does he know I've been in malicious fights with people, I've got into drinking, smoking and vaping because of my anxiety and stress even though I know it isn't good. He doesn't know how people at school treat me like shit and have from a young age. He doesn't know that I've been blackout drunk and left to drown in my own puke by my so called friends. He doesn't know I've been lead on by every girl I've been interested in, and been called an ugly fuck behind my back by those girls. My whole life is a secret to him because I'm still a straight A student and have learned how to get around being caught.

He's just fucking stupid when it comes to mental health but I can't tell him. I can't tell him that how I feel because he'll argue with me that I'm wrong. I'm always wrong. There's more I want to say but I've been typing this long enough and I cant cover it all. All I know is that I can't take much more of this mental torment. People say move out once I'm 18 but I don't want to just leave my mom. I love her to death. And crazy part is at the end of the day part of me still loves my dad despite making my life a living hell. I don't know why I'm even posting this here or trying, I doubt I'll get many responses but I just want a normal life. I want to be happy and I try so hard but I have constant reminders I can't be.",30Apr2020,1

It's just whenever I'm around them, I get annoyed by everything they do, the constant talking and questioning, the constant screaming and all the racket they make. It annoys be to the point where my hands start itching.
Well not all kids tho, some are really obedient and sweet, they always listen and do as you say. 

I actually hate loud people, like I hate too much noise.

113,"I'm 25F. I’m not really sure when this started, but it was approximately one and a half years ago. Sometimes I feel weird, like I am in a “blah” mood. It’s hard to describe, but I don’t really feel like doing anything or having a conversation with anyone. I also have trouble focusing on anything (also focusing on a normal conversation sometimes) and get annoyed more easily. It’s an unpleasant feeling that I can’t classify. When it happens, people notice and ask me if sth is up, and that I look “very serious”. Sometimes it also feels like moving in general feels harder to do, like something is pulling me down and makes it harder to move. This has happened several times when I was sitting in the library and wanted to go home, I had to wait for the weird feeling to go away before I could go home. It feels a bit like I am drunk, except that it’s not fun. 

There are some days where it gets more intense and it feels really disgusting. On those days, I sometimes find it hard to leave my bed or take a shower, and I just feel like laying in bed all day. I had that yesterday, starting at around 11 am. I felt so bad (mentally) that it was physical too. 

I realize that it gets worse when I have tests, exams or other stressful events. I’ve dealt with multiple mental health problems in the past 3 years and I’m a university senior, so everything is pretty stressful right now. I also realized over the last months that my emotions are “deteriorating” and it feels like I hardly have emotions anymore. Things I normally get emotional about (i.e. graduating college) don’t cause any emotions at all and I just feel like “blah”, as described above. 

I also noticed that I mostly feel this way in the afternoon time (around 4 pm), but sometimes it also happens earlier in the day ( like yesterday) and that it happens more frequently in winter when it's dark all the time.

I'm literally blocking myself from living. I want to control everything, and not just everything in my life, but everything that exists... It's crazy. I can't live with the fact that I know that I don't know. That we don't know anything. You know, for example, the fact that we don't know what's after death, that we don't know if there are parallel universes. What if we wake up everyday in a different universe? But at the same time, if we do wake up in another universe, why do our relatives and generally people stay dead (if they're already dead) or something?

Even though at times that I wasn't at fault. All I've ever done everytime this happens was just shut up, and accept whatever they say. I don't stand a chance because I thought they were always right and were just doing it for my sake. So I just kept my anger to myself and blamed it on me because there was no one else to blame. I vent in all my anger, I feel like screaming but I can't, I've thought of self-harming and done it several times. I can't even put what I feel in words because of how frustrated I am now.

My ex and I are together again after many times that I have panicked and ended things. I’m at a point that I cannot see myself being with someone long term or having children and that feeling only seems to grow as it has for years.

So I've never really suffered from any mental health issues before however during this lockdown, I've been finding myself getting feelings of deja vu.

But it's not just that, this feeling then causes me to get lightheaded and nearly pass out, causing me to sit down and breathe slowly just to get rid of it. Another time, last week, I was sat at my computer and just got the same feeling. 

I'm generally a super positive person who never moans, but this is horrible and just want to know if any others have experienced the same?

Is happiness even real or is it just people people exaggerating the fact that they feel fine? Is it just an unobtainable goal that people strive for in life? Is happiness just being distracted from the horribly abusive prison that is our minds? Maybe it's the ignorance of the atrocities that are being committed on this earth. Perhaps it's completely forgetting the fact that our existence is utterly meaningless. That our purpose is to reproduce and continue our species for no good discernable reason? Happiness is just a myth. Everyone is trying to achieve happiness not realising they'll never achieve it. We'll reproduce in hopes our children will live happy lives creating a happy and better future. We'll reproduce in the hopes that raising a child will bring us a sense of happiness.

125,"I'm going to attempt to write this as small as possible 
Something very traumatic happened to me in 2015 I tried to kill myself and to me, my life ended then and there when I went into hospital for those months. Everything about myself froze. I wasn't the same person any longer and I was stuck in limbo. 
I was in my last years of school but I was doing a bridge course at a university doing Outdoor ed where we learned to surf /environmental issues/kayak etc. 
I finished the course for that year when I left my town to go into a psych ward . I left everything behind me within those moments alone in my room.

First let’s put things into perspective, if you buy a new computer and turn it on the built-in ***operating system*** prepares it to work. But if there are no programs in that computer it really can’t do anything.

Let’s compare that to a child. When the brain develops its got an ***operating system***. But there are no programs, so nature created the first seven years of Our Lives to download behaviors by observing our parents, siblings and our community. In this way a child can learn all the behavioral characteristics necessary to be a functional family member, and in community.

However, since we are downloading the program’s by observing other people, what happens if we download programs from our parents, family, and siblings that are not constructive, that are actually very negative programs that have an adverse effect on our health or life in general?

It turns out science has revealed that during the first seven years of life, our brain is designed to download programs by simply observing other people. It’s a state of hypnosis, which is a characteristic of brain frequency called [Theta](https://mindprolab.com/the-easiest-way-to-change-your-beliefs/) which is just below Consciousness. The first 7 years of a child’s life is installing the programs, so when Consciousness kicks in at around age 7 it will use theses programs to create the behavior in their relationships, family, community etc…

We now know that about 70% of those programs that we download from other’s are negative, dis-empowering, and even self-sabotaging. Just to be clear, these programs are in the subconscious mind. We also have the ***conscious mind***, which kicks in at the age of 7. That mind is connected to your personal identity, and spirituality, the difference between the two is profound. The conscious mind is the creative mind. The ***subconscious mind*** is a programmed mind, a habit mind.

#### Why is it relevant?

Well, if you’re operating from the ***conscious mind***, then you’re creating your life from wishes, desires and aspirations. However, if your life is under the control of the ***subconscious mind***, it’s just going to play back the programs that you downloaded from other people. Since other people didn’t plan for your wishes and desires the download you’ve got may not allow you to obtain the life you truly desire. So the real question is.

#### Are we running our lives with the conscious mind? or are we running our lives with the subconscious programs?

Neuroscientist have shown that the conscious mind provides 5% of our conscious activity during the day, using the conscious minds creative wishes and desires. Most of our decisions, actions, emotions and behavior depend on the 95% of the brain activity that is beyond our conscious awareness, which means that 95% of our life comes from the programming in our subconscious mind.

So for 95% of the day were operating from these programs and the vast majority of them are dis-empowering, and Self-sabotaging downloads. We’re not leading a life that takes us towards wishes and desires, were leading a life that manifest the issues that we downloaded from other people, mostly negative. Therefore we struggle through life because you’re not operating from wishes and desires any longer, your operating from the habits you got from other people.

So, this becomes a very profound point because it says that the life that we’re leading, has already been controlled by the download of programs. This is not a new idea. For 400 years the Jesuits have told their followers, give me a child until age 7 and I will show you the man. What they were actually telling people, is if you give me an opportunity to download programs in the first seven years, that will determine the rest of the child’s life.

Now for the most important part. Where you struggle at in life, where you desire a certain outcome, you work hard, put in a lot of effort, sweat and tears to make it happen. But why are you struggling so hard to create those wishes and desires? the answer is simple. The programs that you were downloaded with do not support those ends. So as a result, your behavior is self-sabotaging.

#### When you are playing subconscious programs, Why are you playing them?

Because the function of your ***subconscious mind*** is to store and retrieve data. Its job is to ensure that you respond exactly the way you are programmed. Your subconscious mind makes everything you say and do fit a pattern consistent with your self-concept. The reason this becomes important is that it’s necessary for you to understand these programs, because we can change Those programs.

When we change the programs in the subconscious, we rewrite the character of Our Lives. While the conscious mind is the creative mind, it can learn in any number of ways, reading a self-help book, reading this particular article, or going to a lecture. You can easily download new knowledge into the conscious mind. The significance is the conscious mind is creative and smart. But the issue is that downloading new knowledge into the conscious mind does not change the program in the subconscious.

It’s a different mind and learns in a completely different way. The subconscious mind is the Habit mind and by definition we don’t change habits very easily. So for example, When did you learn to walk? before you were two. It doesn’t matter what age you were at. The majority of us never have to relearn how to walk, and I say well, thank you subconscious mind, because you’ve downloaded the habit of walking and it tries to resist any change to that.

But the same goes for a negative belief, it still tries to resist change. So the issue is this. How can I put programs into the subconscious mind? New ones to replace the ones that are sabotaging me.

#### How to Unlearn Limiting Mindsets and Become the Best Version of Yourself

There are only three ways you can rewrite the subconscious mind.

1. The first way is through energy psychology. Energy psychology is a relatively new method of therapy that combines Eastern approaches to the mind and body with Western psychology and psychotherapy ideas. Practitioners of energy psychotherapy claim that tapping acupuncture points while thinking about an anxiety-producing event can cure anxiety and phobias.
2. How do you get new programs after age seven? repetition. Practice, anything you needed to learn, you had to repeat it, and repeat it, to create a habit. So if you want to change a habit that’s not supporting you, you have to engage a habit that does support you. If you’re not a happy person, you can say every day no matter how unhappy you are, you say to yourself repetitively. I am happy, I am happy. Every day through out the day, you keep saying that. Repetition, habituation will change the program and one day you’ll wake up with your subconscious mind running a, I am happy program.
3. Lastly, the most effective way to change subconscious programming is through hypnosis. This is the process that you downloaded programs in the first 7 years of life. This is the mechanism that bypasses the ***conscious mind*** and therefore download new behaviors directly into the ***subconscious mind***. For more information on hypnosis And how it works, you can read over [Theta Waves Manifestation](https://mindprolab.com/downloads/theta-waves-manifestation/) to find if it’s what may work best for you, because using this process can rewrite your beliefs and radically change the character of your life.",30Apr2020,1
129,"While we are learning more about COVID-19, there is still so much we don’t know and may not know for some time. And that’s the cause of our deepest fear — **the fear of unknown**.

I’ll admit that I’m afraid of what’s happening. There are times at night when I start feeling shortness of breath just by reading too much into it. I imagine the worst and start experiencing the symptoms. This made me realize that there is another dimension to this pandemic that is not being discussed enough. This dimension could be called **Timidity Contagion** and it's impacting our mental health.

133,"i’m 15 and i’ve seen myself have serious signs of depression such as unexplainable sadness, loss of passion, suicidal thoughts etc. I slept at 6 am today and woke up to my 8 am alarm to eat breakfast and fall back to sleep. next thing i know is i get waken up to get scolded because of the grumpy expression i always have (which i do unintentionally), then get asked to do house chores. while working i start to sob and i get shouted at and asked why i’m crying. it was hard to put it out there, because i felt like i wasn’t approached the way i expected it to be. they even start questioning in a jokingly manner if i’m gonna come out as pregnant (lol not funny), and i finally told them, “I’m unhappy. I don’t know why, and I need help.” The response I get is... I don’t know. UNEXPLAINABLE. They tell me that it was my fault I’m like this, and if I chose to be happy and mingle with my family during quarantine I wouldn’t be crying like an ugly pig. I remember vividly, “It’s all in your head. Stop wasting my time. You chose to be like that and that’s on you.” Part of me tells me that they’re somehow right because why couldn’t I just choose to be happy just like them? I still couldn’t find the answer for that. I love my family, I really do, but sometimes situations like these test both them and I, whether they really love me and take care of me (not just with school, dance etc, but mental-health wise) or whether it really is my fault that I always prove them right that I’m a selfish piece of shit. 

I’m not saying that I wished that I had a new set of parents/family, it’s just that my expectations were never met. They always tell me that telling my problems to my friends won’t help bc they don’t know you at all, maybe that’s partly wrong.

138,"lemme just say, ive always had a hard time in school. ppl never seemed to like me and i never knew y. i assumed it was bc they thought i was weird or annoying. but that image stuck w/ me till hs, that’s just how it was in the town i grew up in. i had a small class and they were veryyy cliquey. and the ppl that were liked or were “popular” were either rlly rich, rlly smart, or forced their way up to popularity by forcing friendships w/ the rich and smart. 

but ppl like me were just always looked down upon. i was always targeted by ppl, no matter how nice or friendly i was. it felt like no one cared to b nice to me bc there would b no benefit out of it. growing up i wasnt the prettiest or skinniest, i was average smart but nothing outstanding, and i had an average income house. 

even as i grew up and moved on into hs, i feel like no one rlly gave me a chance. they just remembered the younger me. it didnt matter if i got prettier or more mature, it felt like ppl never rlly liked me. i was always nice to everyone and did the right thing, i tried to b perfect. im the kind of person who’s always in a good mood and smiling, but still no one seemed to rlly care for me.

but im sick of wondering what im doing wrong and if it’s my fault bc im “weird” or “annoying” or whatever ppl could possibly say about me. ive been nothing but nice to everyone and they still treat me like shit. and ik above all that im a good person and i love who i am. anyone would b lucky to b friends w someone like me. and im done comparing myself to girls who have never been thru what ive been thru.

139,"I find this very strange and it has happened to me for a few years now so if anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it.

When I get nervous and try to eat something I genuinely can't - I feel sick and my body doesn't want to swallow or eat anything in general, all I can do is drink lots. As a result, if I get nervous in a social setting where food is involved, I am unable to eat anything.

This has led to embarrassment on a number of occasions and has therefore led to me feeling more and more nervous for eating in public. 

Examples include first meals with my new flat at university, first meals with my girlfriend, first meals with my girlfriend's family. All of these occasions, the nerves hit me and I couldn't do anything.

When it happens once with a group of people, naturally I feel more nervous for the next time incase it happens again, and then it often does.

I don't know what to do about it - don't think there's anything I can do about the actual effects nerves have on me - that sounds physiological - but maybe I can calm myself down and not be nervous for these events but I don't know what to do.

I am extremely stubborn and get angry or irritated over small things. When arguing with someone I can’t bring myself to apologize first. I find myself lying all the time mostly about little things but sometimes big things. I’ll tell a story that didn’t actually happen or intensify my own stories. I love my boyfriend dearly but I find myself lying to him for no reason. I’ll tell little stories that didn’t happen but the biggest lie I’ve told was that my father molested me.

147,"Hey guys! New poster here, I'm trying to do something positive during quarantine so here it goes! 

I've struggled with severe panic attacks and agoraphobia for years. One day talking to my therapist he recommend a simple technique of, snapping a rubber band on my wrist.

The thought is, it distracts and grounds the mind and over time actually helps to correct the negative thoughts or behaviors.

It can be used for depression, anxiety, OCD, stress, etc. 

When I would feel a anxiety or panic attack come on I would just start snapping the band and focus on the sensation, it was a form of grounding and allowed me something to focus on and was a great tool in managing my anxiety. 

So one day I got to thinking of creating a bracelet that would be more durable then a rubber band because they constantly break and also look better as I'd get questions about why I was wearing a rubber band. 

So for the last few months I've been working it and am finally at a point where I wanna share it.

I named it the Snap-Out bracelet. As its intended to snap you out of whatever your feeling, anxiety, depression, compulsive thoughts etc. 

I made these out of a mixed rubber compound so they can be elastic yet durable. They Come in a bunch of colors as well!

I really wanted to create something that was helpful and did some good so I also am donating $1 per every bracelet sold to NAMI ( National Alliance on Mental Illness) 

This May never take off like I hope, but if I could help a few people even in a small way I think it be worth it.

I get the symptoms in the title, which according to Google are anxiety symptoms, often when I think about school or the fact that I've deconverted and (almost) nobody knows. They continue for a bit with any combination of those symptoms. Are these anxiety attacks?

Also, a while ago I had two attacks (?) of a different nature, triggered by the deconversion thing. These attacks had no obvious physical symptoms unlike the above. They both occurred in social environments. Their main feature was a constant sense of alarm or alertness, an inability to change my thoughts to focus on anything else, and an overwhelming feeling that I wasn't safe there and that I would be ""found out"" and the consequences thereof. They seemed to ""snowball"" from an initial thought, such as ""I have a secret"" (the trigger of the second instance.)

154,"I think something's been really off.

I remember waking up on some day, and going like ""today's going to be a good day"". And I lived in the moment. And nothing particularly special happened that day, except I was really fucking happy. And I remember a few friends told me I looked really pretty but they couldn't place why, even had some guy I'd only spoken to once that day text me letter and day that. Woah.

That was in August. From the day after that, I haven't felt that even once. And I've been feeling like shit.

I don't really know what went wrong? There was no specific event or anything? I've been eating a lot less, to lose weight, even though I was only 108 pounds, and my friends started trying to basically force me to eat lunch, and my mom said I've been getting thinner and thinner. Someone was half-jokingly like, ""do you like, have anorexia or something?"". And I was like, huh, maybe I do, maybe that's why I've been feeling like shit, so I googled the symptoms but that doesn't really feel right...?? Like it's not like food makes me sick or anything, and it's harder for me to resist eating than it is to eat. I'm just dieting, I don't think it's because of an obsessive need to lose weight or anything. But I don't know.

Then, I think from October to December? I started feeling kind of ""floaty""? Like things just felt off. And I remember Dodie talking about depersonalization disorder so I googled that. But it felt like more like i was reading the symptoms and not really understanding whether I had them or not. Like, for example, not feeling like you're a part of your body. I don't know to what extent you're supposed to feel that. I suppose in some situations I kind of feel like it's not really me, and when I think back to old memories some of them are in third person, but I guess people with the disorder actually physically feel like they're not in their body...??

But like, I was like huh, if I don't have depersonalization disorder, I've got to have something, right?¿ Or is this how everyone else feels?? I don't think how I was feeling was normal at all??? And I remember my friends kept asking me if I was okay or did something happen, for those entire two months, and my french teacher even told me several times in one class that if anything had happened I could come talk to her. And I was like ""nah, I'm fine"", because I wasn't really sure if I was fine..????

And then after that, I've just been feeling kind of,,, empty?? And I pull all-nighters every two days or so??? And I eat all day?? But sometimes I skip dinner?? And I feel really fucking tired all day, like grabbing my phone or climbing up stairs, or watching a movie feels soooo tiring, but I'm not sure if that's just my blood pressure problems or because I'm sleepy or a result of me not eating properly, or a symptom of something.

And, I don't know am I just being an edgy teen or there's something wrong with me??? And now it's really hard to explain why and how I feel off. And I mean, don't get me wrong, even though I said I feel ""empty"", that's not really true, I do still cry, I feel happy when my friends call me, I feel irritated when I read books. I'm not emotion-less, but I'm lacking something??

And I mean, I've been kind of giving up on my hobbies, but I don't know if that's just because I'm tired or because I have depression or something. And sometimes, the problem gets a lot worse, but sometimes I feel okay. And sometimes I can't really tell which. Like right now. The whole day I've just been sort of going through the motions, and I'm crying while writing this. But not in a sad sort of way, it's a clinical sort of crying.

Also, I'm just mentioning this in case it's related (but I don't think it is??) I have a sort of hard time feeling empathy?¿ Like a friend reached out saying she attempted suicide, and although I tried listening to her and offering help, I just didn't feel...sad?? Like huh. Okay. That's a problem I have to fix. Same with when my first cousin died, or my classmate's bestfriend died. I just don't feel bad. It feels like something happening on the newspaper. I thought me not reacting to my cousin dying was something to do with how everyone feels grief in different ways, but it's been the same way for three years now. In fact, as horrible as it is to say, whenever my parents brought it up I'd get kind of irritated, like ""ughh I gotta pretended to be sorry now and you ruined a perfectly interesting conversation"".

Oh also I haven't had a crush in two years??? Is that normal??? Is that a symptom of anything????

I'm sorry if this post is a mess :( I just want someone to tell me what's wrong with me (or if there isn't anything at all and everyone feels this way and does these things).",30Apr2020,1
155,"Around a year ago I was clinically diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I have suffered with this for years since I was a kid but have always had this nagging feeling that there’s something else. 

I have previously mentioned this to the Dr who diagnosed me, this but it didn’t raise any so called red flags with him. My mood can be stable, happy, positive and then out of the blue change. This is usually from someone saying something that upsets me which almost triggers (what feels like at the time) deep sadness and this urge to self destruct / self harm. This isn’t usually triggered from big trauma in my life, it’s from small things which is why I’m confused. One small thing can completely wreck my mood and take me into a dark place. Switch to an hour and a half later and I can be back in that good mood like I had before. I also have found that during these ‘episodes’ that I say things / do things for attention or a reaction. This isn’t in my nature at all. Any help / advice would be appreciated.",30Apr2020,1

I’ve never felt like I could do ‘anything’, my brother is bipolar and is constantly thinking of new ideas and inventions and talks about how intelligent he is and feels like he can do anything, I’ve never felt like that. 
I also go through periods where I look for a ‘high’ and do things that are relatively reckless, just something exciting. And I go through multiple highs (inspired and like I CAN be someone and take care of myself) and lows (terrified, depressed) throughout the month, maybe three of them?  
I do also have some compulsive tendencies where I wash my face all the time and during my ‘high’ I clean for hours, during my low I can barely clean at all.

One example is that I always feel like eyes are on me. Even when I'm home. Like I'm being watched and judged. I act talk and walk different because of these thoughts.
I have a very active and elaborate imagination. See things around corners and movement out of the corner of my eyes constantly. I imagine things coming around corners running full speed at me screaming. I imagine these things in such full detail in my head that I stop in my place. This happens when I'm just walking about or in my home. Or similar scenarios when I'm driving.Also I sleep walk  Frequently. I run around my house and see walking nightmares like I'm Hallucinating I see my dreams clear but then I'll snap out of it wake up and I'm just standing in my home .
Last I talk to myself frequently. I am my best friend.
I talk aloud and say things like, U and we. I have Full conversations aloud likes it's a other person with me. While watching movies, driving, playing video games, cooking anything. 
I feel like different people some days. Angry, strong, confident ready for anything. Or another hour or day later scared,  Insecure, acting kid like.

173,Actions do not accumulate effort through change. Change is only truly determined through the spontaneity and emotional reaction to communicate. Physical action has time to bide and counter or agree with the opposition's or affiliates defense. Change or maintenance of opinion physically is abundant with the advantages of time and adverse thought.

175,"Hi everyone, I hope you all are okay, I’m a 19 year old girl &amp; this post is going to be a long one I just have a lot on my chest. My therapist is on maternity leave hence why I’m here. I am diagnosed with major depressive disorder recurrent, major anxiety disorder recurrent, and eating disorder not specified for reference. Right before I turned 18 I tried multiple antidepressants and antianxiety medications (none of them worked for me) and I’ve been off them for more than a year now, when I turned 18 a switch went off inside of me it sounds silly but everything used to be so beautiful to me everything was so deep and meaningful; morning dew on the grass, the way the sunsets, driving, rainfall, conversations, emotions, everything held this grand meaning to me, until the day I turned 18, ever since then I’ve been living through this fog, I don’t feel much, I don’t feel these intense connections, I am just here, going though the motions. Through 14-17 i was partying a lot, had a really bad eating disorder which I recovered from but recently relapsed. I dropped out of highschool my senior year which is a shame I’ve always been Anamara kid in school but my mental state destroyed me, and I’m getting my GED as soon as this Covid19 thing is over. I have an opportunity to move 7 hours away driving from my hometown and start a new life in my own apartment and go to college there. I’m really close to my family, really close, (codependent much). I work and have two close friends I see a couple of times a month. I’ve never had a lot of luck with friends or any type of relationship and that’s because I’m not secure in myself i feel like. My day to day includes waking up, talking to my parents for a while, going to work, going home &amp; talking with my parents, scrolling through social media and going to sleep. It’s funny because I always wanted to be this “free” person but I’m so self disciplined and love control that I don’t allow myself to be. My parents were always so cool with me and trusted me but I made these structures and boundaries for myself this need for perfection. In middle school &amp; highschool I was well liked I always put people first and was always there for everyone. I still am, I’m just overall an empathetic person to the point that I forget about me. I’m writing this sitting on the couch listening to a bin over song it’s gloomy out, I haven’t even gotten to the point I’m just rambling. My mom she’s my bestfriend she was diagnosed with COPD and emphysema when I was 16 (I was in Costa Rica at the time on vacation with my ex bestfriend) when I came back she had an oxygen tank and no one had told me, she’s hospitalized atleast 5 times a year because she continues to smoke even when she’s on oxygen. My uncle who i was close with died 2 months ago from a heart attack, he was as alone at his farm, no one had heard from him all day, my aunt drove to the farm and found him, he also had COPD he never really took care of it either (still smoked and drank a bottle of jim bean everyday, it was a shock to the whole family, his family came from North Carolina, I saw his dead body at the viewing and I held his hand and cried a lot. The week before he died my mom and my aunt really wanted to go to church (which was weird they never go) and I said outloud someone in our family is going to die and I thought it would be my grandpa or grandma but never him (this isn’t the first time I’ve had this intense 6th sense, it happens when something that is going to change my life or someone else’s life is about to occur) Ever since he died something changed, all I think about is how my mom could be next, i love her so much. I am grieving when she’s still alive. My mom tried to kill herself when I was 14 and was baker acted and attempted again on my 17th birthday. I’ve almost lost her twice and now I have to go through it again and I don’t know when and it’s killing me, I don’t know what to do with myself it’s all I think about, I picked up my eating disorder again as a security blanket and no one knows and I just want to scream and cry and I want to die before my mom does I can’t bare to see this. It’s so sad seeing someone deteriorate right before your eyes and they don’t want to help themselves it’s selfish but I love her I love my family they are all I have I don’t want to live in a world without my family I don’t have anything or anyone i feel like I’m just a kid. Whenever I touch or look or talk to my mom I do it as if it’s my last time. I’m lucky to have a beautiful relationship with my mom, dad, sister, cousins, aunts and uncles, I know some people have it worse. I just don’t feel good I want to disappear. Where did the time go?

176,"Long story short, I went through a little breakdown two years ago that involved crying and panicking for maybe a month. After that incident I've never been quite the same and I tend to run away from obstacles instead of facing them ( but it has gotten better now because now I try to push myself to face new challenges :D  ) But whenever I look back and think of those days, I panic a little and I try to suppress my emotions as much as I can. I don't tell many people the full depth of the situation because I don't feel comfortable sharing so much about myself.

Right now, I am preparing to enter a new phase in my life and I so badly want to succeed in it and be happy! However that little fiasco kind of hinders me from trying new things, and more importantly, from allowing me to be happy :/ . The memory just lingers and I cant shake it off! :(

Thus, I'm trying to see if there's anyone willing to give me some advice on how to overcome something that took a mental toll on their lives, and maybe even how to grow from it. :)

Over the past week, I’ve noticed a sharp mental decline in myself. Prior to last week, I was generally very acute and quick on my feet, so to speak. However, this past week has been unprecedented in terms of my lack of energy and ability to think, and I’m afraid it may be hinting a larger, hidden issue—perhaps an underlying mental health issue like anxiety or otherwise. It’s quite hard to put into words what I’m experiencing, but it’s almost as if my brain stalls whenever I try to reason through something—the more intimidating/complicated the mental endeavor, the more I feel hopeless, and my mind reacts accordingly. Throughout the entirety of whatever thought process I’m moving through, my brain feels like it is undergoing an overwhelming numbness. I wasn’t like this just a week prior. It just baffles me how I’ve seemingly done a full 180 with respect to cognitive function. Speaking, writing, and the production of language is just so exhausting right now. I feel as though I have to exert tons of energy for the simplest of tasks. Verbally stringing together a multi-faceted, coherent thought seems like an impossible task right now. I’ll say a sentence and will immediately be unmotivated to continue. I haven’t endured any physical head injuries recently or anything like that. Whenever I lie down, I feel slightly lightheaded, too. Is it possible that this problem goes beyond mental health? I have no idea what the cause of this could be. I have an (undiagnosed) history of anxiety and OCD. Maybe it’s sleep deprivation. I honestly have no idea. Thoughts?",30Apr2020,1

180,"When I was +\- 19, what I thought to be a personality trait turned into anxiety/depression. It heavily affected or should I say crippled my relations with people. At the time I couldn’t figure out what was going on. Now being an anxious and neurotic person, most social activities became chains of embarrassing mishaps. Anxiety and neuroticism is something that was always there to an extent so it’s impossible to tell when it became an issue. Going through life as a kid I took my freeze response with me everywhere I went, turning casual lunch or coffee with friends into a dreadful experience.

Eventually, once I accumulated enough embarrassing memories with people in my life. My self image changed. I drew my self image from being very smart in school and very fit physically, even funny in social settings. Somewhere along the way to becoming a responsible adult I lost that way of perceiving myself and started basing my selfworth on all my fails and shortcomings. 

Whatever the journey was - different for everyone - the destination remains the same. 

Thinking that maybe it wasn’t the place for me, at 20 years of age I decided to leave everything I knew behind and leave. Failing to realise that I’m trying to leave behind something thats a part of me. I made the move. Guess what - the only thing that I managed to leave behind are childhood friends and all the people i knew before I became what i am now - maybe it would happen anyway if i stayed.

I am now a 23 year old man. Hard to talk to - the other day I got compared to Ozzy Osbourne. A regular occurence. See I’m having some serious cognitive issues lately that have been getting a lot worse over the years. Its probably a part of why I am being perceived by people the way I am. You can invite me out and I could honestly not say a word for the entirety of the outing. Causing people to pick on me, cause honestly why is that quiet guy even here?

Don’t know what the point in this post is. It is one of numerous posts that never got posted. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is that the reason that people perceive me this way. Is because thats what I am. Not because I’m misunderstood, not because they’re judging or some shit like that. It’s not them. It’s me.

I have a faulty OS. A good old machine that will never run properly cause of a glitch in the system. A faulty perception of the world. Im just incompatible with this place.

We live in a quiet suburban community with very little to no crime.


She has three locks on each door all with different keys


Two locks on each window that must remain locked at all times because she says someone could reach in (through a one inch slit) and unlock the window 


Has a ladder by the front door blocking it between the door and the wall 'in case someone tries to come in'


Thinks her DVD player was stolen by the plumber by opening the side window and throwing it to his buddy (later found under her bed)


Sleeps with two knives under her pillow and a bat behind the door. Debated on getting a gun and gun lessons but that fell through because she's scared of guns. Wanted to get a dog but didn't want to take care of it


Thinks the government is watching her on her computer so downloaded two anti virus systems


Convinced when going on a walk a dog is going to attack her and talks about how she has a pocket knife with her in case it happens 


Thinks her boss is out to fire her at any chance she gets (been at this company 20 years)


Thinks the cashier at our gym is stalking us because she saw him on one of our walks


If the blinds to the house are not shut by sunset I get a long speech how she would see a car on the street looking into the house and taking notes on what's inside 


Thinks at times when people bring in food to her work it has laxatives in it 


Convinced any repair man who comes in is taking photos and sending it to their friends so they know when to come back and break in


Every person who walks by our house she watches through the window and becomes uneasy when they slow down. Same goes for cars even though we have a stop sign at our corner


On top of that she never says anything particularly positive. Everything she says has negitive under tones. I had asked her on that to and she told me it's just something that happens when you age and that I'm going to end up being as negative as her. She says when I own a home I'm going to be as paranoid as her and that I'll understand when I'm older.

I love life now. I’m happy now, and excited, and okay.

I planned to write this weeks ago, while on the high of “post” - that foreign, confusing feeling of hope. I planned that I’ll tell this community that I got through “it”; that I was going to answer questions from “the other side.”

Unfortunately, because as I think you’ll all agree, the mind is the absolute most powerful thing, I am here burying my head into a bowl of cereal, phone on my left hand while my right is holding my vegetable of a grandmother - writing to you at 2am post-breakdown, and definitely not post-depression.

But guys, the foreign feeling is still here. It’s not as vibrant, and exciting as depicted in film and taught at school. Or maybe, this is the only type of hope us crazies get to have. But it’s still here.

I’m not telling you it’s gonna be okay, because truth be told, I don’t know that for sure. World is fucking plain cruel for the hell of it. I don’t know what I’m telling you.

Maybe, I’m hoping that you’ll read this, and wait one more night. Choose to cry and hold on, instead of being numb and letting go- for one more night.

Then, I’ll keep hoping for the both of us. Until I can get to share that hope with you.

I really don’t know if any of what I wrote made sense. If not, and if someone is still reading, then I just want to say thanks. I was “unhelpable” and unresponsive when I first started to post here, and yet you guys didn’t stop until I got to a point where I can say

192,"Hello all! Ever since I was a child, I’ve experienced anxiety, severe panic attacks, extreme bouts of anger, and passive/active suicidal thoughts from certain noises. I don’t know why this happens to me, but it’s beginning to negatively impact my life and my mental health. Some of the noises that will set me off are: fireworks, balloons popping, light stomping from people one floor above me, humming, singing, loud music, and most percussion instruments. I’m extremely sensitive to those things and experience sensory overload pretty quickly when hearing them. Some info about me: I’m diagnosed with unspecified bipolar disorder, and my parents believe me to be on the autism spectrum (although it’s never been confirmed).. I read that hypersensitivity to noises can be a symptom of both bipolar and autism, so idk. I’m going to seek out a psychiatrist soon, but I just want opinions of what this could possibly be!

199,"Hey everyone, thanks for this subreddit. I'm trying to take this time in quarantine to work on myself and I'm not a big fan of therapists/counselors or medication so this forum is perfect for me.

Down to business: How can I forgive myself for things I've done over a decade ago? I've been feeling a lot of guilt and shame over this stuff. I was your typical rude, self-serving high school student. Later on I also acted selfishly toward romantic partners (breaking up suddenly, infidelity, etc.)

Here's where I am currently with coping: I have had to acknowledge what I did. I thought a lot about ""how would I have felt if these things happened to me rather than being the person who made these things happen?"" and I've worked to reflect on that. I have not reached out to people I've hurt--I've lost contact with many of those people and I keep in mind that bringing up potentially-bad-and-forgotten memories may be like ripping off a band aid, doing more harm than good. And finally I have said to myself, ""What you did back then was wrong. You didn't have the empathy skills to consider others, you didn't have the communication skills to express yourself, you didn't trust yourself to be vulnerable with your exes, and you didn't have the confidence to build yourself up without tearing others down. Now you do have those skills and you can use them. You are better than you were. When we know better we do better.""

200,"To start this off, i don't think i have bipolar or anything of the sorts. Sometimes i just feel like i can't control my own thoughts. It's like everything i think about flows on it's own accord. When i'm imagining some things it almost never goes the way i want it, it's like there's this...well, not thing, but like a force which is really hard to overcome. This force basically takes whatever thoughts i have and just lets them play out even when i want them to stop. Sometimes i'll want to think about some things slowly, but i'll end up just speeding through those thoughts, often getting lost in them and having to backtrack. Sometimes my thoughts will interrupt eachother, and i'll start think about one thing and switch to another. 

Also, whenever i listen to a song that really brings intense emotions to me, i'll have that song stuck in my head all the time. I'll try to stop the song but it'll just start right up again. I'd even make the sound the needle of the record player makes when the song is stopped to somehow increase the effect but still nothing. It's really weird.

Too avoid to much detail, a lot of what typically occurs are arguments based on what annoys me. for instance, one argument could be why I’m always initiating the conversation and she isn’t. A second argument would be Snapchat “streaks.” Like if a girl has streaks with multiple men, too me it’s telling that she holds more than one interest. Essentially, it’s dumb shit that we fight over. And frequently too. 
Although it’s not much detail, is frequent arguing revealing of ones personality? Or is it something deeper than that like a personality disorder or other condition? I could be arguing with them and I’ll be fine after it’s over - as if nothing happens. What is that indicative of?",30Apr2020,1

207,"I am a person who has been dealing with OCD since I was around 7 that progressively got worse (I am now 18.)
My OCD largely affects my hand-washing more than anything. So far all these years, hand washing for me was a process of washing your hand till your brain gave you the signal that you’re good to go (about 3-5 times). If I stopped washing before the signal, I would just feel seriously anxious, which is basically what OCD is.
But for the last 10 days or so my brain doesn’t give that signal anymore, and even after washing 6-8 times it doesn’t feel any different. Now it is just my brain short-circuiting serious anxiousness that really doesn’t let me function. For the last 2 days I’ve had serious headaches and I believe anxiety is the reason.
I’m well familiar with meditation and “mindfulness”, and those two were usually the things that I’d turn to when I was going through something. But I seriously can’t calm my brain down, I’m constantly anxious and I don’t even think it’s about the hands anymore. Just no matter what I do, sit in the dark, try to meditate, try to sleep, my mind feels like it’s frying itself. 
The fact that these are serious times and pandemic and whatnot has been causing the distress would be a good answer, but honestly I was thrilled about lockdown, I have a list of books that I was hyped to go through, but I can’t even focus on that anymore.

209,"I've posted a lot before, but suffice to say - my experiences of therapy were a nightmare.  They were a nightmare essentially of the diagnosis and treatment plans I got grossly misunderstanding what was actually going on for me and in my life, and then deciding that my perception was the problem and repeatedly attempting to fix what I was seeing to match with the errors of the treatment team. 

I've heard an awful lot of verbal hand-wringing about how those things shouldn't happen.  But there is no evidence that the professionals I saw had ill intent, were in any way unethical, or were significantly below average ability.  All the attempts I've heard in practice were based on significant assumptions about what actually happened that aren't true.

By and large I've found professionals don't want to talk to people like me.  They sort of edge uncomfortably around the questions.  Or they insist on finding ways that I must be lying or my mental illness must be making me say these things happened.  There's so often a strong defensive note, like they don't want to even acknowledge that a properly trained and well intentioned professional could genuinely harm a client.

I don't think cases like mine are just issues of individual therapists not being qualified.  There are deeper issues.  I was dealing with major childhood abuse issues that simply don't match the kinds of things that therapists are trained to look for.  (I suspect there's a pretty heavy gender bias here, and one that goes beyond simple individual biases.)  The statements I made - true statements, at least by the standards of normal english - matched the patterns laid out for distorted thinking.  I don't think it's in cases like mine that simply certain therapists are bad, but that what people like me actually need is at odds with what modern psychology says.  And there's an edge to psychology that they know what we need even if we disagree.

I know these problems can happen in physical medicine too, but physical medicine doesn't have the same base idea that the client's perspective is distorted or incorrect that mental health care does.  It also doesn't have quite the same idea in most cases of how much effort the client needs to be putting in, and especially not in what are commonly such vague and unverifiable ways.  And those are the aspects that allowed things to go so badly, and that turned it from being just a misdiagnosis into a huge traumatic experience.

Where do we go for answers?  Not just support or vague comments about how these things shouldn't have happened, but real answers as to how the mental health system actually is trying to make sure we're safe and to improve standards of care, rather than just blaming us for not getting better.",30Apr2020,1

211,"So this sort of thing happens alot. I don't live with my parents anymore, which I think is a good thing, but my dad and I have always butted heads, and I'm sort of wondering whether or not it's his fault, mine, or both.

Most recent example.

He doesn't like marijuana. I know that but I'm an adult and while I never bring it into his home, or talk about it that much, we were having what I felt was a rather reasonable adult conversation about why people like it, and why I like it.

I said I liked it, because it made conversations with my friends more interesting, and you can make connections that you wouldn't normally have made as quickly. It's also relaxing.

His response was that 'it doesn't make people smarter,' to which I replied that that wasn't what I was trying to say.

After that, he got angry with me, saying I always do this, that he wasn't saying that I said that, that I should be so defensive and pick a fight all the time.

I was just trying to clarify my point, but everytime he does something like this, which he's done all my life, it makes me feel like I did something wrong. 

My dad had a bad childhood, and I know he does the best he can with how he was raised. He had a narcissist mother and his father died young. I try to be sympathetic, but sometimes he makes me feel like I'm starting all these confrontations, and its never my intention. I'm getting rather sick of it, but I feel like I'm overreacting too.

I'd like to know if anyone ever felt like this and if so if there's a name to it, I'm not looking for a diagnosis since I'll reach out to someone as soon as we'll be allowed outside. 

Due to some traumatic events I developed a tic: I touch my eyebrows whenever I'm mildly stressed ( most of my life). I'm exceptionally emotionally volatile, and can sense deeply what others mean when they talk to me, I'm very aware of their facial expressions. 

The last three years of my life are like a cloud to me, I know I lived them but was in such a state that can't remember. It was as if I never had rest. 

I'm a very introverted person, not shy, but in uni I made some friends whom I love, and spent most of my time with them being an extrovert. I was very loud and obnoxious, but also funny. My self esteem started crumbling into pieces and from being extremely passionate about my work I became stressed about results. Every confronfrontation/emotion/situation became life or death. I felt in a fight or flight mode everyday, never feeling at home or secure about myself, my accomodation or people around me. 

I developed irrational fears that currently haunt me, like my parents dying when I'm not there with them, or being homeless or just not being able to live life normally. 

I see how being more open also made me more susceptible about being criticized by others, plus a good amount of rude people may have helped. But still all that nervousness and being attentive all the time made me paranoid about anything I did, I had to make everything right and in time, which stressed me out even more because I'm not naturally so. My mind always had some kind of racing thought going on like a broken disk, I became an overcomplainer always ruminating about something and actually telling others about it! Which was something I had never done, and it was the only thing that could bring me some temporary relief. 

I had become a functioning human being on the outside, overworking myself getting little results,  but my mind was crumbling. My mood swings are only due to reactions to others, this quarantine helped me realizing that. But at the same time I can't live isolated just because I fear I might start crying just because someone else is angry. I developed in the physical world but regressed emotionally. Instead of sadness I feel despair, instead of contentment I feel extreme happiness, instead of annoyance I feel rage (can't express it fortunately!).

I know this might sound ridiculous to many of you, but I'm an 18M that's constantly looking at my very tiny baby hands.

Statistically (yes I've checked because I'm that insecure about it), the average for my height is supposed to be 7.8 inches. Not only that, I'm also in the 5th percentile, meaning that men of all heights have bigger hands than me, and more than half of women have bigger hands than me also. 

It really feels like I'm cursed with it. Sometimes it makes me resent my parents because it feels like they given me a genetic defect.

My friend (15, m) hasn’t been great. He first revealed to me in January that he’s been hearing voices. He has characters in his head that he can’t control, but they have reportedly since gone silent. He’s always been a little paranoid, but it seems to have recently gotten much worse. February, he was convinced that he was in a social experiment and everyone around him was payed to be there. He says that ended in mid-March. Most recently he has been hearing animals where there aren’t any, he says they’re “clawing at the doors”.  He knows he needs help, and told me today he thinks he’s “losing his grip”. He wants help, but is afraid his mother will find out. Way back, before it got this bad, he requested to see a therapist, but she doesn’t think he needs one. His mother told him she would ashamed if he was hiding anything from her, so he doesn’t want to reveal anything now (I know his mother, I don’t think she would say anything like this, so it might just be paranoia). Back when we still had school (damn you covid) he was too scared to see the school councillor, worried his mother might find out. He tried the kids help line, but says they just gave him breathing exercises. He tried to tell his doctor, but his mother was in the room. I really don’t know how to help him, or how to get him help.

228,"Basically what the title says. I'm Danish (24, female), and I have a boyfriend in the Netherlands (25, male) (long story), and he's *really* having a hard time coping with this situation (not being able to see his therapist, not being able to work out etc etc). He cries on the phone when we talk, and it is horrible to sit here and not be able to do anything. Panic attacks are frequent as well. Every day is basically a struggle for him, and he cannot use his roommate or his parents as an outlet for various reasons.  

However, due to the rules that our governments have, and the travel restrictions of both countries, it would actually be possible for me to get there *and* get back again, however the guidelines state that visits must only be for ""necessary purposes"", and I have a really hard time gauging if this is one of those.  

My family is really againsts it, saying I'm risking the health of the people around me and myself, which is somewhat true, but it is not like we would be anywhere but his apartment.  

It's incredibly hard to know what is the right thing to do here, but it is also horrible to watch him suffer like this with no one to help him. What should I do?

231,"I am in 6th grade, 13 years old. And i have some problems at school. I dont know if this is bullying or if they are just joking around, or do i just overthink? Here is the problem.

Im a kid who is not amazing at sports, at least not as good as my classmates. There are mainly two guys, an example of what makes me sad is a thing that happened today. We played Table Tennis at the break, and when a ball was played to me someone blocked it when i was going to take it, and those two were laughing and said to get to the line. They were kinda ”mocking” me. But i didnt go to the line of course. And i won, and when i was going to pick up the ball they palmed it away. And the next time i went up, i was up against one of the two guys. And he went ”OH ITS [My name]” in a kind of mocking voice, and laughed after he won.

Outside of the breaks and sports and all that, i would say that they probably dont really care and i get somewhat along with them sometimes. So its not really class that is the problem, its P.E and the breaks. One of the guys isnt in class, he is only in the classes that we arent in the classroom.

I dont really know what to do. Am I overthinking?
There is only one month of school left until i switch. But do you have tips on making the situation better? Ask further questions in the comments.",30Apr2020,1
232,"So I’m not quite sure why this just came back into my mind but about 6 years ago I was going through an incredibly hard time mentally and begged my GP to refer me to a psychiatrist again. 

I had spent my teenage years in and out of psychiatric hospitals, clinics and counseling sessions. I was severely suicidal, depressed, bipolar and had had a bout of psychosis. After a 6 month stint in a psychiatric hospital my parents could no longer afford the incredibly high price for my care. I was told that they could no longer keep me there and that I was cured. During my sessions there I had spoken of abuse caused by my mother. This had fallen on deaf ears and after having spoke to my mother they decided I had completely made this up (even though there had been reports made of bruising, cuts etc on my body multiple times from previous sessions). This led them to make a false diagnosis as to why this had happened to me and provide me with the wrong treatment and coping mechanisms. When they brought me in to tell me I was cured I again begged them to listen to me and explain why I needed to be there. I begged them that I needed help with the abuse and if I went home I would be right back in the same situation. I may have spoken quite loudly when trying to get them to listen. I of course should not have done that but it was out of pure stress. I was immediately shot down again and was told by the most senior doctor that I was a spoilt child. I gave up and left. 

Anyway, so 6 years ago I begged my GP to refer me to a psychiatrist again as I had reached a new low and was terrified that one more tiny thing was gonna lead me to attempt suicide again. He referred me and I felt so relieved to speak to someone again. I went in for the appointment so excited to meet my new psychiatrist. I was met by a very abrupt and rude lady who had not read my file whatsoever and had no idea why I was there or anything about my past. Instead she very loudly told me that she will not be taking me on as a patient. I was confused, and before I could finish my question as to why that was she spoke over me to say ‘you are depressed because you are fat’. I was so shocked I couldn’t even speak, I just sat there my mouth bobbing like a goldfish as this woman tried to explain my life to me without ever learning anything about me. She told me that I could just lose weight and I would be happy. 

Now if this were to happen me currently then I would be able to stand up for myself, tell this woman off for her rude behavior and cause uproar with the entire system for being treated that way. However I was so low at the time and had no energy to defend myself that I simply got up and left. 

I never tried again to ask for help. I never spoke to anyone about what this psychiatrist had said to me out of pure embarrassment and I never took it further with the mental health system there. I’m so glad that I managed to stop myself from hurting myself and that I am now content and healthy without anyone’s help but my own, but being reminded of this really makes me angry. I hope that there are no other people asking for help that are treated this way, I dread to think there is another 20 year old being spoken to this way and shut down completely when they take the courage to admit they need help. It makes me sick how bad the mental health system is in my home country.",30Apr2020,1
233,"I have always thought that I’m not as worthy as other people. I have had eating problems since I was a child. I ate whenever I felt any emotions and I’m still doing it now. Mainly I eat sugary things till I get sick and then I keep eating and won’t stop until there’s nothing left. Whenever I feel sad I like to isolate myself for a long time and not to talk to anyone or act like everything is okay. When I’m angry I say the worst things to my mum and my sister because I want to hurt them, I want to hurt them emotionally and physically (the worst part is that I enjoy this) and I hate myself for that because I love them the most and I sometimes get the feeling like I have already lost them or that they are not real. It’s like I’m just seeing my life once again. Later I always feel guilty and want to hurt myself somehow because of how awful I was. When I was younger I had nosebleeds at least once a week, I loved seeing the blood dropping to the sink so I didn’t even try to stop the nosebleeds. This one time I let the blood drop in to the glass and then I showed it to my family and drank it in front of them. When I was 15 I had some problems with cutting myself, it wasn’t that bad because they weren’t that deep to cause any harm. I had an emotionally abusive relationship where I forgave him too many times when I shouldn’t have. I feel like I’m not worthy of anything and that people around me would be sometimes better without me, I don’t have suicidal thoughts anymore, but I think it would be better if I was alone somewhere far away. I have went through some childhood trauma but i think that I should be healed from that by now. I also get these weirs anxiety attacks at the most random times and I’m afraid of going to sleep.

Whenever I feel an intense or strong emotion, I automatically tend to suppress it, even if I was on the verge of crying, I stop it before I do. 
Suddenly I feel numb, like just strangely calm and can't get myself to move? All the tension and throughout my body eases, i feel tired then suddenly that strong emotion just goes away like that, in a matter of minutes and I feel totally numb to it

If I don’t do this, I get an overwhelming urge to self harm. I think it’s because when I was younger (I’m 20 currently) I used to get these weird tick-like tendencies and I’d self harm to distract me from the tick-like tendencies to consistently rotate my wrist as my wrist would become so sore.

Even when one thing starts getting better it is immediately replaced by some new problem, and even if I get start getting used to something, for some reason all these problems love to get worse over time, so I get the added anxiety about that too. I am tired of being uncomfortable every time I move. I wish for once I could get temporarily sick and get better, completely, with nothing lingering, just for once in my stupid life. I am only 25 and I don't think I want to live past 50, because I don't know how I will cope with the normal health problems that come with old age (if I even make it that far). 

I can understand having a few health problems, everyone does, but I already had a few before this and I don't know how to cope anymore. I stupidly spent my time before this focusing on school and work, and now, when I thought I might finally have the time and energy to do the things I want to do, instead I have to deal with this crap.

I am angry that things keep getting worse, it feels neverending and I feel like I'm never going to be comfortable just existing in my body. 

How do you cope with this? I was in therapy for almost a year but things have gotten worse since then.

244,"TLDR at the bottom. 


Growing up, my mood was unpredictable. It was a constant state of anger, immaturity, anxiety, and fear. My parents gave me stuff I wanted but were pretty ignorant when it came to my mental health issues. They thought I would outgrow my behaviors or treat me the same way they treated my brothers. Thinking about it now, numerous reg flags were there. I was very defiant and scared of a lot of things. Many of them irrational. I remember being in like junior high and my mother telling me to get something from the car while we were at a family friends party. It was dark already and I took one look outside, saw the car parked across the street and got scared. Idk of what but my mind told me to be scared. I asked my friend to come with me but she didn’t want to and I think she was scared too because it was dark. I go back to my mom who is talking to her friends and tell her I’m scared and “(friend) doesn’t want to go with me.  I don’t want to go to the car” (friends mom was in the circle of friends like 10 of them and I was hoping she would make her go with me (I know subtle tattletale, in junior high too...currently cringing)) and my mom ended up going with me to the car. I didn’t think much of this but the next day my dad told me that one of the parents called me a spoiled brat as soon as I left with my mom to the car. Looking back I should have told my mom personally but I didn’t think it would matter since the people we were surrounded by were childhood friends who knew me at a young age. 

Growing up in my house was overall not good emotionally. Lots of instability with my father’s moods and sometimes my mother’s. I ended up being a rude child and would get angrily reprimanded by my parents (sometimes physically even if it didn’t hurt...it still did...if that makes sense). I remember saying goodbye to my parents friends (at their friends house) by just waving the off in an “eh” manner (I tried to be cute and joke with them...also I was half tired) my parents pushed me to hug them and kiss them (cultural thing) but I was just like “meh” and didn’t. I didn’t realize I was embarrassing my parents and their friends. I came off as rude. I was like 12 or 13 at the time. As soon as we got into the car my dad exploded in anger and shouted at me to never do that again. He said this while also putting his fist to my knee banging on my knee every time I didn’t give a coherent “yes” to him when he told me to never act that way again. I was in tears. I really didn’t think anything of my actions. Looking back, yeah it is rude of me but I don’t think they was the correct parental way to go about things. 

There were many instances like this. Where I would come off rude and anxious especially when I didn’t get my way with things. Forcing my friends to play with me when they didn’t want to. Telling on them to their older siblings hoping they would make their sibling play with me only to be told “she doesn’t want to play with you. That’s not my problem”, picking fights with my siblings, screaming and shouting loud enough that the neighbors can hear me... 

I was recently diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, and ADHD. In addition to my MDD, OCD, and GAD. I feel like a light just switched on this year and made me go “oh wow I really wasn’t a normal kid”.

tldr: to a lot of people growing up I came off as an annoying brat but after analyzing a lot of my behaviors and my upbringing as an adult, I now realize it was possibly a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues.",30Apr2020,1
245,"I’ve always been a lonely kid, and even as an adult I’m still lonely. I’ve had one friend all my life, and I’ve struggled with both depression and anxiety too. I also had medical issues when I was a kid, so I think I used my imagination as an escape and at first I thought it was normal for a little kid to use their “imagination” this much, but it got progressively worse. I would start making up scenarios/stories about tv shows I watched or books I’ve read and started to involve myself into the plot. Like for example: when I listen to songs I zone out and imagine myself as them or imagine myself doing something that involves that song, and it happens every single time. I try to stop it but I can’t. Also when I sleep at night it takes me a good 2 hours before I actually fall asleep because my mind is coming up with different stories.

248,"I like to think that I’m fine since it’s so easy to push everything into the back of my mind and mask my feelings and emotions until it all explodes out of control like a raging fireball. 

Ultimately though, I know for a fact I am mental unstable, incapable of feeling real emotions. Hell, my auntie past away last year, I didn’t even cry, i carried her coffin and i didn’t even well up. She was my God Mother, the only person who really stood up to my Mum when she made me do all the dishes at 5 years old, when she would beat me for no reason. Why couldn’t I cry? Seriously, that shit brakes me inside while I sit there with blank face. 

My upbringing wasn’t pleasant, single mum raising me, beating me, putting cigarettes out on my arm when the ashtray was on the opposite side of her. 

“Oops, sorry son.” With that fucking witch grin. She hated me and it got worse when my sister was born. Any frustration she had with the new born was taken out in violence on me. 

She’s crying and won’t stop? A beating.
She’s annoying her. A beating. 
She’s woke up crying in the middle of the night. Woken up by a beating.

Shit, the stuff she uses to come out with:

“If you where born second, I’d of loved you more”.
“I used black magic to get pregnant and I got you, the devils spawn”.
“If you don’t find the keys before I do, you need to run away and never come back”. Oh and low and behold she found those keys, unlocked that door and pushed me out. “Go on then, run away.”

I ran so far, at 6 I didn’t even know where I was, I’d ran up a hill only to fall down, cut my leg and helped by a Stranger who called the police. When I was returned to her. She commented “I told him to go and play, not run away.” Chatting that manipulative stuff to the police. 

Anyway, Social services got involved and I was given to my Dad at 7. He did the best, but he was a thug and a drug dealer. He bought me a puppy and left me on my own every weekend. Then when the dog didn’t comply to his commands he kicked her out the house. Made her a stray, and bought me another. This time he got lucky and it obeyed him as well as me. So we kept her. 

Fast forward to age 11, he got with a 19 year old, considering he was 31 it was ridiculous in my eyes. But she became his world and for a year I had no new things, no new clothes. But she was given everything. 

One day I asked for a cheat code system for my GBA and got told “no, I don’t have the money.”. It was 15 pound. Later that same day, he bought an engagement for her. Price tag of 2500 pounds... priorities hey.

Social services got involved again and I was made to live with my great Aunt, my mother’s Aunt. She was loving and caring, but I couldn’t give her that level of love back. I didn’t know how to, still don’t. She’s the closest thing to a mother and at 26 I can’t even say “love you” down the phone without it feeling unnatural and forced. 

The point to this post is to this day I’ve not been happy in any relationship I’ve been in, never been happy in any of the multiple careers I’ve tried. Am I just purely damaged goods? I’ve considered suicide on more that a few occasions, and all it leads to is inquisitive cutting, I wonder what place will make me bleed more. I wonder why this area scars but this doesn’t. Should I just do it? Will I ever be happy. Hell, I have a girl right now who loves me unconditionally. An all I can do is moan at everything she does, I self sabotage and never learn cause I lack empathy and emotions.

I just want to be perfect. Perfectly sound of mind, perfectly able to perform a great career, body that is close to human perfection. But I can’t achieve anything. I’m a failure, I’m damaged goods. 

My mother is still out there, she works for child protection service now. Strange, she clearly has a record against herself. So how? 

If you’re still here, thanks for reading. I’ve had this all in my head for 26 years and cannot tell my family how damaged I am. I don’t want to appear weak. I don’t want family, friends and people I think I care about to question my ability to be normal. It feels good to get this out there.",30Apr2020,1
