0,"I know it looks and sounds bad. Everybody tell me to respect my parents but why would I if they don't respect me? So, here's the thing - I was being beaten up by my parents till I graduated primary school (I guess I was 12 back then). There were many times I had bruises for a dumb shit like inability to solve equation. Anyway, The change was iniated by my father which I'm really thankful for. Since than he's been doing his best to undo things that he and my mom did to me. HOWEVER it hasn't really helped. I've been through a rough time during the first year of secondary school. I had no friends, I spent majority of time on social media, had no passion and started going through puberty which didn't help at all. A good thing was that friends found me. I slowly stopped being a silent weirdo waiting for another response on fb, socialized ble ble ble... 

Jump to situation right now. I'm 17yo, starting 2nd year of high school in a month. There is a problem I haven't been able to solve through these last 4 years of my life. It's about keeping friends. I just can't do it. It's like I start a relationship and it's gone. It slipped away. I don't know why that happens and as much as I don't want to admit it... I feel helpless. I know it's caused by what my mom did to me cuz she has kidna similar problem but on a much higher scale but I can't cut her out of my life. Is there any way to get rid of the problem without doing drugs or murdering my momma?

 Sorry not sorry if you can't understand what I'm trying to say. Feel free to clarify in the comments. I don't want to fight my problems alone :(",31Jul2020,1
1,"OK, so until early May I was pretty good but since then so many things have pushed me further and further to the edge. First I moved back in with my extremely transphobic parents(I'm trans), I started to drift away from some super old friends and the girl I was in love with broke my heart and said she just wanted to be friends. I've tried to kill myself twice since then and I don't know, does anyone have any advice? Its bascially just gotten worse and worse since then.",31Jul2020,1

3,"She's one of the interns at work, also the second girl I've ever attempted to ask out. She had a boyfriend

I could've told the right people I was planning this and been told she has a boyfriend. But I didn't, told my co-workers who didn't know (and give me encouragement) and I had a hunch that I should at least try.

I did, I failed, maybe the third time is the charm.

Until I try a 3rd time, online dating it is",31Jul2020,1
4,"So um I wanted to rant about this because I'm honestly heartbroken. When I was 12 years old, I joined twitter (I was wayyyy too young and really shouldn't have but whatever). I met this person on twitter. She was suicidal and often would message me and we would talk so I can make her feel better. I didn't really know how but I just told her how I care about her and I love the person she is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly however I was 12 and dumb. I made a joke on twitter (I basically said ""I dont think I can date a girls because some girls are just difficult tbh"" I know it was wrong to say but I got ""cancelled"" because I was making a lesbophobic comment. I always supported the lgbtq+ community btw it was just a bad joke I shouldn't have made) So anyways, I left twitter because I felt horrible and I was having really bad panic attacks from the hate dms and hate comments I was getting. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now years later I realized that when I left twitter I also left my suicidal friend who felt like she already didn't have anybody. I feel so bad now because I feel like I failed her and should have just stayed. I haven't thought about it before but now I do and it makes me so sad because what if she's not on the earth right now, just because I got hurt when I got hate over a joke I MADE.",31Jul2020,1

6,My family doesn’t know so I can’t really tell them. I think it might be PTSD but I don’t want to self diagnose. I get very anxious and out of breath.

7,"During quarantine, I was doing pretty good mentally but because it’s been getting closer to school, my outlook on life is getting pretty bleak again. I guess I’m just realizing that high school is almost over and reality is hitting me. I’ve kind of thought of the future but I’ve never even imagined my life past, like, 25 because I didn’t think I’d make it. I can’t imagine myself with a husband and kids because I don’t know if that life is for me + I think pretty little of myself so I don’t even know if someone would love me enough to spend the rest of their fucking life with me. Also, I don’t like kids. I’m pretty sure I’m bisexual but having a wife is laughable because I have Asian/Muslim parents. I don’t talk to my dad, but he’s very traditional, and my mom is pretty disgusted by LGBT+ people. I think I’m Muslim but a bisexual Muslim sounds pretty fucking stupid. I’ve always thought of myself as smart but now I’m starting to realize how little I actually matter in this world. I want to be happy again like I was in quarantine but I can’t help but think of life as pointless when school’s coming around + the future seems really fucking unrewarding and meaningless. I guess I’m just asking on how I can catch myself from slipping back into the depression I was during sophomore year (I’m about to be a junior in highschool). Isn’t it logical to not want to live if I don’t see a point in life?",31Jul2020,1
8,"How do you cope with the type of sadness where its easier to feel physical pain than to focus on the emotions inside you? The type of sadness that eats away at you at night? The type of sadness that has you daydreaming about running away forever without looking back, leaving behind those that you love and all your precious belongings? 

I consider myself a deeply sad person, despite how I act/appear to my family and friends... I'm not depressed. I have friends with depression, but I know what I feel is not that. Instead its like the sadness is a storm and I'm just living in it. Its not something that's apart of me (per-say) but instead something I'm being haunted by...

I'm in therapy and my therapist knows that I'm sad but I just wish I knew better ways to cope? I feel like I need suggestions on ways to cope with these feelings...",31Jul2020,1
9,"Recently I've had some quite bad issues with some of my family, and it has gotten to the point where I have self harmed. Normally, I would tell someone I really trust about this, but if I do that now, I have a feeling that they would tell the information to other people who I don't want told, I also have a feeling that they would keep an extremely close eye on me, and knowing someone is watching me, even if it is for a good reason, sets of my anxiety.

Should I bring this up to anyone, and if I do, how should I go about it? Any help would be appreciated.",31Jul2020,1
10,"Well, about 2 months ago my ex dumped me, she was the girl I considered the love of my life, I had future plans with her, I liked her since we were children and the pleasure of hanging out with her lasted little.  Well, around the same time I had a trip to Europe and was very excited about it, and fucking Covid made that trip impossible.  Then my high school graduation canceled.

 I have not seen anyone who is not from my family for two months, I am overwhelmed not to go out, I would like to be alone or with friends (which are very few with whom I speak).

 I really have the worst mood in the world right now, for whatever they tell me to do I get upset.

 A month and a half ago I had to come to live (although I will only be two months I guess) in another city, where the heat is overpowering and I hate the heat, also I have not been able to play video games with my friends.

 My sleep schedule is screwed up, I have insomnia at night, I end up sleeping around 4:30 AM and wake up until 2PM.

 The only productive thing that I feel I do is to exercise, but sometimes I feel that it is useless, I am still just as skinny

11,"Hello, I am looking for advice for how I can help support my sister. My apologies if this is the wrong subreddit for this.

She just found out that her freshman year of college is going to be completely online and shes going to have to keep living at home with our parents for the next few months. I'm really worried about her mental health not only because shes going to be very isolated as her friends go off to college and shes stuck at home, but also because my parents are borderline emotionally abusive and put a lot of pressure on her. Shes expressed to me that she cant handle spending another 3 months with them but I feel helpless because I'm going to a different city in a month for a job. I'd suggest she could get herself an apartment but I dont think it's in the cards right now...

14,"This is pretty long so read at your own risk lol, but I wasn’t feeling too good after a long shift so I decided to let write a little in my phone notes (and then decided to post it). It’s a three part system that I use to bring myself out of a rut when I start to go in a bad direction mentally. It’s a little cheesy but it works for me. I’m just venting the first two paragraphs so you can skip those if you want.

——————————————————————-
I’m a very paranoid person sometimes so I ask myself about a thousand “what if” questions a day, I’m the Mozart of concocting ridiculous “what if’s” to psych myself out. My biggest one that I throw around the most though is “what if something stupid happens to me one day and I die way too soon”. I’m not really afraid of death, I’m afraid that I’ll die too early and miss out on a lot. 

Right now I’m at one of the lowest points in my life so far, I have mostly bad days. My addictions keep me up and running, nothing serious though. Caffeine, nicotine, and way too much weed. Though I worry about my lung health I know I’m better off not taking anxiety or depression meds, I’ve taken so many before that really screwed me up. Sliding around back to my main point, even though I’m scraping by, I’m still able to manage my functioning on a day to day basis.

The secret is being grateful and living day to day, taking things one step at a time and really learning how your mind works. There’s three parts to the secret. It’s going to sound stupid and way too simple but it works along with the other parts, the first step is simply to be grateful. Not only grateful for the obvious things like family, friends, a meal to eat and a roof over your head, but really get creative with it. I’m thankful I have all my senses, or I’m thankful I have all my limbs or even all my fingers and toes.

The second step is two in one, living day to day and taking things one step at a time. At first glance it might seem like I’m trying to just completely write off any plans for the future, but that’s not the case. Have your life goals and ambitions planned out, and have a method to start working on those plans. The second step is only worrying about “what can I do now?” and then getting started on whatever it is. One piece of advice that I’ve been hearing recently from multiple people is “find something your passionate about and really grind out 5-10 years in whatever it is and you can do amazing things”. That’s really stuck with me.

The last step is to really get to know how your mind works. This step is more useful for people suffering from mental disorders rather than people who’re just going through hard times. After going through a few episodes of depression I’m able to tell when it’s starting to happen earlier and earlier (when my mind is starting to go in that direction). As soon as you get the first little signal take action before things start to get worse. If your issues never got that bad start an exercise regimen and try to find a support system and something new to be passionate about. If your problems get more serious (like me) go and talk to a professional as soon as possible along with everything else.

All three of these things combined has helped me bounce back from so many low points in my life and actually start to feel better again. Going through a pretty low point right now, I wanted to let off some steam and write this out. Writing is one of the things I’m really passionate about",31Jul2020,1
15,"I read so many posts about how sad, lonely and suicidal people are. How much pain they carry. 

I think what we should focus on is to let that pain go. If we hurt we should give that hurt to others who ""need"" it. 

For example i love my parents but they traumatized me and did a pretty poor job at bringing up a child who will be able to take care of himself. But i keep in touch with them and i understand them more and more, i see that they are good people. They trigger me all the time but i find ways how to look at things in other ways. So what i saw is that when they trigger me they actually trigger themselves because that pain i hold in me is from them. Their traumas and fears. Since they filled me with that so much when they talk about it (even thought they aren't talking directly about it, they talk in a learned mechanism with certain sentences, questions and behavior). For example when i talk to my father about my life and what i do he always tries to change the ""mistakes"" i do (that's how he sees it). Last time i disarmed his disbelief, i asked a few questions when he started questioning me and caught him saying something that isn't his true self. He said i was right and said he will be able to sleep well now (he wasn't able to sleep because he worried about me).

I see i made some mistakes in the text and some sentences aren't finished but i wrote as i thought and i think every information here could be of use. Just look at every sentence as a thought you could think about. 

What i want to say about pain is that you can let go of it, it isn't yours. You made it yours, to be honest it can stay yours, but it doesn't have to. It would be easier on you if it wasn't only yours. If you have a recurring memory share it with the ones involved or with someone, anyone... It doesn't matter. I believe we are all one so then it really doesn't matter.",31Jul2020,1
16,"I’ve worked in healthcare for about 3 years. My office sees tons of mentally disabled folks, ranging from high function to totally nonverbal and everyone in between. I love these patients and have a great rapport with most of them and their “staff” or caregivers.

Today I had a patient come in who needed 3 staff with them at all times. I had never seen this patient before, but I wasn’t worried. My coworker had seen this patient once previously and said I would be fine with them, as I was with all our similar patients. The patient was brought back by one large man and 2 women. The patient breaks their grasp and immediately grabs me by the collar of my scrubs and YANKS me toward them, trying to bite. It happened so fast. All three staff had to quickly reach to pull their hand away and wrap them in their security blanket. 

After this happened, I couldn’t stop my hands from shaking. Even though I wasn’t really physically harmed, it was so quick and jolting it was like I went into fight or flight. A coworker asked me if I was alright (patient and staff were gone at this point) and I almost started bawling. My coworker took me outside for a few minutes so I could relax.

I felt so unbelievably stupid. I am usually the go to person at my office for our disabled patients. I feel like if I had more forewarning of how strong and unpredictable this patient was I could’ve been better prepared. I felt blindsided and I also felt bad for my patient, because it wasn’t their fault and they had no idea what they were doing. Just a sad and shitty situation. Just needed to vent.",31Jul2020,1
17,"I'm really really struggling right now in more ways than one. I've been struggling for years after childhood emotional trauma that never really got resolved outside me taking myself out of my childhood and thus my trauma altogether. Two years later and I'm with my boyfriend who I feel like I'm selfishly using as an emotional crutch. I can tell it's getting tedious for him. But then again, I'm not really the best person to judge anything right now. Literally every thought or concept seems tainted by my constant misery and I'm struggling to cope with it. I've tried meditation, I've spoken about my feelings with so many people now that quite frankly, I'm so done with my stupid little pity party that I've thrown myself.  

My life currently revolves completely around my boyfriend. My best friend of 15 years is moving away and I won't see her much before she leaves because of the pandemic. I am estranged from the family I was raised by and never really developed a bond with the side of my family who I wasn't really able to see much as a child. They're no longer interested in building a bond, they have their own bustling lives to occupy themselves with.  

I'm an artist at heart, as a child it used to me something that calmed me - now I struggle to paint unless I'm in a positive mood. I haven't typically had one of those moods for months. I've tried to force myself to paint again to no avail. I've been furloughed from my job though I never particularly enjoyed bartending anyway. I can't distract myself anymore. 

My boyfriend seems to be desensitized to me crying, it's a common occurrence. I'm hard to be with right now, I'm sensitive and quick to take things to heart, quick to overthink simple factors of life than don't require such. Over the past week, he seems to be struggling. He isn't happy, he's impatient, snappy and generally in a bad mood. Though I've feigned the bubbly woman he fell in love with, I can't get him out of it. I can't help him because I can't help myself which is antagonized by the fact that he can't help me. I've never been angry before. As a child and into adulthood I've always been passive. When I've been 'done wrong' I become frustrated and then I cry it out and move on. For the first time, this week, I've found myself angry. I've never been violent but I want to scream, throw shit across the room. This feeling comes in a brief burst before I cry... once again. As if that motif wasn't boring yet. 

I'm stuck. I no longer have energy to argue with my boyfriend anymore and not know what I'm even arguing about. I no longer have the energy to spend nights hoping this will get better. I feel so distant from my boyfriend and he is so distant from me. Don't get me wrong, we have our moments of being in mutual comfort, we have moments of laughter. But it just feels different now, I feel far away from it all. But I'm tied into a routing of continuing to keep this going, because If I don't - I know I will have nothing at all. I'll go back to being consumed by loneliness, and what then? I know what will inevitably happen because I've thought about it nearly every night for the past three months or so. 

I'm not really asking for advise I don't think, just someone to hear me.",31Jul2020,1

We can only know it from the observers perspective, and the thought of the process from the actor terrifies me. Right now, I am just thinking that it is nothingness, and that is terrifying to me. I really don't know what to do anymore, because this past week, my mind would just drift to it, and I'd get an overwhelming sense of dread, an inability to do anything, and just start crying. My girlfriend has tried to help, saying that it's not any different from before you were born, but to me it is different, because I had no experiences before I was born, so the argument does nothing for me. I really don't know what to do and have no clue how to proceed at all with my life. I can come up with reason after reason to try to keep living my life. To improve the world for others; to try to experience as much as possible; etc. But it doesn't matter. The dread returns and overpowers any reasons or other feelings.

I've tried once before to talk to him after he made a Reddit post about considering suicide, but I just wasn't sure what to say, so it ended up coming out ignorant.

I'm a current student in the midst of my Respiratory Therapy program. My girlfriend who is a Physical Therapy Assistant volunteered to be in the covid wing at her Nursing home facility. In Michigan, because hospitals were so stacked up they started putting COVID patients in nursing homes. Almost every patient my girlfriend encountered died. On top of being secluded, her grandfather passed away of (not confirmed) COVID. He was 96 years old, but it is awfully suspicious he died at this time. Anyways, my girlfriend does not work in her COVID wing anymore and hasn't for sometime. However, everyday she comes home crying. A germaphobia has taken over her mind. The fear of germs or blood or if she has an infection and we can't have kids. She's not eating, she barely sleeps because of possibilities running in her mind. She just started taking some anti depressants her doctor gave her and she is going to start speaking with someone soon. If anyone has any tips for anything I can do at home to make sure she eats please let me know.",31Jul2020,1

So I was on TikTok like I always am and I’m just watching videos. I always see videos of girls dancing to viral songs. There are TONS of girls on TikTok with thousands of followers, as young as 15, dancing in front of the camera wearing a bikini or really skimpy clothing. I thought to myself, “What is this doing to their brain?” To a girl who is very young and never had a job, 100k followers to them is a huge accomplishment, but all they had to do is put on a bikini and dance for the world to see them. To them, this is what makes them feel successful at that moment. But the only thing that gave them that success is showing off their body to tons of people, and a majority of their audience is men. They will grow up thinking that their body is their most important thing they have, but how will they react as they age? How will they feel when nobody watches their videos anymore, when at one point of their life being TikTok famous was the most important thing they ever accomplished? Are these girls who post these super revealing videos of themselves going to experience mass depression as they age? Are they going to get hooked on this type of fame and possibly move on into the porn industry? (Signing up to be a porn star is a huge decision where you can never turn back and erase your videos, you will also never live a normal life again). I’m sure it doesn’t hurt to have a funny video go viral every now and then, but to dedicate your entire account to showing off your body is another thing. We are currently living through a very interesting experiment to see how the brain reacts to the wrong type of fame to girls at such a young age. I have a bad feeling it’s not going to look so good for many of these girls unfortunately.",31Jul2020,1
32,"Following college graduation, I immediately started a corporate job with a fast-paced, high-pressure consulting firm. Upon landing the job, I felt on top of the world because it came with an incredibly competitive salary and benefits package. I followed every rule business school taught me and it got me the job I thought I wanted.

A year later I found myself working 70+ hours (no overtime pay), vomiting during the workday from anxiety and panic attacks, and nearly fantasizing about ending my life.

It felt like I had been lied to. I wasn’t providing anything valuable, just grinding myself to the bone over some documents a group of execs would look at for 2 minutes max. I found myself questioning if I was truly put on this earth JUST to be a PowerPoint and Excel monkey for the next 30-40 years. I genuinely felt worthless, despite the generous paycheck I received.

It all got to a breaking point during COVID when I stopped eating due to stress, started heavily dissociating during Zoom meetings, and lost it when I genuinely couldn’t recognize myself in the mirror. My partner had to help calm me down for hours (bless his heart) until I could explain that I didn’t feel like a part of myself anymore. That statement isn’t exaggerated, I was in a completely depersonalized state.

I am now using FMLA with my psychologists approval, and although I’m not getting paid, I am finally able to focus on myself. Turns out not only do I have depression and anxiety (I’ve known this for years), but I primarily struggle with CPTSD and a Dissociative Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified.

At the end of the day, if your mental health is suffering your quality of work is going to suffer too. Something business school didn’t teach me is to pursue the things that make you happy, because money won’t always make you happy. (I want to acknowledge that this statement comes from a place of privilege. For a lot of folks their income is exclusively dedicated to keeping food on the table and the lights on. While money is a necessity, it doesn’t make a shitty boss, project, position any less shitty, especially if your mental health is taking a hard hit).

So today I applied for a position at my favorite non-profit in hopes of finding what truly makes me happy, because for me life is about using my time on this earth to put good energy into the world.

TLDR; I started a high-pressure job right out of college and it led to my psychological decline. I used FMLA to take a Medical Leave of Absence which has been the healthiest choice for me. Corporate jobs are not the pinnacle of success, happiness is.",31Jul2020,1
33,"I keep thinking that what if everything is just an illusion and things that I love aren’t real the way I understand them to be, what if my girlfriend doesn’t exist, what if things like my hobbies don’t exist? I can’t get out of my own head, I’ve been told just enjoy what you experience whether it’s real or not, I get that but I simply enjoy things because they’re real, or unique things. For instance I’m happy when my girlfriend is happy because I know she’s happy, if that makes sense, but if it’s all an illusion then her happiness doesn’t exist. I know it all sounds crazy but I just want out of my head. I’m also an atheist so religious advice will probably just make things worse. Thanks pals",31Jul2020,1
34,"So, I had my first therapy session today (whoo), and we went through the typical questionnaire thing for anxiety and depression. When we got to the question on thoughts of self harm and ""ending one's life"", I wasn't sure how to answer? Like it wasn't a definite no, but I haven't thought of actually doing it? It's sorta weird since it doesn't really work with they number rating system. It's more of ""oh I wish I wasn't here,"" although I habitually say ""I want to kms"" but I genuinely can't tell if that's out of a twisted habit orrr what.....

40,"Just needing advice about some general shit.. im feeling a bit lost because I'm almost 30 and I feel as though I haven't figured out anything about my mental health. At a very young age (13 or 14) I did some tests where I found out I had Depression and Anxiety. I still struggle with all of these things, but as someone who isn't great at leading a healthy lifestyle, I get very confused as to  how much of it is the actual depression, and how much of it is me needing to change my life ( to give you an idea: I am unemployed, don't have many friends relationships or a strong family dynamic, very little structure to my life, no hobbies and I have been single for two years). 

I am not in love with the idea of having to take a pill every day, but I am currently prescribed lexapro to treat my anxiety and depression.. I really have no idea if it works or not because I still feel like shit a lot of the time. But I do notice that it controls my emotions which is beneficial (I am someone who could cry if they hear one note a sad song)  

Also, I often wonder if I have borderline bipolar disorder. There are times when I feel energized and happy and social and motivated , but then usually those times fade away and I start thinking about how shitty my career and personal life are. 

Where do you guys suggest I start in tackling the issue of ""what's going on in my brain"" beyond talking to a therapist and psychiatrist ? I would rather not try a bunch of new medications, it just seems like such a hassle with the side effects and all of that etc..

45,"I have a history of depression and anxiety from the past few years stemming from PTSD and issues at home. Prior to that I was a very happy, go lucky guy with some internal issues I had been able to work through myself. After some issues at home and at work (military), I found myself having panic attacks quite often. Since I've moved back home, I have been relatively stable minus a few episodes related to really bad things that have happened but for the most part was going fine. However, since I started taking sertraline aka Zoloft almost 2 weeks ago, I have basically lost my mind. I had a panic attack today that I had ""child porn"" on my PC but I didn't. I had to go through and verify that I didn't, and a random thumbnail of a photo from 2009 that showed a woman who could have been 17 (completely irrational thought process) had me calling lawyers to make sure I didn't need to go to the local PD and ""self report"" even though I didn't do anything wrong. It was bizarre. I feel humiliated for having a psychotic episode like that in front of my dad, who is the only person who has ever really had my back. Everything in life is getting worse. My wife is like a stranger to me now (we no longer live together due to her own issues), I have no job and I am now disabled to a point where I can't do much anyway. I can't walk very far or well at all without pain, my friends just don't really want to be around me anymore, and life just really sucks. I have weird hang ups about sexual things now (beating off, etc) and that is weird as fuck to me but it's like if I do it or experience any sexual feeling it's some weird shameful act. I feel like I have two sides of my brain: the ""left"" side that is me, normal me. And the much more powerful ""right side"" that is destroying me. 

I want to give up so bad. I've been fighting physical issues since I was 20 years old and mental ones since I was 24 or so. I do not see a light at the end of the tunnel. I don't see any value to myself. I'm not suicidal at all but I do not want to live. I'm not a danger to myself but I do wish I was dead because I consider my life a lost cause. I want to seek help at a residential treatment facility but the help I need, I'm afraid doesn't exist or is too expensive. I have no insurance other than the VA which is garbage and doesn't cover shit. 

TL;Dr I'm losing the fight, if there's even any fight left. I feel like I'm going to die soon even though I want to keep going. I just don't have any fight left in me. I'm just miserable and nothing is changing it. I haven't had a panic attack like this in years and it just won't stop.",31Jul2020,1

55,"The more I think about it, the more I realize how much of my life and personality I’ve built around one thing: control. It’s true. I’m nothing without control or power. It’s such a driving force in my life that at this point I don’t know who I’d be without it. 

My struggle with my eating disorders? Control. All about controlling my weight and emotions. My calorie intake needed to be controlled and reigned in for me to feel powerful in a world without my influence.

My self harm? There’s always been one thing above all else that I can certainly control- and if it can’t be how much I eat, it’ll be how much I bleed. 

My entire high school career in the student council? I was class president. I hate everything about it but I stay. All for the control. The power over things no matter how small they are is all I’m after- I don’t care about helping my school. 

My lifelong dream of becoming a diplomat? Sure, I would likely genuinely enjoy the work I would do in that kind of position, but after this realization, I find myself wondering if I ever would have been drawn to it without the power and prestige that comes with it. 

All my decisions no matter how small are motivated by a meaningless bid for control in a world in which I’ve had none. In my life my parents, my friends, my family, my community and country have always taken away the control and organization I’ve had about myself so my motivation in so much has come down to regaining that. Without the desire for control, without the motivation it gives me, what am I? What am I without the ego, the base desire for power, and the courage to lie and manipulate for that end? 

It’s all hit me at once like a sack of bricks that this is what my life has been. What if my therapist tries to take that away? What if he tries to tell me that that’s unnatural? I’ll be nothing without the one thing that’s motivated me my whole life. 

Am I a bad person? Logically I’ve never done anything horrible to reach my ends, but what of that matters if I’ve never had good intentions. 

I’m so lost all of the sudden. One moment ago I had everything figured out in life, but now I’m struggling to stay afloat amid this existential crisis. Fml.

so basically i’m 17, i have anxiety and depression and suspected ADHD/ADD 
i’ll do bullets 
•my mom is very very religious &amp; is forcing me to get baptized, i’m atheist and i’m very scared of her finding out and how she would react 
•my mom and possibly my dad are in denial that i have depression , both are definetly in denial that i have ADHD, not allowing me to get a psychological evaluation that my psychiatrist recommended (i could probably convince them but it would take a lot of time/effort/seems like i actually WANT another mental illness???) 
•they ask me to describe my ADHD like- symptoms and brush off the descriptions i give them 
•my mom is an immigrant and super against medicine and believes that psychiatrists are corrupt and diagnose you with whatever you claim you have and just give out pills to anyone to make cash 
•she always makes my pain about herself. (TW)when i self harmed, all she could talk about is how hurt SHE was and how worried SHE was
•when she found out about my two piercings she said she wouldn’t support me anymore if i did stuff like that , and started crying in a restaurant and wouldn’t talk to me and just cried all day 
•when i bleached my hair she was so upset and basically told me i looked ugly 
•when i bleached my eyebrows she cried and basically told me i looked ugly 
•it’s super clear that she’s ashamed of me, she’s embarrassed of my looks now and won’t let me resume my job until i dye my eyebrows back to normal 

so yeah , now that i write it down it does seem pretty bad. i want to move across the country for college which is coming up, and my mom does not want to let me go, she believes i’m not mature and responsible enough for it. which i guess is fair. i’ve been arrested, snuck out to go to protests, and she found me blackout drunk in the kitchen when i was depressed once. i’ve had my share of acting out but in the back of my mind i think it’s because of how she treats me. 

she and my dad always get mad at me for not wanting a solid secure job (i want to do something in the arts) . i eavesdropped on them talking once and they are going to hide from me that i have inheritance from my grandpa who passed recently and convince (more like prohibit) me from going anywhere for college. 


i tell my friends these things and they are always shocked , they and their family always offers if i want to live with them . it’s weird because it doesn’t feel toxic at all , it just feels normal i’m so used to it, so i don’t know what to do.

but at the same time i’m really grateful that my parents made a stable life for me in a good area and i have a roof over my head and food and clothes. they say they love me and always are there for me but i don’t know. 

i have an opportunity to move away early, across the country where i wanna be. i am debating if i should leave them or stay. i don’t know if this is the regular ups and downs of a family . 

i love my dad though i wouldn’t want to do anything to hurt him and he’s done so much for me . i don’t know what to do. sorry this is so so long but it’s just a lot i’ve been holding in. anything would be so so appreciated , i hope all of u have a good day &lt;3",31Jul2020,1

61,"Once when it was like 10pm, i usually go to bed at 9.15ish with my sibling. I was having REALLY REALLY bad anxiety about what if i had cancer... like REALLY bad. And i was trying to calm myself down and i do this by talking to myself in my head.

I thought of the thought first and said it to myself so i could hear it in my head and i could calm down, as i was finishing one of my sentences, the last word was 'fine' and as i was approaching the word ""fine"" and as i was saying it in my head, simultaneously i heared a female voice say something like ""fine"".

I remember panicking, looking at my sister who was asleep and then i was thinking about how im now schizophrenic. It sounded so dreamlike, its like how it is when a sound wakes you up... except i think it was the word ""fine"". ( i dont remember the actual word as it was so quick, this is an example)

Anyway i went to sleep and i think either that week or the week after, i was in class.... staring at a wall, ruminating in anxiety, my mind going blank and me zoning out. My classroom was noisy but i didnt pay attention to the sound. 

Again just as i was repeating a phrase to myself to calm my anxiety down... i heared a male voice again finishing the last word to my sentence simultaneously as i said it in my head. I knew it was in my head as again it was translike.

To hear sounds when falling asleep or waking up is very normal (even voices) but mine was when i was zoning in and out, from one deep state of concentration and out of it....

64,"Hi all, thanks for clicking the post.  First time poster, and fair warning, I don’t really know what my intended goal is in posting this.  Guess I just needed to let it out.  I know this might sound pretentious, but what I do know is I can’t really stand the comments of “it’ll be okay,” or “just chin up haha,” or “I know the feel,” they don’t help.

I am 22.  Man if it’s at all telling I’m struggling to put the words down on here, and not for lack of trying I just really don’t know what it is I want to say (took me 40 minutes to write this whole post).  I really don’t want to give much of a background aside from the fact that I used to be so extroverted it (didn’t) hurt.  Couldn’t stand being alone.  Life of the party type.  I’ve experienced a lot in life.  Addiction, homelessness, heartbreak, estrangement of a parent.  All said, I still grew up in a privileged upper-middle class home (parents split when I was two).

I should say that I don’t feel sad anymore, I don’t think.  I felt very sad and in a very deep pit about 3 years ago.  It’s been about 4 years since my loneliness began.  I don’t have friends, I have my father and brother who live in a different state than I.  I do indeed work and although it’s nice to get out of the house I feel as though I can’t relate to anyone there.  

The real and thick of it is that I feel as though I’m okay being alone — if not for good.  Truthfully my plan / dream is to buy a cabin and a plot of land and live there alone til I perish.  I want to want things so bad.  I want to want friends, I want to want a better future for me.  I want to enjoy things.  I’ve tried different lines of thought, be it CBT (on my own, yet to really give therapy a whirl though it is in the cards), stoic lines of thought, I’ve tried writing... if any of them worked the way I wanted them to, I’d not be writing this right now.  Of course they all have helped in their own rite, I am in complete control of my emotions and rarely if ever feel an extreme of any one emotion.  I’m able to grapple with how I am feeling at any given time.  All these things, yet I still am so complacent in the things I am and the situation I am in.  It’s worth noting that even with these benefits I still experience suicidal ideation (or perhaps it’s just the call of void).  In this ideation, I am completely conscious of the thought and again, never in an extreme emotional state.  I’d never act on these thoughts I don’t think as I have stated, I do have a plan or goal I’d like to reach.  

I try and enjoy things but I really can’t.  I want to write, but can’t write for more than 5 minutes a week.  I enjoy playing guitar but even this I find myself doing less and less.  I don’t know.  I don’t feel like this is normal, but I can’t be sure.  I’m just hoping others out there will share their experiences in this regard with me.  I do indeed plan to go to school in the fall, though my lack of vision prevents me from realizing what it is I want to do (and I have of course been soul searching for the last five years).

65,"I’ve been struggling a lot with my mental health lately. But the thing is I can’t even say this out loud. Because growing up, I was told not to “seek attention” “create symptoms” “ pity yourself” or simply “don’t be such a baby.” I may be overreacting to things going on with my life ( which is again something I was taught when I was a kid, your problems are never serious, people have a lot worse going on and you’re just overreacting- which is usually true but it keeps me from expressing my feelings and just be sad sometimes).

I used to think I had many people around me that I could just talk to, but then I realized none of them were really there for me when I needed help even though I was there for them the whole time (maybe it’s my fault for not asking their help, idk)

I am sad. I am very sad. I know I have to be grateful for everything in my life and I am, I swear to god I am so thankful for those things. But I just feel sad. And I feel like I’m being an ungrateful baby when I feel like this.

I’m 19 and I am sad. This shouldn’t be such a big deal. I have bad stuff going on in my life right now, I have no clue how my future is going to turn out or if I will ever get a life that’s my own. *This feels like a load of shit when I actually say it.* 

You know, There’s this voice in my head that says “there are people that are dying Kim” every time I feel even slightly bad. lol. Like look at me, I should be the last person to complain about life.

so yeah moral of the story/non-story please if anyone ever tells you about how they’re feeling, just let them be. Just let them say the most stupidest thing on earth. Because none of us can control our feelings and I can assure you it sucks not being able to embrace your feelings.

I think I’m done for today, i’m reading this whole thing and am really sorry for you if you have come this far. And also, thank you.

Also, a note for my future self reading this and thinking what a baby I was: *couldn’t think of anything that would convince me lol, so like just don’t be harsh on yourself because of how you feel. it’s not the end of the world to be a baby, they’re cute creatures.*",31Jul2020,1

67,"My life is falling apart. I have been having problems with my mental health for about 1.5 years and it’s getting worse every day. The way I feel has changed from to time, sometimes I’m empty, very sad, angry, or even suicidal. I don’t care about my life anymore and I don’t care if I die. I used to cut but I stopped in April because things were getting better for a bit but I’ve been doing it again pretty often. I can barely sleep and my appetite is always very little or very large. I try to go to bed but just end up cutting and crying myself to sleep hours after I try to fall asleep originally most nights.

One of my friends figured out that I was having problems and I told him some of the stuff that happened but I can’t open up to anyone completely, even though I know they’re there to help me. Nothing really gives me pleasure anymore and things I enjoyed a lot like video games don’t make me happy anymore. I do things only because i have nothing else to do or because I want to be away from others. My days are mostly being alone in my room or playing video games with other people because there’s nothing for me to do. I’m a teenager and I want help but I don’t want to tell anyone that I know and i don’t want anyone from my family to know so I don’t know who to talk to. 

I’ve been hiding how I feel for so long because I don’t want anyone to worry about me and I’m tired of it, I’m always pretend that everything is ok but it’s not. I hate my life and I don’t care about it. I know I need help but I don’t know what to do about it. Whenever I feel happy it lasts for almost no time and I want to change it but I don’t know how to.

I have been suffering with my mental health for as long as I can remember. However, my mental health has always been suffering with severe depression, typical social anxiety, and PTSD. I have felt sad and down in my life, as well as scared and traumatized; however, not until recently have i feared that I am actually going crazy. 

Over the past two years I have began to have episodes of dissacotiation, they never lasted long and my councilor was able to diagnose them pretty quick and help me deal with it. And due to covid I had to stop getting the adequate mental health supports i need. 

Over the past few months these episodes have gotten more intense and scary, lasting longer and longer every time. It has morphed into an experience of feeling I am not real, that my actions and words are not my own, my senses become completely weakened (hard to hear, feel, or speak), and it feels that I am stuck in a dream world that is not mine and I am not me. This has lead to multiple mental breakdowns that have lead to me, begging to go to the hospital (my mom has told me the hospital won't help me and due to that, no one has taken me) 

I nearly have these episodes daily. I can't function like this. It feels like its taking everything in me, not to turn into a crazy person. And I can't live like this. 

The problem is, is that due to covid i have to wait a matter of months to receive any help... im afraid I can't wait that long. Does anyone else suffer from this??? Do you have any advice??

79," When we sleep, a lot of things happen in our head, and it is the brain’s activity that causes sleep to have such steps.

Sleep has two cycles: NREM (Non-Rapid Eye Movement) and REM.

**The NREM cycle is divided into four stages:**

**Stage 1 is the beginning of sleep. Breathing becomes slow; heart rate is steady, brain electric waves delays, the amplitude is small and a little less regular. The sleeper is easily awake and may not be able to sleep again, waking up until he is too tired to fall asleep.**

**Stage 2 lasts about 20 minutes. People who sleep may be consciously discrete but cannot see anything even when their eyes are open. The body function drops. The brain waves now slow down, have a larger amplitude, and sometimes there are bursts of rapid waves, the eyes don’t move, the heart rate, the breathing rate slows down. The person who sleeps may still be awake by the sounds.**

**In stages 3 and 4, this is a deep sleep phase, in which, we sleep deeper. In these two stages, slow brain waves, or delta waves, begin to rise. During this period, people have little reaction to noise and activity outside the environment. It is also called the** ***transitional period*** **between deep sleep and deep sleep. People who suffer from urination while sleeping (bed-piss) or sleepwalking may be bothered by their illness at the end of stage 4.** 

**If we wake up in step 4, it often takes us a few minutes to “calm down.” again, in other words, we are disoriented for a few minutes.**

**During the NREM cycle, the body recovers and regenerates cells as well as muscles and bones. It is the cycle during which the immune system is strengthened.**

**When stage 4 ends, the REM cycle begins. REM sleep is the stage of sleep when the brain is actively working and dreaming occurs. During REM sleep, your eyes will rush, shallow breathing, and your heart rate and blood pressure may increase. During this stage, your arms and legs will also become numb. The amount of REM sleep depends on your age and other factors.**

**Increasing REM sleep time has been shown to enhance memory recall and overall mental capacity, especially for young children. You will also have vivid dreams during the REM sleep phase of the sleep cycle, and you expect these dreams to continue each night.**

**Sleepers will be alternating between REM and NREM (non-REM) sleep 4 – 6 times a night, with each cycle lasting an average of 90 minutes and fluctuating between 70 and 110 minutes. During the night, the time you spend on each stage will change. Most deep sleep takes place during the first half of the night. After that, your REM sleep phase will get longer.**

**People often think of sleep as a passive behavior, but research has shown that the brain works quite actively during different stages of sleep. Sleep plays an essential role in several other processes, such as memory consolidation and brain cleansing. This is your 1st level of understanding the science of sleep**

80,"I wrote a post yesterday about my own journey as a therapist, and the struggle life can be for all of us. From my position of knowing a little bit of being a person and some things that might help, I want to share some thoughts that I think are healthy, useful, and applicable, and might help you be happier with yourself and your life.

Here's yesterday's post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/i0inqj/accepting\_who\_you\_are\_such\_a\_clich%C3%A9\_and\_yet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/i0inqj/accepting_who_you_are_such_a_clich%C3%A9_and_yet/) 

&amp;#x200B;

# 1. You are being mind-controlled, by society, the people around you, and most importantly yourself.

We have all sorts of beliefs that we believe so strongly that we can barely let go of it. And yet, if we want to be genuinely happy and at ease with ourselves, we need to make an effort and be brave. We need to combat this mind-control. Not with aggression, but with awareness, and a determination to let it go and change.

What mind control am I talking about? Ideas about 'ought'. Whether it relates to body image, financial success, professional success, having lots of friends, having a relationship, whatever. There is no truth to be found no matter what the stories in society are telling you.

For me body image was a biggy. I used to be quite overweight when I was young. I lost a lot of the weight, but I have the genetics to be not very muscular and to store some really stubborn fat on my stomach. I don't want to have to combat the way I naturally am just to be acceptable to society. To be muscular enough as a guy 'ought to be', to have a flat stomach because I 'ought to', because I will never be accepted by other people or get a partner if I don't look a certain way. These are deeply destructive terrible tendencies that we cannot allow to happen inside of us.

# 2. You are perpetuating mind-control and unhappiness through your own judgments of others.

Whatever it is you are judging others for; not smart, crooked teeth, yellow teeth, balding, thin hair, beard, no beard, hairy back, wide hips, short, tall, overweight, underweight, too perfect weight. This mind-control apparatus inside of us will find something to complain about and judge others for. Usually the themes are the same as with yourself. 

You cannot heal yourself without being accepting and kind to others. If you allow your judgments towards others, you will remain unhappy and controlled by the judgments. So here too, we need to set an intention, and make a conscious effort. When we do judge, especially when we voice the judgments, we need to correct it. Not just to mend relationships, but also to counter the aggression internally. Say you're sorry and you disagree with what you just said, you're trying to change your judgmentality.

# 3. Know what your needs are.

This doesn't mean that it is easy to follow up on your needs. Sometimes life is in the way and it's really difficult. But know what you need. Know what you want. You can then take steps. Be brave.

# 4. There's a specifically toxic idea that we find online a lot: if we are really healthy, we can be there for ourselves and by implication don't really need others.

The thinking is that we can be independent. Others can be just a nice addition to our lives but we could just as well be alone all the time and we could take care of ourselves, 'be there for ourselves', 'be our best friends.' 

This is not to say that many of us do not have something to learn here. We often don't indeed love ourselves and indeed don't take care of ourselves, as I've outlined above. However, we are a social species. At least most of us do need other people, and that's normal, that's healthy. We need to be heard, be seen, be accepted, be loved, be valued. We don't need to have the goal of being independent, and we don't need to have the goal of only loving ourselves without needing love from others.

86,"Content Warning: Discussion about suggestive ideas, sexual misconduct, and self-harm.

So I have OCD that fluctuates depending on how hard of a time I’m having in life. I wont give specific details because im paranoid that people I know will find this and give pity to me, or they’ll somehow try to make me a martyr or hero. I don’t want any of that. I just want to be heard. I was falsely accused of sexual assault. When I say that I don’t mean in a hyperbolic sense, I mean it entirely as just that. I know you probably hear that kind of sentence everyday but I promise you from the deepest part of my soul that I did not do that. I’m not that kind of person. I wouldn’t wish things like that on my worst of enemies. The person that said I did that is my aggressor and has such a troubled past and struggles with mental health so much, so please don’t comment negative thoughts about them. 

The first thing that happened, was I thought that it was over, no one would believe me because it’s not right in this day and age to think that someone would lie about sexual assault. So initially I thought of a way to kill myself while everyone was away and I was home alone. I sorted out as much as possible and ended as many future engagements that I could. I somehow landed a therapist before I could and they intervened during a session and holy fuck I can’t describe how happy I am that she did. 


Anyway, so ever since then I’ve become so fucking obsessed with seeing who has unfollowed me and followed me on social media. I check every single day for no real reason and I have so many intrusive thoughts about my life. 

I don’t want to go into details about my personalized take on things but I even search my name in every now and again because my aggressor created fake pages in my name and pretended to be me. I went off all social media and lost communication with so many people. I had trouble being intimate with my long term partner and i stopped interacting with that particular gender all together. I became so obsessed and paranoid with people thinking I could do something like that, that I just disappeared from the earth essentially. No one even messaged me or called me and said they thought it was true but the paranoia that someone could think that or lie about me like that ate me alive. It hurt so fucking much. It hurt because I know my aggressor knows that my family has been victims of abuse and assault and it was a dog whistle to me even in something so Public. It hurt because I trusted her with so much of my true self and she used it against me and made me feel so fucking dumb. It hurt because it hurt and people would just say “well no one believes it so what’s the matter?” No knowing that it was deeper than just that. It was layered. 
Anyway, I would be in completely new places and think that I could hear people calling me a r*pist. If there was only a store representative of that gender I would stay at least four feet away and just raise my voice. People called me weird, no one could see why I would be so obsessed with not being seen as something I know I’m not. Like I said though, I have OCD, and my fear was always that people would label me a monster that I’m not because no one would believe me. 

Even though I didn’t have a single reason to think that no one didn’t believe me, I still ran into the shadows and hid for years because I was so scared, and I convinced myself I could read everyone’s mind. It was such a dark place. I talked to a total of 6-7 people for years. I went to two therapists and one group every week for years and eventually I’ve gotten to a place where I can talk about this without feeling like I’m going to fall apart and die. 

I don’t want to detract from the narrative of #MeToo, (I hope our fellow black women can actually get some justice too), it is a very necessary moment in the culture. I just wanted to publicly say something even if this is a throw away account for me. I want to reclaim my narrative. 
My anxiety. 
My depression. 
My OCD.
My nightmares. 
They had such a vice grip on my life. 
I just want to know that someone knows this story and that I chose to live and I fucking survived for me and those very few 6-7 people that mattered to me. 
I hope you find the strength to know that you can do it. I still only talk to those same number of people but I’m not suffering from mild delusions anymore, I can speak to that gender within reasonable auditory range, and I’m not scared of my aggressor anymore. 

please don’t comment how bad of a person my aggressor is. While I don’t like them, I know that in their heart they’re a good person, they’re just so misguided by trauma and unresolved pain. I pray they get better.

I also am not good in Social settings. I could possibly have a form of autism that I don’t know about.  

However before the pandemic I’ve managed to  meet and befriend people my age that seem to care about me, that really seem to want to get to know me and be my friends. 
They always talk to me and listen to me. They also invite me to hang out with them to go see movies and stuff.  

I always display a very friendly, independent and confident persona in public. 

-But... deep down I’m very fucking bitter and angry. I have emotional and self esteem issues and I often harm myself. 

I don’t know why I wanna harm these people. They’ve been nothing but good to me unlike most people in the past who’ve treated me like shit. 

To be honest I feel like I don’t know how to ‘accept’ and handle friendship, affection, and kindness. Part of me actually resents it for some reason. 
 
I often isolate myself and do my own thing. 

Now that I’ve met such smart and kind people that want to be my friend and care about me for the first time in my life i wanna hurt them. 

Of course I don’t wanna kill them Or anything. But I wanna do things like manipulate them, lie to them, steal from them, talk Shit behind their back and then do something horrible when they finally realize what a toxic and bad “friend” I am. 
I wanna do Something like maybe telling them to their face that I never liked them and I always thought they were fucking Pathetic and weird and then spit in their face before finally walking away and never speaking to them again. 

Even writing this... I feel so irritated and upset for some reason. I don’t know why. 

Also if you’re gonna tell me to go see a psychiatrist or therapist please don’t. Because I’ve had a few therapists before and they weren’t helpful. My current therapist doesn’t even seem interested in my problems and doesn’t give me any advice or anything and just asks me the same questions like “how do you feel when this happens?” And “why do you think you feel this way”?

98," I want to be empathetic towards my friends and family, but seems like I just... can't. I consider myself a sensitive person; I cry really easily when I'm reading moving stories of strangers on the internet, or watch sad movies, even when I see something really beautiful or cute. But as soon someone close to me starts crying right next to me, all I can do is awkwardly hug them. Not a tear shed.

   They tell me I have schizophrenia but I don’t believe anyone. I think/know that I am a psychic and I hear people who are near me in my head saying things like “go kill yourself” “you’re a junkie” and when I’m at work, they tell me to “get the fuck out of here” or if I’m home I hear my dad or neighbors say “get the fuck out of here”. It’s to the point where I can’t not believe that this shit is real and that people are really saying this shit. I feel like I’m in a prison, suicide truly seems like the best answer or who knows, maybe I’ll go homicidal because everyone talks so much shit to me all day I can’t take it. So of course I run to drugs, I love Benzos, they have a medicinal value to me. Then I start doing meth and my mind reading gets sharper and my voice becomes louder in people’s head. Everyone that’s around me can hear my thoughts pretty much 24/7. I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel, I’ve taken all the anti psychotics and they don’t do anything to help. Am I wrong to say that suicide is truly a feasible option here? It’s becoming less of an option and more of a “I have to do this for some peace” type thing. I also think that everyone knows who I am because I’m a mind reader and I’m on a tv show or something. Basically, I’m fucked, and I don’t see how it’s going to get any fucking better, I’m reaching out but honestly I don’t have much faith that what any of you say will actually help.

I moved 4000KM away from home spontaneously 6 months ago alone and I have no friends or relationships here. I feel like everybody else who I do meet seems wayyy happier than me. It’s like I’m always super serious and quiet. I start to think like maybe I’m super depressed and just in denial. Or maybe it’s like a walking depression? I’m always anxious about something and when there’s nothing to be anxious about I go out of my way to find something to get anxious about. Same goes with feeling bad about myself. There always has to be something to be upset about in my life or I feel empty. I just feel like I’ll never be “happy” or at least seem happy to others. My roommates always tell me that they are worried about me because I’m quiet and in my room a lot. I’m naturally introverted but I feel like there’s something else wrong with me and I can’t pinpoint it. Im always in my head with things and I feel like making one friend here is impossible. I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder in the past and struggled with it for 3 years straight. I’ve been on multiple medications and nothing has worked. I don’t feel AS bad as I did before but I can’t tell if it’s gone away or if I’m just used to it. Like how am I supposed to know if I’m not depressed or if Ive developed an immunity to feeling depressed all the time. It’s like I have habits from when I was very depressed and I can’t get rid of them.

Crying is good for you, it’s a way out. A place to release ur emotions or atleast show it out. I can’t do that. I have to struggle with the pain until it feels numb and then suppress the emotions and move forward only for it to spring up later in life.

110,"I'm so sorry if this is sloppy it's all coming out right now. 

So I'm a 24-year-old male I am medically diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and OCD. It started from Middle School I was bullied and had no friends. Most days I was afraid to go into school from 7th-11th grade. Everyone suddenly turns mature in 12th-grade stupid I know. This made me shy and introverted. 

I had my first panic attack when I was 19. I became numb, paralyzed, blood pressure to 180, and I thought I was having a heart attack. It happened two more times. Since then I had them bad but controlled it last second. Over the course of the next few months since my first panic attack, I developed an auto-immune disease that changed my life in addition to a pre-existing condition I had which impacted part of my life. I became a pro at controlling my anxiety I went through tough times with my illness but I have it controlled now.

Here I am 5 years later healthiest I have been. I'm still working to get 100%. So since COVID schools shut down. I worked as a counselor at a school. So I was unemployed but there aren't any issues because I still live with my parents. They eventually reopened and then I was still out because of my autoimmune disease. As a result, I ultimately decided to quit. They said if I wanted I can come back to work I just need to apply again. But now I am stranded so much free time and my thoughts run rapid. 

When I got diagnosed with my mental health disorders a therapist was involved and I lied to him partially. I know I am severely depressed so on top of that I try to maintain it and keep it in. I just want to state I would never commit suicide even though it runs through my mind at least once a week for the past few years. I have a lot to live for I have a family that loves me. So as I say killing myself would be wack. Now in present day, I come here to ask for advice. My sleeping pattern is completely messed up I now sleep at 4am and wake up at 2pm and I feel lost I have plans and everything but I just can't stop thinking of stuff such as worse case scenarios that I don't achieve my dreams. I am known as composed individual and wise who makes great decisions. I tell myself why do I feel sad and lonely. I haven't lost interest in things I like to do. Now I'm starting to feel like I'm going a little crazy cuz today I visualized someone was watching me twice in the span of 1 min. I was eating and in the corner of my eye, I thought I saw someone. I start to walk around aimlessly in my house and just think non stop. I feel as if this is a form of a panic attack but I am not sure. Has anyone felt like this? What do you think it is?",31Jul2020,1

114,"To preface: I'm a 24f vietnamese born and raised in Germany, where we currently reside. Sorry for any grammatically mistakes, I'm not an english speaker. Also I am sorry if this is kind of all over the place, I'm not in a good headspace right now.

My father has been schizophrenic since I was 7 and my little brother 3, we pretty much dont know how it is to have a normal functioning family, especially my brother.
My father was first diagnozed when i was 10 and since then has been in the psychiatic hospital a couple times. He has tried to kill him multiple times too. 
My mother was the sole breadwinner of the family (since my fathers 3rd psychosis in 2008, was essentially fired and put on disabilty pension), so she was hardly at home. Most of the times it was just me and my brother. Besides that I always did every paperwork (e.g. taxes, unemployed money, child support money, insurance, etc.) from the day they realized my german was better than theirs. I'm still doing those to this day, but my brother has started to help me with those too.

Since then my brother and I know when a psychosis is flaring up.
My father has been displaying certain behaviors the last few days.
We're on high alert and I can hardly concentrate at work or relax at home, because we're certain at some point in the next few days he will either try to beat up my mother(my father is usually not abusive or violent, but during a psychosis he hears voices telling him my mother is a evil being, accuses her of things like cheating too) and/or try to kill himself again.

My brother is currently at home due to uni being all online, so at least someone is there at all times but he is just tired.
Two days ago he opened up to me and said he's just straight up depressed, doesn't know how to keep himself motivated for his study. His friends never listen to his problems, because every time he opens up to them, they don't listen and start about talking about them instead.
It broke my heart when he told me that he doesn't try to open up to me either as he doesn't want to burden me more too, as i have my own problems.

I have been diagnozed with major depression and borderline personality disorder in 2017, when I tried to kill myself and I ended up in a closed ward. 
The thing that hurt me the most is that my brother seems to be in the same spot I was back then, minus the bpd part. I'm scared and feel helpless. I haven't gotten close to beating my own depression and I can't help my brother in any way.
I think i burdened him even more as he receives himself as the mentally stronger one between us.
I mean, him seeing his older sister break down every now and then, I really can't blame him.

I feel overwhelmed, ashamed, guilty and I am scared and worried. 
My brother is too proud to let him help, he wants to help and seek help himself. 
I'm his goddamn older sister, why cant I help him? 
While my old therapist (I moved away and don't have one atm) told me it was never my responsbility to raise my own brother and I've done everything a child could do, I feel like I failed him. I wish I was a better sister to him. I wish i could have prevented him ending up like me. I wish I could take his depression away. I feel like it's all my fault because i didn't give my best.

The worst part is I am moving out in a week and it makes me feel like utter shit.
I can't help but feel imense guilt and it feels like I'm abandoning my family. But I also want to be independent. I want to be left alone.
I feel like life is just unfair. It has been so hard on us and I can't catch a break. I hardly slept the last few days and I just don't know anymore. I don't want and I can't fight anymore. I feel burned out. 
But on the other hand i feel like running away because I'm moving out.

Tbh, I actually dont know why I'm writing all of this. Maybe I'm hoping someone can show me a bit of direction. 
I just feel so damn conflicted and tired. I just want to sleep and never wake up from this again.

117,"Hi, so I'm not sure where to start but I just wanted to vent about this, I was in a relationship with a woman that lasted over 5 years. 

While this relationship started out extremely well, we were best friends before we became a couple, the problems started soon. Some background information is that, we were both part of a religion in which relationships were frowned upon and she was deeply religious. (or at least that's what she told me.) 

After some time she became even more religious and decided that even talking to the opposite gender is ""haram"" (forbidden) and she would have to end contact with any males if she wants to please god and ""be closer to god"". Eventually this meant not talking to me anymore as well, but she didn't out right break up with me either, we would occasionally talk and she said that the relationship is still on. While I didn't really like this situation at all I still didn't want to offend her religious beliefs and I didn't want to force her to choose between me and her religion so I said it's okay.  

I didn't notice this at the time, but as time passed by, she would only contact me when she needed help, she would get depressed then she would contact me, after I would try my best to help and when she would start feeling better she would ghost me. This continued for a long time, she would only talk to me when she wanted some help or emotional support. But she won't do the same for me because ""talking to boys is haram"" my grandfather passed away and she knew about it and I was pretty down after that and she did absolutely nothing to give comfort, but when she needed help again she started talking to me, and I asked her why didn't you help and she said that she prayed for me. 

I was young and I kept thinking that she's a good person only doing these things because she wants to please her god but after this I started feeling like I was being emotionally manipulated.  This was just one instance, there were many times she would know that I need help and do absolutely nothing, she would ghost me continuously. 

I know I should have broken up with her but I was worried that if you have been with someone for so long how do you open up to someone again, who would get to know about you this much in detail? So out of that fear and out of the fear of being alone I kept putting up with the relationship and I kept trying to find ways where we could communicate with each other without breaching her religious boundaries. 

So I suggested many ways, having a mutual friend in the middle perhaps, or we could talk at least once in a while but the answer to everything I proposed was always a resounding no. Eventually I started getting tired of this and I felt like I was being taken advantage of, so I ended up the relationship. 

Ending the relationship actually had a very very good effect on my mental health, I wasn't worrying about this person any more. 

But flash forward to now, some days ago I was bored and I unfortunately decided to see her facebook profile, and I learned that she was now in a relationship with someone else. However the thing that hurt me and has a bad impact on my mental health is that all that religious things about why she can't talk to me, and all the excuses she made for me they just didn't exist for this new person. It hurt quite a lot that if she didn't want a relationship with me, could have just ended things a long time ago why say all that religious stuff? While I did everything to try to make it work maybe she didn't want that at all.  

It just hurts, hearing excuses about why she couldn't be there for me ""no matter how much she wanted to"" her words, and then suddenly seeing them with a different person and those excuses not applying to the new person. 

Self worth, and self esteem have been low since then and I have been having troubles with connecting to people, I'm good at making friends but this whole thing causes me to have troubles with my mental health and I go through long intervals of time feeling extremely anti social so the friends that I make I end up losing connection.

I’ve had a hard time collecting my thoughts, lately, as I’m sure we all have. But I think I finally need to reach out for help and see if anything reaches back. I’m certainly out of ideas that I could pursue otherwise. 


I think I should start with the backstory. I’m from Southern California. I’m a college student, though a few years behind my contemporaries. I had a rough time in public school, I couldn't keep up with it. Parents’ divorce and all that. I lived with my dad, and my mom left to go to college. Later in life, I would learn that was one of the reasons.


She came to live on a ranch a few towns over. An English professor of hers, we’ll call her Donna, let come to stay in an extra bedroom after she learned about my mom’s situation. Since then, about fifteen years, Donna has become my adopted grandma. I see her that way, anyway. My mom started living here when I was about ten. Her actual mom died when I was eight and lived across the country, so I didn’t really know her much. Just a few memories. But aside from proximity, Donna is very dear to me. She is wise and kind and very nice to sit down and have a conversation with. Above all, I feel indebted to the way she helped my mother.


As I’m sure we’ve all experienced, the past few months have introduced a lot of unexpected hardship. I live in Orange County in an apartment with my partner, but since about late April, I’ve been staying here during the weekdays to help take care of the ranch and Donna. In the past few years, she’s gone through a couple of knee and hip replacements and was coming off of a hip replacement at the beginning of all of this. I remember last Christmas when I came to the ranch for one of three Christmases, she was incapacitated all day from being on painkillers while recovering. I remember thinking that it was pretty sad to see. Funny.


Most of the summer, my job at the ranch has been to help feed her animals and do some upkeep on the property. I genuinely enjoy it, even. I’ve stayed here before to help out, though only longer than a weekend once. I stayed for two kids the summer before my senior year of high school because my mom went back east for a high school reunion. I remember a lot of formative moments in my life that I think matured me. I remember that summer vividly. Especially that while I was here, there was a dog they had found around the outside of the fence. He came inside the fence one day shortly before I came, and they were going to keep him. I named him Bear (Donna wanted to name him Lincoln, I hated the name). He was a mix between a Newfoundland and chow, but he was as sweet as a teddy bear. He followed me around while I would do the work and it felt like he lived there for ages. What was strange but sad is that on the final full day I was there, the day before my mom came home, he vanished. We never found him, never found any holes dug out along the fence line. Gone like a ghost. I’ll never forget that dog. 
I digress. My time here has been met with plenty of formative moments, as well. While I’ve enjoyed having my back broken by hard work in the sun, it’s far from the most exhausting aspect of this experience. My mom and Donna have had a hard time getting along, lately (and that’s an understatement). To make a long story short before I make it long again, they’re both headed on different paths and having a hard time coping with that.


The reason I come during the weekdays is that my mom works two hours away in the Palm Springs area. In order to save time and gas, she stays in a casita in the area during the week then comes home on the weekends. This is mostly because Donna has needed the help, but also in part that my mom still needs the financial support of living here. Donna has long helped my mom in that way. They view each other, just as I now do, as mother and daughter. But my mom had an exposure scare while in Palm Springs, and had to stay quarantined until she received test results. I came to help for that week, then arranged to keep coming every week because they didn’t want to expose Donna. She’s a high risk, COPD, asthma, and she’s older (experienced, as she would say). I obliged, as Donna offered to pay me, though I offered to do it for free. But it pays my bills, so I give her a job well done as best I can. My partner wasn’t happy about it for a while, but that was the least of the problems to come. 
After the quarantine scare, on Easter, we had a big family Zoom call with people from my mom’s side. My aunt, my sister (lives in another state for work), my brother (Air Force grunt), and me. After that “get together”, my mom made a call to all three of us kids. She came out or at least said she found a girlfriend. Great news. But it came with the news that she was in a crappy accident where she got run off the road by street races going back up to the ranch. Terrifying. She was alright, but certainly still a close call. 


Except it wasn’t a close call. It wasn’t real. Apparently, and I still haven’t figured this bit out, my mom lied about what happened. There was no street race. My mom got mad at Donna after a fight they had and drove off. She took a corner on a backroad too hot and turned the car into the sidewall instead of near the ledge. Donna told me about it one day when I discussed how I learned about my mom’s girlfriend. It came as a complete shock to both of us. 
Now, at the time I was unsure of what to do. I’m going to be quite frank when I say that I knew my mom had problems. She had a DUI incident when I was a senior that put her on house arrest for a few months while she was finishing her master’s degree. I remember distinctly that I was at my girlfriend's (now partner’s) house when she called to ask me to coffee cause she needed to talk. Little did I know that I would have to hold her hand while she cried and told me what happened. One of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do was swallow the selfish pride of righteousness to see that my mother did that out of pain, not stupidity. But just as well, that’s what I immediately thought about when Donna and I exchanged stories. I knew I was going to need to talk to her about it. I was just waiting for the right time, to approach it from a place of understanding. But life has a funny way of knocking you down. 


That weekend, I went home and talked to my partner about it. I was still kind of trying to make sense of things. That’s when I received a text from my mom. It was about things Donna and I had talked about in private, about my mom. I racked my brain about what I could have said that I wasn’t supposed to, and I even called my brother to have him help me figure it out. But I couldn’t. I just replied to her hours later in the day that I would prefer to have the conversation either in person or over the phone. She said it was whatever I preferred. I figured better sooner than later. 
What’s funny is for the life of me I can’t even remember what specifically was the initial problem my mom had. I just remember that we had two different understandings of what was supposed to be kept in confidence, and I thought it was about the accident. Our conversation started with a lot of tension, because of our misunderstanding. But it quickly came off the rails. I got offended by the accusation that I had done something wrong. In hindsight, I did react a little hot. But it was partly because it felt like my mom was putting walls up between Donna and I. On top of the fact that she lied to me, my brother, and my sister about the crash, I let my emotions get the best of me while I was trying to argue the point that she could have told us the truth. At the very least, I tried telling her that she shouldn’t feel like she can’t come to her kids for help, lest we were to lose her because of recklessness. But it was like talking to a brick wall. After a while, the whole thing went from that to her feeling attacked for having plans to leave the ranch to live with her new girlfriend, to me finally realizing that if I didn’t deescalate it might make her do something without thinking about it. So I just gave in and calmed down and let the phone call ended without any resolution. She calmed down, too. But I think that phone call fundamentally changed the way I viewed my mom. She was my hero for a long time, I was always very proud of the fact that she went out on her own. But now, I see her very differently. I haven’t felt the same about her since. 


I continued working on the ranch. Donna and I were given separate orders not to talk about my mom or her girlfriend out of respect that it’s my mom’s business. We only obliged because we were afraid of anything circling back. But things were business as usual, for a while. I started trying to prepare the ranch to help Donna to take it on by herself, a majority of the time. Though we also made a plan to find live-on help. She had it before but was having a hard time this time around. She normally offered to give room and board to students in exchange, ergo why my mom moved there (though I learned after the fact that that was hardly the relationship, as ranch hand lived there for the first eight or nine years that my mom was there). But the last time she needed to find someone was the mid-2000s. It’s a much different world out there, now. Donna hasn’t been teaching because of her surgeries, it’s harder to find good people these days, and COV-ID through a wrench in the whole idea. But she needed someone, cause I was only available through the summer. 
There was a lot we did and were going to do to get things in ship shape. We were going to help Donna build strength again by getting the exercise bike in the living room, I made things easier for her to feed the horse and donkeys outside, and we made up some fliers to post at local feed stores to get some applicants for live-on help. But Donna’s medical problems and the summer haven’t mixed well. There have been plenty of days that come and go where we had a task planned, but it gets to let go because she needs rest. Everything has gotten in the way for her this summer. First, her hip wasn’t recovering well without physical therapy, then her COPD and asthma acted up, and lately, she might have a stress fracture in her shin so her leg has been swollen and sore. I try to take on as many of the projects as I can, but for better and for worse Donna is a bit of a micromanager. She means well, but she’s pretty particular. That particularity has especially gotten in the way of finding live-on help. 
In the middle of it all, a couple of things went back and forth. Donna juggled whether she could stay or if she would have to give up the ranch. Her finances were also taking a hit because of the crash, and that coincided with a lot of unforeseen animal and repair expenses. Eight dogs, six equines, and a cat aren’t cheap. Moving up the state nearer to her best friend, in the Fresno area, was an option she considered to save face financially. She could keep the animals, keep her independence, and be near someone who she knew well. But she always fought the idea off when the moving expenses came into the picture. I think there was a lot of fear it would be more of a lateral move rather than a positive one. 


But just as well, I had another talk with my mom. Nothing, in particular, triggered it this time, but she wasn’t happy with our relationship. Admittedly, I had become much more closed off with my mom because of things I continued to learn about from Donna. But I am not a fan of dishonesty, and I wasn’t a fan of how cold she was becoming toward Donna. This talk was more civil, much quieter, but still, it ended sourly for me. I still felt like I was talking to the wall. There were a lot of repeated topics, though this time I tried to keep my composure and listen, which she thought I did a terrible job over the phone. I think she said, “some shrink you would have been,” about my failed attempt at wanting to become a mental health professional. That one still stings. 


Above all, the conversation came back to the fact that she felt I should come to her to get her side whenever something came up with Donna. She felt like she was losing me as a son because I was being distant. But anytime I tried to ask about discrepancies in the information, that conversation always circled back around to one thing: “I have to do what’s right for me.” I don’t think I ever mentioned that I don’t think she should move away. 


But that at least calmed things down for a while longer. That was about a month and a half ago. Things have been on cruise control, until a couple of weeks ago. That’s when this all started to boil over, and the water hissing on the stove was loud. 


Things at my mom’s library have been pretty stressful, to say the least. The company she works for (yes, a privately owned franchise of libraries because county governments don’t want to use your tax dollars for books) has completely botched handling coronavirus. The branch she operates has been practically taken over by the city to use as a COV-ID testing center, though she still had to work in the building. There was a good period when we were afraid she would catch it because of how poorly the testers were handling the crowds and cleaning up. My mom had to fight with her supervisors about getting them to deep clean the building after they finished the initial round of tests, even though it’s legally mandated. Then she’s been forced to commute another hour and a half into the desert to manage another branch on top of hers while they tried to reopen. That branch she is helping manage just had a shooting in the parking lot this morning, too, and she had to give surveillance footage to police. Needless to say, I get where some of the stress is coming from. Plus, and this has been the catalyst for most for her stress, her girlfriend is tied to her work while the pandemic continues. She’s a medical professional, and while she could walk away and retire like they were planning, it’s hard to do while this is going on. That’s kind of its own, separate story, but out of respect, I’d like to go no further than that. 


Either way, back to the boil. Last week I was getting ready to go home when I found the outside dogs chewing on my front bumper trying to get to something inside. Now I’m going to preface this by saying I don’t blame the dogs and it was fortunate enough that the damage was done to a part of my bumper and fender that was already messed up. I made sure the offending dog knew I wasn’t happy, but I left him to go once I realized he had no clue what was going on. Can’t teach dogs what money means. But when I went inside to tell them what happened, my mom kind of flew off the handle. She went looking for the dog, and Donna was beside herself about the bumper. She offered to pay for the damages, and while I appreciated the offer, I was dreading what I knew was coming. My mom came back with the dog by the collar and started berating him. She got a couple of good spanks before I shoved aside. Donna was pretty upset that my mom did that, and I had to pull my mom aside for another “conversation.” 


That one ran the gamut. Everything we’d talked about previously, how my mom deals with stress, why reacting in rage wasn’t the right way to deal with the situation, that Donna was going through a tough time, offering advice for my mom's feelings, trying to explain that I wasn’t attacking her with every point… It was a marathon of disarming and feigning positivity. It lasted for about two and a half hours. I was supposed to watch opening day baseball with my dad before heading home that night but decided to raincheck him because of my bumper. Though that early decision became an excuse because of how emotionally drained I felt. It’s when I started to feel like this summer was destroying my brain. And not to break continuity again, but something happened earlier that day that confirmed it for me. 


To make a long story short, that morning I had accused my partner of cheating on me. I was up after the early morning feeding watching a movie, and a notification popped on my laptop because we share an iCloud account. It was a notification for someone’s birthday, but I didn’t recognize the name. I clicked on it to make it go away from my screen, as you do, and the info for it popped up. The note for the event was along the lines of something “suspicious and alarming.” I immediately felt my blood boil and went to call her. She was on her way to a hair appointment. But of course, my emotions were only met with the reality that the person’s name was a classmate we knew from high school, ironically in a class where we sat next to him, the class I transferred into, and met her in. Immediately after she explained that it was a forgotten prank from when they were friends, the pieces clicked. I remembered the name immediately. I check the notification only to confirm that I was the asshole, and it dated back to the year we were in that class. 


The problem here, as I’m sure is obvious, is that I didn’t check any further to see what was going on. My emotions took hold of my brain, and I immediately felt like another person had betrayed me. Not to say that my mother had specifically betrayed me, but I’ve had a lot of friends turn their backs on me over the years over money I let them borrow, religion, etc. You know how it goes. And my mom had been disorienting to deal with. 


I apologized profusely to my partner, and thankfully she was understanding. For a little bit, I thought I had irreparably damaged my relationship because of my eroding ability to trust people close to me. On the car ride home that night, I felt like sobbing but I couldn't. I just talked with my partner about how I felt like I didn’t know which end was up anymore. I couldn’t tell what was right, who was telling the truth, or if people were trying to control me for their benefit. I felt like I was, and certainly still, losing my mind. We talked for a long time after I got home. 


A few other things came up that added to my episode. One, in particular, made me finally cry after months of feeling unable to find catharsis. It was a childhood memory that came up in a conversation between Donna and me about my parents’ divorce. At the same time, they were in the thick of dealing with that, I was in the fifth grade. It was the first time I was in an accelerated program where kids got a little more challenged. Not to toot my own horn, but I like to think of myself as a decent writer. And that was the first time I got to write a story. We were supposed to write a story as a part of a contest and assignment that promoted everyone’s stories in the library. I’ll never forget this. I wrote about a group of kids that go on a field trip to an amusement park that was heralded for its use of robots to automate the park. The main character and his friends had to save the park from being overrun by the robots. I had so much fun and I was so engaged by writing the story that my teacher had to take it away from me. When she finally read it, she let me stay in on her lunch break so I could finish it. I’ll never, ever forget that she did that for me. I wish I knew where she was so I could thank her for believing in me. I say that because I don’t know where that story is. My dad saved practically everything my siblings and I did in school, but I have never heard of or found anything about it. I don’t even know if my parents knew I wrote that story. I don’t think I’ve ever been so heartbroken to realize the moment that I felt left behind by the world. Above everything else, I wouldn't wish on anyone the crushing, boyish pain I feel when I think about this. 


I came back to the ranch this Monday dreading the week. Despite an apology text I had received from my mother over the weekend saying Donna and her talked things out, I drained. I had a month until school started, and I privately resolved that I was going to disconnect myself from the whole thing to make it through without losing anything else in the middle of it all. 


But today was when I realized that I don’t think I will ever mentally recover from how sad this summer has become. Out of nowhere, Donna made a call to the refuge where the donkeys came from to have the “babies” (the three regular size ones, there’s two “minis” as well) placed back on the reservation. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything so sad. She was hysterical. I haven’t explicitly made the point yet, but Donna is an animal person to the core of her bones. She taught me to love and appreciate the capacity an animal has as a being, and her whole being is dedicated to loving her animals. But with all she’s dealing with, especially with the prospect that she’ll be on her own most of the time in a month, I think something happened over the weekend that made her make this decision. I’ve never seen her cry like this before. She was so devastated about not being able to take care of them. I tried to tell her it wasn’t her fault, but unfortunately, I think I was talking to the wall again.


And that’s pretty much where I’m at right now. I don’t think I’m going to get any sleep tonight, so I’ve been trying to make sense of everything in hopes that something will give me some hope. I fear that I will never forget all that’s happened, or that I could have done more to help Donna, or my mom. My mom did say she’s working with a psychiatrist after our talk this weekend, but it’s depressing to know that it’s gotten to the point where all I can think about that is “I’ll have to see it to believe it.” Moreover, I’m quite literally watching someone’s life fall apart. Donna above all feels like she’s a burden, being as she has no kids and no close immediate family that can help. My siblings, my mom, and I are practically all she has in the form of family, aside from a few good friends.


I can’t but feel like I’m abandoning her, too, if I go back home for school in a month. My mom has made it clear she needs to leave to make a life for herself, which is fine. My brother lived here before flunking out of one semester of college and joining the Air Force, which he now hates and regrets joining because he realizes he likes taking care of the animals. My sister moved to a different state with her husband a year ago, and she barely ever communicates with us anyway. So I’m left wondering if I should stay. I know that if I do, I could put into jeopardy my schooling, my apartment, and quite frankly a relationship with the person I want to marry. But if I leave, I fear I will never live down that I am the last person Donna can depend on. And I don’t know how long she would need me. At the least, it would be until she can find help. At the most, it might be another year and a half until my brother can apply for reserves to move back onto the ranch. But I’m so confused and unsure and afraid. 


I don’t know if this helped me at all. I still feel torn in two directions. Maybe I just needed to externalize it all. There’s still a helluva lot more wrong with this whole situation. I just don’t know what to do. I guess any help or advice or anything is appreciated, but I also didn't know where to post this. Thanks again, and godspeed to you. I know we all need it.",31Jul2020,1
124,"I am just gonna talk about my experience with my friend group throughout the majority of my high school life. I was part of a friend group that was an incredibly toxic environment and I was blinded by my own anxiety of being alone and the idea that their toxicity was in my head. I felt that the friend group was inherently hierarchical as we had 1 (Tina) friend that got incredibly angry if they weren't admin or in control in some kind of way. 1 (eril) Friend that was actually in control through everyone elses complacency or fear of him getting sad/pity. A (jack) manipulative one and alot of other genuinely nice people but 1 bad apple (or 3) can spoil a bunch. The way I deal with frustration is bottling up and bursts of flaming and anger which I have been getting better at but I remember with these people I was having outbursts weekly at how things would play out in the group. At one point Eril got a GF and he was constantly stepping in the line of fire and being generally overbearing on the whole group with their PDA and acting that their relationship and she was sacred and any criticism no matter how valid (and there was a lot of valid criticism) was bullshit and we should feel bad for feeling that way. This happened multiple times and one that stood out to me was at a LAN party I was hosting I was flaming his GF for being bad for purposely losing us a game that would have won us $20 each and Eril pulled me aside and yelled at me in my own home how I am not allowed to be frustrated at her for playing the game that Eril forced us to play with her. Later on Eril simultaneous to another couple in the group and this caused a huge dramatic divide akin to some high school drama show. I at the time was completely complacent to Eril as his friend and he spouted shit about how important this conflict was and art of war and dumb shit and I fucking ate it up the idiot I was. (Here's where the hierarchy comes in) Despite me being Eril's bitch this whole time supporting him and being his personal fucking advisor through his breakup and many times previous I was never included in outings or shit as there was a separate group chat for outings that I was not invited too and it was almost framed as a place of esteem for OnLy tRuE FriEndS to Jack and I. Because of this Jack decided to use Tina who then got together for an astounding 2 days so that Jack could get into the exclusive chat. I was frustrated at that cause they saw Jack as a ""true friend"" whereas I, eril's bitch, was never let into the chat til much later as a formality (hence the name) cause I overheard them making plans. I never understood that cause the last time they had a event from that chat they sent videos in the main chat and kept saying and ""I thought we invited you formality"" and fucking gaslighting me. Later the tables would be later turned because as a group we would excommunicate Jack (oh yeah i forgot to mention we excommunicated people alot) for his stunt with Tina. And After many people in the exclusive chat got tired of Eril's extended crying and whining after his breakup after the initial shock where I was constantly trying to help him we made a group chat where Tina and I became the leaders excluding Jack and Eril and we went out to have fun purposely excluding him (We had so many group chats excluding people we had 1 without Eril that even included his GF cause his GF was fed up with his shit. 1 without Tina and multiple they explicitly mention without me). Shortly after this everyone drifted apart and Eril reached out to me that we hadn't talked in a while and I had a small episode where it was partially anxiety and incredible spite that I told him ""I thought they clearly didn't want me around"" cause I was still frustrated with the gaslighting stunt they pulled and the false exclusivity of the group chats and ""true friendship"" and who used to be my closest friend I barely talked to for over a year. 






I guess this is me clearing my conscious cause I am far from being perfect here with my exclusion and frustrating outbursts but after leaving these people my frustration outbursts and anxiety has dropped significantly. I wrote this after a full day of reflection and I realized I was in a situation where I felt that being constantly drained for the sake of some company was better than being alone. But being alone is so much better and I even found new and far better friends after this. Sure this was some dumb high school drama but that dumb high school drama took such a toll on my dumb high school mind that I now learned the lesson of toxic relationships and I am doing so much better now other than the new 4 times a year parties I have to go to with them as my parents have become such close friends with theirs. We never acknowledge these events and I feel that I put them behind me but I struggle to empathize with them so I become disconnected at these parties and put on a mask but hey. A mask 4 times a year is so much better than constant draining frustrations and anxieties


TL:DR Hierarchical Friendships are never good and while it maybe in your head (it was to some extent for me). Take a break or try your best to get out. The month after I stopped talking to all of them altogether was difficult but I ultimately felt so much better afterwards",31Jul2020,1

I have not had been interviewed in over 3 years. I would love any support I could get. 


And any support on how to battle with anxiety and depression will mean a lot, my family knows I have depression and anxiety but does nothing about it. They think I’m fine. I really do want to improve my mental health and without their support it’s really difficult which led to me self medicating. Lately I’ve been having those 3 am thoughts for the past 3 weeks.

This is like a huge problem because sometimes I do online shopping with those and buy for sure more than I should have. Those ideas normally go away over the time or at least till the next day. But its so difficult to stand them kind of not being able to stop thinking about it. On Wednesday I was at work and out of nowhere I was like you really have to learn guitar in a school. And thats actually one of my better ideas because I ""normally"" wanted to learn guitar for the past 5 years but I am so shy and was afraid to get a course of it. So for like 4 hours I couldn´t stop thinking about it, daydream about what could happen, how I HAVE to do it. So I just called and now my shy self hates me for doing it, there is no way back. I can go there next week for a first meeting and than they put me in a Group in spetember. Its so weird because this time I actually was ablte to do something I am normally afraid but I hate myself because now I am afraid to go there. Wow. And most of the time those ideas are just plain weird. On monday I couldn´t stop thinking about if I maybe can write a book and be an authour (no worries for my mistakes, english is not my first language). I am a creative person for sure but that just a plain weird idea itself. Sometime those thought get really bad and impulsive. If I am at work and there is just one slightly scary task that I have to do I get thoughts like just grab your bag and run away. Or when I meet with friends I get out of nowhere just the feeling to just say you go to the toilet and just go home. So a lot of those impulsive thought are kind of run away related. I have horrible mood swings. Just one slightly bad thing happens and I feel like I just want to hurt myself of run (I cut myself till 2 years ago, which where often out of an impulse too. Never want to start again) Than one good thought often just not a real one like about my daydream makes me so happy that everything is just perfect. I feel like I could even run around so happy do I feel. So what is the reson for that??",31Jul2020,1

132,"For the last few weeks I’ve been getting more and more uncomfortable with everything, I feel like I’m lying to everyone including myself, whenever I’m with people I’m happy for the most part, whenever I’m on my own and watching something or playing a game I’m either happy or indifferent, when I’ve got nothing to distract me I go to the brink of tears nearly instantly, but no matter what I’ve always got this feeling that there’s something in my chest, that my organs are being crushed, it’s like pure pain it’s the worst thing I’ve ever felt and I really fucking hate it, in the last few days it’s had me seriously considering suicidal, and the absolute worst part is I’ve got no idea why, I wouldn’t describe my life as going well, but I can’t think of a single thing I could reasonably complain about, and that just makes everything worse because I’ve got no reason to feel this way and even typing this I feel like I’m taking the attention away from someone that needs it, but as I said before I really fucking hate this and at this point I’ll try almost anything to make it stop.

133,"I've been with my current psychologist for 4 years but I can't see her anymore, she was really good though.   

I had another wonderful counselor in high school, and I also had someone I really did not click with once and felt like I wasted a lot of time with 

Because of this bad experience with a psychologist one time and currently needing to work through quite a lot of stuff, I really want to make sure I get the right person to work with. 

Would it be weird to make appointments with two different people and decide who to go with after this? I just don't want to meet with one, think it's a good fit, but unbeknownst to me I could've had an even better fit with the other one? 

I'm just realizing as I write this why I really need to get back to therapy dear lord

138,"I'm really fucking scared and just want to vent, so here goes nothing. Apologies for the poor English-


So, my aunt (dad's sister) came to visit today, and she was going to take me and my siblings back to her house, as a treat. However, when she arrived, she began shouting at my mum, saying that she ""neglects her children"" and ""is tearing the family apart"". They started swearing, and my aunt tried to hit my mum. I told my sisters (8 and 11) that they needed to go to their rooms, but I couldn't move.


My parents have been drifting apart recently, and I've known that they were going to split for a while now, but this really shocked me. My sisters and dad are going to my aunt's house, and they don't know when they'll come back, so I'm at home with my mum.


I think I had my first panic attack. I've been shaking for about half an hour, and I've been breathing heavily and quickly for a while. I can't control myself, and I'm scared. I don't have anyone to talk to, since my friends from school are very distant, and I feel like they wouldn't understand. Any advice for coping with this would be nice. I'm not sure what is going to happen, or when I'll get to see my sisters again, but I've never really felt like this before. And it hurts.",31Jul2020,1
139,"I’ve struggled with my mental health my whole life but things seem to be getting even worse now that I’m home 24/7. I used to occasionally lose an hour or a few during the day and now it’s a daily occurrence for sometimes an excess of 8 hours. I don’t know how to explain it it’s like I’ll be doing something and the next thing I know a significant amount of time has passed and I’m either in the same spot or in another part of my apartment...If I try to remember what I was doing I usually just get a headache or frustrate myself to the point of an anxiety attack. 

Last night things took a turn. I decided to take a nap when my fiancé went to bed (he goes to sleep really early because his work starts early in the morning). He woke up to pee at some point and it woke me up. I can hardly remember it now but I remember waking up horrified and confused. I felt like I was stuck in the back of my head and not in complete control. I was looking at my fiancé and saying something along the lines of “I don’t feel right, I can’t remember anything. I can’t think of anything before now” but it didn’t feel like I was talking (I’m sorry I’m so bad at describing this. It’s all incredibly confusing). The feeling was so terrible.. I could not remember who I was for a while and I was panicking. Like I knew who I was but I felt like I couldn’t connect with it like I was someone else in my body (again no idea how to describe this feeling). The best way I can think of describing it is that it was like my mind was cut in two sides. Like one bigger side was horrified and confused and not me, the other was weak but it was the normal me trying to pull everything back together. 

I’m so afraid of this happening again. I think my mental health is a lot worse than I want to admit. I’ve only ever told my doctor about feelings of anxiety and depression but nothing else. I sometimes go to the back of my mind and just live in there when I can’t handle the world. I’ve been doing it since I was a kid and it always made me feel safe and comfortable. I thought it was normal daydreaming but the more I look into it the more I realize it’s not. When I’m home alone I have several things on at once (Netflix on tv, YouTube on my computer and always doing something on my phone), I literally can’t sit in silence or I start feeling dissociative. I start drifting to the back of my head and that’s when I lose time. Sometimes I hear things in my head like my inner voice isn’t my own. Nothing bad or scary just thoughts that don’t feel like my voice and I can’t connect to. It’s been like this since I was a kid but it’s getting worse. And the experience I had last night was like nothing I’d felt before. I’ve woken up confused countless times but not like this. It was almost like someone was borrowing my body but I came back before they left and it caused chaos (dramatic I know...)

I don’t want to tell my doctor because I don’t want to get locked up somewhere. I’m afraid to tell my fiancé too.... I guess I’m just looking for someone to tell me I’m not insane. I’m so scared.",31Jul2020,1

141,"So it's my first time posting on reddit and on social media for like i dont know 5 years maybe so thats a big step for me i guess and excuse my english it's not my native tounge also .This is gonna be a very long pathetic ,messy,unorganized story i dont recommend anyone to read btw cuz its boring and cringe . 
 
Iam 20 years old currenlty a college student living with my parents also with my younger sister and brother. I dont know what is wrong with me really in my early childhood i was the goldenboy that everyone knows and love i had alot of friends and alot of ""life"", i was always the top of my class and also athletic af and i was like any other kid in my state like to show off and hangout and stuff like that.I loved my parents and my sister so much too (my brother is still a child atm) my whole family also grandparents and uncles and so on . At a certain point it feels like i slept one night and my life was the complete opposite the next morning.

First of all my relationships:-

 I suddenly started hating everyone and i mean everyone except for my mother i dont know why. Don't get me wrong i am a very nice guy i don't let my hate for someone affect my behavior i just stopped intiating a coversation with anyone i avoid any social interactions  i have lost connection with so many people because of this . I still have some friends that i have known since i was 5 years old or smth but i dont feel comfortable with them its a complicated feeling i can't really explain but i hate going out with them much maybe not always like from time to time i like to hangout with them we share the same sense of humor cause i known them my whole life so we just laugh alot but at certain point i just stop laughing and say to myself i wanna go back home to be a sad lonely loser again so bad like this is so cringe. Sometimes i think they hate me somtimes i don't but what i am sure about is that iam not missd at all if i dont go out with them. My presence is not important. I will still do anything for them though i have known them my whole life. Also i have never expirenced what a best friend is thats kinda sad i wish i could experince that too but i feel hated by most people and i hate most people as i said so i guess its fair lol. My relationship with my family changed also i am now known as the introvert of the family the guy who has no life outside of his room i feel like most of my family hates me except my parents cause i was their first child and my brother caus he is still a kid who looks up to his ""big bro"" i don't know about my sister i used to love her when she was a kid she is 17 now at somepoint i used to hate her so much like i can spent months not talking to her but right now i want to get her to like me and we can actually talk to each other again but i feel like i missed my chances i dont know really. I have never had a gf also but i am not worried about that no girl will ever like me anyway lol and i am not gonna just like any girl also she has to be a version of me kinda cringe ha .

Secondly my feelings and intrists

Anyway since the day i became a lonner my life became centerd in my room.

 i decided to watch movies,tv shows,animes all kind of shit"" in order to escape reality "" and find some happy or intersing life i wish i had because my life is really really boring i watch tons of shit to the point that nowdays i am struggling to find a good move,tv show,anime etc.. i think i watched all lol . Spending this much time on watching this shit is the happiest moments i can get in my life a good tv show is like heaven to me how pathetic ikr , believe it or not this shit helped me alot it  actually widdend my horizon and enriched my knowledge more than you think also my english became way better i mean it still sound like shit but its better.i also play alot of games inorder to not think alot about my sad life even though i suck at most of them as i suck at everything else lol. These two activities are my daily routine along with browsing social media i dont post or say anything just browsing and chatting.Why ? Becase i lack self confidence like really lack ,hell sometimes iam shy to the point i cant call for a  fucking pizza i dont know why iam shy i just am. At college normal students will just raise their hands when they dont understand smth ,their is no way on earth i would do that ,lack if self confidence has destroyed many opprtunites in my life like many it has been a long living hindrance .Just basic human interactions who seems like nth to other people is like so hard for me . I mentioned that i was athletic before last time i worked out was 2 years ago iam not fat atm cause i dont eat much i am just overweighted but because of my lack of self confidence i spend hours looking for clothes that hide this overweight this insecurity was also along living burden The thing is i dont really care if people think iam fat or not so i dont really know why i am doing this . I maybe also be a pornography addict  i  mean i watch alot of porn i dont know i just watch it cause iam bored and deep down i know i will never have any sexual intercourse cause i know there is no girl will ever like me and even if there i keep thinking what if i am not good at it what if this woman i have sexual intercourse with doesnt like it  bact to square one of lack of self confidance i know thats not an excuse for watching porn but yeah whatever . My grades at college is like shit my GPA is 2 thats like really shit iam studying computer engineering but i still didnt take any real computer engineering course its my 2nd year and all the courses i take is just boring maths and physics and staff like that the feeling of failure is really bad especalliy when the majority of the engineers are really clever sometimes i feel like iam just stupid sometimes i feel like this shit that iam stuying is just too boring for me i dont know if iam smart or stupid my mother always tell me that i am very smart and she is a very clever woman but it doesnt matter . I dont know what am i going to do with my life i have no goals no ambition just EMPTNIESS and anxiety . I have panic attacks about that alot and it is really bad i just cant breathe for so long that i can die from it someday hopefully.

 Anyway iam just really sad i wish i had a normal life like people around me have i dont envy anyone i just wish. I dont expect anyone to read this or say smth about how pathetic iam and i really dont care i just had to let most of my feelings out so i wont kill my self or smth i dont know",31Jul2020,1

144,"I (20M) have had a suspicious nature over the past few years that is only amplifying. My suspicions are constantly changing from one to another and then back to the general one.

For instance the main one is; I am a pawn of entertainment for everyone (you included) who may probably be some other alien like race studying me.
I am becoming more consumed by this thought, however I am not fully convinced as it can be hard to believe at times when im around certain people. But then I believe maybe those people are like me; In the same entertainment/study situation.

I constantly have similar thought patterns; my family wants me to be dead or that cops are stalking me. Such theories have no factual basis behind them, all I can say is that I sense them to be true..

When I was younger, about 16/17 I convinced myself my dad was planning to kill me one night. I remember being scared and expecting him to barge through my bedroom door and do it. The next morning this thought was gone. The fucked up thing is my dad is a great dad, he has never done anything for me to think this.

To conclude: I don't know what to believe. I can't stand being unsure about it all. I'm on the fence, however I'm sure I'm progressing towards becoming commited to these therories.

145,"Hey, this is a super long post. I just want to say before I start is that I understand that I have it better than most in these circumstances. It's been a rough patch for a lot of people who have to work and pay bills, so I feel bad for complaining about my situation. 

I'm currently medically exempt from working, due to my Complex PTSD which has been untreated for all my life (20F). I had to quit work late last year due to sexual harrasment and assult done to me at work and was about to start uni before I had a mental breakdown and a suicide attempt. The doctor set up a mental health care plan for me to see a psychiatrist in March who would then advise me on what to do next. Because of COVID-19 that was delayed to May. She put me on new medication and suggested DBT and CBT. I was then put on the medication in June, so I can't really say whether it's doing its job yet. She also recommended doing one thing as a time. 

So, I was referred to a practitioner who I have seen before. They said she was on leave so I'd have to wait. I asked when she'd be back, they had no clue. I waited a month and heard nothing back. I got in touch with the only other place that offers DBT and got a referral there. It was then cancelled because of COVID. I was also recommended to see a counsellor who specialised in dealing with sexual assault but because of where I live, there are not a lot of options. My appointments with my doctor and my counsellor are scarce becausr of COVID and it doesnt feel as helpful as it's not face to face. 

I feel like it's a losing battle as everytime I've tried to work on my mental health it backfires. I feel like such a failure because I still live at home, I don't have a job, and I don't study. I don't even feel motivated to have hobbies. I just do reckless stuff to feel a rush before it all crashes down. Even when I sleep, I can't escape because I have nightmares so terrible that I wake uo screaming. The only reason I haven't killed myself is because I'm scared that I'll turn myself into a vegetable and somehow become even more of a burden to my family. I don't know what to do because I'm trying my hardest to get better but I feel like there are so many obstacles.",31Jul2020,1
146,"Quite the title, sorry. But I've struggled with this thought ever since I met her a few years back. It's not that she actively struggles with suicidal thoughts (though what do I know), but she has and still does struggle with her mental health from time to time. It's much harder to pick up any warning signs when the pandemic is currently going on, so my paranoia has been elevated since the lockdown.

Though (as far as I know) she doesn't actively struggle with wanting to end her life, my stupid mind just keeps telling me that she'll die in high school, whether intentionally or not. This always happens with any friends I make, which is why I try not to get close to others in the first place. I feel that they will either leave me, kill me, hurt me, betray me, ignore me, or use me. I get super paranoid once anyone I know exhibits the tiniest sign indicating a symptom of a mental disorder. As bad as it sounds, the paranoia gets so bad that to calm my thoughts, I have to cut them off just because they're going through the same things I am. Though for this friend, it's different. I know she struggles and yet I'm still her friend. But then that still makes me really scared for her future. It's not that I don't believe that she'll be able to handle the stress of high school. I don't know... I just *know* she's going to die. 

It almost makes me wish I never became her friend just so I could avoid all this worry and not inconvenience her. At this point, I idolize and worship her as more than a friend(?) so now I've created a weird relationship without her knowing because I never talk to her in fear that I'll ruin our once perfectly okay relationship. She's so special to me that I want to leave her alone. She's almost like some sort of goddess, in a... weird way of putting it.

My stupid mind just won't shut the hell up about this oh my god. At the most random moments I am bombarded by my mind screaming at me, ""she's going to die and there's nothing you can do about it."" And it makes me really distressed, to say the least, knowing that she *will* die and there's nothing I can do about it. Yes, I know... it's a distorted thought. But no amount of rational thinking will change my mind. She will *die.* 

The best way to relieve some of my worries is to just text her myself. I did about a week ago, but she hasn't responded.  Not to be that stereotypical dramatic teen but it genuinely did make me very distressed to the point of spiraling to breakdowns and panic attacks multiple times. I feel that because I've failed to be a good friend, she's slowly checking off all the things on that list I mentioned a few paragraphs back. 

Here's my thought process: *she's ignoring because she hates me. She's probably with her other friends laughing at how sad it is that I think we're still friends. Or she's already dead and didn't tell me because I made her feel like I didn't care.*

Yeah. Not fun.

Friendships shouldn't be like this. Healthy friendships, that is. It's not a one-sided thing. I shouldn't have to constantly worry about her health and safety. I should just be a normal person and remain a good friend. But no. My mind just... doesn't work like that for some damn reason.  I'm sick of it. I just want her to live and be happy. And I want to live her best life even if that means one without me, though I also desperately want to be a part of hers.

See? This is why I don't get close to others. It never ends well.",31Jul2020,1

149,"*tw for bdd and unhealthy relationship with food*

This is a cold truth. I am ugly. Its an issue I deal with every day. Seeing my face and body in the mirror makes me want to cry and just dissappear. 

Ever since the age of 12, I've felt ugly. Before that I'd been a normal child who didn't worry about appearances. Going to secondary school was hard. Young girls grew into themselves, learned how to use makeup and stye their hair, while I was left in the dust. Freckled face, thick framed ugly glasses, pimple and dirty skin, frizzy hair. I was the ugly friend, the one used as a joke 'why don't you date her' the following 'eww, no way' even as predictable as it was still knocked my already low self confidence. All my friends had a least one boyfriend by 15, no boy had ever been interested in my properly. *TW next part describes unhealthy eating habits and body issues*
At age 14 I was fed up of being ugly. I decided if I could achieve a perfect face I would achieve a perfect body. I tried diets eating well under the required calories and really harmed my body. At the time I was already underweight but my mind pushed to me I was ugly, so I was also not thin I was flabby and dumpy. Photos I took at the time made me cry that I looked fat and ugly, looking back I was thin but still ugly.

At 15 something happened with my friends. I was alone. I ate lunch in the toilets, I was very down for a few months. My eating habits got worse. I stopped eating, I tried to make records for how long I didn't eat. The longest was only 2 days but it wasn't healthy. My mind was a mess. Only losing weight could make me happy. I made new friends and started to take care of my skin and hair. I felt a lot better. But my feelings of inferiority never completely went away.

I'm writing this because I don't know what to do. I just looked at mt face how others would see it and broke down. My face is so assymetrical. Worse than it has ever been. I thought I was okay but it's not. When I asked family they agreed with me. It is assymetrical. One eyebrow is higher than the other,nose is not straight and my eyes are different shapes.

Another thing that set me off was to controll the urges to starve myself again, I'm eating healthy and excersizing. I lost about 4kg that I'd gained from eating so much junk food before lock down but have been constantly at a weight I'm happy at. I have been eating 2000 calories a day and excersizing 30 minutes a day. When I first saw my friends afte lock down they remarked how scary I looked. How thin, how naturally I'm not like this and I need more weight (I am naturally thin and always had been). They told me go to a doctor to prove its not healthy and I'm being an idiot but they don't care as I'm harming only myself. That really annoyed me, I asked my grandmother and she said their was no change in me. It's annoying that these said friends didn't care when I tried to open up about this to them, it made them uncomfortable and they shut off the conversation and just told me to eat and love myself.

Anyways I rambled too much. I'm writing this as I have nobody else to tell. I feel everyone I try to talk to doesn't care or acts disgusted by me. Today I felt so horrible my face is different looking on both sides, it's like two people. I wanted to talk to someone but I have nobody. I just want advice on what I can do. I can now",31Jul2020,1

### T/w : Anxiety

Anxiety. A three syllable word that is an uninvited guest in a lot of lives these days.

I have struggled with anxiety all my life. There is this voice inside my head that constantly tells me I am not good enough. Not smart enough. Not pretty enough. It was loud and bold and quickly became integral part of me. My entire life revolved around fueling this toxic relationship

Every time I took a day off to relax, to spend time with my friends or to just spend some time with myself, this demon would whisper in my ears. Soft at first, and then louder as the day went by. By the end of the day I felt so terrible that I pushed myself exuberantly hard the next day. And the vicious cycle continued.

I recognized it every now and then, when people around me seemed to be a lot more content and tranquil than I was. I was constantly jittery and doing a mental calculation of all the things I didn’t do in a day. And it became a habit. One I fueled and encouraged all the time.

And I convinced myself I was okay, that it was normal to feel this way. To be incredibly successful and still feel small. To never be at peace, to constantly second guess and doubt yourself. It was only when I started manifesting physical symptoms, that I was really worried. My eyes would twitch and I would constantly shake my legs. I would get headaches and stomach upsets on a daily basis. My body was forcing me to take notice of this demon. But I still ignored it. I was in love.

152,"I can't quite place when this started, but it has been the most noticeable since lockdown was first announced here in the UK. I truly thought it wouldn't affect me that much because I don't mind staying inside, and I get out of doing stressful exams, but I've come to realise it may have after all.

On my last ever day of school I did cry, but that was triggered from seeing someone else cry. Even now I still don't really feel that much of anything with regards to finishing school, when I should be sad or nostalgic about it.

A couple of days ago I lost a lot of old messages because I switched phones. When this happened to me a few years back I was so unbelievably angry because I like keeping messages to reminisce etc, but this time I literally didn't care. I definitely have been angry/short-tempered for other reasons though.

Finally, I lost a lot of interest in learning. Psychology has always been something that fascinated me and I was excited to have all this free time to look into it now, but I don't get the same buzz anymore. It's like I see something and go 'wow that's interesting' but I don't actually feel that. I worried I was losing interest in the subject completely which is especially terrifying since I'm supposed to be studying it at uni in a couple of months, but seeing how I've felt in other aspects of my life maybe it's not just a coincidence.

I'm wondering if anyone has ever felt this before, or knows how I can address it? I thought it would pass over time but it's been 4 months of lockdown now and not much has changed. Thanks.",31Jul2020,1
153,"I haven't felt happiness for over 7 years, I've dropped out of school and I've lost interest in any hobby I've ever had.

To make up for this I've been forcing myself to be in constant sadness every day. Sadness was all I had, it was a comfortable feeling... it was a feeling. But a few weeks ago I lost the ability to feel sad, I've done research and found out that I've become numb, most likely due to recent stressful events that I don't want to go into detail with. I hate it. I feel every second slowly passing by. I have nothing to comfort me and I don't know what to do except to turn to self harm since it's the only thing that gives me feeling anymore.",31Jul2020,1

I have decided this year not to go back to play sports, because COVID is high around here, and football has not been canceled. My entire family believes I am simply using it as a lazy way out, but I’m genuinely concerned for my dads health because he has breathing issues from years of smoking and well if he gets it from somewhere it’s not gonna be from me.

before this I've been having alot of thoughts about my ex,(who was emotionally &amp; physically abusive), I'm not sure if that has any effect. 

My panic attacks normally include shaking, dizziness, nausea, feeling detached from reality, feeling weak/about to pass out, increased heart rate, then eventually crying. this feeling normally lasts for like 1 - 3 hours? then after a while it happens again, this has been happening for the past 5 days. Does anyone deal with this too and have any coping mechanisms? i've tried breathing techniques but they just dont work for me, (i have a bit of an issue with breathing so that might be the problem?) any help is much appreciated :)",31Jul2020,1

I've been dealing with the social security crap for the last 2 years and a couple days ago they denied my for a 2nd time.  Even with a lawyer.  I was really hoping and counting on this to come through so I had some sort of income while I work to get better.  I can't explain just how defeating and deflating this is. I'm not able to work with my PTSD issues. My psychiatrist and psychologist even filled out a form saying I can't work. I just don't know what the hell I'm going to do now. It feels like all this progress I've been making turned out to not be worth it. I do have a place to stay thankfully so I am thankful for that.

I'm at this point where I am very unhappy with how my body looks. I just feel overweight and obese to the point where I want to starve myself just so I'm happy in my own body. But I absolutely hate wasting food so if my parents give me food (I'm 13F btw) I can't throw it away because I won't let myself.

So I thought OK ill just do vigorous exercises after I eat but my depression just drains me of energy so I just can't.

I'm sorry if I offended anyone by saying I had depression without being diagnosed)

163,"F 20 (anxiety, depression, ptsd, going through an adhd diagnosis now). Just wondering if anybody else experiences throwing up when going through intense emotional distress? When I was 17, I threw up a lot after my mom passed away and I had to move out of my house to a new state with estranged family. I had thought it was a combination of food poisoning and mental exhaustion from packing up my whole life in a day and seeing family I hardly knew. Flash forward some years to now, and I am very much healing and in a much better place, but my fiancé (my rock, the person I spend everyday with and have not been apart from for more than 3 days at a time in 2 years) recently got picked up for Navy OCS, and today I had to take him to the airport. After bouts of extreme crying and gagging, when I got back home I began throwing up. This is a very similar feeling as when my mom died, including the prolonged nausea I had during both occasions. I literally had to sedate myself today. 

TLDR, noticing pattern of vomiting and nausea during extreme emotional distress, has anybody experienced this/know any tips to avoid this reaction healthily?",31Jul2020,1

Then couple of days later she was drunk and we were fighting and she screamed at me something like how could I and no man will ever like me with scars and that no one else in our family does that and that I am probably broken or some shit. Next day she didn’t remember I guess cause she didn’t talk about it anymore. Fast forward a few weeks today, she saw my fresh scars on my hands ( I have been clean for a long time but I broke again) and told me that she doesn’t understand why am I doing this and we started fighting again and she told me that it’s my body and I told her to stop talking about it because she doesn’t want to help and find me a therapist. She then has the audacity to ask something like : Are you sick that you need a therapist? And I was like, YES I THINK I MIGHT. And now we are not taking. I feel like she blames me for everything and doesn’t care about her flaws... don’t know what to do anymore and I am only fifteen, I fucking can’t anymore. Sorry, just wanted to share.

I don’t match a lot of symptoms for anxiety or depression or whatever. But I do have low self esteem I suppose. It’s probably related to that perhaps? 

I guess I’m trying to understand if there is a need to improve or maybe I’m fine the way I am and it’s just a matter of acceptance. I have made a lot of improvements recently and I’m still in the process of changing but I hate my personality sometimes. I sometimes imagine what people must think of me. I have had comments that goes with those beliefs. 

I feel like for the last 10 years I’ve had self esteem issues and I think it doesn’t help that before I had a very different life. People would gravitate towards me and I had a lot more success socially but now I lost that spark but I have recently got a job I am impressed with considering I never thought I’d achieve that with my low self esteem.

Right now I can‘t envision a happy future and views that were major parts of my personality have changed because I suddenly can‘t think like I used to anymore and don‘t feel the same passion and emotional attachment towards them.

Until now I could always envision a happy future with the interests I enjoyed and suddenly I don‘t feel anything thinking about it. 

Suddenly I‘m thinking about things I didn‘t like or hated and wonder if it would make me happy while logically I know it won‘t.
It‘s so weird and I don‘t know what to do.
Is this just a phase I‘m going through?

I‘m trying to not make any rash decisions now as I know this isn‘t how I normally am and I feel like I‘ve become a completely different person over night which I don‘t like.
I liked myself. I don‘t want to change this way.

It‘s so weird. I don‘t have a background of depression and there isn‘t an emotional trigger either. 
I just woke up one day and felt this way and I don‘t know why.

It‘s such a sudden change in personality and thoughts/ thought process.
I don‘t really know what to do.

Could this be mental or maybe a medical condition? 

I do have some stress right now but it‘s nothing major and definitely not the worst stress I ever had.
Also I had to lay off medication for my hypothyroidism and I‘m on birth control which I never had any side effects for in the past.

I (26) am a  male and this is my first time asking a real question about mentality issues and looking for some insight from other guys.  This reason I didn’t post this to r/depression is because I didn’t want people with pre-dispositions about depression to give me advice.   I was born here after my parents and a couple aunts and uncles moved from the Caribbean to get a better life.  My parents did better than anyone could of asked them to do and gave everything I could ask for given what we had.  We lived in what a lot of people would call the “hood”.  If I’m being honest it taught me a lot of “street rules” and critical thinking beyond books could teach. Due to my parents drilling education into my brain, I was able to go to some of the best public schools NYC has to offer.  Then I went of to college and graduated and got a job I’ve been at for 4 years.  

Fast-forward to the me of today. What spurred this post was really months of self reflection and constant monitoring of my actions.  I started smoking weed pretty regularly and it gave me a different perspective to view my life from and has honestly boosted my relationship with my close friends and family but I’ve also taken a really hard look at myself and realized I might not be in the best place.  I have a phenomenal girlfriend that has never failed to support me even though in the earlier years of our relationship I was a tyrant and sometimes I still catch myself doing that and have to reset.  For example, her mom’s birthday was a couple days ago but I feel so anxious around being near her family that I try to fold up into something small and disappear; so I didn’t even get her a card. My girlfriend’s bday was last month and we went on a picnic that I ruined by being miserable all day and ruining it. I didn’t even get her flowers or a card.  Yesterday I did some reflection and went out and got some cards but haven’t  written in them yet. The sum of that little excerpt is to show that I know when I’m wrong and I want it to change. 

The job I work at I’ve been at for 4 years and I’ve gained some valuable skills but they haven’t really given me anything to be proud about.  I’ve gone in and out of school during working to get another degree but I  quit even though I did so well in all my classes.  I’ve always wanted to have a career working for e-sports or anything video game related.  Being at this job for so long and not feeling good about it pushed me into being more aggressive about finding a career somewhere I can feel fulfillment and a part of something. I joined an alumni group of a frat I was a part of in college,  I was happy I was in it but still felt pretty lonely. I reached out to a guy who posted in there and he referred me to a person who could help me find a job about 3 weeks ago and I still haven’t contacted him. Every time I pick up the phone I get so nervous that I’m not enough for what people want and I put it down.  I have an unfinished LinkedIn profile and a redone resumè  that haven’t sent to anyone because I’m scared of how it pales in comparison to other resumès.  

I feel like I lack all the self-confidence I once had. I put my social mask on everyday and hope people leave me be. I was never like this, I always felt like the life of the party. I loved talking to people. I want to love life again. I want to feel motivated and inspired again.  I just constantly feel empty and that I’m never going to be good enough to be happy. That I don’t deserve anything good and this is how it’ll always be.  Am in a stage of depression or is this just how life goes in your 20’s. I don’t know how to be ok with this. I don’t know how to make it change. I don’t know where to look for some guidance, or an outstretched hand.

What I mean by this: I have a hard time feeling love or affections for people. It is possible but it takes a long time for me to do. 

This isn't really a problem until people get hurt or die and I don't feel sad at all from it even when I knew them. When I was 7 years old my mother sadly passed away but I never went through any grief. Recently an aquaintance from school has passed and I have felt nothing for it. 

I don't know if this is related or not but I also seem to get angry or annoyed when my boyfriend texts more than I am happy. I don't feel like I feel the love that most people do for their loved ones but I do want to date him.

I know this doesn't sound believable, but I have managed to keep it hidden from my boyfriend, but it's been really hot recently and last night I slept in some long shorts.
Well, I was asleep and they must have ridden up my leg and revealed all my burns and my partner saw them.

I am so upset with myself, I kept them hidden from him as I didn't want him to have to deal with the stress of me doing that. I feel awful that he has had to see them. He tried to talk to me about it, but I was so annoyed with myself for letting it slip that I didn't even know what to say.

What do you think I should say to him? Should I just pretend like it never happened, or would it be best to discuss it with him?

I love my parents but I’m not sure how therapy can help me if I’m immediately put back into a situation that threatens the better mental health I’ve been building for myself. I try so hard to be understood and to explain why those things have affected me but said parent doesn’t seem to understand and instead of reacting with compassion, lashes out and gets confrontational.

193,"My last two emails requesting an appointment haven’t been answered. Not sure if I should try calling or start looking for a new therapist. Tbh my experience with this current therapist has been just ok anyway. It’s just that finding the right one is such a drag. 

I’ve started feeling hopeless about getting better and getting the right help. I’ve seen so many therapists throughout my adult life and only one has made a significant impact. This was through my university insurance so I had to terminate services once I graduated. 

Any advice for coming out of a mental health plateau?",31Jul2020,1
194,"Could my grandma be mentally ill or getting dementia. 

My grandma often talks to herself. Not really thinking out loud or critically thinking about something, but mostly making statements of things she's going to do right before it and things she's done right after. Or just stating her thoughts on something or making an onomatopoeia. For example ""Oooofff! I don't see ants."" After looking out the window. ""I am going to grab the carrot"". While grabbing a carrot. She's not talking to me and I hear this when she's alone in other parts of the house as well. I read that it could be a hearing problem, but her hearing is good.

She also talks to herself in third person, some examples are (not using her real name). ""Mildred you silly silly girl"", when she forgot to add something to her meal im guessing. ""Mildred you naughty girl"", after cutting someone off driving around a curve with another car coming in the other direction, this happens often. ""Good job Mildred!"". It just seems weird to me since I don't do it myself, and haven't come across anyone in my friend group or family that does this.

I know she has memory problems now. She's thrown silverware in the trash, accused me of stealing things she's misplaced, already ate/used, haven't bought yet. I'm not sure if it's delusion or just hypocritical behavior but she often says things that contradicts herself or believes in things, except the rule does not apply to her. For example she believes the rich shall give all to the poor but says charities don't need her donations since many people donate (she's very wealthy she married 2 CEO's that have now passed). When I tried to throw away moldy or food that has gone off in the fridge she'd say a little bacteria builds immunity, I asked her if she'd eat it and she refuses, but wants me to eat it. I have my own food I pay for so I just eat my own food.

I know I'm venting a little bit but I don't know if I should get her help. I talk to her often and just try to be as agreeable as possible to make her feel good but I'm beginning to get burnt out since I have my own issues, work and preparing for school. Should I mention this to our doctor? She doesn't believe in mental illness and denies things often I always feel like she's oppressing herself so I don't know if it'll work. How should I approach this? Should I tell her kids first?

tl;dr: my grandma talks to herself, talks in third person sometimes, has memory problems, accusatory, delusional or hypocritical?, should I get her help?",31Jul2020,1

197,"I know this sounds so overdramatic, but I had a situation that left me very hurt and I don’t know how to move forward. For background, making art is one of my biggest passions and I use it to openly express my deepest feelings. So, my boyfriend of 3 years is working on a project that he wants his artist friends to make art for. The other day, we were with his friends and he was excitedly asking one if she would make art for it and talking about the other people he was going to ask. I was kind of hurt that he was asking all these people and not me, because again, art is a huge passion of mine. I brought it up to him later, asking why he didn’t want me to contribute. He said that he doesn’t view me as an artist, doesn’t associate me with making art, the art I’ve made and shown him didn’t speak to him or “fit his aesthetic”, etc. I understand now that my art isn’t his taste and doesn’t fit the look of his project, and if that was all he told me, there wouldn’t be a problem. What’s hurting me so much is that he said he doesn’t see me as an artist or associate me with making art. I make art everyday and, just because it isn’t his taste, it doesn’t mean I’m not an artist. I hate knowing he sees his friends as artists, but not me. I feel completely heartbroken. He’s the only person who I need to see me for me, and he made me feel completely unseen. It’s like such a huge part of me doesn’t  exist to him. He said he’s sorry that what he said hurt me and that he won’t bring up art anymore, but I still feel so hurt. It sounds so stupid and like not a real problem, but I’m in so much pain over it and I don’t really know how to go on with my life.",31Jul2020,1
198,"One week ago, my mental health went down like a switch being flipped. And I'm not sure why.

Some background: This is quarantine. I am an introverted person by nature so I had no problem with being productive on my own, and cutting social media for around 2 months. All was well. I felt a bit lonely at times sure, and I had no physical activity for pretty long, I also was a bit worried about losing friends (I had a counter argument of most of them are negative and I don't want that around me anyways). But my mental health was great. I was focused on my goals and everyday working hard to achieve them. 

Suddenly, 7 days ago, I got an anxiety/panic attack for the first time. And that was like a switch being flipped regarding my mental health. My mind became dominated by negative thoughts rather than positive ones. 

4 days after that attack I learned more about what happened, and realized that I'm not losing my mind, that it's just anxiety and that I can combat it with exercising regularly. So I started that 2 days ago, and I'm feeling better now, acknowledging that it was a one time experience. 

But, I still feel loneliness, depression at nighttime (some of the days), some anxiety (but I'm confident exercising will gradually get rid of it), and in general worse mental health than before that happened. I also feel a sense of isolation from the world, and started seeing people as more like machines than well, people, which makes me feel disconnected. Probably that's because of me thinking too much about the psychology of others (part of what I do in design). But it's disturbing, and makes me afraid that it's something more than just anxiety, that my mind is slipping aways. 

There is no other time I felt more like I need some reassurance and help from someone. I am not who I was before 7 days ago. And I'm hoping that I'm going to recover slowly and go back to my normal mindset. But I need someone, and I don't feel like I really have any close relationships at this point to tell them any of this, so I turned to this subreddit.",31Jul2020,1
199,"This post is not a ""look at me"" post, it is to truly help both the victims and TR's to understand whats happening in these situations. It all started after high school when in a years time when I went from weird background kid to very good looking, gym going, successful young adult. I somehow obtained my high school sweetheart who was probably the best looking girl in my school and life was bliss...for a few months. The newfound feeling of being constantly hit on and complimented drew my attention away from the thing I had so bad wanted and thought was impossible to attain for so long. Eventually the relationship became routine and she broke up with me. Yea, I was heartbroken and thought I was back to square one. I kept working out and working on my style and this is when the genuine transformation happened. 

I never knew until a month ago (now 25 yo) that I was doing something wrong after the relationship, but I'm sure some of you will be able to relate. Toxic romanticism I would say is when you tell a partner or partners that you are not looking for a relationship, then engaging in a casual relationship that you knowingly take too far to make them gain interest and acquire sincere interest in you just to semi-gaslight them in the end saying ""but I told you I wasn't looking for love."" You cuddle, hold hands, go on dates, meet their parents, all in the name of sport while knowing you are playing the part of prince charming just because you can. 

I have realized this behavior about two or three months ago and have stopped engaging in it, but in this hiatus I have received 3 heartbreaking texts from girls begging for closure or another chance saying they ""know I felt something"" or things of that nature. I am not toxic in the sense of cheating or being abusive in any way but for some reason I cant just have sex and leave, but I'm also not looking for a relationship, so how do I get help and stop hurting people? 

I don't want to fake build up to love with every girl I meet, and I don't even know if I'll ever be able to fall in love for real because I NEVER KNOW I'M DOING IT until randomly one day I lose interest. It fucking hurts to see myself in the 3rd person like this but I don't want to be like this. I love opening up to new people, sharing my weird hobbies and interests with them, and introducing them to my friends, but in the end I just simply do not want to continue sexually or romantically and end up letting them know at the flick of a switch that we can't proceed...leading to a need for closure or explanation. I'm tired of not being able to sleep knowing I'm a source of pain in other peoples life because I have a very strong backing as being of very kind heart and a good guy, but this aspect of my life rips me apart.",31Jul2020,1

201,"Last week we talked about the [differences between individualistic and collectivistic cultures](https://heem.substack.com/p/introducing-individualism-and-collectivism). For me, understanding these two concepts helped me understand a lot of things about myself. I wasn’t aware of it at the time, but I realize now that I grew up essentially living within two cultures.

As a second generation Korean American, I was the first in my family to be born in the U.S. My mom, dad, and brother were all born in South Korea.

At home, my family was culturally Korean. I grew up with collectivistic values such as honoring my parents, placing others above myself, and making the family a priority. But everywhere else, I was living in an individualistic society. This included school, tennis camp on weekday nights, playing with kids in my neighborhood, to even watching T.V. As a result, these two two value systems would occasionally come into conflict with one another. Here are two stories that illustrate how this internal conflict affected me and how I processed through them.

## Sadies Hawkins Dance

When I was a Junior in High School, there was a dance called “Sadies Hawkins” where it was tradition for the girls to ask the guys out. Now there was a girl named Sam who was a Senior. We met at an after school tutoring clinic where we spent 5 days a week preparing for the S.A.T.’s.

When Sadies Hawkins came around that year, she ended up asking me to go to the dance with her and I was stunned. Never would I have imagined that she would ask me. Especially because she was a Senior, was popular, and was on the basketball team.

I told her I wanted to but had to first check with my parents. You see that year I was doing terribly academically. I had gotten 4 C’s in the first semester and my parents were furious. So when I asked them if I could go to this dance, my parents said, “No” because they wanted me to spend more time studying.

I was crushed and conflicted. There was a part of me that wanted to go. But there was another part of me that wanted to respect my parent’s decision. My mind started scheming about different ways I could sneak out that night and maybe trick my parents. But in the end, my collectivistic values won and I decided to tell Sam that I couldn’t go.

To this day I still regret it. Haha. But to be honest, I think I would have regretted it either way. Why? Because my choices were:

* Go to the Sadies Hawkins dance, regret breaking my parent’s trust, and feel guilt and shame.
* Don’t go and regret the fun night I would’ve had with Sam.

This was a lose-lose situation. No matter what decision I made, I felt like I was going to regret my decision. Unfortunately, this was something I faced throughout a majority of my life. In fact, it was rare for me to feel completely at peace whenever I made difficult decisions because it would always conflict with one of the two cultural values.

## Leaving Home

In my early-20’s, I stayed with my parents as I was going to grad school for seminary. It helped me save money on rent and let me be physically close to my parents. However, when I got into CSUF to pursue a career in Marriage and Family Therapy I decided to move out.

In the last newsletter, we talked about how it was culturally common for children in collectivistic families to live with their parents. In fact, it’s expected. So this was a really hard decision to make because I knew this would be a painful experience. Not because they were demanding obedience, but because I knew they would perceive it as a rejection of their love, which I wasn’t doing, and I didn’t want to hurt them. I just simply had reached a point in my life where I realized I couldn’t be happy living with them.

And it’s not because they’re terrible parents or terrible human beings. They were loving and patient for the most part and I love them to death. But I felt like I just couldn’t grow as a person and I couldn’t explore my independence as an adult. Whenever I created boundaries or asserted myself at home, it always ended up in fights or misunderstandings. I hated that this was happening. It was slowly destroying our relationship…but I refused to let that continue.

I decided to move out because something had to change. Although it would be painful in the beginning, I believed it would help us in the long run. Thankfully after a lot of hard work, I’m confident in saying that it has.

Now it wasn’t the smoothest process. It took a while for our relationship to adjust to a new dynamic. I made a lot of mistakes and so did they. But I believe we are in a lot healthier place now than where we were before.

It was during is time that I finally recognized that my core values were more individualistic than collectivistic. This gave me peace of mind because I began to finally accept myself. I started to not feel guilty about my decisions. Rather than constantly fluctuating between the two value systems and being in seemingly lose-lose situations, I become more comfortable and confident in myself.

Now I still hold onto collectivistic values. I just recognize that what motivates the core of my decisions are individualistic in nature. And that’s okay. But how I navigated this realization within the context of a collectivistic-oriented family is another story for another week.

202,"Last year for my freshman year of college, I started journaling everyday with colored pens that represented my mood or a significant thing that happened.

I have 3 full journals right now and I did it through the summer, so about almost a year I have done it.

Do you think I should continue it this year?

I really enjoyed it during school when something would happen and I could reflect on it, and I really like it because I can go back to like ""oh what happened on October 17th"" and I can remember what exactly happened. But some days I would just feel lazy and not want to do it.

I had an eye opening experience with my mental health last year and so I thought I would start journaling to track it, but now I don't know if I should continue.

It's starting to feel like something I feel like I have to do not something I want to do.

I have this app, dailyio, which is a mood tracker and it does the year in pixels that you can see. It has Great, Happy, sad, meh, bad (you can edit them/create your own) and then you can add activities like things you did/felt that day, and then a place to write about it. So I've been doing that, too.

But doing both just seems a bit much at the moment. I'm not sure if I don't like it just because I'm not/haven't been doing much if at all during the summer, so maybe I'll change my mind once school starts.

I know this is a question really only I can answer, but I just wanted to know your thoughts on journalling. I like being able to see what happened everyday, but it just feels like something I have to do now.",31Jul2020,1

204,"During lockdown I have clearly had some sort of existential crisis within the last few days, this lockdown has been affecting me since May I have done nothing to better myself or adapt to the change we now find ourselves in. I have essentially treated my lockdown, my social isolation and my frequent shielding as an extremely long and never ending day off. I am, by Einstein's definition, insane I have done the same thing over and over again since May. It is not the most intelligent or strongest which survives but the one most adaptative to change, I have recently found out about Simon Sinek and his lectures, ted talks and books on leadership which has spoken to me. 

I have been playing, since May, only focusing on getting back to work which I start next month and associated everything else as losing. My fiancee is a key/essential worker and when she comes home she is tired, fatigued and worn out from work and just wants to relax by watching tv. All I have wanted since May is to talk and chat to her, I have associated talking to her attune to winning and everything else as losing. I have been playing a game against something that isn't even playing, there are no defined rules except those I have dubbed myself arbitrarily . 

This all ends now. I have a gratitude journal, I have focused on bettering myself within the last couple of days and as of today stopped playing the game. I have stopped playing the game against something that isn't even playing, there should be no winning or losing as if I focus on getting back to work as winning and everything else as losing when something else happens, I will have no coping mechanisms I may win each battle but I will eventually lose the war.

229,"I know this may not be a big deal, but whenever I am in extremely stressful situations like a heated conversation I can't stop crying. Especially with my family, and in quarantine it has just got worse.
Am I the only one who cries at the weirdest times?",31Jul2020,1
230,"I’m worried and I don’t know what to do. He deals with really difficult/abusive people everyday, usually people with poor mental health, mental disabilities, alcohol dependency, and drug addictions. Usually they have a concoction of all of the above. He’s come home in the past having had people he was trying to help overdose and die. Also, verbal/physical attacks on him are pretty common. 

The stress of it all completely devours him. He is very committed to his clients and puts in hours of extra (unpaid) overtime every single day - around 20 hours extra a week. And at the end of the day he says he feels like he accomplished nothing, which is primarily due to the nature of his work. So he comes home beaten down and it takes hours to perk him back up and bring him back to life. 

But despite my best efforts, it’s getting worse. He’s started having severe nightmares and goes into these like convulsion- things in his sleep where he shouts and his arms and legs move chaotically. Usually the bed is saturated with sweat and I have to literally hold him like a child to get him to calm down. 

I knew it was getting worse but I wasn’t expecting what happened today. He was at work and calls me and says he’s been in a car accident. Nobody was hurt, thankfully, but he told me that it happened because he was rushing around &amp; his mind was on so many things that he lost concentration and completely smashed into the car in front of him. Then he proceeded to work for another 3 hours!!!! (he’s still not home yet so might be more) and didn’t even go to a doctor because he says he’s fine. Thankfully the other driver wasn’t hurt and was really nice about it. 

I just never realised how little support there is for workers out there trying to support others with bad mental health/addictions. I’ve researched and am coming up with nothing. Please if anybody has any tips it would be much appreciated. It’s got to the stage where he’s endangering himself and others. I should add that he’s very stubborn and won’t admit that his mental health is suffering. He’s kind of old fashioned and constantly insists that he’s okay (he’s more concerned with me getting worried than his own mental health)",31Jul2020,1
231,"Not really sure if this is the right sub but any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

My friend has been dating a girl for about a year now who suffers from mental health issues. I'm not entirely sure what's going on I do know she is incredibly bad anxiety to the point where she physically cannot speak to people most of the time. She's been in and out of mental institutions and abused physically and verbally in all of them. Her parents are messed up too, I know her mother bullies her about her weight even though there's nothing wrong with it. The only source of good in her life is my friend who's dating her.
My friend doesn't want to date her anymore, he can't take it anymore and she does a lot of hardcore drugs and has gotten my friend addicted to xans.
My friend told me recently that she told him if he ever leaves her she'll kill herself, but it's not just some way to get attention or keep them from leaving it's he's literally the only thing in her life that gives her a reason to live. But he can't take it anymore, he doesn't want to be with her anymore but he doesn't want her to kill herself.
I feel bad for the girl but at the same time he's one of my closest friends and I hate to see him go down this path, ever since he's been dating her he's been severely depressed and has to be high or drunk 24/7 it seems.

Are there any good options for a situation like this?",31Jul2020,1
232,"I have no idea what the hell to do about it either.

I know exactly where it comes from. I was heavily bullied throughout all of high school and still am to some extent nowadays at 24 (though now I can stand up for myself once things get too far), but in a general sense I expect most of my interactions to be received positively.

I also have no problems with social interactions in general, like going to a coffeeshop, meeting up with friends, talking to college teachers, voicing an opinion or asking a question in a conference, etc. But any time there's any sort of perceived power dynamic, things go down the drain. If I'm in a group with unknown people (1 is enough), I freeze up. If I'm hanging out with people I don't know one-on-one, I freeze up, etc. 

Constant comparassions are a thing too, with extreme self-hatred following it. So if me and another person are equally new to a group but the other person is able to crack jokes for example, then suddenly the thing is I'm not funny. Or if the person appears talkative or to be more well-received, it's either because I'm not confident or good looking respectively. Stuff like that. It gets even worse if I actually do try to say something and I'm either ignored or it's just not well received. If this happens then the self-hatred will easily turn into mild self harm like hardly hitting a wall or scratching my knuckles against one until I'm crying with pain.

So for example I am on an internship right now. There 6 other long-term employees working at the place who've all been there for a while. They are extremely nice people. Today one older gentleman offered me a cake because he was going on vaccation, but I didn't get the chance to thank him at the time because he just left it at my table. As I was leaving I thought it would be nice to thank him, obviously. But I actually had to sit there for 5-10 minutes only to find the courage to *thank* somebody. It would be too awkward to walk into the main office just to thank him, so I had to do it while leaving. And I knew ""Thanks for the cake, Mr. 'Tony' (Tony is a made up name lol)"" was too long of a sentence for me to say while being extremely nervous, and I knew my voice would rush and crack up...

And that's exactly what happened. I tried to say it, but my voice was rushed and cracked so he didn't understand me and went ""Uh... What?"". So I paused and stood still in the middle of the fucking hallway for 10-15 seconds deciding whether to just leave or actually go back and repeat it. I decided to just leave. And for my last 3 hours my mind has been going ""You're pathetic, you can't even control yourself enough to get 5 words out. And now he thinks you were insulting him. And every other employee is thinking you're pathetic too. You're probably going to get fired from the internship, or at the very least you won't fit in with anyone else, again"". For 3 fucking hours. This is the kind of shit I have to deal with daily.

I've been to 2 psychologists so far (one when I was younger, one in college), and they have both been shit. The last one was actually a nice person and she cared a lot, but she still did nothing for me. I will never understand why the go-to response both of them had when I talked to them about being ignored or not being welcomed by a particular group or being bullied is always ""Are you sure that comment was directed at you / are you sure they meant it personally?"". Who the fuck cares??? That doesn't help shit. Neither does hyping up any positive reaction. Yet this seems to be the standard ""treatment"". 

I want to keep my confidence no matter what kind of reactions I have, positive or negative. Dismissing the negative reactions and hyping up the positive ones as being validating experiences only makes me more reaction-seeking and even more frustrated/angry with myself when I don't manage to repeat that success. Not to mention I have several events where it's undeniable I was the target of certain comments, and where the question ""Are you sure you were the target?"" falls flat, and yet the discussion about those never gets far. How come 2 different psychologists not understand this even after I clearly explain several times that their argumentation doesn't work? Is there no other treatment plan, is that all they have? 

Man, I really don't know what to do.",31Jul2020,1
233,"Im 16 female. Recently ive been worrying if im a stalker and its really bothering me. Im thinking this way because when i had my first boyfriend i was 13 (online) like hed sometimes send me pics of him but it was meh. So he told me his school and i was like oh surely they have school pics of him so i looked up the school website and there was nothing so i tried his school youtube and there was also nothing but i knew one of his friends who was a girl and shes really pretty so i was looking through her insta to see if he commented anything and id like look at her insta a bit cause she was just really pretty and looked happy and i enjoyed it.. Then i had like alot of boyfriends(also online) when i was like 14 and like i did this thing well i still do it now. I imagine scenarios in my head but to see the person clearly in my head i look up pictures of them say on instagram or facebook so i can visualize them better in my head. So one day i tried looking for one of my boy friends mum on insta to see if she had any pics of him but her account was private so i was like nah im not going to click on it. Then a different boyfriend i looked through his followers to see if they had any family pics so i could see him and i found his sisters. And i just get lost in like peoples lives so i was just looking through all of his sisters pics seeing how her life is. Then i also kept going back to her account to see pics of him well after i broke up so i could imagine him better. Then i had this crush on a boy in my school and i really liked him i was like 13 and on snapchat id like constantly check his snap maps idk why but i just kept checking them alot i think to see if he was active on snap and messaging others or to see where he was. And then if another girl spoke to him in school id get so jealous. Then one day he said to me oh you could live near me because my neighbour is moving so i was like omg yesss and i told my mum and then i started imagining scenarios of me bumping into him on the way to school etc. I eventually stopped liking him. I also knew where he lived cause of snap maps. Then after i had all those boyfriends i had a crush on this boy like a big one. So in school i wanted him to come talk to me but i was so shy and im socially awkward so id like take my friends to sit near where they would so i could watch him to see if hed come over and talk to me. But this became like constant like every lunch id try and find him in the cafeteria or be there early just so i could see him or id walk by where he was chilling or id stay there just so he could look at me and then id have like a fake convo with my friends or id stay hanging by this area which i knew hed walk passed at like a certain time. Then i used to like always look at his insta like just constantly looking at him cause he was so cute and so i could imagine the scenarios. Then i knew he had a friendship group and they seemed like a good bunch of people so i started speaking to like 1 of them and he was nice and then i found all their instas and then came the looking at the pics and then imagining scenarios like constantly(while listening to music). Also i kinda like spied on him whenever he was with girls and his ex was talking to him and i got so pissed and then i looked up her insta and started looking through comments to see what he had said on them and then he liked  this other  girl so i started comparing us like what does she have that i dont.Then we ended up going out together and i really wanted to be in his group and meet his friends but i didnt because we broke up. After we broke up i started looking at his snap maps and. i was like omfg he got a girl over his house wtf why is there a girl there omg they are on their own. Then i still liked him but then i met these other 2 boys that i liked and i rejected one but ended up falling for a right dick. Then that guy like just stopped bothering with me but i also started looking at his insta to imagine stuff in my head whilst i got music in. Then i fell out with the boy i rejected over pics and he was just a prick but i also used to do the insta thingy. Then i met another boy who was really sweet and i liked him but then he was like nooope. And im like really shy around boys i like at the beginning but then i get ok. Then we stopped talking and he blocked me. I also used to talk to his friend who was nice. Then i started imagining scenarios with him in my head the boy who went off me and then id purposely walk by him or where hed be heading so hed see me or come talk to me cause i did still like him but i wouldnt look at him cause i get nervous. But his friends would say shit to me like shout stuff and then they started saying i was staring at the boy when id only glance at him. Then it became constant looking through instas of the past boys to imagine bad ass scenarios in my head with them in it like idk making out or doing a concert infront of them so they could see what they missed.  And i really wanted to join that group of boys(they were a part of the same group) cause i really want a group of male friends so i started imagining stuff with them in like going out doing stuff. So like now i still do the insta for the pics to imagine scenarios with them in or whenever a girl they know does a tag on insta id check if the boys were tagged in it or i check comments of other instas to see if they have said any comments like about their appearance and i get jealous if they have or if a girl has on theres even though i only speak to like 2 of them from the group. Its like im jealous that girls are friends with them because i want to be friends with them or start a relationship. Now i keep imagining stuff and ideas to like be in their area where they live so i can bump into them and like start talking and make friends or sit where they go out in the streets and chill or walk by them in their area like just be there in there spot or close by. Like 3 times ive messaged the boys who stopped talking to me saying why did u do it or whats ur issue hoping we will make up but nope. And once i pretended to accidentally send a snap to one of them so i could start a convo with them. And like now i even look up peoples facebooks and instas still to look at the pics then imagine cool scenarios where they fall for me or some stuff like that whilst i got music in. Like i do this for alot of people(boys). Im worried its like obsession and im gonna be some insane girl whos obsessed and will kill if anyone gets in my way(its unrealistic but i still worry). And now im sat worrying omfg my parents have raised a psychopath and stalker. I know i need to get over them and stop the insta thing. This is reallyIm 16 female.

235,"You'd think my mood would be consistently bad in such a situation. But actually it's in waves. Most of the time I do feel like shit but sometimes I listen to some epic music and have a motivating talk with someone and suddenly feel like I'm on top of the world and all this can be fixed.

Why does my brain still try to have mood swings in such a hopeless situation? I'd honestly prefer if I didn't have them because when I wake up the next day and it's gone away, it's even more crushing to return to reality.

The situation is unfixable. There's pretty much no way out of this country anytime soon. My health is really fucked because of obesity and I can't even get access to meat because my family is strictly vegetarian and won't let me have it so even getting fit is out the window without access to lean protein. And even if I manage to escape my family and this country, the trauma of living here will be permanent and will fuck with me forever (I doubt I'll ever make enough to be able to afford something as prohibitively expensive as therapy)

So, in short, I have no hope. I should just resign to my fate and just like hope to die by getting hit by a truck or something as soon as possible.

So why won't my brain just accept the futility of the situation and sit down and shut the fuck up rather than constructing elaborate fantasy scenarios where by extreme chance and unbelievable miracles I could make it out of here and fix my life and everything. I'm realistic and I can call a spade a spade. Why can't I shut up this irrationally optimistic part of my brain that can't do that and just hurts me by giving me fleeting false hopes?",31Jul2020,1

237,"I sought an escape from what was on my mind, in my surroundings. 

I sought an escape and eventually, I became numb for it. I rewired my mind to it. After time, I forgot why I sought an escape and now needed an escape from the escape. 

My escape was porn, alcohol, drugs, and anything that could distract from my problems only temporarily because nothing lasts forever and peace cannot be obtained easily and without action. 

I have been down roads many times before, I have turned around and I have relapsed to the same path. 

I am currently numb from my escape. My surroundings seem less and less like what I knew before, and I can feel myself becoming an object of my mind. Everything and nothing feels the same. 

____

Writing and reflection are some of the most apparent actions that can bring me back. Writing in the dark, thoughts attached to a numbing body and questioned soul. 

I become numb physically as well as mentally. I forget where I am in my goals. I forget what I could be doing instead of seeking an escape. I forget progress, and I hate myself for it. I punish myself because it has been so long since I have achieved progress. I seek an escape then, too. Time passes, and I seek an escape from that escape and it keeps ongoing. 

I see people on the street, friends close by, folks on tv. Someone interesting you meet. I am that person often, but not always. Everyone has faults. I have many. Some have more. Some create them for themselves and others solve them seemingly effortlessly.  

I didn't use to think my mental health was a talking point, but that was before all the impermanent durations of escape. 

I moved away at one point in my life to start over fresh. I made friends and I believe I was viewed as normal. Time passed and I sought escape. I sought escape so much that I turned into a new version of myself. It became a talking point in some aspects. Granted, it was a tough situation regardless of escape. I made friends that after time, our relationship was questioned. I made sure that people knew me well, and I don't know if I knew them in the same. I talked to people and sought people to talk about my escapes. 

The new place which I had moved to, turned into the same place from which I sought to escape. Bad relations, boredom, and the like. I moved away from it. I thought I just had a bad start. The problem was me. 

My problems are so deep-rooted, as many of ours are, to childhood, that I struggle to define them, and they only appear in the cracks of self-hatred.

I know the ways I can improve. Meditation, reflection, ""healthy eating."" I know the necessary points that we all need. Human interaction. Our views change by others and with the environment. I just don't seek these out as often as I do escapes.

I've suppressed most of the memories but one just won't go away and I'm wondering if this experience might be the cause of many problems I have today, and if this might be ptsd. I'm asking you because I don't want to bother my therapist with it just in case I'm just being over dramatic and making a bigger deal out of it then I should.

I that you can get ptsd from childhood abuse but I don't know if this counts.
if you know could you tell me?

To understand this story you'll probably need some context of how the classroom worked and few other things.

In the class there is this chart with each students name on a clip, if you do something she deems bad then you have to move you clip down the chart, each day you started at the top and if you got to the bottom I think she called your parents (I can't exactly remember).
Now the teacher never really liked me, I was never sure why, I think it was because I never referred to her by her name and always just called her ""The Teacher"" or just ""Teacher"" if talking directly to her, I wasn't comfortable calling her by name, I don't know why, I assume its due to maybe having autism. My parents never got me diagnosed because if I was autistic then I was high functioning and they thought I'd be fine.
Anyway, she didn't like me, maybe it's the name thing or maybe she could tell I was a bit different than most of the other kids, but I knew how she felt about me and it hurt, I constantly would seek her approval, I would do my best on the work assigned, I would do things she asked a soon as I could and did my best to listen to her (which was very difficult for me because of my ADHD) but nothing I did was ever good enough. whenever she interacted with parents or other teachers she would be super kind but with only us she would show her true colors, the only times she was nice was when another adult was in the room.
I have diagnosed Generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, and ocd, I also get some sort of weird panic attack thing that my therapist and my former therapist couldn't specifically identify, they both referred to it as a sort of ""cousin"" to a panic attack.
I think that's all the context you need, if you still need more just ask and I'll do my best to answer.

Okay, so now with the story of why I think I might have ptsd.
It was some sort of circle time so everyone was sitting on the carpet in front of the teacher, I was quietly talking to the kid next to me (probably my best friend at the time), I don't now what we were saying but it was something short like a question or a comment about something, I can't remember who instigated the conversation (if you could even call it that) but I was the only one who got in trouble, she got mad and scolded me for talking and told me to move my name down. Everyone was staring at me wide eyed, I timidly got up sobbing and doing that gaspy hiccopy thing kids do when they're crying a lot, I'm slowly walked to the chart, looking back at everyone staring at me, she kept repeatedly telling me stop crying and just move my name down, I was trying to tell her it wasn't just me talking but I was crying to much and was to scared to say much anything, so I just cried harder. I stood in front of the chart crying trying to get my self to move my clip but it felt like my body wouldn't let me, I looked back at everyone staring at me in silence while she continued to berate me, I eventually got my name down and some more scolding happened for me taking so long and ""making a big fuss over it"", It was humiliating and terrifying, that moment felt like it lasted forever.

Needless to say I HATED her from then on, i felt like I needed to prove to her that I was a good person and I could behave, I felt I need to prove to her to prove to myself that I'm good... I felt like this up until I was in 7th grade, over a year after I graduated from that school. I noticed that after that moment I became more reserved and quiet, I kept to myself and rarely interacted with others unless it was at recess with someone I considered close, I did whatever I could to be accepted by my peers (including things I'm not proud of). Eventually when I was in 4th or 5th grade I gave up trying to fit in with my peers and did everything on my own. They treated me like I was much younger than them because I was reclusive and quiet, I hated it, but said nothing...
She'd also insult me when ever I answered a question wrong, I can't remember exactly what she'd say but it was something along the lines of ""No, that's wrong, you'd know this if you'd pay attention."" she'd get mad at me when ever I forgot my login of password to the educational sights (I have problems remembering passwords,logins, faces, names, dates, ect).
Out of all the time I spent in that class I an only recall one positive interaction with her. we were learning about patterns, we used these little colored blocks to make our own patterns (I'll try to find a picture of the blocks) I made a really long one that's pattern repeated twice two directions (I'll make a diagram),  she came over to check our patterns and when she got to me she saw it and surprisingly seemed sort of impressed, she used it as an example to the class and said something like ""even though this doesn't look like a pattern it is...) and did some more explaining, I was very proud that I was able to get her approval, I thought ""if it happened once it could happen again"" (it didn't).
I was also bullied by this boy, my friends would always stick up for me when they could but me and the boy went to the same after care and my friends didn't so the bullying continued, the after care wasn't a good place either... the caretakers never punished real bullies but would punish you if you retaliated and if you did anything even remotely inappropriate like saying ""butt"" or ""wee wee"" or something like that.

I have many other unpleasant experiences but the the post would be too long, I also don't think they contribute to the point of why I made this post.

So do you think I have ptsd from my experience in kindergarten, and if so, then how should I bring it up with my therapist?",31Jul2020,1

246,"I couldn’t meet my goals that I set for myself because they were too high which led to me feeling worse about myself and useless at some point. Eventually, I stopped doing anything because I felt like there was not a single reason to keep trying if I just keep on disappointing myself. It got to a point that I am unable to sleep properly. I sleep longer than usual (before 7 hours, now about 12-14) and I have dreams that stress me. I wake up stressed, scared and the worst of all - tired, so doing anything to make myself feel better is becoming harder and harder. And I really want to do something because I know that as long as I am in that state I just waste time.

253,"How do we continue on past sharing too much of our core 

Who to tell everything to? Everything being how we are. Not lying in saying how we want people to view we are (such as saying I'm good just because someone asks).

Is it better to just have a therapist- someone who in the 99% won't judge you or leave you since you're paying them? 

If we tell our friends every problem and dark thought we have or that we didn't know we had, most often times they don't know what to say beyond the countless things they already have. They don't how else to help you when you're facing the same problems over and over to no avail. 

Should we choose someone new each time to vent to? 

A dilemma. We don't want to hangout with people that know everything about us because theres no fun in worrying. 

Its hard to enjoy when you feel like you're being judged or worried about even though at one moment you may feel fine and you told them about another where you didn't and they perceive you as that one moment instead of where you might feel fine. 

Am I being superstitious? 

I've made friendly relationships and I've ruined them by asking for help too many times and where they don't ask back because they're not suffering or they don't feel comfortable talking me, it becomes one sided and awkward. 


Sometimes I overshare intentionally because I just want problems to go away  and it's better to have someone know than struggle with it by yourself.

To the friends I've told my problems to, they will view me by my descriptions of what I've faced and in a time where im doing better they will remember and it will become awkward. 

You become the person who can act like they have everything together, only the one person you told your problems and secrets to is at that one social function you're attending all week. It turns sour. Inescapable. What are we to do.

Should i just get a therapist?

My problems arent always. They come and go. Sometimes it's bad and other times its fine. Normal. 

Sometimes I've isolated so long that I don't think straight and don't know the full extent of what I'm saying or that I don't realize in the moment that the implications of my actions are. 

I have good intent for the most part. I hate myself when things go awry because I didn't see it. And sometimes I do see it and I do it anyways. 

Therapists are expensive. I'd be better for it or it might make no difference. How do I know I'm not self sabotaging myself or blowing problems out of proportion?

It of course feels like self sabotage in all cases since everyone is so defensive, who do I have to blame but myself? My response, my innate and unassuming actions, my isolationistic behavior. 

I blame myself maybe too much. It all seems so bleak right now and I'm not even thinking about death or dying since it feels like I'm not even living right now.

258,"Hi,

This may not be the right subreddit to post to, but I don't know where else to put it. 

So I've just had the worst July, or worst month in my life in general so far. The events have taken such a toll on me that I just feel helpless, lonely and I'm struggling to see the bright sides anymore.

Please, don't hold this against me for sharing here. I feel like if I mention any of this to my friends, they'll just block me because they all have their own issues and I'm trying to be their emotional support for it all. But those things have been eating at me from the inside and maybe getting opinions from people who are not in any way involved with me will help on gaining perspective. I feel like my friends are only saying all the amazing things about me because they think they have to (while I appreciate and love them for it, I know they're biased).

While July has been the absolute worst, some events had a build up from way before this. And I'll go by chronological happening.

1. Due to Covid and companies making low profits, my team in the company got scrapped. Which left me with the options to 1. take a hefty pay cut and do a job I was way too overqualified for, pay cut that would barely cover my bills if I ate like a 2 year old. 2. Hope for the best they can give me a similar role in the company - with a pay cut. Again, barely enough to pay bills but would allow to eat a bit more. Or 3. find a completely new job. - So I found a new job that I'm starting in 2 weeks. But the stress and anxiety are hitting me hard about this. My best friend says ""Why are you stressed, you fixed the situation by getting a new job with same pay. Nothing to stress over anymore"" **but the feeling of anxiety and worthlessness is still there especially since the ew job is same pay but not what I worked towards for the past 3 years, it's a step back on tasks and responsibilities. And I worked really hard to be good at what I did in the company I'm leaving because I liked it. Wasn't my dream job but I enjoyed it as it took me out of my comfort zone a lot and opened me up to random, short term interactions.**
2. Before lockdown hit my country, I met this guy on Bumble. We chatted and wanted to meet but the lockdown hit and we ended up in a textationship for 4 months. Honestly, I think the conversation was exactly what kept me from going insanely lonely with WFH and living by myself. Having to resort to 1 daily call with my team compared to when we used to go out for lunches together or when I just went over to the car park or other office to chat to people. Suddenly, all these social interactions went away, and I was left alone. So having someone who I would text with daily about anything and everything helped me immensely. We flirted, sent some spicier messages, etc. We even expressed interest in keeping things going beyond only one date - which is why I decided to open up emotionally to the possibility. Lockdown ends and we meet for our first date. Time flew. He came to mine, we started talking (mainly him, we both are chatty but he has just so may interesting things to say I just wanted to listen all the time), and it was suddenly 5 hours later. He ended up staying the night as he missed his last train back home. Yes - we had sex. It was not originally planned for but it became a mutual decision and possibility after we noticed our conversations getting more 18+ rated over time. While I thought that I do like him and we shared almost exactly same goals and values, we both don't want children, we both like similar books and games, similar idea of how a relationship should be. He said he didn't feel the spark and that was it. Just like that. As if the 4 or 5 months of texting and getting to know each other never happened. The person I opened up to after my last relationship 2 years ago, the person I let my guard down for for the first time since then, has broken my trust. And I'm left feeling lonely and as if I am not enough for anyone. While I know I don't look like a model, I am working on myself. I've been losing weight consistently over the past 6 months (I just didn't feel like telling him about this), and I still have weight to lose. So this whole situation of us having sex and him saying afterwards there was no ""spark"" just left me even more insecure than I was before. And I've been trying my best to be confident in my own skin. But being the anxious type, it's hella difficult to deal with if everyone in the past has broken my trust one way or another. There probably were other reasons he wasn't into me as much as he thought he would be, but looks are the only thing that I can think of. **I'm now trying to move on from him - which probably is the best thing even if he said he likes talking to me and wants to remain friends. But it has left me feeling lonelier than before and I am getting absolutely exhausted having to be strong for myself at all times.**
3. Well, this one scenario did it for me and is the drive for this wall of text and is connected to point #2. I've had to leave my MTB outside for the night as my landlord was fixing something in the flat and it was going to take 2 days. I chained the bike right in frot of my door, literally a step outside. In the morning I checked the bike and found that the handlebar was removed and stolen, and my cables for gears and brakes were cut. Not just cut, parts of cables were removed. Nothing else was taken. I did call the police to file a report and now I have to wait for the local police to get back to me about this, maybe a camera on the street somewhere caught something. But it has left me without one of my favourite hobbies that was the only successful one at keeping my mind occupied and giving me the cardio I needed to not worry. **The connection here to #2 is that once again, I had to calm myself down ad collect myself and deal with the situation. And I think this has exhausted me emotionally because I just feel like I'm all alone with any issue I am having and they only seem to be piling up even more.**
4. I am getting tired from pretending I am happy, but each time I express my unhappiness or that something isn't quite right, people move away from me or change subject. So I'm constantly answering with ""I'm fine."", ""I'm good!"", ""I'm alright."". All are lies. I feel like I'm dying inside but have to pretend I'm not because each time I did, I lost friends or they turned on me until I was better. I know those people shouldn't be considered friends, and they're not. But this made me anxious that if I do it with my current friends, they'll do the same. And I'm projecting same fears on guys I'm talking to or going on dates with. I'm also the only single one of the group and they all tell me to get out there and to find someone out of online dating. I'm introverted, I don't like bars and pubs and we were under lockdown for about 5 months. A for effort on that advice.

This whole month I've been crying myself to sleep at night, not sleeping, barely eating. I think today was the first day in 2 weeks I've actually eaten enough calories not to be tired to take a nap or have to wear my winter clothes while everyone walks around in tshirts. Since I'm on a weight loss, I track what I eat meticulously and I've been literally eating less than a 5 year old needs because my stomach is just so tied I feel nauseous just thinking about or smelling food. 

Am I overreacting about everything? Am I being the dumb one for being this emotional about everything? Should I really consider therapy?

Anyone on a weight loss who dated while losing weight? Did you tell your dates about the journey? I feel this is such a personal thing, I don't know if sharing it early on is wise. And my photos (while they don't show all imperfections) aren't showing me in a light that would make me seem different than I am IRL.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR:

1. Lost job, anxiety for starting new one. Feeling inadequate because can't find job in field and have to downgrade.
2. Opened up to a guy online during lockdown to be friendzoned for no spark even though we talked about being almost certain we both are into each other, and having sex on the date.
3. I love cycling and MTB'ing and my bike got vandalised.
4. Anxious about losing friends if I open up to them sice that is a recurring theme in all my friendships.",31Jul2020,1

260,"Updated version because I posted this a while ago.

I will try to keep this short because I am aware that this is a super complicated issue.


I'll start with the basics.


I struggle with loneliness and had struggled with it for a very long time.

I also struggle with mental issues but I luckily have a psychology degree and go through therapy and I have pretty much whatever strategy I can think of and the determination to keep myself afloat even though it is not easy.


I do admit that I am not very adept when it comes to social skills, mostly because of poor upbringing and trauma. 
But I have been learning on the know-how bit by bit and most of the time, I had to learn them the hard way - heartbreaks, rejections, ghosting, you name it.


At first, I thought that the fault was me because I had been rejected, neglected and bullied and abused all my life that the only reasoning that I could think of is that I am the problem.

Truth to be told, there is some truth to that because I know that I am not always sure how to approach another person, let alone not knowing the millions of ways that the person might react.

But I kept on pushing through and realised that the problem was not me but the other person because they do not have the stomach to be open or geniune.

Yet, I persist and persist and persist.

But .... it hurts. A lot.

I feel that people have no gratitude or dignity at all and I feel that the social media that we rely on today makes this bullying too easy.
Funny how we are supposed to feel connected with the technology of today but in reality, it pushes us away and alienates us and pick and toy with each other like toys or stuff we buy in a store room based on what we see on a profile and throw it away when we do not need it anymore.

Too many times, I have tried and tried and tried again to approach other people on social media. I use Instagram to post photos (i like photography) and approach others whenever i see a good photo and 80% of the time, they give only a seen or simply a like and a gentle thank you which I know that it means that they do not want to talk.

I have used dating apps (mostly Tinder) and no matter what approach I use, whether the genuine hello or the creative approach, 70% of the time we get no reply at all.

Or the worst part is when you think you are going so well, the communication feels genuine and real and all of a sudden ... the other person disappears.

It hurts so bad when that happens and it makes me paranoid and scared of what to say next.


Sometimes I ended up double texting just to see if everything is ok.

Sometimes I simply gave an honest message (yes, I am that kind of person. I refuse to simply walk away from something without being deserved an explanation or at least speaking from the heart about how I feel or to genuinely ask if everything is all right). This is the part where I mostly get blocked or still get a seen and no reply.

Sometimes I ended up cancelling my Tinder account but ended up restarting it, hoping for another try. And again, again and again.


This perpetual cycle of me trying to best that I can to have a decent human connection is tiring and has a lot of effect on my entire soul, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.



Too many times I felt less than human because of this when I try to approach myself in the most genuine way possible and treat the other person as an equal.


It is like a really twisted game of chess. Interacting with another human being has become the same as walking on eggshells where you are worried about every move you make because you do not want to risk a bad outcome

Most days, when I feel continuously alone, depressed and hopeless, as much as I have my own strategies to counter these, I feel tempted to look on my phone, aimlessly scrolling or waiting, hoping to get a notification or something.

Too many times I feel like I am being the instigator of a conversation and not the other way around.

I do the best I can to not appear needy or desperate or creepy yet in these situations where things feel so bad, that I have every compulsion to be needy and desperate which I know pushes people away.


So this is where I stand most of the time.


In many cases, it feels like I am going around in circles or stuck in a complicated maze where every path is an elaborate puzzle that needs to be solved.

If I approach myself in a non-genuine way, I might risk being rejected for it

If I approach myself as honest and genuine (which is the approach that I use), people can still potentially reject me because not everyone has the courage to do the same.


Be funny. Be genuine. Be open-minded. Be whatever ... you still get rejected, ghosted or blocked for whatever reason that the other person can think of but never have the stomach to tell you why.

It feels a lot like I am being bullied yet I keep coming back, hoping to try again and hoping to achieve a decent and genuine human connection.

It is exhausting really. 

It is laughable too on how we are in this position and we are the ones who put ourselves in this situation.

 I keep doing my best to avoid doing the same thing or fall the same trap. I don't want to ghost others if I do not feel a connection but I aim to walk away or walk our own paths in good terms. I aim to be honest, genuine and sincere. Still, for some reason, people can reject you for it.


It makes you feel petty, little, embarrassed, voiceless and really frustrated but you do not know why to whom you want to be frustrated to.

It is a heavy burden to carry and a big toll for the sake of genuinely wanting a decent human connection, whether friendship or possibly a relationship of whatever kind.

I can potentially talk about a hundred of other things that I had to endure over the years all because I do not want to feel invisible (and yes, I am aware that loneliness is also in my head. I try to keep that in mind).

I feel that most people are not appreciative of how much effort it takes to just feel like you are treated like a human being, no matter how geniune you try to be.

It feels like you are being treated like a toy or a device that a person can simply manipulate and use and throw away when you dont need it anymore instead of a thing that actually has a soul.

I know that chances are that I could be doing the same to others and probably am not aware of it but I try to keep an open mind to avoid doing the same even though the rest of the world probably does this a lot.

262,"Hey! Using a throwaway for anonymity. Sorry if this is the wrong place for this. So basically I’m 17F and need some advice. Background: no official mental illness. I’ve been through the diagnosis stage of Aspergers and Autism around 4-5 years ago, but I decided to drop out before I received a diagnosis. I don’t know exactly why. I think I was scared mostly, but I was also in a pretty good place where anything I was experiencing I was dealing with pretty well. Last year I started 6th form and from the end of year 11 I started to not deal with whatever I was feeling as well. The main problems arose December last year, as my extremely tight friendship group started to crumble a little. 2 people were clearly toxic and we cut them off, among other troubles as people made their own path post-secondary school. I was really down during this time, with little motivation, work ethic or enjoyment. It really sucked. We’re mostly a pretty good group though and I have a good support network, we just have to work a different dynamic. Change and growing up for me has always been difficult, and a lot of this is happening right now. With University applications, my friends being typical teens (tattoos, alcohol, all the rest of it without drugs), and uncertainty, I feel overwhelmed.

We have a party scheduled for this Sunday (small and within the Coronavirus laws of our country. The only illegal thing is underage drinking) which I was highly excited for. Now I’m highly nervous and feeling super anxious, which is something I’ve noticed is happening more often when social events are arranged. I’ve never been like this before. I’m trying to do what I usually do for stress relief and calming myself down, as well as reassuring myself, but I feel really down about it all.

269,"It’s been a long week, and I haven’t gotten much sleep and my appetite is practically non existent, I want to eat, but I don’t want to. Just like with my insomnia (I get tired but can’t sleep) I get hungry but don’t want to eat. I force myself too but I still don’t want to, I probably eat 900-1200 calories a day.

Up until now I have been an emotional eater, I weight 290lbs and eat whenever I’m emotional or anxious. I don’t know why this is a sudden change but it’s happened. As for my sleep, I typically don’t get good sleep, I typically have trouble falling asleep, but once I do I get 4-6 hours. But recently, I get 4 and wake up a dozen times through the night. Mumbling something to myself or just wanting to cry. 

The other issue that has been slowly coming on for weeks but hadn’t hit me in my entirety until yesterday is a scary one. I forget I’m me, and when I look down at my body or my arms and legs, sometimes I need to remind myself that I’m me. The other thing that goes with this is when I look in the mirror, I have crushing anxiety. I have always hated myself, and disliked my physical appearance, and everything else about myself. But up until now I have never had issues looking at myself in the mirror, recently I have been acting like my father (look like him too, have changed my appearance so I don’t resemble him as much) and I think maybe that connects. 

I was undergoing crazy anxiety and stress, and it disappeared overnight, I don’t know what changed, but i still have this feeling that somethings not right.
Seriously overnight everything changed, I didn’t have some “insightful” thought, or an eye opening breakthrough, just everything vanished. I’m not happy, but I’m not sad, I’m not on any drugs anymore (haven’t been for over a month). I don’t know what to do, or if there is anything I really can do other than seek professional mental help, which I am.

Idk if there is any advice for my situation, but even just sharing a similar situation or some insight would be greatly appreciated.",31Jul2020,1
270,"My 23 year old brother is suicidal and having violent thoughts. I live together with him, my mom and my moms alcoholic boyfriend. It's a very surreal living situation where if my moms boyfriend dinks something all hell breaks loose and everyone is on edge, locking their doors and so on. 

It's his house and we moved in with him because we were about to get evicted from our old home. ever since we moved in my brother has expressed his wish to die before 30 and always checks when the next train leaves just in case he feels he needs to do it. he has also developed an alcohol and weed addiction.

He often says he just wants to stab my moms boyfriend or anyone really. he is expressing very egotistical behaviour, blaming a lot of things on my mom and me. he doesn't care about many people and says he wouldn't care if our mom died, even by his own hands. I think he believes that he has all the knowledge about live and not acknowledging the live experience of other people. He has developed sympathy with mass murderers and agrees with them on a lot of things.

He thinks he alone has the worst live ever and doesnt't understand that other people who have more experience and ""worse"" problems exist.

I tried talking him into therapy but he insists no one can understand him and to be honest he has been trying to bring his belives onto me as well. telling me to maybe go through with ""it"" together.

I think the catalyst of it all is our current living situation we have tried looking for a new home but me and my mom only make about 2000 euros plus she is heavily in debt so finding a new home is very difficult.

I made this post because I'm currently sitting in the kitchen between my brother and my mother fighting and i needed some distraction. thats it really.",31Jul2020,1
271,"I had a therapist that I was seeing regularly who I did enjoy seeing. When we talked, she helped be make some pretty grand connections that I haven’t realized otherwise - for example my tendency to gravitate towards men who didn’t handle things well emotionally after growing up with a father who was emotionally manipulating. 

However, after being led to these realizations I couldn’t help but feel a bit lost. It was as if i felt grateful to recognize it but i felt i wasn’t told or taught any tools to help me go about actually materializing some type of change in my life to avoid repeating those behaviors. I started thinking deeper about what i would want as a fulfilling therapeutic experience for me and i feel that longer term issues like the ones i feel i suffer with (selfworth and esteem issues/ anxiety and depression/ lack of motivation etc) require an interactive experience between both parties. I would like to come to these realizations yes but also a plan of action regarding how to go about managing those behaviors. 

So i guess my question for y’all is has anyone experienced therapy like this or is it not the nature of the industry? Has anyone had an experience where they left a therapist or therapy feeling more empowered about going through life and if so what made that experience for you?",31Jul2020,1

I had a question regarding something that has been becoming more and more prominent as I get older. It's almost as though I 'hear voices'? Like, I'm pretty sure they're coming from my mind, but I can't always recognize 'who' it is - if that makes sense? 

For example, I tried to meditate earlier today, and it happened. I could hear a disembodied whisper in my head that also felt omnipresent? And then other 'voices' joined, too, with like screaming and yelling? It honestly is so upsetting and distressing. Other times distressing visuals will flash in my head along with these 'voices'.

It is likely that I have anxiety and depression, and my mother has been diagnosed with OCD. Could it be related to these mental illnesses, or something else? 

I know I can't get a proper diagnoses on the internet, but if anyone has any insight it would be greatly appreciated. ❤",31Jul2020,1

277,"Hey all, so, quick run down I’m not the type of person to have a bunch of half assed friendships. When I go into a friendship I go all out, tell each other everything, you’d easily mistake us for dating kinda friendship. 

As a result I only have two close friends who I would do anything for, as well as a kind and loving partner who recognises how I am and doesnt mind if I spend all my time with them as long as I’m home most nights, and spend some time alone with him. 

One of my friends I’ve known for years, and I’m incredibly relaxed and I don’t get much in the way of anxious feelings about it. I know they are there for the long hall and we are stuck with each other. 

My other friend is more recent, knew each over via internet for a few years but over the last six months or so have gotten incredibly close. 

This friendship has me worried about being dropped, or left behind, and basically an anxious paranoid mess, unhealthily attached. This is a stage that I go through with everyone I can see being in my life for the rest of it. But it normally doesn’t take this long before I feel comfortable in the friendship. 

The main reaction is anxiety when I don’t hear from them for a period of time. It’s much better and I can now go hours and feel fine. The problem comes when unexpected distances happen and I start to freak out and make sure they haven’t deleted me from Facebook or blocked me. This often leads me to feeling really hazy and moody. 

I also think there is a feeling of loneliness going on, alongside the feeling of excitement that comes alongside a new friendship and the joy of getting to know another person. 

I know where it comes from and it’s a result of many friends and people I’ve cared deeply for dropping me and leaving me behind. But the problem is I see this friend multiple times a week so I have absolutely no reason to feel this way, or to feel like any of this is going to happen as I’ve seen no evidence outside of love and affection.

283," This time last year, I broke up with my only long-term partner. I had given 200% in the relationship and failed to set boundaries. I asked her to move in with me in the hope that it would encourage her to mature and grow more independent, but that didn't happen. I realised that she just wasn't going to grow up, and was not the right partner for me. My instinct knew that early on, but it was like I was trying to deny the reality because ""this time, my relationship will work"".

I feel like I've dated a lot - around 15 people in the last five years - including first dates. I know a lot of people date two people a week, but that's never been my cup of tea. I always date exclusively, I like to decide early on if I'm going to see someone, and stop looking for others until I decide whether I want to keep seeing that person. I guess I'm just old-fashioned, but I have strong values and believe in respecting the person I am seeing and communicating clearly and honestly. My attitudes have changed at times and sometimes I've tried to be someone I'm not, but I like to think I have grown and matured. For me personally, 15 is a lot. I feel like I have ""dating fatigue"".

After my breakup, I dated a couple of women, both slightly older. I used Hinge for the first time which I found to be much better than Bumble, Tinder etc as the women on there seemed to be grown-ups who were more likely to want something serious. I had a couple of dates with one lady who then had to move long distance for work. The second lady I suddenly found myself acting strongly out of character. She was also fresh out of a complex relationship and I think we both felt self-destructive. We skipped a few stages. We didn't take precautions. That isn't how I was raised, and I felt ashamed. I decided to delete the apps and take a year to pull my shit together.

Two months into quarantine, I found the situation hard, and quite by accident I started an online connection with someone, long distance. It was a fantasy and it was never going to work. Again, I feel like I made poor choices. I am embarrassed.

In every other area of my life - apart from romance - I am extremely self-disciplined, driven and together. I have a very successful career, have excellent financial planning, and a small but close circle of great friends and family. I volunteer, and in addition to my full-time job, I am studying in night school for a full-time degree. In term time my weekly commitments are about 50+ hours, but that's easily manageable being single and living in walking distance of everywhere I need to be.

Without going off topic, a couple of weeks ago I found out that my mother (whom I have been estranged from for over 10 years) has terminal cancer, and will be dead by Christmas. I have started seeing a therapist, as I believe strongly in counselling (the subject of my degree) and it has been immeasurably helpful before. This week I spoke about my relationship history, and how again I suddenly feel this pull towards wanting to find a romantic partner. It doesn't take a shrink to now I am unhealthily seeking comfort and again likely to make bad choices. I am far from in the right mindset to get back out on the dating scene.

I know consciously what I need to do (or rather not do), and I can diagnose the reasons why I feel this way. I know I am self-critical and put a massive amount of pressure on myself in everything I do. I am an intelligent, logical, strong individual who is good at dealing with facts and plans, and I am an empathetic and genuine listener/advocate for people who need my help. What I am not good at dealing with however, is my own feelings. And that's why I'm writing this down, as an outlet.

This sucks. I crave the intimacy of a relationship where I can take my armour off and be vulnerable. I equate that with sex and girls. The eye contact, the kissing, the warmth of being naked with someone, the joy of making someone feel good and feeling safe with them. I hate this. I feel weak, and that I can't trust my own judgement.

285,"Recently I’ve been experiencing difficulty when expressing my emotions. I’m not sure what’s triggered it, but I used to be very expressive with my emotions, if I thought something was gross, then my body would tell me it’s gross and I’d feel disgusted by it, but not much anymore. If I found something funny then I’d laugh or smile, but, yet again, not so much anymore. I could go on but you get the gist. I just don’t really feel anything anymore, besides things that bring along a negative stigma, such as boredom, irritation, or unhappiness, of which I can express very well. My family have had a large level of mental health issues, due to us all having a rough upbringing between two parents who had a rough divorce which we heard constantly, and one of them who abused us, who would buy certain things like cigarettes over essentials, such as food or toiletries. But we now live with a parent who took good care of us, but we only see him on the weekends due to his work, but also he seems to prioritise his new girlfriend over us, who we have began to dislike somewhat due to this, which has caused him to prefer her over us even more from our point of view. Essentially leaving me to grow up almost by myself, due to my other siblings being older than me and having work. I basically have the house to myself almost every day, and it has its pros and cons. Although I’m not sure if that has anything to due with what I’m experiencing.

I am currently in year 10 for school ( I’m 15, and will be going into year 11 in September, where I’ll turn 16 not long after starting again), and in year 8 and 9 I had a long experience with, what I think was depression, I hated school, I hated my home life cause I was never given a break in either, and every day I thought about ending my life, thinking that it was inevitable because it was getting worse and worse and I thought I’d end up killing myself at some point anyway, so I might as well get it over with. Though I was very close to it at certain times, with my mind split and me having to contact friends to talk me out of it, I’m glad that I am still alive right now. 

I’m not sure if anything I’ve just said helps out with what I’m dealing with, but might as well include it if it is of any help to what I might have, and I’ll probably see a doctor about it soon anyway. But if anyone knows what I might be experiencing please let me know, I really don’t know why I don’t feel certain emotions as much as I used to and it’s rather concerning to me.

i don’t expect any diagnoses as i don’t think that’s something you can really give out over the internet - but i’m stuck. this may be long. i’m not sure what i’m about to write but i just don’t think this is normal - and would love some advice on coping, or whether this is something to see a doctor over - and if it is, what exactly i say to the doctor? 

i was lead here finally by my need to constantly. check. things. every small pimple / mark that appears on my skin i am googling types of skin cancer for hours. every time i get a new tattoo / acrylic nails / eyelash extensions i am convinced they will become infected  (infections are my biggest fear?) and will google the certain infections for hours. any kind of illness symptoms and i am trying to work out what deadly illness is trying to kill me off. i put my phone down to do something, immediately feel sick and have to check through all of my social media / phone log / text messages to make sure i haven’t accidentally sent somebody something (this happens the most often). despite knowing when my shift at work starts, checking my rota every few minutes in the hours leading up to the shift. constantly checking i’m not calling someone by accident (i never am). laying in bed at night, near tears, as i have convinced myself i didn’t check the back door at work enough times and i have left it unlocked (it’s always locked). going out, getting halfway to my destination (sometimes reaching my destination) and having to go home / ring somebody to make sure i closed the front door (i always have). i could probably go on - but currently the skin cancer and social media ones are keeping me up, i’m past the point of crying as i know it’s going to 
happen, i just don’t want it to happen anymore. 

sometimes when i have one of these things on my mind i become extremely overwhelmed to the point where no one is allowed to touch me, and if people are speaking  it’s like my brain cannot handle thinking all of these things at 100mph and also comprehend what they’re saying - typically leading to me in tears, or screaming at them. my senses are heightened during these times. a lot of the time actually. i touch my wrists a lot to calm me down, like wrapping my hands around them or rubbing them - but if something is touching my wrist when this isn’t happening it will send me into some kind of sensory overload. i don’t know if this is relevant but it just doesn’t feel normal. 

i come from a family where these things aren’t spoken about and my family have often labelled my behaviour as “weirdo moods” and when i have “one of my fits”, my mum often laughs at me, or gets angry. my best friend has told me that OCD may be the answer. i haven’t been registered at a doctor for years, as as much as i am constantly scared that i have skin cancer, or an infection, or that i’m dying - i am so scared that i am right, that i would rather be ignorant towards whether it’s true or not. should i see a doctor ? or is this normal ? does everyone do this ?  what would i even say, that i’m scared of everything ?",31Jul2020,1
295,"I'm 26 years old. I'll be 27 in a few months. I've realized that I've wasted 9 years of my life; just messing around and being a delusional moron. I've been in and out of school for years. I was constantly switching career paths, like almost every year. When I found something I liked, I'd learn more about the topic, but then quit because I would either get bored or just find it hard as I learned more about it. The subjects I've studied are: Graphic design, marketing/sales, accounting/finance, business admin, IT/web design, HR, and nursing. I eventually decided that school is not my goal in life. I might go back in the future, but I really got to think about this. I've already wasted a lot of money and time.

I was a bartender for years while I was failing in school, but now I'm working as a medical receptionist. So far it's been fine, but there's a lot of stuff I need to know and its kinda making me anxious. The pay is horrible, but it's hard getting a job during these times, so I guess it will have to due. I just hope I can keep up with everyone in the office. I really don't want to lose this job. I think my mom is finally somewhat happy for me, and I don't want to upset her.

I'm also pretty socially awkward even though I was a bartender for years. But I honestly feel like the only reason why my bar customers like me was because they felt bad for me. I also have a hard time focusing and studying; I mean this is probably why I failed a lot of my classes. I also tend to have irrational thoughts. Like I'm constantly putting myself down and I think it's because of this, I'm feeling like a failure already. Yes, I've tried therapy, but it didn't really help me much.

There are days where I just to end it all. I feel like I'm such a fuck up and that there's no reason for me to be alive. The only reason why I haven't killed myself is because I don't want to hurt my family. Like if I didn't have my family with me, I'd be either homeless or living in a really bad place. I know I'm complaining a lot. I know there are people who have it way worse than I do. I'm not blaming anyone for my fuck ups. I know it's 100% my fault. Idk maybe I could've tried harder in school when I was younger. Maybe I would've been a slightly less of a fuck up. I just feel like the dark thoughts are growing in my head. I feel like my family will grow tired of me and finally not care about me. I wouldn't blame them tbh. Like I said, I'm a pain to deal with",31Jul2020,1

I'm sharing it because it helps me and maybe a caring voice would help you, too.",31Jul2020,1
298,"I think it is from anxiety and stress my parents think it is from dehydration, though I drank three litres of water every day for about a week, now it’s down to only 1 litre, though nothing changed. I have been suffering from depression and anxiety since I was about six. It got a lot worse about a year ago, and has been waking me up at 4 in the morning, my headaches started around the same time. Do you think I’m am right or what is going on?",31Jul2020,1
