0,"i think i have schizoid personality disorder. i dont really want close relationships because i have a deep belief that relationships are unfulfilling. however, i think this is honestly the lowest i’ve ever been, and that’s saying something. even as i present this cold, seemingly stable facade to the world, there is a part of me that feels off and broken. i want to feel happiness again. i want to live and love. the desire is not very strong, but i know that is the only way i could ever be truly happy. ive been quite depressed and hopeless lately and i know that a change needs to be made before my state worsens. any tips on how to begin developing a desire for relationships? or to become more vulnerable? (due to covid, i cant go to a psychiatrist just yet. i just need a little bit of hope to get me through the year.)",27Sep2020,1
1,"I just want to tell a story that happened to me a few years back. 

I was about 11 when i texted my cousins in a group-chat what i was going to be for halloween. That’s it, innocent.

Well apparently one of my cousins was going to be the same thing.

This escalated from “you always copy us” to “i will beat you until you are bleeding black and blue i have a knife and i will kill you”

I tried to tell my mom and she called there mom, but they lied. Her mom didn’t believe us and assumed that i had done something wrong.

I remember being so angry and also hating myself. That was the first time i ever felt truly suicidal. At 11.

After months of not talking to each other our entire family split in half with our poor grandma in the middle, they came to our birthday party and we never spoke about it again.

Our birthday party was near halloween so we always had a costume party. 

And i was forced to change my costume and she ended up wearing it. To my birthday party. In front of me.

It became an unspoken thing in the family, now i have constant panic attacks around them and feel suicidal whenever someone brings it up. It sucks cause halloween has always been my favorite holiday too.

It’s been about 4 years since it happened.
I still never forgave them. It’s not like they even apologized anyway.
 

I feel awful too cause they are my family but I have this anger towards them. After the party for the next year i hated them. 


I wish i could get revenge and that sounds horrible but it’s true. Just to put them through the same shit they put me through. 


I currently am 15 and yes i do have severe anxiety and depression but i am doing better without them in my life.

So now i have the problem that i always wake up at night because I'm paranoid that my mum lets him in again, i cant sleep, i cant eat and i cant even move properly..
Today i found out that my mum talked to him on the phone, i don't know what they talked about but I'm so scared, he said he would kill and rape me. I can't even breath rn, idk what to do.. I started having suicidal thoights again, maybe i should kill myself..",27Sep2020,1
3,"As I have progressed throughout my education I have developed more and more of a lack of interest in working my hardest, because after all, what is the point? My worst year so far was my previous year of sixth form, with me getting so anxious and stressed about doing online lessons at the start of lockdown that I just skipped them entirely. Now, starting university, I find myself falling into a similar trap and just trying to avoid as many things as possible and I cannot engage with my work.

What the fuck is wrong with me? I just can’t work hard at all, I see no point in any of it, all I will end up with is a dead end job, wasting away my life anyway, so what is it all even for? I sometimes think maybe I should just end my life and avoid it all completely, and save everyone else the hassle of knowing me, but I feel like this isn’t a good way to look at it.

What can I truly do? I feel a complete lack of control over my own body, I just get told to work and try my hardest but what is any of it even for?",27Sep2020,1
4,"To me, if I won a substantial amount of money, or have a good income source, a lot of my problems would be solved. It might not be the case for anybody but certainly my case material good plays a large role.

You see, I am 22, and for most of my adult time, I was unable to keep a job, the school did not work out for me and I wasn't really into what I was studying in the college, not only got kicked out of college but a community college.  I think it partly was my fault, I did not choose something I like and so that I did not try hard enough and also the teaching method at community college wasn't that good either.   


People say it is bad to live payday to payday, but for me, it is from nothing to nothing! I can't even get a simple job, people say be cashier at Walmart, delivering pizza, work at Macdonald's is an easy job to get but it been hard as a hack for. I always get stuck at previous job reference and school, I have absolutely no people to reference and no degree to speak of.  


I did get a job by pure chance once, where I just put few friends down and the manager just kinda hired me on the spot for a warehouse associate, but I only was able to do it for a month. The job was so repetitive and tiring that my days were only consisting get up, go to work, come home and eat, then sleep and rinse and repeat. That was the time when the COVID just hit, and honestly, I would catch that COVID so I just have a legit reason to take a break. The manager fired me within a month due to the below standard performance. It was a relief that I finally can get out of this hole. People were actually very nice to be there, so I don't want to tell them that I want to leave.   


Often times I think that I am not good enough. People say I am not good at singing, I am not good at drawing, for me, I just think I am not good at life. Honestly, I very very hate leech on my parents.",27Sep2020,1
5,"So basically what it boils down to is that I am a freshman attending college online and it is having a massive negative impact on my mental health. First, during my senior year in high school what I was anticipating most is meeting some new people in college and as COVID stuck around during summer I accepted the fact that this would be very difficult to near impossible while being on campus. I have a very close group of around 6 friends from high school but with half of them being gone I am left alone at night very often. It also does not help that the ones that away keep sharing their experiences of making new relationships with lots of people which makes me jealous and upset.

 Second, the stress of college has also gotten to me the past few weeks. I was the type in high school to never study and still do good so when all of this work hit me I did not know what to make of it. This ended up making me have a panic attack the other night and almost having a complete meltdown (luckily though my buds were home that weekend to help me feel better). This is the first emotional outburst I had in a while, as most of the time my mechanism is repressing bad emotions and locking them away which leads me into my third point.

Third, my repressing of so many negative emotions as of late has left me feeling depersonalized and emotionally hollow. Empty, it is so empty, not sadness or happiness, just empty. I am struggling to feel anything than just straight up existing. Nothing feels fun anymore. I just said goodbye to a friend that was visiting and when she hugged me goodbye I could not muster up any words to tell her how much I love and appreciate her. I just gave her a hollow smile which I feel so bad about because she along with the rest of my small group helps me so much and is basically my livelihood.

\*sigh\*

I miss being my goofy and positive self. I miss human interaction. I miss feeling excited and happy. I just want things to go back to normal.

I do not belive I have the aforementioned mental illnesses and my long term childhood friend who works as a therapist also believes I do not have the the aforementioned mental illnesses.

7,"So a lad a new back in high school has recently become active on Instagram and has started various live streams and posts. 

Something is seriously wrong, without going in to too much detail; he has delusions of grandeur, thinks he’s the reincarnation of various famous people and thinks he’s in telekinetic communication with the queen of England. He’s already lost his drivers license due to driving under the influence and in his most recent video I can hear his girlfriend crying in the background.

Hey friends.  
I am displaced temporarily dude to construction on my house, thus all my animals are as well. Supposedly, one of my cats got out at one of my friends houses. I say supposedly because nobody saw him get out, but after multiple searches of the house from top to bottom, we had fo conclude that he escaped. I’m absolutely gutted, I feel like I failed him because he wouldn’t have been at the house if it wasn’t for me, and my friend didn’t even notice until 2 days after she had last seen him. I have a security camera up as well as an animal trap set up (the kind that traps feral cats and raccoons and stuff), and I spent a bunch of money on flyers and my friend helped me pass them out. My point is, I’ve done everything I can think of for him, but I feel so hopeless. Along with those feelings, I’m dealing with not having been in my house for nearly a month, and I also backed into a car that was parked behind me at night the same day I found out Toodles was missing. To say this month has been hard is an understatement. 
My emotional turmoil comes in with a guy. It sounds so dumb. I’ve been talking to him for about a week, and we just went on our first date. I had a wonderful time. I really like him and he wants to see me again. But I feel so guilty being happy while my kitty is out there somewhere, probably cold and confused and without his brothers and sisters. How can I be happy for myself when a piece of my heart is out there? I want to allow myself to be giddy, but I’m sad and I’m stressed. How can I deal?",27Sep2020,1

It’s been two months, she was admitted to a mental health hospital and diagnosed extreme bipolar. She lacks motivation 90% of the days and can barely function as a human, she has her days where she’s awesome but ever since April it’s been hell.

23,"I've only realised in the last few weeks but it's a cycle I keep repeating again and again.

As I become closer to somebody, I become more ""clingy"". It doesn't only happen with someone I'm romantically interested in, but also with friends.

If they go somewhere or do something without me, I become depressed. I was already going through suicidal depression. So at times like these, I felt even worse. Now that I think about it, some of my suicide attempts took place roughly around the same time I was feeling left behind.

My friend is on an overnight trip with their friends (not mutual friends so I don't know most of them). And yesterday was probably one of the worst days I've had since last year. I kept despairing about being left behind, about not sharing the same experiences, about possibly being compared for similar experiences (like if they go to the beach and then they go to the beach with me too but they'd think the one with me was less fun), thinking they'd rather spend time with other people than with me. They know about my condition and they had made me promise not to attempt anything, but yesterday if I wasn't fighting with every single piece of effort I could muster up, I probably would've jumped from my balcony.

And I've found that I start destroying myself from the inside and try and reach out to other people. But the way I reach out, especially to my friend, is sometimes subconsciously trying to guilt-trip them. Trying to guilt them into not doing what they were going to do. But when I realise that I'm subconsciously guilt-tripping them, I feel guilty myself. I feel ashamed and guilty and feel like I should just die, disappear. And I'm afraid if this continues, they'll really leave me behind because they can't take it anymore. But I can't seem to change this. I think deep down, there's a part of me that believes I shouldn't change this. It's as if deep down I sort of think this is something 'precious' for lack of a better word, something special. And if I lose this, I'd be empty.

I know intellectually that this is wrong, and this is unhealthy. In my attempts to keep people from moving away, I'd just be pushing them further away because of how 'clingy' I am.

Is this a mental disorder? Or are there disorders that are similar? I've been reading up a lot but I can't find anything.",27Sep2020,1
24,"Recently, I've had an experience about an online friendship that didn't end too well. I relied so much on the person for my happiness, cos it's just so much easier this way. I don't get along well with my family, I don't tell them too many things, but I opened up to this person. But now, it's kinda ending, I think. And it's breaking me. This person broke me, made me more sad than I thought I could be.

For the past two weeks, I've been crying almost everyday. My sleep has gotten more horrible than ever, I'm basically tired everyday. My sleep is always so disrupted, I wake up at random times at night, and fall back asleep after a while, and wake up, and back and forth. I'm scared to talk to a doctor, it might sound stupid, but I am. I feel anxious most times, and today, this relationship/friendship just went even worse, and I cried for 3 hours, couldn't breathe much before I finally calmed down.

I'm just so tired, I guess I'm writing this to vent, to get off my chest. I'm really tired.",27Sep2020,1
25,"For context I’m an 18 year old male of it means anything. 

I made a new best friend recently. She’s so supportive and sweet. But my ocd and anxiety from past relationships ruins it for me. 

For the ocd part: I have intrusive thoughts and as well as interpretation issues. I cant really explain it but, for example if someone says something to me that’s a compliment, I know it’s a compliment, but my ocd brain will convince me I’m interpreting wrong and it’ll be something I spend time thinking about for hours. And another example of my compulsions: someone were to text me “i love you” I have to read it over and over again to make sure it truly says that. And for intrusive thoughts I won’t go into it. 

For the anxiety about past relationships: I’ve had people leave me randomly or lose interest in me or stop talking to me and I’m terrified of that happening again. About a month ago I made a new best friend and she ghosted me randomly after 2 weeks when I did absolutely nothing wrong. She still posts and her snap score goes up by hundreds of points everyday. 

Whenever I talk to her I’m always on the verge of tears and I don’t know why. She’s done nothing to me but I’m always terrified something bad will happen. It’s not a personal thing I’m like this with everyone I love talking to",27Sep2020,1

27,"So during high school my mental wellbeing got really low. My boyfriend at the time was depressed and suicidal, I was already trying my best to help him put he kept refusing my help. I started having negative thoughts as well, especially after he attempted, because I kept feeling like I wasn’t good enough. After we broke up I think my mental wellbeing got better but then I threw myself into my school work and extracurriculars. I was working, doing classes, and a ton of extracurriculars to the point I was having 16-hour days. I was a model student with good grades and leadership experiences. But during my final year while I was at work I started having stomach pains and was unable to keep down any food I ate, I had to eat only plain food like oatmeal for nearly 4 months. I also felt really isolated from my friends and family because I was always so busy. I went to a doctor to try to find out what was wrong with me but all my tests came back negative and it eventually went away. 

It was only during university that I started to suspect that my stomach problems may have been induced because of anxiety and stress. I didn’t realize how bad my mental health was in high school until university because I started to become a lot happier. But now halfway through my university experience, I’m starting to struggle with my mental health again. 

While I was still in high school a friend of mine who was studying social work recommended that I go seek professional health, but I never did because I was too embarrassed. Now five years later, I tried contacting professional help for the first time and I’m absolutely traumatized by my experience. I felt like when I was trying to book my call I was being interrogated. I understood that they needed the info from me but I started to get distressed and broke out into tears. I’m a silent crier so I kept going on the call like usual and hoped they wouldnt notice. But then when I was trying to get a date for the appointment I asked the person what their hours were because I work 9-5, and then they continued saying we’re only open during so and so hours (during the daytime), so I asked them to pause and backtrack and told them again that I had work and they responded with “I wish you told me that earlier”. I ended up cancelling booking an appointment. Now I don’t want to ever call again because it already took me a lot of courage built over 5 years to call in the first place. Ever since that call I’ve been breaking out into random crying spells throughout the day.

37 year old guy in the US.  I'm an accountant, and I had my normal tax season stress and anxiety earlier this year, but I haven't really recovered like I normally do.  Since then I've been pretty flat and not looking forward to doing the things I normally find pleasure in.

42,"Ok I don’t mean this as in I feel like I’m dead, I just don’t feel like I am part of my body. Like I get panic attacks when I hear my blood going through my veins at night and when I remember that I have organs and my thoughts are created by a brain I feel weird and disconnected. As a child I assumed I was a robot or something that was just there, not alive or doing anything with any purpose. Didn’t really dawn on me until recently, I’d say the past two years or so, about the age of 16, that I actively started to think about the fact I’m a human who is made of cells and organs. Long before these thoughts I would constantly think about dying and how that “Just couldn’t be me” as if somehow I would keep living and not die. I believe that’s where the “Im a robot” thing came into play. My friends think I’m weird because I constantly talk about how there’s all these bodily processes that keep us alive and I think that’s weird. Ex. I think it makes no sense that we live off of air and we use blood in veins to transport oxygen and etc. through our bodies. When I was younger I hated blood, not like a fear of blood or anything, it didn’t make me sick, I just really hated it, the sight of blood made me uncomfortable but also fascinated me. Like that’s in my body?

43,"Debilitating physical anxiety symptoms

Hi guys. I have many posts on here about my health anxiety and some concerning my physical anxiety but it’s just so bad rn. These symptoms persist even without the presence of anxiety
-weak arms and legs
- clenched jaw and mouth
-mental confusion 
-panic attacks
- tension in neck and head
- mental numbness
-increased anxiety 
-feeling of lump in throat 
All of these symptoms spawned as a result of this big panic attack I had about three weeks ago and my symptoms have not subsided. I had a blood test and everything was good except for my iron and thyroid levels. I have hypothyroidism already so that wasn’t surprising. I keep having this fear that I have a brain tumor or I had/will have a stroke. I haven’t even been able to work because of these symptoms and I don’t know what to do at this point. Can these be caused by anxiety? My endocrinologist checked my reflexes and mental capabilities and concluded that my weakness in my arms and legs are not neurological but I still am terrified. Side note: I’m 17 years old and I started taking lexapro about a week and a half ago, and I have a therapy appointment on Monday.",27Sep2020,1
44,"Hello, I was recently watching this podcast, see link below, time stamp 1:02:08, where one of the guys (Spike) started to explain how he felt about a certain situation.  As he explained it, it blew my mind because I thought I was the only one who ever struggled with this! I guess not!  I want to learn about it further but I don't know what to call it.  I struggle with perfectionism and probably OCD as well, so maybe others can help share if they feel similar or know what to call this!

https://youtu.be/IATlXEx--7M?t=3728

He basically explains that if he personally does a car restoration, at the very end when the car is finished, he actually doesn't really want it, because he knows every single little detail, the 'ins-and-outs', or what had to happen to get to the finished result. 

He also explains how it is like when he goes fishing.  He'll go fishing, but at the end not want to eat his own fish, but rather someone else's.

I kind of suck at explaining it, he does better in the video. 

Also in my personal life, I am a total perfectionist when it comes to working on my car.  Everyone who sees my car usually says 'wow that's really clean, very tasteful, that guy did a superb job modifying his car, etc.' 

But I look at my car and see every little detail, scratch, dent, rusted bolt, wheel damage, etc., done to it. 

I'll take pain staking time to do a job perfect on it, even better than a mechanic might do it.  But at the end it always bugs me.  It's like it's something about my hand, or my imprint I've put on the car, that's somehow not acceptable.   

And then when it's a job I can't do, or don't have time for, I'll bring my car to my mechanic.  I'll drop the car off, pick it up in a couple hours, and won't take a second look at the work my mechanic did.  It won't bother me at all.  Even if he maybe left some grease somewhere, or something is slightly crooked, etc., I won't give it a second thought.

Anyway, does anyone also understand what I am saying?  Maybe you've gone through something similar, or experience this every day??

45,"I don't know if this is something that's been asked/said to death, I have a feeling it might be, so I apologise if it is.

Throughout my whole life, I've owned several different cats. Whenever I feel like I need to cry or I feel like a panic attack might be coming on, if I'm at home, I often go to pet and interact with my cats. I've found it often tends to calm me down quite a bit. It's kinda sad in a way though, it feels like I've only ever really been shown genuine affection from my pets before. Even if I know they're only really nice to me because I feed them, it's nice knowing they'll always be friendly to me, they'll never be pre-occupied with other things or find my emotions inconvenient.

I have quite a few stressful work stuff and family stuff going on, and last night I noticed it looks like I have a little bit more fat on my body. Which, objectively, is good since I don't think I have been eating enough the last year (no where near overweight, but not super skinny, I guess?). But ever since last night, I cannot convince myself to eat anything, and I have barely drank anything, even though it's very hot here and my house has no A/C.

Part of it is the weight, part of it is not feeling like I deserve to eat, or I need punished for everything going on. I have two roommates, but they haven't noticed and I don't want to bother them. I know logically that I need to eat and drink, but I feel like I can barely move and my head is all foggy. And I still feel like I shouldn't eat, even though I know that's not true.

Just before the crisis I spent a year as a stay at home dad raising my son, the only difference is now my partner and her two children are home all day as well. I went back to work after my parental leave was up (for a month) and then got laid off because of covid and lack of work (I'm a silkscreen printer and a dam good one too, I have a lot of pride in my work and I'm not sure if I'll ever get to go back to that career which is depressing).
I find I have less patience, I'm quicker to anger and shout (there's lots of generational trauma there, I feel like my reaction is involuntary ""triggered"" even) and I'm probably experiencing compassion fatigue as my partner is on the autistic spectrum and she's not always easy to deal with.
I've had suicidal idolation petty much my whole life but it's been building in pressure in the back of my mind the last few months.
Couple months ago my best friend (I consider him my brother) went on a camping trip for our birthdays (both in June) for 5 days in the back country and had an amazing and fun time, it was exactly the kind of escape I so desperately needed. However, upon returning I fell into a deeper depression, I can't nail it down exactly but my line of thought is something like ""if this is the happiest I've been in a long time, and it'll probably be another year before I get to be happy again, what's the fucking point?""
I won't actually kill myself, I have reasons to live, my cat and my son. I'm just sick of feeling shitty and like the only way out is a buckshot salad.

Today I'm feeling low. Nothing is interesting to me. I feel trapped. I don't want to move, don't want to think, don't want to experience any form of human sensation.

I'm thinking back to that feeling I had a few days ago... and I wonder to myself... is that what every day is supposed to be like? That feeling, 'happiness'... I can remember feeling that only once before in my life, 7 years ago. That's not to say that I've not felt any positive emotions since then. But nothing so sustained. Nothing that seemed to emanate from inside of me. Usually my 'happiness' comes from those around me who lift me up. Spending time with friends. Music. Dancing. These things sometimes make me 'happy'... but the feeling passes as my smile fades.

63,"I don’t know where to start. For years I tried to be the “man” and ignore everything that bothers me. Just push it down and leave it there. Today I went overboard.

I am 16. And since I’ve been 10 I went through a lot, mentally. My dad almost disowning me, my parents calling be disabled fat pig, suicide attempt, getting heartbroken, losing all of my friends, almost failing school, and lastly this fucking isolation. I ignored all of that. Yes, it bothered me, but I was trying to be as much of a man as I can and push it down. Until today. 

I’ve met a girl recently, she’s the best person ever. We started dating and I just couldn’t get enough of her. I constantly miss her, and that’s when my insecurities started to pop up. I just always think that she will leave, cheat or play me. I constantly check her location. Constantly think “why isn’t she answering? I saw her online” “where is she?” “who is she talking to?” just constantly. It all happened before, and I was hoping it went away, but it didn’t. 

Once I realized that, I burst out and started to cry. Popped like a bubble. 

Just like a bitch. I couldn’t stop, I realized, I am depressed. I can’t be happy on my own. I’m like a cripple, I need someone to help me. And when I don’t have that someone - I’m depressed. I realized that I was never happy recently, and pushing all of it down doesn’t help. Like now she’s out with friends and I can’t be just happy for her like a human being, I have to check her location, everything. I’m so ashamed of myself for crying, for checking her location, for not trusting. I feel so disgusting. I don’t know what to do. I wish I did.

67,"I am 21 (f) and I just realized I may have adhd. I'm getting the actual test next week, but I keep meeting adults with adhd who have similar stories (finding out so late in life).  Adhd is widely considered a condition for children, so I never even considered it to be the reason for my inability to focus, my forgetfulness (I lost 4 phones last year), my over active thoughts, etc. 

I've been avoiding smoking weed because every time I smoke I become so aware of my body and I realize that I constantly live in a headspace that is so loud. I dissociate so badly that it feels like I my head is controlling me like a robot, narrating my every move (instead of me just living in the moment I'm in, I'm analyzing it.) My body constantly aches because I'm never really present in it. I am so tense and my posture is so bad. I catch myself with the blankest face and my body crumpled in a position literally like someone unplugged me. The most common racing thoughts are a repetition of a conversation I just had, a conversation I may have, or a completely unrealistic narration of a situation that will never occur---convincing me that  my roommate doesn't actually like me (we're best friends. When it's not a thought like that, its music or background noise. Not even like a song stuck in your head. The music switches songs like it would if the radio was on in my brain. The background noise sounds like I'm sitting in the middle of a crowded restaurant. I literally hear strangers conversations like re-hearing everything I heard at work. I'm a bartender/server and at work I go in to a full blown trance just doing things by muscle memory and feeling like my customers hate me. The only times I ever feel normal anymore are when I'm bartending with a very small amount of people at the bar that I know. I don't know if its because it's positive attention and I'm comfortable back there or what, but it only happens on occasion. 

I know I need to start meditating. I've tried, but I need to really look at it as a cure that could help me actually live my life. That's how I need to use weed too. When I smoke around groups or really anyone else, my brain goes in to over drive and I get crippling anxiety because I feel like I'm walking around with this really tragic mental illness that no one knows I have. When I smoke small amounts at home, I do things like this, and try to look for help. I get so scared to smoke after a bad high around group that it always turns me off of smoking alone for a couple weeks. 

I know I have a severe case of dissociative disorder and I'm figuring out the adhd so please don't diagnose me. That will make my anxiety crazy; I'm just looking for similar experiences to feel normal and tips that have helped people turn their mind off and be present.",27Sep2020,1

I try and ignore the feeling most of the time but I am constantly aware of the dirty stuff. I don’t see any germs or anything ( like it’s romanticised in the movies or tv shows ) but touching anything after touching my phone or the mouse to my pc or even the remote ( basically anything that isn’t washed ) is really messing me up.

82,"I try to keep myself busy so I don’t spiral into a meltdown sometimes. 

Some days I feel like shit, and today is one of those days. 

I’m a bit stressed out from a few issues and things i’m going through— Not the most stress I’ve been through, but it’s hitting me the hardest. 

I was really stable until about two days ago. I kinda feel back into crying a lot and just lashing out. I’m irrational, and irritable, and I hate it. 

Unless I’m focused complete on something or other I cry. It’s been that way for two days. If i’m watching TV, doing a puzzle, playing games or something that needs my focus, I become really like completely into that. If I’m not completely focused I’m holding back tears. 

I can’t even pin point why I’m crying. My heart just feels heavy and pounding and I’m just tired. 

Food feels icky, sleeping is hard, writing this is taking too long. 

I have school in a few days, I can’t go like this, I need to fix it. No one at school has seen me cry, and frankly I’d rather keep it that way. You guys been through something similar? Got any advice?",27Sep2020,1
83,"
I had never planned on being alive for much longer than this. I hoped and Literally prayed to die in my teens. Anyway, things changed, I started to fear death. But I didn't love life. It was one of my lowest I had ever been. I wasn't happy but I had no escape. I would have panic attacks every night before going to bed so I never really slept. I was so sleep deprived that I could bearly function in school. I felt so hopeless, my mind was just in such a shitty place. So I tried to reach out to my family, specifically my mom and (step) sister. They both kinda listen then basically just went ""oof pray on it""

Pray on it. That wasn't what I need to FUCKING hear. Literally just a little comfort, that's all I wanted from you guys. Not to mention Im a very private person, that was hard for me to even say anything.

Anyways fast. It's only gotten worst. I started getting anxious or have a panic attack doing anything. Car rides, walking down the street, empty parking lots at night. The intrusive thoughts kept telling me I was going to die doing that or being there everyone was going to die. So I tried to reach out again, this time just to my mom. I told her ""I think I might have anxiety"" (I probably don't but at the time I thought maybe) at first she said no you don't, but she later apologized and told me she should listen to me. I thought I she was finally realizing that I needed some support. Then a few days later she mockingly brought it up to my aunt and cousin... It was at that point I just decided to stop putting myself out there.

More months later. I'm even worst. The intrusive thoughts have expand beyond death and sleep was even harder. It didn't help that my mom had just had my youngest brother, c section. Step dad was at work all day, sister with her mom and it was the summer. So it was me who needed to help take care of both of them. Almost every day I would get scolded for being so tired. She would yell telling me that I need to go to bed earlier, don't I know that she needed my help!? How could I be so irresponsible!? I tried to explain to her that I couldn't, that my brain would not let me. But she never fucking listened. 

So one day after another getting maybe 3-2hrs of sleep every night. My impulse control went out the window. I indulged in a few of the intrusive thoughts. I tried to make myself vomit bc I felt I was to fat. Had several panic attacks bc I was so tired, so fucking tired of trying to block them out. And then at the end of it all I was laying on my floor, drained From the fighting and pretending to be alright, I gradded a dull ass knife from my floor. I remember taking it, then slowly pressing it on my skin, it hurt a bit, but I kept going, suddenly I was putting as much force as I could into this knife, trying to press it's blade threw my skin. I looked at the mark it left when I finally stopped, it felt good, I felt good, for the first time in so long. I cut myself a few more times. I remember feeling happy, the Thoughts in my brain were finally quiet, they were QUIET. I slept peacefully that night.

I enjoyed this new hobbie of mine. Until a few days later when my best friend pointed out the marks, I said it was my cat. But that was the day I realized I needed to be more careful. So I learned to repress my feelings until I couldn't, then I would cut myself and they all went away :)

Every one was happy.

But then they found out. Took me to a crappy hospital for a physc evaluation. Then not only did she have the nerve to take that away from me, she also made me explain what happened to my sister RIGHT AFTER I GOT HOME. I was exhausted from that whole deal crYing all day having, to feel everything at once and no way to stop it, when I got home all I wanted to do was cry myself to sleep. but my step dad decided it was his time to shine, he brought my sister and himself into my room, sat down by my bed and said 

""why didn't you talk to us :(""

I feel like there’s nothing meaningful in my life anymore. It’s not anyone’s fault. It’s not due to a specific event or anything. Everything just piled on. I moved away a couple years ago. I never really got into the crown at my new school. The best moments of my high school life are when i revisit my hometown and see the people i grew up with, which makes me constantly think about how much better my life would be if i stayed. My best friend was my cousin for the next year and a half-ish after i moved, but he passed away last October from a seizure. And since then, i just feel so alone. I don’t have a real connection with anyone. And honestly, I don’t have the motivation to form any new relationships with people. I’d rather just be alone, and I hate myself for that. 

It probably sounds so stupid, but i just can’t bring myself do to anything anymore. I just do what I have to do. I feel like I’m going through the same thing every day. And then I get home and realize that everything has just been distracting me from how i feel about my life. Even after I get home, i try to distract myself even more so i don’t just sit and cry in my bed until i go to sleep. I’ll just mindlessly watch TV or get high or something so i don’t have to deal with it. It just feels like i’m going in circles everyday. Everything just seems so pointless.

My parents delivered that fate. My dad never loved my mom, and I was raised single parent by her. I didn't grow up Christian but have come to understand God a lot more through friends. One day I was thinking about my life and how I was practically an orphan growing up, and a thought came to me.   


A father is suppose to protect his family, and ensure their well-being. But my father was unable to do that, and instead, turned right around to destroy us. When I die, I want to be able to go there where my loving parents are. But I don't know who they are, because I was never giving that in this life. If that's the case, then on my suffering and agony, I cast this curse for God's consideration.

My mental health has been bad for years now and it's gotten especially worse during quarantine and much much worse in the past two months. Like as someone who's very afraid of death, the thoughts of suicide have crossed my mind and I'm so scared that it's already gotten to this point. (I won't ever do it though. I'm also overworking myself with doing school stuff to distract myself from all my tormenting thoughts)

I answered a mental health form for school as part of requirements and to no surprise, they told me I showed severe signs of possibly having mental health illnesses and to reach out to a therapist or a mental health service. If my parents find out, I'm pretty sure their reaction will just make me feel worse (e.g. religious words, trying to invade my personal space that i get very distressed over if it's disturbed) so I can't ask them to pay for a therapist.

I know I need help, I've wanted help and for a long time now. Thankfully my school offers free mental health services, however it's been so long already. They said to wait and the demand is high so it could take a while but god, it's been painfully long. I'm pretty sure if I wasn't afraid, I would've committed suicide by now.

I signed up for two of them just in case, it's been two months for one of them and one month for the other. That doesn't sound too long but when everyday is painful and I'm just barely hanging on, it feels like forever. The former got back to me like a week ago to reassure me that I'm still on the waitlist. The latter replied to me a day later I e-mailed them to acknowledge but haven't gotten back to me since.

I'm just here waiting as whatever's left of me continues to crumble. I know getting help wouldn't immediately makes things better but I'm desperate. I'm hurting myself and those around me that I care about. I really want to get professional help. I hope they get back to me soon.",27Sep2020,1

125,"on monday my friend od’d and he got admitted to the emergency room and later he got admitted to a psychiatric hospital.

i was with him while he was overdosing and i called the ambulance. i had a literal mental breakdown. when i was in the ambulance with him the only thing i could do was crying. we got at the emergency room and i started crying again. it was really hard to go through this process because i got flashbacks from my own hospitalisation after overdosing earlier this year.

i was there for him when he needed someone the most. i was with him when he was in the ambulance, when he was at the emergency room, and when he got admitted to the psychiatric hospital. i brought his stuff to the psychiatric hospital in the afternoon and i brought him snacks and drinks. i wanted to do everything that people couldn’t do for me when i got hospitalised in the end of february. i’ve been visiting him often since he got hospitalised.

on wednesday evening, i was going through so much ptsd flashbacks from what happened to my friend on monday morning that i started writing in my book. i’m not copying the whole text because it’s quite personal but basically, one of the most important lines was ‘i don’t want to die. but i do want peace in my head.’

one hour later i overdosed on antidepressants and antipsychotics and i was drinking alcohol. i got a full blown panic attack and i walked to the hospital in my area and i told them that i needed help. i got admitted to the emergency room and i got admitted to internal medicine. the same room where i got hospitalised, around 6 months ago. with the same staff members like last time.

it was horrible. i can remember how i couldn’t speak full sentences and when i was about to be discharged from the hospital i could not walk normally. my boss from work came over and said that she didn’t know the ‘person’ who was laying on the bed because i was so different than usual.

it has been 2-3 days since i got discharged from the hospital and i’m not feeling well. i feel alone and empty. my housemates are not here and i’m all alone in this house. i can’t stand it here. i’m going through a lot of anxiety because in my country we are going through a second wave of covid-19 and scientists are saying that most likely we will go back in lockdown in at least six weeks.

it makes me struggle a lot. i know that it might take longer or it might not even happen. but the idea of going through another lockdown again, being at home with no people around me, while going through so much with my mental health, it makes me scared. i told my psychologist that if we would go through a second lockdown that i’m not sure if i will make it alone and that i might need to be hospitalised in a psychiatric hospital.

i know that from everything i went through, that it was a step back in recovery, but that i’m going to make more steps towards recovery. but for now. it’s difficult. i’m trying to be healthy. i’ve been eating a lot of fruit and i’ve been cutting off drinks with a lot of sugar. and i’ve been eating healthy. i feel okay physically wise, but mentally wise, i’m feeling not okay. i try to push forward and help my friend and myself in this period of time but it’s difficult. i wish that someone would check up on me and see how i am doing or if they would visit me, but nobody is doing that. and it’s kind of hard going through this process alone...",27Sep2020,1

129,"I've been really, REALLY depressed recently and have just had a horrible week.

First of all, I thought I had a crush on this guy (who is now my friend), who I knew liked my best friend. My best friend is going through a  break up rn. He admitted he kind of liked me in a way but not really. He and my best friend are together now which sucked at the time, but now I realize that it wasn't quite a crush in him but more specifically just happiness that I got emotional and physical validation (cuddles and hugs and such).

I felt sort of led on honestly and rejected, like I was 2nd best almost? (He had liked her first for a while so I mean. I get it?) He apologised and felt really bad (she did too) and he still wanted to be friends with me.

So after realizing it wasn't really a crush on him and more just a feeling of loneliness and WANTING to like someone in general - my pet bird dies. He was young, healthy, and I wasn't expecting it. I got the call that he was missing from his cage heard a scream over the phone. And yep - he was dead. 

My little bird, my pet who I loved so much, is dead. And I feel like it's all my fault.

On top of this my parents (particularly my mom) has been very aggressive and angry with me recently. My home environment is getting worse and worse (I live with my parents bc of covid)

I've been hanging out with this guy and my best friend a lot, bc I know she is still working through the break up - plus the guy likes to help me talk through any issues I have. I feel like a 3rd wheel or someone who is just a nuisance everytime I hang out with them. They say I'm not and they want me around but I can't help but feel like an idiot every time they kiss or say something nice to each other.

I also will admit that I'm slightly jealous my friend is able to live out a rescue fantasy - being saved from her current abusive relationship by some sweet guy. Why didn't I deserve that?

I've been in a relationship before, but i didn't even like the guy. Its because he was the first guy who has ever called me pretty and it ended up being abusive/toxic. It's horrible bc I have severe trust issues and have only ever seen abusive relationships that never last (my parents' being the number one example). But some stupid part of me still wants to date and find my soulmate who I know deep down doesn't exist.

Apparently people say I'm pretty even tho no guys have ever really approached me to say so. 

But, funny ebough being the 3rd wheel (I always am) still better than being at my place with my parents, so.

Meanwhile my major depression symptoms have come back, the chest pain and suicidal thoughts mostly. It sounds so stupid but everyone is getting into relationships, moving forward in life, and seem so happy. Meanwhile I'm stuck here.

The guy tried setting me up with his friend - but he didn't add me back on Snapchat so there's that. Plus I don't even know if I'm even attracted to him. (I'm Demisexual - I really want to know someone before I date them. It's hard for me to be attracted to people).

And the final cherry on top is I was going to play video games with them after I got home. And I go on Discord bc they're on the server we play on. His mic was on and... well, I heard then fucking. I mean I clicked out as fast as I could but still... *shudder*. So that was awkward and uncomfortable.

I've had a shit week, also I love my best friend and really like this guy he's become a close friend honestly; but idk if I can hang around them anymore - at least not for a while. It makes me feel like shit bc they get to be cute together and I have no one. But also I don't want to be a bitch and make everything about myself bc I know other people are having hard times too rn.",27Sep2020,1

135,"I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder 3 years ago. I felt the need to tell my boyfriend this, because of the effect the diagnosis might have on my relationships.

But he didn't take it well. He ""educated"" himself on the matter, and every time we had an argument he'd say ""Are you having a bpd moment again?"" I'd try my uttermost best to accommodate him, to change certain behaviors, reactions and habits. But it was never enough. 

My mother also had the same reaction, more or less. She believed that I'd never change since there's something fundamentally wrong with my personality. Neither of them was supportive when it came to my therapy. 

I'm also a little slow when it comes to reading the room... And often times they'd be upset at me, and I wouldn't pick up on time. Or I'd misinterpret what they're expressing. This caused tension in so many of my relationships. Id often get defensive when it's not needed. And I sometimes struggle to communicate my emotions. Like when people are crossing boundaries or if I want to express happiness or sadness. It's as if my brain just doesn't know how to align my thoughts, they're all over the place. 


My boyfriend was the closest person to me, but eventually he left me. It broke me, and despite our turmoil seemed unexpected. Sure we had bad times but we had really amazing times aswell. My mother's rejection was too much to handle as well... So I ended up isolating myself from the little friends I had. I became socially distant, and barely left my apartment.

I also stopped seeing my therapist, and started consulting with a new, local therapist, but our sessions were initially online. She asked if I would like to have sessions with her in person, because she felt a little off about my diagnosis.

A couple of months in, she diagnosed me with Autism Spectrum Disorder... She said the borderline personality disorder was likely a misdiagnosis, and that it's actually common for ASD to be misdiagnosed as BPD in females. The new therapy is helping me a lot, and I'm making progress. There's still a lot I have to learn though. When I told my mother this, she apologized for the way she treated me. But I don't know if I'm ready to forgive her yet.

Be it autism... Bpb...depression or whatever, this stigma around people with mental illnesses is toxic. Mental illnesses is either romanticized  in media or judged into the ground. 

I really didn't have a nice experience, and drove me to a point where I overdosed on sleeping pills hoping that it would kill me. Because I believed there's something fundamentally wrong with me. Because I believed that I'm a toxic person whom don't deserve love and don't deserve to be here. We deserve to be here as much as the next person. Instead of spreading hate, online communities should urge mentally ill people to get proper help and to better themselves. It can literally save lives, because it saved mine.

The woman on the phone went through some questions with me and then asked me to discuss what was wrong, but to be honest there’s so many things wrong that I didn’t even know where to start. I tried to articulate my struggles as best I could.

He is mostly a good man, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him angry and he never showed any sort abusive behavior. He respects me, he is polite, he helps me around the house, we still do dates once a week, he is supportive, he gives me compliments from time to time, he cuddles me at night, he also says he loves me. The only problem is he claims that being married is a burden and he regrets marrying me.

We got married this year for practical reasons that align very well with our future plans as a couple (visa and insurance related stuff), but we still had a very cute and wholesome little wedding. Even before getting married he kept saying that he hates the idea of marriage and even the idea of a relationship, that he wants to be alone and “spend his whole life alone without being vulnerable”. Of course, I always respond him with a question: “why are you still with me?” But he never answers anything concrete and that’s where the discussion ends. And he continues to be with me and keeps making plans with me. Of course his words hurt me, but I always try to not take him serious when he’s talking like that, and just keep in mind his overall good behavior.

I think those harsh affirmations are the product of some mental issue, but I have no idea which one. He categorically refuses to talk to a therapist and even to me about it. I think his father fucked him up somehow, but he wouldn’t say - all I know is that man has 2 wifes and like 15 kids and my husband is only talking to him on the phone once a year, which makes him visibly distressed.

159," Like a subset of the population my personality is such that I lean towards introversion and I suffer from social anxiety. It never fails to fascinate me how diverse the human experience is. I am naturally an observer of life, feeling as though I am always on the outside looking in. I guess too, this experience exists on a spectrum and we all experience it to some degree. However, as a social anxious introvert it is perhaps difficult for one not possessing these characteristics to empathise with how these traits dictate my human experience. 

Well here is my attempt to paint a picture of how my mind works: 

In my own company I feel normal, safe, and comfortable. But when other humans are around, my conscious experience alters significantly, and the degree of changes is completely dependent on factors such as how familiar I am with the other people. Around family and friends, I can imagine that the thoughts evoked are somewhat similar to the normal response to encounters with others. However, when I am surrounded by unfamiliar people it is almost as thought a subconscious switch is turned on. The most extreme differences in how my mind works is when I am in a performance-based situation such as presenting in front of others, or during a job interview. In these contexts, despite my logical brain knowing that the situation is non-threatening, I became self-conscious. The sensation is almost like a spotlight is shined on me and that the other people are scrutinising and conscious of every verbal and non-verbal form of communicating that I elicit. 

I have been told that during these social contexts there is no evidence that I am experiencing this extreme anxiety, but it is there, and it is extremely debilitating. It exists not only in these infrequent situations but also in everyday situations like going to the shopping mall alone, at the gym, or during events like a dinner with work colleagues. Though my description of this experience may seem quite maladaptive and a distressing thing to live with, I have become accustomed to it and have come to accept that it is something that is unlikely to ever go away. 

I have received psychological treatment, tried anti-depressant medication, educated myself on psychology and tried techniques like systematic desensitisation. All of these have not worked. Sometimes I feel like I am just not a normal person and never will be. My unique human experience is just something I must deal with. I cannot quite put my finger on why I am like this, but I also struggle to form meaningful relationships with others. I only have one real friend. It is a rather solitude, lonely existence that I have but I am okay with it. I have had two very beautiful girlfriends, but both relationships never lasted. When I reflect on both, the destruction lies solely on me. Well, in the sense that I ended them. My first relationship lasting 1.5 years and the second, 2 years. In both cases though, the common theme was that after about a year or so, my partners realised that my openness hit a plateu. I never reached the higher stages of relationship formation as I keep such a high guard. I lack the ability to put my full trust in others and deep down I have a feeling that one day I will be betrayed.

But then again, perhaps the reasons why I ended the second relationship are logical and just. In short, we met while she still had a boyfriend (but she told me that she was single). She then left him for me (after being with him for four years). Then during the early part of the relationship, I sensed that she would push away from me, and on a couple of occasions compared me to him such that she put him in a positive light. She would also demand that I allow her to read my messages to friends and family. Other events happened as you can imagine but in the end, I broke it off as I felt suffocated and controlled. Now I am back with me myself and I, an observer of life.

For some reason I am locking myself away from reality more than ever before. I spend the majority of my time escaping on my phone and headphones. I’m rarely ever talking to anyone or sharing things, I just put myself completely into that virtual world and don’t know how to escape. It also makes the people in my reality upset as they feel I don’t care.

171,"TW: accidents, dying, intrusive thoughts

Hello! I am posting here for the first time in hopes of finding some insight into what is happening to me. I want to say that I am looking to go see a therapist about this as well, but I wanted to know if anyone shares this experience and what it could mean.

I think about dying a lot. Every day, in fact. I am not suicidal in the least, so my thoughts are not about me wanting to die. Instead I keep imagining horrible situations where either myself or someone I care about gets killed or minimum seriously injured. For example, I will be riding a bus to work, and when we hit the freeway I will start fearing that the driver will have a seizure and lose control of the vehicle. Or that when I'm taking a bath, I will start thinking ""what if I fall asleep and drown accidentally?"" Going down a flight of stairs I will imagine myself falling and getting seriously injured. You get the picture.

I know intrusive thoughts are a thing that everyone gets. Everyone has had the ""what if I walked into traffic right now?"" thought that comes and goes as quickly as it appeared. However for me these thoughts have become a daily occurance. And they don't go away until the bus has come to a stop or I've reached the end of the stairs. They have become so frequent that I did not even realise that it's probably not normal to have these kinds of thoughts until a couple of weeks ago when the above mentioned bath thought occured. Because I had grown so accustomed to thinking these things every day, I had not mentioned them to anyone until last night when I confined in my boyfriend that I am a little concerned if I might have some sort of anxiety condition.

Has anyone else experienced this? Have you received a diagnosis/help to help stop these thoughts? I don't feel like they interfere with my life too much, but it is of course uncomfortable and makes me scared and nervous when these thoughts occur.

Any insight is greatly appreciated.",27Sep2020,1
172,"Hi, I have a question. Namely, sometimes when I drink I completely go crazy. And by crazy I do not mean “wild party girl” crazy - no. I go full psycho. This happens whenever my boyfriend and I have had a quarrel, prior to my drinking(night out with girls, friends, whatever). Yesterday night, I was out with my girls and he came to get me so we could go home together. On the way home, we started arguing, I started insulting him - and he left in another direction. I tried calling him, but his battery was off. I came home an hour later, furious and drunk, because he left me basically. When I came home.. well, I started yelling and throwing stuff and more yelling and crying - I even slapped him. I am desperate. I feel terrible.  This is not the first time I have had episodes like this. This year in January I was diagnosed with depression, does these episodes have something to do with that, or am I just a hopeless case?",27Sep2020,1
173,"My partner (24M) has suffered from depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. He has finally sought out a therapist, and he has told me a few times what he learned in his sessions. Sometimes what he tells me is concerning/ I don't think good advice.

For example, the therapist told him not to do things that stress him out...well, my partner has stopped doing school work and work for his job because they stress him out. This worries me because these things aren't okay to skip. He could lose his job or fail school if he doesn't do his work. His work ended up emailing him with a complaint, which caused him lots of stress- but no change in behavior.

With that, his therapist also told him to invest in self care/time for himself. He has taken this to mean spending every day playing video games, even skipping class once because ""self care."" Is there such thing as too much self care?

Another thing was that his therapist validates his anxieties, even the extreme ones like opening the windows will let in ""COVID air"" or that going outside will contaminate us. I feel like this made him back track (before therapy, he actually went outside to take out the trash and didn't shower immediately after)

He likes his therapist and I'm so happy he has someone to talk to, but I just feel like this is all bad advice. He went to her earlier this week for a check in and I though she'd comment on taking self care/avoidance too far or that maybe he misinterpreted the advice, but she didn't.

176,"Hey guys. I don’t mean to come off as rude here. Im not saying these people don’t struggle with mental health problems but since when did people bring up how their mental health is affected by every little thing? I totally get that online classes are hard. But if you want me to be honest, my mental health got better when school went online. I don’t have as much pressure to force myself out of bed, get to class on time, walk all around campus... There is a pandemic going on right now and we can’t have in person classes. They started a petition to make this semester pass/fail instead of have a GPA. This would hurt students who need to get their GPA up/need that number for future employers and stuff. 

A lot of people are saying that online classes are affecting their mental health. I believe it. I’m not undermining their experiences, but it’s so annoying because these same people are the ones who aren’t understanding that there is literally a pandemic going on! Plus, they don’t take people in crisis seriously! I have OCD, and it’s bad (I get violent intrusive thoughts). The same people would probably call me insane. I’m not saying I have it worse, but I think these people need to educate themselves on what real mental illness is. It’s not something that suddenly arises because you didn’t get the chance to party in the dorms this year. It sucks I know, but everyone else is in the same boat. 

Like I said if these people do have mental health problems or toxic households I completely get it.

178,"Not here to incite any level of hate towards the South Asian community, but I'm here rather to touch on the stigmas surrounding mental health within these communities (from my own personal experiences) and why such dogmatic and outdated views are detrimental to the psychological development of the individual.

Again, this is just my own personal opinion and I am in no way advocating hate.

I am speaking on the cultural paradigm within these communities and the problematic views which negatively impact mental health. 

I am in the process of writing a book (several actually), and if anything here is deemed offensive then I would truly truly truly appreciate the feedback so I may correct myself in places I am wrong and/or vice versa.

Criticism is what I desperately need right now, thanks.

I come from a strong South-Asian background, I was raised with a simplistic view on the world where there lies a predetermined set of appropriate career paths, lifestyle choices, habits, etc. that one must abide by if they want to succeed in this life.

Thus any individual who strays away from these so called ""ideals"" is considered an abnormality and attributed with factors such as being delinquent, irrational, and/or lacking a base level of intelligence... all in all suggesting that one who takes ""the road less travelled by"" is merely enacting a form of rebellion against their true purpose and are ultimately not fulfilling their true destiny. 

In other words, choosing to pursue a degree in sociology, might raise an eyebrow (it most definitely will) and instill the narrative that your choice to not become a lawyer is probably because you lacked the necessary discipline, intellect, and/or maturity.. in most cases the fault is then placed on the parents for raising such a ""fudhu"" (loser).

LET ME ASSURE YOU, your life is not decided by the accomplishments/decisions of people you probably don't even know (or care about).

If you're anything like me, then you're probably being compared to that one (or several if your family is huge) relative in your family who went to University and acquired a prestigious job shortly after graduation... that individual is not your competition &amp; he/she IS NOT YOUR ROLE MODEL

This is not to say this individual is a piece of s**t (in my situation however this relative of mine is), but rather what I am trying to get you to understand is that, they shouldn't serve as your guide to success.

Though it is easier said than done, YOUR LIFE is determined solely by YOU. (I will start a separate discussion on this)

YES, these cultural and social factors through our early upbringing play a big role in our psychological development, yet the level of importance it is given seems to take precedence over everything else. 

As I grew older I noticed the following:

1) Mental health in general was never advocated in a positive light.

Those who suffer from mental health such as depression are subject to not a broken but different(unique) neurological composition that is deemed abnormal as it strays away from society's plethora of neurotypical individuals. (Yes I understand this is me very very very basically generalizing… I will touch on this in a later discussion) 

Being depressed meant you weren't grateful, it meant you lacked faith in God, it meant you spent way too much time behind a computer screen, and thus the constitution of your wave of misery is solely a byproduct of your “poor” choices in life. 

The poor choice could be something such as not wanting to go to law school like your cousin because the realm of litigation was beyond your scope of interest

The poor choice could be you deciding to go to college instead of university.. Like all of your other relatives. 

Perhaps through rigorous research on neuroscience, you came to terms with the notion that perhaps religion may not be the answer to everything you grew up believing.

Maybe, just maybe, you've come to realize that your depression is not due to the fact that you chose to believe in science BUT MAYBE it is due to the negative implications brought via your upbringing. 

Furthermore, going back to my favorite group of religious activists who state that those who wallow in their melancholic pool of sadness have simply “lost their way” 

Imagine telling someone that their brains chemical composition is simply due to their level  of religious devotion(or lack thereof).. Read this again out loud and tell me where it makes sense. 

This further reinforces an ideology that neuroscience, psychiatry, the study of OUR ENTIRE NERVOUS SYSTEM are merely gimmicks and it's ultimately your faith that constitutes your quality of life. 

I am not trying to downplay the positivity brought via faith, as I am a firm believer in God and my faith has bestowed me with the ability to conquer my adversities on several occasions.. but my belief in God does not eradicate the fact that my faith alone is not a cure and that this toxic and dogmatic approach to understanding (I'd prefer to say neglecting) the realm of mental health is purely detrimental.  

2) Religion being the ultimate cure.

When it comes down to religion, it baffles me as to why many profound scholars tie the nurturing of mental health to religious doctrines.

With all due respect and with our advancements in science, religion is not a guide to curing mental health. 

This is not suggesting that religion has no place in the realm of psychological therapy, the problem I am referring to is the notion that religion itself is not enough on its own to help combat issues such as depression, ADHD, anxiety, OCD, etc. 

The notion that simply following religious customs such as praying and reciting a passage is enough on its own to cure one's fragile neurological makeup is absurd. 

Many of these same individuals who preach the concept of faith/belief in God are quite possibly suffering from a degree of mental health issues themselves but are too ignorant to accept that their sole devotion to God is not enough to control their bodies most complex organ, the human brain.. 

Religious/Cultural values are ONE PART OF YOU LIFE, they are not YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.",27Sep2020,1
179,"What’s good everyone! I (24F) hear a lot of people attribute their negative symptoms to Antipsychotics. However, I’ve never taken any pharmaceutical medications in my life. I’m suffering from debilitating negative symptoms that are completely derailing the course of my life and I’m feeling very scared and alone. 

I smoked a lot of weed in the past year (sadly had to quit) which triggered paranoia, anxiety, a couple panic attacks, a spiritual ‘awakening’ and some slightly delusional thinking. For the most part though, this experience was positive for me and I was manic creative. As an artist, this phase was like a dream, and I actually miss it🧞‍♀️I didn’t realize I was in psychosis, nor did friends or family because I didn’t do anything too out of the ordinary. Though a few expressed some concern. 

**I’d also like to mention that during quarantine a friend of mine gave me ‘shake,’ and now in retrospect I’m worried that it was actually laced weed cause it was broken up into small pieces and smelled weird. God forbid it was K2💀I realize I’m a dumbass for smoking it. But anyone w experience smoking that (accidental or intentional), I welcome your insight, especially w regards to any cognitive deficits it might have caused. 

🚨🚨Here’s where shit goes down &amp; I need your help: I temporarily stopped smoking daily when I went on a roadtrip to visit my dying grandfather, and on the way back I was ruminating while in the car for 7 days &amp; developed so much anxiety about my career/life that I was constantly dry heaving and tossing and turning in my sleep. This anxiety increased when I got home and I felt like my life was over due to certain circumstances. For a couple weeks I was in panic mode- never had more anxiety in my entire life😖I only smoked like 4 times since returning from this trip and then I basically just quit. After that panic episode, my brain 🧠 SNAPPED. The whole frontal portion of my brain in charge of executive functioning shut off- I didn’t know this was possible🤯. I experience a pressure feeling in the front part of my skull that never subsides, as if my brain is inflamed. My internal monologue, thoughts and imagination went completely blank- now I only have songs playing in my head. I almost became mute because I had difficulty speaking and recalling words and memories. I was once a prolific writer but now it takes forever to write coherent paragraphs like this, and it’s not nearly close to the level it used to be. I became dissociated and felt like the old me had died, and didn’t feel aligned with my body. I became emotionally numb and couldn’t cry even though I was suicidal. Overall, I felt like I lost 20 IQ points. Even my eyesight changed- when I go on walks outside it feels like my brain is trying to catch up to my surroundings. As I write this, I’m writing on autopilot. I can’t think ahead, think in general, or think deeply. I started isolating myself from friends because I was ashamed of my cognitive decline and inability to contribute valuable responses to conversations. It also takes so much more energy to reply, and I’ve spent most of my days in bed desperately trying to figure out wtf happened to me. I feel like I lost every aspect of myself that can contribute something of value to the world and I’m surprised that my boyfriend, family and friends still love me. The only reason I’m able to write this is because I’ve repeated this story to tons of health professionals who haven’t been able to help me. Btw I was 5150’d for suicidal ideation because I felt like I *literally* lost half my brain capacity and my soul entirely and didn’t know how I’d continue on in this life as a functioning adult without it. My psychiatrist (who speaks over me and doesn’t know me well) says I had drug induced psychosis and wants to label me as bipolar... but I am dealing with all the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. I know one of the main attributes to schizo are cognitive deficits and loss of gray matter in the brain due to inflammation. I’m so terrified that I’ll be like this forever and that I’m brain damaged. It’s scary to lose your consciousness, ability to think, majority of your memories, and personality.

186,"Long story short, I've always probably had depression in some form or another (it seems to come with the territory of having Asperger's/high-functioning autism. However after a number of different toxic work environments after college, it went from manageable, to full-blown major depression disorder. I had tried several different meds (all of which were ineffective and one even had a negative side effect which  triggered my epilepsy, landing me in the hospital)I was seeing a therapist during the whole time (honestly since high school) and despite it all suicide was on my mind daily and I even attempted a couple times.

Finally, what did help was leaving my career entirely (the first one just kind of set the tone for the others and, as you can probably tell by the username, why I'm so lost in that area) and doing TMS 3 times (currently on my third session now, mostly maintenance, I went into feeling pretty good; today's kind of an off day, but it hasn't been the norm in a while). I did TMS once while in one of my ""professional"" jobs and twice while not in them. The ones outside of those jobs were most successful. The one I did in-between was basically totally ineffective. The TMS tech told me that there was only so much the TMS could do and that I should probably consider leaving the job because it obviously wasn't working out and she was right; so I did.

In any event, despite feeling largely better, I still find myself ruminating and I'm just as ""stuck"" and doubtful about my future. I'd say maybe I'm back to my old normal level of depression I guess (prior to everything going off the rails) and to be honest, it's all I've really ever known for as long as I can remember, so I guess I'm back to ""normal;"" always stuck in my head, introverted, etc. 

But I'm beyond stuck. I still feel like a total abysmal failure; having gone from an engineer to retail and still living home just demoralizes the hell out of me. Heck, I could've been a good emo kid in high school if I cared about fashion enough to dress the part. My boss offered me a full time position because he saw I do a great job and I have a good work ethic (which I do). I took it for the money and health insurance, but I was more demoralized and down on myself for it than accepting it as a compliment because for me, it was a step into the ""permanence"" of a retail job and all I can focus on is trying to figure out my next ""big boy"" job (as my old boss would say).

192,"I have a hobby where I try and have polite and kind public conversations with people who hold a belief.  This week I spoke with Kim, who thinks we need more mental health education, especially for young people. I thought our exploration might be interesting for people here. https://youtu.be/i08WkyeiZVQ 

We spent a lot of time working on the claim itself (where does she actually think the education should take place?) and eventually she staked the claim that replacing some of the things that are taught in schools these days with a program teaching mental health skills (emotional regulation, critical thinking, dealing with stress, etc.) would be beneficial for individuals and society, at a confidence level of 70%.

We went between topics like: what makes a good team of ""experts"", to talking about how it would take ""hard evidence"" like studies to move her up to 90% confidence. We talked some about her positive personal experiences with therapy, and how those experiences might not be shared by everyone.

Conversations that go in this way (with someone who tries to remain neutral, talking with someone else who is making a claim, exploring justification and reasons for the belief, in a kind and supportive way, but also pushing back gently) is a movement called ""street epistemology"" (/r/StreetEpistemology).

Like do I call my GP or do I wait until I get a call from them. I've already been waiting two months, and nothing has gotten better regarding my mental health In fact it's gotten worse...

I still live in the same mentally abusive household. It's just my Mum being extremely toxic. We are not wealthy whatsoever, in fact it's fair to say we are poor.

I'm a forn of me who seea physical pain as a release. I don't tdo it from a place of logic, I don't do it for attention I do it because of an uncontrollable drive to do something. Where it be feel pain, where it be to make myself, its hard to say because I'm not operating with logic in those moments. Whs I manage to break free of the temporary psychosis, I feel shame. Deep undulating shame that I've let myself and my family down. So when a member of my family notices and sees said self harm, ihbderstabd that you're scared for the little boy you raised. I understand your fears and worries. I don't understand your anger, as though thereneeds to be a ""fuck sake what are you doing why are you doing this again"". Trust me I already feel sbit enough about it.
Next time you notice someone has self harmed that you care about, instead of getting angry, instead if making it about you do me one favour. As if we're OK. Ask wbats been going on that led to this. Ask if you can help in any menial way you can.
I burnt my hands pretty badly a couple weeks ago and my family noticed this week. They got mad. Nevermind the faxg that is frightened myself and immediately started all my meds again as a cushion. Never mind I've been activlly seeking a therapist to help talk me throufh stuff. I was met with hostility, such hostility that all I wanted to do was self harm further. As a loved one you hold power. Ask your friend, lover. Sibling what's going on, asking them what you can do to help. Don't make them feel any worse for something they probs ky already feel regret and shame over. We're doing our best and throwing more negativity our way because you're scared for us is causing more harm than good. Communicate sensibly ans hope you catch us in a frame of mind aay from the pyaxhosis. Listen to what we say even if its hard. We don't blame you for how we are genetically but personally I blame you ot a degree for how you handle a discovery of self harm because I can't help it often. And such negative, agressive réactions only serve to close me off further from you an ultimately put me back in a place of suicide risk.

Communicate but do it well, do it wtih compassion and do mnt act as if it's a person attack on you. Most of us are just trying to survive ojrselves each day and that's hard enough.",27Sep2020,1

Recently I’ve been like extending my neck and adjusting my shirt on my shoulders as my habit and it seems to happen about one every minute or so.

I can never sleep because I’m terrified of not waking up, I can’t go and try daring things or really even leave the house because I’m terrified of dying in some freak accident. I look at my loved ones and think “What’s the point? You’ll die someday- no matter how much I try I can’t stop thinking about the day you die” I don’t want to feel like nothing has a point anymore; I think about continuing education, before some voice back in my head scoffs, what’s the point anyway? Someday you’ll die and everything is for nothing. I cant DO anything without it hindering me.

I feel like at some point I’ll snap; and go full mental breakdown- I already feel like I’m halfway over that edge. Why can’t I seem to stop? everyone else seems to be able to at least ignore the fear the majority of the time...How do I make anything mean something again?

My mental health went downhill 2 years ago and I isolated myself socially and emotionally after a traumatic breakup. It took me a long time to regain my confidence and will to live. Still it hasn't been the same since. This year I had a few mental breakdowns and continued to isolate myself, not sharing my struggles with my friends because all I ever get is ""don't think about it"" or ""cheer up"" or ""you're overthinking it"". I've been really depressed for most of the year and I have no motivation to do absolutely anything. I don't feel like I can do anything with my life. I don't see myself as someone worthy of anything basically. I also hate taking risks as I'm very afraid of failing or being rejected. I have difficulty making friends and staying friends. No one around me can relate to this and when I mention anything about depression or Avoidant personality disorder (I have most of the symptoms of that and have experienced childhood emotional trauma) or even mental illness in general, I'm immediately dismissed.

207,"Hello everyone!

**Day 27 of Suicide Prevention Month**. Another day, another post! 

For today’s post, I will be listing the best (in my opinion) Mental Health channels on YouTube. These specific channels will provide support, their experience, how to cope etc. 

It may seem like that YouTube is filled with music videos, funny dog videos, vlogs, makeup tutorials and all that... but, it also has a special place for people suffering with Mental illness. There are hundreds of Mental Health YouTube channels out there, from mindful thinkers to profession therapists... 

**YouTube promotes Mental Health**. 

Here are some examples of them:

- Rowena Tsai

Rowena is known to being inspiring and compassionate. The 28 year old from LA creates videos about the transformative powers of mindfulness. She shares videos about how being mindfulness can improve your outlook in life. Rowena shares self-care habits that you’re able to do everyday. If you’re struggling, her videos will more than certain calm you down, with life changing results. A very nice, lovely and caring woman. Very much recommend! 

- Psych2Go

The YouTube channel “Psych2Go” is a Mental Health Organisation that posts education videos about Mental Health and relationships. These videos are added with a calm, soothing voiceover and each video is packed with bundles of information that keep you watching for hours on end. :)

- Kati Morton

Next on the list is Kati Morton. She is a licensed therapist making different Mental Health videos on her channel. For example, videos on... Depression, anxiety, eating disorders, self-harm and much more. The well-known channel currently sits at 1 million subs. Wow! 

- Timothy Gordon

Unfortunately, not a very well-known channel, currently sitting on 7,000 subscribers. But, at the end of the day, it doesn’t mean anything. As long as you post quality content, full of information and enjoyment, then it doesn’t matter how many subscribers you have. Timothy Gordon not only creates brand new videos, but also streams by supporting people who are self-isolating. Others videos he has contributed to: Yoga Challenge, Meditation, Mental Health tips, Anxiety, Depression, OCD, Stress, Worrying, Breathing, Self-Acceptance and much more. If you have the time, give the man some love! He deserves it. 

- Anna Akana

Deep chats about life adding in with some comedy and charm, here you have... Anna Akana. A woman who can show her fun side, along with her deep and serious side. It’s the best of both worlds! Anna is currently an actor, director and writer. She creates videos that are 3-4 minutes long with some jokes about the challenges that young adults face in everyday life. Anna goes on to talk about serious topics (especially about love and relationships). Also, therapy, self-love and comparing yourself to others, in a fun and serious way. Subscribe! 

And FYI, I can confirm that I am NOT one of these people looking for more subscribers! 😉

If you have the time, give some of these YouTubers a watch! 

Thank you for reading everyone. Have a great day! :)",27Sep2020,1
208,"Hello Reddit, 

I have a friend currently about to have a trial in the process of British Columbia‘s mental health panel. They are to assess him whether he deserves to stay as a certified patient requiring Injections. These injections are currently restricting him from doing things he loves most like drawing, cooking and get a job in the coffee roasting industry. He’s concerned- the current medication of the BC government simply isn’t working for him, numbing, draining and he’s gaining a lot of weight.

He’s had difficulty in the past, which started with antidepressant prescription drugs. He was diagnosed as schizophrenic last year but clearly getting better. He made mistakes through poor judgements based off lack of sleep, a prolonged period of being alone where thoughts aren’t so healthy at times. He understands this, we all fail.

His friends and I are both under the impression that his current diagnosis would be much better off practicing meditation, healthy exercise, eating good food, and alternative medicine practices such as acupuncture, hypnotherapy, (open to suggestions). Perhaps he’s even willing to try a low-dose of shrooms next year, if he’s allowed to wean himself off such medication, with a supportive environment.


Nobody within our friend group knows anybody who has had experience at a mental health review panel. We are reaching out to multiple sub Reddit’s, and figured this one may be the best bet at finding somebody who could give insight into the challenges that come interacting with a group of health professionals. Do you have any suggestions? 

His Panel Review will be in next week and any feedback would sincerely be appreciated!",27Sep2020,1
209,"So my problem with trust started when I was about 9-10 years old, my mum and dad were in a terrible position in their marriage and were arguing 24/7, one day my mum and my little brother were heading to the shops and my mum asked me if I wanted to go, I was hesitant at first as she seemed very off that day but she said she would buy me some toys if I went with her and me being the dumb 9-10 year old I was, I agreed and we headed to the shop, all seemed normal until she left the shop and didn’t buy what she promised me she was going to buy, I asked her why multiple times in the car and I didn’t get a response once, she started driving us somewhere I had never seen before, we pulled up in front of this house and she told me and my brother to get out of the car and follow her into the house so we did, she walked us into the house, handed over some suitcases to a stranger and left, after she left I found out she dropped us off at a care home where kids go when they’re parents are in a difficult position with their relationship, she said she’ll be back once my parents could resolve things however I didn’t see my dad for nearly 2 years and I barely saw my mum over those 2 years as well. I would go to school and cry every morning wondering when I would see both of them again happy like things use to be but everyone in my class would laugh at me. 

Ever since then I wasn’t able to trust anyone apart from 1 person being my little brother as he had to go through the same thing that I did.

It’s been roughly 10 years since that day and I haven’t been able to bond with anyone how I would like to whether that’s as a friendship or a relationship since, I’m always second guessing myself on whether anyone actually means well as I feel they could quite easily turn on me exactly how my mum did. 

If anyone can give me some sort of advice on what I can or should do then it would really mean a lot to me because I know I can’t carry on living how I am but I every time I do try and trust someone I eventually get backstabbed and I go back to square one.",27Sep2020,1

I mean I wasn’t trying to be a dick but it seemed like he complaining to me when we smoked the last few times opposed to venting. And between his ‘interesting’ choice of music and him complaining I got a headache the last few times.Then this is the same guy who wants to listen to metal when we’re smoking and that doesn’t really give me good vibes. I guess I just smoke for a positive experience and he does too... but metal can be a bit too much.

I vented about this guy on another forum and this guy was accusing me of not caring about him and shit. Said my anxiety, my lack of experience with women, blah blah blah something about depression and I shouldn’t be around.

I guess I’m anxious right now because I’m high and this is kind of offensive. No I’m not some easily offended guy, but really dude you gotta attack my character? Sounds like a blow of resentment or something. Maybe some moral high ground crap or something. I’ve been there for the guy. He’s had ideation in the past and I remember being extremely worried.

After that we needed to write a note for our friends and thank them, of course I wrote for my 2 friends. My friends wrote for other classmates, which I didn't mind, but no one wrote for me. I know it's just a small matter but it really affected me alot, so I cried and luckily the tears hid in my mask so no one noticed that i was crying. We also had played a kahoot and everyone gathered around with their friends to play while I just sat there alone.I teared up alot for almost the whole lesson because i kept overthinking about what had happened.

 Every lesson had something negative happened that day. I went back home and broke down because I was already so emotional. I realised how lonely I actually was and no one would care if I disappeared. The times I had been lonely before meeting my friends and just awkwardly following classmates around, the times where I had cried because I felt so goddamn alone and when my friend was suicidal and I felt so guilty because  she felt that we left her out.

Therapy and IOP was the same thing basically. Try to find coping skills or mechanisms to distract our brains for a few minutes. It doesn't really work for me.

Medications don't seem to work, only give me vivid nightmares and bad withdrawls if i don't get my refill on time. I've tried multiple.

230,"(This is actually important in this post) My both parents and my relatives comes from the second largest city in my country but I grew up in a little town a few miles away. I visit that city alot for birthday parties and other things and there was one day my uncle taught me something that changed my life when I was a 8 year old kid. In that city almost everyone is so kind because they just have a unwritten rule really similar to the golden rule. If you are nice to people, they will give the same kindness back. 

So I used this in school in my little town and I have been doing it for a little more than 7 years. I have been kind to people, helped kids I am not familiar with at my school if they fell down from the playground, buy my friends candy at the candy shop and took them with me on trips and organised events. I can't even keep count every time someone called me a kind person. I stood up against bullying even if I looked like a fool and so on. I did everything I could to be a good person and last I digged into information so I could talk about my friends interests. But that changed a week ago. 

I realised everything I have ever done to people was for nothing. I suffer from paranoia but I know this is real and not just my mind fucking with me. All of my friends except one guy have been ignoring me for weeks. I asked numerous times what they did on the weekend or so but none of them answers. I was thinking they just were tired but cmon it can't last for weeks and they are not sad or anything I can tell because I have always been there for them when they were sad or depressed and it reached to a point when I took their mental health before mine. I was feeling terrible on the inside but I felt they were more important than my well being. 

So this year when my biggest inspiration died out of cancer my heart broke and I was feeling terrible. I never could ask her about advice as I usually did on birthday parties. So I came to school the first day not even talking and just stared down at my desk and people looked at me like I was a monster. Like: ""omg what a weirdo he is, he is not being social"" I just don't get it after all the things I have done for my classmates they see me as a weirdo no one wants to get near and I am stuck in that phase. Everyday in school is a disaster for me, people saw me as a monster and they push my limits.

So one day in school I searched on the web for advice on what to do. Every result was the same and it was: they don't deserve you. At this time I am currently watching Breaking bad which I still do. Where the main character Walter White loses his pride and lives in a nightmare. Everything he achieved is for nothing, someone else took his creation and lives their own perfect life without caring about him. And it struck me that I deserve better than a class where every person is the opposite of what I wanted this class to become. We got for example one girl who believes she is so much better than everybody else because she got a boyfriend she have for a day and then go to another because she is not getting enough fame on snapchat and the racist nerdguys who say the N word all the time even if they are the most white person to ever exist. It's just every person is a person I can't stand because they are everything I can't tolerate and so is the entire town. This town is full of shit and it's like a living hell every person is the same, all they do is hate and act tough by being mean on people who doesn't live in their culture. Luckily in this time the grass is greener on the other side. The city where my parents comes from, I am not feeling people are like this. 

To short summarize, I don't deserve this. I have done nothing wrong and still I am the monster. It's like people are saying I wish I had someone like ""they guy in the picture"" and you are the guy. I just don't know what to do, I could kill myself or isolate myself til I am old enough to move away from this piss town. I am feeling terrible and people don't care because it's not about them. But most of all.

I am tired of being the good guy when I get nothing in return. I am gonna stop being nice to people because the people in this town doesn't deserve it.

She lives too far from me so if I just distance ourselves and disappear, she wouldn't know what happened and then she wouldn't be so hurt knowing another of her friends died from suicide.

But that made me really sad because I actually told her that I try to distance her from me so I won't hurt her. And even though she let herself be fooled by me. She and my therapist were the only ones who always stopped me from dying and now I have no one.

248,"DISCLAIMER: I strongly believe I am not at risk of self harm. I have a series of tools in place from years of therapy work that have been useful and effective for me to prevent me from doing regrettable things. Those tools are in use right now, and I am coping with harmful intrusive thoughts and managing to not actually feel a *desire* to harm myself. That being said:

Hey. 

As title says. Grad school is too much in and of itself. Relationship is too much in and of itself. It's like both ask for 70% of everything I got. If I try my absolute best, I'll fall short of both while completely denying myself. 

The only thing I can do these days that gives me unequivocal peace is drink. Videogames used to do that too, but now they're tainted with the guilt of not doing schoolwork at all times, so there goes that.

I don't think I have a drinking problem. My therapist doesn't think I have a drinking problem. I drink 3 times a week tops. Less, on most weeks : twice, once, or not at all. But I'm afraid. What if I end up having a drinking problem in the future?

I really just want to drink my way through this, y'all. I know I'm not good enough to do it all and the only way I could possibly survive it is through (metaphorical) self immolation. I need to burn my own self as the fuel for everything around me not to fall apart. I don't know what to do. All I want is to get a drink, so I can stop the pain and keep working.

That's all. Have a good day, people. I hope your lives are well.",27Sep2020,1
249,"I am seriously concerned about me deteriorating mental condition. I felt that, while anxiety and gender dysphoria were daily struggle, I was outwardly ok. Then I was slapped in the face by the realization that I’m not. one of my closest friends told me that, while on video call with me last night, they knew that I was dissociating, and that I looked as if I hadn’t slept in days.

Rewinding a few weeks; started receiving algorithmic notifications for DID and BPD resources on sites like Instagra and YouTube. Obv not an indicator of anythin, I ignored it. After a bit it got intriguing, so I looked into it. descriptions of the experiences/symptoms of these conditions are quite similar to what I experience. Of course, a lot of that is my own confirmation bias, I pay it no heed.

then the aforementioned friend contacts me. I have spent my whole day thinking about this, mulling it over. I’m not some guy who self diagnoses based on no research, who thinks that these kinds of things are cool or quirky. But I do think it important that I look into this, even for my own piece of mind.

now of course there’s no resource that equates to real life diagnosis, it would be disrespectful of me to insinuate that, but unfortunately seeking professional help with this one is nigh on impossible. I don’t wish to be disrespectful, or in any way cheapen someone’s struggle/condition, and I don’t believe I have either of these condition. I would just like to know if there are any online resources that might help put my mind at rest, or expose some of the issues I need to face.

I feel like depression is mostly about hope. At least for me. Let me explain. Whenever I have thoughts of self-harm or even ending it all, it always starts as a feeling of futility and hopelessness. But here’s the thing: feeling like nothing will ever change is in my opinion false because life itself is so dynamic, unpredictable and chaotic that it is actually very improbable that things won’t ever change. 

I also say that as a physicist (just finished graduate and starting PhD) - it is impossible to have a system with no changes. Life will always change. Things will always change and as long as time moves forward there is hope.

264,"Hello,

From a very young age (around 7) I've made it my responsibility to make my mom happy. We live with an extremely emotionally abusive father who's the only source of income. Mom isolated herself from family and friends because of my fathers orders. so I decided to be her only friend and to compensate for what she had to go through from being forced to marry my father to this daily humiliation. Therefore, I was never shielded from the abuse myself. I hated how useless I was so at least I can listen to her problems.

As time passed, my father became less abusive, and you can say we've become somewhat a normal family. My mother has friends and freedom and there's no more fights.

However, I started to notice how bad my mother treats me.

1. She's (and her actions are) misogynistic, but would never admit it
2. Puts her feelings above everything else related to me
3. She only spends time with me if she needs to vent about something, specially if it's related to my father.
4. Overly critical of everything I do
5. whenever I try to communicate she screams, cries, and storm off. even when the matter is so simple.
6. she never cares about my feelings or what I have to say as she always interrupts me when taking about ANYthing
7. She always gives me dirty looks and never smile to me

There's many things I didn't mention.

What hurts me the most is that my younger brother (who was always protected from the emotional abuse in the house) is never treated that way by her. Not even my father is.

I've designed my whole life to provide a financially independent future for her and I'm currently a medical student only for this reason.

I can't get rid of the gloom in my life or stop this feeling of guilt and fear of her screaming at me. whenever I try to stand up for myself or explain what i go through she makes sure to make a scene so my dad would get involved and obviously hurt me.

I'm at a stage where I want to be happy, and I can see things from a better prospective. still I wonder:

* How can I stop feeling responsible for everyone happiness around me when no one would do the same?
* How can I stop being so sensitive to her mood and anxious all the time?
* How can my happiness be independent of hers?
* How can I rebuild my own life/ emotions?

I unfortunately cannot afford therapy and so I would appreciate some practical tips.",27Sep2020,1

My ex isolated me from everyone (even my parents, locked myself in my room on my fathers bday) and would hit me if I’d talk to boys. I was allowed one friend only and that’s cause she was super geeky ( he didn’t want me to socialise because he thought he’d lose me). I was super under confident and lonely. That made me develop a lot of issues. After dating on off for two years, he broke up with me saying nothing really and that’s why i have pretty major abandonment and trust issues. After a few weeks, I started dating someone else. He was super nice but He wasn’t expressive and that would make me think maybe i was the problem, maybe I’m not ‘fun’ ‘hot’ enough. This second guy and I dated for more than a year. Another week or two later, my forst ex boyfriend came back begging and i took him back. He broke up with me again because i was asking him not to ghost me and reply to my messages. After a week, I started dating my now boyfriend who is my entire world and I am his. I’m his first girlfriend and I’ve never been loved more. I’m super grateful for him but my trust issues are destroying our relationship.

271,"So my trust issues started when I was about 9-10 years old, my mum and dad were in a terrible position in their marriage and were arguing 24/7 and it wasn’t healthy, during their time arguing, my mum and my little brother were heading to the shops and my mum asked me if I wanted to go, I was hesitant at first as she seemed very off that day but she said she would buy me some toys if I went with her and me being the dumb 9-10 year old I was, I agreed and she drove us to the shop, all seemed normal until she left the shop and didn’t buy what she promised me, I asked her why multiple times and I didn’t get a response during the entire car journey, she started driving us somewhere I had never seen before, we pulled up in front of this house I didn’t recognise and she told me and my brother to get out of the car and follow her into the house, so we did, she walked us into the house and handed over some suitcases she must of pre-packed before we got into the car, she passed them over to a stranger I had never met before and left shortly after she left I found out she dropped us off at a care home where she said she would be back to pick us up once my mum and dad could resolve things between themselves, I didn’t see my dad for nearly 2 years and I barely saw my mum over those 2 years as well.

Ever since then I wasn’t able to trust anyone apart from 1 person being my little brother as he went through the same experience as me and we learnt to stick by each other during that rough period.

I haven’t been able to bond with anyone how I would like to whether that’s as a friendship or a relationship since I’m always second guessing myself on whether anyone actually means well, I feel they could quite easily destroy that trust I have for them exactly how my mum did all those years ago. There’s never been a moment where I haven’t had a thought in the back of my head that people will switch on me and backstab me as that happened throughout my schooling life.

If anyone has advice on what I can do to trust people again I would be more than happy to listen. To be honest it’s destroying any chance I have at building something between people like I mentioned before and It’s quite tiring to me mentally.

Really shy and introverted let's me think and observe things allot and holy shit its fucking sad. The only girl who ever liked me a was a slightly overweight girl in middle school that I didnt feel the same for.

I don't know what it truly is, but I saw something a bit ago about an ADHD episode and am not sure if that is what this is, I can find 0 information on it at all. I recently got my ADHD diagnosis along with a few others, and feel overwhelmed. Everything is frustrating right now, I'm really irritable, and simply freaking out. I'm restless, etc. Sorry if nothing is coherent, or if this is horribly formatted (it doesn't help that I'm new to reddit). Somebody please help me understand what's happening right now. I can't handle it.",27Sep2020,1

280,"I hope I've phrased my question correctly. Also, this might be a bit long since I want you to understand my background and the context.

I'm a marketing student and recently learned about Maslow's hierarchy of human needs. Basically it's a psychological theory represented as a 5-step pyramid that ranks different kinds of human needs from the bottom (most important) to the top. After learning about it, I started thinking about my own life and reached a realization.

I grew up in an Asian culture where your career and education is the only thing that matters in life, and typically your parents expect you to fulfill their vision and expectations for your life.

In my case, my vision and attitude toward life was different from my parents. So since high school, I have always tried to assert my  preferences and build my future how I wanted it i.e. what to study for my Bachelor's, what kind of job I want to do, higher education, etc. Therefore I was in a constant ideological and emotional battle, especially with my dad, for the last 10 years (until I moved to Europe for my Masters in 2019).

It was especially bad during 2017-18 when I had taken a job that he pushed me for, and I couldn't leave because of the pressure. I was depressed and felt lonely in this fight. No friends I could turn to, and no partner. I do have an elder brother who I would talk to and it helped, but it didn't change the situation.

Anyway,  time went by and after a year, I quit that job to pursue my interests. I  found a great internship and afterward started looking for a Master's course abroad. Once again, this was met with opposition and anger from my dad's side, as this didn't fit his vision. I pushed through, got admitted and moved out.

So  basically, throughout my teenage years and young adulthood, every decision that I wanted to make had to have his approval, and I never felt an ounce of support from him. My mother and my brother  understood/understand me better, but it was always a struggle with 'the man of the house'. I grew up learning how to hide my feelings and emotions as a result.

Now, the whole realization thing I mentioned before wasn't caused just by learning about the pyramid. Since the last few months, I cannot help but feel the need to have someone next to me emotionally and physically. You see, for so many years, I felt lonely in my struggles and had no shoulder to cry on and let my emotions out. I was my own guide, leader  and comforter.

I feel like there's just this missing piece - of not having someone beside me. A few days ago I realized that I have a crush on this girl at university, but I  think she has a boyfriend, although I don't know for sure how serious they are. In any case, I will respect her and not pursue it from my side if she's not interested. Before this, I had a massive crush on a girl in high school that went on for years without me telling her. When I  finally did, she said she wasn't interested. It bummed me out for a  while but I just moved on with life.

I have been patient, waiting for the day I meet the right girl and it clicks. I have been working on self-improvement and growth. In fact, I  even feel proud of myself overall for coming this far in life. I have my hobbies and by the way, to lead a championship of your favorite hobby feels awesome. But again, thinking about the girl at university just makes me sad and feel empty. I've felt lonely for most of my young adult life, and I really long to be with someone someday. Just the wait feels agonizing.

I know this might look like a 'forever alone' rant, and you might not have any advice for me. But I do feel a bit better by writing about it. Still, let's see if someone has something to say.",27Sep2020,1

282,"For example, I don’t like school and I often complain about it’s. But, always, in the back of my mind I keep thinking “ People have it worse than you, you don’t even work as hard as others” “Even if the system wasn’t fucked you still wouldn’t learn anything” etc. I dunno, just wanted to know if I wasn’t the only one",27Sep2020,1
