1,"Because all my problems just aren't that severe. And I feel like they are so not severe, that they would probably just go away if I stopped worrying about it.

It's so hard to sit here and type it all out because there's just so much. I had a 8 day long headache after an exam, which I'm almost 99% sure that it was caused by the stress of the exam. Why can't I just stop stressing about things? Just stop worrying?

And I only feel like I'm worrying about things, when I'm thinking about worrying about worrying about things. It's really fucking dumb. And I'm doing so good otherwise.

Things like grades. I get super good grades. Absolutely top grades. So I don't even have anything to be stressed about?

I don't know what to do about it. Everything only seems like a problem because I'm making it a problem.",31Oct2020,1
2,"I feel like a horrible friend. I am close with someone who I used to talk to for hours each day. However, recently I’ve become really stressed with school and life and family/friendship matters. I am stressed, exhausted, and just want to shut down and take a break from everything and being online all the time. However, this person is becoming significantly upset with me and holding a grudge against me since I want to focus on myself and my life. Am I a bad friend if I don’t want to necessarily put things aside to be there for them and if I want to focus on my school first? How do I get them to understand this?",31Oct2020,1
3,"Hi,
My ex girlfriend and I dated for 4 months and she dumped me about a month ago because she has struggled with body dysmorphia and eating disorder(s) in the past and our relationship was causing her to relapse. She didn't tell me anything about her body dysmorphia or eating disorder(s) until she broke up with me and when she told me she didnt tell me the severity or type she struggles with, she also told me I'm the first person she's ever told bar her family I presume. She told me she never lost feelings for me but she can't be in a relationship right now and as she can only see me romantically she doesn't want to see or talk to me at all. We didnt have an unhealthy relationship at all and would talk about things thoroughly if either of us were upset over something but I can see how she must have found it stressful as she felt she couldnt talk about her body dysmorphia and eating disorder(s) with me. I see her commenting on pictures of her on Instagram saying she looks fat and also changing one of her online names to even include ""big"" and ""fat"" in it. I'm really worried about her but reluctant to reach out to her as she made it clear to me she doesn't want that. If anyone can advise me or give me insight to what she's going through it would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks",31Oct2020,1
4,"Its been about a year now since I've been suffering from anxiety to the point of where I decided to seek medical help. I was diagnosed with GAD, so Since dec of 2019 I have been one Lexapr (made me sick), Prozac (20mg, 40mg) effexor (37mg, 75mg, 150mg). My primary care even perscibed Xanax for those really rough days (0.25 mg) which did absolutely nothing. I ended up switching from dosages due to the SSRIs working and then no longer helping. I reached out to a professional who specializes in anxiety disorders among other things. She diagnosed me with severe anxiety and has started me on viibryd (10mg), and Buspar (5mg) and is tampering me down off of effexor while doing so.I've been reading reviews on these medications and they both have a mix of good bad and awful. I took my first dose tonight! Anyone else take buspar or viibyrd? Or both together?

I will update this post as I go through my journey as well.",31Oct2020,1

6,"Since COVID-19 hit, like many many many others I've struggled mentally. Something that I've noticed that happens to me only happens very rarely. I've realised that if I get some particularly bad news that panics me, or that really makes me worry, I feel like I sort of close in on myself, it feels like lots and lots of bad thoughts and worst case scenarios all come into my head at once so I cant process them and it feels like I can't single one out, I can't concentrate on one. I feel like I almost seperate from my body or I feel like a different person, I become angry and frustrated and just overall really really panicky and on edge and I can't see outwards from myself if that makes sense, like I can't really concentrate on anything around me. I need to stress this all happens together and is over very quickly, often I havs a bit of a headache after.
I'm asking because this just happened to me again, it doesn't happen often and I'm always left feeling like I've completely overreacted after, and a bit tired and with a headache. I would call it a panic attack but I don't have any of the classic symptoms of a panic attack, and I would Google it but I have no idea how to describe it!",31Oct2020,1
7,"I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety almost my entire life. A major reason is my mom and all the emotional shame and neglect I’ve dealt with from her.
Wearing makeup was shameful, too much time talking with my dad, not enough energy to do things spur of the moment ( I have 12 chronic illnesses and pain), shamed for PTSD caused by anaphylactic reaction she caused and didn’t apologize for but played dumb about, shamed for needing help moving furniture. 

I’ve tried for so many years to have logical, rational conversations with her about big issues just trying to find peace and resolve things. But every time she would blow up and start yelling, trying to pull me into a screaming match and then would turn it around onto other things so there’s no resolution. 
I’ve been going to counseling for years for CPTSD and talk therapy and really trying to own my own shit and take responsibility. I believe there are things I need to do better at, but for decades now I just couldn’t figure out why my mom and I can’t have rational conversations using cognitive behavioral therapy. She’s made me feel like all our relationship issues were my fault. 

In the last three months I was watching a medical show where they described narcissism in a way I’d not heard before. I was shocked and started crying because it fit my mom to a T. I felt like I’d been given a gift. I’m a nurse but hadn’t heard narcissism laid out as thinking like you are the only one in the world who cares so deeply about helping people. So much so that you feel you have to do it all like staying busy until you drop and neglect your family and children and self...because no one else in the world is going to be as kind to them as you would. 

I’ve now been researching and realizing my mom is a true narcissist, or a “communal narcissist” and damn good at hiding it. I’ve been watching YouTube videos by Lisa A Romano and others as they describe how to combat narcissists and deal with their verbal assaults. 
This is the first time in my life I’ve had peace about myself and not felt shame about who I am. I’m finally realizing that all the fights I had growing up with her were due to her narcissism and the fact that she couldn’t handle my emotional intelligence surpassing her own. 
Ive hated myself for years, felt guilty whenever I was given nice things or taken on a trip or allowed to have something my mom couldn’t. She would send me letters telling me how jealous she was of me, and I felt I deserved it. A few times she got my brother to call me with her to tell me how worried they were at the kind of person I was becoming. The constant judgment and shame was deep and harsh. 

I’ve moved away from her now and had already been cutting off contact by blocking her on social media and by phone. I haven’t spoken to her in over 6 months and it’s the first time I’ve started to feel good about myself. 

I would never have thought to look into this mental health diagnoses because she comes across as a very loving and outgoing person who gives to everyone. But behind closed doors she turns into a witch and feeds off of the energy of a fight. 
Anyways, I’m not saying everyone is a narcissist now, but if you’re struggling with feelings of shame, neglect, wondering why you don’t feel good enough, feel controlled by a parent/spouse or friend I highly urge you to look into this. I’m finally on my way to healing with the help of my mental health counselors and the right medication. Arming myself with the truth and information has been a huge help too. 

I wish I’d known about this sooner but I’m so grateful for knowing it about it at all. 
I was literally questioning my sanity because the things she would accuse me of didn’t make sense logically. We could never get through a conversation and go from point A to B because she would distract and manipulate. Classic statements were like: “why is it always about you?”, “you’re always so negative”, “We already talked about this in the past, can’t you leave it in the past” (but it’s not ever resolved). 

Anyways, I hope this helps someone because I feel like a million pounds has been taken off my shoulders and that I now know I’m not crazy. She’s got a mental health issue that’s dangerous and I can’t be around her without having strong set boundaries. I’ve learned that I can’t ever talk with her about this, it won’t get me anywhere and will only feed the fire. So I just have to be ok with knowing myself. 
Trust yourself and if you feel like someone is manipulating you, talk to a friend or write down what it is they’re doing a ask a mental health professional. 
Wish you all the best and happy mental health!",31Oct2020,2
8,"To cut it short for everyone.

I was in a supermarket tonight, a lady repeatedly was looking at me up and down so I got frustrated and asked if we had a problem. She then had a burst moment of shouting at me saying I went past her too close and not 2 metres distance. I responded and said apologies but not to worry I am wearing a facemask too. She responded in an attacking way again so I lost my temper and retaliated and said some rude things, her husband then stepped in and threatened me, so again I retaliated and shouted abuse back. I have never had such a moment of rage before, once I left and got back in my car I felt bad, even though I didn't start it. I kept thinking about it and it has now been 4 hours and the situation that happened feels like a complete blur. I can hardly make out what was said and what everything looked like. Why could this be, is this my brain protecting me, or rather shielding the 'trauma' (?)

Tl;dr. Burst of rage after being threatened, now can hardly remember what happened after 4 hours.

Anyone know why this may be?",31Oct2020,1
9,"(Apologies for mobile) 

So I'm in New England right now, it's starting to get dark really early and I think the seasonal depression is starting to set in. I work part time while doing my online classes for college. Ironically, school hasn't stressed me out that much lately so that's nice. And recently work has actually helped as a distraction and kept me with a schedule, although it is tiring. 

My sister is in between jobs right now and she has a lot of payments to make so I'm really worried about her. I'm in a position where it's really hard to save money cause of gas and food so having to provide for my sister right now is a little stressful (I'm a broke college student lmao). 

Now on to the biggie. There's this guy that I've been hanging out with and the situation is really odd. It was dumb and I'll never do it again. But we had decided since we weren't really super compatible and that we have different goals, we wouldn't pursue a future together in that way. And at some point we had discussed exclusivity because we had only been seeing each other. But then we decided to not do that anymore. Which at the time I was like whatever idc, I'm not planning on finding other people to sleep with. But I made the mistake of thinking that he wouldn't either. 

Fast forward to this week. He tells me that he has a friend visiting this weekend so I couldn't come over. I was a little bummed because it's Halloween so now I'm pretty much just going to work and then do school work instead. But then on Wednesday I was having a hard night (suicidal ideation ish not thinking of doing it just being very tired with life). So I messaged him to see if he was still awake and he called me. I told him about why I was crying cause he kept asking, I really just didn't want to be alone with my thoughts when I didn't have to. Anyway, shortly after in that same conversation THAT was when he decided to tell me that the friend who is visiting, is a girl. And I was like...okay? That's fine...But I knew there was a reason he was saying that. So I asked ""are you guys going to fuck?"" And he said ya. At first I was like okay whatever, we're not in a relationship blah blah blah whatever. 

But then the next day it kept nagging at me and I ended up having a panic attack at work. Then today I had another one about an hour before work. We argued a bit and I just don't like how he looks at it. I explained to him why I was getting upset and he just didn't seem to give a shit. I feel like even tho it technically isn't cheating or anything, it's still shitty and feels wrong. Idk it makes me feel like I'm being pushed aside and used. I just idk the whole thing sucks and I'm angry with myself for getting into this situation. Because to me the loss of exclusivity meant that like he'd probably still be using dating apps (although he said a few times that he wasn't using them for the mean time), and that if he did meet someone they'd go out on a date. But the friend that's visiting is an old friend from when she went to school up here. Apparently they've had sex before so he's assuming that they'll have sex now. But that it's just casual and he's not going to date her. So to me it doesn't make sense. He's also said before that I'm not allowed to go fuck another guy, but I can fuck a girl. AND he said in that phone conversation that if I went and fucked another guy he'd feel a little weird. Yet he can't understand why I feel weird about this. So ya I'm a dumbass...anywho",31Oct2020,1

12,"Just curious if anyone can relate or explain why I am like this .  So every week or so I'll have a night where my mind really lights up and I start making all sorts of crazy connections.  On occasion I'll even get up to write down some of my thoughts, though  I can't type fast enough to capture it all.  

Interspersed with real insight is also a lot of gibberish or random thoughts.  There'll be many voices, interesting images, stories unwinding and everything colliding and coalescing together.  It's almost self-generating.  If I read something interesting it sets my mind going on and on drawing out endless associations because I need to reach completion. It's a weirdly euphoric  high--like I am some sort of detached God.  Then the next day I feel all worn out and tired.

On a possibly related note, I'm also super sensitive to the effects of alcohol in both positive and negative ways.  If I have one beer it makes me super euphoric and focused but then I'll be very lethargic and depressed for sometimes up to a week.",31Oct2020,1

Before quarantine I had goals and tasks, but now I have finished all of the possible one. And now I feel the life has stopped to me, I sit at home, doing nothing, feel myself useless. I dont communicate with others of my age, because it always has been hard to me to find ones, and as seen I lose them quickly. I'm tired of nothing, day after day seems the same, I tried learning/exercising but after two months I stopped because I missed one day. I tried to 'color' the days by doing DIY, didn't worked well. And with all that free time I only think about old days and mostly I remember only the cringe/shameful and mistakes I made and lost opportunities. The parents dont help that much, they get mad, because I'm going insane, and it creates a loophole.

16,"My bad if this doesn’t really fit in the group style of format but I don’t really know where else to post it. I have posted on reddit twice with my original account and only as replies. I normally am not the sharing time, but I figured fuck it I’m already near rock bottom so who gives a shit. I grew up with an intensely fucked family. My mother was an alcohol and would beat me and my brothers and sisters sometimes. But 99% it was me as I was the oldest of the 4 of us. And I would intentionally “aggro” her if you will. She eventually went full insanity and was put in an institution and I didn’t see her for 17 years(I will be 32 in April). I was always in fights with my entire extended family. My uncle used to hit and tease me to try to get me to cry and then belittle me when I did, often. My grandparents would blame me for my outbursts and punish me and it just double downed the issue. My father was a kinda higher up salesman that was always gone and I never developed any kind of relationship with him. I eventually just closed off and because extremely apathetic. Fast forward to today and I now have a partner of 5 years and we have found out I have extremely severe adhd, minor ocd, desperation anxiety, minor general anxiety, chronic depression, CPTSD, and possibly bipolar. The last three years has been getting harder and harder for us to stay together. My inability to stay tidy and on task is a great contrast to her very orderly and detail oriented personality. I have finally recently started taking adderall, as when I was young my family acted as if any possible ailment was just me making it up/my fault and so I wasn’t diagnosed til I was 29. I’ve always struggled with keeping my self in good spirits by constantly delving into my hobbies or work. Distraction defends from the madness one might say. But today it really hit me, I am going to be dealing with  this shit for the rest of my entire life, and it’s not exactly motivating to keep going. I won’t do anything drastic as I care too much about my partner(although I have in the past but in secret and no one knows). I also just cut myself off from my entire social circle as I realized I was just perpetuating my past family and they were all toxic selfish pricks. Never have time to help or compliment me, but always there to berate and ask for help. I also have started drinking, HEAVILY when I do. About 2-3 times a month I’ll chug a 5th of vodka and just cry for like 5 hours and puke. I’m a big guy at 6’4 225lbs and I’m also a heavy weight so I barely even get a hangover the next day, but it feels like it’s the only way I am able to vent. Everyone around me says I am always unflappable. I never ever panic in life or death situations, it often doesn’t even elevate my heart rate and I used to be kind of an adrenaline junky with motocross and free climbing. Because of my adhd and inability to plan more than a couple days ahead I feel like I’m always swimming in an ocean without ever seeing the shoreline. I can’t have my partner deal with all my stress because she is fairly stressed managing her store. And with Covid I lost my job so I just do stuff around the house and some contracting but it doesn’t bring nearly enough money to be comfortable(yay Cali rent...). I almost deleted this entire post as I already have once from my main account.  I have always had a very strong ability to adapt and learn at a very accelerated pace, but I also struggle in jobs due to them often being too linear and or stagnant for my brain to stay on task. I know I’m rambling and it’s not very well formatted but if I spent the time to do it properly I wouldn’t post. I just feel like no matter what I do it’s always a slog and exhausting. I don’t really get highs, I’m more even toned or apathetic or I’m swollowinf my repressed anger so I don’t explode and cause my partner to be frightened as I did once. I ripped a door off it’s hinges and broke it in several sections with my head and then threw it through a wall, oops... Oh I almost forgot the to mention the other “benefit” my gene pool gifted upon me, celiacs disease! I guess the one upside is my psychiatrist said “You’ve done an outstanding job, and I’m impressed you are able to function going so long without treatment!” Although I think it was more “existing” than really functioning. Thanks for reading my desperation fueled ramble. Oh, most people around me that aren’t specifically just my partner think I’m ALWAYS level headed and have a good sense of humor. I tend to be pretty funny I guess, when ya know, not falling apart like a bmw lacking basic maintenance.


TLDR: Unfortunate upbringing, lost all my friends recently who were toxic, no job due to covid, learned I have a buttload of mental baggage and illness that will weigh me down forever(I knew to a degree, I’m fairly self aware), and health issues.

PS. I am literally impossible to offend, especially when being more introspective so you do not need to watch your words. I tend to know what peeps mean not what they say.",31Oct2020,1

In the summer when the sun starts to go down later around 8pm I’m comfortable and normal. But in winter when it starts to go down around 5 or 6pm I just get so depressed. It’s been this way for years. I’m bipolar but even before I started showing signs of it I had this. Depression has always been there it’s persistent but something about the sun going down much earlier and it being dark and gloomy really messes with my brain chemicals.

I know they struggle with the thoughts of life such as I, but why must that foul firing line be pointed at me? I do not spark joy in the lives of those I love, so why should I care if I'm alive or dead? Why do I care so much? Is it because I feel tolerated where love is supposed to flourish?

Today a teacher I look up to told me she and another 2 teachers discuss about me all the time. Explain what is the difference between “sick leave” and “sickie” (she is an English teacher). And said pulling sickie is an irresponsible act.

To be honest, I know. I think I am terrible too. I hate myself too. I know my class will always have an absentee. I think I'm lazy and irresponsible too. They said “not only responsible for yourself” and I totally agree. 

I've never told anyone I suffered from depression and self-harm. Whenever people ask me, I just said I have doctor appointments regularly. And mostly, I went to school in a pretty good condition. I'm even the funny one in class.

My mum knows, so she is the one who call in sick for me. Actually, she just found out I self-harm lately, so our relationship is kind of intense right now.

That being said, I have great insurance, resources, everything.

TL;DR I'm dreading the process of finding a therapist more than anything. It's a chore, especially around here with limited resources. I can't motivate myself to even begin the process (which from the start will take 3-6 months, so the sooner the better). How do you motivate yourself to take care of yourself?",31Oct2020,1

I always having problem handling my mistakes. Maybe because I'm a perfectionism, I always being hard to myself and not allowing to do any mistakes.

I've been crying since last night until now. I don't know why I can't forgive myself. My therapist told me that I need to lower down my expectation. So that I will not be heartbroken if something doesn't go the way that I wanted but I don't know how to do that.

32,"As someone who suffers from depression and anxiety I know sometimes it come come off a rude or careless. When I was in a dark place I didn’t care about anything in the world. All I saw was negativity. I realized this was an unhealthy mindset and it’s kind of scared because if I didn’t care about my own life, how would I compassion for others people’s well being. So now I don’t judge anybody for their mistakes. I believe everyone who does something bad is because they are in a bad place mentally. Even if they are psychopaths, I don’t condone what they do but because they are not capable of being good people. Like an animal who was rabies, they become violent and sometimes left untreatable. The point is I saw a video about Chris watts, a man who killed his wife and children to be with another woman. Everyone in the comments called him a monster, trash, and deserve to be executed. I don’t blame them for their strong feelings, there’s nothing more despicable I can think of than a man who kills his own family for his momentary gain and deserves full punishment of the law. However, I have to question how bad of a place mentally does he have to be to think the only way out of his unhappiness is to make his family disappear. This guy was in need of serious help. If he ever feels remorse for what he did, I can’t what imagine what he’ll awaits full of immense guilt and regret. My day gets ruin when I lose my temper at my family member when they critique my driving, I can’t imagine what this guy will go through if he ever feels regret at all.

I’m a senior in HS. I never had any friends. I’ve been ostracized/bullied in HS and elementary school. I always went to guidance, asking for help. They said “wait till college.”

College was supposed to be a new start for me. Friends. Independence. A different life. But it won’t happen if Covid is still around. I talk to some kids in college right now and they hate it. And it doesn’t look good for me. I wanted to swim in college, but I haven’t been to a pool in 7 months. I didn’t have any friends before lockdown, now it’s nobody still. I don’t want to waste my youth.

38,"Apologies in advance if I seem a bit all over the place in my writing, while my ADHD medication does wonders to help me focus and organize my thoughts it also tends to make me try multitasking a few too many things at once. Between that and mobile formatting I'll do my best to not jump between topics or points too erratically.

Long before I ever knew that ""mental health"" or ""mental illness/disability"" were things people worried about, I was struggling with them all the same. I don't remember when I first felt this knot of ever-present anxiety form in my gut, but I know I was very young. Too young to realize the cruel irony in noticing the knot form, immediately thinking ""I hope this goes away soon, it's not very comfortable"" and the knot getting bigger and more uncomfortable in response to that thought.

Looking back now, I can see pretty clearly what caused it in the first place and made it a self-sustaining beast that has always made even my best moments seem...just a bit off. As a child, my mother and I had the kind of relationship that would make Tom and Jerry seem like best friends, if not lovers. My dad once told me he watched her purposely push my buttons and back me into a corner (figuratively speaking) until I was so unbelievably angry I probably couldn't see straight, only to walk away with a smile on her face like she was proud of herself.

My older sister, whom I no longer stay in contact with, started weighing in on these arguments, fights, or whatever else they became. She was never involved in the first place; she just decided to take umbrage with the fact that I was fighting with our mother, rush to her (completely unnecessary) rescue, and subsequently unknowingly push me further into the depths of anxiety and depression I had already inherited genetically.

Then, middle school happened. That dreaded part of our school days that most people will say they prefer not to talk about with a laugh before changing the subject. I'm sure there will always be details I won't know about how and why this happened, but as far as I've figured it all out...well, somehow a 6th grader getting so severely depressed that they just shut down got me diagnosed with very high-functioning Asperger's Syndrome.

To this day, I question whether that diagnosis was at all correct or just a hot pile of garbage. I see points supporting both sides, and leave it at ""inconclusive.""

But this diagnosis, as well as having shut down so completely from depression that I essentially failed the 6th grade, got me enrolled in a special education program for kids with autism at a different middle school. Apparently, switching schools for that program was the only reason I ""passed"" 6th grade.

But then it wasn't being made fun of by the other kids that was an issue. The staff running that special ed program were the problem.

I still remember tons of stories that serve as examples of this, and I know even more got subconsciously pushed out of my memory entirely; I assume as a kind of defense mechanism. But when the head of such a program, designed to help kids that need it, calls every student in the program out of their classes to try and cover up how they're basically yelling at the one student telling their parents about the questionable-at-best methods they employ...well, I hardly think it's difficult at all to see how I was suicidal then. The one and only time I ever was.

For the record, I was the student tattling on those sorry excuses for mental health workers. I got suicidal because no matter how much I told my parents and anyone else I could, nothing ever changed. And that bullshit meeting they called was just as poorly handled; the head of the program tried being vague with her wording (""SOME of you have been...""). The fact that she couldn't stop glaring at me while she told ""us"" to knock it off and let them do their jobs told me everything I needed to know, even then.

The program continued into high school, but with completely different staff. By the time I was a senior, every time my freshman year came up I would start apologizing profusely to the high school program staff. I felt so bad that, by no fault of their own, they had gotten such a messed up kid that wanted nothing more than the numbness and pain to be gone. But with their help and more patience on their part than I've ever seen before or since, I graduated high school more more or less, for lack of a better word, healed. I had beaten my demons, and sworn to myself and God and anyone else listening that I would always do everything in my power to not only hold them back and keep them dormant, but to do the same for everyone else around me as best as I could. If I only helped myself then at least I had tried and I could go to sleep that night with no regrets.

Seven years after that, I finally got my four year degree from college. It didn't matter to me that I had had to take fewer credits per semester than almost everyone else, I'd found a way that worked for me and I kept climbing higher. I got a well-paying job in my field. I started DJ'ing at anime conventions I went to every year. I was even a guest at one such convention, the main stage DJ for Saturday night three years in a row. Every time, if I could make it happen, I hosted a panel about mental health and beating your inner demons. My own personal take on the It Gets Better project, as I saw it. I didn't, and still don't, think anyone should have to feel the way I did for so long. And through it all, after so many years and so much nonsensical pointless pushing of my buttons for no reason, I finally started having a decent relationship with my mother. Nothing like what either of us would have wanted in a perfect world, but compared to what it had been it was beyond perfect.

But then...something happened that I never thought I'd have to worry about. The demons came back.

My employer at the time told me to my face that my mental health and my work performance were, apparently, ""two separate issues"" as their justification for basically putting me on thin ice permanently.

Didn't make much sense when I was a software engineer.

In an instant, all the safety nets I'd built to stop myself from any kind of relapse just kind of vanished without a trace. I went back to my desk and had a panic attack so severe I couldn't even make out shapes, just a swirling blur of colors. It was the worst panic attack I've ever endured, and when it finally subsided enough for me to think again it had been 30 minutes.

I wound up quitting for my own sake, even though I know they were in the wrong and I could have waited for them to fire me to ""explain"" that to them. I struggled to find any kind of employment after that, in my field or otherwise, that didn't immediately terrify me at the drop of a hat. After nearly a decade of trying to show my older sister - who had always seemed convinced that I would always be who I was as an 8-year-old - that she should really give me a second chance (and doing so by actions instead of words no matter what), she waited for her ""perfect moment"" to tell me that all my efforts meant nothing to her. It took maybe 15-20 seconds, and I haven't kept in touch with her since. I decided in that instant that she's anything but an elder sibling, and if she ever decides to be an adult for once and try talking to me then she knows where to find me. Until then, I wash my hands of her and her high school levels of drama nonsense.

I got dragged into a toxic relationship that held me in that dark place I suddenly found myself in again. The fact that the problems started with her expecting me to fix every ""problem"" she brought up but refused to do the same for me even at the beginning should have spurred me into action...but it didn't. I was too far gone, too broken. It was like being, for lack of a better term, ""partially suicidal"" - I had no thoughts of hurting myself or taking my own life, but that feeling of ""I just don't want to hurt anymore"" had never been stronger in my life.

And now, roughly four years later...I'm beating the demons back again. It's been a much longer fight than it was in middle and high school, and it's been much harder getting the help I need to really get my life back on track, but I'm finally getting there again. I'm actually happy most days. I have four dogs, three ESAs and one service dog in training, without whom I don't know where I'd be right now. I'm starting to livestream on Twitch more frequently again, and I'm actually getting close to Affiliate (which would be amazing to reach since I was let go from my last job about 1.5 weeks before everything went into lockdown and haven't found a new job since).

I know it's a lot to read (and to write!), but I guess the TL;DR here is...never give up. You may have to ask for help you don't want to, or fight back for a lot longer than you should need to, or whatever else may come. I've had to change my dreams and goals, temporarily or otherwise, countless times these last 4 years. But you can beat your demons, just like I did. And if they come back, you can do it again.

Life is like a masterpiece painting to me: to truly be something spectacular, you've got to use some darker colors here and there. Don't get absorbed with how dark it might be here or there - use those parts of your life to push yourself to new heights. It's never easy, but as I'm learning for the second time right now it's more than worth it in the end. You CAN do this.

And this community will be there to help you get back up and try again whenever you need it. For all those here that have done that for me, thank you from the bottom of my heart and I want you to know I'm doing everything I can to pay it forward. :3",31Oct2020,1

For as long as I can remember I can’t be around people for a super long time without getting some time to myself cause i feel agitated and need my own space because I start to feel crazy and overwhelmed! I also get super angry when there’s loud startling noises or people are yelling and in school I could never focus on reading when there was any other noise going on like tapping pencils etc. It would take everything in me to not start yelling at everyone to shut up even tho there was barely any noise. I’ve also always been the WORST procrastinator i’ve ever seen and I hate it so much! Also, since I was about 16 (when i started birth control) I would get super depressed from time to usually around the winter months and then i’d forget about it. during this time I had a boyfriend who I would cry to and call when i felt like I had no one else but he would act like I was crazy and say things like “are you seriously crying again” which made me feel like I didn’t actually have a problem and that I didn’t actually need help even though I had suicidal thoughts. and it got better once i switched to a different form of birth control. flash forward to january 2019 when he broke up with me a week before we were going to move in together (thank god) and i started getting panic attacks and lots of anxiety! which had never happened before that and ive struggled with it since but it has gotten better. Within the last couple of weeks i’ve been getting a lot of intrusive suicidal thoughts like when i’m driving i think about crashing etc. But it scares me because i know id never do that but they keep getting stronger to the point where my body almost takes over and does it.

54,"So I fully know this is definitely a side effect of long term emotional neglect. But I just had the weirdest experience that's left me surprisingly panicked.   


My older brother isn't comfortable having us over for Thanksgiving due to Covid and half the family being teachers who have to be in person. My parents are desperate to see everyone in person...but recently proved an unwillingness to wear masks at family gatherings, even when it's requested. It's also the one year anniversary of my younger brother's suicide. Emotions are raw and the pandemic has negatively impacted the healing for us all. Last year, I was left alone on my younger brother's birthday and even chastised for drinking too much after going to my parents' house to babysit their dogs before being asked because they hadn't planned for said dogs when they both went off that day. I was only very lucky a friend agreed to be with me but the chastising occurred in front of him. In previous years, I've been caught in power struggles between my parents and older brother regarding where, when, and how to host Thanksgiving.  


My mother suggested she and my dad would celebrate Thanksgiving alone by going out to eat. My dad said we'd find a solution but nothing's happened. I suggested to my older brother a campout. I'd try to quarantine or Covid test so I could stay in an RV with my parents to camp near my older brother. He and his husband could visit for Thanksgiving dinner outdoors at the campsite then go home. He gets safety and social distancing. They get in person meeting. I don't get left behind/forgotten/caught in the middle of a power struggle.   


My older brother responded that he would sleep on it. That I would not be left behind or forgotten, but that he understood where I was coming from.

That year at 10 my grandparents divorced and I was forced to move in with my alcoholic mother. It was a nightmare and she sunk any self esteem i had into the ground up until I moved out at 14.

I feel like teenagers start to really discover themselves and how they look around puberty age, but at that time I wasn’t able to really figure out what I liked or who I was. 

Everything I did, she criticized, and I would just drop it because I thought it was stupid. 

As a result I’m slightly good at many different things instead of really good at a few, and I have no idea what I’m supposed to look like.

I don’t feel comfortable at any weight, skinny or chubby, and I have no sense of style. How do you become who you’re meant to be after missing that crucial period of development?",31Oct2020,1
60,"I'll say what happend... We were tripping like crazy and I asked if my friend wanted anther cup of magic mushrooms. We weighed it out to 3grams i poured my cup into two cups which he knew about.. I don't remember if I poured some more pieces in his or not I was high asf so I don't don't remember. A thought came into my head at the time as I suffer from ocd so I get intrusive thoughts alot. I honestly don't think I did put more pieces from one cup to anther cup but after he got paranoid it made me question if I did or not. I explained this to Reddit groups and was told I'm a rapist. 

We were both tripping like crazy long before the 3g thing. He drunk it and two seconds after drinking it he tripped out and accused me of putting some more pieces in his drink. Which I don't believe I did. He then threatend to call cops on me and went crazy. He left then and then the next day was just the same. 

At the time he was telling me I did all this stuff and i was high as hell so what I wrote on the original post on reddit was not correct I could barely make out words at the time.  I corrected the post on Reddit afterwards becouse I could barely even write at the time. People are now saying I'm a date raper and honestly this is killing me inside and it making me fall into a very deep depression. We were both extremely high on shrooms so I can't remember shit. All I know is I was being accused of stuff by him and he was saying horrible stuff to me and freaking out while he was tripping. So this shit can ruin my life with people saying I'm a date rapist. I'm not. I'm tired of this. And we were never intimate


I've been in bed all day and suicidal due to the comments people on Reddit have left me that I wrote on a post while I was very high on a trip and wasn't making sense. Even though I edited it the next day and explained I'm being told I'm all these awful things. ...


I need to vent and I want to end my life with what people have been telling me.

So I have always had problems, I started Prozac at 10 years old and moved from citalopram, sertraline, abilify, buspirone (hated that one). Last year I just stopped taking it because I was annoyed at the weight gain and heart palpitations. 

When I was younger I would scream at people and cry and lock myself in the bathroom, and then I would turn right around and cuddle and be inquisitive and loving. They thought I might’ve been autistic or had a learning disability, and they suggested I take an IQ test so they could put me in a special class or something. On the WISC-IV in 2009, I scored a 157 (161 Stanford, 191 Cattell). I didn’t feel smart, necessarily, I just did things and I continue to do them. But I often wish I was ignorant. 

I get frustrated easily, and I began to see a psychiatrist when I was 8 or 9. I was diagnosed with OCD and anxiety, and I could not care less about either one. I have had them talked about for so long that they do not penetrate my mind whatsoever. I had the hand-washing, the rituals, the tapping on both sides, etc. and then moved on to the “late teenage depression stage” at 11-13, isolated myself, stayed in bed all day, etc. Then the romantic failures in high school, self-harm, hospitalization. Now I have hypochondria, which is delightful (/s).

But what I wonder is when I think about what it would be like to hurt other people. I just sit there and think about it, a few times I have dreamt about it. It disturbs me slightly but not enough to really worry. I think about choking/crushing/nail gun murder, etc. and it doesn’t really seem intrusive, it’s just like ok I accept that I am thinking this. Often it is people I am supposed to care about, like someone I’m in charge of looking after or a friend.
The best way I can describe it is like a physical tugging sensation in my mind that happens when I’m frustrated and I want to smother everyone around me. 

I cry way too much and have way too many strong emotions to be a psychopath. Sometimes though I make myself cry because I like the feeling of being sad, and then I get frustrated because I’ve caused a scene or damaged a relationship. I would never really hurt someone, I don’t know why I would and I wouldn’t like the feeling of doing that or seeing someone that is physically hurt. 

I am just wondering about this and if anyone else experiences the tugging part? Of wanting to think about hurting someone or something but not wanting to do it actually. I just feel like I can’t ask a professional irl about this because I would be questioned and I also feel like I am far beyond the scope of getting therapy at this point in my life lol

63,"Over my lifetime when I have met people I have often had a hard time separating them. For example, this past week at my school I had a real good conversation with one of them (he was white, average height, and had dark brown hair). After this conversation, I thought that I was talking to him for a couple of days until I realized that I was talking to an entirely different person who had similar features (average height, white, and dark brown hair). This discovery shocked me, but I didn't say anything, because it would be awkward to tell him that I thought he was someone completely different. This complicates my life quite a bit, because obviously they don't know that I think they are someone different, and frankly until I see them together I don't know that they are different either. The last issue I fear this cause is people to believe that I am racist since I can't easily tell people of different races apart. (I can't even tell my own race apart, lol) However, as a person who loves to see things as half glass full, I have also seen its benefits. For example, I love diversity, because when people are uniquely built, have unique hair color, or are of different races I can easily keep them separate, and therefore have two fully working relationships. Additionally, I have noticed that this makes me more welcoming to the person who I confuse them with because in my mind I have already broken the ice with them. Though, this benefit can also be negative, when I have a negative interaction with one of them. It is very complicated, and I don't know what I can do about it. I have known people for years before realizing that they were two entirely different people... ugh you must think I'm an idiot. When I worked in the retail industry I would often greet a customer after I had already greeted them, because I had completely forgotten what they looked like. But I don't know if that is connected to the same issue. In conclusion, I think I may have partial facial blindness if that is a thing.

Monday was normal, then suddenly i remembered my past, the horrible person i was. i became depressed, suicidal thoughts slowly started to grow, and get stronger with each day. I was a horrible person back then, i have changed so much, almost completely, i was feeling much better and thinking better, but no matter how much i’ve changed, the past is still there. maybe i’ve changed so much, became a much better person, that i now realize how horrible i truly was, and i don’t want to live knowing the person i was before. i’m at a constant battle with myself, throughout the whole day i feel like shit, and for a couple minutes i feel normal. Every time i catch myself smiling or laughing, i instantly stop myself, i tell myself that i don’t deserve to be happy, that i don’t deserve anything. it makes me sad that i’ve gotten this low, i’ve changed so much and it still isn’t enough for me, i’m scared that i will eventually grow the courage to do it. i don’t want to leave my family behind, i’ve grown so much for them, but i’ve hurt them, and i can never forgive myself. i can’t even see myself the same way anymore, even though i know i’ve changed, i just wish the person i was in the past never existed. i’m a completely different person now, that looking back, i can’t believe i was like that. i’ll probably end up calling a hotline today. i can’t think straight, the person i am now can’t handle the memories of the past. even though i don’t have the courage now, i am almost certain i will grow the courage in the future. i’m battling myself, i’m trying to save myself while telling myself that i don’t deserve to be alive. i know that the person i was in the past does not make me who i am today, but i feel like (i know this sounds dumb) i’ve become so much of a better person, that i feel the only choice is suicide, i know there’s more to that, i want to save myself from facing everyone, i can’t look at them in the face without wanting to die. if you read all of this, thank you.",31Oct2020,1

66,"I always thought I was just getting forgetful. I would often wonder why I would forget whenever my parents would be so mean (lol wording it that way as if I wasn’t subjected to so much mental abuse throughout the years) but I only realized recently that it might be a trauma response. 

Earlier today, I woke up and saw my door was a bit open. For context, my parents broke my door twice so they can enter my room a few months back. They didn’t want to leave me alone or respect the fact that I wanted to be alone lol. A week ago, the knob finally gave up. I removed it bc I ended up getting stuck so I stuffed an old shirt through the hole and used a duffel bag full of clothes to keep the door closed without closing it entirely + a rack to conceal myself. 

I had just sprayed bug spray last night and let the spray linger in the room while I was showering bc there were mosquitos from all the times I had to run out to pee and consequently leave my door open. Waking up to the door slightly ajar was the worst feeling ever as I feel like I was transported back to a few months ago when my dad yelled out “I’m going to force open the door” haha. 

The thing is I can’t remember if it was my fault or not, but why would I carelessly leave the door that open especially when I sprayed? The frustrating part is I can’t remember if I did move the rack near the door, or if I forgot to. I set up markers for myself (a row of washi tape on my door which I’ll have to manually tape whenever I go back in + my younger sister volunteered to place our dog’s huge cage over my door to send a message) 

I don’t want to go out right now because I just can’t. I know it’s not worth not eating but I just can’t right now. I still have some snacks and water here though and an arinola for emergencies.

My mind is just playing games with me but I think I know for sure that I didn’t or wouldn’t be stupid enough to leave the door that open especially while my air conditioner is on. I’m feeling much better now that I am venting here, but earlier it was so difficult as so many things came to my mind and I just hate not knowing if my parents were in here or not. I avoid them because I hate everything they’ve done for me and the fact that the virus is still around is so scary. I am so afraid to think that my mom might’ve heard me having another nightmare and went in and touched my face or something. 

My mom has always had a problem with me not wanting to be touched and I’m seething right now just remembering it. I’m so afraid thinking that she might’ve heard me yell so she thinks we’re in some soap opera and decided to just go in.

All I want is privacy and because of the open door I have so much more fear now. Fear of the virus fear of being touched and just general anger for them to still not respect that I want to be alone after years and years of torment. 

The whole story is just long and I do feel the need to explain more bc I was also traumatized when I tried to seek help online. The counselor was gaslighting me and giving me unsolicited advice but I think Reddit would be more supportive or at least professional.

So today my brother and I talked about a situation we had when we were angry. He said that my mother doesn’t know how to raise a man, and I believe that he is right. My mom said that I was a soft person, which I hate being called anything related to being a coward. Since i walked out of the room while we had an altercation, he mentioned that I shouldn’t be a “bitch, a pussy, or that I have a pussy between my legs.” Funny I know, but then he talks about how often and graphically talked about having sex with women, because my mom can’t teach me that and he’s right. We eventually made up, but it dawned on me for a bit, and now it’s making me so frustrated. How I a coward and I can’t get a woman, I’m a virgin and I think I know the reason why. It honestly makes so frustrated that I’m having mixed feelings about everything. My mom called me soft and a pussy at one time and my brother doing the same quite a few times. I love them to death, but when they say that about or to me, it really messes with me and I don’t know how to deal it. I tried calming down but those thoughts come back again and I get angry some more.

I don’t know what to do and I’m seriously all over the place right now.

Nah point being I don’t want these symptoms I wish I could just focus yet I can’t, good news I’m with the good half and want help, but now I’m in my senior year and might not pass because I’m stuck at home where it’s impossible for me to focus, I really do think medication would help me but the issue is many places won’t prescribe stimulants, and the ones that do are out of my price range, really my only hope is finding a loop around because patient first can act as primary care doctors and they can both diagnose and prescribe medication and their in my price range, thanks America.

I’ll end up staying up til I have to start the next day, i can sometimes stay up days at a time and feel really good about how much I accomplish.  

 often when people are talking, sounds, textures of blankets and other random things irritate me. badly. Like to the point where I feel like I want to scream or rip my own skin off 

dreams literally fuck up my whole day.  if I have a fucked up dream I feel confused and shaken up for atleast hours afterward if not the entire day. depending on the dream i can’t tell later on if something really happened or not. If it someone did something bad to me in a dream i don’t want to be around them or talk to them for a while even though they didn’t really do anything. 

I change my mind a lot . I make a plan for myself and it sounds like such a great idea and then I change my mind so suddenly and decide to do something else or I just don’t have the motivation to do it anymore. i tell people all the time that I’m gonna do something and then back out and it upsets people. when i agree to do something i really want to do it, I don’t know why I don’t follow through. 

I like being around my friends and boyfriend but often out of no where i get so disconnected and anxious. I space out it’s like I can’t focus or listen to what anyone is saying and I really just want to go home. I get sudden relief when I am alone in my room. Like a weight being lifted.",31Oct2020,1
84,"You can't argue or reason with mental illness sometimes. Once mental illness has made up its mind what a mentally ill person believes is the truth no matter what happens. If you try to argue or reason with mental illness long enough you also begin to look mentally ill. If someone with a mental illness decides to abuse a child there is a period of time before the abuse to the child gets reasoned as just. When the child becomes an adult the abuse is justified by all of the mistakes the child made in its intentional misguidance.

85,"I had to leave my SO today after the second episode in months where they were a danger to themselves and not in their usual state of mind they are battling depression. I also struggle with an anxiety disorder so this has been very traumatic for me as well, but I do not blame them one bit. I was worried about their unpredictable behavior and had the gut feeling that I needed to leave before something else happened. I know they would never intentionally hurt me, but during the two episodes they were unpredictable and whether it be more broken glass or something like that, again just unpredictable behavior. I arranged for a family member to come stay with them and told SO about an hour before they arrived. This brought on agitation, some self harm (hitting themselves) and anger. They felt like it is the ultimate betrayal. The family member has assured me that I did the right thing. My SO is very upset with me and I am having trouble getting them to understand what it is like to fear their unpredictable behavior without them feeling like I am shaming or attacking them. I just want us both to be healthy. They were upset that I didnt talk to them first before the arrangements were made but I was worried about their reaction to me leaving. Please help me with phrasing that might help them during this vulnerable time for both of us.  If they end up hating me, at least I know they are safe and that I am safe. But if I can get through to them I would like for them to understand why I had to do this. Thank you so much, feeling very brokenhearted right now.",31Oct2020,1

I used to *hug* people? Greet them in the morning? Hang out in groups? That just sounds insane....nowadays I do my best to avoid everyone on my way in and out of work. Good mornings and good nights just seem so trivial... like, you don't know me. You're not my friend. Why should I talk to you?

But how does anyone become a friend if you don't let them in? I try to remind myself but it doesn't work.

Even people I care about. People I love. I'm always at an arms length. I imagine myself showing them what they mean to me but then I get scared. Being friendly feels so *foreign and wrong,* like I shouldn't be doing it.

I'm so tired of this trauma. I know my brain is protecting me. I know that's why I forget. I just want to be normal... or at least I want people to understand. I can't smile at you and ask you how you are and mean it. I don't care. And it's not my fault. I *want* to care.

You could say my mind goes blank in a way, as I’ve had an issue with that, and I have issues recalling a lot of events from my childhood due to some trauma I’m wasn’t even really “aware” of until recently. Still, tonight I really just wanted to let my emotions out. I felt frustrated, and I felt sad for reasons I can’t put together after hanging out with friends. It was an attitude change that the people around me noticed pretty easily on the way back home. Yet, for some reason, when I finally got into my car alone I cried... but it only lasted for a few seconds. So, again, I tried crying. Tears arose, but once again, they faded. It was as if I was in a constant battle trying to get my emotions out. Eventually, I’d just cry over not being able to cry, but fall empty once more. I wanted to let those feelings out so bad, yet it felt like my body was refusing me that right. To me it wasn’t even necessarily a bad feeling, if anything it felt good to feel myself cry for those every few seconds I could.

And people would never know because of how I look. Which makes it even worse I don’t get special treatment for looking nice I get treated as if my life is perfect therefore I should be given a tough time. Which pushes me to hate people even more.

I tried to cancel maybe 3 or 4 times within a span of 2 hours. Ultimately, I decided that it’s best to get out of the house and see my loved ones. 

They ended up driving together to the restaurant and were about 20 minutes late. I, of course, was early and stood outside by myself for about 30 minutes watching couples walk by happily, enjoying their date nights. I recall looking at people and wishing I felt even 1% of their normalcy. 

Those 30 minutes felt like hours. I almost got in my car and drove home because I wanted to break into tears when I realized I can’t even stand by myself in public anymore without feeling sad, anxious, alone etc. 

I can’t remember the last time I’ve ever felt so alone. Actually, maybe never. I used to love being alone. Now I’m scared of being alone with my thoughts. It’s terrifying. 

I cried three times during the dinner and stormed out once because I was so upset. I feel like such a burden. No one has ever really seen me like this. I’m usually the person everyone puts their weight on. I’m not used to this. This isn’t me. 

But the first step is realizing there’s something wrong. My friend told me that I’ve hit rock bottom and there’s only way to go and that’s up. I hope it’s true.  🤍",31Oct2020,1

96,"For a reason unknown to me, this urge is particularly strong when I'm on the internet. I'll give you an example. More than three years ago I've joined a fandom – and that already makes no sense because I don't consider myself a fan of anything – but I wanted to share the facts that I had found about the death of a public figure with the people who were discussing this case. The first response I got should have been enough for me to realize that they didn't understand what I wrote. But I couldn't let go of the thought that I would be able to *make* them understand. To make a long story short: I've wasted two years trying to do this just because my brain wasn't – and still is not – able to process that there are people who don't have the same understanding as I do.

I stopped sharing posts with this fandom but came back without anyone knowing that it's *me*. After I first left I've made a promise to myself that I won't share anything about this death case with those people ever again – and I've kept it. I guess that's what they call progress. But I'm still stuck where I don't belong and I'm waiting for something that I know will not come. At least not from *those* people. 

Every day makes me feel bored, dissatisfied and drained because I have so much to say and want to share it with an audience who wouldn't understand it. I just don't know why. There are people who don't know their purpose in life – and then there's me, exactly KNOWING my purpose without fulfilling it.

It seems like I'm playing a role I don't fit in. On the internet as well as offline. I quit so many things I used to enjoy, I force myself to drink certain alcoholic beverages that taste like sh\*t to me and I try to be part of communities that don't understand my worldview.

I desperately want to change but there's something holding me back – and at this point I just want to know what it is, how I can heal from it and if anyone feels the same as I do.

It hit me last night that I'm not really feeling anything when my guinea pig died. I definitely cared for him and loved him when I first got him but I felt absolutely nothing when I found out he'd died. I faked every single bit of emotion I could so my partner didn't think I was absolutely insane but I haven't cried a tear. I've seen him since he passed and nothing hit me at all. I don't even feel any form of grief at all and that's not normal for me.
I've realised that I think about myself in other sort of persons too if that makes sense? Like I'll literally think something like ""me, when the food is late"" instead of actually processing what's going on. It's really jarring now I've realised it but it sort of wont stop.
I laugh when I'm supposed to laugh, say 'aw' when I'm supposed to and everything like that. The only thing I get is irritated and even then I'm not really feeling it, just acting it.

So tonight, as I was driving home.. I had a moment where I was about to turn left onto a new road and cross the other lane of traffic. There was a car coming. For a split second, my brain said to me “Turn. See what happens”. 

My brain also immediately went “Oo that’s not good”. 

I used to get these kinds of thoughts all the time.. I would be driving down the road and think, “I wonder if I were to drive off the road at full speed into (insert stationary object here) what would happen” I never did it because I didn’t want to do that and survive. If I was going to drive into a building, I didn’t want to deal with any aftermath. 

I stopped having those thoughts 6 ish years ago when I graduated from college.. 

It terrified me to have one tonight. I sat in my care for 30 minutes once I parked in my spot and sobbed.

After just over a year of bouncing between health specialists for help and answers, I had finally been steered in the right direction over the past few months and have recently undertaken a WAIS-IV test. I've received my results and discussed them with the neuropsychologist who handled me through this process. The strengths and weaknesses brought to light through my report reflect exactly what I've been able to make sense of how my own brain works through self-reflection, so there are literally no surprises to me.

I'm only going to post my statistical results of the test and nothing else too extensive as I'm concerned that I might dox myself. Besides that, I'll briefly summarize the comments made by the neuropsychologist on the report if anyone needs it.

The neuropsychologist suggested to the Psychiatrist I'll be seeing that I undergo further examination for symptons of ADHD. They said that my test results showed \*considerable variability\* and that it is evident throughout. They told me that my processing speed is very odd compared to how I performed in other areas. On one test for processing speed I performed within the 99.2 percentile, while on another for processing speed I performed within the 88 percentile (not exactly sure on that, it was in the 80's). They said these were very similar tests and that the kind of variability I showed was not normal. This variability was evident in almost all my tests. I'm going to be taking another test soon that will indicate whether or not I fit the description for ADHD. I'm personally not sold on ADHD, I share a ton of the symptoms, but from what I've read online, many of the symptoms I recognize can also be attributed to a number of other mental illnesses.

I must also mention that I am depressed and have social anxiety issues that I'm currently working on. They acknowledged this but they are not sure as to what extent these were a factor, which is fair. But I must stress that my memory, ability to multi-task ,and various other executive functions, have always been sub-par compared to my peers (of course these are personal evaluations, I could be exaggerating).

This is all I'm going to say as of posting this. If anyone has any other questions that could be answered by the results on my evaluation, then please ask. I have the report with me. I won't be taking the ADHD test for a while, which means that, I won't be seeing the psychiatrist for a bit after that as they need 2 weeks to go over the results. I'm obsessing over this and I'm so so so excited to see where this goes. I just need some closure or something. I don't want a diagnosis. I just want opinions. Don't hold back. I'm an objective person, if someone says that my results are consistent with some disability that they've missed, then I would like to know. Also, I know that I shouldn't be looking for closure on an internet forum, let alone reddit of all places (lol), but I just need some theories or something, anything, to keep me from imploding on my own thoughts.

I get sad a lot and i used to just get sad and lonely and sometimes other stuff. But lately every time I get sad, I start thinking about telling somebody but then realize I can't talk about this with anyone. This always leads to a panic attack on top of it. I know I have my best friend and my boyfriend to talk to but I can't seem to actually do it. It just doesn't feel safe to talk to them (even though they are very supportive). A week ago I realized I don't really talk to anyone I just think about what they would say if I told them, but never actually tell them.

Sometimes when I do things that can easily be taken for granted, like making way for someone who wants to pass by in a store. Often people won’t thank you for that (at least where I live). I guess it’s debatable if you have to thank anyone for doing this, but when people thank me for that, I have to smile. I don’t mean like smiling as a reply. If they passed me, I will just stand there and be so happy.

Last night I decided to buy some wine and drank on my own and I was watching a movie on free to air and so there were ads and it appeared that the movie was switching to a Chinese movie and then switching back. I believed that the Chinese had hacked my tv. I even called the police emergency line a few times and ran down the hall of the apartment complex I’m staying in and banged on someone’s door. Police eventually came about 2am and they were looking at me like I was crazy and I said I had recorded the tv changing and showed them all the calls which they said was them calling me and they asked who my dr is. I remember saying to them “I knew you wouldn’t believe me”.

On top of the guilt of this, I have been distant from my friends and I just spend most of my day alone mostly because their busy doing life stuff and I'm just watching TV or drawing or playing video games waiting until they are available.

I got a job recently I start tomorrow in fact. I'm just super worried about me messing up, like I just keep imagining me messing up on such simple tasks in such an unrealistic way. I just have no confidence in myself, part of it stems from my self-loathing and my insecurities.

I have just felt so stuck in my head I have been having a hard time expressing any feelings to myself even when I'm completely alone. I just kind of lay sad. I felt so much worse two weeks ago in fact it's probably the most depressed I've felt in over a year to where I almost started crying waiting inside a grocery store for no reason just waiting calmly and out of nowhere tears started coming out my eyes and my face had that hot feeling but I had to hold it in with a calm and straight face in front of over seven people.

I generally have a hard time crying over anything the only times I do is during breakdowns, I'll go months of feeling sad or numb then one day just breakdown with uncontrollable tears out of nowhere I don't normally suppress crying in fact I try to get myself to cry more but it just doesn't happen even when I'm really sad.

I do put stock in religion now when before I didn’t as much, it was never something that came up in my household. I know that this will help me somewhat and it does but I am still scared. 

I’m scared of ms, esophageal cancer, and going to hell and that I will be feeling out of my own body and on a decline forever.",31Oct2020,1
114,"A little background, I suppose, in case someone relates to something:

My sister (24F) was in a car accident two years ago and suffers from a concussion, PTSD, heightened ADHD, anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder. Recent struggles have been psychotic breakdowns and hypo-religiosity. Doctors have suggested bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder, maybe triggered by her age and the accident. My family always thought her mood swings, self-centeredness, irrational thoughts were just a phase. She's never held great relationships with friends, seems to have a victim mentality (though she's been through a lot), and she can't stand being alone (though being around others overwhelms her). The problem is she believes she's completely fine, does not take any medicine, looks for signs from God, and blames everyone else with words like knives. She comes to her senses and apologizes sometimes.  ---  Helping her falls on me and my mom. I have an incredibly supportive family who would do anything for one another. There's ADHD and learning issues in family history, but not much else. My sister finds the men in our family uncomforting, so she turns to my mom and me. She resists all endless attempts to try to help her. Her boyfriend will undo any success we have in helping her, anyway. My parents want to believe it's just a rough patch and they can't stomach the idea of her having BD or BPD, so whatever's going on is untreated. My family and I have been stepping around her for two years, just trying to appease her and help so she doesn't hurt herself. With her mood, it's like walking on eggshells, and it's hard since we don't know exactly what's wrong. My parents overwhelm her easily, so she turns to me. 

I'm an out-of-state grad student. I prioritize my family over anything. My sister and I are close...until her mood suddenly changes or I stop appeasing her. She unexpectedly shows up at my college to stay with me (or her boyfriend's town to stay with him) whenever my parents overwhelm her. I drop everything for her when she shows up because my family and I worry what will happen if we don't. I'm the main person she vents to, gets advice from, and goes to for whatever she could possibly need or want. The year she was in the accident, I took on her college classes to keep her 4.0 and just get her to graduation while doing my own classes. I'd do anything for her, yet she doesn't see that. Whenever I'm away at college, she constantly begs me to come home; whenever I come home, she turns into a nightmare; whenever she visits me, nightmare. I find myself coming home at lot more because I feel bad for my family and want to help my mom keep an eye on her. I don't mind doing anything for her, I want to because at least I know I can help somehow. I'd do anything for her.  ---  But man, it's taking a toll on my mental health. I break down when things she wants are just too much for me. My mental health has plummeted, I'm way behind on the things I should be doing for myself, and even though I love what I'm doing, I have zero motivation for those things anyway when my family's in the picture. Nothing really helps her long term, and it certainly doesn't help me, so everything feels hopeless.  I don't know how to help her. I don't know how to help my parents themselves or help them help her. Frankly, I've been putting myself third. I'd love to just get a job and move away, but I couldn't do that to them. College is my little eScApE. My parents are fantastic and do everything they can. Honestly, we're a very fortunate family compared to many and I don't like to bother/inconvenience others. So I normally don't share things/problems with others unless I feel it's necessary. So reddit, here I am!   This is a vent/question, but advice/personal stories are very welcomed!  

How do you all help other people's mental health without sacrificing your own?",31Oct2020,1
115,"Idk where else to completely vent about this but.... my mother disd Easter Sunday and since then its been an avalanche of horrible death and money troubles. My mother died at 64 and I just turned 25 (after her death).    I need some random form of strangers saying get off your ass. I didnt expect to make it to 20 much less 25 and I have NO plan. I thought I would handle my mothers death better and my friends murder on top of it has me completely hopeless. I didnt want to make it here and people i expected to far outlive me are dying and I dont like it. How do I deal with this? Im bipolar and BPD as well which is making it harder.

116,"30, m, usa. I posted in kind voice yesterday but didn't get any responses. I'm a good person but I struggle with a lot of mental health problems. GAD, MDD and ADHD all formally diagnosed, pretty clearly suffering from PD and PTSD but should be screened soon. I have mood swings every 6-8 weeks, my doctor was trying to figure that out. I'm on a really low thing of zoloft

Anyway yesterday for work I got called down to the office to get told about a client complaint and I just completely broke, I had an insane anxiety meltdown and freaked out and quit my job on the spot. I was well over the edge before the conversation even started to be honest. Just could not handle the criticism anymore and my brain just short circuited and I got totally upset. Most people can take criticism at least a little better than that, and I do try, but here it's like I lost control. I couldn't stop melting down, I just felt so awful.

I have just been having an anxiety attack for most of the last eighteen hours. I did sleep for a while but the entire time I've been awake since yesterday I've had this chest tightness that won't go away, it's like I can't come down from this lurching, visceral anxiety attack. I do have a lot of anxiety usually, but now I feel like I'm stuck. I would love some type of tips for coming down from anxiety attacks... I'm doing controlled breathing and drinking water and stuff. My stomach hurts badly. I did contact my doctors office. I would honestly also just like anyone to talk to at this point, about anything, I would do anything to get rid of this feeling like my heart has exploded or is going to explode.

117,"One of my symptoms is dissociation. I don't disassociate very often anymore, but large swathes of my childhood are blank. Huge gaps between memories, half memories and things that I'm sure I misremembered. 

I only remember one birthday party from when I was a kid. It was (I believe) my 9th birthday, and it was at a hungry jacks. I got a t-shirt saying 'I'm a Hungry Jack's birthday kid' and I loved it. I remember getting a few stellar presents and gorging myself on icecream cake. From age 5 to about 25, I do not remember a single other birthday. 

I remember the 1992 Olympics, loved watching the gymnastics and diving. And I loved the song. Cant really remember any others. I was a gymnast for quite a few years, won medals and was overall pretty good. I remember very little of competing, or even practicing. 

I remember having my primary school teacher reading Roald Dahl to us in year 4, doing the voices and getting well into it. I think it must have been Mrs North who sparked my love of reading. 

I remember Christmas 2000, only because I got my first mobile phone. Other Christmases kind of blur into one, the ones before my 30s. 

I don't really remember much else. I have flashes and small memories, but not linear memories. Sometimes something will trigger a new memory, or a cascade of memories. It can suck sometimes, because not all memories are good. 

I could never write a memoir, I wouldn't have the first clue where to start. My dissociation started young - Around 4 to 5 years old I think. I was sexually abused at around that age by a family member and I only remember moments and flashes of what was done to me. 

I have always struggled with short and long term memory, to the detriment of some personal relationships. I use the calendar on my phone for everything. Even to remind me to water the plants. And to put the bins out.

128,"Hello everyone, i apologize in advance if this isn't the right place to talk about this. 

About a month ago my therapist gave me the contact info of one of her colleague who has many years of experience in testing adults for ADHD. My first problem was actually calling the place for more info on the process and to fix a possible date for the test. 

I procrastinated for more than a month but I was fortunate enough that he had an opening for me the very next week (so yesterday), which is better than my university's clinic's 6 months to 1 year waitlist. 

The psychologist himself was super nice and tried his best to make me feel comfortable but I can't help but feel like I've just wasted my one chance at maybe finding out what's wrong with me. The only thing I can remember from our phone interview is me rambling on about dumb shit. I could not have given more dumb answers. In my mind I could clearly see the point I was getting to, but I somehow always lost my thoughts mid sentence. 

Right after the interview ended, that's when my brain started remembering all of the relevant problems I could have talked about to actually HELP him make his assesment. It was even worse with the visual and math tests. I've never been more unable to concentrate than right then.

I feel defeated, like it's my fault I'm this incompetent. Reading back on my report cards when I was 4 and 5 years old (the psychologist recommended me to bring them with me for the tests if I still had them), I seemed to be such an active kid with almost no problems. I'm starting to think it really was my fault for watching too much tv or spending too much time on the computer, and that may have hindered my development.

131,"hi people of reddit. this is my first time posting because i’m having a really hard time right now. i also posted this under relationship advice. here’s the situation: 
i (f, 20) met this girl (f, 20) about 4 months ago, we went on a few dates and i asked her to be my girlfriend. she said yes and we started dating seriously. she went off to college 1,000 miles away but we were determined to do long distance until she comes home in december. it was going great, we found time to be with each other. she said she loved me and i love her so much. yesterday out of the blue she broke up with me. 
she has really bad episodes where she disassociates for weeks or months at a time. she doesn’t know what she’s doing or who she really is and she avoids talking to people. she doesn’t feel present during this time. she said she wanted to break up to avoid hurting me when she goes into another episode, because she feels one coming and doesn’t want to suddenly disappear for months. she also feels like there are multiple versions of herself in her mind and she doesn’t know which one is real. 
she can’t get therapy because she can’t tell her parents and she’s on their insurance. without the insurance she can’t afford it. i said i would help her in any way i could because i desperately want her to get better. i know it’s such a hard thing for her to deal with but she says being with me will only be bad for both of us. she thinks worrying about the fact that i’m worried about her will only make it impossible for her to get better. 
she said it might take years for her to get better. i said i would wait, because neither of us really wanted to break up. she is worried that she will never get better. i love her and she loves me. she doesn’t want me to miss out on opportunities or other people because she thinks someone else could make me happier. 
it might sound dramatic, but i don’t think i’ll ever get over her. it’s only been a few months but it feels like lifetimes with her. we have so many things planned to do together and i don’t want to do them with anyone else. 
we are trying to stay friends. because we both want each other in each other’s lives. i know it will get easier eventually but right now it feels impossible. 
i’m open to anything. tips on how to deal with a breakup, any suggestions on what she should do to get better, should i wait for her in the hopes of getting back together, or should i try to be friends and see what happens in the future ?",31Oct2020,1

I’m in no way saying that I have a mental health issue, that would be irresponsible of me to say, but I won’t completely rule that out either, even if it’s just minor.


Basically, I realised I’m a very angry person. Which I hate. I always try and pride myself on being the kind / caring person when it comes to friendships or other such things, sometimes that doesn’t work but I try.


Issue is, I’ve always got this feeling of anger, deep down inside. And I know that if I acted on it I would feel good, and honestly that scares me. Like this is a very strong sense of anger, towards anyone at all almost. 


I’m not sure how I got this, I’ve never gone through any traumatic events I don’t think. I bottle a lot so maybe that’s it? I’m really not sure.


But good news, I’m very good at controlling it, for now. I’ve been very good at controlling it for a while but recently I’ve seen that slack off a bit in recent times. I won’t go into details but when people are being real assholes it’s getting harder and harder to at least act on that anger in a small way, and sometimes I even do without even thinking.

So this girl was one of my best friends for many years. She was twice my age (some found that odd as they assumed I should be clubbing and she should be with her family) but we just clicked. We both volunteered at the same organisation, that’s how I met her. 
Anyway, I’ve always suffered with anxiety and depression then ptsd. Things became really tough, my grandfather was dying, I was having family problems, I couldn’t study, I couldn’t leave my bed some days, the organisation seemed to be targeting me because I was their youngest volunteer and I believe they felt threatened by me so they made my life difficult and I’m the kind of person who doesn’t want to have problems with anyone. 
Anyway, I was a mess and I would confide in my friend. What I didn’t know is that she couldn’t deal with my emotions and the amount I was texting at the time. So she snapped and said some awful things like I was too intense that She needed a break from me that I needed to find more friends etc. i gave her her break but it was a lot worse coming back. 
My grandfather died, I was alone, my parents had to go overseas for the funeral and she never came to see me to check if I was ok. She lives 5 mins away. She was more distant and I felt like my texting and my mental health was ruining our friendship (I later learnt I have childhood emotional neglect) I wanted her to meet with me so I could explain what was going on but I couldn’t and she never saw me either. She also decided to complain to my organisation about me and how we were going through some issues. Something that shouldn’t have involved them but in the end the organisation abused me like crazy and I’ve now lost 20kg in 10 months, half my hair, all my friends, I can’t leave the house and I don’t want to live anymore.  
The person who was my friend caused a lot of pain and suffering in me and I’ve reached out to her many times in letter form, as she has blocked me and everyone in my family, for a meeting as I need answers as I need closure because I’m terribly afraid that I might not see 2021 because of the pain I’m in but she has rejected me.

A book for someone who can’t understand mental illness or something about not leaving your struggling friends behind or what it’s like to live with mental illness. Something along those lines.

I'm very tired all the time, I'm tearful every few hours because the smallest thing upsets me, my hands are clammy, my heart is beating a lot, I feel hopeless and defeated. I don't have any energy to do anything, even going out the house to the postbox feels overwhelming.

Talking to people over the phone or face to face is really difficult and takes up a lot of energy, I had a phone call earlier about a job opportunity and I feel drained after talking with them.

150,"Hi all! My name’s Alice, and I have been having issues with mental health lately. I consider myself a gamer, and I know many other gamers may have depression, anxiety, bipolar, and basically any other mental illness under the sun. I am not saying that all gamers have issues with mental health... just that some do.

I want to start a community that is based online, with a website, a discord, and a twitch presence. The point would be to support anyone in a hard place, by holding events like game nights, art streams, and music streams. Additionally, I hope that members would make friends and would be able to offer solace in camaraderie. It would basically be an online support group.


I have a lot to figure out. But what does everyone think? Is this a good idea?


Best,

151,"I am messed up. My moral compass is all jumbled up. I feel no remorse when it comes to rape (not that I've done it ), usually one would feel thats messed up but I don't, idk why, I just don't, I see it as ""normal"".

Imagining doing it to a person step by step or having thoughts of just doing it with no hesitation  feels normal. I am not even disgusted by it. I know I am fucked up but I dont feel like I am. I don't want stop but I need to.

Back in the days, I would argue with myself in my head on why rape is wrong, no, I just know it's wrong by instinct.

Just thinking doing it to my classmate excites me. Yes I am still in school, a 14 yo who is just wrong in the head. 

I am afraid once I get a taste of it, I wont stop. Like I won't.

I even had the thought of raping my sister and my mother in front of my father. 

""God, this is wrong"" feels like a lie. I just don't feel like it is. 

Sorry for the long text, I just don't know why I am like this.

He’s really happy with her and she seems awesome from her fb profile. In our convos I get very invasive and ask really personal questions like the sex and intimate details. And just what they are like together, just A LOT. I know that’s unhealthy. But it’s feeding something in me to where I am comparing myself to her and his and i relationship, and confirming that she is indeed much better in every way, and I can see that because of how satisfied and genuinely happy he is with her than he ever was with me. He’s more emotionally connected and actually intimate with her instead of disconnected like he was with me. I think that’s why I’m asking so many questions. To see where I fell short. Like learning about how she’s great at sex and certain acts that I never did with him, or just how comfortable he is with her and how he’s met all her family and they love him. How do I stop asking these questions? He’s only answering because I’m asking, and only talking to me because I want to be friends. I’m in such a bad spot. I don’t want to delete him off fb. He’s hardly active but he will likely post a pic of them together or change his status at some point and I’m already broken from just knowing we will never be together again and knowing the things they are doing together.

161,"So I'm (30F) living with my parents and youngest brother (I have 1 older and 2 younger brothers) at home. Most days, we get along, but there are some days where I feel like my parents are looking for reasons to get mad at or pick on me. If my mom asks me anything about my boyfriend (who is living in Colorado at the moment and I live in Texas) then she'll find a way to revolve the conversation about my weight and tells me I need to lose weight. I will admit, I do need to lose some weight, but she tends to do this while I'm eating. I usually stop eating when she does this, BUT then she starts getting mad at me for not eating enough! If I'm using the washer and dryer then she'll suddenly need it and gets mad at me for ""hogging it up"" and that I should've done this when she doesn't need it.

As for my dad, he and I are usually cool, but we get mad at each other very easily. Usually it's over petty things like him telling me to get him a bottle of water when he's like 5 steps away from where we keep the water bottles and I'm on the other side of the house. Or him getting mad at me for taking about 30 minutes in the shower. Now, ever since my dad fixed a leak in the bathroom, it takes about 10 minutes for the water to get lukewarm. The water pressure is also pretty pathetic so it takes a long time for my hair to get wet. Plus, I'm the one paying the water bill, not him so it's not like he's losing any money. He doesn't like it when I play that card against him because he has to always be right. 

Now, he's accusing me of not flushing the toilet (which I always do because the one time I forgot, both parents lectured me for 15 minutes each on how to be ""ladylike"" back when I was 14) and when my mom confronted me about it, I told her that they ""need to look at their sons"" to find the culprit. Insert my mom lecturing me on owning up to my mistakes and that it's ""not cool"" that I throw my brothers under the bus and that I shouldn't name any names (notice I didn't name any names). So I tell her, ""Yeah, but it's not cool that I'm being accused of something I didn't do."" Insert another lecture here about how I need to shut my mouth, stop accusing my brothers of my wrongdoings, and stop talking back. Just to clarify, my older brother and younger brother don't live with us, but they've been visiting a lot this week.

It feels like I'm walking through a minefield most day with them. They celebrate the small and big victories for my brothers. Me, I get a pat on the back at most and usually I get a ""Oh, well you should've already accomplished that already."" I kinda feel like the black sheep of the family. I do want to move out, but at the moment I don't have enough money. Plus, my current job is not a guarantee for next year since I'm working as an office aide and online help for an elementary school. My contract is only good one school year so I don't want to be left stranded. I've considered moving to Colorado with my boyfriend and we're discussing our options.

The first response I got should have been enough for me to realize that they didn't understand what I wrote. But I couldn't let go of the thought that I would be able to *make* them understand. To make a long story short: I've wasted two years trying to do so just because my brain wasn't – and still is not – able to process that there are people who don't have the same understanding as I do.

I stopped sharing posts with this fandom but came back without anyone knowing that it's *me*. After I first left I've made a promise to myself that I won't share anything about this death case with those people ever again – and I've kept it.

Two hours later I finally finished. Looked on my phone (never really properly looked at my whole face during it) and well didn’t like it but thought “maybe it’s not so bad”. Edited a little and was worried to over do it so left it. Went to ask my boyfriend for his opinion, he says “ I’m not a fan of makeup but I guess it’s ok”. I ask if it looks alright he shrugs and says sure. Gives no real opinion and it hits me, I look like crap and no where cute/attractive. More like a child has had free roam of my face. I get upset and he says “ don’t be moody it’s ok. Sure it’s your first time but could be worse?” By then I was crying with how I felt and well gave up on the makeup. 

Fair he doesn’t like makeup in general but what really hit hard was the reality that I’m screwed. Not even makeup can fix/patch my ugly ass face. How stupid and childish I looked.

For context: we both met each other at a university. She graduated last spring, and I have a year left of school. We were doing long distance prior and we both knew it would be hard but we decided to do it. She was always so supportive of everything and put her 100% in it. And I tried my best to match her level of vigor. Before splitting to go through the long distance we were together everyday because of the quarantine and honestly it felt like this is how it would be if we lived together kinda thing. I loved it. I like to think she loved it. 

The breakup: She then tells me we have to break up. She has to think about herself and be selfish for it. She did it in a very clear and sensical manner and she made a lot of sense in relation to her problem with herself(which was discussed multiple times while we were together) I thought the problem at the time was detrimental and I wanted to be by her side. She refuses to acknowledge that it has to do anything with me but her and I refuse to accept that.

I feel like there so consensus for me. I feel like I have no say in this. Like I’m in a corner. I know The best thing I should do right now is giver her the space she deserves and respect her wishes but instinctively I don’t want to do that. I want to keep this relationship going I even told her I can wait but she said it’s unfair to her to make such consensus. I’m trying my hardest each day to not call her. I feel like I’ll go out of line. Maybe I should wait for another week and prepare some sort of message to clear my mind because I can’t particularly see through the clouds right now.

170,"Hello reddit, haven't been here long but I feel the need to post as I'm not sure what else I can do.

I (37m) have never been married, never had kids, very few serious relationships in my life (most of which were toxic, either she was or I was) and am starting to feel as if I missed out on a big part of life.  Having a wife, children, a family of my own.

I've always had a hard time making and being friends with anyone, much of it my own fault as I don't like to try to hangout or go do something as I always feel as if I'm a burden or bothering people. Whenever I try to keep in touch with anyone, I more often than not delete that message before sending (due to the whole I feel like I'm bothering people all the time).

Intimate relationships are difficult for me until I am very comfortable with that person, and even then its difficult for me to open up.  I have been down the rabbit hole of my past many times and know that I was abused as a child (by an older male) and that many of my issues stem from this.

Being an introvert, along with my past issues, being deeply insecure with myself, and self imposed solitude...I'm starting to feel my sanity slipping.  I have vivid thoughts of ending up old and alone, and while the thought of being alone doesn't instill any fear in me, I do feel a deep seeded need for companionship which I can't seem to find without second-guessing everything I say and do.

I have a few hobbies, dogs, a job...but it all feels grey to me for the most part with patches of color thrown in here and there.

After my most recent relationship ended, poorly, I took time off from dating seriously to work on my issues and try to become a better person overall.

Its been several years and I've not found a connection deep enough to invest in, so it was hookups, usually drunk...and the more hookups I went through with, the more I realized they weren't for me, shallow, unfulfilled, physical trysts nothing substantial along the lines of what I really want.

I can't be happy with someone else if I am unhappy with who I am right?  I have gotten better, somewhat, came out of my shell a bit, but still I feel worthless, unsuccessful, unattractive...the list goes on.

I think therapy is my only option but I do not have much money nor insurance. I'm not sure what else to do at this point.  Ending myself has crossed my mind and if it weren't for my dogs, I am not sure I'd be around to write this out.

Please help.",31Oct2020,1

I desperately want to change but there's something holding me back and at this point I just want to know what it is, how I can heal from it and if anyone feels the same as I do.

Thank you for reading this. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them. But you probably won't – why should you...",31Oct2020,1

As we know, we have a pandemic and sadly with this on top, my dad has terminal throat cancer. I have moderate depression and anxiety and my parents constantly forget I have this (or so it feels)

I live about 2 hours away, and across a border, just had a call of my mum to remind me it's my dad's birthday this weekend, I mentioned we have a pending full lock down and she tells me ""well we don't know how many more birthdays there will be"" also saying that we must be an exception, I reminded her there is no exceptions, even referring to something someone brought to the prime minister.

Life is shit right now, I miss my friends, I miss my office and I hate all this shit but then being reminded my dad is dying and I can't see him, it's just so much!

176,"For the past month I've had this weird sort of mental itch in the back of my mind to do something. 

I've always had a lot of hobbies. I make digital art, play multiple instruments, can code in multiple programming languages and a few more minor things. But recently I just can't get stimulated no matter what I do. I can't seem to start small basic projects that I know I can pull of easily but also can't continue big projects because they don't stimulate me fast enough. 

Now this problem started spreading into my academic life. Whenever I sit down to study I tend to start reading about more advanced topics on whatever subject I'm supposed to study. At the end of the day I might have a better understanding of that subject but overall it doesn't matter because I can't solve the problems in exam.

181,"Hi. This is my first time posting on reddit, and i'm not a native speaker, so i apologize in advance if this will be just a messy rant. I don't even know why i'm writing, but i don't know what else to do.
Background info: I'm a 19-year-old girl, and i've moved to another city away from my family to finally go to art school, something i've always, always liked and yet i had never found the courage to pursue until this year (last year, after finishing high school, i went to university to study languages and became even more depressed, but i don't want to write too much so i'll leave it there).

I thought that this would solve all my problems: i've always had my blue days, weeks, sometimes months, but i've always thought they were caused by external factors: a school i didn't like, my family, a city in which i felt i didn't fit in... During these ""depressive episodes"" most of the time i just didn't feel anything: i didn't want to leave my bed, i didn't want to drink (however, most of the times, i ate even more than usual) , i completely isolated myself from my friends, because i felt like i didn't want to explain myself to anyone. I just didn't want to exist. 
**********Trigger warning: self harm talk*************
When things got really bad, i also used to cut myself (not ""too badly"" though, because i was too afraid to hurt myself in a meaningful way, if that makes sense; and, as illogical as it sounds, that made me feel like i was such a failure that i couldn't even cut myself properly)
**********
I felt so guilty. Because i felt like it was my fault, that i was too lazy, i felt so anxious because there was so much i had to do, so much i potentially wanted to do, but something was holding me back, it was like chains hindered me and forced me on my bed. 
These feelings, these episodes, for some reason, are amplified during winter, but i have them throughout all the year: i simply feel like winter exacerbates them.

Back to present times: i finish high school, try out university, gather the courage to switch to art school (may 2020) and summer goes by more or less uneventfully (i wasn't productive at all, i still had low energy, but most of the time i felt ""neutral"").
I move to the new city (this was three weeks ago). I am anxious but also excited, and for two weeks i have so much energy, i draw everyday all day, it's all i can do. I've always switched back and forth from highs to lows, but never with drastic differences, meaning that my highs were more like either ""i don't feel like dying, i feel neutral"" or, sporadically ""i actually feel kinda nice and i want to do many things, and maybe i can do it"" (they didn't last long though). This time however i almost felt like a switch had activated, i finally had energy, i finally did my bed in the morning, i felt like i was in the right place. 
But last week i started feeling low again. I feel like the shadows are overcoming the light i fought so much for and that i finally felt like i had obtained. I don't want to drink, to get up, i just eat and eat again, hoping that this will solve something, and then i feel guilty because i ate so much and i despise myself and tell myself that tomorrow will be better but everyday is the same. I feel so lonely, and yet this loneliness is comforting. I want to talk to someone, but i fear that this is all in my head, i'm just lazy, i'm just too weak to function. 
I'm finally doing what i've always wanted to do and never had the chance, i'm in a beautiful city, i don't have financial problems: why am i not happy? Why am i never satisfied, why can't i be like the others? Am i just making this all up just to feel different, to feel special? I'm at loss. I'm sorry for the rant, i don't know what i'm trying to achieve. I just don't know what's real anymore, and i guess i'm seeking for some insight, for all it's worth. 
If you've come this far, i'm so grateful that you dedicated your time to me, and sorry if i've made you waste it.",31Oct2020,1
182,"A couple weeks ago, a reader reached out to me and asked for my thoughts about anxiety. It was something he and his significant other have been dealing with. I didn’t write about it right away because I wanted to really marinate on it. And after thinking about it a bit, I thought I’d start off with a brief breakdown of what it is and a recent personal experience.

# What is Anxiety?

Anxiety is an emotional, mental, and even physical response to worry and it can manifest in a lot of different ways.

Physically it can elevate your heart rate, make you sweaty, cause shortness of breath, or even lead to a panic attack. Mentally your thoughts can start racing, get fixated on a problem, or invade your thoughts. Emotionally it can take a toll causing you to feel drained and irritated.

Anxiety is something that everyone deals with, especially in light of COVID-19 and the upcoming presidential election and experiencing it temporarily isn’t a problem. That’s normal. It’s when anxiety sticks around that it can become a problem.

Last week I shared that there are [different levels of Emotional Debt](https://heem.substack.com/p/when-should-you-see-a-therapist) and this applies to anxiety too.

A mild form of anxiety comes and goes. It’s like the annoying fly that hovers around your food. You try to swat it away but it always comes back. You wish it wasn’t there and it can ruin the mood but it doesn’t really affect you too much. Eventually you move on or the fly just goes away.

A moderate form of anxiety sticks around. It’s like a marathon you’re forced to run. In the beginning, you’ve got energy to deal with it but the longer it goes on for the more exhausted you get. You want to stop running but you can’t. You hope that the marathon ends but you’re not sure it ever will.

A severe form of anxiety is like a prison. It locks you down. You can’t do anything but worry and catastrophize. You can’t sleep. You feel hopeless. The thing that worries you seems impossible to overcome.

If you are experiencing anxiety, I strongly recommend seeing a mental health professional even if it is at the mild level. You’d be surprised by how much it will help. But there are things you can do by yourself and tools you can develop to help manage it which we’ll dive into next week.

# My Experience With Anxiety

I’ve been unemployed for the past 5 months and it’s been really hard. Not only was “staying at home” a struggle for me because I’m an extrovert and I felt isolated, the endless cycle of applying/interviewing/rejection was really discouraging. It got to a point where I wasn’t sure if I was ever going to get a job in the field that I wanted.

I made a decision to take a major pivot in my life when I went from a pastor to working in the world of Bitcoin about a year and a half ago. Since then it’s been a wild ride. But in the midst of my unemployment, I started becoming anxious and questioned if I made the right choice.

You see this is what anxiety does. It wears you down. It challenges your perception of reality and once it breaks it, all bets are off. Once it reaches that threshold, the seal is broken.

My anxiety got really bad in my last interview a couple weeks ago. I sort of felt like it was my last opportunity because I had a lot of things going for me. I knew the team I was applying to. I felt like I met all the qualifications. I wasn’t sure where else I could apply to if it wasn’t for this position.

Thankfully, the interviews went fast. I met with three people on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Then it came time for the references. This is when my anxiety started to scream because now everything was out of my hands.

Now I trusted my references. I knew they would put in a good word for me. But I still couldn’t help but worry about what the conversations were like. I started role-playing the conversations in my head of worst-case scenarios. I started asking myself “what if” questions:

* What if they say something and the CEO takes it the wrong way?
* What if my references sabotage me?
* What if I don’t get the job? What am I going to do next?

My mind raced with lots of thoughts of fear and worry. I couldn’t sleep. I my heart would race randomly in the day. Even when I was playing games, my anxiety would invade my thoughts and distract me.

Finally on Monday I got the email with the subject line: “Casa Offer”. And when I read the first line of email, all my anxiety melted away:

&gt;“Hey Andrew. I've completed reference calls (which went very well), and I'm excited to officially extend you an offer to join [Casa](http://keys.casa/) as a Client Advisor!”

Getting that offer was like a huge weight off my shoulders. It was an answered prayer. I literally got on my knees and thanked God for a good 5 minutes. (P.S. this is also why I didn’t send out an email yesterday. Sorry! I might end up switching my weekly emails to Saturday).

What I realized at the end of that experience was that I was worrying for no reason. My anxiety did nothing for me. Of course hindsight is 20-20 but honestly, I feel like this is true for all the times I’ve been anxious before. No matter how much I worry about a situation, it doesn’t actually help unless I use that to do something productive.

For example if I’m worried about getting a job, I could use that anxiety to motivate myself to study graphic design or coding. But if all I’m doing is just sitting around and worrying, I’m just treading water until I drown or someone throws me a lifesaver.

Another take away I realized from that weekend was that it was an opportunity for me to use some of the tools that I had developed. I was encouraged to see that these tools worked and I’ll dive into some of them next week.

&amp;#x200B;

So I go to university and we had a positive case of Covid in my class. I was never close to him, but did spend time in the same room as him. Plus the possibility of other classmates being infected. I've been a bit hyperaware of my body since then (2-3 weeks ago) and in the beginning of this week I started having body aches like I was about to break a fever, but it never happened. Felt fine one or two days, then I spent the entire wednesday morning until lunch in a Zoom meeting, and when I was finished with that I had a bit of a weird heavy feeling in my head, so I figured I would check my temp just to make sure, and my temperature was 38,0 C. Checked it again a 1-2 hours later and it was suddenly back to normal. I still felt like there was something off though, like my body ached a little and my head still felt a bit heavy. Thinking back now, the ""fever"" might have been me using headphones for 3 hours straight, since it went back to normal pretty quickly. But I don't know, so I took a Covid test thursday afternoon but I wont get the results back until earliest monday. It will most likely come back negative since I feel pretty much fine now, though I do have a headache. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am quite familiar with this kind of headache though, it's one I get from spending too much time in front of the computer and it goes from my neck to my head. So I crave going on a walk and going outside to get rid of the headache, and I guess I complain about it a little too much to my parents. They're like ""Of course you can go take a walk outside, you don't have to be around people, keep the distance"". This doesn't feel right to me though, we live in an apartment building with 3 other families of which 2 consist of people over 70, so I'm like ""But what if I am positive, and touch things in the stairwell and other people contracts it? Or if someone happens to catch it outside, although unlikely? If I go outside and I then show positive I will feel guilty as hell"". And they don't really agree with me. My dad got a call from my grandma and he kind of complained about me ""yeah, she took a test and still hasn't gotten a result. She wont even go outside"" and my mother had a call with my aunt where she pretty much said the same thing, she did not say I was silly but in the way she spoke it sounded to me like she thought I was silly for wanting to stay inside. Both my parents are pretty certain I will show negative because of my vague symptoms. I feel like they think I'm silly for not wanting to go outside for a walk. And it seems both my aunt and my grandma agreed with them, so I don't really know anymore. Am I being silly?",31Oct2020,1

193,"[this post got a lot longer than I thought it was going to be but I thought that if I'm going to share my thoughts, I might as well do it properly ^^;] 


I've been struggling with my mental health for years but recently it has become a lot worse. My home situation isn't exactly the best and I'm struggling to keep up with school. Therapy isn't a succes either, due to cutbacks at mental health organisations it's much harder to find fitting treatment. I also experience this weird thing where I just can't express to my psychologist how I feel? Whenever I talk about my feelings I feel this immense urge to cry and I have the tendency to surpress my emotions so to prevent myself from crying I end up saying nothing.

So nothing in my life is going well right now and I am currently the most suicidal I've ever been.
But recently, whenever I feel utterly miserable or see no hope in the future I kind of ''doze off''.  I just start having this daydream about a better ''alterative universe'' if that's what I should call it? I think it's a new way I've found to cope with things. 

The daydreams differ but always have the same reoccurring theme. In all of my daydreams I run away from home and become homeless, in all of my dreams I meet a kind and understanding person who helps me achieve my goals and those goals are usually living on my own and having a successful career and lots of hobbies. 
I know this probably sounds silly but I don't know how else I'm supposed to explain it. 

Sometimes my daydreams feel so real that every time I ''wake up'' and get pulled back into the real world I get withdrawal symptoms and here is the part where I'm getting kinda scared. I can't help but think that perhaps the right choice to make right now is to take a big risk and run away. (chase my dreams if you will ^^;) 
I know deep down that it isn't a very wise decision to run away and that becoming homeless is the last thing I'd want to be right now, but recently things have rapidly been getting worse and I'm desperate for some improvement. I don't feel safe at home, school is making me suicidal and getting treatment is just one big administrative battle. 

Because everything in life is going so terrible right now, I can't help but think that I'm never going to be okay if I stay where I am. I've been in this situation for years and time and time again I've been let down by people who promised me they had my best interest in mind. 

I really don't know what to do. At one hand I shouldn't make rash decisions but at the other hand I really feel as if I'm drowning in my own hopelessness.

201,"Hey Reddit,

My name is Max, I am 16 years old. I haven’t been happy since I finished elementary school. I am currently in my 6th year of high school, which in my country should only take 5/6 years. I have dropped from the highest level to the average level and was set back a year. My parents divorced 3 years back.

I haven’t been happy because I don’t know what will. I have noticed that many of my ‘friends’ are closer to acquaintances than true friends. My only true friend lives in the US, 8000 miles away. I feel like I only have my parents who really love me for who I am, and that I seem to change myself for the people around me. I realized a while back that despite being fairly well off, material objects bring me no happiness at all, neither does exercise or bettering myself. The only moments I am really happy is when I am doing something I’m passionate about. I used to be passionate about lots of things, because I believed I could make a difference if I pursued those things, now I only really care about the football team I support. I have not been diagnosed as depressed and I refuse to self-diagnose as I feel that would only make my situation more difficult. I am also not suicidal, even though I don’t see a point in life and don’t see myself functioning well in a capitalist, result-based, judgmental society. I don’t know what to do with my life. Everyday feels exactly the same in the end. I am not afraid of death, as I don’t think anything I will do in my lifetime will have an impact on anything in the future.

I hope someone will see this and will be able to give me tips on how to be happy, or anything else that could help. 
I hope all of you have a nice day.

204,You guess right.  I'm talking about election anxiety.  We all know what's going to happen.  Biden wins.  Trump takes it to the Supreme Court.  Supreme Court hands Trump the presidency.  This is my coping mechanism right now.  All the hopes and unknowns are just killing me.,31Oct2020,1
205,"I was watching Gordon Ramsey with my boyfriend and I was on the phone while it was playing, so I’m watching the show and on the phone at the same time. I can swear to you, I heard my boyfriend say “look at her boobs” or “big boobs” or something that ended in BOOBS. I just looked up my phone and said to him that i didn’t notice it. Then as a joke I pointed at someone’s bulge and he got angry. 

So guys, he did not talk. He did not say that. I trust him because first of all it’s extremely out of character for him to even say that. 

But now, I’m thinking, let’s say gaslighting aside(I know those comments are gonna be here), if I heard that and it wasn’t him, does that mean I’m suffering from psychosis? Another theory I have is that he maybe thought of it, said it out loud, and didn’t notice it saying it. But that’s all I got.",31Oct2020,1
206,"So I'm trying to finally seek help for my many mental illnesses (OCD, social anxiety, misophonia, depression) but the problem is I have absolutely no money and no way to get started. 


To give an example of how bad my anxiety is...


I'm grinding my teeth, bending my toes into the soles of my feet, clenching my fists so tight they turn white because I feel so anxious and racy. I even have developed a nervous throat clearing/throat popping tic I do when it gets busy. I come home and sometimes I have chest pain, headaches, relentless fatigue, diarrhea sometimes lasting into the next day. All because I am in fight-or-flight all day long. Sometimes I come home and cry. 


I don't have health insurance (can't afford it). I only bring home $270 a week and all of that goes to bills and Uber rides  to work. I can't even afford to buy my own groceries. I was denied for Medicaid because I do not have children or am pregnant. I live by myself and don't have anyone helping me pay bills, I do it all myself. It's becoming increasingly hard with my anxiety. 


I appied for JPS Connection but after I got approved I found out their clinic is in a different city and I don't have transportation to get there. I can't drive and it would cost about the same amount as a co-pay to Uber there, which kind of defeats the purpose. 


Basically what I am wanting to do is see a psychologist who can prescribe me medication and follow-up with me every few months.  


There is a MHMR in my city but I feel bad going to them because I know they cater to mentally challenged and severely disabled people, like people who REALLY need free resources and help--and I don't feel like I fit in those categories. 


I don't know what to do. I feel like every time I try to do something productive something always, always stands in my way.",31Oct2020,1
207,"hey guys, so i just realised that my co-dependency is getting worse. i didn’t know it till yesterday and i guess it’s bothering me ever since. me being me, i over-analyse every text message i have with my boyfriend, noticing the change in tones and enthusiasm and stuff like that. so i guess i was triggered yesterday and i really had a rough day today because i was over-thinking and coming up with scenarios in my head on what’s going on.

on the other side, my rational brain is asking me to chill the fuck down cause i know he’s just having a rough day with not being able to celebrate halloween due to the coronavirus. but obviously, the irrational side of me took control and i’m trying SO hard to resist the temptation to text him if there’s anything wrong between us. i probably have pmdd too and my periods coming so maybe that’s why my brain is all acting up but i need this trait of mine to stop. i’m sabotaging the relationship and i can’t afford to do that. i’m honestly so lost and it sucks feeling like this. my brains all clouded and stuff ya know? 

idk why i posted this post but i guess it’ll be great to hear some opinions on what i should do. should i tell him about what i’m feeling or not?",31Oct2020,1
208,"My family says I’m lazy and entitled. I have quit many jobs and chances to go to school since I graduated high school in 2016. I’ve been trying to figure out what I want to do and become a better person but I’ve just felt weird and trapped since I graduated 


I did a lot of drugs in highschool but even before that I was always acting up, and a bit wild. Something on me now just feels like numb. I have little drive to do things , I’m a bit akward , I have a hard time communicating and focusing, and overall I’m just confused.

I like exercising, eating and cooking clean food, computers, bass music, YouTube videos, movies, tea, salad, snowboarding, ect. 

I don’t have a good relationship with my family. My grandmothers old and harder to communicate with but I love her dearly, I just find it hard and I motivating to have a relationship with her. My mother just works all the time and is a bit crazy having delt with me my brother and my father as we were growing up. She was put under a tremendous amount of stress and now resents me for moving over to my grandparents in high school. We can’t really communicate, and she says she refuses to have a relationship with me until I get a job and support myself. She hasn’t been there as a mother since I was young, but she always supported me and tried to keep me going down the right path.

I live on my own. I live with three guys I dislike , they are loud and unclean. They slam doors at night and it bothers me so much. I was working at Pizza Hut. I’ve been tryna go back to school but I’m not in a position to take on the loan my parents say I need to get . They said if I pass my classes they will pay it off. Ok . I don’t know what I want to do and I had a job as an industrial electrician but quit it after a day. 


I’m constantly back and forth on things. Can never make up my mind. Worry about things, yet I feel like my brain doesn’t work right. My moods sometimes up sometimes down and I just feel a bit unstable and weird. 

I’ve got an appointment to see a counselor in November , and then a path in January. I’ve been scared for so long to see a doctor and get on medication but I just want to get to a point I’m happy again. 

Sometimes I feel fine and am totally happy with myself others I just feel dead inside and like an old man. 

Overall I’m a pretty positive and easy going person though. I take care of myself and am thankful for what I have.


My mom and brother have always said I have no problems it’s all in my head. That’s maybe what stopped me from getting help for so long. I tried to just deal with it. I tried eating clean, fasting , exercising, ect. It was so hard for me to come to the realization I might need to seek mental help.

Everyone calls me lazy and entitled. I know I need to get a job and work for what I got. Part of me just doesn’t want to. Everytime I get into something I psych me self out and quit it. I just want to find something I enjoy. 

I have no problem with hard work I’m just confused and don’t know what way to turn. 

How can I help myself/ change these negative thought patterns. Does it sound like I need mental help? How should I deal with my family issues? 

Am I just lazy and entitled? How do I go about changing that about myself?

Thanks in advance",31Oct2020,1
209,"I feel extremely guilty right now. I grew up in a household where grades and academics were above everything. I’m a teenager in high school right now. I failed to get accepted into a more prestigious high school with special programs and such (right now I attend a regular public school). My parents were obviously disappointed. Fast forward a couple years and I’m struggling so much in class. I was once an avid reader in middle School and now I just want to sleep. Or rather, I want to freeze time, give me more space to complete all my incomplete work, etc. I have terrible time management, and I haven’t practiced my piano and theory in so long, with a theory exam coming up in a few months. I don’t know if I have depression or not. In my home, mental health is something that has never come up, and I doubt it ever will. I’ve never done any self-harm, but I’ve thought about killing myself so many times. I usually think to do it after a fight with my parents/sibling. I want to hurt them as much as I can. But then, after a few hours, I feel extremely ashamed of myself. After all, my brother is in elementary school, and I don’t want to hurt him. The thing is, after a fight my mom usually says “you always take everything for granted!” In fact, I think that’s her favorite phrase. She’s been throwing it around ever since I could remember. I want to kill myself in order to hurt her, to make her rethink how she treats me. I’ve also thought multiple times about breaking a limb or jumping down the ravine in the trail near my house. I’ve never had therapy, nor have I ever talked to anyone else about this. I don’t know if this is important or not, but I feel happiest during the winter when I go snowboarding and skiing with my old family friends (my mom doesn’t go with us, she stays home). That’s it, I think. Just a huge vent. I would like some advice about diagnosing mental heath illnesses, as well as therapy. Thanks for reading. Don’t be afraid to tell me if I’m insane.",31Oct2020,1

She married a neo nazi for love when he own children weren’t enough and when we began to grow into our own she used her husband as a whip to keep us down. I am now an adult on my own and I harbor many regrets, mainly because I waisted my own youth and I waisted my love and respect on someone who didn’t deserve it. Their was physical mental and emotional abuse. all that I crave now is sweet vengeance, I will offer no love no sympathy nor understanding I will cut down my mother like the rote she is I want her to suffer as I did. I want to have her locked up in a mental asylum for life the worst one I can find in the whole nation, and have her force feed medication that will actually make her illnesses worse then before strapped down electroshocked regularly and lobotomized. I care nothing for how she feels what she needs and I don’t want to see her getting better and I especially don’t want her out in the world living life.

I’m going to hire a lawyer and go to the courts to get custody of her when she has her next break down then I don’t care if it takes every cent I have I will see her in a restrained Jacket for the rest of her sad miserable life. Then I will know true happiness as I look into her dead marble like eyes as drool drips from her lower lip, scares circulating her cranial like a Crown.

214,"Dear interested participant,

We are the Psychotherapy, Affirmation, and Disclosure Lab at Teachers College, Columbia University. We are conducting a research study on the experience of teletherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are looking at how clients experience psychotherapy since the onset of this pandemic and the widespread replacement of in-person therapy with teletherapy.

If you are currently in any form of teletherapy, either you started off having teletherapy or switched to teletherapy from in-person therapy since the COVID-19 pandemic, we call for your participation.

The survey takes between 10 and 20 minutes. It's easy to complete and (we like to think) thought-provoking and interesting. Your input will help improve the training of future psychotherapists. You’ll also have the option to join a lottery as our way of saying thanks. For every 50 participants, one participant will win a $50 Amazon gift card.

Simply click on the link below, or cut and paste the entire URL into your browser, to access the survey: [https://tccolumbia.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_9REGAWR4pNAXGrX](https://tccolumbia.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9REGAWR4pNAXGrX)

Please be sure to take the survey on a laptop, computer, iPad, or tablet -- you will not be able to properly complete the survey from a cell-phone.

We'd greatly appreciate it if you could take this survey as soon as you can. Your input is very important to us and will be kept strictly confidential. It will be used only for the purposes of research for this project and all responses are entirely anonymous.",31Oct2020,1

216,"It seems like many people feel aided and understood when they receive an autism diagnosis. It’s like a relief to finally get one, and a huge part of their identity.

I received an autism diagnosis many years ago, and sometimes it has felt like a bother, other times like it’s just there and I feel detached. It hasn’t been useful, doesn’t define me and has not felt like the ease of a burden.

Anyone else with a similar experience? Who doubts their diagnosis, or hasn’t found it helpful?

Therapists I’ve met blame every struggle on autism(and sometimes refuse to see sides of me that are unusual for autism, or contrasts with those traits). Sometimes people expects you to be some kind of savant, which it’s stressful in its own way.

I feel even more of an outsider in autism communities than in neurotypical ones, and the experience has left me very lonely.",31Oct2020,1

220,"Hello Everyone, I recently learned about Social Rhythm Therapy and I was reflecting on how I can organize my life to give myself in that spirit to hopefully help my mental health. I figured it may be of interest to others!

221,"I have hesitated writing this for so long, it sits heavy on my heart and mind. I’m exhausted, overwhelmed and the weight is too much to bear. Now that I’m attempting to write it all down I’m struggling on where to begin.    
    
Basics:    
- I am attending individual and group DBT weekly.   
- I am on many medications.   
- I have been diagnosed with ADHD, GAD, MDD, quiet BPD, and C-PTSD.   
- 40F, married 12 years.   
- Working medically reduced hours at work
- Attending college part-time that work is paying 100% towards.
    
    
Intrusive thoughts:    
- hubby is frustrated and depressed that I don’t ‘initiate’ at all and am ‘never’ in the ‘mood’.   
- If I ask him no or move his hand away then he withdraws any affection and rolls away.   
- I believe I can’t keep up with household chores and up-keep alone but don’t know how to approach the subject since he drives an hour to and from work each day.   
- I wake up at 6am to take my meds, layback down till they kick in, usually about 7:30am. I get up, let the dog out, feed and water her, feed the cats, clean the litter boxes, make myself eggs, wash the pan and flipper before eating.    
- I then take breakfast to my desk and prep for the day. Write down a list of personal and professional things I have to address that day. Make sure my water tumblers are filled and my desk is clean and ready for the day. I am allowed to clock in 15 minutes early in order to go through emails, note current outages and outages that happened after I clocked out. Update my ticket queue. 9am auto in to start taking internal tech support calls.    
- Work day ends at 3pm. I’m mentally drained, physically exhausted and craving a nap. Sometimes I give in and can sleep from 4pm till the next morning, still not refreshed. Sometimes I push through it and attempt to get something off of my home to-do list done.    
    
I’m struggling. I want my energy back. I want my mental acuity back. I want my confidence back. I try not to judge myself harshly knowing from DBT that I am honestly doing my best. I take quiet reflective moments when I can, like when I let the dog outside, I stand out there with her (so she doesn’t take off) and close my eyes. I observe the temperature, any wind, any birds singing. I open my eyes and observe the trees changing colors, the clouds in the sky and the plants growing near the house.    
    
I’m rambling. I’m tired. I want to be a good partner. I don’t know what to expect from this post. I do know though I needed to get it off of my chest and get it to stop circling in my mind. Thank you for reading.

224,"I have a concussion.  
Having a lot of trouble processing this.  
Here's what happened to begin with.  
I was walking my girlfriend home at night.  
As i head back upstairs in the lobby i see a resident crying and pleading the guard to ''do something for the love of God please'' and ''there's a baby upstairs''.

It is obvious there is a domestic abuse situation, and the security guard is not doing much to provide help with the situation.  
I am at the stairs and i tell the man he should check it out. He says he can't do anything.  
I tell him i refuse to believe he can't do anything. He tells me he isn't the police. So i tell him he **is** a security guard, so he should provide some security. He walks away to the doorway, annoyed. And i realize he has even less oversight outside the building. The whole situation feels off to me. I am about to call the police, but realize i have no phone in my pocket.

So i walk outdoors to ask if i can use the guards phone to call police. He walks indoors, yells ''Sodemieter op!!!'' (fuck off!!!) and punches me twice with significant and violent force, in the fucking head. So i grab him and pull him towards the floor, restraining his hands and scream ''CITIZENS ARREST'' in his face about 5 to 10 times. I go outside to ring my girlfriends door so she can call the police, and he has fled into the office and i follow him, hearing ''you guys need to come quick''

So i shout through the phone ''yeah! you guys DO need to come quick'' at which point he starts yelling ''GO AWAY'' and is now using his flashlight (security / military grade, solid steel thing he's so proud of wtf) to baton me....

When the police arrived they almost tried to arrest me, and when i explained the story they said i could file a report the next day (?). I don't get the Dutch system really... The man was allowed to continue his shift until 7:30 am.... i was instructed by another caretaker to ''stay in my own room'' until he finished his shift for ''my own safety''..... Literally held hostage in a building with a ''guard'' who beats down on a client for absolutely no reason and that same guard who i should ''fear for my life'' has a security card that can open every frigging door in the building.

I am diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. I don't think they understand what that even means. This whole encounter is symbolic and indicative of the allaround level or ''quality'' of ''health''care we are recieving here. I'd hate to say it but there are worse problems here than being beaten up by the guy who is supposed to be providing your security.

Turns out that during that whole fight we were having downstairs, the guy upstairs doing the domestic abuse actually harmed a child in the process. Gross negligence isn't enough words to describe this. If the guard had only listened to what i said, we would have been able to stop this guy from harming that child. It was pretty serious i heard too.... I blame myself for this...

I feel so fucking alone in this i don't know what to do. They all lie to me here and the whole enterprise is sending caretaker after caretaker in an attempt to cover their asses. I want to sue this company because they ignore the complaints about this sort of stuff on a consistent basis. The writing is on the wall and people are getting hurt by their ignorance. A girl was hit so hard in this building that the whole building shook. My friend who lives 2 stories up, his glass shook violently when she was hit by the scum. People on the ground level at the furthest end of the building heard the sound of the violence from there. And i had sent 3 to 4 emails to the head master before this happened, warning that the situation was getting out of hand and action had to be taken.

And now they are saying they can't give me the cctv footage due to privacy laws. They are lying to my face because i have worked with these exact laws as a carreer photographer. These laws state practically the opposite of what they are saying. The footage should belong to the media / newspapers. But they want to get rid of the footage as soon as possible because everything they do here is just lies and deceit. They even got me to sign a LIFELONG contract without even telling me it was life long or what it even was. They just said i HAD to sign it, and that it would mean i wouldn't have to fill in forms every year so it was super convenient....

I'm writing to reddit in the hope that some outsiders looking into this can agree with the level of fucked up this is. I feel like my immediate surroundings people try to downplay this stuff. I figure it's something to do with the Dutch policies and rumours surrounding healthcare (it's notorious for being bad). But is ''acceptance'' really the answer? I'm hoping to hear from people who won't accept this as normal.

I'm considering moving back to the UK on short notice. I.E: the first bus i can take. This whole experience has ruined healthcare services for me completely, because there is no way i can establish a relationship of trust with such an organisation again.

I'd like to hear your thoughts and opinions on this.

Earlier this summer I was admitted to hospital following an attempted suicide. I was there for four weeks in a mental health ward. My two takeaways from this experience are: being in a mental ward is boring, not to say nothing happens but 95% of the time you are killing time between meals I your room or in a lounge on a sofa. And two my nurse and I became close. I’m not saying this because she checked up on my and asked me how I’m doing - that’s her job in the same sense service people are friendly towards you, don’t always think “ooh she likes me. I’m in”
No. She spent her breaks with me.we found we had common interests and similar family situation, her father is dead too. 
Physically-  we sparred once or twice (I’m into boxing and she’s kickboxing) nothing heavy ofc just a play about, and she complimented my body
Perhaps most telling is she suggested getting a drink once I had left. Actually my favourite memory of her was her gifting me a book and in the back writing a message :
        
     “To gemingo
                    
                x

            It will all be okay in the end, If it’s not           okay; it’s not the end

         Lots of love, 
                      (Name)
                                 x“

Later on we decided that would it be too unusual if she wrote contact detail in the book? You know if anyone found it and wanted to return it? ;) 

... after I left we got talking. Only slow at first but both of us showing interest in seeing each other “for a drink and maybe a game of chess?” (We played a lot of chess) 
Fast forward some two months and we’re still talking and we both want to see each other.. but now I’m blocked and she’s not replying to our (positive) chat in other social media. What happened? Seeing her again had kept me going since leaving hospital how do I move on? 

And, truthfully, I’ve come off my meds and I’m thinking again about getting rid of myself

These days I actually just feel like the walls are closing in every passing day. I try to be positive and do things that i used to love, but I find no joy in them anymore. Half a year ago I was rejected by a girl, and I got over it, but it feels bitter every day. I want to play ice hockey but I cant afford it, and I know it would give me some meaning atleast. The girls like me pretty much but it’s really nothing serious, so I don’t have any deeper connections like that. I wake up in the morning and just think ”is life worth living” or should I just die?

The girls like me, but I don’t care at all because I know I wont be happy because other people like me. I have no REAL friends, It only takes one real friend to make it, but I can’t seem to find it.

237,"Turned 21 today. 
I just want to say I probably don't have a single good friend. Im really not great at maintaining relationships. I'm socially awkward and trying to get better at it but it's so damn hard. Being a student my main focus is academia at the moment and I'm okay with this. 
To be super honest I've never been this super social type of person who posts a lot on social media or goes on trips or does other cool stuff. The pandemic has shown a lot of people's true colors and it sucks. 
Whenever I see people posting stuff on social media I always wish I could have something like the lives they have(dumb I know). I try my best to be genuine with people but still have a hard time. I just wish I had a group of trustworthy people instead of the shithole toxic environment im stuck in. People I could genuinely trust and who actually care about me.
I just want to know if it gets better going forward Im just really overwhelmed with life and it's getting harder day by day. Is this normal. I realise this is a vent but
 Rn all I feel is alone. II don't mean to come off as whiny really sorry if it looks like that. I would appreciate some input and didn't know what else to do. I feel like I'm losing everyone around me and I feel like shit right now",31Oct2020,1
238,"I'm sick and tired of living like that. Thousands upon thousands spent on therapy didn't help me. It only temporarily soothed my suffering. But the pain is permanent. Nothing seems to ward off the ongoing crises. They melt into one shapeless mass of anxiety, anger, disappointment, boredom, despair, emptiness, loneliness that fills every crevice of my life. I'm burnt out, sick of trying and never being enough. The outer shell, that once protected me, turned into a slimy monster taking over who I really am. I became extremely toxic, cynical, pessimistic, psychopathic, aggressive. I only haven't pushed literally everyone away because I'm scared of opening up. So I suffer silently. I lost hope. Nothing can save me anymore. I believe it would be ethical and rational if I gave up on life since I'm poisoning everyone. I can't live and I can't die, so I just spend my days slacking off, numbing my pain with a myriad of addictions and addictive medicines.

Sometimes I have the urge to restart my life but I don't have the resources. I have only secondary education which means nothing here. I'm dependent on my family and they sure can't handle more years of freeloading while I'm trying to get a degree. But even then, I wouldn't escape from myself and that's the core. 

No conventional therapy helps me and I'm pretty sceptical when it comes to alternatives. I'm so lost. I no longer want to live like this.",31Oct2020,1

240,"Warning: long and depressing.
TL;DR: I almost launched my car into a line of other cars or a road barricade because I was distracted.

I’m not going to go too into detail to preserve my anonymity, but I have nobody to talk too about this stuff and doing it completely alone and silent isn’t working. It never did, but now I can barely contain my emotions. I’ve been shaking uncontrollably and drifting in and out of panic attacks all day. It has become too severe now to house anymore.

Here’s the story:

I don’t make enough money at my job to handle all the bills and other financial burdens, so I have to do food deliveries out of necessity whenever I can fit them in, which just makes me resentful towards my job and myself for my decisions that led to this situation. So obviously I was driving while distracted. Well, after a couple hours of doing as many deliveries as possible, I had to hand off an order at a housing complex with tight security. As I was pulling up, I didn’t see a tall speed hump until the last second. I applied the brakes, but my car still went airborne. It landed fine and there’s no damage, but if I didn’t see it when I did, I could have really messed up and landed on a barricade or the cars ahead of me. Anyway, the security guard at the gate saw and asked if I was ok. I swiftly said I’m fine and went on to deliver the order.

After I was done, I exited the complex and as soon as I was out of sight from the gate, I started crying, obsessing about how embarrassing that was, how mad that made me at myself for not paying enough attention, and over the stress of finances and all my other baggage all at once. The panic took over again and I NEEDED to get home and not drive anymore, so I cancelled all my future orders. I need money, but I can’t put anyone in danger. That’s selfish.

So now, after jogging a few miles (what I do to use up emotional and physical energy), I’m laying in my room, alone again, smoking weed and writing this. I don’t know how to counter these emotions yet and they just keep pouring over onto the surface. The weed helps distract and writing this is helping me make sense of it all.

I’m not really looking for advice, well maybe I am, but I’m definitely not looking for a diagnosis. Just a place to put these thoughts. I had my first ever serious suicidal thought 3 days ago, so clearly I need help, but I don’t know where to go that won’t lead to an uncomfortable situation, more financial ruin, or dependence on further medication beyond weed.

All this said, I’m not on a ledge and I refuse to quit. I’m not a murderer. This will pass and I know I’ll be ok, but unfortunately the present is where the pain is. I am trying to forgive myself for the things I’ve done or haven’t done to put me here. I also recognize all the good things in my life, so I’ll be alright. I just want my body to stop trembling and my brain to stop obsessing so I can freely live outside the prison of my own thoughts.

As for the finances, only time will tell. I may have a chance at a promotion, though. Also, sometimes I enjoy doing deliveries, listening to music and driving around, discovering the city. I know it could be a lot worse, so I’m doing my best to not complain. This has just been my experience.

If you read this, thank you so much. Truly. Sometimes all someone in crisis needs is the feeling that they are heard, even if not fully understood.",31Oct2020,1
241,"So I've battled with myself for many years.
And a few years ago, I tried to start to get help... I failed. I let myself down.

This year it came to a head, after so long fucking up my happiness and the people that love me. I turned to get help.
I've started therapy. Which has been the biggest release I've ever had. Being able to talk to some one who won't judge me. And after 6 sessions we've got to a point where we are confident we have identified why I do certain things. Why I self destruct and why I can't just do things the right way.
So now it's understanding these behaviours and how to avoid them. Recognising what triggers my downward spiral and how to combat that.
It hard work. I'll tell you that much for free.

Now why did I start therapy... I wrecked my relationship. I won't go into the details. But over 5 years I just couldn't do the right thing. 
But... I didn't do it to save my relationship, I just finally saw the pain I was causing someone I love. I was inspired to seek the help I needed to get.

I've also finally got myself on anti depression tablets. I feel I've been fighting a losing battle for long time. Suicidal thoughts have crept back in over the last 8 or 9 months. I have no inclination to act on them, but they are very tiring to ignore. I have to actively think about other things to drown them out. And this takes its toll. Its like listening to a mosquito in your ear for months on end.
So I started my course of A. D. Drugs today. This time I'll be sticking it out for the long term.

I've got to prove to myself that I am better than I have been.
That I'm not a monster who's out for myself.
That I can love
That I can be loved.
And for anyone else struggling.

We've got this.
We can do this.",31Oct2020,1

I have really isolated myself in a “out of site out of mind” kind of way .

But on the flip side I can go from absolutely no interest what so ever , I won’t even discuss Covid . To being obsessed with every aspect of it . Reading every news article , analysing the radio and being fully on top of every news stations .

I’m another burden living among the world, and asking for help is the most disappointing thing I can do. I’m pathetic and worthless if I ask for help. Everyone rolls their eyes at me or gets angry or wants nothing to do with me. This world is too cruel for me. 

I am pathetic. I’ve been the scapegoat to my family my whole life. They’ve told me I’m stupid, or fat, or ugly or embarrassing. But no one cares. Anyone I tell my past two just shrugs their shoulders. 

Three times in my life I have come so close to blowing the candle out. But no one cares. No one will ever care. If I actually did it, then maybe people would finally hear me. They’d finally see me. They’d only notice my cries for help once I gave it all up. If I finally took that jump, they’d see me. Until then, I’m a shadow calling out for help, but no one can hear me. 

No matter how much I cry or waste away or sacrifice or suffer, no one gives any care about me. Maybe they’ll feel this same pain when I finally make that jump.

Not to mention it helps me feel more in touch with myself and reality. The pain makes me feel alive, like I am real. It gives me something to feel that keeps me drifting away from reality. When I want to come back to reality, all I have to do is rub my cuts. 

It helps me cope with all my emotions and stress. It’s not like I cut so deep anyway. Just enough to bleed. So I can’t convince myself that I should stop. I don’t really care anymore. About myself.

So first I think it's important that I mention it so a close friend of mine died last summer and I've been feeling really bad since, I've not recovered from it yet and I think it's kind of the root my problem.

255,"There's a lockdown coming in my country next Monday. Isolation again. This year I found I'm actually a very sociable person, coming out of a decade spent alone, mistrusting and rejecting others, with a distorted sense of self due to my mothers abuse and neglect. I have lost so much for it. For this thinking that I need to be a certain way before others can accept me, the insecurity, lack of proper socialization, and later feeling of living at the fringes of society due to her action that left us in deep poverty and alienation. I always had a variety of interests that I wanted to pursue, but for some strange reason I always felt like I missed some class on behaving naturally, being in the moment and enjoying yourself, combined with my absolute lack of self-esteem I eventually completely isolated myself. Then four years of uni without ever going to class, failing but never acknowledging my problems for some twisted notion that I'll be able to make it up and on my own. I did get out of it on my own indeed, but it took some empathy that I never extended to myself. I guess I did have a lot of issues, and in dark moments some of these thoughts come back to me. I've been angry and frustrated the whole day for instance that this it's another period of isolation awaiting me with the lockdown, when I've been isolated and deprived of opportunity for so long. It's not even true really. It's just difficult to get over the regret of having lost all those years, all of this work I still need to put in, all these things I need to catch up on just to be normal. I wish I'd done things differently. I wish my father would've actually seen that something was seriously wrong, not just trust that I'd figure it out because I always did well in school and enjoy my maturity and independence. I wish he'd have sought help for his issues stemming from the two decades of abuse at my mother's hand.  I wish he wouldn't put the burden of finally making it in life on me, his daughter who was always struggling and trying to figure it out. I am his only hope as my brother, already past thirty years of life, is going nowhere. I don't even mind tbh, I just dislike his impotence and lack of agency very much.
