0,"For anyone who has ever been to the mental hospital, have you ever missed it? My experience was very healing while I was in patient and the staff at my hospital was amazing. The showers were nice, I felt safe, I didn't have the toxicity of social media, and I made amazing friends. I am doing pretty bad rn and am really wanting to go back. But I wouldn't do that to my mom because the expense is outrageous. Does anyone else relate??",17Jan2020,1
1,"My younger brother (by 1 year), who I’ll call Joe, is suffering from depression. He aspires to be a highly successful executive in the business or finance sector, which he would be able to achieve with his high intellectual ability, his personality, and with an economics degree that he has been working towards....on and off. However, he has had to resit his first year multiple times and is currently on a break from university (in the UK we call it uni and that’s what I’ll be using from now on) after being told that he can’t resit a couple exams he failed till this summer, as opposed to last summer when he had expected to resit them. Before that happened he had mostly been doing really well, getting many 2:1s and firsts (the two best grades) in most of his exams and courseworks. But since the news about the whole year of delay he has been relapsing into his previous self-destructive behaviour, which isn’t even that bad but involves a heavy amount of League of Legends, which he is highly addicted to when in a negative mindset. He told me today that he now uses it as his way to socialise because he alienated many friends after a drunken night out; he said that if it weren’t for that he would go crazy. He also told me today that he has, a few times now, considered taking all of the painkillers in the house and consuming them all in one. Since he has a few times denounced suicide as an illogical and stupid thing that people can do (an opinion I disapprove of), this came as a shock.

We both still live with our parents because he’s an on/off student and I recently got my masters degree and am looking for jobs, but our parents are not supportive towards him so he only really has me. Neither of us have ever been able to rely on our parents to help us out with any social or mental issues we were having, and my mum in fact has a negative effect on his mindset and behaviour (and mine, when I was depressed, but I’m ok now). She means well. She is enthusiastic about bringing up two children who have the capacity and education (both privately educated and I have that masters) to go far in life, but she is not your typical nurturing mother. She doesn’t understand us, especially my brother. She came from a different culture - she moved to the UK from China when she was around my age (23-25); Chinese culture is not known for its emphasis on human psychology, instead being very focussed on academic success and the subsequent monetary rewards. Since living in the UK for 30+ years and working as a nurse, she has some understanding of mental health and how we deal with it in this country (and the Western world in general), but not enough to help my brother. Every time she sees him on that game; every time she catches him in bed past 11am; every time my brother neglects to make progress in uni or the degree apprenticeship applications that we’ve all recently agreed would be a realistic alternative to uni, she will get really pissed off and say something negative about his behaviour. He tells me that he is already feeling like shit for being like that, but her being all negative like that just makes him feel worse. And that’s so obvious to me, but my mum won’t fucking get it even though I’ve told her time after time to try and be positive towards him. I can’t blame this on my mother; Joe doesn’t want to either. But the fact is that we don’t live in a nurturing environment where we can effectively grow as people.

My own personal development came from uni, with influence from my uni friends. As a woman it’s different because I can be vulnerable in front of my friends and it’s not as much of a big deal (still really don’t like it though). But as a man who realises the negative effect of our culture of toxic masculinity has on him, yet still can’t shake his traditional masculine ideals, he can’t stand to be in a dark situation in front his friends. So he has avoided social situations altogether, with only us family members and his work colleagues (he has a part-time job as a housekeeper) as people to talk to in person. I told him that his mentality of not getting help contributes to suicide rates, of which there is a higher trend amongst men across the globe. He agrees. But he can’t help it. It’s hard to think positive when your mind is that deep in a black hole.

Today I insisted that he get therapy, which I’ve mentioned in the past but not with as much emphasis as today. He doesn’t enjoy the idea of therapy because he saw some sort of counsellor at uni for some time and he says it didn’t help at all. But I told him that he could see a psychotherapist or clinical psychologist with years of experience, a PhD and specialist knowledge in his sort of situation/issue. He says he will see one next week. But to me, a week is a long time. We have a family history of depression too; my granddad committed suicide when my dad was 12; my dad himself has suffered depressive episodes (which improved with therapy!) and my uncle is highly unstable. I believe we are genetically predisposed towards suicidal thoughts. I had suicidal thoughts when I was a teen. I hate to hear that my brother has the same currently.

Do I have to do a TL;DR for a fucking mental health subreddit? Surely not but I will anyway cos I cba to check.

TL;DR my 22yo younger brother is depressed and this has led to gaming addiction, staying in bed till 1-3pm, multiple retakes of first year of university study, current hiatus from uni, current despair at his situation and subsequent suicidal thoughts. Other than encouraging therapy and listening to him vent, how can I help him?",17Jan2020,1
2,"My friend has been through a lot of stress lately and I think she’s showing signs of psychosis. She twitches a lot, and talks to things that aren’t there. For the most part she’s lucid and is responsive but then she’ll start talking to her phone even though there’s no one on the line. Outside of a few other people and myself she’s started isolating and not seeing/responding to any of her friends. What do I do?",17Jan2020,1
3,"Alrighty lemme get started, some things to clear up for background info, this is my first reddit post so im really new here! I just feel like i needed advice from somebody else because i have nobody to talk to except 1 person(ill get into it later), to start things off im 17 years old and i love to be outgoing for people no matter what cause i love helping other whenever/however i can and i love to make people laugh even tho it can get me in touble, im more of the class clown. When i was born my mom noticed i didnt behave normally (shes an occupational therapist) so i was taken to the doctors and diagnosed with high-functioning autism at a very young age (also im sorry if i skip around a lot i have a tendency to do that lol) my mother has always been so outgoing for me and has been there for me. And ive always been the person to overthink a lot and i  get extreme anxiety often, so ive had a very antisocial life up until highschool when i started to break my chains finally, but up until now. Recently i feel like everything has been going downhill, first im super worried about what im going to do about life after i graduate, and when i got a job in the past summer it was very stressful because the coworkers would think im weird and think im rude by not following instructions even though its only cause i had a hard time processing things (to an average person it seems like nothing is wrong with me) and i feel like ill never be able to secure a good job and keep it without getting fired. And when school started i quit when things started getting really busy. So when my seinor year i was so happy to be just relaxed but now the past month has been nothing but doubt, mostly because when i see everything i do i always think its not good enough and i could do better but am never been able to achieve it. For example i LOVE to play music as a hobby and have been playing cello since i was 5 and have grown to play many instruments like piano, guitar, drums, ukulele, and i also sing. And at home i have a mini recording studio that i use to record myself playing and edit which i taught myself to do but as of recently whenever i record and start editing all i can do is point out the mistakes i make and can never get it to be perfect by myself even though ive watched countless youtube videos to teach myself all i can but still with that i am always finding mistakes i make and end up almost crying cause i want to be good and when i listen to my favorite bands i want to be like them but never can achieve it. I want to come out with my own little album for the fun of it but i feel like people will think it sounds bad cause it's not probably. I want to talk to my friends about it but they dont know how to talk about things like this. And i do have a therapist that i see every 2 weeks but i dont feel like he really knows whats going on inside my head, and same goes with my mom but she understands me a lot more yet she is super stressed out as of recently and i dont want to bother her, so all of this has been making me just be really quiet and more anti-social than usual and i feel like crying all the time and just dont wanna get out of bed and wanna be in the shadows all the time even tho all i want is a shoulder to cry on. Does anyone have advice? Im sorry if its a lot of rambling and i can specify if you need me too! I just want to talk to someone. Thank you for reading!",17Jan2020,1
4,"I've dealt with depression for pretty much as long as I can remember, but I've been able to shrug it off most of the time and live life fairly normally. About a year ago I went vegan and starting losing weight, finally escaping my lifetime obesity. I thought all my problems existed due to me being fat, and that if I could be skinny I would be successful in everything I tried. Obviously that was disillusion, but I never ever imagined that my confidence and social skills would seemingly shed off with the pounds.

I've always definitely been a quirky person, obsessed with niche music and not much else. I've always had a natural talent for music but as a person with very low self-worth, other musicians with their own fragile egos have often seen me as a target, and I've developed trust issues an a feeling of nihilism towards my passion. When I talk to people I feel like the only thing I have to talk about is music, and I end up getting frustrated in most conversations about the topic, a recipe for social failure.

After a toxic first serious relationship and an even more toxic rebound, I decided to give up on relationships. I didn't want to be hurt anymore, but moreso I didn't want to sacrifice my own personality to better suit someone else's romantic desires. Most relationships I see appear to be full of conflict and I have no interest. I came out as asexual even though I still have the desire to have sex simply because I am repulsed by how open people are about it. Before my first serious relationship got too toxic we had an okay sex life, but I still found it to be quite overrated, and I felt like the fantasies I had developed from watching porn were not nearly as satisfying in real life. I recently went NoFap and quit porn, which has helped me feel more attracted to people, but I don't feel like I have the social skills or energy to flirt and pursue. I want to find someone who's life isn't purely about sex and relationships, and don't expect their partner to change drastically for them, but I feel more and more like this doesn't even exist. Even if it does, how would even I be able to pull myself together socially to get together with that person in the first place?

I am planning to spend my final year at university abroad in order to reinvigorate my social skills, and find enjoyment in sex/relationships again, but as the application deadline gets closer I feel more and more like I'm just running away and I don't really have any business going. Additionally, Japan is where I am trying to go. I am learning the language but its a very slow and frustrating process, but regardless, if I can't even talk to people in English how the fuck am I supposed to be able to talk to people in Japanese?

I guess I'm just lost. I have no motivation besides to finish my degree. I'm so lonely and I just want someone to put their hands through my hair and tell me it will be okay. I don't want to feel ugly anymore, I don't want to feel like a bad musician anymore. I don't want to feel like I have to run away but I also don't see what's left for me where I'm currently at. I don't want to feel like everyone is more savvy and clever than me in conversations. I don't want to feel like the least entitled person to happiness but everyone I've ever cared about has led me to believe that. I want to make new friends that I won't drift away from or won't say terrible things to me. 

I really don't know where to go from here and any insight is appreciated. Thank you.",17Jan2020,1
5,"It works like this : 

If I listen to goth music for instance, I’ll hate rock music. If I listen to rock music, I’ll hate my goth music. 

Then it goes further. If I listen to goth music I’ll only watch ‘goth films’ and read books but hate video games, but if I listen to rock, ill play video games and hate books and goth films. 

This depends on my mood but if I listen to goth I’ll want a different future for myself compared to if I listen to rock music. I’m more optimistic with rock music. 

I also change my personality and become a different person.

6,"Hi everyone, I'm new to this sub reddit and relatively new to antidepressants so bare with me.

I started taking flouroxitine back in September, and it has greatly reduced my depression and anxiety. But over the past 2 months, I've gotten sick more times than I have in the past 5 years. A friend recently told me it could be due to the new medicine and a little information online kind of supports that.

I was wondering if anyone else has noticed this for themselves? And if so what they did to counteract it. I really don't want to go off the medicine, but constantly being extremely sick has brought back my depression anyways.

TLDR: started taking antidepressants and now I get sick all of the time",17Jan2020,1

She handcrafted me a stuffed animal that she took hours to make after knowing me for only two weeks. I thought she had a crush on me, so I didn’t know what to do. I’m clueless in romance. I started becoming more friendly with her and now we talk every day. I just found out that she has a boyfriend. They seem to have nothing in common. He’s a popular guy who is not very nice, and she’s an artsy theater girl who is very nice. Her boyfriend doesn’t seem to show much interest in her interests, but I do. I never wanted a relationship with her to begin with, but I wanted to be her close friend because I am a shy depressed loner who absolutely no one who talks to except for her. I don’t know why I’m so sad that she found someone. I was gonna ask her to prom, but now that’s out of the question. I want what’s best for her because I care about her very much, but now I’m more depressed than ever because I was just about to build up the courage to ask her to hang out this weekend, until I saw her with this guy. I think I’m upset because now that she has a boyfriend, she won’t want to be friends with another boy. I’m not even straight, but at the same time I felt like I was falling in love with this girl because I care so much about her, despite not wanting romance. Should I just back off and stay a loner? We’ve become really friendly and seeing her has been the highlight of my dark days ever since my grandma died. I need some advice.

So i have smoked weed quite alot and i took edibles and it was scary i thought it was the weed so i heard this intense music in my ears that weren't playing and everything felt hot when it wasn't and i was walking and i thought my friends weren't real and they seemed weird to me like when i normally talk to them they look at me even when walking but this time they weren't and i was really scared. This type of thing happened to me twice while under the influence of weed. But today was different i walked with my friends to class but they would always talk to eachother but they didn't and they didn't look real to me but i knew they were because i was sober but they looked like what a character in a 3d film looks like. They sorta look real but you know they are not. I was sober and i was with my friend and it happened again and i was trying my best to stay calm i am really worried about me having early stages of psychosis because it happened so randomly and the last time this thing happened was in november of 2019 and im wondering if i should seek medical help but im scared that my mom is going to get mad.

17,"I experienced traumatic experiences as a child and I'm afraid I may be mentally disturbed.

I have a few life experiences I'd like to share.

One of my younger memories of my mother was when I (6 at the time) and my brother (3 at the time) watched as my mother was screaming at my father on the phone as she tried to pull off the locks on our ammunition cabinet. I'm not sure if she was trying to shoot herself or my father. I made my brother go up to her and tell her she was being crazy. She just turned to him and yelled ""Oh yeah? Well you have a crazy mama.""

I used to have big anxiety as a kid, and still a tiny bit now, of when my parents would drive me places and I wouldn't recognize the roads that they were taking me somewhere to kill me, abandon me or drive the car into water to kill us.

I used to be hypersexual as a young child (5-10) because of the stuff I saw on TV. I would often get in trouble at school because I was write or draw sexual things in books.

My father used to beat me and my brother with his belt when we misbehaved. I think he wanted to and liked hurting us. He would say he waited for use to act up so he could hit of on the ass 5, 10 times with his belt.

My father also attempted to murder me (11 or 12 at the time) at a house party we were having when somebody ate his plate of food he has hiding in the microwave. He said he was going to shoot every last motherfucker there until he found out who did it. His friends had to drag him away from the ammo cabinet and gun safe. I grabbed my younger cousin and hid I my mom's car with a pair of scissors while it happened.

In 2nd grade I tried to commit suicide. I've been morbidly obese my entire life and was dehumanized at school daily. I wrote a suicide note that my parents accidentally found. I tried so, so hard to hit my head as hard as possible on the cinderblock walls of my school with the intention of dying, not knowing that that wouldn't kill me. I used to jump off the top of my playground equipment too, and fall without catching myself, just like how it felt when I would collapse on the floor and hit my head. I did it over and over again. I was 9.

Jump to 7th-9th grade. I began cutting my wrists. I became addicted. I then later had sexual responses from it. I now have very scary and violent, dangerous fetishes and sexual intrests.

In 10th grade I tried to kill myself again.

I was incredibly depressed my Jr year, too. But no suicide attempt. I would cry myself to sleep, almost manic, nearly screaming because I was terrified that I was insane because of the thoughts on my brain.

That's all I will like to share, if you would like to know more, ask.

Now, present day I'm scared I may be mentally disturbed as I take pleasure in violent porn and have murderous fantasies that I take sexual pleasure in.

I feel like a creep when I think about people. I feel something wrong in me, like if my brain were a clock it would be ticking differently than other people. It's hard for me to feel love for other people or animals. I struggle with food addiction too but have stopped cutting for a long time. 

A week ago my doctor suggested to my mother that I see a therapist because I seemed depressed (just diagnosed with an autoimmune disease). When I was first diagnosed I thought about killing myself more than I already do. It was all I could think about.

20,"Hey y'all. This is my first post on here so I apologize if I break any rules. I did read them to be safe but I just wanted to throw that in just in case.

I am a 36 year old woman who has had 3 children. My oldest (may my sweet girl RIP) would have been 19 next march and my youngest just turned 12. I did not have very many symptoms until after I had my first Angel but they really hit hard and all at one time. Also, she passed away st 6 weeks old which is pain I will never stop feeling. I have just learned to do the best I can but there is no way to ever not feel the loss of a child IMO. About 2 years after she was born, (she had passed a year and 8 months before this as well) I  was diagnosed with Bipolar type 1, Schizo effective disorder and severe GAD. It was vary hard dealing with those and being a new mom of an Angel and I always prayed it was severe PPD and depression from burying my babygirl and it would go away but sadly that didn't happen.

I do feel blessed that I have never had severe issues with the Schizo effective effective disorder like many other have to deal with. For many years, it was just  auditory hillusinations and paranoia where I always think people are staring and talking about me but for the past 5 years or so, the voice (its always been just the one male voice but the things he says are beyond terrible. (I would imagine anyone who suffers with any form of hallucinations, especially visual ones. That would horrify me) about 5 or so years ago it seemed like all three of my diagnoses became 1,000 times more severe at the same time and I have no idea why.

OK want to add that I am a heroin addict who has been in recovery for 8 years now which I sure has to have something to do with it but why didn't it start until after 3 years of sobriety? I take 1200 mg of Lithium a day, They upped my Depekote from 250 mg to 500 mg extended release and also put me on 2 mg of Klonopin 3 times a day but haven't had them since I moved from NY in 2012.  nothing is getting better and I am so lost and feel so hopeless and have no idea what to do! I am uninsured so I go to a clinic that has sliding scale fees and normally they are still very good doctors but sadly the only I see now doesn't listen to me at all. For months I have stayed in a bad anxious state where I just know something is really wrong but don't know what is and can never figure out what it is and the panic attacks have become so severe that I have called the EMTs at least 10 times in a month. Last week I Passed out from a a panic attack and the EMTs that come every single time I call, made me go to the hospital but after Trying on 4 different BP machines including a manual one, my BP stayes so high that none couls get a reading. The hospital is 30 mons away and it wast until halfway there and even at that poont, the bottom number was 133 which is beyond stroke level. Even though I have felt the same feeling for over 16 years, each one is still  terrifying because of how fast my heart rate gets and how high my blood pressure gets. I have barely slept on months because the voice has gotten so loud and so constant that it keeps me awake. If there are any Supernatural fans in here, it feels so much like what Sam went through when Cas broke down the wall in his brain making him go insane from his time in the Cage and he was constantly Hallucinating that Luci was with him st all times, singing or throwing those poppers on the ground all night which caused him to almost doe from lack of sleep. 

I am honestly not sure why exactly I am posting this but K just got such a strong urge to vent to people who truly understand. My husband is the only person I have who is by my side all all times and doesn't say rude and hurtful shit like I am just being dramatic and overreacting and I should be a strong enough person to not panic.

26,"I’m 17 and have been feeling depressed for 5 years. I’ve been refraining from self-diagnosing because of how dangerous it is, but I’m almost certain I have depression.

I often feel empty, apathetic, angry at myself, hopeless, or depressed.

I think about how much better life would be if I was dead

I hit or scratch myself when I’m upset

I have trouble focusing on anything, plus a lack of motivation to do things I know I’m supposed to do, or things I enjoyed doing.

The thing is though, I can still laugh and have fun with my friends, and I feel happy sometimes. Am I normal and my hormones are just acting up because I’m a teen? Or am I actually depressed?

I’d like to see a therapist or at least a counsellor but I’m scared to because my parents have done so much for me and I don’t want them upset or blaming themselves.",17Jan2020,1

I'm so ugly and I can't do anything to fix it, especially my teeth. I'm going to be this ugly forever. I'll never be able to have a good relationship for have an actual love because of how fucking disgusting I look. i can't stand myself. i feel like I'm going to throw up just thinking about how I look. I'll never even be able to have a good successful life, and I know I'm always the ugliest person at any given place.",17Jan2020,1
28,"I have trouble reading mathematical proofs in papers. Noticed recently (started grad school). I am fine with formulas sprinkled in the main body of computer science and related papers (and rest of the text in the paper), however, I struggle with the appendix parts where there are often multi-page proofs. It feels like my brain doesn't like reading it - if I continue to try to go through it after a few lines or multiple equations and variables are introduced I need to force myself to continue. It is better if I have smth to write on (a piece of paper or a touchscreen) to follow derivations myself, but that takes significantly more time (quick note: my writing is fine. I can generate proofs for comparable problems).

Other than that, my academic achievements are probably above average, graduated 3.91/4 GPA from one of the top schools, 94 percentile GRE scores (Graduate Record Examinations, both math and verbal). My strongest aspect is problem-solving and by extension programming, and performance somewhat linearly decreases as the task distances from those concepts. My reading comprehension is pretty good unless the text falls into the above-mentioned type.

So, my struggle with reading might be caused by the lack of practice - I didn't need to read many proofs in cs and engineering classes during undergrad since I understood most things intuitively, and frankly, they were far simpler (and shorter). Worked at Big N after undergrad, but didn't get much experience in this regard there either. 

I wanted to hear if you've experienced something similar as if they were linked to mental health disorders.",17Jan2020,1

30,"For some reason movies and shows detailing struggles with mental health issues are always attractive to me. Like I can’t keep away because they are interesting. But at the same time I find myself wallowing in my own issues as I watch them. Like I am watching Spinning Out and while I can acknowledge the extremes the character experiences with BPD, I feel like my own emotions become more extreme just by watching it. Likewise, I watched Undone and felt myself getting just as stuck in the confusion and felt like I myself was losing touch with reality. 

I’m not sure if it’s just good cinematography or if this is something other people who have mental health issues experience. None of my family or my partner really understand that level of emotion or relation that comes with watching these films and when I try to explain it they just say I’m too emotional. And that feeds the feeling of isolation that comes with a mental health condition. 

So like does anyone else react similarly? Or am I really just too emotional?",17Jan2020,1
31,"Last year I was forced out of my career by an extremely toxic and narcissistic boss.  I was under her for a year and went from receiving the highest rating to being fired in 6 months.  I had no recourse.  I was luckily able to collect unemployment because they categorized my firing as a “lay off” since I didn’t technically do anything wrong.  But that black mark has stopped me from getting another job in my field.

Thankfully after 6 months unemployed I started a new job this week but it’s hard to get out of my head all of the things that happened under my previous boss.  It’s been a difficult week to say the least.  On top of this my bf has been going through his own stuff and has been emotionally checked out for two weeks.  I’m trying to support him but I’m running out of steam.  I really just needed a hug or a “good job at getting back out there” or something.  But nothing.

I take depression medication and I’m not suicidal, but I am just tired.  My new job doesn’t start health insurance for 60 days but as soon as that starts I know I need to get my butt to a therapist.  But for right now I just need a way to hold my head above water.",17Jan2020,1

33,"I really don't like writing this. It makes me feel so uncomfortable. I don't know if I'm doing this to myself or what, but I feel so anxious and weird now.  

But I think I have to... I don't know. Do I have to be typing this now??  I don't know. I don't know that I want to talk about this. I want to feel comfortable. I don't want to talk about things that may or may not be bothering me like why I'm so weird all the time in my head when I should just be normal.

Its confusing me. And I'm sorry! I'm not trying to type so much I KNOW its unreasonable to be typing  all this, but I don't know what to do. I'm so anxious so often and I always wanna just type and type and type and no one likes what I type and I feel like I'm having both impulses and compulsions.Its not stuff like I can jump off a cliff if I just randomly acted on that urge, so maybe its not OCD but now I'm thinking about my head so much...

There's something in my head that's not quite working right BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK IT IS. WHY AM I SO FUCKED UP?

I don't think about tossing myself off a cliff for no reason or acting on senseless impulses, but I  always worry about typos and how much I'm typing and making things even. I I didn't think much of it most of my life, I have other things to think about and social anxiety and ADHD to boot.

But its so fucking weird and strange. Its not even consistent! Sometimes, I can cook a chicken and pick it off the floor to eat it, other days, I throw out perfectly cooked (or even just undercooked because realistically I just need to fucking cook it more) chicken for no good reason or I obsess over what has or hasn't touched my food.

&amp;#x200B;

But there's no ritual, there's no ""so I don't die"" clause to most of it. Sometimes this weird anxiety OCD thing isn't even some cut and dry thing that makes sense at all sometimes I'm just fucking screaming in my head and I have no idea why and I just keep repeating over and over in different ways that I have no idea why. I can't address it all, because thinking about it makes it WORSE.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, sometimes I'll wonder if it has like an origin for example that time I almost got poisoned but then I'll think I shouldn't be thinking about that at all because its nonsense and if I think about that, its just me pretending I have some sort of problem and making it real and I don't know I'm just going to stop typing now and post this how it is and maybe someone will know something or something or... the fuck?... I just need to stop flailing around and acting weird and be normal. But it never stops, I'm almost never relaxed and I don't know why or what or anything",17Jan2020,1

February of last year, my parents had a pretty rough divorce. I think I have anxiety and maybe depression, I just don't want to label myself with such things. I know depersonalization is an anxiety-based disorder. It can also be triggered by trauma. I've heard people having this for years. I don't know if I can really last that long. I talked to my mom just a few nights ago and I am seeing a therapist this Wednesday. Even as I type this, I can't really tell if what I'm typing is a figment of my imagination or not. I have lost motivation for school. All I do is sit at home on my computer.

I'm scared. I'm really scared and I don't know how much longer I can go like this. It's all I think about. Videos and articles I've seen say try not to worry or think about it, but that's literally what having anxiety is about. You can't stop worrying. I don't want this to ruin my life. 

Depersonalization is one of the hardest things I've ever had to explain. I know what I see is real. I just don't feel like I'm there. I feel like a lose so many things, then when I look, I just can't focus. I feel like I'm searching for the item, but my eyes are closed. I barely talk to anyone, and I don't like my friends.

I'm okay with missing out on parties where I don't like half the people. When I'm not okay with is not being able to express myself. That or that I'm away at school and I have zero close friends here. My best friend is at home. We'll talk on the phone, but we're both constantly busy. And I'm sad. And I'm achieving here, I'm doing great here. I'm doing such great things. But I'm so sad because I'm an extrovert who has nobody to share with except people on social media. I crave the attention, the acceptance, the approval of others. 

So I deleted that for the weekend. But what about my inability to express myself? I want to write a song, but I can't. I want to make art, but it never comes out the way I want it to. And nobody gets how I feel. Hell, I don't get how I feel right now. This is as bad as I've felt in over two years. That's when I was depressed. I'm not now, I'm just sad. Of course there were bad days in the last two years, but never like now. Life has changed so much for me in the last two years that I don't even know how to interact with people the way I used to. I'm afraid that everyone I know will reject that I have some catching up to do on the social norms of the last two years. I'm afraid that people leave me on 'read' only because they'd rather forget they even contacted me. I'm afraid that I'm alone. That nobody gets how I feel right now. Again, I don't even know.

I also have this strong craving for mental power over others that I can’t explain. I’ve researched extensively trying to find out what all this means with no luck.

My cousin/best friend and I have a great time alone but when were with our mutual friends its like I don't exist. I'll say something and she'll give me one word answers and won't even look at me sometimes.

I don't get any responses and go like a whole month and half without talking to him and when he does respond, its a couple words and I won't get another response for another 3 weeks.

I feel so alone. This is my fourth I think mental breakdown of January, and things just seem to get worse. I feel like my friends aren't there for me, all of them seem to be in a relationship or in a good friendship and I am just in the background. The people I really want to hang out don't seem to care about whether I am there or not. This is even harder to cope with since I am still in the closet. All of them are Christian, I am most likely the gay one out of all of them, this makes it so so so hard to hang out with the people I want to hang with, and even tougher to be in a relationship. And It makes it even worse when I see people all around me happy with people who actually give a shit whether they are going to make to the event or not, or whether everything is doing alright with them. On my social media feeds, I see happy couples, doing things couples would do, and deep deep down, there is a part of me that knows that I may never get that. Then I see the gays, some closeted some not. The ones who or not, happily being them, being who they really are and I am terrified of what people will think of me. I can't be girly, I can't hang out with the people I really want to,  I just can't do it. I barely hang out with anybody, since I am homeschooled, I don't go to public school so I don't see people that I would call my friends on a daily basis.

My life just feels like a checklist, my mom has everything planned out for me in high school, and is expecting me to go to college, but what I really want to do for a living is to be on youtube or twitch, doing the things I love, and having a loving and supporting community, which I could really use in times like these.

Last year I was facing some really serious anxity , depression and I was having mental breakdowns in class or in school washroom I even became extremely suicidal that is when I thought I need to see a therapist or a counselor but being from an Indian family I knew I couldn't ask my parents for it so I decided to try my school therapist .

The first therapist I met was not from my school she was a specialist that our school hired who came to school 2 times a week and helps people .... The first time I met her I had a full on mental breakdown and I cried and told her about my feelings and showed her my scares that I had from cutting my wrist and she was really nice she gave me good advice and I left there feeling more happy and relieved ( although I know it's common sense that a therapist doesn't share personal cases of their patients with anyone but still I made sure to tell her again and again that I don't want my parents to know that I am seeing a therapist ) ... A few days later my father was called into the school by my therapist and she told my father all the reason of be being depressed I know she thought it would be helpful but it just caused more problems cause when I went home my father was really angry at me and be said really bad that's to me and yelled at me for hours that just made me more disturbed .

A few days later our school hired another school counselor who I got to know about cause she used to call many people to her office for sessions ( people who were trouble makers or like that ) and one day she comes to my class and she is like does anyone needs help and I said yes she called me in her office and we talk for a while and she listened and gave really good advice and I told her the same thing I told the last counselor that not to disclose this information with anyone cause I don't want my parents to know and she reassured me that it won't happen , these sessions went on for weeks and I was getting better but around that time I had a really bad mental breakdown in my class and I was screaming and I ran away from class crying ( because I lost pretty much all my friends and I was alone and my home situation at that time was worse and everything was just affecting me a lot and I was also being assaulted by school boys ) and I went to her and I said some stuff like. "" I don't wanna live anymore "" and idk if that made her scared or something but she told the head of the department about this who then called "" my previous therapist "" and both of those counselors then called my parents and told them every little detail of my life that I shared with them .

That night was the worst night of my life  , my parents treated me worse than before no one in school wanted to talk to me because of which I didn't go to school on weeks on weeks and failed all my classes and I became all the more suicidal .

My other friend and his family have taken him to a doctor and got him on antidepressants, however he claims they aren’t helping, and dodges whenever we tell him to seek a higher dose. I’ve made an attempt to see him while on break from college, but we mainly communicate over Xbox.

I'm not the one saying that - she says it all the time. I'm afraid that she will hurt herself and not recover, even though I know the breakup is inevitable at some point.

On top of that, I'm not capable of any of the things I am doing against my will. I guess it's my vanity, I just pretend to know what I'm doing and try to push through. The fact is I can hardly remember what I did yesterday. I live in a fog where time just melds together and nothing matters. Life just happens and I watch it while my body and mouth seem to move on their own. I live for sleep - dreams in particular. They're the only thing I'm interested in.

I don’t want to hate people but it seems that every single time I try to be nice and care I’m meet with selfishness or rudeness.

I’m so over it but I’m so desperate to just find one person who genuinely gives a shit and shows that with their actions and not just words.
People always seem very keen to say they care before acting like an ass
Or making plans with fiends in front of you without inviting you 
Then complaining when one friend cancels and saying that you can’t go because there’s not enough people

I might just be thinking too much or feeling hurt over things that happened but I just wish people would show they cared.

58,"Hello! I’ve had a nagging feeling in my head that I’ve been depressed, my symptoms have been showing for about a year. I do online school and last semester I locked myself in my room all day, had a whack sleep schedule (still do), got irritated at them or just didn’t feel like talking at all, had quite a few downtimes where I cried my eyes out, was tired all the time taking naps even when I wasn’t tired. I am a straight A student I am extremely pressured to do well, I really had trouble getting school work done concentrating was so hard I found myself procrastinating and finishing work at 2-3am. Then I feel so guilty about lazing around when I could have been doing my work. It’s gotten worse this year I can’t do anything at all it’s so bad. I felt this crushing guilt about being lazy then I had a mental breakdown on Monday about it. I talked to my mom about how I couldn’t do anything she listened and prayed to “cast” the laziness out of me haha. My stepdad told me how winter could make you depressed told me to go in the sun. My mom thinks I’m lazy, I would think so too if it hasn’t been going on for a year. What should I do?",17Jan2020,1
59,"So I'm going to assume these are just panic attacks but I feel like I should post about it because one just happened and I'm honestly still feeling it and I don't know what else would calm me down except for writing.

So earlier I was dropping my friends off at there house and I got out of the car to say goodbye. At this point I'm trying to keep myself level because I already know something was up with my feelings at that point. but then my friend put out his hand for a handshake and for some reason when I put my hand in his I literally squeezed it as hard as I could and dropped to the ground laughing, so much so it hurt. When I laugh like that it usually means I'm trying to cry or at least that's what it feels like, so when I heard my other friend chuckle it made it a whole lot worse knowing that they couldn't understand the pain I was actually in. After I thought I calmed myself down and they went in I punched the nearest tree a couple times and as soon as I got home I threw up. I'm still feeling gutted and kinda frightened because I can still feel that knot in my throat like I'm about to cry. This isn't the first time this has happened and I'm afraid it may happen again tonight. Every day I have that knot and I try not to think about it but obviously when your trying to talk to someone like that it doesn't go very well.

61,"Hiya. I'm a woman age 21 and I am really confused. I wrote a lot of context about this issue, because I am having a really hard time with all of this, but if it’s too long to read I totally understand-- I titled the main issue at hand below so you can just skip to there if you would like. No matter how much you read, I really really appreciate it.

*Added a tl;dr at the end for both sections.*

CONTEXT IS IMPORTANT:

I wasn't interested in sex and relationships at all during my childhood and adolescence. When I first learned/ got the ""sex talk"" from my mom around age 8, I was repulsed by sex. It made me feel gross. This feeling, however, is not completely epitomized by the word gross. Thinking about sex made me feel so uncomfortable that I wanted to rip off my own skin. I felt absolutely awful. I never discussed these feelings with my mom, because I couldn't even say the word sex without my whole body cringing. Around this same time I was diagnosed with panic disorder {description of the illness, feel free to skip if you already know: Panic disorder focuses on having panic attacks; panic attacks are often caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain which triggers the fight or flight response when nothing is actually wrong. The main system symptom is extreme fear accompanied by some or all symptoms such as sweating, shaking, feeling dizzy and/or weak, heart/chest pain, as well as an inability to breathe. It is important to distinguish between those who have panic disorder and someone who has experienced one or few panic attacks. Many people may experience a panic attack in their lifetime, or perhaps something more accurately described as an anxiety attack as a panic attack is triggered by no particular reason. These people experience extreme anxiety as a result of a specific reason or incident. To be actually diagnosed with the disorder it has to affect everyday life}. My main triggers as a child were things like vomiting, blood, being in new/uncomfortable situations, and other things like that. I was really lucky in that my mom also has panic disorder so she recognized the signs. Most mental health disorders are diagnosed 8 to 10 years after the first major symptoms appear so I am really happy that my mom could help me with this so I didn't have to go through a super long period being afraid of fear. My mom took me to a therapist to talk about my problems and things began to get better. We established that I had obsessive compulsive tendencies and severe anxiety. After that I didn’t really think about sex and romantic relationships for a while.

At age 17 I was a senior in high school, and for the first time ever I became interested in sex. I began to think about sex more casually and it no longer gave me the ""gross"" feeling that I explained above. In fact, I started to want to have sex. Not in a crazy way, I just become open to the idea of having a relationship, falling in love, and having sex. Now I’m guessing I need to clarify that I like guys and I’m a girl. And to clarify even more I *really* like guys. Not in a boy crazy way, but I obsess over my favorite musicians, actors, and stuff like that. I also like romance dramas and movies. When I meet guys I don’t wanna jump them all or anything like that. I had no experience with guys really at all when I was 17. A guy had asked me out once (well the same guy asked me out three times over three years). The first time I said yes, but then he ignored me for a while and it was weird so I was like “okay I guess this is over.” It kind of just ended like that. The next time he asked me out I was 16 and it was a year later. I hadn’t talked to him in a while and I needed help with something a project and I needed it to be a guy so I asked him and he helped me. I had to drive him home and he turned off the music and started asking me all these serious questions like “how is your life? Are you doing okay now that your parents are divorced?” And other stuff like that. I just gave him some surface level answers and then dropped him off. This is when I felt that “gross” feeling again. I was really uncomfortable and upset. I avoided him and honestly never wanted to talk to him again. It was pretty easy to avoid him so I just kinda let it go saying that I just didn’t like him and then that was it.

After high school I went to a four year college right away. I was hoping to meet a guy, him become my boyfriend, fall in love, have sexy times, all that jazz. I remember trying to convince myself that I had crushes on guys when I didn’t really feel that way because my bitch ex-best friend at the time was super boy crazy and she had a crush on every guy she met. I also think another reason why I was trying so hard to have a crush on a boy was because I really wanted a boyfriend and to start my “sexual journey.” But unfortunately I never really felt that way about a guy so I didn’t really pursue anyone and no one ever pursued me either. My love life was nonexistent. After like 2/2.5 years of college I started to wonder why people even bothered with relationships-- not because I didn’t have a boyfriend and felt bitter though. I honestly just didn’t get it. It seemed like a lot of time to try to get along with someone. I also didn't have any close guy friends so I didn’t really know what it was like to have any kind of relationship with a guy other than my dad, my brother, and some nice coworkers.

Around this time I was having some issues with my mental health again. I regularly see a psychiatrist and take medication for my illnesses (I am very very pro-medication). One doctor visit, my psychiatrist broke the news that he had another diagnosis for me. In addition to the panic disorder, I have Borderline Personality Disorder {description of the illness, feel free to skip if you already know: BPD is a very difficult to diagnose disorder and is considered one of the most extreme and can be very difficult to treat. Borderline Personality Disorder is characterized as experiencing extreme fear of abandonment,  unstable relationships, distorted and often changing view of one’s self, explosive anger, recurring feelings of emptiness, anxiety, and depression.} Long story short this illness sucks so much and sometimes I get so angry that I can’t even think straight.

Anyway, when I started to wonder all these things, I went abroad to study for four months in South Korea and the whole time I was there I was much more occupied with all the great things I was doing so I wasn’t really thinking about boys or sex or that kind of stuff. I had such a great time in Korea! I learned a lot about myself. I realized that my bitch ex-best friend was indeed a bitch that made me hate myself and was super toxic. When I got home I dumped her ass (I actually cried a lot and was super sad. I’m just trying to make myself sound like a cool badass). I missed my brother and sister so much while I was away; I knew that I would because I am super close with both of them, but I was surprised because I actually missed my mom and dad too. My parents are a mess in so many ways, but me being away made them realize how much they depend on me and they started to be more appreciative towards me. I really learned to love myself and for the first time I can remember, despite all the trauma and horribly difficult obstacles I have had to face in my life, I was genuinely happy and I genuinely really liked myself.

THE MAIN ISSUE THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW

Now cue the issue I am having that made so much of that happiness, confidence, and comfort go away. The fall 2019 semester (last semester) was the beginning of my last year of college. I was coming back from Korea so I was getting used to going to school in the US and seeing old friends. Two of my closest friends go to school out of state and I wasn’t friends with that bitch ex-best friend anymore so I was hanging out with different people. This is when a friend from a club I was in since the beginning of college reached out to me. (He is important to this story and I will just be referring to him as “Boy” through the rest of this post.) I met up with Boy and we had a great time. We are the same age but he graduated early. Right now he is doing freelance work in the film industry and he has a lot of free time. We started hanging out like once a week and I really enjoyed it.

He confessed to me that during the semester I was gone he got kicked out of our mutual club. I asked him why and he told me that he did something bad to a girl. I already knew Boy was a black-out drunk, but he told me at a party he was black-out drunk and he felt up a girl without her consent. He was clearly super beat-up about it and felt extremely remorseful. Boy is a super liberal guy and really doesn’t seem like the guy to do this sort of thing. Since I wasn’t there when it happened, it was really hard to believe it or even get a grasp on the situation. As someone who has been sexually harassed I before, I felt super conflicted about being his friend, but like I said I wasn’t here when it happened so it seemed pretty unbelievable to me. He told me he was going to group therapy and that he was having a tough time because he hated himself for what he had done.

After a while of hanging out I started to think that I might have a crush on him-- I really think this was because I wanted a boyfriend more than wanted him. I felt super guilty, because of what he had done to that girl, but it was hard to understand. After hanging out a bunch for like 2 months we were at his place watching a movie and he started to cuddle up with me. It was fine and I was telling myself that I liked it and that it something romantic was finally happening. After the movie we ended up in a weird state-- like the vibe was weird. He was being really touchy and kept hugging me awkwardly. At the time I kept telling myself I liked it. Thinking about it now while I’m writing this I feel super uncomfortable.

We hung out again next week and at first things were good as usual. We were going to my place to watch the sequel to the movie we watched last time. As soon as I turned it on he snuggled up against me and suddenly I felt painfully uncomfortable. I started thing things like “I don’t want to do this and I want to be somewhere else.” I told myself that I was just nervous. After I calmed myself down a little I started to get irritated thinking things like “this is boring. I’d rather be watching the show I’m binging right now, and why is he cuddling against me in the traditionally ‘girls position?’ If I could cuddle with a boy I would want to be the one hugging; this is just annoying.” His hair touched my face a bit and it felt course and I was disgusted. He touched my stomach a bit and I felt disgusted. Even though I know that was what I was feeling now, at the time I just brushed it off as being nervous. After watching the movie we were talking about all kinds of stuff. He hangs out with my bitch ex-best friend sometimes and that pisses me off because she did a lot of really horrible things to me and at some point that came up which just pissed me off again.

I’m not the type of person that likes uncertainties and I am also not the type of person who lets a problem be unsolved. I am what you would call a “fixer.” So anyway in one way or another I asked him if he liked me and he said he didn’t know. Well that was kind of annoying but whatever. He asked me too and I also said I didn’t know. Then he asked if he could kiss me and I said yes. I’m kind of ashamed to admit this but I felt like a loser being 21 and never being kissed. I know that I shouldn’t feel bad about it, but the issue still stands. So I really wanted to kiss somones-- or should I say anyone. The kiss was not good. It didn’t feel good. He stuck his pointed tongue on my teeth. It was really not good. After the kiss, I wanted him to leave. I wanted to think by myself about how I felt, but he wanted to talk more. And he basically held me hostage in my own home for a couple hours. It was horrible. Everything he said made me cringe. After he finally left I called my brother and he told me it seemed like I just didn’t like Boy.

For the next week I was seemingly okay, but whenever I thought about the kiss I would violently rub my mouth and have that intense “gross” feeling. I didn't want to think about it anymore, but I thought about it all the time. By the end of the week I was having a full-blown breakdown. I never wanted to see/talk/think about Boy again and I still don’t. He texted me and everything he said was super annoying. I didn’t want to explain to him what was happening so I just told him I was busy and I was going through something. He said texted me annoying stuff like “oh ok...” and “I must have really messed up.” I really don’t like pity parties so it just made my dislike towards him increased. This is really unfortunate because we really were good friends.

It's been about 2 months now and I am still super uncomfortable. When I think about it I get violently upset and I want to aggressively rip the memories out of my brain. I can’t even say these things out loud because it makes me so uncomfortable. Just trying to say “we cuddled” made me so distraught I started to feel painfully uncomfortable and I start to cry in an angry and distressed way. I am so confused and I feel so helpless. My head is constantly swirling with questions like: Are my obsessive compulsive tendencies coming back? I have to wash myself a lot throughout the day, is this related? This is too uncomfortable to just be a dislike of kissing right? Is it just because I don’t like Boy specifically? Is it because I’m not super comfortable with my body (I am overweight and I used to be really insecure but I’m pretty confident these days)? Will I ever be able to have sex? Is it related to my mental health disorders? Or am I possibly some type of asexual, like a gray asexual? Am I alone in all this? Or maybe is this some new mental illness that I need to add to the list of things wrong with my brain? What even is normal? And when will I feel better?

*tl;dr: I have a history of mental illness (Obsessive Compulsive Tendencies, Panic Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder). As a child I was disgusted by sex, but when I turned seventeen I became interested. I went from really hating myself to really liking myself in the past year.*

*tl;dr: I somehow got involved with a friend of mine that is a boy. We kissed and know I have been plagued by this violently “gross” feeling for the past 2 months and continue to feel that way. I hate him because of it and I feel super helpless. I am worried about never being able to have sex and always feeling so violently repulsed.*

I am so lost. Anything you have to say could help so please feel free. You can ask me any questions-- I am totally open book. Thank you so much for your time and I hope you are doing well and feeling happy.",17Jan2020,1
62,"Ever since getting a job as a cashier I’ve begun to realize just how long it takes me to process events as they happen before me. I don’t think I lack in common sense but I can’t seem to ever find the right words or make decisions about conversations. I’m not exactly shy, the indecisiveness applies to my actions as well. I never know which actions and conversations to prioritize. I feel that it may relate to the fact that I have never really felt obligated to socialize and forcing myself to stresses me out to the max. Going from social settings in which I have autonomy over involvement towards a setting in which my action and communication is not optional has got me messed up.
I’m quick-witted and I can learn things quickly but the actual processing of social information specifically is slow. Like I hear someone speaking clearly yet it takes a while for my brain to actually interpret the speech noises into words. I’m just wondering if anyone else deals with this issue?",17Jan2020,1
63,"Hello everyone, I'm a 19 year old male who has for his entire life dealt with social anxiety depression suicidal thoughts low self-esteem and a whole other list of things. I have never had many friends and that has always made me believe that I'm unlikable and boring and ugly (when I do it course try to get the courage to talk without my social anxiety get in the way) and people probably don't and never will give two shits about me. I have always absolutely hated my appearance cause I'm a little chubby in my stomach and my face jawline isn't good and my teeth are badly crooked as I'm in the process of jaw surgery to widen my upper jaw for braces (which has created a huge gap in my upper teeth) and then a year from now I'm having my bottom pulled forward. 

I'm currently trying to find a job after all this jaw and teeth bullshit is over and I'm trying to figure out my career since I'm done high school but it's difficult I'm just really feeling pretty low of all the stuff and chaos going on. But tbh a lot of this has to still do with my appearance. I truly feel worthless because of how I look especially if I'm beside a good looking person I feel I shouldn't even exist or I'm not worthy of trying to approach girls especially the ones I find really attractive. (I have really considered going to the gym just waiting for my surgery to heal first.) All this has grew to suicidal thoughts. 

I truly honestly believe I would be better off dead cause nobody really knows who I am or anything and I would most certainly not be missed by people if I ended up dead or just decided to disappeared it would make little to no difference cause they would forget about me in a month anyway and this is not something I feel like putting up with because to me, it's no way for myself to live plus I feel undeserving of a life as a human to begin with.

 I get really emotional and really cry some days thinking about all this and I just personally feel like just sitting in my bed nice and warm drowning in my tears cause it's just so goddamn comfortable and I feel like if I just played video games I don't have to worry about people hating me or not wanting anything to do with me. I want and try isolating myself because I feel this way I know I'm doing people no harm and I can just slowly wither away into nothing and they never know or have to worry about me.

Long story short being a human is not meant for me. I seriously wish I was never a thing. I have never been at peace with my life as of now and

It's not like I make an impact anyways on earth or on people...Sorry for the really long rant..😔

After reading in r/psychotherapy, I found out many therapists have no problem with silence. They think it's a good thing, it 'gives us time away from the chaos' or such bullshit.

The thing is, all the silence made me VERY uncomfortable. My depression worsened BECAUSE of the silence. I was paying precious money just to be ignored. My silence was not a sign I needed silence, but a sign I need help in speaking. Yet I keep hearing how good silence is.

Maybe they're just scam artists?",17Jan2020,1
72,"Im currently at my lowest moment as of now. I just had a mental breakdown in front of my teacher and a couple of my friends. They were so nice to calm me down, but i really felt as if everything i did was out of my control.

Basically i went on a fit of rage due to me not being able to get signatures from my teachers for my research papers, i had searched on every nook and cranny of my school only to be told that they were away on an important meeting. At the same time one of the teachers had mention that you need to include one more page naming the teachers that had examined my team at the presentation last sunday. I didn't have that page, while the paper had to be collected today

I don't blame them AT ALL, i knew that i should've finished my research papers a day before it was collected. In which case i could've done small revisions. However my research paper was done on the day it was supposed to be collected, so no window of time was available to us to revise or edit a few things. 

And then IT happened, the stress built up to the point i was unable to handle it, i was absolutely frustrated at myself, the only reason this research paper wasn't going to get a perfect score is due to a few minor mistakes that could've been cleaned up easily a day prior.

I was able to calm myself down, but not in a good way. Basically, in a fit of rage i punched the wall multiple times until i calmed down, i usually do this so the shock of the punch would in some way negate the anger and dissapointment i felt. I know and fully understand that it's unhealthy, but as of now, i really don't know any alternatives.

The teacher later stopped me and told to not hurt yourself, but i just felt like it was somewhat a reminder not to make another stupid mistake.

I really hate this perfectionist motto that somehow im living by. While i am considered an overachiever at school, most of my other friends that are equally if not more intelligent than me never had gone into this state of mania. I just really want to get rid of this THING and i would love advice on how to handle and let go of mistakes.

Because most of the time, when i try to let go, i keep convincing myself that every moment is an opportunity, and its either you don't do it, or you do it with the pretense that failure is not an option.

I really want to become better and especially happier this year, and these last few days weren't any better. I have never been to a psychiatrist so my condition had never been diagnosed. Is it necesarry though? Because i had gone to counseling with my teacher at school.

I dont know if how my friends would accept me now, knowing my ill condition. And especially i dont want to end up hurting anybody else. So im in dire need of advice on how to control oneself

TL;DR, i wanted to turn in my research paper immediately, however do to minor mistakes it wont guarantee a perfect score, this made me go into a state of anger in which i hurt myself just to calm down. However i realize it isn't healthy and currently affecting my life in school.

I just want to get rid of this thing. So any advice is appreciated.",17Jan2020,1
73,"I'm actually beginning to really hate myself. I can never do anything right I always mess stuff up.

74,"As strange as it sounds I have struggled for the past decade with who I am and what my personality is. 

I have developed social anxiety over the years and I've seen there are mental techniques that help me deal with it (i.e focusing my attention outwards/ or actively changing my thoughts). Over the years I've come across many different techniques/ ways of thinking that make me more able to deal with anxiety and the stresses of life. The issue is whenever I adopt a new technique it feels as though i'm a different person. I feel a distinct difference in myself and my thinking everytime a new technique is used. The change is so noticeable to me that I refer to them as different personalities because of how different I feel and think whenever I shift from one technique to another. 

There are other examples of different techniques that i am using such as: faking confidence, trying to find the humor in things and life, thinking more positively, trying to be more talkative, forcing myself to have more energy, trying to enjoy social situations more, forcing myself to concentrate on the outside world so i dont miss something out, trying to put myself in the shoes of someone else so i can see where they are coming from and there are a few others too that i have experimented on throughout the years. 

​

The change in me feels so strong that even my interests change depending on which technique I use, my skill in certain tasks such as video games (I quite like the video game Fifa and I notice I am far better at it when I use one personality/technique vs when I use another, to the point other people have even stated it's like they're playing against another player, further adding to my belief that each technique is distinct and has it's own strengths and weaknesses. 

My video game online multiplayer record would also change, I could be in one personality/ way of thinking for a few days and notice I am winning a lot of my online games consistently however for one reason or another I would change my thinking technique/ personality and then I can see a noticable difference in how I play. My play style changes and as a result my win/ loss ratio also changes. I would begin to lose many of my online games then. If i wanted to start winning again i would just change the technique my mind is using into one i know which is better at the game. 

This doesn't just happen with online gaming, this effects pretty much every aspect of my life: the shows i am interested in, my hobbies, taste in music, people i am attracted to, career aspirations etc. 

I notice my friendships/ relationships change depending on which personality/ technique I have. For example I could be talking with my brother and see that the personality I am in/ the technique i am using doesnt gel that well worth my brother, so I change my personality to one I know has a better connection with him. In the past i've even categorised which personality works with which person. This became quite confusing though however when I would be in a situation where I would be interacting with multiple people and where i've categorised one person preferring one personality and the other person preffering another. it could get to the point where I would switch my personality mid conversation according to who was talking. As you could imagine, that was extremeley confusing for me and lead to me withdrawing from many many social situations. In all honesty i've become more of a recluse as time has gone on because socialising became such a drain for me to do. 

​

For many years I was jumping from technique to technique or personality to personality but all the confusion and feeling like I wasnt the same person as I was at the start of the day as I was to the end of the day was very difficult to deal with for me. I began having strange fantasies of suicide just so I didn't have to deal with this anymore (just to clarify none of them were serious thoughts, I just thought about them when I was low because that was one way out of this mental pain I was going through). 

​

Anyway so I thought screw it all and screw the techniques, I'm just going to let myself be. I'm just going to let my mind be it's natural self and not try and change it so at least I can feel like the same person day in day out rather than chopping and changing all the time. I wanted to have my relationships mean something and i wanted the accomplishments i have made to feel like i had made them, not some other version of me. 

​

So i kept it as a rule to just let myself be, not change my personality and to try and be myself. When doing this i felt more natural and more like my genuine self. Like i wasn't trying to be something else and i could just let myself be. I've been trying to do this now for the past 4 or 5 years however i've been finding it difficult as I would get really anxious and my mind/ thoughts would get away from me. Without using the techniques the anxiety builds up and i start feeling so low and even paranoid that I feel I just have to change my personality to deal with the stresses of life. I got to the point where i would last around a month or two without shifting or changing the techniques i used/ the personality i am in, but i would get quite down and more and more anxious as time would go on. 

​

This inevitabley lead me to changing my approach/ personality several times just so i could feel calm again. Every time i changed the technique i was in, it feels like pressing a reset button and all the events/ situations that took place in the past personality were meaningless as it was a different ""me"" living through them. 

​

I have struggled to hold a job down becuase i simply cannot decide which personality/ technique to stick with. I believe i preform to an addequate standard when i have a job, however because i keep changing my personality i struggle with any long term commitments. I recently had to leave a well paying job because i simply could not handle the anxiety. 

​

I recently discovered meditation and i like the concept of developing a seperation from your own thoughts/ feelings, that you can just observe them and not get too attached to them. Using this approach/ technique i feel calmer in general and dont wake up feeling sick from my anxious thoughts anymore. However the same issue arises in me, i feel as though it's just another technique. I don't really feel genuine/ natural when using this approach in my day to day life. It's like there is my base self and i have to attach a technique in order to feel okay in my regular day to day activities. I just don't feel natural when using a technique. Another issue is i find it quite draining having a techanique being played in the back of my mind 24/7. I've read the human brain uses about 25% or your bodies resources and i add more pressure onto it by having a constant technique playing in the background as well. 

​

I felt like meditation would have been the answer but it kind of just feels like another technique that although helpful, makes me feel unnatural and disingenious. 

So i often think i can't win if i let myself be and just try and be natural becuase i get anxious stressed easily, but i can't use different techniques because they just make me feel like i am not being my true self. 

​

I know this is a very strange post and i appreciate if you have read it all, my writing style isn't the best and thanks for sticking it out to read it all. The weird thing is i would have wrote this completely differently if i were using a different technique/ in a different personality. 

​

I just want to know if anyone has any advice or if has any knowledge of a feeling like this. I thought this could be linked to a disorder called dissociative identity disorder, previously known as multiple personality disorder, but after seeing around 6 or 7 different therapist/ councellors over the last few years they have ruled this out. 

​

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",17Jan2020,1
75,"Hello!!!!!!!!  So!!!!! This happens to me and I have no idea why!!!! I really need some help and I don't really know what sub to put this in but!!!! ! I just really need some help!!!!!! I just want to know what's up!! 

It's not any form of hypnogogia or schizophrenia uhhh,,,, I just don't know what's up!!!!! 

Please help man! 

Anyway,,,, have a nice day! 

This is why I don't sleep! 

This is kinda very very long uhhh! So forgive me for grammar, how I type like a rat and how I use wacky words! 

I have what I'd like to call hallucinations. I say that because objects move around alot and some signs point to it not just being inside my head but, it's nicer to believe that it's not real rather than the reality that it is???

I'm not sure what causes this, everyone I've been to doesn't know what it is. I've been to doctors, therapists, physciatrists, and still nothing. 

It all started a few months ago when I woke up one day to a man sitting in my desk chair. He was in a black trench coat and he was,,, eating? I could hear his crunching. It was absolutely terrifying. I started sobbing and he turned and looked at me. I can't begin to describe what he looked like. He looked like every terror possible, everything and nothing. His mouth dropped open and what he was eating fell out. It looked like flesh and bones, and he had a blood stain around his mouth. He stood up, letting me see the white bowl filled with,,,, something,,,, and he started walking towards me. I pulled the blanket over my head, crying hysterically, while he sat next to me and stroked my side. I passed out in terror. In the morning I found an empty white bowl. 

I didn't sleep very well. 

He started appearing more frequently in the night but I learnt that he would ignore me if I didn't bother him. A few days a week I would stare at the ceiling while I heard him eat. He was always in the chair. I chose to pretend he was eating salad, so I called him the salad man. 

Other people started appearing in different places, but they never came back more than once. 

One day I woke up and someone was talking to the salad man. They were whispering so I couldn't work out what they were saying. This new man was called Eren. I don't know how I knew it but I did. He was an Asian man in around his 30s with shoulder length black hair. He had very large and vivid eye bags. 

Over the next few weeks he started visiting me regularly aswell. He wasn't as terrifying as the salad man, but he was scary in different ways. Suddenly, every new face that appeared was brutally murdered and cannibalised by Eren! It was bloody and gruesome. To be fair, if I watched a real person get mutilated, I wouldn't even blink. It was interesting because although he caused alot of harm to the others, leaving blood and bones on the floor, he didn't ever look to harm me or the salad man. But crazily enough eventually Eren became a welcome sight. He was like my guardian angel. Anyone else that would try to hurt me would be stopped. I even began to think of him as a friend. He would play the violin sometimes, and it was always weird to experience him improving. He also liked to read. I would wake up with books scattered around the room, and new page creases. 

The next figure to start appearing was Ackerman. Once again, I don't know how I knew that was his name, but I did. He seemed around 17 and had  curly blonde hair. He had a babyish face with piercing blue eyes. He also liked to dress up as a clown! He never dared to go near the salad man, and although he was friends with eren, he knew his place. Now he was a new dynamic. He seemed to enjoy scaring me. He was skittish and he liked to stare. He would jump out, or push things over. He was full of energy, but if he got too close Eren would start to hurt him. I felt bad for Ackerman to be honest. One day I was at school, I had to collect something for the teacher from downstairs. I flicked on the light switch and Ackerman was standing at the end of the hallway. The light flickered, the bulb flashing, lighting up the room and leaving it in darkness. Everytime the light turned back off he was closer. A shadow stalking towards me. I held my breath. The light finally decided to stay on when he was a few steps away. I cried alot, but I was relieved I couldn't see him anymore. I begun to have a rocky relationship with him. He would follow me around when I was with friends, he would stalk me as I walked home, crawling behind me. I constantly had to make up excuses when people asked me why I was staring at nothing. I never talk about it to my friends. I just didn't want anyone to think I was a creep. I started trying to find out what it was, but no one could tell me. 

I'm not sure whether Bene Kole deserves a mention. He doesn't have legs. He's the top half of a person, but he's stuck in the wall. He can't form sentences but he likes to scream. Even though he reaches out to grab me, if I step away he can't reach me, so he doesn't bother me too much! 

I started taking some sleep medication, as I was running on very few hours of sleep because of this and I was missing a lot of school and extra curriculars. I started drifting away from my friends because I didn't have enough energy to talk and I didn't want to have any nervous break downs or panic attacks due to my hallucinations. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety and more. 

I got fed up. I started yelling at them. Throwing things at them. They would just move to the side. 
I tried to accept them and think of them as people. 

My first ""break through"" was when eren walked in the room. He smelt like chlorine. I asked him if he had been swimming. He nodded. I told him to stop getting water on the carpet. He left the room. A few days later I told Ackerman to fuck off and buy some iceblocks instead of staring at me. He stalked off. I couldn't sleep through the absolute silence. It felt so wrong to be so alone. He returned 10 minutes later with 2 iceblocks. It was mildly disturbing. He unwrapped one and started eating it. He offered the other one to me, but as I went to take it he retracted it and ate it in front of me. He thought it was hillarious. I thought it was a dick move. I challenged him to paper scissors rock, but he won. Who the fuck starts with paper???? Ackerman apparently?? But he started to calm down and once again I began to see a hallucination as a friend. 

I thought that this was it. I thought everything had settled down, but it seemed to be that once everything felt okay, something new would come to hurt me. 

I met Fraizer. He was made of uhhh,,,, TV static? He faintly fizzed. He was a monster of a man. To be fair he was just a monster, I don't think I could call him a man. He had no face and no details at all. He only had piercing white eyes, and claws. His arms ended at his needs and his claws brushed the ground. He had 6 on each hand. Sometimes I would sit under my blanket and scream until my mum came into my room and turned the light on. Because although I could hear them or smell them with the light on, I usually couldn't hear them. I would emerge from the blanket, covered in tears and invisible wounds. To me I was bleeding, stabbed in so many places, in so much pain. No one else could see it. But I would wake up with bruises. And when people asked how I got them I didn't know how to explain. 

At school I would leave the classroom and go to the bathroom to scream and yell at them, to tell them to leave me alone. I would hit myself to try and snap out of it. I got even more bruises I had to try and explain. I started cutting to try and snap out of it. 

I was sick of everyone telling me I was making it up. Of telling myself I had made it up. No one knew what caused it. I was sick of even wondering if it was real or not that the objects were moved and the doors were left open. 

As I lay on the ground in the dark after having a panic attack I started to wonder if I could force myself to hallucinate. I shut my eyes and begged for a knife in my hand. I felt a weight in my palm. I opened my eyes and there it was it was insane. I was hysterical. I brought the knife to my throat and slashed it. I felt my skin part beneath the blade. I felt the warmth spill over my neck. I couldn't breathe. I was chocking and spluttering. It hurt so much. I woke up the next day with nothing but a faint line. Nothing felt real. I felt like I was going insane. I began to doubt if anything was real. I had talked to some of my friends about it but I felt stupid. It wasn't real. How could it be real. What was wrong with me. I refused to leave my house. 

My friends were very supportive and I thought it might get better if I could just ignore it. When they would come around for a sleepover, with me under the delusion that they would protect me I would sob while they slept, watching Eren eat a corpse, watching Fraizer crawl closer every blink and watching the Salad Man stare at me. Sometimes I would wake up to something dripping on my face. Looking up to Fraizer dropping on me. I thought it might get better if I could ignore it. 

That was when I met Marianne. I was playing video games with my boyfriend when I turned around to see Marianne. At this point she was a little girl with brown hair in two plaits with a white dress. She was staring at me from inside my closet. I didn't sleep at all that night. Light on or off she would keep staring. Now she was interesting. She changed age. Alot. Every day of the week I would wake up to her there in the corner, closet door open or shut, ranging from an old lady to a toddler, just staring. The doors would be open in the morning of course but, I chose not to notice that. She seemed harmless enough but her stare wasn't particularly nice to look at. Later that week I walked into the opshop and I found an old photograph. It was Marianne sitting with another man. I did what any sane person would do and I brought it. I put it at the closet she liked to vibe in because it made me feel like she might hate me less. It actually kinda worked which was fucking wack. I decided to name the man in the photo Silas. I didn't know his name but I've always like the name Silas so, I thought it was okay! 

(Almost) Last but not least (It would be least if not for Bene Kole! ) is Marcy! She's basically a walking corpse. I haven't really known her for that long but she thrives! She has a dog called
Copper so to be fair it is reassuring to see him!! Even though she's creepy as fuck, I wanna support people in general and be the nicest person possible, so I always make sure to compliment her so that she doesn't get too upset when the others bully her! 

I finally thought I'd worked through everything. Everything was beginning to feel okay. Things were looking up. Ngl I was friends with all of them now, Copper vibes with me and Eren played me the violin. Everything was fine. 

That changed. 

I walked upstairs to get a drink of water and collapsed in the midst of a panic attack. The world went black and and all these shadow people started screaming at me. They look like the clique shadow monsters ig. Black figures and eyes. I screamed and screamed for my boyfriend but nothing happened. Apparently I wasn't even screaming, but amidst the shadow figures there was a man. His smile was too big and he was holding a knife, his hands were dripping blood. My boyfriend eventually came up but the figure didn't go away. He followed me for days. He grabbed me at screamed at me and my friends. He yelled things like look at me, and make them look at me. It was absolutely terrifying. I knew nothing about him but my therapist told me to make up a name for him. I decided on the name Silas as I've always liked the name. All of the others stayed away from him, very wary of him, only Marianne seemed to like him and they kind of hit it off. 

Then it hit me. 

In the photo Marriane was was vibing with fucking Silas. I called him Silas even though I didn't think the name fit him. The exact same with this fucker Silas. And the guy in the photo absolutely looks like an older Silas. 

And the icing on the cake, is that everyone else has dissapeared. I haven't seen Eren or Ackerman or Fraizer or even the Salad Man? I even miss them!!!! I'm worried about them and I don't know where they are!!!! All I have are the shadow creatures constantly following, and in the corner of my eye, and there are always eyes looking at me. Someones always staring and I'm terrified and I don't know what to do. 

I'm tired of waking up to people standing over me and I'm tired of shadow creatures screaming at me. 

Everything keeps moving around, and I'm not sure whether I'm blanking out and doing it or if my house is fucking haunted I just don't fucking know what's happening! 

I'm tired. 

Im just so confused. I don't know what's wrong with me! Because like! What if none of its real!!! What if I have bad dreams and sleep walking! I mean! I know I'm awake during it because I interact with people and shit and they're still there but! Why is this happening!

Imagine waking up to fucking eyes. Imagine not being able to sleep from the screaming. Imagine the blood. Imagine being shattered. Imagine the eyes. 

What the fuck is wrong with me. 

I'm just tired.",17Jan2020,1

My friend, has been sharing a lot of posts on their social media accounts about ending their lives, what its worth, and idk how to approach it at all bc I love them so much and I'm afraid  that if i make a misstep it might further make them think that their unworthy/etc. Recently, my friends have been very sad about academics,  I don't know how to approach it because I was the only one from my group of friends that 'passed' and I don't want to make it seem like I'm shoving it in their faces so I just stay mum.

Btw I'm talking about multiple people, I know its a hard thing to help in but I just want them to know that I love them wholeheartedly without making them have doubts at the back of their heads that I don't. I can't claim to know how they feel but i wanna let them know that I'm there for them.",17Jan2020,1
78,"So my dad was a very angry man when I was younger. If we (my sister or I) did something wrong he could be very physical, or very loud. Screaming at the top of his voice at us, I remember nights where I was absolutely terrified.

I wasn't the easiest child, I had ADHD, (now just ADD), so I must have been difficult to deal with.

He constantly said he got angry at anything we did wrong because he loved us, and he did it because he cared. 

For example when my sister could do maths (age 7-10) he would occasionally grab her head and knuckle her because he got so annoyed at her. I'm not sure it has anything to do with that, but she seriously struggles with maths now. 

The most he did with me physically was slap me.. Is that normal? 
Verbally was maybe a bit more scary because he was so loud and angry, and could lead to slapping I guess. 

Now I'm older, I can't really bring it up without him getting upset. We've fallen out massively because I've tried to bring what happened when I was younger up, but whenever I suggest the idea it was abuse, he says I'm over exaggerating, and he did it out of love.. I then start bursting into tears and he calls me whiney and says he can't figure out why I'm being so stupid. I can't even get out the words which really doesn't help, I've no idea what to say when he finally ""humors"" me.

I don't even know why I'm trying to talk to him about it. I don't think him saying sorry with affect anything about how I feel

The reason I think I have PTSD is because I can't be friends with guys. Especially dominant, angry guys. My housemate (now at uni) is the most dictating, asshole fuck I've ever met. I've never wanted to hurt someone so badly. I think its because he reminds me of how angry my dad got and it terrifies me. I don't think I'm reacting normally to him. 


I've tried going to therapy about it but I honestly think they're useless.. Talking this problem through with anyone doesn't seem to help. 

He only ever tells us how much he loves us, and everything he does is so my sister and I can have a good life, he works extremely hard, and constantly tells us how much he loves us
...Deep down part of me is looking forward to his death and I'm not sure I even feel bad. I feel like I'm being held hostage to say I love him, otherwise he gets upset, but I don't think I care about him.",17Jan2020,1
79,"Hello all,

New here.

I have a depression and I am autistic (aspergers), and I have recently decided to share my journey with other people. About how I deal with things (or not) and how I am going to deal with things, how I am (going to be) fighting my depression, and maybe in the process of this all, hopefully be able to not just help myself by talking about these things, but also help other people with simillar issues, or even just give them the courage to talk to someone or get help.

My first video of the year I am just explaining some things about me, where I have been and where I want to go.

But I will be creating more video's (not just about these two subjects) about depression and autism.

Hope you guys and girls appreciate what I am trying to do here, and maybe take the time to watch my video and give me some things to talk about, like, what you want ""regular""/healthy people to know and be made aware of, or just say hi to me and to support me on this.

86,"Hi,

I was super depressed.  Like critically and considering bad things.  

I'm in a very serious Kung Fu school.  I was practicing in front of a teacher's aid.  And he was correcting my form.  The Kung Fu needs to be practiced daily and we don't always get to practice in front of someone who is taught how to coach someone.

And he told me I have to smile.  Otherwise I am just teaching myself to be angry.  I thought it was ridiculous.  But I did it because I have insane amount of respect for the Master of the school.  

So whenever I'm in pain in my work out, I just smile.  That turned into giggling and laughter.  

And then that slowly spread to other parts of my life.   I started jogging, and on the uphills I would just smile.  I think my legs are going to fall off, but I'm smiling. 

I learned that joy, happiness, and optimism are wonderful feelings.  But they also can be a discipline.  They can be learned, practiced, and repeated on demand.

Even if you don't believe this, I bet if someone showed up and gave you a birthday cake, and said Happy Birthday.  Even if it wasn't your birthday, you would smile, and most likely laugh.  So everyone is capable of learning this.  

I have recovered from depression, addressed anger issues, I'm super productive and work 16 hours a day, happily.  I even had a huge blow out with my family and somehow it didn't turn into a complete nightmare that takes years to heal.  We just accepted each other's feelings and moved on and started to rebuild a more functional relationship.  Like in a few weeks!

So maybe this could help one of you.  I know you care about yourself and others because you are on this sub.  

So maybe you can work out, or jog.  And practice smiling while doing it.  You can train your brain the way I did.  Hopefully someone finds this helpful.

Keep the effort up.  I believe in all of you.",17Jan2020,1

My birthday was the 4th of November, the Thursday two weeks before my parents tried contacting my girlfriend several times throughout the day, me, being the stubborn optimist thought it was to surprise me for my 25th. I went about my day none the wiser, work, gym, Thursday grocery shop. My girlfriend was overly affectionate throughout the grocery shop, and I just thought she had a bad day.

Half an hour after we get home my dad (he lives 200 kms away) and my brother (almost 350 kms) arrive, unannounced at my house, and inform me, that my cousin who I grew up with, was extremely close with, who was my first ally when I was outed as bisexual, committed suicide. Even now, I have not actually said the words out loud, even though I carried him to the hearse.

Lately, and when I mean lately, I mean almost every night since the 24th of October, I have had trouble sleeping, if I don't have a couple of alcoholic beverages, I struggle to get any decent sleep, which I don't like, considering I'm a PT and prided myself on being healthy and strong. My father told me to suck it up and that his parents were doing it worse, so I guess I've bottled it all inside, and it's cracking through, breaking down on boxing day, lack of sleep, irritability. 

I think about death a lot, but I do not want to die, however it's the unbearable dread of the notion, and the feeling of why did he die, when me myself, of the same age am still here? Is it fair if I was to succeed in life where he is no longer with us? He mentioned he wanted to speak to someone but was scared they'd take his guns away, which at this point i wish he did.

We swore after our grandfather died ""of a broken heart"" that we would always be there for each other  but i failed him and its ripping me apart inside. The guilt is suffocating.

I'm fearful of seeking help as I don't want to be seen as at risk. I do not want to harm myself. At all. I'm just not sure how to feel, or if my suppression is helping me move on or make me more bitter. 

Can anyone reflect on this?",17Jan2020,1
89,"Perhaps it's too early to say.

I've always had a slight droning of nihilism in the background. Some air of meaninglesness. This wasn't depression either. It was a philosophical thing. I had a lack of faith in people. I saw the worst in them. I also struggled to come to terms with death, which caused some dissociation.

So first few sessions with him we dealt with my personal stuff. Big improvement. Then we had a session where I'd talk about this nihilism and phislohpical issues. He's been a therapist for decades and is well versed on philosophy.

So in that hour, I said my fears and he just gave some insights. And they.....clicked. idk, something just 'clicked' in my brain.

Immediately after I felt a sense of...peace. No more droning nihilism in the background. Everything felt a bit quieter and more at ease. And I thought to myself.....it couldn't have been that easy, could it?? A few days have passed and I feel much more at ease with existence and life. Idk how to explain it. It's like he removed a tumour.",17Jan2020,1
90,"Has anyone here been through this or is going through it? Is it helpful? Is it worth it?

Medication is failing and now me and my family are looking into all those brainy procedures. My mother is terrified of losing me after multiple attempts and is willing to try anything, and I’m starting to feel the same. I’m so tired of crying when I wake up then crying some more then crying myself to sleep.

I met a guy during one of my hospital stays who could barely string a sentence together after skipping follow-up appointments. I’m terrified of losing my memories. I’m afraid it would cause me to lose my friends. I think they’re already getting tired of my mental health struggles, and if I couldn’t remember inside jokes or what happened when we last hung out, I’m afraid I’d lose them. But mainly I’m afraid of losing myself.

So yeah, what are some perspectives and experiences?",17Jan2020,1

92,"I feel like I am making this post because I have no one else to talk to, and there are no therapists around me that I can reach out for. 

For the past maybe 1-2 years, I realized that I tend to self-criticize a lot of my actions that I have done throughout the day. Things such as ""why did I say that"", ""will they talk shit about me on my back because of the action that I did right now"", ""were my actions really necessary for this situation"", and many more questions pop up in my head more often than not. I tend to have these thoughts several times throughout my day and I tend to reflect on my actions and how they can effect the people around me and how I am viewed in other's eyes. Because of this, I think I am starting to hate every single thing about myself and how my actions are unrealistic and tend to be a burden to others. I don't know why I am criticizing myself so harshly, but because of this, I can't focus on my tasks because of the depressing thoughts and criticisms that I give myself throughout the day. Any action that tends to effect my surroundings, a few minutes later, I look back and think, ""was that really necessary?"" ""why in the world would I do that?"" ""what will they think of me after they leave?"" ""how clueless was I to do such a thing?"" so many questions pop up in my head and in return I started hating who I am and the situation that I am in. Are there any other people that think like this? How did you move on to daily life without thinking of these negative thoughts about yourself? It's been a while since I actually loved myself and my surroundings, and I believe that is effecting my mental stability right now. Since I don't love myself, how can I possibly think that someone else will love me for who I am?",17Jan2020,1

99,"Well i am somehow in a really strange situation, i have started an internship in a local startup and i really love everthing about it, the work and the people are all great. I do get real and important tasks. For the first time in my life (21M), I have the feeling of doing something useful and getting recognition and praise for my work. 

Now to the problem. Whenever i show my coworkers or bosses something on my laptop or just discussing something with them i somehow get the urge to kiss them even though they are all men too. I have depression but haven't had a phase for like 2-3 years. i never got any medications for it or went to a therapist. 

My guess is am just so love-deprived that it causes these urges. I do have a family which i do dislike and never get any appreciation and not really from anywhere else.

I've had two relationships so far, my first GF was emotionally abusive and i broke up when i noticed i didn't enjoy the relationship. My second relationship was really great i loved her to the core of my heart. Well also this relationship ended because she realized we didn't fit together after like one and a half years and only because she never told me anything that bothered her, i thought i was always encouraging to share everything with eachother because talking to each other is the most important thing. She broke then up rather suddenly via text and now i see we didnt fit well enough and we had some problems, but it took a lot from me and i have trust issues ever since.

Ever since i never had a relationship because i don't want to get to know other girls because i am afraid of getting hurt.

Honestly i don't know what to do, i sure can live with this situation but it is really weird to wnt to kiss your 35y old Boss all the time, especially as i don't consider myself gay.",17Jan2020,1
100,"Hi there. I've always struggled with depression and anxiety but about two months ago I went off my anti-depressants for a bit (long story as to why this happened, I am back on them now) and I had multiple breakdowns where I seemed almost disconnected to reality. Just extremely emotional, hysterical, with no filter or regard for consequences when speaking to an ex. I seem to feel things so much more deeply than everyone else, and it seems to take me so much longer to fully process negative events. When something really bad happens, I usually get to a point where I struggle to function. I've had breakdowns like this in the past throughout my life. Is this just severe depression and anxiety?

108,"Forgive me because this might be a long post for a first time Redditor like me. I've been looking for sites where I could write my story. A friend introduced me to Reddit to browse memes (so if he read this I might drop out) instead of other websites. I haven't really used it since I downloaded it so here's like my first interaction with this.  


Just like the title suggest, I'm afraid to seek help. Well, as much as possible I would like to be anonymous but I don't know how to keep anonymity in Reddit. I also don't tell others my problems in person just like in social media.  Currently, I had already deactivated most of my social media accounts tho, except Instagram, although I don't open it as much as I did and archived thousand of my posts...  


One of my problems is that I forget what they are. So I'm often left sad without any reason why I'm just sad. It started when I was younger at the peak of my puberty where I'm too anxious about everything I do and when I did something that is considered embarrassing for me but normal for others, I imagine there's a vault of memories on the back of my head where I store all my ""bad memories"" and forget them. Looking back, I used to ""open"" it and just remember all the embarrassing things I did, well I don't remember why. Then it came a time where I couldn't open that vault and it takes all my mem'ries, the ""good"" and the ""bad"". I think it took a toll on my emotions as I grew up.  


So I'm already 18 and recently came out to my parents. Well, I thought they fuuullyy accepted me and told me they were open-minded and was fine with it. About my sexuality, hmm. I don't know how to tell you the entirety of it because I'm really new to it too because I recently (well years ago tho, like 2-3) decided to think about it. So basically I was so straight (acting like one though) but I thought it was natural, I grew up like it and thinking I was straight so I thought I was tho. But you know, this is sooo new to me, the lingo, actions, everything! So when my parents asked me to explain, I really don't know the answer. So back to my parents, a day after I opened up to them, my mom called me and asked me a series of questions and lecturing me about what a bad decision this was. Although I was quiet the whole time, a little teary-eyed (I don't want to show her I was crying because it would show that I was weak and am not ready to make that decision) so with all my power within me I stopped my myself from crying and my voice from quivering. Then I said, ""Why are you like this to me? I opened up to my friends and classmates and they treated me the same as if nothing has happened. You're supposed to be the one who should understand me first before them."" then she answered this and it was too intense I went to my room, ""You've become gayer. How would we understand if you don't tell us."" (I forgot to mention that they said ""they already knew"" when I came out""). Then the next day after that, whilst I was having my brunch (It was a Saturday) she went to sit with me on the table and talked with me (Again, it was more of a one-sided conversation as I stayed quiet the whole time).  She said this, ""About the thing, you said to us the other day, you're dad was really disappointed because he has hopes for you. He would understand and accept you sooner, just give him time.""  


Fast forward, my mom's **changed**. We used to be extremely religious (Roman Catholic), I grew up praying the Rosary every night while kneeling down (oftentimes, seiza style). So as I grew up I have learned a lot and of course, in our generation, there is an answer to almost all questions with the use of your phone. I have kept myself but I don't think I could call myself religious, tho I love and respect all religions (I think that is when I started to take a step back to mine). So yeah like I said earlier, she has somewhat changed. Although she prays before going to work, now she does these rituals. I'm not used to sudden changes to I called her out while we're eating dinner. ""Why are you doing this? This is all just a scam or fakery (I don't know the proper term), who do you really believe in? We're Catholics, we're supposed to believe in one God. (I know this part became a little religious, I'm sorry guys, please bear with me) Technically, there is no ""God"" in your rituals so who do you do ""it"" for? Please stop this already."" So that escalated weeks later, I was taking an afternoon nap 'cause why not? It's the weekend. She called me to her room and told me, ""You, (my name), stop with your negativity! You're ruining this for me and for the energy coming in this house! I'm not doing this just for me but for us family!"" (It's too long I forgot the rest) So I was tired and still dazed because I just woke up so I said, ""I don't want to talk about this right now, I'm going back to my room."" While walking back to my room she was shouting, ""Come back here! I am not done talking with you!"" So I was lying on my bed my sister walked into my room looking for something, a charger maybe. Then my mom busted through the door with flaming eyes and shouting, (I forgot most of it because like I was, I was sleepy all my emotions are turned off that time and my sister was still at my room and now stuck in the situation). So she pulled my blanket but could only pull half of it as I was holding the other end. So when she realized that she let go and started pointing at me (I was pulling back my blanket at the time)  


""You've been too much for this family! You think you're so smart, you're not! You have not contributed anything yet you're so boastful! Demon! When you came out we accepted you and you're still like this!"" (My sister doesn't know I came out, well that saved me the trouble) She called me a lot of nasty things which I couldn't translate, but she called me a Demon several times, and for me who grew up religious that is something for me. So when that happened, I officially became the black sheep of the family **\*applause**\*  


Writing this is mentally draining because it takes effort to remember stuff accurately. Are you still here with me?  


This happened weeks ago and as of now, she speaks to me in a soft tone. Well I know she's doing that to forgive her, well I don't? Well, I'm doing all my duties as their eldest although there's really no feelings left. I don't think I could recover from this, I have already considered myself as dirt and demon as they have suggested.  


I grew up having only myself to support me. I cried extremely silently if they ever caught me, I'd get ""lovely beating"" because **men shouldn't cry**. I have only publicly cried in front of my previous adviser when I lost my phone and in front of my previous professor. It really takes effort to keep composure is not? I literally have no one to tell my feelings, problems, and rants. I don't have anyone to lash out, I'm just by myself. I have a lot of friends though, but we're not on the level to tell our problems.  


So in my class, I joined this clique (one of their ""leader"" or member was kicked out and I think they were looking for replacements so I was that one but I drag along a friend so it's not hard for me to adjust) They used to gossip and make fun about me when the classes just started because of my hair. At that time I was growing my hair because I shaved my head the previous year (at the time it was my way to vent? It's crazy I know that is why I grew it out) So when I grew it out, it was ugly, I know! It's all spiky mohawk like spiky. They called me names like McSundae and Spiky (like the name of a dog). I'm extremely receptive, even though I was erasing the writings on the board, I could hear them clearly and see their reflection through the glass board. I may be ambivert but I'm not a dumb one. I never confronted them about this until I joined their clique and admitted that I knew from the start. Then after I joined their clique, a few weeks (maybe months) have passed and I started to smell bad! Like bad-bad! I couldn't stop or control it, I used products to stop it but all failed. It's because my anxiety came back (well I was not diagnosed but it is what it is) then I heard whispers again and they started picking on me again jokingly this time, but I knooow. It's gone now though, I'm really glad. Until now they didn't know that I knew.  


In the clique, this was this girl that I got close to and I thought I could trust her. But now the others are teasing her with a boy who used to blatantly bully me the previous years. Of course, I don't want to ruin our friendship and their growing romance so I don't tell her that he used to hurt me. Then my only escape, my friend, was gone. I couldn't trust her anymore, well maybe I do, but I don't know. I don't want to interact with anyone who's affiliated with that boy.  


So last year, my friend wants me to introduce myself to the school guidance counselor which helped him and two others from our class. So one day I said yes, but when we came to her office I chickened out. Luckily there was a research convention in our school at the time and she wanted to come and I used that to get out of there but I went with her and got to know her a little. She was really kind and extremely intelligent! She gave me her one and only chocolate. I'm embarrassed to talk with her again, I really want to but I can't it's too embarrassing to tell her this story of mine.  


I am not suicidal (yet I think) but there's always a thought in my head that I want to do it but I don't (confusing? a'ight) If only if I decided to do it, I want to do it quickly with no pain. Again, it's just a thought. I'm afraid to seek professional help because I'm afraid of the truth (that I might be depressed). I don't want to open up to my friends because I know they have problems too, I really do, they had told me and I listened. I feel like they'd laugh at me or something like that and think ""Just because of that you're like that?"". This is my form of venting out. It feels so great doing this. If you finished this, daaamn!   


Thank you.",17Jan2020,1

Even when I got my new phone after 2 months of using a barely functioning one, I still didn't feel happy and I tried so much to force it out.


Generally I feel nothing, as if I'm just walking around and doing stuff pretending that I'm alive. But I feel so dazed and numb. However, if something bad happens I usually feel it so much. I want to hurt people or myself. Sometimes the anger takes time to catch up. 

When I start to regret something it lingers longer and its hard to get rid of, same goes for being anxious over something.

My boyfriend keeps telling me I’ve been super energetic lately, and I have been around him. I can’t keep my hands off him or my mouth shut. I keep rambling on and on and squeezing him like a stuffed bear.

I smacked him in the face the other day for NO reason. I just got upset and smacked him. He said or did nothing wrong. 

At work I get nothing done because I can’t focus. I’m either too tired and fatigued to do anything other than stare blankly at the screen, or so excited about something I just thought of that I have to go google it.

Is hypersensitivity like this normal? A symptom of a mental health issue? Something I should seek help for?

She asked me a bunch of normal questions but then towards the end she began asking me what she called “weird questions”. Now these questions were so simple and at home when I’m not around anyone I know I could have answered any of them in like 5 seconds but while there I struggled to answer most of them. 

One of the questions was 7x8 and like I know I could answer that question quick, but there in front of the psychiatrist my mind was absolutely racing and it took me like 2 mins cause I kept losing my place and I was just so anxious. She asked me to repeat sequences of numbers and that was difficult as well for some reason when I know it shouldn’t have. 

She also asked me the date which I messed up on at first before correcting myself. I messed up on the actual date and day and took me a minute to remember the month. I also said it was 2019 instead of 2020 but I think that’s an easy mistake to make lol.

Another one was explain the saying “don’t cry over spilled milk” and even that took me a good minute to come up with my words. 

Anyways coming away from it, I don’t know what those questions are for and it’s left me feeling really stupid not being able to answer simple questions that I should’ve been able to answer on the fly.

I'm 20 years old, so I haven't fully developed yet. Could be my answer.

The thing is, I am never ""myself."" I'm always going through some phase where I'm fascinated by something/someone, and I want to act within that realm...I *live* for every detail that can make me a believable character. I read about the subject and I become somewhat obsessed with becoming the character I've set out to be. I focus on even the slightest details, such as how I move my eyebrows and certain word choices, tone of voice, and so on.

I feel like I have no real personal values. I have lost certain values over time upon losing interest in one of my personas that I thought were real values I had developed. I feel like I have no real personality and am always developing a new personality that I'll use for several months, or maybe a year.

And even when I'm in serious situations, I am mostly worried about playing my character in a believable way. I want to be noticed for my ""personality"" by people through my subtle ways. I don't try to give verbal hints...I'm willing to behave a certain way for months so people finally pay attention to everything and notice that I ""am"" a certain type.

This is compulsive behavior. I get the urge to do this even with people I know won't buy my new persona, such as my mom. I don't try as hard, because I don't want to be seen as an imposter, but I still get the urge to act.

I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but I'm curious if there are any mental illnesses that share these traits. Is this common? Is it just a normal thing for young, developing brains?",17Jan2020,1
123,"I'm taking a leave from work for a few months to focus on my mental health. I've struggled with MDD and GAD for most of my life and lately, especially due to excessive work stress, I can feel myself slipping back into a dark place.

126,"I just arranged a meeting with my doctor, and I'm really hoping I can finally talk about this stuff.  
  
I've been generally sad for a long time now. I spend all my time sleeping, or distracting myself on the internet, so I won't start thinking about my many failures.     
I just graduated gymnasium last summer, and the plan was to get a job and earn some money this year before university, but I have barely been able to drag myself out of bed - nevermind writing job applications.    
I'm constantly exhausted, never feel up to anything that doesn't make me immediately happy (very few things do), spend several hours a week feeling sad just thinking about how I can't get myself to do anything productive.   
On my birthday last week, I had arranged for my friends to come over for a casual celebration, but when the day arrived, I wanted nothing more than to lay down and let the day go by. My parents kept pushing me to help prepare the food and stuff, but I just felt so mentally exhausted.    
   
I really, really want to talk to someone. I can't exactly diagnose myself - I just keep thinking ""I may be feeling bad, but I don't know how far it has to go actually be anything"".  
I can't tell anyone how worried I am about it. 
I've tried talking to my parents about some of the things, like how I can't make myself do anything, or how I'm always tired, but they just keep telling me stuff like ""that's because you spend all day in bed"", which, of course, might be correct, but once I combine it with the near constant sadness, I'm worried it might be something deeper.  
I know they would probably listen if I could just tell them everything, but I can't, and they haven't been connecting the signs I have been able to give off.   
   
Luckily (or unluckily, depending on the angle), I've been feeling nauseous a lot these past few weeks, and it seems connected to the constant exhaustion, so it works as an excuse to speak to my doctor, and hopefully get close enough on topic for me to talk about it all without having to bring it up out of nowhere.   
  
If I could only tell someone ""Hey, I don't think I'm doing too well"", I could have gotten this over with months ago, instead of sitting around hoping for my chance like this.   
I know I need help, so why can I still not convince myself, that my problems are worth helping enough to ask.   
  
At least I can speak freely here, where nobody knows who I am.",17Jan2020,1

4. I try to avoid celebrating my birthday and usually isolate myself that day.

I've stopped talking to her multiple times, tried to set boundaries but she always asks me what's up and why am I not being myself (whenever I set boundaries with her or distance myself from her). 

I've tried talking to her about things I don't like about her and she has tried to change herself too but I think that's how she's born, her personality, it's inborn. No matter how hard she tries to change herself (and I can see the effort too sometimes) she doesn't realize she's still the same. It's because of the kind of family she came from and how she generally is as a person. I don't see basic etiquettes in her and I don't know how to deal with her.

It would have been easy for me if she didn't care about our friendship, it would have been easier for me to cut her off from my life or at least set boundaries, but she always comes to me and asks me if there's something about her that's bothering me. She cares about our friendship but I don't have the energy to deal with her and let her know what's bothering me about her because we've had the same conversation a million times and she unintentionally always comes back to square one no matter how hard she tries to change herself.

I don't know what to do and how to deal with her and it's really affecting my mental health. I can't bear to be around someone who's toxic to me and doesn't respect/acknowledge what I have to say.

My boss and coworker just left for an out of town job and it stresses me out that I'm not joining them. I feel embarrassed that the hour they spent packing up I felt frozen and stuck in my head and like I couldnt really think

I dont think the people I work with understand mental illness so I feel so embarrassed about my behaviors. It feels like something I should be able to control but I really cant and even of I talked to them about it I dont feel they would truely understand 

My boss is one of the most important people in my life, I want to convey my feelings for why I act the way I do since I feel like I come off as angry and frustrated at others, when really I'm just frustrated with myself and cant really internalize it anymore. I dont have a problem with anyone but myself, and my bluntness slips out when I'm communicating with others because I'm too busy being at war with myself in my head

I dont want him to think I'm weird or looking for attention, and I'm really hurting here and hes the only person I feel like I want to talk to. Every time I think about confiding in him though, I talk myself down and consider that he has too much to worry about to really listen to me. I feel too that if I do confide in anyone I'll feel so much embarrassment that I'll hurt myself over it.

I dont know what to do but I feel the longer I go without explaining myself the sooner I'm going to absolutely break down and make an idiot of myself

I want to feel important to him as he is to me, but I dont want him to misinterpret me. I dont have many friends and dont want him to look at me like this sad little girl who cant fend for herself 

I just feel like he wont care and I'm so scared of him looking negatively on me, but I dont want to go on day by day feeling this restlessness

He has told me that he was depressed to the point of being suicidal not too long ago, and started to feel better but now it feels like he’s relapsing. I don’t know if he’s suicidal right now, and I don’t know how I should go about supporting him. I don’t always know the right things to say.

He also has general and social anxiety, as well as anxiety about his health. He also has pretty bad panic attacks (PTSD) sometimes to the point where he’s on the ground shaking and a couple of which I’ve been able to help him through.

OCD has been big on my mind, i think i’ve always had it but at a young age i never acknowledged behaviors as something other than basic human functions. man lemme just spit out some shit that goes on with me/ random involuntary spasms and twitches(small magnitudes)/ recently an unkempt flurry of emotions from varying sources but primarily stress about my job caused me to punch a wall and fracture my hand(or something i don’t have insurance so no professional evaluation or surgery). part of that is that i bottle up A LOT. like this boy doesn’t want to be a nuisance in anyway i want to help and not throw my emotions at people, but lately it’s more just been an i guess unconditional fear of speaking my emotions/ “intrusive thoughts” whatever part of my inner self i’m still in touch with will berate me any chance it gets. i have a lot of random thoughts about being killed, or delusions(in general) that the person kind of walking in my direction not making any eye contact holding a bag of groceries is about to murder me/probably having some generalized anxiety, feels a good bit like what it sounds like but social anxiety specifically is more probably more present. i’m almost never comfortable around people and (regardless of who’s around) constantly feeling like somethings wrong like i’m doing something wrong. although i follow the mindset of not caring what others think and try to keep in mind that their thoughts don’t affect me, anxiety remains a strong force in my life. it cuts through me it really comes with a lot of pain and backlash from myself. the anxious feeling causes my spasms to increase, i’ll avoid the pain of talking and looking at people.//. BASICALLY i can’t isolate one disorder, illness or straight up delusion. my life really just consists of confusion, pain and numb disconnection and it’s pushing me a bit. i feel like i lost who i am, like there was this person who was a little goofy but pretty great i miss the guy man. forgot i’m wrapping this up, i don’t have the resources to get an official evaluation. if anyone who read through the entirety of this(absolutely fucking thank you by the way you’re pretty great to be using your valuable time to read through my thoughts i appreciate and love you very much even if you just get a kick out reading peoples pleads for help) has anything to offer me i will take it i have no reservations for what that may be i don’t even know what i need or what to do what i should do i’m pretty lost lol. that being said an accurate trusted online mental health evaluation is probably a good place to start. maybe some meditation advice, methods that could assist me(i’ve practiced low level sensory deprivation meditation in the past, is that something i should go back to?). i don’t know what else i should or shouldn’t put here but i’ll try to remember to check back here. i’m sorry if it seems like i’m unthankful for your time i really am but i can’t think of many more words. ah fuck i’m just gonna post i’m sorry.

147,"Hi everyone. I made a throwaway for this, but am active on Reddit.

I am a 35F who has had a Borderline diagnosis for 15 years. Today, I was also diagnosed with Bipolar tendencies. The last time I was manic was about 8-10 years ago when I obsessively played WoW for about a year with little sleep and not much care for anything. If you want to laugh along with me (because it's sort of funny, and humor is the only thing getting me through this), my current bout of mania is being hyperfocused on knitting. My kids are taking care of, but I am choosing to knit over cleaning the house, personal hygiene, sleep, and even work at times. I'm slightly sad about this revelation because I've been knitting since I was 7, but I recently decided to turn it into a business. I've made a little money, but more importantly, I have made friends, real ones, for the first time in my adult life. I have self-confidence I never had before, and I was feeling really good about everything, especially since I only work from home, and the idea of starting a business was really exciting. Now that it seems it's just a bout of mania, it's a bit of a punch in the gut. My doctor says if I can learn balance, I can continue on, which is a relief because knitting is something I have always loved. I didn't even realize it was becoming a ""problem"" until recently, and when my psychiatrist started to mention the diagnosis today, I was upset, though agreed, something was definitely ""off.""

Anyhow, now that we're done laughing at the fact I have the strangest mania obsession ever and I clearly must also be 80-years-old (hello Borderline, I usually age slide into my teens, but maybe I've slid into geriatrics?), I have a real-life issue. I have a low sex drive. I have two young kids (3 and 4) but I don't think it's because of them. Me and my partner get time alone, and I just have zero interest most of the time. I can go months and not care. Once we start, I'm into it, but I want to want it (I hope that makes sense). I am on Cipralex, Topiramate, and Seroquel, and am about to add Lithium. Is there anything I can do to want to have sex, other than just doing it? My partner isn't pressuring me at all. But I want to do it for them, and also for me (please don't turn this into something it isn't - no one is forcing me, and I don't think there is an expectation. I just recognize that sex was a healthy part of our relationship, and I miss it and would like it back, but I also don't love doing it when I'm not particularly in the mood).",17Jan2020,1

If i could i would've done it without leaving my room but mom doesn't really like drugs and it stinks a lot. And the only reason I asked my friend to go with me is because when i get high alone i get anxious easily. Today i went outside on a date with my bf and there are soo fucking many anxiety and ""bad thought train"" triggers. I forgot the reason i stayed inside until today. I am not going fucking anywhere ever again. I am not contacting anyone again. My doctor is aware of my deteriorating mental condition, i just met him yesterday and he just bumped up the dose of my pills. I have deleted my both instagram pages, my vk profile, my snapchat.

157,"I just turned 21 this month. Like  literally 5 days ago. I know that 21 is supposed to be young, and I'm gen Z and this is supposed to some of the best times in my life, but I can't help but feel so old and dejected. Like I've already failed in life. I'm a junior in school so I know I'm not behind in college but in high school it was always get things done early and be successful as fast as possible or else you're going to fall behind. Now that I'm officially no longer a teenager or that limbo year of 20, I can't help but feel like I've failed. Like if I didn't succeed by now then everything else is just a downhill and the older I get the less chance I have of being successful.

159,"I know, i know, some may say this is romanticism of mental illness but that's not my goal here. There's so many times that my health has nearly cost my life and negatively impacted those i love. I'm not discounting or negating that fact. 

However, i do want to acknowledge that everyone has strengths and the experiences we go through can cause for some interesting and surprising adaptations for us to survive in the world that on occasion may provide an advantage from time to time. So no, not romanticism, just adaptive learning that many haven't grown a skill for. 

For example, my diagnoses in order of when i got them between the ages of 23 to 34 and now 35 fyi... Anxiety, depression, bipolar, panic disorder, adhd, ptsd and autism (Aspergers). So, some particular ""flavors"" or ""traits"" that it shows is that when i do something, that's all that i do. Doesn't matter if it's positive like cooking, sewing, working, contacting people or sabotaging behavior like watching videos in bed when i need to start my day, spending money i don't have or playing games when i should be working/cleaning. The end result is chronic disorganization and many things (and often people) get pushed aside. So, most of my life I've lived in mild to moderate hoarding conditions. Yes, this has and still has negative impacts on my life, no denial there. 

But there's an interesting fact i noticed...

What do people who have hoarding behaviors have in common with pecan pickers?

They are able to step lightly so they don't break what they find valuable and look at the small details of a pile to find what they want inexplicably faster than most people. So, i was laid off my job and needed some cash for Christmas. I live in a part of the country that buys pecans wholesale from growers and the public which usually pays 3× or more what collecting cans does. It was already late in the season with only about 3 weeks of a 3 month season left. My mom owns about 5 mature pecan trees and i got permission to pick in her neighbor's yard while he was gone. In that amount of time with very little day light (i can't ever get out of bed before noon) with a rake, leaf blower and a couple storage bins, i picked over 200 lbs by myself. Most people do that over the entire season. So, i was able to pay my phone bill and get gas money so i could do other gigs while waiting for more work to come it.

I also have used my lack of selective attention and hyperfocus to produce alot of sewing projects. I made my winter wardobe one year in one day. Also, i even turned some of my ""negative"" flavors of binging YouTube into saving the lives of kittens and prevented a kidnapping for someone else (don't recommend. Please learn to stay alert of your surroundings at all times and know how-to describe your location quickly and accurately at all times. Something i learned from work. Long story)  
Also, since i have attention and memory problems, i have learned to never rely on memory at all. So i have gotten really good at using google products, namely google docs. So i can send my resume on command, remember important medical info for myself or animals, be able to reference facts people told me etc. The way it has helped me the most was being the sole witness to a car accident. I knew the police weren't going to come since it was a busy weekend. So i wrote down what i saw and google docs has a time stamp. Now the poor guy has to go to court and i don't have to live with the anxiety of some dumbass hot shot lawyer being all abelist in my face and cause the jury to doubt me/question my memory.

Tl;dr mental illness can teach you some interesting stuff and sometimes it's actually useful.

I attended group therapy each day, talked about my problems, and helped others with theirs. I also went to the adolescent program involved given I’m still in highschool, and I found a lot of friends by giving advice and just being myself.

Today i have to drive him from his house, to a town thirty minutes away to go to health and human services and figure out why the FUCK his insurance is acting up. It makes no seance and i cant get him his medications without it. (Out of pocket, his shot is 3 grand.) ever seance he was committed, i have been unable to get his health insurance information(thanks HIPPA),  i think they gave him a new one? Maybe? But we have yet to hear a word about this “new insurance.” I’m worried the drive will trigger him and make him less willing to go to the doctors appointment we have set up for his shot (you know, if i can figure out his insurance) next week.

Its just very difficult and is makeing me depressed, hearing your dad scream shut up to himself for an hour commute to a hospital is so goddamn disturbing and i feel like no matter what i do, its not enough. Yes i got him to a mental health facility, but now his insurance is fucking up. And he is now two weeks over due for his shot which means he could go back into crisis at any moment, yet i have to jump through a million hoops to get it payed for. The whole experience is leaving me very hollow. I thought i had a big enough heart to take care of him and help him, but every step forward takes me two steps back.

He’s apologized up and down for it but now whenever i feel like asking for help or feel myself getting emotional about it, I hear him screaming that at me.

174,"So I have this roommate. He’s a homeless guy my mom befriended and got him to move in to the trailer in our driveway.

He had obvious mental issues. He says he’s being targeted. Hears threatening voices, sees things out of the corner of his eye like people driving by and flipping him off, the whole 9 yards.

He watches a lot of YouTube videos from other “Targeted Individuals” which is very unhelpful of course.

He has also been having some kind of legal issues that I think are unrelated, but I don’t know the details. So whenever he has a court date coming up or anything like that his symptoms really come out. Recently he contacted the FBI and gave them whatever evidence he has. So that has got him going recently.

Today he’s just been pacing around the house seesawing between sobbing, and strings of cusswords. He’s in a very cyclical thought pattern so he’ll say one thing, that leads to the next thing and then another thing that leads back to the first thing like that.

He keeps trying to corner me or my mom to go off on his tangent about being targeted and how unfair it is, but we’ve both heard it a thousand times and it’s just tiresome when we’re just trying to watch TV. And since we’re not psychiatrists we don’t have any real helpful advice for him.

All I know about these targeted individual types is that denying what they’re experiencing and suggesting they get help just drives them further into the fantasy. But doing nothing and just letting him work up into these frenzies doesn’t seem right either.

Sometimes we try to get him to change the subject, or watch something funny but that doesn’t even have much success because he always tries to steer the conversation back to the targeting.

Do any of you have helpful suggestions about how to deal with this and hopefully someday getting him some kind of treatment?",17Jan2020,1
175,"I've had people tracking my movements since 2015 or 2016. For a while, they kept someone in the birch tree, and he threw sticks at my head in winter. They come inside and move my stuff around. Sometimes they steal things. I know they want my cats. For the last few months, there have been two police who sit on the front steps drinking beers late at night. They always clean up after themselves, but I wish they would go somewhere else.

The last straw was my neighbors on both sides installing Ring cameras. The one on the right side is 89 years old, and wanted me to bring his mail every day, because his hip was hurting. Then his kids got him a camera for Christmas and installed it. He showed me a video on his phone of me bringing his mail to him. Since then, the only time I have gone over there once to bring him fry bread at his back door. The one with no camera. 

The neighbors on the left have a teenage girl. She will be 16 this summer, and is sometimes home alone. They said the camera was for her safety. I understand that, and I like those neighbors a lot, so I just told them if I ever needed to come over, I would call first and then go to their back door.

I tried to make a suit that would let me go outside without being caught on the cameras. My husband said it wouldn't work, and we both laughed. Well, he laughs. I always laugh because he is laughing, and I love his laugh, but I don't really understand why it's funny. I'm not funny. Then he said I could get a wig.

My wig came today. The mail lady brought it to the front door, so I didn't have to wait for my husband to come home and bring in the mail. I went outside, and I got the mail! I took out the trash, too.

As far as they know, some lady with long brown hair is staying with me now. Actually, I got two lengths of wigs in the same color, so they will have no idea how many women live here. At any rate, as long as they think I am inside, they can't take my cats. They still move my stuff around, but at least my cats are safe.

176,"I think its very possible I have some sort of disorder or phobia and it really bugs me often. There's a lot of small particular things and whatnot but ill describe them all now. 

Ever since I was young maybe 7 or 8, I have been very annoyed by the number nine. It kind of makes me anxious and irritated similar to when you don't feel like speaking or when someone won't stop talking. I cannot leave any tv on volume level nine or I am very displaced. That number is just wrong and shouldn't exist is how I feel. Not sure if its because its so close to being a 10 or 8 but I don't know. 

I often imagine lines that extend off of items or other things. Like a box will have 2 lines come off of each corner and the same goes for tables and really anything else. Well when I step on these lines I get minority irritated and it kinda just builds up to annoy me or make me walk certain ways. 

When I tap something I have to tap 3 more times to complete the pattern and if not I get left with that irritated feeling again. I always need to make it go left right right left. I use both fingers arms legs or even just flexing a muscle. 

Very often I get anxiety about certain things like leaving a charger in an outlet to make sure it doesn't catch fire or sometimes ill triple check that I did something. At work I check every order I put in about 3 or 4 times or I'm anxious and uncomfortable. 

Tattoos make me very uncomfortable and when someone has one, I feel like they're tainted. I lost a very valuable, long relationship because my girlfriend got a tattoo despite knowing about my fear/discomfort of them. After that she wasn't attractive to me. Not beautiful or gorgeous like before. I tried to ignore my annoyance of it, but it was so much I couldn't touch her. 

Often if a cup, plate, wipe, pencil ECT is even near something dirty, I will feel that its tainted (very similar to a tattoo) and I don't wanna use it or have to wash it. 

My silverware, napkins ECT when I eat out need to be finely arranged in front of me or I'm feel gross and annoyed. All my friends or girlfriends have always jokingly rearranged it to look poor and it makes me feel very upset. It ruins my mood and makes me sick of being there. 

This is all kinda affecting my life I feel like all in small ways, but it overall ends up to be more. Sometimes these things aren't as active but it tends to be when I am focused on other things.  Am I normal? Are these things everyone does or feels like? If not what could this be? Is there s way to treat myself?",17Jan2020,1

I don't remember the last time I ever felt this angry. About 10-15 minutes ago, I was so mad I wanted to punch something or break something...to do *something*. Usually I'm good at controllong my anger. If I'm mad or annoyed I'll just go sit in my room and listen to music and it'll reside relatively quickly. 

What I feel now though, is different than that. I want to take my anger out on something. Punching a pillow won't help. Honestly I just feel broken inside. I know this won't reside fast. I don't know. It's like I'm angry but also numb at the same time. I almost threw up due to crying so much. I wish I had someone (though not family, I feel weird around family) to hug me for a while.

I’m worried people are feeding into her mental illness, and not seeing it for what it is, and hoping there’s some way we can help her, but I honestly have no clue.

We are a group of high school students who are committed to solving the mental health issues of today through awareness and policy. The mental health crisis is one of the most prevalent issues facing the American population today, not only the youth. 

We are also compiling a list of candidate endorsements who are pledging to focus on mental health reform once they are inaugurated.

In fact, 1 in 5 American adults experience some form of mental illness each year (National Alliance on Mental Illness), while only 41% receive proper treatment (Mental Health First Aid). This is unacceptable, and we demand action now.

We’ve witnessed these problems in our own schools and neighborhoods, and we believe it is time for us as a country to step up and pass bold solutions to protect everyday people. 

We are also asking you to sign and share our petition (https://www.change.org/p/u-s-congress-pass-comprehensive-mental-health-legislation-now ) to ask Congress and the President to commit to comprehensive mental health reform to ensure that everyone has access to quality mental health care.

I can always be better, so therefor I'll never be good enough. People are smarter than me, prettier than me, friendlier than me, happier than me. I can't be good enough beside them. I can never be good enough as I make mistakes, way too many of them. I just want to be perfect, a perfect daughter, a perfect student and maybe a girlfriend too. But I'm not good enough to be even a friend. I push everyone away by insults and being mean, as I can't let them close. If I let them close it'll be so easy for them to just turn on me, and see me hurting. I can't be hurting, I can't feel like this. I'm not being perfect by crying and complaining to internet strangers, I'm not being perfect for not getting such good scores in my tests or being calm, I'm too emotional to have my dream job or to get into the university with my scores. 

My body is a disgusting piece of fat, skin and bones, too tall and bulky. It combined with acne and personality and my ways of pushing everyone away leaves me alone. I have friends in school, I laugh with them and love to spend time with them. But nobody wants to see me. I'm so god damn lonely, and just hurting so much. I can't feel like this as it's not right, a perfect person wouldn't complain but I just have to get it out. There's literally nobody out there for me. My mother is a narcissist with always bigger problems, father just doesn't talk to me, and why would I ever tell my friends? They'd try get me a therapist by the school, I'd have to go and talk to them. But I know that person doesn't care about me, shy would they? They have no emotional connection and have never met me. Then my parents would get to know how I obsess over any single thing in my life to make it perfect and so they'd think there's something wrong with me. And I can't let that happen, I can't be a disappointment with mental health issues, I have to wait to move out before getting help even if then. I 

I can't let go of anything in my life. If I lose control the person who takes it will hurt me. They'll use the control to make me look weak, and I can't be that. I have to be perfect. And it's not possible, but that's what others want. Nobody will take anything less, nobody wants to see a shriveled mess. We want happy people around us. We want to see the happiness and also be happy. But I'm not happy. I'm so stressed and anxious I feel like I want to just crawl into the deepest part of the room and scream. I want to tell my parents that they fucked me up so bad and I wouldn't be like this, I wouldn't be hurting like this, I wouldn't be this. I would be better, I would be closer for being the best, to having my happiness. I wouldn't have memories with pain and tears for not being a good enough toddler. I want to show people that I can be friendly, I have feelings but it would hurt me, I'm always the though one. I can take anything. But I really can't, it hurts me so much. I don't want to even die anymore, I just want to get rid of this feeling, I can't do anything with it burning inside me. It makes me only see the worst and I can't be happy, I'll never be enough for it. It knows everyone is watching and laughing, it knows what I fear the most and desire, it attacks those things and takes the last happy things away and puts them somewhere where I can't get them. I'm breaking. It just hurts. It hurts so bad and I want it to stop. Just to stop.",17Jan2020,1
187,"Hi All,

Background: mother and grandfather had depression. I am always fidgeting. If Im watching a tv show, I need to also be playing a game on my phone. As I type this post, I am biting my lip. If Im studying, I need to be snacking. Now, here is the real problem. I have in the past 2 years put on 20lbs, and I am trying so hard to be strong and lose the weight. But when I think of ways to drop the weight, I cant, and it becomes a vicious cycle and I dont know how to feel, then I snack. I'm a strong, functioning woman, but the food is becoming an issue that I am having a hard time controlling. It is the only part of my life that I feel that Im not strong enough to deal with. I am worried that I have mental health issues, but I feel a little embarrassed to speak with people around me.

I googled depression and anxiety and I dont fall into the symptoms that describe either. Unless anxiety, which is concern with the future. Im not necessarily concerned with the future, besides with how am I going to lose these 20lbs that Ive been trying to get rid of.",17Jan2020,1
188,"It gets better only if you make it better. Things don’t just happen, you have to make it happen. I know depression my entire life so I know how tough it is on the mental mind &amp; how easily it can destroy you without you even noticing. I’ve learn that the key thing is to just work on yourself everyday little by little even with just small things. Little accomplishments may not seem like much but they do help in the long run. 
You may not be the same old person you once were before &amp; but you’re also not the same person you were a year ago, or maybe a month ago, or maybe even a week ago. We’re human we make mistakes, we feel like shit &amp; it mind as well just be the end of the world but we’re meant to learn from our pass decisions, overcome obstacles that are thrown at us &amp; keep growing as a person.",17Jan2020,1
189,"As the title says i just want to die. I have it all planned out, the method, where, letters ready to send, and whowill find me but the only thing stopping me is my GF and my family. But i just cant shake the feeling of just ending it i have seen countless proffesionals over the years for my depression and ptsd and have done everything and more they have asked of me but i just handle it anymorr. Not sleeping due to insomnia only to finally pass out at night from exhaustion just to be woken up by nightmares in a puddle of sweat and yelling or scared shitless add in the flashbacks and putting on a fake smile day by day as i struggle to find work. I am 21 and have been dealing with this from the age of 9 and i am exhausted and tired of fightning tired of trying and being knocked down again and again and im finally feeling myself giving up and well i dont know what to do anymore. Honestly dont even know why im typing this post just here at 0130 struggling to turj off my brain and wanted to vent",17Jan2020,1
190,"I’m 17,  a student, homeless (living in homeless accommodation but still have a supportive family), and am also in therapy. I’m getting support for my mental health but no matter how good things should be, I never enjoy myself. I hate myself. I hate the way I look. I hate my voice. I hate how I stutter out of anxiety. I hate how quietly I speak and how muffled my voice is. I hate how I can never enjoy being out with friends or socialising. I hate how the only thing keeping me alive is how my family would feel if I was dead. I really can’t cope with the struggle and bores of life anymore. Everything is predictable but I don’t have the motivation to change that. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up",17Jan2020,1
191,"There is nothing more frustrating for me to know that consciously there is nothing standing in my way in reality, except for my mind, which seems to be my worst enemy. It’s like pathological at this point. Things have gone wrong for so wrong I have no reason to believe in myself and I have a habitual way of negative thinking and intense rumination. It’s disheartening. I want the old me back.",17Jan2020,1
192,"Got into an accident December 20th, totalled my car. Going straight at a green, hit with a car turning left. Driver said I ate a red light, so their insurance isn't going to cover anything. My attorney said he'd take it to court but itll take up to 2 years. Insurance companies don't want to fully cover a car for me, so no financing a car. I can barely afford to anyways, I just know a car is important for work and what not. Owe $400 for a medical fee, and $400 for a student fee that I couldn't pay when it was due.

Girlfriend just broke up with me today. She's cheated on me, it's okay. I'm not sure why. She's said that I haven't changed since last October. I am not sure what she means, financially? Sure I guess but then again I let her take 3 weeks to pay me back for rent, so I guess that doesn't really help me when I get paid once a month. I don't really feel like she appreciates me anyways. Everyone knows this, my family, friends. I had a sexual history when I was young, like 13 years young. I'm okay and I have accepted that I shouldn't have. I wish I knew better and how it would've affected me.  She called me disgusting for having that past and so I feel like those feelings are what lead her to want to leave me. She's cleaning right now as I sit on the couch typing this up  I'm really not emotional and I don't want to get emotional  I don't know what to do. I don't know, honestly. I accepted her and her faults and decided she was worth sticking with, though she kept getting caught lying, and just hasn't been a really good person to me if I'm being fair to myself. I remember I had an appendectomy, and her face the whole time while I was getting drugged made me cry. I don't think about it but wow, that kinda sucks. 

Anyways, it's for the best but it's difficult to accept it. We live together, sharing a room so doesn't really help the situation, considering my financial situation, our lease isn't up until June.

I'm not sure what's going to happen. My father said he would help me get a new car but he has his own family and kids to worry about. He's also 8 states away. My mom is undependable due to her disabilities so not gonna help there. I have at least $800 that I have to pay SOON, but I never knew all of this would fall on me the way it has. I'm not sure what to do. 

I feel numb now and I guess I'll be fine but it's crazy. Putting it all together, this is the worst way to start a year ever. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I've gained 40 pounds since moving in with my girlfriend in May, I have no friends other than my best friends. I don't really know what to do right now. I feel clueless, and if anything afraid of what I can do to get out of here and somewhere I know what to do. 

I'm not the type to feel emotions as people do so I'm not sad. I just don't want to get to the point where I'm so low that I can feel nothing but sad. Idk. I just need something to help.",17Jan2020,1
